ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. OK, so this tribute to the 50th anniversary of THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE may seem a year late, but it was actually an award winner at the 2024 Venice Film Festival. This documentary has now gained distribution and will finally show for an audience that remains so loyal and respectful of that original film from director Tobe Hooper (who passed away in 2017). Documentarian Alexandre O Phillippe has a nice track record of exploring popular films, including his superb 78/52 (2017), which surgically analyzed the iconic shower scene in Hitchcock's masterpiece, PSYCHO. Fittingly, this documentary opens on a clip of Hooper's original film from 1974. It then takes a unique approach by dividing this into five chapters, each with insight and observations from one particular person of interest. Chapter One features comedian-actor Patton Oswalt describing his first viewing of the film. With his rare brand of humor, Oswalt provides a surprisingly in-depth perspective on the film, while making some spot-on comparisons to the original NOSFERATU, and the Bulgarian classic, MAN BITES Dog. He even opens our eyes to some similarities to the staircase scene in GONE WITH THE WIND ... the first time I've ever heard ""Chain Saw"" and GWTW mentioned in the same sentence. Especially worth noting is Oswalt emphasizing the importance of the fantastic Art Direction from the late Robert Burns'. Chapter Two puts Japanese filmmaker Takashi Mike in the spotlight. Best known for his films, ICHI THE KILLER (2001) and 13 ASSASSINS (2010), he explains how his younger self was a huge fan of Bruce Lee, which developed his interest in cinema. He then recalls a fascinating tale of showing up to a sold-out screening of Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS, and how fate took him around the block to his first-ever viewing of ""Chain Saw"". This opened his eyes to how movies could be dangerous ... and then he details the technical aspects of shooting on 16mm and blowing it up for the big screen to achieve the 'grainy' look. Chapter Three brings us Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, a renowned film critic from Australia. She provides a bit of a history lesson, recalling the ""Chain Saw"" was banned for years in Australia, and when she finally saw it, the source was a well worn and yellowed version which she compared to the heat of the Outback. In her discussion, she mentions Peter Weir's fantastic classic PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK (1975). Both can be labeled a bit avant-garde as films that make you FEEL something. Chapter Four could have been the most entertaining section, but unfortunately, the great horror writer Stephen King spent entirely too much time talking about other films. Rather than focus on THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, Mr. King rattles off other great film titles like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, THE SHINING, THE HAUNTING, THE INNOCENTS, and POLTERGEIST. Fortunately, he does bring Edgar Allan Poe into the conversation. Chapter Five, the final section, finds filmmaker Karyn Kusama (GIRLFIGHT, 2000; DESTROYER, 2018) focusing on the primal nature of Tobe Hooper's film, while also educating us on the landscape of myth. Ms. Kusama makes an excellent observation about the opening crawl in ""Chain Saw"" ... it really does plant the seed of ""a true story"" in our mind. In 1974, director Tobe Hooper released what would shockingly become an American Masterpiece, THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE. All these years later, the film still frightens viewers and continues to influence new generations of filmmakers. With an unusual approach, documentarian Alexandre O Phillippe pays tribute to the filmmaker and his work by giving artists a platform to explain what the film means to them. Good stuff ... except for that meat hook (gets me every time)! This documentary opened in New York and Los Angeles on September 19, 2025 and expands nationwide on September 26, 2025.",2025,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33029845/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. So why did John and Yoko leave England to live in New York? This film provides the answer. Where did they choose to live? The film provides the answer. Why did John perform his only full post-Beatles concert in 1972? This film provides the answer. Why did they become so politically and socially active during those first 18 months in the States? This film provides the answer. And if you ever wondered how John felt about American television, well you guessed it ... this film provides the answer.Where did all of these answers come from? Well, Oscar winner Kevin Macdonald (ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER, 1999; THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND, 2006; MARLEY, 2012) co-directs with Editor/co-director Sam Rice-Edwards and they focus on a very brief timeline, so that we might better understand John Lennon and Yoko Ono. You might think you know all you need to know about this famous couple, but the filmmakers, along with Producer Sean Ono Lennon, ensure that you see and hear clips you haven't seen or heard before.Much of this is centered around John's only full post-Beatles concert in 1972, entitled ""One to One"". Its purpose was to raise funds for kids through Willowbrook State School. And that's not the only storyline about a kid - it turns out, one of the reasons John and Yoko moved to the states was her hope in reuniting with a long-lost daughter named Kyoto. It's just one of the elements of the film that makes this much more of a personal story than simply a recap of celebrities.The film also works as a snapshot of the era. President Richard Nixon (one clip shows him sporting a maroon blazer), extremist Jerry Rubin, ""The Mike Douglas Show"", Dick Cavett, Attica, Andy Warhol, and Billy Graham all have their moments. The attempted assassination of George Wallace is shown, as are numerous TV ads, TV series clips, and some news reports. The Vietnam War and Watergate are featured, yet somehow Allen Ginsburg reciting an ode to wiping one's rear-end nearly steals the show.We've all seen clips from Lennon's One to One concert, and here they are remastered and sound terrific. ""Instant Karma"", ""Hound Dog"", ""Cold Turkey"", ""Imagine"", ""Give Peace a Chance"" are all shown, but it's the scorching version of ""Come Together"" that really stands out. Of course, we are subjected to Yoko's onstage banshee screeching ... though thankfully near the end of the film, she gets a more heartfelt chance to actually sing.During the film, the contrast with Nixon is obvious. John and Yoko are sincerely committed to peace, love, and justice, while Nixon's politics for power stands opposed. The recreation of John and Yoko's small apartment in the Village is quite something to behold - and remarkable when compared to the photographs and archival footage. When John describes his early obsession with TV as 'a window into the world' and a replacement for the fireplace of his youth, we gain even more insight into the man known mostly for his music and quips. In 1973, John and Yoko moved from the small apartment in the Village to the swanky Dakota building. His wish for the couple to be remembered as ""two lovers"" comes closer to reality with this film. Some of their home movies (with Sean) are played as the runtime ends.In IMAX theaters on April 11, 2025.",2025,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33029955/
stevendbeard,"SpoilerI saw Tom Petty: Heartbreakers Beach Party, starring Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers and Cameron Crowe-Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous, Vanilla Sky.This is a documentary and the first movie directed by Cameron Crowe. It covers Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers around 1982 and 1983, with some lost footage added to it, mostly donated by Tom's daughter, Adria and she appears in the film, talking to Cameron. The original documentary only appeared once on MTV and has some MTV footage added to it, too. It contains songs from many different concerts and shows the group waiting to see how their newest album, Long After Dark is received by the public. All through the film, you see Tom's sense of humor on display and that the group is more like a family than just a rock band.It's rated NR but it contains footage of smoking and has a running time of 1 hour & 24 minutes.I'm not a big fan-I like some of his songs-but if you are a fan, you should enjoy it more than I did. It would be a good one to stream.",2024,4,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33319965/

ma-cortes,"This documentary about the great master of European fantasy and horror cinema offers an immersive exploration of the life and work of the legendary director of ¨Suspiria¨, introducing us to the mind of the Italian genius, and offering us the testimonies of other filmmakers who love his work with key names in current cinema. Dario Argento wrote his most famous films inside hotels, completely isolating himself from external reality and immersing himself in his own nightmares. In the documentary Dario is working on his latest script in a hotel room, revisiting the isolation where he dreamed up his most iconic films, removed from distractions to explore his dark imagination. After many years, advised by his agent, he decides to go back to a hotel to finish his new screenplay and to be interviewed, filmed and followed by a crew that is shooting a film about him. Meanwhile, they are intertwined with opinions from notorious directors, screenwriters, producers, actors and family members, such as: Michele Soavi, Lamberto Bava, Franco Ferrini, Luigi Cozzi, Vittorio Cecchi Gori, Guillermo del Toro, Gaspar Noé, Nicolas Winding Refn, Cristina Marsillach, Asia Argento, Fiore Argento, Floriana Argento and musician Claudio Simonetti who was the main composer and member of the musical band Goblin . Within this structure, a wellness center very far from the distressing places that characterize the cinema of Argento does not feel at ease and has difficulty both in finding the peace necessary to finish the screenplay, and in confiding the his secrets to the crew who are interviewing him. But the demon of cinema, who has never abandoned him, will once again push him to give himself totally.In his beginnings Dario was a prestigious screenwriter in various genres as Spaghetti Western, wartime and thriller, such as: ¨One upon the time in the West¨, ¨Oggi a me... domani a te!¨, ¨Cemetery without crosses¨, ¨Battlee of Commandos¨, ¨Commando¨, ¨Every Man Is My Enemy¨. Dario then created the 'Animal Trilogy', whose film titles were influenced by a magician from Turin. His first important movie was ¨The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"" that became an international hit, despite having continuous discussions with the main star, Tony Musante, who even claimed some authorship of the story. Argento followed up with two more thrillers, ¨The Cat o' Nine Tails¨ (1971), starring Karl Malden and James Franciscus, and ¨Four Flies on Grey Velvet¨(1971) starring Michael Brandon and Mimsy Farmer whose character and aspect bears remarkable resemblance to wife Nocolodi which made her quite angry. These films were backed by his father Salvatore Argento who was the major promoter and producer, who financed all his projects and sometimes limited the highly imaginative and expensive productions that came out of Dario's mind. He then went back to directing so-called ""giallo"" thrillers, starting with ¨Deep Red¨ (1975), a violent mystery-thriller starring David Hemmings that inspired a number of international directors in the thriller-horror genre. His next work was ¨Suspiria¨ (1977), his masterpiece, a surreal horror film about a witch's coven that was inspired by the Gothic fairy tales of the Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Anderson, which he also wrote in collaboration with his girlfriend, screenwriter/actress Daria Nicolodi, who acted in ""Profondo Rosso"" (""Deep Red"") and most of Argento's films from then to the late 1980s. However, due to some vicissitudes, discussions and the little recognition of Nicolodi's authorship, it gave rise to the sad marital separation between her and Dario, which caused him deep sorrow. Argento advanced the unfinished trilogy with ¨Inferno¨ (1980), before returning to the ""giallo"" genre with ¨Tenebrae¨(1982), a sort of gory whodunit, and then with the haunting ¨Phenomena¨ (1985) with a very young actress: Jennifer Connellly.Argento got a big hit in North America, as he temporarily settled in the US, where he collaborated with director George A. Romero on the two-part horror-thriller ¨Two Evil Eyes¨ (1990) (he had previously collaborated with Romero on the horror action thriller ¨Dawn of the Dead¨ (1978)). While still living in America, Argento appeared in small roles in several films and directed another violent mystery thriller, ¨Trauma¨ (1993), which starred his youngest daughter Asia Argento from his long-term relationship with Nicolodi. Argento returned to Italy in 1995, where he made a comeback in the horror genre with ¨The Stendhal Syndrome¨ (1996) and then with another version of ""Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera"",¨ The Phantom of the Opera¨ (1998), both of which starred Asia, in this last film she had her first on-screen love scene in front of her father, and where Asia said she lost her virginity. Most recently, Argento directed a number of ""giallo"" mystery thrillers such as: ¨Sleepless¨ (2001), ¨The Card Player¨ (2003) and ¨Do You Like Hitchcock?¨ (2005), as well as two gory, supernatural-themed episodes of the USA TV cable anthology series ¨Masters of Horror¨ (2005). Having always wanted to make a third chapter to his ""Three Mothers"" horror films, Argento finally completed the trilogy in 2007 with the release of ¨Mother of Tears¨ (2007), which starred Asia Argento as a young woman trying to identify and stop the last surviving evil witch from taking over the world. In addition to his Gothic and violent style of storytelling, ""La terza madre"" has many references to two of his previous films, ""Suspiria"" (1997) and ""Inferno"" (1980), which is a must for fans of the trilogy.The documentary titled¨ Dario Argento: Panico¨(2023) was well directed by Simone Scafidi who, together with his production team, documents his life, including formative interviews and illustrating us extensively about Dario's career. Simone is a director and screenwriter specialized in the world of documentary. Among his works are: ¨Zanetti story¨ (2015) and ¨Fulci for Fake¨ (2019).",2024,1,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27728888/

ksf-2,"Released in 2023. A documentary on netflix. Discusses the freedoms that germans had prior to the nazis coming to power in the 1930s. This time was known as the weimar republic in germany. Lots of time spent on recreating scenes of couples dancing, kissing, and just having fun in the eldorado nightclub in berlin. The narrator spends some time talking about ernst rohm. An angry, gay, violent man. And close friend of adolf hitler. The narrator highlights several couples, who actually lived and had relationships at the time. Then rohm was made head of the SA, the group responsible for arrests, and putting people in jail. And apparently only too happy to disrupt the quiet, calm way of life in berlin. Suddenly, being queer, trans, or homosexual was against the law. At first, germany provided passes to trans persons, allowing them fre travel. Until it was all no longer okay. This was a huge change. Of course, the nightclub was closed, and used by the third reicht. The medical institute assisting the trans people is destroyed, and its books burned. A sad chapter in history. Directed by benjamin cantu, matt lambert. It's quite good!

ma-cortes,"¨Day of the Champion¨ may be the greatest movie ever made. In 1965, Steve McQueen abandoned his attempt to make the definitive Formula 1 movie midway through filming. This is a car racing documentary narrated by David Letterman that Hollywood legend and avid racing fan Steve McQueen started production on in the mid-1960s as his passion project, but never completed. Documentary about the Warner Bros Formula One movie 'Day of the Champion' featuring Steve McQueen; and the race to beat 'Grand Prix' to the big screen. Includes footage of the 1965 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring and Monaco and footage that was made for the movie shot 50 years ago; thought to have been lost forever until its recent accidental discovery.John Sturges and his friend Steve McQuuen attempted to adapt Robert Daily's book 'The Cruel Sport' to make the best racing film in history, hiring the best Formula 1 race car drivers: Jackie Stewart, Sterling, John Withmore. However, at the same time a similar project financed by MGM was born: ¨Grand Prix¨ produced and directed by James Frankenheimer with James Garner, Yves Montand, Antonio Sabato. There was then strong competition between the two projects, the one financed by MGM and the one produced by Warner Bros, ""The Day of the Champion"", which was supposed to be more serious and made by the best car specialists. In order to shoot the film, the best British cameraman John Wilcox was shot for panoramic and anamorphic giant screen. There was therefore a competition to shoot the two films, similar to what would happen years later with the pictures: ¨Dangerous Liaisons-Valmont¨ and ¨Tombstone-Wyatt Earp¨. The latter coproduced by Sturges/McQueen failed and went down the drain, being a complete disappointment for Steve who considered it the purport of his life as an expert driver.There is also a special remembrance of McQueen's career: His first roles were in TV series, such as: West Point, Trackdow, Tales of Wells Fargo. His important first role in ¨Never So Few ¨(1959) was originally going to be played by Sammy Davis Jr, but thanks to Frank Sinatra was to Steve. When MacQueen went to England to shot along with Robert Wagner: ¨Philip Leacock's The War Lover¨ (1962), he spent his time looking for race tracks and practicing with high-speed cars. When he briefly left ¨John Sturges' The Great Escape¨ (1963) during filming, due to the fact that his character did not play as large a part as he would have liked, it was James Garner (his friend and immediate next door neighbor in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California,) who convinced him to return (however, when Steve found out that Garner took the role of Grand Prix, he stopped talking to him.) . Because of the huge success and continuing popularity of the film, it has become his best known role. ¨The Sand Pebbles ¨(1966) was another big hit, when he was in China filming it, he found out that Warner Bros had scrapped ¨The day of the Champion¨, the frustration that this caused him could have increased the severity of the cancer that was still in its early stages. In several films he did most of his own stunts : ¨Le Mans¨, ¨The Getaway¨, ¨Bullitt¨, ¨The great escape¨ with the motorcycle, ¨The Hunter¨ demonstrated McQueen's skill as an expert car driver, these scenes were done without stuntmen and at his own risk.",2025,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12381962/

ma-cortes,"A fine documentary about the world of bullfighting showing the reality of the bullfight, displayng colorful images and stunning close-ups of the two contenders in rhe ring: the torero and the Bull. It exposes the intimate experience of the bullfighter, his religiosity, and adoration of the Virgin Mary, his sacrifice and path to fame, his rites of dress and suit of lights, along with the assumption of the risk of facing a deadly duel as a personal duty, following a tradition that has been sustained por centuries. In fact, bullfighting, as an art form has already been profusely painted and praised by prestigious artists such as Goya, Picasso, Rafael Alberti, and many others. The director himself -who is not a bullfighting enthusiast- said he wanted to film it seriously and objectively, representing an aesthetic challenge for him. He attempts to accept it as it is, and show it in all its rawness and reality, including the gushing blood, as toro as toreador, and the harshness of the Plaza. According to some bullfighting critics, he is credited for portraying that world as it is, the naked truth.The documentary faithfully portrays the splendid figure of the great bullfighter, Andrés Roca Rey as he faces the bull. His face , his grimaces, his face, as well as bull's bravery with its tirelessness in confronting the opponent in order to gore him. And it definitively shows a certain admiration that develops between bullfighter and beast. According to the director, there was a commmitment of the highest level on the part of the toreador Roca Rey. He states the film has not generated controversy or international rejection and is interesting in its own right as an anthropological document. The movie develops a beauty that emerges intermittently through a violent struggle between a man and a beast, both confronting each other to the death, one with his sword and the other with its sharp horns, a confrontation between animality brutality and human racionality.",2025,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26245982/

classicsoncall,"SpoilerI don't doubt Gabriel Iglesias when he stated near the end of his program that this was the greatest night of his life. I can't imagine any one single individual selling out Dodger Stadium for a one man show, but Fluffy did it and an overhead shot of the stadium confirmed it. But I didn't get the impression this was an evening of entertainment, but more a reflection on Gabriel's life and personal situations that got him to where he is today. As such, there was not a lot of humor in his delivery, even when riffing on subjects like the Covid-19 pandemic, waiting on line at Starbucks, Halloween with son Frankie, or his introduction to country music. This would have been informative in an interview format with a host asking questions and Gabriel answering; it almost felt like an interview without a host. And stretching the show out to two hours made it somewhat of a chore to sit through. More than once I thought that this wasn't funny, although I did persevere to the end. I do believe Gabriel Iglesias was honest in his reflections and truly humbled by the experience of performing in such a huge venue, and it may have been a Netflix special, but it wasn't really a comedy show.",2023,5,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21639094/

classicsoncall,"SpoilerI don't know how, but I was never aware of Stevie Ray Vaughan until well after he died in a helicopter crash, chronicled in this documentary by his brother Jimmie. I'm sorry I missed the brothers and their music, though I now look them up on You tube and thrill to their wonderful brand of blues music. This documentary features Jimmie Vaughan talking about growing up in Cliff Oak, Texas and how both he and Stevie picked up guitars at an early age and virtually self-taught themselves to play. In Jimmie's case, it came as a result of a broken collarbone from a high school football injury; his father bought him a fifty dollar guitar which he took to immediately. The early years of teenage bands and moving up in stature via recognition by music industry pros launched the boys, especially Stevie, to the heights of electric guitar success. So successful was Jimmie that he wound up making more money than his dad while still a teenager playing local gigs. Alongside Jimmie are music legends like Eric Clapton, Jackson Browne, Billy Gibbons and producer Nile Rodgers speaking of their fondness for the siblings, and lamenting the passing of a guitar god legend like Stevie, a life cut short at only thirty five. Old time and future fans of the Vaughan Brothers owe it to themselves to take a look at this informative documentary with only one slight downside - there's not enough music to satisfy the average blues fan.",2024,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22409096/
imseeg,"No famous musicians or celebrities are being interviewed. No Jimi Hendrix interviews either, we only get to hear and see the recording engineers who built and ran the studio with several Hendrix outakes of recordings that didnt make it to the album. And what bliss to hear those engineers recollect their memories of the birth of Jimi Hendrix' recording room in Manhattan, New York City.Jimi was always full of ideas which he couldnt immediately translate into work because of the incredibly expensive recording studios which already had costed Jimi a fortune. He didnt like the cold and soulless atmospheres of the usual recording studios either, hence his wish to build one of his own! And so he did!Jimi's input into the design was especially geared towards the lighting, because he wished to be surrounded by a warm atmosphere, hence his wish to have different light colors available for any mood he was into.A really fun and detailed look into how this magical Jimi Hendrix studio came to be. Highly recommended for Jimi Hendrix fans! And now I gonna listen to Electric Ladyland, which still blows my mind to this very day!",2024,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33071166/

boblipton,"Why bother with film preservation? Who are the people who do the work? How do they do it? This ambitious and successful feature about the archivists, the preservationists, and the restorers answers those questions.It begins with the nuts, like Henri Langlois and Iris Barry, collectors convinced that there's something there, and moves towards the current generation, who seem to view film like people; one gestures towards the camera negatives of GONE WITH THE WIND and notes that everyone involved in the production is now dead, but the negative was on the same sound stage as Clark Gable. Then it's on to the job of saving and preserving and restoring, and why, and what comes next.Frankly, given the transitory nature of all the media they talk about, I think they should go back to paper prints for the archival copies, on acid-free paper. They're pulling high-definition film prints off paper prints from 1905, and with good paper, you're talking about half a millennium easily. As compared to 50 for nitrate, and five for digital.In any case, this is a heartfelt and compelling documentary about its subject. It certainly appealed to my taste for early cinema.",2023,1,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15439196/

paul_m_haakonsen,"Now, I was not familiar with comedian Andrew Schulz prior to stumbling upon the 2025 stand-up comedy special ""Andrew Schulz: Life"" on Netflix. And since I had never seen him perform before, of course I opted to check out his comedy. The contents of the show was fair enough, though there is a lot of focus on below-the-belt material, which sort of grew a bit tiring and felt like it was yanked out of the 1990s. I had hoped and expected a bit more proper comedy, I have to admit, that I am well-past the below-the-belt type of comedy. But there were some good moments here and there throughout the 59 minutes that the show ran for. Andrew Schulz does have a good charisma and feels very natural on the stage. However, the frequent mustache twirl was a bit distracting. I found this show to be fair enjoyable and entertaining, though it is hardly a show that warrants more than a single viewing. My rating of ""Andrew Schulz: Life"" lands on a five out of ten stars.",2025,4,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt35705915/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness (on the edge of town). What keeps a band together for decades? It could be the shared love of music ... although many bands have split up with members continuing on in solo careers. It could be a love of performing ... but again, a band isn't needed for that. It could be friendship or family ... lifelong friends Paul and John couldn't save The Beatles, and a brotherly feud broke up Creedence Clearwater Revival. Certainly ""luck"" plays a role ... too many deaths to count have caused the demise of bands through the years. Although no clear answer exists, it's likely a blend of all the above combined with a certain spiritual bonding. Nowhere is that more evident than with the E Street Band. Of course, the band has a dynamic leader in (the once shy) Bruce Springsteen, but it's obvious these musicians like and respect each other, and very much value what they have built together.Having been a Springsteen fan since the early 1970's, I can't possibly be overly objective towards Thom Zimny's documentary, so you've been warned. Zimny released THE BEACH BOYS documentary earlies this year, and he has a long-standing affiliation with Springsteen on music videos and other documentaries, including LETTER TO YOU (2020) and WESTERN STARS (2019). This latest is centered on the band's 2023 tour, their first in six years and first since the pandemic. However, rather than a traditional concert flick, Zimny takes us behind the scenes for the band's reunion, early rehearsals, and process while on the road. Most insightful are the musings from the individual band members, while Bruce's narration provides some structure to the film.Bruce kicks us off by recalling that as a kid, he dreamed of playing music in front of screaming fans. It's hard to imagine his dreams were ever as big as the reality he's living. What inspired this documentary was his promise that when the pandemic ended, he'd throw ""a big party"". That's what led to the E Street Band's reunion for their first tour in six years. We learn bits and pieces of history as it pertains to how the band came together, and though the rehearsal time is short, Bruce explains his goals are to ""shake the dust off the band"" and establish the playlist for the tour. While it's only hinted at a few times, it seems clear that his run on Broadway influenced the vision he had for this tour.Opening night in Tampa is as exciting for the band as it is for the fans. A recurring theme for this film is the crowd shots - often close-ups of fans and their emotional reaction (tears flow freely). We can't help but view this as spiritual for so many - the Church of E Street, if you will. Bruce is crystal clear in his desire to tell a story with the show; a story long-time manager Jon Landau describes as 'living life now'. The show pays tribute to bandmembers lost - Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici, and Bruce's wife and bandmate Patty Scialfa briefly discusses the health scare that has her cautiously participating in shows whenever possible.One of the highlights is the anticipation of the tour arriving in Barcelona. Whatever you've heard about the crowds in Europe, what we witness goes even beyond. These fans remind me so much of those early days as they express their pure appreciation and raw emotion driven by the music. Another aspect that becomes obvious as the tour progresses is that, despite being a huge band on stage, the E Street Band is remarkably talented and incredibly tight musically. This entertainment spectacle is first and foremost a musical gem, and Steve Van Zandt (as Musical Director) probably doesn't receive the recognition he deserves from the fans for his attention to musical details.The segment on the cover of ""Nightshift"" is particularly telling on how things come together for both the music and the stage presentation. It's noted that the song has turned into a 'showstopper' on tour and the film makes it obvious why. Insights from band members throughout the film infer a blended magic with influences of Jazz, R & B, Soul, and Jazz, and the music provides the proof. Piano work from Professor Roy Bittan and sax work from Clarence's nephew Jake cover multiple styles, and when the band cuts loose, rock music has rarely been better. The film leaves us with a bit of uncertainty. Alone on stage with his acoustic guitar, Bruce (now 75 years old) sings ""Last Man Standing"" (noting the recent passing of George Theiss leaves Bruce as the only survivor of his original band, The Castiles). As narrator he refers to ""yesterdays and goodbyes"", and then proclaims he'll continue ""until the wheels come off."" If it's his goodbye, the legacy spans over 50 years. If the wheels stay on, we'll chomp at the bit to see what the Boss brings us next.Premieres on Hulu and Disney+ on October 25, 2024.",2024,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32368703/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. As parents we fool ourselves into believing we know our children and what they are up to. After all, they live in the same house and eat the same meals. Norwegian documentarian Benjamin Ree shows us quite a contrast to this theory. What happens when a loving family discovers their son's secret life much too late?Trude and her husband Robert were thrilled when their son Mats was born in 1989. Shock and disappointment hit hard when Mats was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a rare degenerative muscle disease for which there is no cure. Trude describes the pain of watching her son grow weaker. He had little appetite, became wheelchair bound, and made no real friends. As he got older, the parents refused to limit his computer time, as it was the only thing Mats seemed to want to do.At age 18, Mats started a blog. By age 25 he was dead. His final blog entry was ""Musings of Life"". Since the parents had Mats' password, Robert posted ""The Journey has Come to an End."" The family, including Mats' sister Mia, assumed that was the end of it. What followed was a true blessing (and shock) for the family. Tributes and remembrances of Mats streamed in from the online community. It turns out, Mats was a vital and active member of the Starlight group within the World of Warcraft gaming field. Mats had created a new persona known as Ibelin, and he lived an online life that was impossible for him in the real world.Some of these Starlight folks held a memorial for Mats, which meant so much to the family. We hear directly from some of the folks Mats had helped along the way. He was described as intuitive at helping other lost souls. His dad calculated that Mats had spent approximately 20,000 hours online over the last ten years of his life, and the family was elated that Mats had not led the life of isolation they assumed, and instead thrived behind the Ibelin avatar. This revelation was a true blessing, and it's told beautifully in this documentary.On Netflix beginning October 25, 2024.",2024,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19811010/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. The list of icons known by a single name is relatively short and includes such luminaries as Elvis, Prince, Cher, Bono, Beyonce, and Sting. Immediately recognizable with only her first name, Liza Minnelli also fits right in. Documentarian Bruce David Klein has delivered a tribute to her early years as the daughter of worshipped idol Judy Garland and famed film director Vicente Minnelli, and outlines her own path to stardom after tragedy to being recognized as one of the greatest performers of all time.Liza is now 79 years old and wheelchair bound, and yet when the lights are on and the camera is rolling, her entertainer side takes over and she's charming, and a bit naughty. The death of her mother in 1969 (at age 47) was a distinct turning point in Liza's life. She says she was born and they took a picture - meaning she has spent her entire life in the spotlight ... although she makes it clear she was not born in a red sequin dress.We learn about those who have influenced her career, her life, and her style. Singled out are Kay Thompson as a mentor, Charles Aznavour who taught her performance, Fred Ebb and musical partner John Kander, Broadway legend Michael Feinstein, and famed choreographer Bob Fosse. We also learn of Liza's four marriages and divorces to Peter Allen, Jack Haley Jr, Mark Gero, and David Gest. Though Liza offers no real comment on the marriages, those interviewed are particularly harsh when discussing the late Mr. Gest.Liza's brilliance has resulted in the rare EGOT, with her Emmy and Oscar being won in the same year (""Liza with a Z"", CABARET). Not surprisingly, her outstanding performance as Sally Bowles in CABARET (1972) draws a significant portion of the commentary here, and it's stunning to hear Liza remark, ""I don't think I'm a real good singer, but I can act a song."" Her loyalty to friends is emphasized on multiple occasions - never more dramatically than when she saved the Broadway production of ""Chicago"" by substituting for Gwen Verdon.Not much time is devoted to the dark period, although her friendship with Halston (clothes and parties at Studio 54) is mentioned. Liza's half-sister Lorna Luft appears briefly, but not much personal insight is provided. Rehab for Liza is acknowledged, but let's be clear, Bruce David Klein set out to make a loving tribute to a fascinating performer, and that's exactly what this is.Opens in theaters on March 14, 2025.",2025,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32150684/

classicsoncall,"SpoilerThis is a forceful and important piece of filmmaking to support the cause of 'Never Again'. With the prospect of the Nuremberg Trials scheduled to bring Nazi war criminals to justice in 1945, young military brothers Budd and Stuart Schulberg were tapped by director John Ford to investigate and uncover as much filmed evidence of the German promise to eliminate the Jewish people in territories under their control. Finding themselves in a race against time before all the film footage could be destroyed by the Nazi war machine, the brothers harried to various locations where they had clues as to where such records were stored. After they discovered a vast trove of remarkable film footage, they had to be certain that they used only German film production as proof of war crimes, as the Nuremberg Tribunal insisted that American footage not be used, as it could be open to questions of bias and tampering. Incredibly, German filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was instrumental in identifying the upper echelon members of Hitler's command, whose appearance in some of the retrieved footage documented their heinous deeds in both words and pictures. The Nuremberg Trial lasted two hundred sixteen days with five thousand, three hundred thirty exhibits covering two hundred fifty thousand pages of material, along with twenty-five thousand photos. One hundred thirty-nine witnesses to Nazi war crimes also testified. One would think that the film documentary would have been made immediately available for the world to witness the horrible atrocities shown in the footage, but with the Marshall Plan about to get underway to help a devastated Germany get back on its feet, the idea was scuttled and kept hidden from an international audience. And yet, one can't help but feel that man's inhumanity towards fellow man is alive and deep rooted as ever as evidenced by all the trouble spots in the world today. Why can't we ever learn?",2024,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13836144/

imseeg,"No famous musicians or celebrities are being interviewed. No Jimi Hendrix interviews either, we only get to hear and see the recording engineers who built and ran the studio with several Hendrix outakes of recordings that didnt make it to the album. And what bliss to hear those engineers recollect their memories of the birth of Jimi Hendrix' recording room in Manhattan, New York City.Jimi was always full of ideas which he couldnt immediately translate into work because of the incredibly expensive recording studios which already had costed Jimi a fortune. He didnt like the cold and soulless atmospheres of the usual recording studios either, hence his wish to build one of his own! And so he did!Jimi's input into the design was especially geared towards the lighting, because he wished to be surrounded by a warm atmosphere, hence his wish to have different light colors available for any mood he was into.A really fun and detailed look into how this magical Jimi Hendrix studio came to be. Highly recommended for Jimi Hendrix fans! And now I gonna listen to Electric Ladyland, which still blows my mind to this very day!",2024,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33071166/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Is it possible to be a rock star that no one has heard of? Well, in a way, that's what happened to Marc Bolan. In Great Brittain, Bolan and his band T. Rex drew huge crowds and had a massive fan base, whereas in the United States, they had only a small cult following (which meant very little record sales or radio airtime). Ethan Silverman (he of previous short films and music videos) conceived of this record album/documentary combination, and in 2020 set out to make the project come to life.This may be the only 'making of an album' documentary that doesn't feature a single complete song being recorded. Instead, Silverman treats us to a revolving studio door of musicians who have come to pay tribute to the influential Bolan by recording one of his songs. The lineup includes such artists as U2, Nick Cave, Joan Jett, Beth Orton, Maria McKee, The Orwells, Macy Gray, Snarky Puppy, Lucinda Williams, Kesha, and the multi-talented John Cameron Mitchell. Unfortunately, missing from the action is David Johansen (passed away earlier this year), whose version of ""Bang a Gong"" is an album highlight, and whose band New York Dolls were assuredly influenced by Marc Bolan.What really makes this a gift for us Marc Bolan fans is the stream of archival interviews and concert clips, many of which we've never seen before. Glitter band, glam-rock, or androgyny - however you choose to describe it, there is no denying Marc Bolan was a pioneer. He, along with David Bowie, brought a new look and feel to music ... turning rock concerts into theatrical productions. Bolan and Bowie were colleagues, friends, and rivals and Silverman plays clips of each discussing the complicated relationship and respect the two shared. They set the stage for acts like Alice Cooper, KISS, Queen, Def Leppard, and even R. E. M. It's also mentioned how Bolan's understanding of production led him to take full advantage of color TV, which was then entering mainstream.The concert clips are undeniable proof of Marc Bolan's charisma, showmanship, and talent. The feedback and tributes from other artists make his songwriting excellence clear to the rest of us. We even get a concert clip of young Elton John playing keyboard with T. Rex, and Ringo Starr discussing Bolan's influence on ""Back Off Boogaloo"", Ringo's 1972 hit single. Bolan's partner, singer Gloria Jones, is the mother of his son Rolan. She provides some memories, while Rolan sings backup on some recordings prior to showing us his family photo album. There is a terrific clip of Marc Bolan (as TV host) introducing a hot new band, Generation X featuring Billy Idol, who also contributes his own recollection of Bolan.The 25-song album was produced by Hal Willner, whose career touched so many artists (Marianne Faithful, Lou Reed, Lucinda Williams). Willner passed away in 2022, and he's a steady studio presence throughout the film. A musical highlight here is Nick Cave's moving version of ""Cosmic Dance"", allowing his haunting voice to capture those lyrics. Marc Bolan died in a car crash in 1977 at age 29. The album has been available, and Silverman's documentary is now beginning a rolling theatrical run.A tiered theatrical release begins August 8, 2025, opening in various cities each week through September 13, 2025. It will become available on Digital beginning September 5, 2025.",2025,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19799714/

ma-cortes,"¨Day of the Champion¨ may be the greatest movie ever made. In 1965, Steve McQueen abandoned his attempt to make the definitive Formula 1 movie midway through filming. This is a car racing documentary narrated by David Letterman that Hollywood legend and avid racing fan Steve McQueen started production on in the mid-1960s as his passion project, but never completed. Documentary about the Warner Bros Formula One movie 'Day of the Champion' featuring Steve McQueen; and the race to beat 'Grand Prix' to the big screen. Includes footage of the 1965 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring and Monaco and footage that was made for the movie shot 50 years ago; thought to have been lost forever until its recent accidental discovery.John Sturges and his friend Steve McQuuen attempted to adapt Robert Daily's book 'The Cruel Sport' to make the best racing film in history, hiring the best Formula 1 race car drivers: Jackie Stewart, Sterling, John Withmore. However, at the same time a similar project financed by MGM was born: ¨Grand Prix¨ produced and directed by James Frankenheimer with James Garner, Yves Montand, Antonio Sabato. There was then strong competition between the two projects, the one financed by MGM and the one produced by Warner Bros, ""The Day of the Champion"", which was supposed to be more serious and made by the best car specialists. In order to shoot the film, the best British cameraman John Wilcox was shot for panoramic and anamorphic giant screen. There was therefore a competition to shoot the two films, similar to what would happen years later with the pictures: ¨Dangerous Liaisons-Valmont¨ and ¨Tombstone-Wyatt Earp¨. The latter coproduced by Sturges/McQueen failed and went down the drain, being a complete disappointment for Steve who considered it the purport of his life as an expert driver.There is also a special remembrance of McQueen's career: His first roles were in TV series, such as: West Point, Trackdow, Tales of Wells Fargo. His important first role in ¨Never So Few ¨(1959) was originally going to be played by Sammy Davis Jr, but thanks to Frank Sinatra was to Steve. When MacQueen went to England to shot along with Robert Wagner: ¨Philip Leacock's The War Lover¨ (1962), he spent his time looking for race tracks and practicing with high-speed cars. When he briefly left ¨John Sturges' The Great Escape¨ (1963) during filming, due to the fact that his character did not play as large a part as he would have liked, it was James Garner (his friend and immediate next door neighbor in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California,) who convinced him to return (however, when Steve found out that Garner took the role of Grand Prix, he stopped talking to him.) . Because of the huge success and continuing popularity of the film, it has become his best known role. ¨The Sand Pebbles ¨(1966) was another big hit, when he was in China filming it, he found out that Warner Bros had scrapped ¨The day of the Champion¨, the frustration that this caused him could have increased the severity of the cancer that was still in its early stages. In several films he did most of his own stunts : ¨Le Mans¨, ¨The Getaway¨, ¨Bullitt¨, ¨The great escape¨ with the motorcycle, ¨The Hunter¨ demonstrated McQueen's skill as an expert car driver, these scenes were done without stuntmen and at his own risk.",2025,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12381962/

imseeg,"I only knew Luther Vandross from his many old great hit songs on the radio back in the days, so I am not a diehard fan, but this documentary gave me so many goosebumps and such a good feeling! Really touched by it (and surprised by it as well...)What's most surprising to me was the fact that before he got known as a singer he wrote so many songs for other famous singers who all cherished his songwriting skills AND his background singing performances, like Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin and David Bowie.Famous actor Jamie Fox describes several witty memories of him stealing girls' hearts with playing Luther Vandross songs while courting them, making all the girls melt in his arms!Singers all have their peak and then they mostly fade away from the spotlights, but I never knew what happened to Luther Vandross and this movies story about his downfall is so touching, yet still so sad that I dont wanna tell about it here in this review.I can highly recommend watching this doumentary if you have doubts about being it worth the watch ESPECIALLY if you are not a big fan of his work!What a voice!

ma-cortes,"A fine documentary about the world of bullfighting showing the reality of the bullfight, displayng colorful images and stunning close-ups of the two contenders in rhe ring: the torero and the Bull. It exposes the intimate experience of the bullfighter, his religiosity, and adoration of the Virgin Mary, his sacrifice and path to fame, his rites of dress and suit of lights, along with the assumption of the risk of facing a deadly duel as a personal duty, following a tradition that has been sustained por centuries. In fact, bullfighting, as an art form has already been profusely painted and praised by prestigious artists such as Goya, Picasso, Rafael Alberti, and many others. The director himself -who is not a bullfighting enthusiast- said he wanted to film it seriously and objectively, representing an aesthetic challenge for him. He attempts to accept it as it is, and show it in all its rawness and reality, including the gushing blood, as toro as toreador, and the harshness of the Plaza. According to some bullfighting critics, he is credited for portraying that world as it is, the naked truth.The documentary faithfully portrays the splendid figure of the great bullfighter, Andrés Roca Rey as he faces the bull. His face , his grimaces, his face, as well as bull's bravery with its tirelessness in confronting the opponent in order to gore him. And it definitively shows a certain admiration that develops between bullfighter and beast. According to the director, there was a commmitment of the highest level on the part of the toreador Roca Rey. He states the film has not generated controversy or international rejection and is interesting in its own right as an anthropological document. The movie develops a beauty that emerges intermittently through a violent struggle between a man and a beast, both confronting each other to the death, one with his sword and the other with its sharp horns, a confrontation between animality brutality and human racionality.",2025,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26245982/

classicsoncall,"SpoilerSince the last Tom Papa specials I've seen on Netflix were only from a few years ago, I was surprised to see how much older the comedian looked in this program. I think it may have been the beard stubble. In any event, his humor was till engaging with riffs on his daughters going away to college and leaving him and his wife as empty nesters. He claimed it was hard to be old, but I think he had a pretty good perspective on it. I was surprised when he stated ""I still shoplift"" with no disclaimer coming right after or anywhere else in his routine for that matter. I would hate to think the guy was encouraging petty theft as he heads toward retirement. With just a sprinkling of four-letter words, Papa is a comic who doesn't have to rely on a stream of obscenities a lot of his compatriots in the business resort to. This particular show was similar to 2020's ""You're Doing Great"" and 2022's ""What a Day"", so if you like his routine here, you can catch the others on Netflix as well.",2024,4,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22813018/

dannylee3782,"SpoilerGreat documentary. Perfectly encapsulates another example of undeniable capitalistic greed hurting people. I usually don't find anti-capitalist messages very appealing because historically we don't have a great track record. However, this documentary infuriated me on many different levels. How poor management resulted in hundreds of lives lost. How aiming for short-term gains caused a massive loss in the long term. Ironically, Boeing's stock prices that they cared so much about was never that badly affected by this crisis. It was more affected by Covid. Currently, Boeing's stock prices sit at a quarter of its high. It also angers me that poor management changed a longstanding culture of safety first. A singlehanded blow to decades of reputation. Really sad to see that.I have no complaints about the technical aspects of this documentary. Pacing was great and source material was adequately used. Some people may find the technicality of airplanes a little bit difficult, but I think they dumbed it down pretty well. Would recommend this to anyone that's interested in corporate failure and/or aviation. But I think this is a strong documentary with a well-constructed, resonating message.

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Co-directors Philip Delaquis and Barbara Miller opt against an on-camera Q&A session with the Dalai Lama and instead allow His Holiness (the 14th Dalai Lama) to speak directly to the camera on topics pertinent to what's happening in the 21st century. This approach allows the film and his words to wash over us like a meditative event ... calm and soothing. His words not only guide us on ways to chill out, but also inspire us to pay close attention to the current situation. He opens by stating that ""everyone wants peace and happiness"". While logically, we believe this, yet the actions of some, leave us doubtful. Still, going with that premise, the Dalai Lama proceeds to stress the importance of finding a peaceful mind through deep breathing, compassion, education, and the power of nature. The filmmakers include some amazing archival footage dating back to his childhood and the upheaval in China that led him (and so many others) to be refugees to India, where he remains today at age 90. Obviously, this isn't a 'normal' movie, or even a typical documentary. More than anything it's a reminder ... a recommendation to reset our approach. We are so caught up in what he terms ""busy, busy, busy"" that it causes us stress and concern, leading to unhappiness. He says peace is the way to happiness, which is our purpose in life. By peace, he refers to a peaceful mind as well as a lack of war/conflict (resolved through dialogue) and a caring approach to our planet and environment. What a different world this would be if global leaders took the Dalai Lama's approach of compassion and kindness into their governing of nations.

With only a quick mention of that, Morgan goes on to describe elements of her family life, with particular attention to her overachiever husband - ""I love him, I just don't want to be with him.""
It's all in good fun, as she laments how she gained weight during Covid via Jello salads, while taking swipes against perimenopause and fighting over the thermostat with Hubby Chuck.

They not only have a backstory, but it's almost a magical romance in very ordinary places. He actually filmed a gay love story at disneyland, which they did not approve, and of course, placed a cease and desist order. Nude men in some of his films, (probably not at disney), frolicking, actually kissing, dancing. And sadly, at the end, the two men would have return to the harsh real world full of rules and police.

ma-cortes,"This documentary about the great master of European fantasy and horror cinema offers an immersive exploration of the life and work of the legendary director of ¨Suspiria¨, introducing us to the mind of the Italian genius, and offering us the testimonies of other filmmakers who love his work with key names in current cinema. Dario Argento wrote his most famous films inside hotels, completely isolating himself from external reality and immersing himself in his own nightmares. In the documentary Dario is working on his latest script in a hotel room, revisiting the isolation where he dreamed up his most iconic films, removed from distractions to explore his dark imagination. After many years, advised by his agent, he decides to go back to a hotel to finish his new screenplay and to be interviewed, filmed and followed by a crew that is shooting a film about him. Meanwhile, they are intertwined with opinions from notorious directors, screenwriters, producers, actors and family members, such as: Michele Soavi, Lamberto Bava, Franco Ferrini, Luigi Cozzi, Vittorio Cecchi Gori, Guillermo del Toro, Gaspar Noé, Nicolas Winding Refn, Cristina Marsillach, Asia Argento, Fiore Argento, Floriana Argento and musician Claudio Simonetti who was the main composer and member of the musical band Goblin . Within this structure, a wellness center very far from the distressing places that characterize the cinema of Argento does not feel at ease and has difficulty both in finding the peace necessary to finish the screenplay, and in confiding the his secrets to the crew who are interviewing him. But the demon of cinema, who has never abandoned him, will once again push him to give himself totally.In his beginnings Dario was a prestigious screenwriter in various genres as Spaghetti Western, wartime and thriller, such as: ¨One upon the time in the West¨, ¨Oggi a me... domani a te!¨, ¨Cemetery without crosses¨, ¨Battlee of Commandos¨, ¨Commando¨, ¨Every Man Is My Enemy¨. Dario then created the 'Animal Trilogy', whose film titles were influenced by a magician from Turin. His first important movie was ¨The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"" that became an international hit, despite having continuous discussions with the main star, Tony Musante, who even claimed some authorship of the story. Argento followed up with two more thrillers, ¨The Cat o' Nine Tails¨ (1971), starring Karl Malden and James Franciscus, and ¨Four Flies on Grey Velvet¨(1971) starring Michael Brandon and Mimsy Farmer whose character and aspect bears remarkable resemblance to wife Nocolodi which made her quite angry. These films were backed by his father Salvatore Argento who was the major promoter and producer, who financed all his projects and sometimes limited the highly imaginative and expensive productions that came out of Dario's mind. He then went back to directing so-called ""giallo"" thrillers, starting with ¨Deep Red¨ (1975), a violent mystery-thriller starring David Hemmings that inspired a number of international directors in the thriller-horror genre. His next work was ¨Suspiria¨ (1977), his masterpiece, a surreal horror film about a witch's coven that was inspired by the Gothic fairy tales of the Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Anderson, which he also wrote in collaboration with his girlfriend, screenwriter/actress Daria Nicolodi, who acted in ""Profondo Rosso"" (""Deep Red"") and most of Argento's films from then to the late 1980s. However, due to some vicissitudes, discussions and the little recognition of Nicolodi's authorship, it gave rise to the sad marital separation between her and Dario, which caused him deep sorrow. Argento advanced the unfinished trilogy with ¨Inferno¨ (1980), before returning to the ""giallo"" genre with ¨Tenebrae¨(1982), a sort of gory whodunit, and then with the haunting ¨Phenomena¨ (1985) with a very young actress: Jennifer Connellly.Argento got a big hit in North America, as he temporarily settled in the US, where he collaborated with director George A. Romero on the two-part horror-thriller ¨Two Evil Eyes¨ (1990) (he had previously collaborated with Romero on the horror action thriller ¨Dawn of the Dead¨ (1978)). While still living in America, Argento appeared in small roles in several films and directed another violent mystery thriller, ¨Trauma¨ (1993), which starred his youngest daughter Asia Argento from his long-term relationship with Nicolodi. Argento returned to Italy in 1995, where he made a comeback in the horror genre with ¨The Stendhal Syndrome¨ (1996) and then with another version of ""Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera"",¨ The Phantom of the Opera¨ (1998), both of which starred Asia, in this last film she had her first on-screen love scene in front of her father, and where Asia said she lost her virginity. Most recently, Argento directed a number of ""giallo"" mystery thrillers such as: ¨Sleepless¨ (2001), ¨The Card Player¨ (2003) and ¨Do You Like Hitchcock?¨ (2005), as well as two gory, supernatural-themed episodes of the USA TV cable anthology series ¨Masters of Horror¨ (2005). Having always wanted to make a third chapter to his ""Three Mothers"" horror films, Argento finally completed the trilogy in 2007 with the release of ¨Mother of Tears¨ (2007), which starred Asia Argento as a young woman trying to identify and stop the last surviving evil witch from taking over the world. In addition to his Gothic and violent style of storytelling, ""La terza madre"" has many references to two of his previous films, ""Suspiria"" (1997) and ""Inferno"" (1980), which is a must for fans of the trilogy.The documentary titled¨ Dario Argento: Panico¨(2023) was well directed by Simone Scafidi who, together with his production team, documents his life, including formative interviews and illustrating us extensively about Dario's career. Simone is a director and screenwriter specialized in the world of documentary. Among his works are: ¨Zanetti story¨ (2015) and ¨Fulci for Fake¨ (2019).",2024,1,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27728888/

ShadowsBeneathTheLight,"The documentary is a great example of cops giving zero shoots when a male reports a crime. There are plenty of times they could've intervened, tried to track down the stalker, issued police protection to those being stalked/harassed, have a squad car outside, do literally anything. Instead for weeks, months and even years they just threw their hands in their saying ""nothing we can do but call us back if something happens again."" I think documentary does a decent job explaining Dave's story and everything he went through as well as how this affect everyone in his life. Where the documentary falls apart is during the final 20 minutes. They try to paint the cops as the victim in all of this. ""This case took a toll on personal life, it affected my marriage my health blah blah blah. Had y'all done your job from the start, maybe this case could've been easier to solve, and there certainly would be a lot less victims/crimes had the stalker been caught earlier. Worse is the evidence they bring forth for the final murder is really really shoddy. They arrest a woman for a murder of a woman that they aren't actually sure is dead, there's no body, no weapon, no DNA, just one lone finger print on an mint can. I'm sorry but this conviction will be very hard for many to stomach. I wish they presented either more evidence or arguments from the trial so we could at least buy the conviction. Instead the trial is glossed over in about 2 minutes. They go to court and then cut to the verdict. In the end I honestly don't know what to believe other than it seems the cops failed everyone involved in the case except themselves and the prosecution. Great premise, great twist, but please give us more evidence, especially at a time where trust in law enforcement is at an all time low.",2024,6,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30852970/
classicsoncall,"SpoilerWell, this film ought to put a handful of conspiracy theories to bed and give rise to a host of others. Personally, I could never buy the single 'magic' bullet thesis set forth by the Warren Commission. All it takes is a boatload of common sense to question the path of that bullet when you see a diagram of the course it had to take to inflict damage on President Kennedy and Governor John Connally. It would also be disingenuous to try and discredit the handful of medical personnel who were on hand in Trauma Room One of the Parkland Memorial Hospital on the tragic day John F. Kennedy was assassinated. All of them, interviewed for this documentary, are of a single mind as to what they saw when they examined the body of the President, most notably the throat and back of his head. The forces that went into play to thwart an onsite autopsy of the President, along with the quickly orchestrated removal of the corpse to Washington, D. C., ought to leave one with many questions about the motives of the government that pretty much exist to this day. To my mind, what is the concern with knowing the actual truth of what happened on November 22nd, 1963 that would expose some massive government secret? After seeing this documentary, you may well come to the conclusion that fake news existed a long time before the present day.",2023,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29702876/

boblipton,"This movie turned out to be, as you might suspect, a two-hour lecture by Martin Scorsese on Powell and Pressberger, with supporting documents and clips. To be slightly more precise, it's about Scorsese, his reaction to the films of the two men, and how he knew Powell for the last decade and a half of his life. It's a pretty good lecture on the films. If you're not familiar with them, you'll have a good overview of their movies, and what to look for.If you are very familiar with them, there won't be much new. I'm glad their works have returned to prominence, and their abilities are recognized. Not because of Art or Fairness, but because the better of them satisfy my three basic criteria for good movies: they tell a story well, they're immensely entertaining, and they have something to say about the human condition. But I am confronted with the question: if they weren't already important to you, would you even look at this film?",2024,5,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19895822/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Is it possible to be a rock star that no one has heard of? Well, in a way, that's what happened to Marc Bolan. In Great Brittain, Bolan and his band T. Rex drew huge crowds and had a massive fan base, whereas in the United States, they had only a small cult following (which meant very little record sales or radio airtime). Ethan Silverman (he of previous short films and music videos) conceived of this record album/documentary combination, and in 2020 set out to make the project come to life.This may be the only 'making of an album' documentary that doesn't feature a single complete song being recorded. Instead, Silverman treats us to a revolving studio door of musicians who have come to pay tribute to the influential Bolan by recording one of his songs. The lineup includes such artists as U2, Nick Cave, Joan Jett, Beth Orton, Maria McKee, The Orwells, Macy Gray, Snarky Puppy, Lucinda Williams, Kesha, and the multi-talented John Cameron Mitchell. Unfortunately, missing from the action is David Johansen (passed away earlier this year), whose version of ""Bang a Gong"" is an album highlight, and whose band New York Dolls were assuredly influenced by Marc Bolan.What really makes this a gift for us Marc Bolan fans is the stream of archival interviews and concert clips, many of which we've never seen before. Glitter band, glam-rock, or androgyny - however you choose to describe it, there is no denying Marc Bolan was a pioneer. He, along with David Bowie, brought a new look and feel to music ... turning rock concerts into theatrical productions. Bolan and Bowie were colleagues, friends, and rivals and Silverman plays clips of each discussing the complicated relationship and respect the two shared. They set the stage for acts like Alice Cooper, KISS, Queen, Def Leppard, and even R. E. M. It's also mentioned how Bolan's understanding of production led him to take full advantage of color TV, which was then entering mainstream.The concert clips are undeniable proof of Marc Bolan's charisma, showmanship, and talent. The feedback and tributes from other artists make his songwriting excellence clear to the rest of us. We even get a concert clip of young Elton John playing keyboard with T. Rex, and Ringo Starr discussing Bolan's influence on ""Back Off Boogaloo"", Ringo's 1972 hit single. Bolan's partner, singer Gloria Jones, is the mother of his son Rolan. She provides some memories, while Rolan sings backup on some recordings prior to showing us his family photo album. There is a terrific clip of Marc Bolan (as TV host) introducing a hot new band, Generation X featuring Billy Idol, who also contributes his own recollection of Bolan.The 25-song album was produced by Hal Willner, whose career touched so many artists (Marianne Faithful, Lou Reed, Lucinda Williams). Willner passed away in 2022, and he's a steady studio presence throughout the film. A musical highlight here is Nick Cave's moving version of ""Cosmic Dance"", allowing his haunting voice to capture those lyrics. Marc Bolan died in a car crash in 1977 at age 29. The album has been available, and Silverman's documentary is now beginning a rolling theatrical run.A tiered theatrical release begins August 8, 2025, opening in various cities each week through September 13, 2025. It will become available on Digital beginning September 5, 2025.",2025,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19799714/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. In 2022, Kathryn Ferguson released a documentary on singer and activist Sinead O'Connor. It was Ms. Ferguson's first feature-length documentary, after a few shorts and videos. This time out, her focus is on renowned actor Humphrey Bogart. Now, opening on your subject's funeral might be an unusual way to begin a profile, but the star-studded service drives home the point that Bogart's life touched many. He was true Hollywood royalty.One would expect the profile of one of the biggest movie stars of all time to provide a chronological rundown of his films. Although his film resume is certainly not short-changed, the director takes a more personal approach by structuring Bogie's life according to how the five most influential women impacted him. Those five are: his mother, Maud Humphrey, and his four wives (in order), Helen Menken, Mary Philips, Mayo Methot, and of course, Lauren Bacall. We are guided through each of these relationships, with neither good nor bad being withheld.Much of the time is spent with narrator Kerry Shale reciting Bogart's own words from writings, journals, letters, etc. Shale offers neither a mimic of Bogie's distinctive voice nor a smooth sound for our ears. Still, there is heft and meaning to Bogart's words, especially when they are synchronized with an incredible bounty of archival footage, film clips, and photographs. Numerous interviews are included from son Stephen Bogart, directors Howard Hawks and John Huston, and actress Kathryn Hepburn, as well as others. There is also plenty from Lauren Bacall, who famously met Bogart when she was a 19-year-old actress on the set of TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT (1944). The two were married from 1945 through 1957 (his death). It was a true love story, and not nearly as tumultuous as his time with third wife Mayo Methot, who shot at him and stabbed him!There is a segment on Bogie's first career - a baby model - and his own words describe this relationship with his mother as he looks back at his childhood. We hear about his time in the Navy, as well as his love of chess and the water ... especially time spent sailing on his boat, Santana. We also hear about his quick temper and his alcoholism, and it's fascinating to learn that it was actress Greer Garson who heard his cough and insisted that he see a doctor - a visit that resulted in a cancer diagnosis.After years as a contract player in the studio system, it was HIGH SIERRA (1940) that set him on the road to superstardom. Bogart's career included such iconic roles as Sam Spade (THE MALTESE FALCON, 1941), Rick Blaine (CASABLANCA, 1943), Philip Marlowe (THE BIG SLEEP, 1946), and Lt Commander Queeg (THE CAINE MUTINY, 1954). One of my personal favorites was his role as Dixon Steele in Nicholas Ray's IN A LONELY PLACE (1950) with Gloria Grahame. When they hear the name Humphrey Bogart, many movie fans picture the trench coat, hat, and cigarette ... or the broken love story that begins a friendship. But there was much more behind the scenes. After directing Bogie to his only Oscar in THE AFRICAN QUEEN (1951), director John Huston delivered the eulogy at the funeral for his friend, also putting the final touches on this in-depth profile.Opens in select theaters on November 15, 2024.",2024,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32736393/

ShadowsBeneathTheLight,"I'm surprised to see this so poorly rated. I am a big fan of Kevin James and thought it was funny. Unlike a lot of ""modern"" comedians, Kevin Doesnt bother being political or telling ""safe"" jokes. He's never offensive either, but he calls out easy current generations have it and how soft our society has become. Kevin is older now with kids, so naturally his comedy reflects this. Kevin has also lost a lot of weight from his The King Of Queens days, and it's great to see him branching out from of his food and fatty comedy now that he takes care of himself. My only gripe is he spends the last chunk of his comedy talking about the wife, and while not offensive or anything, it just drags on a bit much that it's no longer funny.",2024,4,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29964571/

It's how we die which frightens us all, or a long painful end to our lives can be worse.What frightens me personally is not my death but losing all who mean everything to me, to be the last of my family my age group in friends. To be lonely without one who loves me and who I love. What would be the point of extending life. This man is rich.

boblipton,"Joe Caroff is going to turn 102 in a month or two, but that's not why he got a documentary about him. Caroff designs images: the striking red and black poster for WEST SIDE STORY, the '007' that becomes a gun for the franchise, the skyscraper typeface for Woody Allen's MANHATTAN, and many, many more.In contrast to the auteur theory of cinema, I have long insisted it is an intensively collaborative medium. This documentary casts light on a small but important corner of it: the fellow who designs the posters and logos and such, whose work gives you your very first impression of what you will spend money for. By offering a series of them, you can gain an idea of the importance of the man's work.All that is good, but that's the the limit of the excellence of this movie. Like an old-time Tin Pan Alley composer on tour, saying ""And then I wrote...."" and playing the next tune, Caroff has some brief, unilluminating thoughts on the subject, and then goes on to the next bit of design. He's a a guy I want to know more about, how his mind works, how he comes up with these ideas, how I can do it too. In the end, like a SF writer asked where he gets his ideas from, and replying ""Schenectady"", Caroff's response is ""the subconscious.""",2023,5,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23318932/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Fourteen years spent teaching advanced degree architectural students at Columbia led to her being denied tenure, so Ada Karmi-Melamede did what any self-respecting and incredibly talented architect would do ... she quit the job and bet on herself. It's a bet that has resulted in numerous high-profile projects in her homeland, Israel.Ada's story would likely remain an untold secret if not for her daughter, Yael Melamede. Yael directs the film, but more importantly, masterfully directs her mother Ada into opening up about her life and career. It's not an easy path for either woman, as Ada left her family to pursue her own career and passion for architecture, a step much more common for fathers than mothers.To quell any doubts as to whether this is just a family member attempting to create publicity, or whether Ada's work is deserving of such a tribute, one need only view some of her most famous projects: the Supreme Court of Israel, the Ben Gurion Airport, and the Open University of Israel. And beyond that are her contributions to New York: a master plan for Con Edison and a housing competition on Roosevelt Island. Should you need more, we see accolades from famed architects Frank Gehry, Keith Frampton, and Mose Sofdie. Despite her lack of widespread acclaim, Ada Karmi-Melamede is truly one of the most accomplished architects in the world.Adding intrigue, this documentary is not just about a talented architect. There is also the personal element which finds a grown woman striving to find connection with her mother ... a mother who admittedly didn't possess typical motherly attributes. One is a woman who longs to know more, while the other is a woman who tends to balk at saying much about herself, her life, or her reasons. Seeing the defensiveness fade away is quite something, and a tribute to daughter Yael for encouraging the connection. We learn much about her childhood, the family, the influences, and the life each had without the other.Ada is most comfortable talking about her profession. Her pencil versus computer segment strikes a chord, and when she reacts to a tour guide's description of her work, the moment is priceless. We begin to understand her passion when she discusses the Parthenon, and the shots of her own projects leave no doubt as to her influence. Ada's feelings on current Israeli politics are crystal clear, and the segment on ""Time"" provides a life lesson for everyone.Opens in NYC on May 9, 2025, and in LA on May 15, 2025.",2025,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26915722/

lovecedu-647-415631,"The reviews very nearly put me off watching this. No one wants to watch some entitled guy telling everyone what to think or feel. And that's what the reviews made me thing this would be.After the usual battle of searching for a film with enough decent reviews and plot, I eventually went full circle, came back to this film and took the chance.I don't know who this guy is tbh. But he has some good insights if one is open enough to listen. I learnt some things watching this and I enjoy a good grounding experience every now and then.The world is a hectic place and it's always nice to have the time to reconnect with the bigger picture.The stories were pretty amazing to think about I wish there were more of them.Glad I took the risk and watched this. I'd defo recomend.The pacing is good, the story telling is good and the guy is pretty likeable all things considered. Just a dude doing his best like we all are.Good for him for having made a success of himself through his book and now through a film. Pretty cool.If you've got a curious mind and you're trying to find something gripping to watch I'd recommend this film/story telling documentary. Defo doesn't feel like a waste of time, it's an enjoyable watch.",2023,4,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12380422/

ma-cortes,"This documentary premiered at the last edition of the Venice Film Festival and introduces us to Hayao Miyazaki like never before. Hayao, founder of Studio Ghibli, has been transporting us to unique universes with his films for over 50 years. My Neighbor Tororo, Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke are the top ten of his films, which have already become cult classics. Thanks to privileged access to his work and interviews with his son, director Goro Miyazaki, and with Toshio Suzuki, producer and friend of Hayao, we discover the life, cinema and influences of the director. In fact, In 2014, Miyazaki was awarded an Honorary Academy Award for his impact on animation and cinema.Miyazaki's early work was as a mangaka, when Hayao first saw the film The Panda and the Magic Serpent, he made the decision to dedicate himself to film animation. His first film was Panda and Friends, made with his usual collaborator Takahata. And he worked for the powerful Toei film company , working in Horus: Prince of the Sun (1968), a precursor to the ' Shónen style' in anime (Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto), its then revolutionary ideas were copied and perfected to the point of exhaustion in the most popular series and films of the genre. Surrounded by a young and ambitious team led by the then unknown and newcomer Hayao Miyazaki, he provided the set design and ideological support for much of this film. But this was a time of student revolt and strikes and director Takahata and Miyazaki (future founders of Studio Ghibli who met here for the first time) were idealists with left-wing convictions at the time. This caused a strong clash with Toei, since the working conditions were precarious and exhausting. His next film was ¨The Castle of Cagliostro¨, which was a commercial failure, however today it is a highly revered film and a cult film. Due to the previous failure, Hayao became a mangaka again, drawing the manga series, Nausicaa. Due to its success, he continued with the film adaptation: Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984). He founded Ghibli Studios with his partner, friend and long-time collaborator Takahata. Since then, he has since directed, written, and produced many other films with Isao Takahata. More recently, he has produced with Toshio Suzuki. All enjoyed critical and box office success, in particular Princess Mononoke (1997). It received the Japanese equivalent of the Academy Award for Best Film and was the highest-grossing (about USD $150 million) domestic film in Japan's history at the time of its release.In addition to animation, he also draws manga. His major work was Nausicaä, an epic tale he worked on intermittently from 1982 to 1984 while he was busy making animated films. Another manga Hikotei Jidai, later evolved into Porco Rosso (1992). Other important animes were : Castle in the Sky (1986), Ponyo (2008) , Tales from Earthsea (2006) along with his son Goro Miyazaki, and, of course, his masterpiece Spirited away (2001).The documentary is very instructive, thanks to it we learn the main keys to Hayao's work: his interest in the environment, ecology, natural and man-made disasters, environment, climate change, Japanese religion as Shintoism, Animism , spiritual beings like the Camy, etc. He was born during the Second World War, and suffered the consequences as a child, being very worried due to his mother's tuberculosis. We learn of his interest in aviation because his relatives worked in aircraft manufacturing, especially he loved the iconic plane in his films, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, which operated in WWII. As well as his fondness for vegetation and trees such as the camphor tree, especially the one located in Nagoya.",2024,1,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33030449/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Being the creative force behind what many consider to be the best TV show of all time - one that changed the face of television - is both a blessing and a burden. David Chase is that man, and his often dour disposition hides the creative genius behind ""The Sopranos"" (1999-2007). Oscar winning documentarian Alex Gibney (TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE, 2007; ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM, 2005) re-creates Dr. Melphi's office for his sit down with Chase, and it's a smooth move to encourage Chase to open up in the same setting where his creation, Tony Soprano, often let his guard down. This is not really meant as an introduction to garner new fans for reruns, but rather as a tribute to David Chase and a peek behind the curtain for hardcore fans.Don't worry ... it's not three hours of two guys talking. Gibney complements Chase's insight with a treasure trove of clips and interviews and background details, really serving up a deep dive for those who considered this show to be must-see TV. Chase actually quotes one of the best lines from the series when he says, ""'Remember when' is the lowest form of conversation"". By the end of the first (of two) part, many will be amazed at just how much of the show was inspired by David Chase's actual life and large Italian family. You might also be amazed at how fragile the environment can be for even the most successful of TV shows.Chase lets us in on some personal details, and nothing is more personal than his proclamation, ""My mother was nuts."" Fans will eat up the segment on Nancy Marchand, the veteran actor who played Livia, Tony's mother. Chase said Ms. Marchand just ""had it"" (what he wanted for the character based on his own mother). It's also interesting to learn that Chase's early career aspirations were for movies, not television. In fact, he envisioned this as a movie starring Robert DeNiro and Anne Bancroft. Of course, no one would back him, and when he converted it to a series, none of the networks had an interest either. It took upstart HBO, who at the time was only beginning the transition from Movies and Sports to series. The reception of ""Oz"" (1997) and ""Sex and the City"" (1998) set the table for HBO to give the green light to the risky venture that itself eventually set the table for shows such as ""Breaking Bad"".The conversation between Gibney and Chase is interspliced with clips from the show, as well as family video and pictures. Chase walks us through how the main characters were cast, and it's fascinating to watch the rough cuts of auditions - some who made it, and some who didn't (including former Cornell star RB and ""Hill Street Blues"" actor Ed Marinaro). This gives us a true behind-the-scenes glimpse at how things came together. We also hear from some of the show's writers who explain just how stressful things could get in the writers' room, even though HBO gave them significant creative control.There are segments featuring Michael Imperioli, Steve VanZandt, Lorraine Bracco, Tony Sirico, and Drea de Matteo. Perhaps the most enjoyable is watching Edie Falco (who was the last one cast in the principal cast) as she explains there were no ""trigger warnings"" for the show. She states it was just like real life, complete with racism, sexism, misogyny, and violence. It's hilarious hearing how sensitive Sirico was about his hair, and Drea walks us through her character's ending - just after Lorraine Bracco explains what happens when David Chase invites you to dinner.There are clips of the infamous ""ducks"" from the pilot, and Chase comments on the critical raves that immediately rolled in - plus the pressures of additional seasons. Writer-Producer Terrence Winter joined the show in the second season, and he's interviewed here. Winter has since gone on to write and/or produce projects such as ""Boardwalk Empire"" and THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), the latter of which got him an Oscar nomination.The deaths of Nancy Marchand and series star James Gandolfini are handled with grace, including a clip of an emotional Chase speaking at Gandolfini's funeral. We hear about the toll playing Tony took on Gandolfini, and how some of the cast were there for him in times of darkness and need. Gandolfini died in 2013 at age 51 from a heart attack. It's interesting to learn that Chase only directed two episodes himself - the first and the last. And speaking of the finale, we see clips of Holsten's and hear ""Don't Stop Believin"" while reliving how that finale shocked viewers and generated so much discussion. Chase addresses this by saying, ""The truth is ...""

ksf-2,"Really interesting documentary. Canadian filmmaker pat rocco finds his way to hollywood.... starts out making softcore films. In harvey milk's orbit, he's in the right place to document police activity at the club ""the meat market"". Later making softcore films with a gay, romantic story. They not only have a backstory, but it's almost a magical romance in very ordinary places. He actually filmed a gay love story at disneyland, which they did not approve, and of course, placed a cease and desist order. Nude men in some of his films, (probably not at disney), frolicking, actually kissing, dancing. And sadly, at the end, the two men would have return to the harsh real world full of rules and police. Includes interviews with rocco, his partner, by charlie david, a director and actor in his own right. Very well done! It was fun learning about a guy that most of us had probably never heard of. He not only filmed gay parades and events, but had a hand in organizing them. And has become part of history himself.",2025,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6587220/

classicsoncall,"SpoilerWell, this film ought to put a handful of conspiracy theories to bed and give rise to a host of others. Personally, I could never buy the single 'magic' bullet thesis set forth by the Warren Commission. All it takes is a boatload of common sense to question the path of that bullet when you see a diagram of the course it had to take to inflict damage on President Kennedy and Governor John Connally. It would also be disingenuous to try and discredit the handful of medical personnel who were on hand in Trauma Room One of the Parkland Memorial Hospital on the tragic day John F. Kennedy was assassinated. All of them, interviewed for this documentary, are of a single mind as to what they saw when they examined the body of the President, most notably the throat and back of his head. The forces that went into play to thwart an onsite autopsy of the President, along with the quickly orchestrated removal of the corpse to Washington, D. C., ought to leave one with many questions about the motives of the government that pretty much exist to this day. To my mind, what is the concern with knowing the actual truth of what happened on November 22nd, 1963 that would expose some massive government secret? After seeing this documentary, you may well come to the conclusion that fake news existed a long time before the present day.",2023,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29702876/

paul_m_haakonsen,"When I stumbled upon this this 2024 Netflix stand-up comedy show, I had never even heard about Matt Rife. And thus, since I had no idea who he was or how funny he hopefully was, then I opted to watch the show and give it a fair chance. Much can be said for the contents of the show, as I assume a lot of people will not overly enjoy the interaction between the comedian and the audience, but it does require some quick thinking and the ability to twist even the most serious of subjects to something funny. If nothing else, then it was certainly a different way to deliver a comedy show. I did enjoy the interaction with the crowd, though it was something that I think would grow stale quickly if done again and again in each new show. Matt Rife does feel naturally at home on the stage in front of the audience, and he was good at including the audience. Well, duh, since it was the core essence of this particular show. But I feel that he handled himself well on the stage. I was adequately entertained throughout the course of the 54 minutes that the show ran for. However, ""Matt Rife: Lucid - A Crowd Work Special"" is hardly a show that warrants more than a single viewing. My rating of ""Matt Rife: Lucid - A Crowd Work Special"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",2025,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32986357/
stevendbeard,"SpoilerI saw One to One: John & Yoko, starring John Lennon & Yoko Ono.This is a documentary that is partially about politics and partially a concert film. It starts in 1972 New York when John & Yoko came to live in America. The main reason for the move from England was for Yoko to find her estranged daughter. This film includes home movies, restored footage and unseen archives covering the 18 month time period that John & Yoko were living in Greenwich Village. After seeing a Geraldo Rivera report on tv about Willowbrook State School in Staten Island, New York where they were mistreating their special needs children, John decided to put on the only full length concert he ever performed, since leaving the Beatles. It was called One to One and he used the Plastic Ono Band with Elephant's Memory. The concert parts are interspersed with actual people and events that were also going on at the time, and you see people like Shirley Chishelm, Jerry Rubin, Allen Ginsberg, George Wallace, Andy Warhol, Stevie Wonder and President Richard Nixon. The concert parts of the film are good but I didn't care too much for the politics part. I grew up in the 60's and know about the riots, inequality for gays and women and the Vietnam war issues.It's rated R for violence, drug use, language and nudity and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.Like I said, the concert part is good but I didn't care for the politics.

imseeg,"This documentary clocks at 4 and a half hours, of which the first 2 hours are about the absolute birth of computer shooter games (Wolfenstein, DOOM and Quake) and the second 2 hours are about the more recently released widely popular games like Halo etc.I was confronted with Wolfenstein in the early eighties and I had a fun blast. But a few years later I underwent ""DOOM"" and that really blew my mind! And I still think DOOM is one of the best shooter games ever made! It's simplicity, combined with ultimate shock effects, still freak me out some 30 years later. What a thrill ride!Especially the really early development of 3D visuals on the computer (back in the late seventies) is fun to watch. The guys who invented all these wonderful programs are being interviewed and what achievements they have made for the world of computer gaming.Nice watch, although quite long, but one can choose what to watch. Interesting insights into this massive virtual world which is the biggest grossing part of the entertainment industry nowadays. Lots of reviews by the makers themselves of all the most popular shooter games. What's not to like?",2023,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28681130/

boblipton,"For those of you who are unaware, Leonard Cohen was a Jewish Canadian mystic poet. His concern was the apparent conflict between the sacred and the profane. One day he realized what he was writing might actually be songs, and so began a concert and recording career. The song in the title ""Hallelujah"" was a track on an album which his company refused to release -- in my opinion, Cohen's mixture of the sacred and the earthy in this song likely offended the equally Jewish head of the company so much it was not released in the US. Nonetheless, the song caught on over the decades.As a Jew, I find nothing surprising in this. As Cohen notes in one of the later interviews included herein, Judaism makes you want to raise your fist and to shout hallelujah. To Christians, who believe in a benevolent G*d, this seems to be confusing; however Jews recognize that the world is G*d's creation just as much as the Torah. Which is why there are more than a hundred verses in Cohen's notebooks, with subjects ranging from angels to bondage.Cohen wrote some other excellent songs, too.",2022,4,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7600742/

boblipton,"This movie purports to tell the story of Jack Warner, whose name was emblazoned across hundreds of movies in the studio era as ""Executive In Charge Of Production."" It's written and directed by Gregory Orr, the son of Warner's step-daughter, and that is its weakness: it's full of family legend, with the facts of secondary interest.Even then, those facts are poorly presented, with focus shifting from the premiere of THE JAZZ SINGER to discussion of whether Joan Blondell should wear a brassiere in 1933 without hesitation. Wrong dates abound, and other studios' are ignored in efforts to bolster Warners' excellence; Warners' CONFESSIONS OF A NAZI SPY was not the first anti-fascist picture produced in Hollywood. The first Mrs. Warner is almost unmentioned, and the stress with Jack Warner Jr. Is laid at the younger man's feet.There's a worthwhile story to be told about Jack Warner, covering not only his family, but the the management of the studio and stresses of the business aspects of it. Unfortunately, this is not it.",2023,7,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27212119/

It covers Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers around 1982 and 1983, with some lost footage added to it, mostly donated by Tom's daughter, Adria and she appears in the film, talking to Cameron. The original documentary only appeared once on MTV and has some MTV footage added to it, too. It contains songs from many different concerts and shows the group waiting to see how their newest album, Long After Dark is received by the public. All through the film, you see Tom's sense of humor on display and that the group is more like a family than just a rock band.It's rated NR but it contains footage of smoking and has a running time of 1 hour & 24 minutes.I'm not a big fan-I like some of his songs-but if you are a fan, you should enjoy it more than I did.

It's just a group of young actors (who are all quite good) work shopping the play scene by scene, but this was done after the Broadway production. I supposed this might be of interest to acting students but it really tells us nothing about the controversies of the original staging. I saw a couple positive reviews that read like we probably saw 2 completely different films.What is DOES seem to be is a huge ego-stroker for the writer/director.

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. So why did John and Yoko leave England to live in New York? This film provides the answer. Where did they choose to live? The film provides the answer. Why did John perform his only full post-Beatles concert in 1972? This film provides the answer. Why did they become so politically and socially active during those first 18 months in the States? This film provides the answer. And if you ever wondered how John felt about American television, well you guessed it ... this film provides the answer.Where did all of these answers come from? Well, Oscar winner Kevin Macdonald (ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER, 1999; THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND, 2006; MARLEY, 2012) co-directs with Editor/co-director Sam Rice-Edwards and they focus on a very brief timeline, so that we might better understand John Lennon and Yoko Ono. You might think you know all you need to know about this famous couple, but the filmmakers, along with Producer Sean Ono Lennon, ensure that you see and hear clips you haven't seen or heard before.Much of this is centered around John's only full post-Beatles concert in 1972, entitled ""One to One"". Its purpose was to raise funds for kids through Willowbrook State School. And that's not the only storyline about a kid - it turns out, one of the reasons John and Yoko moved to the states was her hope in reuniting with a long-lost daughter named Kyoto. It's just one of the elements of the film that makes this much more of a personal story than simply a recap of celebrities.The film also works as a snapshot of the era. President Richard Nixon (one clip shows him sporting a maroon blazer), extremist Jerry Rubin, ""The Mike Douglas Show"", Dick Cavett, Attica, Andy Warhol, and Billy Graham all have their moments. The attempted assassination of George Wallace is shown, as are numerous TV ads, TV series clips, and some news reports. The Vietnam War and Watergate are featured, yet somehow Allen Ginsburg reciting an ode to wiping one's rear-end nearly steals the show.We've all seen clips from Lennon's One to One concert, and here they are remastered and sound terrific. ""Instant Karma"", ""Hound Dog"", ""Cold Turkey"", ""Imagine"", ""Give Peace a Chance"" are all shown, but it's the scorching version of ""Come Together"" that really stands out. Of course, we are subjected to Yoko's onstage banshee screeching ... though thankfully near the end of the film, she gets a more heartfelt chance to actually sing.During the film, the contrast with Nixon is obvious. John and Yoko are sincerely committed to peace, love, and justice, while Nixon's politics for power stands opposed. The recreation of John and Yoko's small apartment in the Village is quite something to behold - and remarkable when compared to the photographs and archival footage. When John describes his early obsession with TV as 'a window into the world' and a replacement for the fireplace of his youth, we gain even more insight into the man known mostly for his music and quips. In 1973, John and Yoko moved from the small apartment in the Village to the swanky Dakota building. His wish for the couple to be remembered as ""two lovers"" comes closer to reality with this film. Some of their home movies (with Sean) are played as the runtime ends.In IMAX theaters on April 11, 2025.",2025,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33029955/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Having one's name or work associated Hitler typically (but somehow not always these days) marks one as a pariah or persona non grata. For artists, the rules can be a bit blurred, and filmmaker Andres Veiel takes on the story of Leni Riefenstahl, in hopes of removing some of the blur. Leni Riefenstahl was a former actress who became the Reich's preeminent filmmaker best known as the director of TRIUMPH OF THE WILL (1935), the ultimate propaganda film for the Nazi party, and OLYMPIA (1938), her version of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Having access to her private family archives, filmmaker Veiel takes the deepest dive yet into her life and approach. He opens with her appearance on a 1978 talk show where she is asked if she now considers her association with Hitler to have been a mistake. She bows her head and the clip is cut before we hear the answer (if there was one), though the remainder of the documentary uses her own words and actions to pretty much answer the question. There have been other films about Leni. The most well-known is probably Ray Muller's THE WONDERFUL, HORRIBLE LIFE OF LENI RIEFENSTAHL (1993), which Veiel references here. Still, nothing previous feeds us the wealth of photos and video clips served up by Veiel, offering such a full profile of one of the most controversial people from the WWII era. It should be noted that Leni died in 2003 at age 101, so she lived many decades of facing scrutiny and scorn. During her interviews and appearances on talk shows, very little attention was paid to the innovative filmmaking techniques she used in her work, but rather the attention was on her affiliation with Nazis, especially her 'friendly' relationship with Hitler. Photos of her with Hitler and Goebbels are shown, and the backlash from Goebbels' diaries are discussed. There is also a segment on Albert Speer, part of Hitler's inner circle and one of the war criminals sentenced at the Nuremburg trials. What we notice is that Leni was no wallflower. She often spoke her mind, and continued to hang her hat on the ""art"" label ... going so far as to state (in 1980) that 'art is the opposite of politics.' This defense likely eased her conscience a bit, but we can't help but be stunned when she claims ""Peace"" was the theme of her TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. It's a word that only she would associate with that film. In her defense, Leni states that most Germans supported the efforts and that things didn't end well for dissidents of the Reich. Mostly we find Leni in the George Costanza corner - 'it's not a lie if you believe it.' She was a smart and talented and strong woman who was calculating in everything she did or said. She discusses her long relationship (business and personal) with Horst Kettner, and we see the lovely home they shared. We also learn that it took Leni ten years to write her memoirs, and we are left wondering how much guilt she experienced - despite claiming that she knew nothing of the Holocaust (a topic Veiel addresses). We have all seen her extraordinary camera work on Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics, yet no amount of filmmaking genius or creativity can overshadow her work for Hitler. Was she the first 'cancelled' artist? In fact, regardless of the pain, she must be remembered ... something this project from Andres Veiel ensures. IN THEATERS

tmccheyne,"Could emphasise so much in respect of how able bodied people view us disabled people. I cannot state that my disability is the same, again we are all unique and there is no norm. I had polio when I was three years of age, I do remember some fleeting moments of that time believe it or not. I was totally struck down to begin with, but within a period of time only my left leg was affected...making it shorter and little to no muscle. Eventually I wore steel calipars on my affected leg. Surgery intervention to fix foot and ankle.I met with the bullying, name calling and not belonging as she did. Unfortunately being one of 4 and having problems at home I was sent to an ""open air school"" for most of my childhood.I like the one girl thought I'd be ""normal"" when I was an adult.I too had the strange weirdo men very attracted to me and with their attitude that I should be grateful, but having met and knowing that I was able to distinguish the ones who genuinely liked me for me.One thing as you mature you find that you can love who you are and realise that being different is great.I'm now in my 70s and have had a good life, worked all my years, have a loving hubby and although I am suffering pain more now due to over exerting my body I do not regret anything but wish I could tell my younger teenage self not to let others judge or upset me.Please watch this programme it delves into a lot of what disability can mean. We are stronger individuals than the able bodied can ever know.",2024,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14065578/

classicsoncall,"SpoilerAlfred Hitchcock's first talking movie came out in 1929. ""Blackmail"" was billed as 'The First British Sound Feature Length Film', and because it came out on the cusp of the transition from silents to talkies, the celebrated director actually directed both versions of the movie. Oddly, the talking version was released first followed by the silent, however in researching the same here on IMDb, I can only find a reference to the talking ""Blackmail"", a film I've seen and commented on. If anyone reading this knows otherwise, please advise.I caught this brand new 2024 documentary on Turner Classics with a couple early Hitchcock's I hadn't seen yet, and the information shared offers a neat insight into the director's style and repeated use of common themes throughout his career. As just one example taken directly from ""Blackmail"", the self-defense stabbing of a rapist by the picture's lead, Amy Ondra, is recycled in 1954's ""Dial M For Murder"" when Grace Kelly does the same with an assailant attempting to strangle her. During the same era as this picture, a spy is stabbed in the back in 1935's ""The 39 Steps"", while in the 1936 film ""Sabotage"", Sylvia Sidney stabs her husband with a kitchen knife. And of course, who can ever forget ""Psycho"".So it goes for the rest of this documentary. Numerous examples of Hitchcock's themes are referenced for the viewer's pleasure and enlightenment, including the frequent appearance of a blonde protagonist, the accusation of a wrong man or woman, the chase, the suspense, sexuality, murder and of course, the MacGuffin, that thing that motivates the plot but ultimately proves of no importance. Some are so subtle that you don't even think of it while watching, such as the frequent inclusion of food and eating in any number of Hitchcock's stories. These techniques were all ways to engage the viewer with the plot and characters of his movies.For anyone who's read any of my reviews of Hitchcock's movies, I found the director to be a mixed bag. I can accept his reputation as one of film's greatest directors, but I find myself questioning certain scenarios, such as an athletic looking man revealed to be the killer of three widows for their inheritance, successfully challenged by a niece almost half his size in 1943's ""Shadow of a Doubt"". There's also the sparrow attack down a chimney into a parlor in ""The Birds"", but wasn't it strange that no one in the same room screamed? That's just a couple of examples that I wound up questioning while watching Hitch's films.That aside, I thought this was a good documentary for Hitchcock aficionados and newcomers to his pictures alike. For non-fans, it might get you to check out some of his other work, which wouldn't be such a bad thing.",2025,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33583006/

gmallare,"When I first heard the soundtrack to Spring Awakening, I was blown away (even more so when I finally found a decent video of the play). I really connected with the themes and the characters of the show so when I heard that a documentary about the show was coming out, I had to watch it. It did not disappoint.This documentary is very heartwarming. It feels like you're seeing old friends reuniting after years apart. You get insight into what the show meant to the cast and the minds behind the musical and how it personally impacted them. The documentary also has some ""making of"" elements regarding the grind that the cast and production team had to go through to make Spring Awakening possible. It comes through the documentary that the cast and crew cared about the musical and each other.I do have to note, though, that this documentary is best appreciated by those who love Spring Awakening. It's more of a companion piece to the show than a stand-alone work, but it adds so much context to the show that makes me love Spring Awakening even more. If you have the time, I urge you to find a recording of Spring Awakening (there are some on Youtube) and then watch this documentary.",2022,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19393916/
ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Co-directors Philip Delaquis and Barbara Miller opt against an on-camera Q&A session with the Dalai Lama and instead allow His Holiness (the 14th Dalai Lama) to speak directly to the camera on topics pertinent to what's happening in the 21st century. This approach allows the film and his words to wash over us like a meditative event ... calm and soothing. His words not only guide us on ways to chill out, but also inspire us to pay close attention to the current situation. He opens by stating that ""everyone wants peace and happiness"". While logically, we believe this, yet the actions of some, leave us doubtful. Still, going with that premise, the Dalai Lama proceeds to stress the importance of finding a peaceful mind through deep breathing, compassion, education, and the power of nature. The filmmakers include some amazing archival footage dating back to his childhood and the upheaval in China that led him (and so many others) to be refugees to India, where he remains today at age 90. Obviously, this isn't a 'normal' movie, or even a typical documentary. More than anything it's a reminder ... a recommendation to reset our approach. We are so caught up in what he terms ""busy, busy, busy"" that it causes us stress and concern, leading to unhappiness. He says peace is the way to happiness, which is our purpose in life. By peace, he refers to a peaceful mind as well as a lack of war/conflict (resolved through dialogue) and a caring approach to our planet and environment. What a different world this would be if global leaders took the Dalai Lama's approach of compassion and kindness into their governing of nations.

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. OK, so this tribute to the 50th anniversary of THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE may seem a year late, but it was actually an award winner at the 2024 Venice Film Festival. This documentary has now gained distribution and will finally show for an audience that remains so loyal and respectful of that original film from director Tobe Hooper (who passed away in 2017). Documentarian Alexandre O Phillippe has a nice track record of exploring popular films, including his superb 78/52 (2017), which surgically analyzed the iconic shower scene in Hitchcock's masterpiece, PSYCHO. Fittingly, this documentary opens on a clip of Hooper's original film from 1974. It then takes a unique approach by dividing this into five chapters, each with insight and observations from one particular person of interest. Chapter One features comedian-actor Patton Oswalt describing his first viewing of the film. With his rare brand of humor, Oswalt provides a surprisingly in-depth perspective on the film, while making some spot-on comparisons to the original NOSFERATU, and the Bulgarian classic, MAN BITES Dog. He even opens our eyes to some similarities to the staircase scene in GONE WITH THE WIND ... the first time I've ever heard ""Chain Saw"" and GWTW mentioned in the same sentence. Especially worth noting is Oswalt emphasizing the importance of the fantastic Art Direction from the late Robert Burns'. Chapter Two puts Japanese filmmaker Takashi Mike in the spotlight. Best known for his films, ICHI THE KILLER (2001) and 13 ASSASSINS (2010), he explains how his younger self was a huge fan of Bruce Lee, which developed his interest in cinema. He then recalls a fascinating tale of showing up to a sold-out screening of Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS, and how fate took him around the block to his first-ever viewing of ""Chain Saw"". This opened his eyes to how movies could be dangerous ... and then he details the technical aspects of shooting on 16mm and blowing it up for the big screen to achieve the 'grainy' look. Chapter Three brings us Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, a renowned film critic from Australia. She provides a bit of a history lesson, recalling the ""Chain Saw"" was banned for years in Australia, and when she finally saw it, the source was a well worn and yellowed version which she compared to the heat of the Outback. In her discussion, she mentions Peter Weir's fantastic classic PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK (1975). Both can be labeled a bit avant-garde as films that make you FEEL something. Chapter Four could have been the most entertaining section, but unfortunately, the great horror writer Stephen King spent entirely too much time talking about other films. Rather than focus on THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, Mr. King rattles off other great film titles like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, THE SHINING, THE HAUNTING, THE INNOCENTS, and POLTERGEIST. Fortunately, he does bring Edgar Allan Poe into the conversation. Chapter Five, the final section, finds filmmaker Karyn Kusama (GIRLFIGHT, 2000; DESTROYER, 2018) focusing on the primal nature of Tobe Hooper's film, while also educating us on the landscape of myth. Ms. Kusama makes an excellent observation about the opening crawl in ""Chain Saw"" ... it really does plant the seed of ""a true story"" in our mind. In 1974, director Tobe Hooper released what would shockingly become an American Masterpiece, THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE. All these years later, the film still frightens viewers and continues to influence new generations of filmmakers. With an unusual approach, documentarian Alexandre O Phillippe pays tribute to the filmmaker and his work by giving artists a platform to explain what the film means to them. Good stuff ... except for that meat hook (gets me every time)! This documentary opened in New York and Los Angeles on September 19, 2025 and expands nationwide on September 26, 2025.",2025,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33029845/

pebsdad,"The best way to describe this is performance standup. This is a much loved Broadway ""show"" that everyone was trying to get their friends to go see and raving about everywhere. Alex also toured this show to a few cities but never reached me and I'm so glad I'm getting to see it here. It reminds me of the great Hannah Gadsby sets where a general theme is presented, expanded on, digressed from and told in a story manner. The callbacks are brilliant and I have never sat in my living room and howled, snorted and spilled my beverage to anyone before. This is smart performance, physical humor that eclipses all those high paid comedians who aren't really funny (they know who they are). I hope he comes up with another show and we get to journey again with him. I will introduce this to friends and watch is over and over.",2024,1,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31727542/

boblipton,"It's a concert film of Bill Murray and three musicians: Vanessa Perez, Jan Vogler, and Mira Wang recorded at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus in Athens. It was a worldwide concert tour that did very well. The musicians play Gershwin, Saint-Saens and Bernstein very well. Murray recites Whitman, Thurber, and sings very badly.Clearly the draw is Murray. The choice of what he performs is clearly his, and reflects the sort of writing thrust upon him in school, the sort of music that best exemplifies America. The musicians dress formally. Murray dresses like he's been woken from a nap, told people are coming on, put on some pants.The audience seems very appreciative. Were they Greeks?

ShadowsBeneathTheLight,"I used to like David Spade, but this was painful to watch. You know it's going to be a bad special when the first 10 minutes is about dealing with covid lockdowns and why we should never hug or shake hands ever again. I kept waiting for the funny. It never arrived, and instead I was treated to an hour of a middle age man telling mediocre stories doing bad voices. Even the audience was struggling through this. At most it sounded like maybe 20 people out of the 500 laughing. Like I said, I used to be a fan of David Spade, but this just seemed so divorced from his usual routine.

dannylee3782,"SpoilerGreat documentary. Perfectly encapsulates another example of undeniable capitalistic greed hurting people. I usually don't find anti-capitalist messages very appealing because historically we don't have a great track record. However, this documentary infuriated me on many different levels. How poor management resulted in hundreds of lives lost. How aiming for short-term gains caused a massive loss in the long term. Ironically, Boeing's stock prices that they cared so much about was never that badly affected by this crisis. It was more affected by Covid. Currently, Boeing's stock prices sit at a quarter of its high. It also angers me that poor management changed a longstanding culture of safety first. A singlehanded blow to decades of reputation. Really sad to see that.I have no complaints about the technical aspects of this documentary. Pacing was great and source material was adequately used. Some people may find the technicality of airplanes a little bit difficult, but I think they dumbed it down pretty well. Would recommend this to anyone that's interested in corporate failure and/or aviation. But I think this is a strong documentary with a well-constructed, resonating message. Definitely worth checking out.",2022,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11893274/

pkagioglu,"Decent amount of music research, check!Bringing attention to an excellent era of music, check!Calling it ""Yacht Rock"" is nothing but a weak marketing attempt, by pseudo trend-setters to start a new genre label.The music of that time is some of the best music ever made in the last 50 years, by monster musicians and they didn't have any such labels, in fact there was much blending of different genres.Bands like Toto, Dobbie Brothers, Steely Dan had a parade of top musicians in the recording sessions, some played in many other artists sessions.I think it is a great disrespect to try to lump them all into some generic, and completely arbitrary label.

boblipton,"Film historians and the family of Stuart and Budd Schulberg discuss the making, use, and impact of 1948's Nürnberg und seine Lehre.It always seems a bit bizarre to look at a film about making a particular film. A work of art needs to stand on its own merits, and offer a message for succeeding audiences if it is to survive. Yet, sometimes it happens that the details of a production are interesting. And sometimes it helps to understand a film in the context of its own time and place.And so the question arises: does this movie help to understand, to explain its subject film? Alas it does not... for me. But I am an American Jew who grew up in the shadow of the Holocaust, with parents and friends of parents World War Two veterans, knowing survivors of the concentration camps. Their world was, to a great extent, my world. The story told in Nuremberg does not need explaining to me, neither its causes, its reality, nor its impact.And so I cannot judge this movie. This is a movie made for some one else. It will have to be his or her task to judge it.",2025,6,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13836144/
classicsoncall,"SpoilerThis is a forceful and important piece of filmmaking to support the cause of 'Never Again'. With the prospect of the Nuremberg Trials scheduled to bring Nazi war criminals to justice in 1945, young military brothers Budd and Stuart Schulberg were tapped by director John Ford to investigate and uncover as much filmed evidence of the German promise to eliminate the Jewish people in territories under their control. Finding themselves in a race against time before all the film footage could be destroyed by the Nazi war machine, the brothers harried to various locations where they had clues as to where such records were stored. After they discovered a vast trove of remarkable film footage, they had to be certain that they used only German film production as proof of war crimes, as the Nuremberg Tribunal insisted that American footage not be used, as it could be open to questions of bias and tampering. Incredibly, German filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was instrumental in identifying the upper echelon members of Hitler's command, whose appearance in some of the retrieved footage documented their heinous deeds in both words and pictures. The Nuremberg Trial lasted two hundred sixteen days with five thousand, three hundred thirty exhibits covering two hundred fifty thousand pages of material, along with twenty-five thousand photos. One hundred thirty-nine witnesses to Nazi war crimes also testified. One would think that the film documentary would have been made immediately available for the world to witness the horrible atrocities shown in the footage, but with the Marshall Plan about to get underway to help a devastated Germany get back on its feet, the idea was scuttled and kept hidden from an international audience. And yet, one can't help but feel that man's inhumanity towards fellow man is alive and deep rooted as ever as evidenced by all the trouble spots in the world today. Why can't we ever learn?",2024,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13836144/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Fourteen years spent teaching advanced degree architectural students at Columbia led to her being denied tenure, so Ada Karmi-Melamede did what any self-respecting and incredibly talented architect would do ... she quit the job and bet on herself. It's a bet that has resulted in numerous high-profile projects in her homeland, Israel.Ada's story would likely remain an untold secret if not for her daughter, Yael Melamede. Yael directs the film, but more importantly, masterfully directs her mother Ada into opening up about her life and career. It's not an easy path for either woman, as Ada left her family to pursue her own career and passion for architecture, a step much more common for fathers than mothers.To quell any doubts as to whether this is just a family member attempting to create publicity, or whether Ada's work is deserving of such a tribute, one need only view some of her most famous projects: the Supreme Court of Israel, the Ben Gurion Airport, and the Open University of Israel. And beyond that are her contributions to New York: a master plan for Con Edison and a housing competition on Roosevelt Island. Should you need more, we see accolades from famed architects Frank Gehry, Keith Frampton, and Mose Sofdie. Despite her lack of widespread acclaim, Ada Karmi-Melamede is truly one of the most accomplished architects in the world.Adding intrigue, this documentary is not just about a talented architect. There is also the personal element which finds a grown woman striving to find connection with her mother ... a mother who admittedly didn't possess typical motherly attributes. One is a woman who longs to know more, while the other is a woman who tends to balk at saying much about herself, her life, or her reasons. Seeing the defensiveness fade away is quite something, and a tribute to daughter Yael for encouraging the connection. We learn much about her childhood, the family, the influences, and the life each had without the other.Ada is most comfortable talking about her profession. Her pencil versus computer segment strikes a chord, and when she reacts to a tour guide's description of her work, the moment is priceless. We begin to understand her passion when she discusses the Parthenon, and the shots of her own projects leave no doubt as to her influence. Ada's feelings on current Israeli politics are crystal clear, and the segment on ""Time"" provides a life lesson for everyone.Opens in NYC on May 9, 2025, and in LA on May 15, 2025.",2025,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26915722/

paul_m_haakonsen,"Without ever having heard about comedian Nate Bargatze, prior to stumbling upon this 2024 stand-up comedy special titled ""Your Friend, Nate Bargatze"" on Netflix, I still opted to check it out. Why? Well, maybe I had been missing on a great comedian here. Turned out that I hadn't. I found very little enjoyment in the material that Nate Bargatze had pieced together here, and there was nothing that tickled me in the right places, at least not before the very last part. So this 2024 was a dud in terms of entertaining me, a swing and a miss if you will. But the audience in the showed seemed to be adequately entertained throughout the course of the 63 minutes that the show ran for. I can't claim that having sat through 63 minutes of this has spurred me to go out and track down more of his shows, provided he has any. His particular sense of comedy just didn't align with mine and thus brought about no laughs for me. And as for Nate Bargatze's on-stage presence? Well, I wasn't impressed. He just sort of stood there, almost frigidly without much of any body language and such. My rating of the 2024 stand-up comedy show ""Your Friend, Nate Bargatze"" lands on a generous three out of ten stars.",2025,6,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33813061/

classicsoncall,"SpoilerI don't know how, but I was never aware of Stevie Ray Vaughan until well after he died in a helicopter crash, chronicled in this documentary by his brother Jimmie. I'm sorry I missed the brothers and their music, though I now look them up on You tube and thrill to their wonderful brand of blues music. This documentary features Jimmie Vaughan talking about growing up in Cliff Oak, Texas and how both he and Stevie picked up guitars at an early age and virtually self-taught themselves to play. In Jimmie's case, it came as a result of a broken collarbone from a high school football injury; his father bought him a fifty dollar guitar which he took to immediately. The early years of teenage bands and moving up in stature via recognition by music industry pros launched the boys, especially Stevie, to the heights of electric guitar success. So successful was Jimmie that he wound up making more money than his dad while still a teenager playing local gigs. Alongside Jimmie are music legends like Eric Clapton, Jackson Browne, Billy Gibbons and producer Nile Rodgers speaking of their fondness for the siblings, and lamenting the passing of a guitar god legend like Stevie, a life cut short at only thirty five. Old time and future fans of the Vaughan Brothers owe it to themselves to take a look at this informative documentary with only one slight downside - there's not enough music to satisfy the average blues fan.",2024,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22409096/

stevendbeard,"SpoilerI saw One to One: John & Yoko, starring John Lennon & Yoko Ono.This is a documentary that is partially about politics and partially a concert film. It starts in 1972 New York when John & Yoko came to live in America. The main reason for the move from England was for Yoko to find her estranged daughter. This film includes home movies, restored footage and unseen archives covering the 18 month time period that John & Yoko were living in Greenwich Village. After seeing a Geraldo Rivera report on tv about Willowbrook State School in Staten Island, New York where they were mistreating their special needs children, John decided to put on the only full length concert he ever performed, since leaving the Beatles. It was called One to One and he used the Plastic Ono Band with Elephant's Memory. The concert parts are interspersed with actual people and events that were also going on at the time, and you see people like Shirley Chishelm, Jerry Rubin, Allen Ginsberg, George Wallace, Andy Warhol, Stevie Wonder and President Richard Nixon. The concert parts of the film are good but I didn't care too much for the politics part. I grew up in the 60's and know about the riots, inequality for gays and women and the Vietnam war issues.It's rated R for violence, drug use, language and nudity and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.Like I said, the concert part is good but I didn't care for the politics.

classicsoncall,"SpoilerSince the last Tom Papa specials I've seen on Netflix were only from a few years ago, I was surprised to see how much older the comedian looked in this program. I think it may have been the beard stubble. In any event, his humor was till engaging with riffs on his daughters going away to college and leaving him and his wife as empty nesters. He claimed it was hard to be old, but I think he had a pretty good perspective on it. I was surprised when he stated ""I still shoplift"" with no disclaimer coming right after or anywhere else in his routine for that matter. I would hate to think the guy was encouraging petty theft as he heads toward retirement. With just a sprinkling of four-letter words, Papa is a comic who doesn't have to rely on a stream of obscenities a lot of his compatriots in the business resort to.

I can't imagine any one single individual selling out Dodger Stadium for a one man show, but Fluffy did it and an overhead shot of the stadium confirmed it. But I didn't get the impression this was an evening of entertainment, but more a reflection on Gabriel's life and personal situations that got him to where he is today. As such, there was not a lot of humor in his delivery, even when riffing on subjects like the Covid-19 pandemic, waiting on line at Starbucks, Halloween with son Frankie, or his introduction to country music. This would have been informative in an interview format with a host asking questions and Gabriel answering; it almost felt like an interview without a host. And stretching the show out to two hours made it somewhat of a chore to sit through. More than once I thought that this wasn't funny, although I did persevere to the end.

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Being the creative force behind what many consider to be the best TV show of all time - one that changed the face of television - is both a blessing and a burden. David Chase is that man, and his often dour disposition hides the creative genius behind ""The Sopranos"" (1999-2007). Oscar winning documentarian Alex Gibney (TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE, 2007; ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM, 2005) re-creates Dr. Melphi's office for his sit down with Chase, and it's a smooth move to encourage Chase to open up in the same setting where his creation, Tony Soprano, often let his guard down. This is not really meant as an introduction to garner new fans for reruns, but rather as a tribute to David Chase and a peek behind the curtain for hardcore fans.Don't worry ... it's not three hours of two guys talking. Gibney complements Chase's insight with a treasure trove of clips and interviews and background details, really serving up a deep dive for those who considered this show to be must-see TV. Chase actually quotes one of the best lines from the series when he says, ""'Remember when' is the lowest form of conversation"". By the end of the first (of two) part, many will be amazed at just how much of the show was inspired by David Chase's actual life and large Italian family. You might also be amazed at how fragile the environment can be for even the most successful of TV shows.Chase lets us in on some personal details, and nothing is more personal than his proclamation, ""My mother was nuts."" Fans will eat up the segment on Nancy Marchand, the veteran actor who played Livia, Tony's mother. Chase said Ms. Marchand just ""had it"" (what he wanted for the character based on his own mother). It's also interesting to learn that Chase's early career aspirations were for movies, not television. In fact, he envisioned this as a movie starring Robert DeNiro and Anne Bancroft. Of course, no one would back him, and when he converted it to a series, none of the networks had an interest either. It took upstart HBO, who at the time was only beginning the transition from Movies and Sports to series. The reception of ""Oz"" (1997) and ""Sex and the City"" (1998) set the table for HBO to give the green light to the risky venture that itself eventually set the table for shows such as ""Breaking Bad"".The conversation between Gibney and Chase is interspliced with clips from the show, as well as family video and pictures. Chase walks us through how the main characters were cast, and it's fascinating to watch the rough cuts of auditions - some who made it, and some who didn't (including former Cornell star RB and ""Hill Street Blues"" actor Ed Marinaro). This gives us a true behind-the-scenes glimpse at how things came together. We also hear from some of the show's writers who explain just how stressful things could get in the writers' room, even though HBO gave them significant creative control.There are segments featuring Michael Imperioli, Steve VanZandt, Lorraine Bracco, Tony Sirico, and Drea de Matteo. Perhaps the most enjoyable is watching Edie Falco (who was the last one cast in the principal cast) as she explains there were no ""trigger warnings"" for the show. She states it was just like real life, complete with racism, sexism, misogyny, and violence. It's hilarious hearing how sensitive Sirico was about his hair, and Drea walks us through her character's ending - just after Lorraine Bracco explains what happens when David Chase invites you to dinner.There are clips of the infamous ""ducks"" from the pilot, and Chase comments on the critical raves that immediately rolled in - plus the pressures of additional seasons. Writer-Producer Terrence Winter joined the show in the second season, and he's interviewed here. Winter has since gone on to write and/or produce projects such as ""Boardwalk Empire"" and THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), the latter of which got him an Oscar nomination.The deaths of Nancy Marchand and series star James Gandolfini are handled with grace, including a clip of an emotional Chase speaking at Gandolfini's funeral. We hear about the toll playing Tony took on Gandolfini, and how some of the cast were there for him in times of darkness and need. Gandolfini died in 2013 at age 51 from a heart attack. It's interesting to learn that Chase only directed two episodes himself - the first and the last. And speaking of the finale, we see clips of Holsten's and hear ""Don't Stop Believin"" while reliving how that finale shocked viewers and generated so much discussion. Chase addresses this by saying, ""The truth is ...""

paul_m_haakonsen,"When I stumbled upon this this 2024 Netflix stand-up comedy show, I had never even heard about Matt Rife. And thus, since I had no idea who he was or how funny he hopefully was, then I opted to watch the show and give it a fair chance. Much can be said for the contents of the show, as I assume a lot of people will not overly enjoy the interaction between the comedian and the audience, but it does require some quick thinking and the ability to twist even the most serious of subjects to something funny. If nothing else, then it was certainly a different way to deliver a comedy show. I did enjoy the interaction with the crowd, though it was something that I think would grow stale quickly if done again and again in each new show. Matt Rife does feel naturally at home on the stage in front of the audience, and he was good at including the audience. Well, duh, since it was the core essence of this particular show. But I feel that he handled himself well on the stage. I was adequately entertained throughout the course of the 54 minutes that the show ran for. However, ""Matt Rife: Lucid - A Crowd Work Special"" is hardly a show that warrants more than a single viewing. My rating of ""Matt Rife: Lucid - A Crowd Work Special"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",2025,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32986357/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Having one's name or work associated Hitler typically (but somehow not always these days) marks one as a pariah or persona non grata. For artists, the rules can be a bit blurred, and filmmaker Andres Veiel takes on the story of Leni Riefenstahl, in hopes of removing some of the blur. Leni Riefenstahl was a former actress who became the Reich's preeminent filmmaker best known as the director of TRIUMPH OF THE WILL (1935), the ultimate propaganda film for the Nazi party, and OLYMPIA (1938), her version of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Having access to her private family archives, filmmaker Veiel takes the deepest dive yet into her life and approach. He opens with her appearance on a 1978 talk show where she is asked if she now considers her association with Hitler to have been a mistake. She bows her head and the clip is cut before we hear the answer (if there was one), though the remainder of the documentary uses her own words and actions to pretty much answer the question. There have been other films about Leni. The most well-known is probably Ray Muller's THE WONDERFUL, HORRIBLE LIFE OF LENI RIEFENSTAHL (1993), which Veiel references here. Still, nothing previous feeds us the wealth of photos and video clips served up by Veiel, offering such a full profile of one of the most controversial people from the WWII era. It should be noted that Leni died in 2003 at age 101, so she lived many decades of facing scrutiny and scorn. During her interviews and appearances on talk shows, very little attention was paid to the innovative filmmaking techniques she used in her work, but rather the attention was on her affiliation with Nazis, especially her 'friendly' relationship with Hitler. Photos of her with Hitler and Goebbels are shown, and the backlash from Goebbels' diaries are discussed. There is also a segment on Albert Speer, part of Hitler's inner circle and one of the war criminals sentenced at the Nuremburg trials. What we notice is that Leni was no wallflower. She often spoke her mind, and continued to hang her hat on the ""art"" label ... going so far as to state (in 1980) that 'art is the opposite of politics.' This defense likely eased her conscience a bit, but we can't help but be stunned when she claims ""Peace"" was the theme of her TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. It's a word that only she would associate with that film. In her defense, Leni states that most Germans supported the efforts and that things didn't end well for dissidents of the Reich. Mostly we find Leni in the George Costanza corner - 'it's not a lie if you believe it.' She was a smart and talented and strong woman who was calculating in everything she did or said. She discusses her long relationship (business and personal) with Horst Kettner, and we see the lovely home they shared. We also learn that it took Leni ten years to write her memoirs, and we are left wondering how much guilt she experienced - despite claiming that she knew nothing of the Holocaust (a topic Veiel addresses). We have all seen her extraordinary camera work on Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics, yet no amount of filmmaking genius or creativity can overshadow her work for Hitler. Was she the first 'cancelled' artist? In fact, regardless of the pain, she must be remembered ... something this project from Andres Veiel ensures. IN THEATERS

imseeg,"I only knew Luther Vandross from his many old great hit songs on the radio back in the days, so I am not a diehard fan, but this documentary gave me so many goosebumps and such a good feeling! Really touched by it (and surprised by it as well...)What's most surprising to me was the fact that before he got known as a singer he wrote so many songs for other famous singers who all cherished his songwriting skills AND his background singing performances, like Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin and David Bowie.Famous actor Jamie Fox describes several witty memories of him stealing girls' hearts with playing Luther Vandross songs while courting them, making all the girls melt in his arms!Singers all have their peak and then they mostly fade away from the spotlights, but I never knew what happened to Luther Vandross and this movies story about his downfall is so touching, yet still so sad that I dont wanna tell about it here in this review.I can highly recommend watching this doumentary if you have doubts about being it worth the watch ESPECIALLY if you are not a big fan of his work!What a voice!

boblipton,"Elvis Mitchell talks us through Hitchcock's first sound feature, and discusses how to view Hitchcock's later works by repeated themes and techniques.There is a conflict in looking at artists in any medium. Do we value them for their protean ability or for their particular style? Do we admire William Wyler, who could work in many, disparate genres and produce great movies, or the specialist, like Hitchcock. Hitchcock worked mostly with thrillers, his themes murder, death, pursuit, and flight. Yes, yes, his morbid wit was always on display, and he directed several straight comedies, and even one musical. But is anyone going to claim greatness for MR. AND MRS. SMITH or WALTZES FROM VIENNA? I think not.The best thing to do is to admire both Wyler and Hitchcock when they are on their games. We admire Hitchcock for his constant visual inventiveness. Yet , as Mitchell points out, he reused stuff constantly, from the blonde leading lady to the mirror shot. Was this the first time Hitchcock used these? Frankly, I couldn't say. But Mitchell claims it, so for the sake of argument, I will concede the points. Does this lay hob with the assertion of his constant inventiveness?Yes. In fact, it argues a particular style. Critics love style, because it offers them a cheat-sheet approach to a work of art. Pointing out style can make someone look clever, like being able to identify a particular painter. Us less exalted audience members enjoy them because they work. They're a technique that works. Unless they're used at every opportunity until they become lazy and cloying Look at one Margaret Keane painting, and you may appreciate them. Look at a thousand of her big-eyed subjects and they become monstrous and lazy. Hitchcock may have been monstrous. I think he enjoyed that. But he was never lazy.",2025,4,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33583006/

ma-cortes,"This documentary premiered at the last edition of the Venice Film Festival and introduces us to Hayao Miyazaki like never before. Hayao, founder of Studio Ghibli, has been transporting us to unique universes with his films for over 50 years. My Neighbor Tororo, Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke are the top ten of his films, which have already become cult classics. Thanks to privileged access to his work and interviews with his son, director Goro Miyazaki, and with Toshio Suzuki, producer and friend of Hayao, we discover the life, cinema and influences of the director. In fact, In 2014, Miyazaki was awarded an Honorary Academy Award for his impact on animation and cinema.Miyazaki's early work was as a mangaka, when Hayao first saw the film The Panda and the Magic Serpent, he made the decision to dedicate himself to film animation. His first film was Panda and Friends, made with his usual collaborator Takahata. And he worked for the powerful Toei film company , working in Horus: Prince of the Sun (1968), a precursor to the ' Shónen style' in anime (Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto), its then revolutionary ideas were copied and perfected to the point of exhaustion in the most popular series and films of the genre. Surrounded by a young and ambitious team led by the then unknown and newcomer Hayao Miyazaki, he provided the set design and ideological support for much of this film. But this was a time of student revolt and strikes and director Takahata and Miyazaki (future founders of Studio Ghibli who met here for the first time) were idealists with left-wing convictions at the time. This caused a strong clash with Toei, since the working conditions were precarious and exhausting. His next film was ¨The Castle of Cagliostro¨, which was a commercial failure, however today it is a highly revered film and a cult film. Due to the previous failure, Hayao became a mangaka again, drawing the manga series, Nausicaa. Due to its success, he continued with the film adaptation: Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984). He founded Ghibli Studios with his partner, friend and long-time collaborator Takahata. Since then, he has since directed, written, and produced many other films with Isao Takahata. More recently, he has produced with Toshio Suzuki. All enjoyed critical and box office success, in particular Princess Mononoke (1997). It received the Japanese equivalent of the Academy Award for Best Film and was the highest-grossing (about USD $150 million) domestic film in Japan's history at the time of its release.In addition to animation, he also draws manga. His major work was Nausicaä, an epic tale he worked on intermittently from 1982 to 1984 while he was busy making animated films. Another manga Hikotei Jidai, later evolved into Porco Rosso (1992). Other important animes were : Castle in the Sky (1986), Ponyo (2008) , Tales from Earthsea (2006) along with his son Goro Miyazaki, and, of course, his masterpiece Spirited away (2001).The documentary is very instructive, thanks to it we learn the main keys to Hayao's work: his interest in the environment, ecology, natural and man-made disasters, environment, climate change, Japanese religion as Shintoism, Animism , spiritual beings like the Camy, etc. He was born during the Second World War, and suffered the consequences as a child, being very worried due to his mother's tuberculosis. We learn of his interest in aviation because his relatives worked in aircraft manufacturing, especially he loved the iconic plane in his films, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, which operated in WWII. As well as his fondness for vegetation and trees such as the camphor tree, especially the one located in Nagoya.",2024,1,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33030449/

ma-cortes,"This documentary was decently directed by Carmen Chaplin, Charles Chaplin's granddaughter, and explores, like never before, the personality of Charles Chaplin , recalling the great figure of her grandfather and revealing his unknown Romani origins. Thus, it investigates the possible Romani ancestry of the great comedian, referencing the multitude of letters he received , but focusing on one written by Jack Hill, which acknowledged his Romani birth. This letter was kept as a treasure by Chaplin in his nightstand, and he never showed it to anyone. The letter was discovered by his children after the actor's death and revealed that he was not born in London, but in the Romani settlement of Black Patch, on the outskirts of Birmingham. Based on this discovery, Michael Chaplin, one of the artist's eldest son, embarks on a journey through Europe to find out the obscure family roots and delve into how Romany ancestry influenced his father's life and work. And other children also appear, giving insight into these origins, such as Christopher Chaplin, and the more famous Geraldine Chaplin , who played in ""Zhivago"" was married to director Carlos Saura. Along with the opinions of great artists such as director Emir Kusturica whose films usally show the gypsy world, Claire Bloom , who played ""Limelight"" alongside the genius, or Johnny Depp, whose interview is conducted in a gypsy wagon he owned since he played a gypsy in Sally Potter's film: ""The Man who Cried"".For all of this, one of the main participants in the documentary is Michael Chaplin, who attempts to explore his family's origins. In fact, as a child, he performed a succulent role for his father in the film "" A King in New York"" . Although it seems that Charles Chaplin's ancestors were two music-hall singers, they divorced and his mother suffered from mental problems. So, Charles and his older brother Sidney Chaplin were abandoned, ending up in an orphanage where they suffered all kinds of deprivation, ailments and extreme hunger. There are also priceless documentary still of Charlie Chaplin and his family, his wife Oona, and his eight children. There are also images of Chaplin, completely moved and dancing joyfully while a gypsy band sings and dances.Of course, several scenes from short and feature films that Chaplin acted in and directed are included, in which he partially reveals his free and gypsy spirit. These include the shorts: "" Charlot vagabond"", ""The Pilgrim"", ""Night at the theatre"", "" The Pilgrim"", and the feature films: "" The Kid"", ""The Circus"", ""The Gold Rush"", ""Modern Times"", ""City Lights, ""A King in New York"", and his best and most popular, ""The Great Dictator"", starred Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at the time.",2025,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2390518/

ksf-2,"Released in 2023. A documentary on netflix. Discusses the freedoms that germans had prior to the nazis coming to power in the 1930s. This time was known as the weimar republic in germany. Lots of time spent on recreating scenes of couples dancing, kissing, and just having fun in the eldorado nightclub in berlin. The narrator spends some time talking about ernst rohm. An angry, gay, violent man. And close friend of adolf hitler. The narrator highlights several couples, who actually lived and had relationships at the time. Then rohm was made head of the SA, the group responsible for arrests, and putting people in jail. And apparently only too happy to disrupt the quiet, calm way of life in berlin. Suddenly, being queer, trans, or homosexual was against the law. At first, germany provided passes to trans persons, allowing them fre travel. Until it was all no longer okay. This was a huge change. Of course, the nightclub was closed, and used by the third reicht. The medical institute assisting the trans people is destroyed, and its books burned. A sad chapter in history. Directed by benjamin cantu, matt lambert. It's quite good! More details on kristalnacht, rohm, night of the long knives, and the eldorado nightclubs of berlin can all be found in wikipedia dot org.",2025,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27906298/

classicsoncall,"SpoilerIt's rare to find a comedian performance on Netflix that doesn't devolve into obscenity, so in that respect, Leanne Morgan was a refreshing change. Like Jerry Seinfeld, she works 'clean', and she can be funny doing it. She called this performance part of her 'Big Panty Tour' though that's not mentioned in the promo for this special. With only a quick mention of that, Morgan goes on to describe elements of her family life, with particular attention to her overachiever husband - ""I love him, I just don't want to be with him.""
It's all in good fun, as she laments how she gained weight during Covid via Jello salads, while taking swipes against perimenopause and fighting over the thermostat with Hubby Chuck. Her delivery is a bit static, but punctuated with facial expressions and body language that adds some life to the presentation. Her routine may not be laugh out loud funny, but she did get a handful of chuckles out of this viewer, and for that, I'd probably catch a few more of her shows.",2024,4,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27192839/

JC-4455,"SpoilerI admit I knew nothing about pangolins before watching this film, and expected to learn a lot about them. But the pangolin was almost secondary to the character of the man who was caring for it.What concerned me even more, being a wildlife rehabber myself, is the caretaker did not treat the pangolin like a wild animal. But instead was constantly coddling it as if it were a pet cat. Bringing it inside a building at night, following it around everywhere, petting it, picking it up. This seems like a death sentence for the pangolin. This animal needs to fear humans, not think they are his friend. This animal is not a pet. It is supposed to be wild. This caretaker was not trained on the basics of rehabilitating wild animals. It is imperative to keep them wild and make them afraid of humans. Especially in this case where poachers are causing the demise of this species. Honestly it made me really mad. I felt that the caregiver was better suited working for a cat or dog rescue organization, and the woman supervising him did not seem much better. I hope and pray these pangolins truly are being given a second chance and I'm misinterpreting this, but as a rehabber it seemed like they were doing so many things wrong.",2025,1,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27931052/

imseeg,"This documentary clocks at 4 and a half hours, of which the first 2 hours are about the absolute birth of computer shooter games (Wolfenstein, DOOM and Quake) and the second 2 hours are about the more recently released widely popular games like Halo etc.I was confronted with Wolfenstein in the early eighties and I had a fun blast. But a few years later I underwent ""DOOM"" and that really blew my mind! And I still think DOOM is one of the best shooter games ever made! It's simplicity, combined with ultimate shock effects, still freak me out some 30 years later. What a thrill ride!Especially the really early development of 3D visuals on the computer (back in the late seventies) is fun to watch. The guys who invented all these wonderful programs are being interviewed and what achievements they have made for the world of computer gaming.Nice watch, although quite long, but one can choose what to watch. Interesting insights into this massive virtual world which is the biggest grossing part of the entertainment industry nowadays.

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness (on the edge of town). What keeps a band together for decades? It could be the shared love of music ... although many bands have split up with members continuing on in solo careers. It could be a love of performing ... but again, a band isn't needed for that. It could be friendship or family ... lifelong friends Paul and John couldn't save The Beatles, and a brotherly feud broke up Creedence Clearwater Revival. Certainly ""luck"" plays a role ... too many deaths to count have caused the demise of bands through the years. Although no clear answer exists, it's likely a blend of all the above combined with a certain spiritual bonding. Nowhere is that more evident than with the E Street Band. Of course, the band has a dynamic leader in (the once shy) Bruce Springsteen, but it's obvious these musicians like and respect each other, and very much value what they have built together.Having been a Springsteen fan since the early 1970's, I can't possibly be overly objective towards Thom Zimny's documentary, so you've been warned. Zimny released THE BEACH BOYS documentary earlies this year, and he has a long-standing affiliation with Springsteen on music videos and other documentaries, including LETTER TO YOU (2020) and WESTERN STARS (2019). This latest is centered on the band's 2023 tour, their first in six years and first since the pandemic. However, rather than a traditional concert flick, Zimny takes us behind the scenes for the band's reunion, early rehearsals, and process while on the road. Most insightful are the musings from the individual band members, while Bruce's narration provides some structure to the film.Bruce kicks us off by recalling that as a kid, he dreamed of playing music in front of screaming fans. It's hard to imagine his dreams were ever as big as the reality he's living. What inspired this documentary was his promise that when the pandemic ended, he'd throw ""a big party"". That's what led to the E Street Band's reunion for their first tour in six years. We learn bits and pieces of history as it pertains to how the band came together, and though the rehearsal time is short, Bruce explains his goals are to ""shake the dust off the band"" and establish the playlist for the tour. While it's only hinted at a few times, it seems clear that his run on Broadway influenced the vision he had for this tour.Opening night in Tampa is as exciting for the band as it is for the fans. A recurring theme for this film is the crowd shots - often close-ups of fans and their emotional reaction (tears flow freely). We can't help but view this as spiritual for so many - the Church of E Street, if you will. Bruce is crystal clear in his desire to tell a story with the show; a story long-time manager Jon Landau describes as 'living life now'. The show pays tribute to bandmembers lost - Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici, and Bruce's wife and bandmate Patty Scialfa briefly discusses the health scare that has her cautiously participating in shows whenever possible.One of the highlights is the anticipation of the tour arriving in Barcelona. Whatever you've heard about the crowds in Europe, what we witness goes even beyond. These fans remind me so much of those early days as they express their pure appreciation and raw emotion driven by the music. Another aspect that becomes obvious as the tour progresses is that, despite being a huge band on stage, the E Street Band is remarkably talented and incredibly tight musically. This entertainment spectacle is first and foremost a musical gem, and Steve Van Zandt (as Musical Director) probably doesn't receive the recognition he deserves from the fans for his attention to musical details.The segment on the cover of ""Nightshift"" is particularly telling on how things come together for both the music and the stage presentation. It's noted that the song has turned into a 'showstopper' on tour and the film makes it obvious why. Insights from band members throughout the film infer a blended magic with influences of Jazz, R & B, Soul, and Jazz, and the music provides the proof. Piano work from Professor Roy Bittan and sax work from Clarence's nephew Jake cover multiple styles, and when the band cuts loose, rock music has rarely been better. The film leaves us with a bit of uncertainty. Alone on stage with his acoustic guitar, Bruce (now 75 years old) sings ""Last Man Standing"" (noting the recent passing of George Theiss leaves Bruce as the only survivor of his original band, The Castiles). As narrator he refers to ""yesterdays and goodbyes"", and then proclaims he'll continue ""until the wheels come off."" If it's his goodbye, the legacy spans over 50 years. If the wheels stay on, we'll chomp at the bit to see what the Boss brings us next.Premieres on Hulu and Disney+ on October 25, 2024.",2024,2,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32368703/

classicsoncall,"SpoilerAlfred Hitchcock's first talking movie came out in 1929. ""Blackmail"" was billed as 'The First British Sound Feature Length Film', and because it came out on the cusp of the transition from silents to talkies, the celebrated director actually directed both versions of the movie. Oddly, the talking version was released first followed by the silent, however in researching the same here on IMDb, I can only find a reference to the talking ""Blackmail"", a film I've seen and commented on. If anyone reading this knows otherwise, please advise.I caught this brand new 2024 documentary on Turner Classics with a couple early Hitchcock's I hadn't seen yet, and the information shared offers a neat insight into the director's style and repeated use of common themes throughout his career. As just one example taken directly from ""Blackmail"", the self-defense stabbing of a rapist by the picture's lead, Amy Ondra, is recycled in 1954's ""Dial M For Murder"" when Grace Kelly does the same with an assailant attempting to strangle her. During the same era as this picture, a spy is stabbed in the back in 1935's ""The 39 Steps"", while in the 1936 film ""Sabotage"", Sylvia Sidney stabs her husband with a kitchen knife. And of course, who can ever forget ""Psycho"".So it goes for the rest of this documentary. Numerous examples of Hitchcock's themes are referenced for the viewer's pleasure and enlightenment, including the frequent appearance of a blonde protagonist, the accusation of a wrong man or woman, the chase, the suspense, sexuality, murder and of course, the MacGuffin, that thing that motivates the plot but ultimately proves of no importance. Some are so subtle that you don't even think of it while watching, such as the frequent inclusion of food and eating in any number of Hitchcock's stories. These techniques were all ways to engage the viewer with the plot and characters of his movies.For anyone who's read any of my reviews of Hitchcock's movies, I found the director to be a mixed bag. I can accept his reputation as one of film's greatest directors, but I find myself questioning certain scenarios, such as an athletic looking man revealed to be the killer of three widows for their inheritance, successfully challenged by a niece almost half his size in 1943's ""Shadow of a Doubt"". There's also the sparrow attack down a chimney into a parlor in ""The Birds"", but wasn't it strange that no one in the same room screamed? That's just a couple of examples that I wound up questioning while watching Hitch's films.That aside, I thought this was a good documentary for Hitchcock aficionados and newcomers to his pictures alike. For non-fans, it might get you to check out some of his other work, which wouldn't be such a bad thing.",2025,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33583006/

It's a very enlightening doco, from start to finish.Springsteen, the Sopranos, political activism, ""Home Alone"" music, Little Steven's Underground Garage and more...it's all here.Fascinating.",2025,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32149801/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. As parents we fool ourselves into believing we know our children and what they are up to. After all, they live in the same house and eat the same meals. Norwegian documentarian Benjamin Ree shows us quite a contrast to this theory. What happens when a loving family discovers their son's secret life much too late?Trude and her husband Robert were thrilled when their son Mats was born in 1989. Shock and disappointment hit hard when Mats was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a rare degenerative muscle disease for which there is no cure. Trude describes the pain of watching her son grow weaker. He had little appetite, became wheelchair bound, and made no real friends. As he got older, the parents refused to limit his computer time, as it was the only thing Mats seemed to want to do.At age 18, Mats started a blog. By age 25 he was dead. His final blog entry was ""Musings of Life"". Since the parents had Mats' password, Robert posted ""The Journey has Come to an End."" The family, including Mats' sister Mia, assumed that was the end of it. What followed was a true blessing (and shock) for the family. Tributes and remembrances of Mats streamed in from the online community. It turns out, Mats was a vital and active member of the Starlight group within the World of Warcraft gaming field. Mats had created a new persona known as Ibelin, and he lived an online life that was impossible for him in the real world.Some of these Starlight folks held a memorial for Mats, which meant so much to the family. We hear directly from some of the folks Mats had helped along the way. He was described as intuitive at helping other lost souls. His dad calculated that Mats had spent approximately 20,000 hours online over the last ten years of his life, and the family was elated that Mats had not led the life of isolation they assumed, and instead thrived behind the Ibelin avatar. This revelation was a true blessing, and it's told beautifully in this documentary.On Netflix beginning October 25, 2024.",2024,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19811010/

paul_m_haakonsen,"Without ever having heard about comedian Nate Bargatze, prior to stumbling upon this 2024 stand-up comedy special titled ""Your Friend, Nate Bargatze"" on Netflix, I still opted to check it out. Why? Well, maybe I had been missing on a great comedian here. Turned out that I hadn't. I found very little enjoyment in the material that Nate Bargatze had pieced together here, and there was nothing that tickled me in the right places, at least not before the very last part. So this 2024 was a dud in terms of entertaining me, a swing and a miss if you will. But the audience in the showed seemed to be adequately entertained throughout the course of the 63 minutes that the show ran for. I can't claim that having sat through 63 minutes of this has spurred me to go out and track down more of his shows, provided he has any. His particular sense of comedy just didn't align with mine and thus brought about no laughs for me. And as for Nate Bargatze's on-stage presence? Well, I wasn't impressed. He just sort of stood there, almost frigidly without much of any body language and such. My rating of the 2024 stand-up comedy show ""Your Friend, Nate Bargatze"" lands on a generous three out of ten stars.",2025,6,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33813061/

paul_m_haakonsen,"Now, I was not familiar with comedian Andrew Schulz prior to stumbling upon the 2025 stand-up comedy special ""Andrew Schulz: Life"" on Netflix. And since I had never seen him perform before, of course I opted to check out his comedy. The contents of the show was fair enough, though there is a lot of focus on below-the-belt material, which sort of grew a bit tiring and felt like it was yanked out of the 1990s. I had hoped and expected a bit more proper comedy, I have to admit, that I am well-past the below-the-belt type of comedy. But there were some good moments here and there throughout the 59 minutes that the show ran for. Andrew Schulz does have a good charisma and feels very natural on the stage. However, the frequent mustache twirl was a bit distracting. I found this show to be fair enjoyable and entertaining, though it is hardly a show that warrants more than a single viewing. My rating of ""Andrew Schulz: Life"" lands on a five out of ten stars.",2025,4,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt35705915/

ferguson-6,"Greetings again from the darkness. In 2022, Kathryn Ferguson released a documentary on singer and activist Sinead O'Connor. It was Ms. Ferguson's first feature-length documentary, after a few shorts and videos. This time out, her focus is on renowned actor Humphrey Bogart. Now, opening on your subject's funeral might be an unusual way to begin a profile, but the star-studded service drives home the point that Bogart's life touched many. He was true Hollywood royalty.One would expect the profile of one of the biggest movie stars of all time to provide a chronological rundown of his films. Although his film resume is certainly not short-changed, the director takes a more personal approach by structuring Bogie's life according to how the five most influential women impacted him. Those five are: his mother, Maud Humphrey, and his four wives (in order), Helen Menken, Mary Philips, Mayo Methot, and of course, Lauren Bacall. We are guided through each of these relationships, with neither good nor bad being withheld.Much of the time is spent with narrator Kerry Shale reciting Bogart's own words from writings, journals, letters, etc. Shale offers neither a mimic of Bogie's distinctive voice nor a smooth sound for our ears. Still, there is heft and meaning to Bogart's words, especially when they are synchronized with an incredible bounty of archival footage, film clips, and photographs. Numerous interviews are included from son Stephen Bogart, directors Howard Hawks and John Huston, and actress Kathryn Hepburn, as well as others. There is also plenty from Lauren Bacall, who famously met Bogart when she was a 19-year-old actress on the set of TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT (1944). The two were married from 1945 through 1957 (his death). It was a true love story, and not nearly as tumultuous as his time with third wife Mayo Methot, who shot at him and stabbed him!There is a segment on Bogie's first career - a baby model - and his own words describe this relationship with his mother as he looks back at his childhood. We hear about his time in the Navy, as well as his love of chess and the water ... especially time spent sailing on his boat, Santana. We also hear about his quick temper and his alcoholism, and it's fascinating to learn that it was actress Greer Garson who heard his cough and insisted that he see a doctor - a visit that resulted in a cancer diagnosis.After years as a contract player in the studio system, it was HIGH SIERRA (1940) that set him on the road to superstardom. Bogart's career included such iconic roles as Sam Spade (THE MALTESE FALCON, 1941), Rick Blaine (CASABLANCA, 1943), Philip Marlowe (THE BIG SLEEP, 1946), and Lt Commander Queeg (THE CAINE MUTINY, 1954). One of my personal favorites was his role as Dixon Steele in Nicholas Ray's IN A LONELY PLACE (1950) with Gloria Grahame. When they hear the name Humphrey Bogart, many movie fans picture the trench coat, hat, and cigarette ... or the broken love story that begins a friendship. But there was much more behind the scenes. After directing Bogie to his only Oscar in THE AFRICAN QUEEN (1951), director John Huston delivered the eulogy at the funeral for his friend, also putting the final touches on this in-depth profile.Opens in select theaters on November 15, 2024.",2024,3,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32736393/

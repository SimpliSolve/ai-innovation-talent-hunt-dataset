ksgillihan,"Being an activist is not a bad thing. Many huge changes in our society were brought out by the movements of activists. However, if you want to sink your heart and soul into something, at least be honest and upfront about it. Consider the fact that the very notion of the case of Michael Brown being not about race in any way; you might want to take that into account when you want to form your life around something and then turn it into a film Remember ""hands up, don't shoot?' Yeah that never happened. We've known this for years and years yet there are still people out there who swear it happened and they rant on and on about the lie the media made up when the case first happened. These kinds of people require strife and division in order to feel like they have a place or that they are important. Or most likely, for nothing more than attention. Michael Brown was not killed by a blood-thirsty and racist police officer, he was killed because he was caught doing criminal things and he tried to take the officers gun. That is a fact. Two different investigations including one by the FBI, spear-headed by the attorney general of the United States even. They found that the officer did nothing wrong. Yet the media never said they got things incorrect. Then never even addressed it. How is that ok? This film is a farse based on a lie.",1,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32526781/

ksgillihan,"From his humble beginnings as an army brat, Shaq paved his way towards the NBA with grit and hard work. He became the legend that he idolized watching NBA stars while growing up. Being the most dominant center of all time Shaq has had tremendous success in his life but he never has let it go to his head. His loving family was always there to support him and teach him valuable life lessons that he carried with him all through his career and life. While he has made a great deal of money in his career, he has also spent lots of it supporting people all over the USA. This is my favorite side of Shaq. The human side. As big as he is, his heart is even bigger. He regularly helps out those in need and has his own foundation set up to help kids who do not have the same opportunities as others. He has paid for people's bills and purchased items for people he doesn't even know, just because he cares. He is a quality person. He is also hilarious in interviews and on Inside the NBA. If there were more people like Shaq, the world would be a better place.",9,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22876148/

ksgillihan,"I was waiting for this movie after seeing the very interesting trailers for it a few months ago. I was hoping for something new and fresh in an area flooded with do-gooders and the upright. Thankfully this movie delivers on this and more. The premise of this film is not one we have seen before in the ""superhero"" genre. What would the world do if a super-powered life form came to Earth and realized that we were all just insects to it? It starts out very ""Clark Kent"" like with the couple who have no children happening upon a child falling from the heavens. The parents see this as a blessing. As if the universe heard their cries for a child and answered them. Soon though, this Smallville scene takes a turn towards absolute terror. This ""child"" isn't what he seems to be. He isn't a boy, or a human. He's something altogether different. I was very pleased at the difference in the normal storytelling we see from Hollywood. Very entertaining and very interesting.",8,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7752126/

1,6,Docudrama of the life of St Patrick,john-dawson-614-792694,n/a,16/08/2025,"Part documentary, part reconstructionary drama, this film relies mainly on St Patrick's own written account of his life, miraculously preserved. A little ponderous but a creditable attempt to present his life. Interesting if you're interested, otherwise probably not.",False
2,7,I am Patrick,orourkephilip,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am no saying that I agree totally with the interpretations, but it is well done. I enjoyed it.",False
3,7,Documentary On Life Of St Patrick,chiumt,n/a,16/08/2025,"A biographical account of the life of Patrick, with religious overtones. A pretty well made documentary, though it can get melodramatic at times. An accurate picture of a patron saint.",False
4,3,If You Can Watch It,loreleimercer,n/a,16/08/2025,"The company in charge of this movie are incredibly unreasonable. There's a reason I Am Patrick has so few reviews. It was never really released. After Covid happened they made it to where you could only buy it on a shadily made website and even then, they won't send you a down load, they send your a literal DVD. Its a travesty that such an amazing important uplifting movie was hidden from the world when we need it most.. I hope those producers actually grow a soul and release the film everyone worked do hard on.",False

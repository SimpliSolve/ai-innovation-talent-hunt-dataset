1,8,"Raw, emotional, human.",adinagolgojan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI can't belive I'm the first person to write a review but I just finished the documentary and felt the need to come here.This is probably the most real outlook we would get into the life of a k-pop star for a very long time, the documentary is very artistic , making a connection between the very raw interview and the story of ""Dorothy"" from ""Wizzard Of Oz "".Her interview was almost uncut, you could see how much time and care Suli took for awnsering each question, there are minutes of complete silence where you could feel all the emotions she's going through, which I think is very brave on the director's part to leave them in.The most touching part for me was when she said most people don't think of celebrities as humans, which honestly applies to her very well because she was always sold and exploited as a product like she mentioned.My only complaint would be that because it's so long I feel like some parts of artistic shots in between her interview chapters were a little unnecessary or misplaced, and also I don't see the point of the documentary having 2 episodes, the first one being her episode of Persona.Overall a real, touching and quiet documentary that explores the many sides of Suli and her journey as k-pop star, actress and human.",True
2,10,profound elegance,Steve L,n/a,16/08/2025,"It can feel at times a bit ghoulish and other times very sad to watch such an intimate portrait of a recent suicide victim, but this multi-talented woman has important things to tell us, and she expresses herself with profound elegance.There are 2 episodes of Persona here. They consist of the first of what would have been five short art movies, followed by a feature-length documentary based on interviews with Choi Jin Ri, who has left us a great legacy here.The short is a kind of surreal fantasy, full of grotesque humour. The documentary is one of the most moving pieces I've watched in a long time.",False
3,10,They don't see us as humans,alaningle7,n/a,16/08/2025,"Choi Jinri was a child actress who came to prominence as a member of the k pop band f(x) where she took the stage name Sulli. She left the group in 2015 and pursued acting and a career as a single artist but tragically took her own life in 2019. Persona Sulli is in two parts, the first is a short film which is a project she was working on at the time of her death and the second part is an in depth and candid interview which was also filmed in 2019. It is heartbreaking to watch as you can clearly see what a fragile soul she was and how the online bullying may not have been a direct cause for her decision it may well have contributed. The world would be a better place if she was still in it.",False

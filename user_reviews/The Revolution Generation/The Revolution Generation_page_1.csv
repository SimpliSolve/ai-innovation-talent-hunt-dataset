Directors Joshua Tickell and Rebecca Harrell Tickell, creators of Kiss The Ground, have done it again with this brilliant and moving film. Touching upon subjects of highly important matters such as the, #metoo movement, women's rights, environmental conservation, BLM, and other topics, this film is not afraid to speak out and stand up for what's right.

2,10,A Fantastic Portrayal Of Great Potentiality,spencerlevy-62652,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Revolution Generation: How Millennials Can Save America and the World is Joshua and Rebecca Tickell's latest masterpiece, and one that does not miss a single beat. Guided by the eloquent voice of narrator Michelle Rodriguez, The Revolution Generation takes you through a comprehensive rollercoaster of American history, showing how this history has informed the present and will inform the future. Through a lens of history's cyclical nature, it highlights the future's dependence on our youth and promotes their incredible potential to effect change through contemporary avenues. This stance is effectively reinforced through sobering and fascinating testimonies from activists Corbin Bleu and Shailene Woodley, who are repurposing their influence to inspire tremendous progress.

3,10,Uplifting Watch with a Rock Solid Thesis,kendrakrhi,n/a,15/08/2025,"The way that this film connects the idea of the ""Hero"" generation to social justice movements, specifically to the importance of climate action, is brilliant, and makes the thesis of the film- how millennials can save the world- rock solid. Starting the film off with the ideas of cyclical generational patterns and the designation of millennials as the newest ""Hero"" generation ties in just perfectly with the almost hopeless, world-ending perspective that most people have of modern crises today, specifically climate change. By identifying all of these major issues as something that millennials have been solving, the film beautifully asserts that Gen Y is fulfilling its ""Hero"" role by literally saving the world, whether that be by protesting systemic racism with the BLM movement, fighting for women's rights, or hosting massive climate demonstrations and marches in impacted areas. The activists and politicians featured within the film also bolster this assertion- Michelle Rodriguez gives a very balanced and down-to-earth performance as the film's witty narrator, and other interview subjects like Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, Shailene Woodley, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez each do wonders to keep the inspiration feel of the documentary high while conveying important information about the major issues they each cover, like climate change. The clear-cut nature of this thesis also serves as a buoy to keep the film grounded- both emotionally and in terms of keeping the narrative consistent. The idea that millennials are working actively to save the world runs through every aspect of the film, bringing a much-needed hopeful note to the serious topics it addresses that lingers long after the first watch.",False
4,9,Profound and Thought Provoking,wilsonbria,n/a,15/08/2025,"Directors Joshua Tickell and Rebecca Harrell Tickell did an incredible job with The Revolution Generation: How Millennials Can Save America and the World. Through the years millennials have been called everything from lazy to selfish. Over the course of this film I was amazed at how much I didn't know about millennials. The Revolution Generation opens your eyes to many things that before watching you wouldn't even be open to knowing. Getting Michelle Rodriguez to narrate was an inspired choice. As a millennial and woman she is a part of the story they are telling in the documentary. The Revolution Generation is all about reclaiming a nation's lost voice. The most interesting part of the film is how the Tickells are able to create a powerful dynamic between old and new information. Having information thrown at you can seem tedious but, The Revolution Generation finds a way that makes people want to learn more about each topic. They were also able to find relatability in adding in familiar faces like AOC, Shailene Woodley, and Corbin Bleu. Millennials know these faces, they trust these faces. These are the things that make a film relatable for an audience. When you go see a movie you want to be able to relate to it in some way. For documentaries adding in faces your target audience will know make that possible. The Revolution Generation makes sure to put an emphasis on the need for a spark to ignite change in today's society. Leaving the theater will make you feel like you could be that spark for yourself or someone else.",False

6,10,A paramount documentary standing as one more well-spoken leader in the ongoing fight for human and earthly rights.,lexifitzpatrick,n/a,15/08/2025,"A paramount documentary, covering a multitude of current events all circling one phenomena: the adulthood of the millennial. Josh and Rebecca Tickell's new documentary, The Revolution Generation: How Millennials Can Save America and the World, addresses the negative connotations of upcoming younger generations and uses history and evidence to offer concise, lucid rebuttals. It effectively proves how all of the traits allocated to millennials that have been deemed unworthy, are the key to the progression of the planet. A wide range of topics including social justice, student debt, climate control, and more amalgamate to form a cohesive story of a generation fighting with all that they have to create a world better than the one they grew up in. Metaphorical sound design brings to life the emotions of a generation; run and gun footage symbolizes the grit and hard work millennials are ready to put in; and top-tiered structuring brings together an explicit, successful argument. The Revolution Generation becomes one more well-spoken leader in the ongoing fight for human and earthly rights.",False

Their new film, Revolution Generation: How Millennials Can Save America and the World, is no exception. This is not just a film about millennials and the misconceptions behind them; it is a live-time documentation of the restructuring of the world. What do I mean by this? Well, according to the film, social, political, and historical change is coming and it is being propagated by millennials. Characterized by the ""Hero"" archetype by the Strauss-Howe Generational Theory, millennials are predicted to be the protector generation to be succeeded by Generation Z as the ""Artist"" generation which will bring progression after the Hero has conquered. I thoroughly enjoyed the wide range of areas covered in the film. From social change to environmental advocacy to political takeover to technological advancement, millennials have proved the necessity for youthful voices. The film also includes many notable faces such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Shailene Woodley, and Michelle Rodriguez to prove just how influential millennials have been when given a platform for social advocacy. As a young adult not only did I feel inspired by the documentary, but I felt heard. I definitely recommend this film!",False

The main focus is, of course, millennials, and what their role in this future is. By using historical analysis to break down the negative connation the word 'millennial' has, the directors effectively replace it with a more empowering and positive view of millennials. Various clips are shown in which millennials are actively fighting and putting themselves in adverse positions all for the support of their prospective causes. Most notably, Shailene Woodley is seen getting arrested for protesting the North Dakota Pipeline. With a passionate narration by Michelle Rodriguez, viewers can connect to the words being said and really gain a better knowledge of all the topics discussed.

13,10,Rethinking Our Past and Shifting Our Future's Paradigm,kalabxa,n/a,15/08/2025,"Joshua and Rebecca Tickell's new documentary The Revolution Generation: How Millennials Can Save America and the World is a reviving solution to all of our society's current crises, rethinking our past and shifting the paradigm of our future.

14,10,Entertainingly insightful!,sgp-89191,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watching Revolution Generation was the most entertaining media I have seen to showcase the true qualities of the millennial generation. To be frank, I have only ever seen millennials depicted in a very negative light and this is touched on by Directors Josh and Rebecca Tickell very early on. Narrator Michelle Rodriguez highlights the common misconceptions of this generation in an enticingly refreshing manner including her own personal anecdotes as she is also considered a millennial. Michelle is exceptionally entertaining in this task as she speaks of the struggles she faced growing up in a world seemingly destined to burn, while the previous ""nomad"" generation of the 1960s-1980s judged from afar. Her story is only one among the many included in this film of millennials who have struggled in adulthood and what it means to be a functioning member of society. Throughout the film, the Tickells deliberately chose to highlight the current issues going on in the world and their cyclical nature. As depicted in the film, there seems to be 4 ""turnings"" of generations and each new one comes with their own archetype. The directors also did well in this aspect by making the historical explanation of human nature equal parts informative and interesting. In this last turning, we have our ""heroic"" millennials, and it just so turns out that they live up to the 80-year theory. Politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and activist Shailene Woodley are utilizing their current positions and influence to help change the world. Revolution Generation is a film that encourages all to see hope, because millennials are the heroes of this generation. It makes you want to be a hero too.",False
15,9,An Emphatic Call to Action,mladenisabelle,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Revolution Generation: How Millennials Can Save America and the World, like the youth movements they depict, is unapologetic, bombastic, and impactful. Directors Josh and Rebecca Tickell of Kiss the Ground once again capture the urgency of our societal situation in another call to action, a loud siren demanding attention towards this world's grave injustices and the young people fighting against them. The extended adolescence of millennials has cultivated their negative stereotype of being immature and inactive - which the Tickells prove cannot be further from the truth. Their responses to these claims are explicated with cogent references to historical trends and sociological tendencies. They conclude that millennials react to their crumbling world in the most natural way imaginable. The youth's reaction could even be called extraordinary as they take the initiative to fight for racial, economic, and gender equality under the global threat of climate change. The commanding voice of the people is embodied by Michelle Rodriguez's narration and echoed by the many prominent interviewees such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Corbin Bleu, and Shailene Woodley. By the end of the film, all the members of this great chant are working together to motivate the young viewership to join them in their organizations to work towards a better future.",False
16,10,A Brilliant Testament to Unity,emmaludurand,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Revolution Generation: How Millennials Can Save America and the World paints a refreshingly positive image of the potential our younger generations hold. Delving into historical events and the patterns they reveal, directors Joshua and Rebecca Tickell creatively bring viewers down the timeline of sociocultural movements and the faces behind them, with the inevitable focus being brought back to the people of today. Expanding on ideas of current events, the film explores all facets of the factors that influence our government as well as the way current-day activism continues to challenge them. With a focus on environmental restoration, the Revolution Generation paves the way for thought and challenges its viewers to be the change they want to see in the world, something it does with the assurance that doing so will incite ripples of positive change just as it historically has proven to do. Moreover, it makes the case for the unification of individuals as the backbone of this change. The film is backed by some of the most influential current voices for social and political change, though, as the piece reveals, the most powerful ones yet come from the fusion of those of us who are watching.",False
17,10,A Triumph for the Millennial Generation,jasmineloriz,n/a,15/08/2025,"After creating their iconic environmental documentary, Kiss the Ground, the talented directing duo Rebecca and Josh Tickell have returned with another extraordinary documentary, The Revolution Generation: How Millennials Can Save America and the World, which examines and addresses the negative stereotypes surrounding millennials and presents how millennials are fighting back against these false perceptions. The film presents the archetypes of generations that have occurred cyclically throughout history. According to this cycle, baby boomers fall under the prophet archetype, generation x falls into the nomad archetype, and millennials are destined to become the next hero archetype. Due to these turnings, that means that millennials have incidentally fallen on the cusp of a crisis, and are forced to reckon with how to overcome and move forward. There is then a fluid transition into comparing the idyllic childhood that most millennials experienced and the future they were promised to the stark reality that they face. Between the insurmountable student debt rates, subpar living wages for working-class citizens, and the crash of the housing market, the state of society that was handed off to millennials when they came of age was less than fair. But rather than buckling under the pressure, we are shown an array of millennials who rose to the challenge and decided to take action into their own hands to fight for a better future. We hear from influential celebrities like Shailene Woodley, Corbin Bleu, Jennifer Lawrence, and Michelle Rodriguez, who narrates through the turmoils and triumphs of her generation. We also hear from notable political leaders and activists who are part of the millennial generation like Christin ""Cici"" Battle, Chase Iron Eyes, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on how they fight to be the change they want to see. Though this documentary covers many themes and social causes, like social justice, gender equality, lgbtq+ rights, and climate change, it does so seamlessly with the background of progressiveness and change unifying all these causes together. Revolution Generation is a documentary that not only begs us to reflect and have love for humankind but also to take a stand and fight for what we believe in. I was wholly invigorated and enamored by this film, as it deserves an abundance of praise for moving the audience to bear witness and be the change we need.",False
18,10,The Spark of Hope for Our Future,serenakline,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Revolution Generation: How Millenials Can Save America and the World takes an honest stance against the polarizing narratives that lead Americans to work against each other. The Directors, Josh Tickell and Rebecca Harrell Tickell are creators of other impactful documentaries Like Kiss the Ground as they continue to spread the message that change needs to come and fast. The film exposes past generations' ideals and promises and how those systems have failed the new generations. The film covers topics like student debt, #BLM, Native American rights, and the #MeToo movement. The Revolution Generation shows how the youngest generations hold the key to bringing on the change that has to happen. The film features young activists like Greta Thunberg as she spoke at the climate summit and shows several grassroots organizers working within their community to create movements. Michelle Rodriguez narrates and takes us through the previous generations showing how change and corruption developed in cycles called the four turnings. This film has predictive power but paints a hopeful picture empowering viewers to take action to grab the future they want to see. Revolution Generation shows that the change that we need won't happen unless we work together.",False
19,9,A Demonstration of Understanding and Humanity,meganredhills,n/a,15/08/2025,"Increasingly topical and impressively in-depth with its research, analysis, and documentation of the world of activism and the negative stigmas that surround the millennial generation that holds major numbers within it, the Revolution Generation: How Millennials Can Save America and the World delivers on a film that both empowers and educates its viewers. Directing team Joshua Tickell and Rebecca Harrell Tickell seek to put an explanation to the common and tired stereotypes that claim millennials to be lazy or entitled and do so by confronting the sociological perceptions that shape the personas and interactions of each generation, commenting on the financial and political crises of the 21st century that have put many within the millennial generation in debt or states of pessimism towards society. Interesting enough on its own, the Tickell's go beyond this to document the astonishing and inspiring amount of millennials who refute these claims, specifically those who have given themselves and their voices to activist causes and political spheres to better shape the world themselves, no longer willing to wait for their older generations to fix their own messes. It's not just a documentary that advocates for the significance of the millennial generation, but it is one that seeks to highlight the human desire to help one another and improve the lives of future generations, desires that represent the millennial generation tenfold. Speaking with millennial political and activist leaders such as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, Shailene Woodley, Chase Iron Eyes, Michelle Rodriguez, who strongly and passionately narrates the film, and many more, Revolution Generation keeps an attentive and dedicated focus and appreciation to its subject matter, holding the weighty subjects of generational divides and social justice in the respect and care they need. This film is wonderful for those interested in activist documentaries but is even better for those who wish to learn more about the systemic and sociological conditions that shape the lives and minds of a generation, something that is as fascinating as it is thought-provoking.",False

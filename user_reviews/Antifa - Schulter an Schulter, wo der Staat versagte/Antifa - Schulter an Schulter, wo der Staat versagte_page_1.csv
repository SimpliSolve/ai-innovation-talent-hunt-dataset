1,n/a,An extraordinarily thrilling documentary film,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"In contrast to the ""remigrations"" dude who wrote a ""review"" here. The movie offers fascinating insights into a scene that was previously closed to the public. The film also contains a surprising amount of interesting archive material, much of which was previously unpublished or not openly accessible.Anyone expecting a blunt film about violence will be disappointed. It is a reflective, cleverly realized film that gives you energy for future challenges.The protagonists are skillfully chosen. Although there are only five people, they represent a wide range of perspectives and worlds of experience, big city, village, north-south, east-west and so on. All in all, a real insider tip.",False
2,5,How to make a cinema movie with a few anectotes and half an hour of archive material.,innereemigration,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went into this movie thinking the protagonists would at least have some cool stories about doing antifa work in the 90ies, especially in Eastern Germany and seeing some interesting unreleased archive material of the time. But all they talk about are common tropes that everyone at least in the left already knows about. The archive material is mostly of demonstrations with a few burning cars here and there. I don't understand that someone thought: yeah we can make a 90min movie with that. It would have been a cool 30 minute youtube video.One of the guys even says in the movie that there isn't a lot of material from the time because antifa wasn't to keen on people filming demonstrations. There were right. No know needs 'Demofotografen' to take pictures only to make a boring movie 30 years later.Edit: in response to the reviewer who accused me of being far right: my username is innere emigration which is a term that describes leftists who were opposed to the ns regime. It has nothing to do with remigration and your're an idiot.",False

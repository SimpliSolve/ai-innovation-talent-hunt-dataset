1,8,A state of mind,all-077,n/a,16/08/2025,"Inoxtag is a famous French YouTuber with several million subscribers who, one day, realizes his disastrous daily life and decides to change it.To do this, he sets out to achieve his dream: climbing Everest. His life over the course of a year is documented with humor, tears, challenges, and powerful human relationships that change us just as they changed Inoxtag.This beautifully edited film shows us that no matter our dreams, we can still move forward.But this ascent of the highest mountain isn't the focus of the film; Kaizen is a life philosophy in its own right, pushing us to discover new things and improve ourselves day after day, ultimately discovering what ""real life"" is.",False
2,9,Very inspiring,ahmedbentaher-16223,n/a,16/08/2025,"The narrative flow keeps you engaged from start to finish, and the attention to detail in the storytelling is exceptional. Every shot feels purposeful, and you can tell the director had a clear vision throughout the process. The way Kaisen balances the raw reality of the challenges with moments of triumph is truly inspiring.The editing also deserves special mention-it's seamless, and the pacing is perfect, allowing the story to unfold naturally while keeping the viewer hooked. The music choices complement the visuals beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of the journey.Overall, Kaisen sets a new standard for YouTubers looking to dive into the world of documentary filmmaking. It's not just a project; it's a masterpiece of dedication, skill, and passion. Anyone aspiring to create their own documentary will have to contend with the high bar this one has set.",False

4,5,Too cheesy for what it is,cmmedland,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love climbing documentaries and this was by far the hardest one to watch. I'm not sure if it's the film that's trying too hard or Ines that's trying too hard to be inspirational but in the end, the film as a whole just tries too hard. It might even just be the English dub version that overdoes it. While the feat is impressive to say the least, I feel like there was some fabricated obstacle drama involved. One moment on one of their training climbs on a different peak, they're absolutely sure that they can't continue. They have no energy and they're moving too slow. The next moment, they're suddenly inspired and achieving the impossible (that was completely possible). I nearly turned it off before they actually started the eventual Everest ascent. I gave it 5/10 stars but really might change that to 4/10.",False

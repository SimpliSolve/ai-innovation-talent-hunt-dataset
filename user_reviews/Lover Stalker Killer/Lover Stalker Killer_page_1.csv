1,8,Wild turn of events!,BlackSandRedMoon,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's an interesting documentary that explores a severe case of stalking to the point that if it were a movie, it would be hard to believe. It also illustrates the dangers of online dating, where you never know the true personality of a person. Although it took a long time to solve, the authorities working on the case did a great job, especially the tech expert who dedicated himself so much that he refused to have brain surgery until he solved the case. He was the main reason the case was solved. The documentary is engaging, with many interesting twists and turns that I won't talk about to avoid giving spoilers, but I do recommend watching it.",False
2,8,Worth watching,chopperDavo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I rate this documentary. It's well worth your time to watch.Maybe I watch too much true crime, but I could see fairly early on who the culprit was. And so I was kind of waiting for them to reveal that.And so it moved a little slowly in that regard. The film makers filled in the details one by one towards the end. Things like the missing car, untouched bank accounts etc.There were a few unanswered questions such as how the offender kept their digital ID untraceable for so long. How did they gain entry to properties? What happened to the gun?I came away feeling very sorry for the male victim. He was put through the ringer. He seems like a decent guy.",False
3,7,Frustrating,townlinetoads,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOthers have mentioned some frustrating things about this documentary, mainly concerning the slow pace of investigation and lack of awareness on Dave's part, so I won't really get into those things. But no one has mentioned that in this ""small town"" people, including Dave, believed a woman was able to relentlessly stalk a bunch of people in town for YEARS yet NEVER be seen herself...and nobody, including police, found that unbelievable?! And after EVERYTHING, Dave's apartment is broken into and his gun is stolen...after EVERYTHING, all the THREATS and craziness & he didn't have any sort of SECURITY in his apartment?!! I also don't understand why several people said, of Liz, something along the lines of ""she burned her own house down, so just imagine what she might be capable of!"" without mentioning the fact that she BURNED HER OWN PETS ALIVE, it was kind of glossed over (only mentioned when it happened supposedly at the hands of Cari). I think such a heinous act deserved some mention in regards to how truly DEPRAVED that Liz was. I rated this a 7 because it was interesting and fairly well made. The frustration I felt did not enter into my rating, I just wanted to come on here and vent!",True
4,7,Better than average but....,mamet-94713,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is actually better than most Netflix crime documentaries.For one it doesn't have several useless episodes with information that keeps on repeating in order to fill the time. It's a relatively zippy 1h30 and there is very little filler.I've got three qualms about this that keeps me from giving it a higher rating.1- If I could figure out within 15 minutes what was going on how come the first cops couldn't? There's no information about the cops' ineptitude in handling the initial case.2- The prosecutor says this will be a hard case to prove, no slam dunk etc. And then the film makers spend all of two minutes on the actual court case. That's shoddy film making.3- What was the perpetrators motives? The mindset etc. Nothing was explained or explored and that made for a less than compelling ending.Netflix almost knocked it out of the park with this one.",False
5,7,Good.,kenbo-87360,n/a,16/08/2025,"A good watch for all the wrong reasons. A love triangle goes drastically wrong. Firstly I think I watch too many TV shows and too many crime documentaries, because I guessed exactly how all of this would unfold, almost to the minute details. That didn't take anything away from the film though.Man goes on date with woman. He then dates another woman. Woman becomes scorned and unleashes hell on said man. That's pretty much a short, brief summary.You do find yourself asking questions. Why couldn't the police get to the bottom of it much quicker? We all know how easy it is for law enforcement to track people, or ISP addresses. I feel it should never have got to the stage it did do.Overall a good watch though for true crime fans. Give it a try.",False
6,7,"Good, but definitely not great",akg1249,n/a,16/08/2025,"It really breaks my mind that the investigators in this true crime case took more than 3 years to solve what took me a paltry 15 minutes. Believe me, it is all too easy to deduce and too obvious. I am even a bit angry at the primary victim, Dave Kroupa, for not figuring it out himself. And this is not the first true crime documentary either where investigators are seen doing a lazy and unimaginative job. The events unfolded in 2012 and not in 1912. Electronic surveillance technology was easily available back then and it's shocking that none of the cops thought of using it. Incredibly, it took a set of new detectives and 3 years of head banging by the Omaha P. D. to conclude that the investigation ""needed an IT guy"", especially when the entire volume of evidence in the case was digital in nature. It is absolutely nuts and revolting.The documentary was well-organized and maintained a good pace, similar to many of Netflix's true crime documentaries. A notable addition in this documentary was the eerie background score, which, combined with the dark color tones, helped in sustaining a macabre environment throughout.The twist in the case is not as far-fetched as the investigators made it appear. I'm sure many viewers would have felt the same as I. So, be ready to be disappointed in that respect. I also felt that the documentary fast-forwarded things a bit too quickly between arresting the perp and the court delivering the verdict.I like this production and rank it as GOOD and WATCHABLE. I enjoyed it but am not too impressed by it. I don't know what Rotten Tomatoes' 100% ratings are about.",False
7,8,Caught my interest from the start!,nikitacpv,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm the type of person that sees something interesting on Netflix, I check what it is about watch the trailer and add it to my list, to then never watch it. On some very rare occasions I watch it immediately, like this one.I was hooked from the start, unfortunately as I had an early morning the next day I had to watch it in two parts but I was so dragged into this story that I couldn't stop thinking about it.My partner had it right from the start about how the events were gonna turn out, and I must say I should have seen it coming.The documentary is filmed in a great way, it all comes together without losing the viewer and confusing us. It's disturbing to realise that this is how some people live and sad how the family of those around all get affected.",False
8,7,Engaging,Kingslaay,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was quite engaged by this doco. It got more bizarre and crazy as time went on. I had my suspicious and felt I called it from the start. It was a simple case, nothing too complicated and the producers do well with the subject matter and make a decent production.If anything, this really was a case of bad policework. Very poor detective work from the start led to this series of terrible events because the true story and some common sense was always there. If some basic things were actually looked into this would have not taken years. I thought it was complicated only to find out it was the obvious suspect. Overall not a bad doco and an easy watch.",False
9,8,Ohhh THe Insanity,jdevine-89140,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was a crazy stalking case with a twist. Now the twist seemed fairly obvious to me very early on but nonetheless the utter insanity of the perp was enough to keep me watching in the hope that they would be brought to justice. Now, if I can figure the twist so early (I aint no Sherlock) then I cannot understand how the original police investigation so utterly failed to even consider the possibility. Personally I have been the object of a stalkers attention and let me tell you their relentlessness is almost impossible to comprehend. How can somebody be so utterly dedicated and thorough?! They are real world Terminators. They cant be bargained with, they don't feel sympathy and they will not stop ever until you or they are dead (or in this case captured). This is the most acute stalking case I've ever seen and its craziness alone is worth the watch.",True
10,7,Truth is crazier than reality,trishdclark,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis story is crazy. Twisted for sure! Like many others on here I figured it out as soon as Liz interrupted Cari's date with Dave.A woman murdered for absolutely no reason other than pure jealousy. Animals died, children lost their home and belongings in a fire. (And then their mom was put in prison for life) A man was tormented for years, left depressed and nearly pushed to paranoia or worse. An ex-wife and children also tormented and fearing for their lives. For what? A few nights of rolling around in the sheets? Poor Dave didn't even know this psycho long either to fart in front of her. How does a deranged, mentally ill, monster form that fast? She's had to have done this in past relationships. It just doesn't make sense! Poor Cari, a completely innocent, kind and happy, loving mother that didn't deserve this fate. Who knows what she had to go through. And her poor family, worried, not knowing where she was, if these lies were true. Her father passing, not knowing. Her poor son must have just felt abandoned. I hope Liz rots in hell for all the lives (at least 15) affected by her sick actions!!!This was a good doc, but so many missing pieces. This could have been solved so much sooner if it was taken seriously by the original detectives.1. Why wouldn't Dave question the sudden change in Cari or follow up with her at least in person? He said he really liked her? If I got odd, rude and threatening texts from someone, completely out of character, I would want answers, or validation.2. Why after they found Cari's car didn't they do a complete forensics search of the car? Check for blood, fingerprints, look for camera's to see who dropped the car off there? Anything to help find her as a missing person? Sounds like they half-assed it.3. Who the hell was paying Cari's rent or mortgage this whole time if her house was never cleaned out? If they did a true welfare check they would have seen she didn't take anything, when she supposedly ""moved"" to Kansas. Red flag detectives!4. After the fire at Liz's, did they get an alibi for Liz? Check her body or cloths for accelerant? Did she stand to gain insurance money? She was the only one at the scene and it should have been processed. (Regardless of texts) So demented, who kills their own family pets in a fire?5. When Liz shot herself in the leg, did they test her hand/glove for gunshot residue? Did they examine the trajectory of the gunshot wound? Seems like they could have seen it was self inflicted. Did they even search for a gun in the area, because at this time they already suspected her. They should have searched her home too. Or validated the ammunition was the same kind that Dave had in his gun. (All this to help strengthen the case at trial)6. Once they knew it was Liz doing all of this, why didn't they arrest her for arson? At least get her off the streets, while they investigate the murders.Not sure why there was such little time given for the trial. Especially since they said it would be a hard one to win. I feel this should have received at least 30 mins of the doc to complete this story better. It was just glazed over. That judge was a total prick, basically trying to ""gotcha"" the verdict. Making it seem like it was not guilty, then guilty. Who does that, especially in this case? Cari's poor family tormented again by the judge.I praise the detectives and IT tech guy that finally got it right on this case. They worked so hard and even held off surgery, to see this through. Sadly the earlier detectives really dropped the ball here. I hope the one detective was able to mend his relationships with his family, and the IT Tech recovered nicely from his brain surgery.This is a definite watch from me, all said and done.",True
11,10,Wow!,anastasiaconstantinou,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was hooked from the start on this true crime documentary. It was different to the majority lover, stalker, killer documaries in that this time you saw the male subject being stalked by the female.What it does also proove is that a woman scorned is not to be messed with as she is imaginative, dangerous and very cunning.For true crime buffs this documentary will be above the rest as there are so many twists and turns due to the psychotic but very intelligent stalker.But like all Netflix true crime docos the ending is always the same. The bad guy/girl gets caught no matter how smart they think that they are.",False
12,7,Justice only half done,voodoomada,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA beautifully made film, but a policeman who was the occasional lover of the criminal appears very little in the related story. It is as obvious as can be that he is involved in the murder. The criminal could not have sent those messages and concealed their source to the extent she did, or concealed the crime she committed so meticulously without the help of that cop she was hanging out with. .
In my opinion, only part of the truth came out, the policeman being protected by his colleagues. Justice only half done.By the way, I knew from the first moment who the murderer was. Were the first squad of cops retarded, or were they protecting someone?",True
13,2,Poor editing made the twist painfully obvious,brogan_pierce,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love a weird true crime documentary and had read all the reviews about how shocking the twist was here, so was very excited for this. Under 5 minutes in, I said out loud ""so obviously xyz has happened... surely that's not the twist that everyone is talking about?!"". Unfortunately, it was - the editing here made the ""twist"" painfully obvious and it was agonising to have to wait another hour to see the investigating officers finally unveil what we'd worked out from the first scene. Such a shame, as it's truly a terrible case! It also felt like the true victim of this case was severely pushed into the background here and almost forgotten about. I wouldn't bother recommending!",False
14,7,N/A,d_penn,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're a true crime fan, the Netflix original, ""Lover, Stalker, Killer,"" is for you. The film follows the true story of Dave Kroupa and his experience with a former lover turned psychotic stalker in the early 2010s. The release was directed by Sam Hobkinson and premiered Friday, Feb. 9, quickly overtaking first place in ""Movies Today"" on Netflix the day of its release. The plot consists heavily of twists and turns. Whenever an outcome seems obvious, it is debunked within the next few scenes.Kroupa initially met his offender through a dating app, which is where the obsessive behavior sparks. The story is retold through interviews with Kroupa, his ex-wife and law enforcement officials who worked on the case. This is paired with evidence, photos, videos and reenactment scenes in which Kroupa makes an appearance by playing himself, making the story easy to follow. The combination of film and documentary styles makes the storyline engaging for audiences. The storytelling is strong with the use of flashbacks that recreate specific scenarios.A unique aspect of the film that is uncommon for documentaries is the insight into other characters' lives. The detectives speak about their life experiences during the period outside of their work. This gives the understanding that these are real people balancing life and an excruciating four year long investigation.From a production standpoint, the film suffers from over-dramatized music and lighting. Yet, I would argue that it fits the narrative and the emotion it attempts to evoke. This kind of cinematic value also grasps audiences and makes a documentary alluring. The plot may be predictable for some, but the creative narration diverts your imagination from figuring it out through intentional storytelling. In addition, the film emphasizes certain characters to confuse audiences. Descriptions of people cue hints as to their motives, but nothing is quite verified until the ending. The constant switch between various accusations makes viewers question the underlying tone of every line of dialogue. It is evident that regardless of what characters say they believed at the time, the answer won't be clear until the final minutes of the documentary. This build-up captivates audiences and helps them better understand the confusing leads detectives deal with.For those unsure if they can stomach a documentary like this, it's not visually graphic, although disturbing events are described. Alongside this, it's always a bit uncomfortable to know something like this occurred not too long ago. I am someone who loves thrillers with the understanding that they're fiction. True crime such as this can instill a fear of the horrific realities in the world. The depths at which the perpetrator submits to terrorize Kroupa are terrifying. The number of innocent people affected by this tragedy is truly heartbreaking. The film doubles as an eye-opener to the inner workings of criminals as well as entertainment. Likewise, the film shows how expanding technologies can damage society's safety and ease the ability of people to get away with crimes. Viewers may need to think twice before using their beloved dating apps and trusting strangers.",False

After two weeks a man's ex-girlfriend becomes a living nightmare for him and the people he cares about. The escalation of behavior rivals any fictional, Fatal Attraction movie, you will ever see.

17,7,"Lover, Stalker, Killer proves to be an engaging stalker tale and an above-average documentary",kevin_robbins,n/a,16/08/2025,"I recently viewed the documentary Lover, Stalker, Killer (2024) on Netflix. The narrative centers around a recently divorced father who, after relocating closer to his children, embarks on a new life that includes a dating app. As he becomes entangled with a couple of women, the situation spirals out of control. The emergence of intense stalking leaves him fearing for his life and the safety of his loved ones, especially as the stalking reaches alarming levels.Directed by Sam Hobkinson (Misha and the Wolves), this docuseries offers a unique stalker tale with enjoyable twists and turns. While I predicted the outcome early on, the story unfolds with entertaining details. The overall narrative carries a somber tone, portraying the ruin of several lives in this distinctive love triangle.In conclusion, Lover, Stalker, Killer proves to be an engaging stalker tale and an above-average documentary. I would give it a 7/10 and recommend watching it once.",False
18,9,Truth stranger than fiction? Fiction doesn't come close to this truth.,cmconnexion,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rarely is there a documentary that will take you on the most unpredictable journey of a police investigation. The evolution of this case as detectives and forensics peel away the layers only to be thrown into a completely different direction is, for lack of a better word, simply ""incredible.""A lonely man named Tony, looking for female company is bombarded, harassed and threatened via text messages from an ex-girlfriend. She knows his everything he does, where he goes, and who he's with every second of the day. The abuse is horrifying and relentless. The problem is, nobody knows where this woman is. Then the threats extend beyond Tony to his current girlfriend and her children. Vandalism. Arson. Threats, Murder? Tony is living a nightmare.My one observation is that had the victim of stalking not been a man, and the perpetrator not been a woman, action by law enforcement (dare I say) would likely to have been taken a little more seriously at the beginning, and may had resulted in solving the case much earlier. It's as if poor Tony was left twisting in the wind. Stalking is a serious matter for anyone.That being said, the investigators were deft and strategic. Applying both physical and digital technologies in forensics, as well as psychology, coding, and the laborious tasks of reviewing and revisiting the thousands of photos and IP addresses in evidence is a testament to these three men's endurance and patience. Their professional dedication in finding justice came at considerable personal cost.If this were fiction, then there would be a Hollywood ending, tying off all the loose ends. This isn't a movie, and unfortunately, there are still stones left unturned and people still unavenged.This is one of the rare exceptions where truth is not only stranger than fiction, fiction couldn't come close to this truth.Highly Recommended!",False
19,6,"Another ""twisted"" instance of Netflix serving its true-crime audiences! [+60%]",arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLet's get this out of the way first - there are a couple of twists here that are hard to see coming, given the way the proceedings play out and only the interference of modern tech and some brainy people could have made a difference. This is a story of online dating gone W-I-L-D in the early 2010s, and it felt incredibly difficult to take sides in this case, at least initially.. and I'll tell you why. For starters, the no-strings-attached guy was so quick to get back on the dating platform right after he'd been through a life-threatening situation that happened due to someone he met virtually. If it were me, I'd just delete the whole thing altogether and vanish from the digital space forever (..which is way easier to do than to deal with crazy stalkers for years). Also, the piece wants to keep you on edge, so the distancing feels somewhat intentional.The re-enactments, while giving you visual insights, go somewhat overboard in the latter acts of the piece, making them a tad too cinematic for my liking. I also began to wonder early on why one of the ""supposed"" victims wasn't extensively interviewed, but I got my answer as we moved into the second act. Thanks to a trio of ""good guys"", the real criminal is brought to justice in a fantastic instance of (ethical?) bait & wait. It also justified the presence of the real victim's mother, giving her the space to redeem her daughter's reputation. Happy for her. Netflix is seriously exploring all of these crazy stories from the past few decades in the hope of keeping its true-crime category relevant. I'd say it's working to some extent.",True
20,10,Unbelieveable,hasnainfarid,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI felt very saddened for Cari who has passed away; it was deeply distressing to see an innocent life being lost. This world is a place of sorrows, and this entire story caused great anguish. However, the work that the police did, I mean the way they did it, man, huge huge respect. I mean, they are real-life heroes, they should receive the highest civilian honors. Look at the person who ignored his tumor for the sake of this case, and how they worked day and night to solve it. On the other hand, it's hard to decide whether to cry or be happy about Liz's sentence, what her psychological state was like, I mean, can someone really do that? Very strange. Love and jealousy can make a person do anything. All in all, it was beautifully directed, beautifully produced, all the crew behind it deserve utmost respect. Man, this was huge. Learnt a lot from it..",True

Really boring documentary and unnecessary long. All the history can be explained in 10 minutes top. It does not make any sense that a documentary that has to demand your attention all the time, became a boring explanation of facts that were foretold since the beginning.

And I understand that stalking this guy and his ex-wife must be a horrifying situation. But in this documentary Dave Krupa presents himself as the super victim, but let's not forget that Cari Farver, her mother who lost a daughter and her son who lost a mother are the real victims here. And that sort of gets in the background. Dave Krupa should have known better than to let this monster of a woman into his life again and again. So - again - my heart goes out to Cari...and Dave Krupa - enjoy your fame.",True

Because of this, at times it dragged on. And some of the police work was so sloppy it's barely credible.On the good side, towards the end when they got it together, it was fascinating, esp the guy who wrote the program and how he used it to sort the data. Also, the police interview with her was kind of gripping.Finally, on the meh side, Dave wasn't an idea lead. They can't do much about that, though. He wasn't a bad guy, and it was cool he moved there to be with his kids, but let's just say brains aren't his strong suit.",True

The description makes it seem like a bit of love triangle gone wrong, which is vaguely correct but it's clearly a really distressing 'wrong place, wrong time' and incredibly unlucky for the victims involved. Liz is the unexpected suspect, who goes to great lengths such as burning her house down which subsequently kills her own pets, shooting herself and keying her own car, all to frame Dave's ex wife. She clearly was very methodical with the murder as the body wasn't discovered but her logic when trying to frame Amy (Dave's ex wife) walked right into the trap set by the honourable police department who spent countless hours by the sound of it making sure the justice was served in this case.",True
25,9,"Actually Painful To Watch, & Should Be",AudioFileZ,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCouples with children that are divorced are, sadly, an everyday occurrence. Usually the best case scenario is when the couple stays civil, even caring, especially for the sake of their children. In this case the ex-husband cares to move to the state where his ex relocated with their children to remain a close father. This should have been a good thing for all. It wasn't. It set up a long chain of most unbelievable events involving mental harassment and murder. Dave, the father, got a new job close to his ex and kids which took a turn for the worse when he began a new relationship with a woman named Liz. Liz was independent having her own cleaning business and had some mutual interests which seemed to suit Dave who wasn't looking to settle down any time soon. What seemed innocuous enough was anything but.Stalking and harassment cases sometimes aren't as cut and dried as other criminal acts. Especially when some very real cloak and dagger methodology is employed. In this case it involved texts and emails, thousands of them, using a myriad of fake IP addresses. In time it would get past the point of threats with physical criminal acts. But from who? A person that was reported as missing who early police investigators shrugged off because she couldn't be located. Shouldn't this ramp things up to a boil? Apparently not. Early on there was zero attempts, at least as documented here, by police to apply digital forensics to the only leads they had, those texts and emails. Is this good detective work? Far from it seemingly, as hundreds ever more threatening texts and criminal acts played out. Dave, his ex, and children's lives were being totally ruined with fear for their lives.It takes a smaller Sheriff's department with a core of three very dedicated officers to break the case. A case that could have been cracked much earlier if the initial police department had made it a priority. The perpetrator was, perhaps, deemed as an unsophisticated cleaning person not capable of a long-term campaign of digital and worse criminality. Initially, just as she elaborately schemed, she was a victim too as far as that first police department roundly accepted. This changed as the three officers working the case in that small Sheriff's department were certain the author of all of this evil was not who it seemed. In fact, they were sure the supposed text and email author was very much dead. From there they knew who to truly look at. This case took far too long to break as it harmed lives irreparably in the interim. A sense of these innocent people's sorrow hangs heavily as such. It absolutely makes this a hard crime documentary to watch. It should too as law enforcement should be far more sophisticated and involved as seen in the earlier years here. That small Sheriff's department with the three amazing officers are true heroes who should be lauded for their dogged dedication and work. They serve as a shining examples of the best of their craft.I've been heavy on the story, but the way it's presented here it seems too real not to be discussed. The producers of this documentary takes the viewer on a very deep and disturbing ride genuinely exposing evil can be the person right next to you. It makes for an uneasy watch because even those who seem far from capable are actually very capable of the darkest of evil events. I have to call this a very interesting and well done expose of the darkest parts of humanity. Thankfully, our three heroes offer some much needed light which I believe anyone watching welcomes.",True

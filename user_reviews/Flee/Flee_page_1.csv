1,8,The Odyssey of Amin...,Xstal,n/a,15/08/2025,"A far too familiar tale of persecution and corruption, as Amin generously reveals the trials and torments that saw him and his family flee Kabul because of victimisation, alongside his personal story that saw him make a life in Denmark and how he's been able to live his life the way he wishes, with who he wants - heart wrenching stuff indeed.",False
2,9,Left Me Speechless,sweidman-28016,n/a,15/08/2025,"At this point it's going to be so hard to top Flee. It tells the extraordinary true story of a man, Amin, on the verge of marriage which compels him to reveal his hidden past for the first time. Rather than a typical documentary style, it goes for an animated approach in the for of mockumentary. Never does it feel like a documentary which is extraordinary. The animation is simplistic yet looks so dynamic. It also blends archive footage to remind us the realness of it all. The story is tragic and amazing. We're told of Amin's experience fleeing country to country in hopes for a better life. It's a thrilling ride from start to finish. I'm not sure how anyone couldn't like it. This is the best of the festival and one of the best of the year!",False
3,8,A Fantastic Use of Animation,jordyntsmith,n/a,15/08/2025,"The partially animated documentary-story of a man who secretly escaped Afghanistan as a child.I enjoyed this film more than I thought it would, and I am so happy to find that animation can succeed in this form of storytelling. Though the animation can be quite limited at times, it is more than adept and able to communicate the raw emotion behind many of the stories, maybe even more so than it's real-life counterparts could.It is a film almost everyone should watch - just to see life through another person's eyes.",False
4,n/a,Masterful docu-animation. Look for it at Oscar time.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fleeing Taliban's Afghanistan in the latter part of the last century would seem the proper subject for film or video, capturing the reality of flight from oppression to freedom. Actually, in Flee, a documentary-animation with shades of color and earth tones works even better because the reality is in the narration of unspeakable horrors lived by protagonist Amin Nowabi at several stages of his life and experienced by the viewer not distracted by film's visual reality.Amin's quarter-century friendship with director Jonas Poher Rasmussen helps him confess honestly to the single camera about long suppressed hurt. The animation objectively captures the pain he suffers recounting the journey to freedom and recapturing his love of life.Young Amin travels with his mother, brother, and two sisters with unscrupulous traffickers and corrupt police for months to arrive in freedom physically and psychologically damaged, separated from each other for years to come. The narration is impeccably understated as it lets the story collect the audience's grief and pity out of the documentary's reality.Amin's story moves from idyllic, brightly lit youthful days in Kabul (similarly sketched in Kenneth Branagh's recollection of his youth in Belfast) through the darkly harrowing journey on land and sea to land his life finally now in Copenhagen, buying a house, and coming out with his partner to family and the world in a salutary note of hope for refugees everywhere at any time. The price has been enormous in lost lives and lost youth.All is not animation because interspersed is library footage of the Russian Afghanistan invasion and speeches by former President Mohammad Najibullah. Such reality checks make sure audience is not lulled into animation's chief compromiser-its own unreality.Amin himself may be experiencing fictionalized reminiscence even though events seem to reflet a terror that did happen and can only be imagined years later.Flee is a masterful amalgam of animation, real-live photography, and history recounted partially from a terrible journey's reality and a hero's struggling memory and imagination. You'll understand our collective confusion about Afghanistan and our abandoning it. You'll also understand if Flee is Oscar nominated in categories such as animation and international. It's all good.",False
5,9,Breathtaking,atractiveeyes,n/a,15/08/2025,"Denmark's official submission to 2022's Oscars is an amazing heartbreaking animated documentary. Its real story is extraordinary, sad, powerful and so moving. It's written brilliantly, with many deep lines. The animation is beautiful and original. I hope this film will get Oscar nominations for Best International Feature Film, Best Animation and Best Documentary.",False
6,10,Neon grabbed the Best Picture for an international film. Now they will give best picture to a documentary and an animated feature,JessicaCatrionaGray,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a simple yet shocking story that is INCREDIBLY well-told. Indeed, it is told in such a fashion that I've never experienced before (at least that I don't recall) - the animated documentary.It makes a lot of sense. Standard documentary procedure has the participants or experts telling their perspective into the camera. This is tried and true because there's real power in having people tell you their stories. It's fundamental to sentient beings and is one of our distinguishing marks as humans. Still, this storytelling may not give one the sense of BEING there.Animation - surprisingly - has the ability to do this. Because events can be recreated in exacting and stark details. And characters are no less human just because they're drawn. It helps that we're far past the time when anything animated is treated as cartoons and thus ""kids stuff"". Several decades of shows like The Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park will do that.From Afghanistan to Russia. From Russia to Copenhagen. From Copenhagen to Princeton and then back again. We follow the nomadic Amin who is often running for his very life. This movie isn't inherently political but... But it does make the case for the refugee. It's my perception that film lovers tend to be better at empathy and thus do not need to be convinced: ""Hey, what refugees go through really sucks and what little nations can do to help should be done."" But there are many who need to hear and understand that message. I wonder if they'll ever get the opportunity to see this film. Now that it's a Sundance Winner... Maybe.Although I might be a little hypocritical here. I've long had a bad impression of Russia and this movie didn't help that perception.In addition to fleeing from conflict in his home country, Amin is trying to outrun something that he can't. He's a homosexual from a devout Muslim country and those two things inherently don't mix. Despite this, this documentary isn't a ""gay"" movie... And I was a little stunned how this issue was resolved. If resolved is the right word. Those who have seen this movie will know what I'm referring to.

7,8,Powerful,Movi3DO,n/a,15/08/2025,"A semi-documentary about the journey of Amin, who fled from Afghanistan.First of all, I was surprised to see a documentary with animation style intermingled with real footages and sceneries. This style worked incredibly well because not only did it protect the identity of Amin, but also allow for beautiful visual crafting that elevated the emotion of Amin. Since Amin was mostly calm in his voice, the animation and footages helped conveying the stake and danger of the situation.The story itself was harrowing yet compelling. I love how the story revolved around family from beginning to end. As a person who came from a family of immigrants, family is always an important theme. Because of that, Amin's testimony did hit it home.Overall, an incredible story. 8/10.",False
8,10,from life under occupation to personal discovery,lee_eisenberg,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIf there's one Academy Award-nominated movie that you should really see this year, it's Jonas Poher Rasmussen's ""Flugt"" (""Flee"" in English). This animated documentary focuses on a man who spent his childhood first in Soviet-occupied Afghanistan, and then in post-Soviet Russia, before eventually making his way to Denmark and coming out as gay to his family.The documentary uses different types of animation to get its point across, while also incorporating live-action footage (i.e., Peter Jennings reporting on the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan). These topics have become all the more important now that the Taliban has seized power in Afghanistan again, and Russia has invaded Ukraine.Anyway, Amin's story is one of the most fascinating that I've ever heard (also one of the most gut-wrenching). It's not a movie that you'll forget any time soon.",True
9,6,Not as good as I expected,alewand,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerTo be honest the story isn't detailed enough and it seems a bit manipulative emotionally at times. It is however timely for sure. The biggest problem I had with this movie is that it is so eager to search for stereotypical drama that it leaves behind the tragedy like what it is really like being left in a foreign country by oneself as a teenager. The story doesn't really go there as it prefers building the false impression of tragedy around the siblings of the main character. We end up being stuck in a story between the tragedy of the adults that are left to their own devices in the foreign land and a story of a child that doesn't have any will on his own. The movie had its moments and the reality of the main character journey is horrifying but ultimately the movie lacks some pieces. Valtz in bashir or even the Breadwinner are far superior in my eyes. Also the animation style didn't really suit me though it is very subjective.,True
10,8,Powerful,PedroPires90,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very powerful portrait of a life with so many obstacles that most of us can't even imagine. A great story but the documentary also does a great work mixing animation with real images on a very clever way and in a better way than I've seen before in similar docs. Great score also.My only complaint is that I would love to have seen more 20 minutes of it and to go a bit further, for example, on his current relationship with his family. I really wanted to see how it happened when he met her mum again...",False
11,7,"To be honest, I have a conflicting feeling about Flee.",pasaribuharisfadli,n/a,15/08/2025,"I admire how the film interpreted the story as a visually pleasing animated docu-drama with a strong emotional core. It's hard not to carry away by Amin's heartbreaking story.However, despite Rasmussen's admirable direction, the film also feels somewhat contrived in conveying its message. Not because of the choice in the filmmaking, but it suffers from a western gaze.It seems the film is in dire need to fit this specific aesthetic which has the tendency to convert a non-European point of view into something... European. Psychologically competent, but rather vague in its anthropological/sociological authenticity.",False
12,9,"Amazing, powerful, stunning!!",paulclaassen,n/a,15/08/2025,"For some reason I've always wanted to see a gay-themed animated movie. My wish was fulfilled with 'Flee'.Although the primary theme here is not homosexuality, our hero, Amin, is gay. Haunted by memories of his past, Amin tells his story to a psychiatrist and we follow his life through back flashes. His story starts in 1984 when he was ""three or four years old"". He realized he was gay at a very young age, and fantasized about Jean-Claude van Damme. However, he was a gay man in Afghanistan in a time when homosexuality ""did not exist"" in that country. (Amin is also easily one of the sexiest animated characters ever!).'Flee' is a powerful and heart-breaking story about a family fleeing their country so their sons don't have to fight - and die - in war. Their journey takes them to Russia, where they have to overcome obstacle upon obstacle to survive. I was captivated - and moved - from beginning to end. The film reminded me so much of 'Waltz with Bashir' - one of my all-time favourite animated films.They cleverly combine actual footage with animation. Note, although this is an animated film, it is aimed at a mature audience. A young demographic will not understand the events in the film. This is a very serious movie and might not appeal to children.'Flee' was incredibly relevant now (in 2022) with the ongoing Ukranian/Russian war. Based on fact, the events depicted here are bound to pull at your heartstrings and even shock you to the core for the inhumane and selfish actions of various individuals, and ignorant bystanders.I enjoyed the film's narration, presentation, and unique animation. I loved every moment of 'Flee' - in different stages of emotion. Wow, this was stunning! 'Flee' is an instant favourite!Would I watch it again? Yes!! And again, and again, and again...",False
13,6,Perhaps a BIT overrated...?,matthewssilverhammer,n/a,15/08/2025,"Flee has become especially prescient in recent weeks. However, despite the incredible story, this just didn't hit me the way it seems to have hit others. I think the animation (though attractive) might have hurt its effectiveness for me. I'll accept that I may be wrong about that; I seem to be alone in that opinion.",False
14,4,Individual story not really interesting enough for large audience,Horst_In_Translation,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOkay, I definitely cannot list all the production countries from this title and I will also spare you the five languages that are a part of these slightly under 1.5 hours, but ""Flugt"" or ""Flee"" is a mostly animated documentary from 2021 and one of the bigger, if not biggest players from the recent awards season. The director is Jonas Poher Rasmussen and he scored two Oscar nominations for his effort here in the animated feature category and documentary category and he even kinda got a third one with the foreign language feature category. The film won none of those three, but I feel it came in second at least once (documentary) or maybe even more often than that. The only category where it really had no chance to win was the foreign language category or whatever it is called now. As for Jonas Poher Rasmussen, it is his first film in over six years annd surely the most successful release from his career. I am not sure that says something positive though about his body of work, but I will get to that later. If you look at the idea of this film, an animated documentary, the first similar approach that comes to mind is of course the Israeli movie Waltz with Bashir that also had some success with the Oscars, fewer nominations though, and also did not manage a win, but it was at least as hopeful, probably more. I think I preferred Vals Im Bashir. I could say that these two make for a good double feature, but I did not like this one enough to do so. You can surely say it is a Danish movie because of where it is set for the most part and because of who made it, even if the main character comes from another country. I think the current political climate and the mainstream definitely helped this film a lot. There is major focus on a refugee and also some focus on his homosexuality. These topics do come in handy and there is no denying that.From a filmmaking perspective, however, I had a pretty hard time to appreciate this film. I did not struggle with the animation style. That was not great, but okay all in all and not among the weaker aspects. What I struggled with was the fluency of the entire thing. Or lack thereof. With that I am mostly talking about the ways in which the characters were moving. It felt stiff and abrupt and just not smooth apparently and the argument that it was a stylistic choice does not seem valid to me. It clearly at times hurts the overall viewing experience. Another criticism is about what you actually see on the screen. There are some moments (not always admittedly) when there is a background that is basically one picture (no motion) and in front of it all one character is moving. Or two. It just does not feel convincing and worthy of a movie that received so much awards recognition to be honest. Technically, there are many weaknesses and again I cannot really accept the argument that the background was irrelevant and that it was just all about the character(s) in front. I will not elaborate on the voice actors here. I am not familiar with them and I am not a Danish native speaker, so I cannot say for sure how good they were. The voices kinda fit the characters I assume, so no heavy criticisms here. The subtitles were fine as well. I had the chance to see this film on the occasion of a (50%) audience competition linked to the European Parliament and to be honest if those European Parliament folks were the ones who picked this film into the group of three from which one will be the winner, then I am not surprised at all. Fools galore. But that is another story and I am also not surprised that one other nominee is even more terrible and the third film is also not particularly great, just better than the other two, but the level overall is really, really weak.Anyway, back to this one here: I already described briefly why I think that mainstream has more to do with this film's success than actual quality filmmaking and I will go on and elaborate a bit on that. I am all for it if you make a gay-themed movie and deliver some amazing story with it. I think Milk and Brokeback Mountain for example are masterpieces or close to being masterpieces. Because they do not rely on the homosexuality alone to carry the film, but the story that comes with it, that surrounds it. This film here does not. It shove the idea directly into our faces. Be it the moment when he says at the very start that he had always been a little bit different (and I say that as somebody who quite likes a-ha), be it the moment when we hear him talk about how he wants a pill to suppress his homosexuality or be it the moment when we see how his father so happily accepts his gay son and does not take him to a brothel, but to a gay bar - all these scenes have zero subtlety to them. No depth at all and felt so scripted and the sad thing is they even got a reaction from some audience members as if it was all something truly creative. Not the case. I also severely doubt that most of this actually happened the way it was told here, but the film is based on real events, actual people, so it should have. It simply does not feel authentic. Another scene I struggled a bit with was the one with the problems the main character has at the beginning when he asks if they can take a break and the filmmaker is so happy to be humble and says yes sure of course, he is so happy that the fella wants to share his story and it's all good etc. Right afterwards he opens up effortlessly? Yeah, right. And during this break the dialogue keeps being recorded and what he said is played to us. Either the filmmaker secretly ignored his star's wish (even if said star agreed to it later on) or it is really all staged. The moment of conflict between the two men (filmmaker and protagonist) on one occasion also felt quite for the sake of it when one asks the other if he is also no longer on his side or so.Then there is the protagonist's boyfriend: This alleged bond made the main character even less likable to me. I mean why would he talk to the filmmaker about his plans for the immediate future and then say his boyfriend does not even know about them. Come on. This is not flawed in a likable way. This is either messed-up or fake and fictitious. The solution in the end then with the two men standing there close to each other and we see that they have a happy future also could not win me over romantically. Oh and I must also talk about the Russians/Soviets here and the way they are depicted. First, it must be said that the protagonist fled from Afghanistan. You can probably make a point that he actually had to flee that he was a refugee in the sense of the word, which many are not, and even with him it is definitely not a 100% clear case. Not everybody who leaves a country was made to because their lives were at stake. But that is another story. As for the Soviets, I mean living in Russia was not the paradise for him either, but he did not have to fear getting killed because of his sexuality. That is a crucial point. Why are the Afghans not depicted as the enemy here. Instead, how do we perceive the Russians this time? They are all corrupt, ready to ignore the law and all morals if they get some money from the poor refugees. They smell like booze in a disgusting manner even if there is a door between you and the Russian man. Their high-profile officials are ready to group-rape innocent women they arrested in the streets. In dark alley. And our rolemodel hero is sad he did not interfere. And we know he never could have this charming man. The Russians will also interfere if you demonstrate against something that they want to keep as the status quo. (We have seen that in Germany lately, haven't we? And many other countries.) So, basically the Russians in this film are depicted like animals or even worse. Bet many liked it with the current Ukraine situation. Like the lowest of the low. We must say that this was the country that let the protagonist and his folks in, allowed them to stay. For a while at least. And did not deport them without checking their backgrounds. They had no other country to go to. And still all this film does is insult and attack Russians. Shameful and ungrateful.Very fitting too if we look at the lie that the protagonist's family were all dead. Instead, they were all having a pretty decent life in Sweden and he got to see them again towards the end of the film. The scene with the confession that he is gay I mean. This also came out of nowhere for me. Like why exactly he would have to tell them that very moment felt a bit scripted to me. No real elaboration before that that he had to get it all out or something. There is not a lot I liked from this film as you can see from my rating here. Maybe one aspect I liked was the story with the other fella who was sent to Switzerland. They left it open if he was gay too and the idea and consequence that they had to be torn apart although they got along well was depicted tastefully and without unnecessary melodrama. Just the way it was / would have been I guess. Nonetheless, the real question for me was if this is just a poor film or a really bad film. Had I gone with the latter, I would have rated it 2 out of 10 only, but as you see I did not, so I was a bit generous here. It is really as far away from a positive recommendation as it gets and I am sure that even if I watch this another five times, then I will still not give it a thumbs-up. I do not have the slightest intention though to watch it only one more time. One of the biggest film disappointments of the year. It has all the mainstream topics that liberal Hollywood loves so much, but it just does not have 10% of the substance it should have to justify all the awards recommendation it received. For me clearly a thumbs-down and I am glad it did not win any of its Oscar nominations. The poster for this film here on imdb looks strange too. All quantity over quality again and barely a (not far-fetched) connection to the story. Better watch something else.",True
15,n/a,Intimate. Affecting. Personal. Profound.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Chronicling the harrowing journey of an Afghan immigrant and the unfathomable adversity he & his family had to navigate through to find a new home, Flee lends a powerful, heart-rending & thought-provoking perspective to the refugee experience through the first-hand account of its protagonist, and makes for a strongly moving documentary that's rendered on screen with care & consideration.Written & directed by Jonas Poher Rasmussen, the film employs animation to narrate the life story of its protagonist who's been harbouring a secret he finally feels ready to reveal for the first time. The use of animation not only allows the director to sketch a stimulating portrait of the narrator's dark & traumatic past but also helps protect his real-world identity by keeping him & his family anonymous.Though a work of rich, evocative animation for the most part, the film does make use of live-action archival footages sometimes to help ground our storyteller's testimony in reality. Add to that, the emotional wallop it provides only contributes to the film's overall bracing impact. But it's not all disturbing & distressing, for there lies his own coming-of-age story & his road to self-discovery which is beautifully illustrated.Overall, Flee is an achingly human & emotionally stirring slice of life that's crafted with heart, told with compassion and has an apt understanding of its thematic content. Thoughtful in its approach and empathetic in its presentation, this Danish memoir is a gripping blend of artful animation & documentary realism, and definitely ranks amongst the most intimate, affecting, personal & profound films of 2021. Thoroughly recommended.",False
16,10,"Great Animation, Great Documentary",jjaanjoseph,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love the combination between Animated Movie and Documentary, Flee should've won best documentary and best international film (Denmark) but lost to both awards to Summer of Soul for best documentary and Drive my Car (Japan) for Best International film.

17,10,Everyone needs a friend,severindringel,n/a,15/08/2025,"Flee is an animated documentary from Denmark that could win the popular Golden Statue in three categories at the Oscars (Best Documentary, Best Animated Feature, Best International Film). Jonas Poher Rasmussen tells the gripping story of his friend Amin, who confides in him for the first time in a personal conversation the truth about his flight from Afghanistan, which he has kept secret all these years.The protagonist of the film is a true hero. At a young age, he had to leave the country of his birth, Afghanistan, with his family, although he had enjoyed his life there to the fullest until the war began. The disappearance of his father is the first big question mark in the film that does not leave us until the end. The relationships with his family members alone, be it his two sisters, his already elderly mother or especially his big brother, with whom he shares a very special bond, are fascinating. The cohesion that this family exudes in such a crisis situation and the love they have for each other goes very close and it is unimaginable how they must have felt during those times. All the things Amin experiences and witnesses on his journey through dictatorial and corrupt countries are staggering and it is hard to imagine what he had to go through to be where he ends up. Years later, in fact, he is an integrated citizen of Denmark, successful in his profession and living in a happy relationship with his partner. The fact that he has to hide his homosexuality, which we as viewers know about from the beginning, in his homophobic homeland is also an essential theme of this documentary. For although he is always aware of his attraction to men, he perceives it as a disease because of his environment. Even this hurdle in his life Amin was able to overcome in the end. The friendship story between him and Rasmussen, which results in him telling the director his big secret, is also very moving.In terms of its chronology, Flee is told very simply, but at the same time it is an insanely complex character study. Amin is, as I said, a real fascination, how he managed to save himself as a homosexual refugee from Afghanistan, via Russia to Denmark and build a life there deserves respect and makes one proud of the character despite the anonymity. The second winner of this film is Rasmussen, who through his dedication to his friendship with Amin is able to tell this slightly confused feel-good story and give us something like hope. That the animation style also totally works and makes the narrative no less authentic is another great achievement.",False
18,10,100% essential must-see for all viewers,I_Ailurophile,n/a,15/08/2025,"With the grand total of two movies I saw in theaters in 2021, 'Flee' was featured in trailers before both, and though curious I was not so interested as to seek it out. Thankfully, sometimes the arbiters of Awards Season do something right, and the triad of nominations this has earned for the forthcoming 94th Academy Awards brought it to the forefront of my attention - and deservedly so: it's tragic, and heartbreaking, but also extraordinary in ways I couldn't possibly have imagined. This is not an easy movie to watch, but it is unquestionably essential - and hands down one of the best films of 2021, and of recent memory.The construction of the feature is a stroke of brilliance. Strictly speaking 'Flee' is a documentary, but subject Amin's recollections, and indeed the ""modern day"" scenes grown-up Amin shares with the filmmaker, are animated so as to cloak the identities of those involved, but also to present a dynamic rendition of the story he relates. The 2-D work of the illustrators is simple, but very effective in communicating the course of events and the emotions of the figures. Moreover, the static backgrounds are often downright beautiful as they offer up various landscapes as settings for each scene. Factor in archived footage, including news reports, to cement the context for everything of which Amin speaks, and the result is utterly transfixing. No matter how devastating the film may be throughout much of its length, it's all but impossible to tear our eyes away.Incredible as Amin's tale is, there's no mistaking that it's one that has played out time and again in history, and continues to. There is so much terrible history, cruel politics and policy-making, and abject prejudices wrapped up in the narrative 'Flee' imparts: The regular invasion and occupation of Afghanistan throughout history by various powers, exploited as nothing more than a pawn even by those trusted with its governance, while no effort is made to better the lives of its people. Corruption. Homophobia. Human trafficking, and all the squalor and horror that comes with it - but also the faint hope it represents for refugees, far from home, who have no other recourse. The separation of families. Racism, xenophobia, and the total denial of human rights as a concern. The extreme, lasting trauma that even a fragment of these experiences may ingrain. Even for viewers who haven't encountered any such circumstances, the very nature of the subject matter is heart-rending, and the very synopsis is one massive content warning. Even knowing all obviously ends well for our storyteller - when at last, within about the last ten minutes, young Amin finally receives some validation, the cathartic release is staggering.On the face of it, glimpsing 'Flee' from a distance, there's not necessarily anything about it to capture one's imagination. But any doubts I may have had last year were eased by news of the Oscar nominations, and totally washed away within minutes of pressing ""play"" - not only does 'Flee' fully deserve each of those nominations (and I think the awards, too), but in this moment I'm rather surprised it wasn't also nominated for Best Picture. It is wholly riveting from the very start, and for all that is woven into the story of Amin's life, by default there is also crucial messaging at the core about human rights, as they must apply without exception to everyone in all situations. I'm truly blown away: mixed expectations were raised considerably, and still completely upended. In no way is this a feature of the sort that customarily draws the attention of a general audience (the triple whammy of a documentary, animation, and LGBTQ topics) - yet in addition to its sheer excellence, those qualities are exactly what makes this a critical must-see for each and every possible viewer. There's little more I can say without revealing details of the content: 'Flee' is an astounding, terrific picture, one of the very best of the last year in the very least, and it earns my most sincere and enthusiastic recommendation.

It tackles the psychological and sociological implications of human trafficking, war victims, immigration and other important topics. The animation is dark and masterfully done.

24,7,good,djurrepower,n/a,15/08/2025,"While the animation was fine, and felt more like a nessesity rather than a choice. But in the end the whole journey is pretty interesting, and well paced. All in all, pretty great story, but thats also kinda all there is.7/10: very good, but not much else than just a good story.",False
25,2,Weak and biased,thios_ban,n/a,15/08/2025,"An ""animated docudrama"" that ultimately fails. There is no connection with the protagonist who seems to exploit his tragedy in order to gain what he wants (both storywise and filmwise). Completely biased, the protagonist seems to be more bothered by the Russians than the Americans who destroyed his country together with the terrorists (it's ""Vice Studios"" after all). The animation style becomes tiring with its' stop-motion like effect, even if some parts are well made (especially the more abstract parts). Bad film, but it has all the ingredients to succeed, overall a well studied project to gain awards (but not our attention or empathy).",False

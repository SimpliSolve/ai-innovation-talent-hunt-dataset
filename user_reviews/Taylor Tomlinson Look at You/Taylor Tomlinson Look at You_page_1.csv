1,8,She's a hoot!,thejdrage,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a lot older than Taylor and I think she is a riot! She has women's issues down pat - no matter the age or race. She's just funny - and she has a great way of looking at life and the life of women.Thank you, Taylor!",False
2,7,Not everyone's sense of humor but she's good,AfricanBro,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't want to compare them because they're two completely different comics, even though they both mention considering themselves as having dark humor I wouldn't say Taylor Tomlinson does it(she just makes fun of what she's been through), but it reminds me of Daniel sloth in the way they both approach their shows. They talk about serious issues that a worthy to be addressed and make it more than just jokes because a lot of meaningful things were said in this special. And I don't agree with people saying it's female comedy because anyone can be funny and even though yes, she does divert to female oriented content for a huge chunk of the show I still thought she was funny. I think I liked this show better than her first, when I watched her Quarter-life crisis special, I didn't particularly find it funny in it's entirety but she's very engaging and talented and her material was relatable. So I thought this special is funnier in my opinion while still keeping those qualities(other people have said quarter life crisis was better though so matter of opinion I guess). Her writing is also great, because her jokes don't depend much on her delivery or riding the wave of an earlier joke, they're all individually funny. I think what's the best part about it is is the jokes are consistent and they land which keeps you interested throughout and I hope she gains more recognition as her career progresses.",False
3,7,It was okay,solojere,n/a,16/08/2025,"Taylor Tomlinson, for the most part, is a funny comedian. There is nothing special about this special, but it did make me chuckle a few times. And it is not a bad way to spend an hour.",False
4,9,A fantastic hour of standup,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"Taylor Tomlinson's first special was one of my favourites of the last few years, and this second one is even better. Watching standup is usually such a passive viewing experience because it's hard to get into it when you've seen so many specials, but something about Tomlinson's standup is really engaging.This is a very consistent hour of standup that touches on serious and dark subject matter without ever sacrificing the comedy. There's plenty of standup with serious sections that I like, but Tomlinson handles the heavy stuff in a way where no matter how dark it gets, it still remains funny, also while treating the subject matter tastefully and with respect.Kind of a masterful balancing act, and even people who might not find her style of humour funny can surely respect that. And if you liked her first special, this is a must-watch.Two for two as far as I'm concerned, so she honestly might well be one of the best comedians working today.",False
5,10,"Maybe it's acquired taste, but this was the funniest thing I've seen in so long.",Soimaskingforafriend,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely loved this special - way better than I anticipated. It's just a real conversation, with a comedic spin. It's finding a way to find an upside in the midst of hardships and learning to laugh at yourself.It's a conversation about things that some people might consider ""deep"" or ""heavy,"" but these are topics that so many people deal with daily.Love it. Hope to see more!",False
6,n/a,stand up comedy,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I grew up with comedians such as Jack Benny, Rich Little and others and they were pretty funny. Today's comedy is different though. I liked this show and I think Taylor is funny. This though is more for the 20 something crowd. This is still worth watching- it's only an hour and she's not that bad either.",False
7,6,She was funny...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was not familiar with stand-up comedian Taylor Tomlinson prior to sitting down here in 2023 to watch the ""Taylor Tomlinson: Look at You"" comedy special. I happened to stumble upon the show by random luck on Netflix, and thus opted to give it a chance.The contents of the show, which ran for 61 minutes, was actually good, and I have to say that I was genuinely entertained by Taylor Tomlinson's show. It was a good combination of various topics that she went through during her show, and it was good to see that it wasn't just jokes below the belt.Taylor Tomlinson certainly was good on the stage. She delivered her material quite well. She was good at setting up her jokes and then swooping in with the punchline. And that spurred some good laughs throughout the show.I was pleasantly surprised with ""Taylor Tomlinson: Look at You"" and found her to be a funny stand-up comedian.My rating of ""Taylor Tomlinson: Look at You"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",False
8,9,"Go Taylor, Go!!",brunokrystin,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm so happy for Taylor! She so deserves a Netflix special. It's been real great watching her grow and understand herself. Her comedy has evolved admirably and as an individual has grown wonderfully from her guest appearance on Your Moms House to Good For You.,False
9,6,Pretty funny,phojar,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really enjoyed her first special, and this was definitely worth watching. I don't think it was quite s as good as her her first.She did take some low political shots, which I don't appreciate, but let's face it, she is mentally ill so what do you expect.All in all I say watch it.",True
10,9,"Brilliant writing, timing, and delivery.",mitchandcary,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the most enjoyable, smart, deep, and thought-provoking stand-up specials I've seen in years. Those last three adjectives probably don't seem fitting for comedy, but that's what makes this special so unique. ""Brava"" for tackling sensitive issues in such an honest, selfless, and truly funny way. I enjoyed the heck out of this.",False
11,10,Gigglesnort funny,richinhd-30581,n/a,16/08/2025,Honestly I've never heard of Taylor Tomlinson before (oddly enough) but simply put I think I'm very picky when it comes to comedy and this was absolutely amazing. I laughed out loud several times and was really impressed by her thoughtfulness and how she tied all her subjects together.... I very highly recommend.,False
12,4,Inferior to the first one,Bill-412,n/a,16/08/2025,"First because she is now a celebrity and talks too much about that. Way too much meta material, almost none in the first one. She is too into herself.Second because, like all stand ups, the material is much thinner. For the first one there was a development period of at least five years, but for this one only about one year, so much less substance and less testing time for it.",False
13,9,It's an 8 but I want to offset some unbased reviews.,fotisx96,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's this stereotype that females are not good at stand-up.Also lately other female comics become intensionally vulgar for no reason. Maybe to be taken as edgy and progressive , i guess. I dont know whats with that! ( yeah Im looking at you Wong)But, I know Taylor is a hell of a good Comedian and she proved it for a second time on Netflix. She doesn't get vulgar if it's not beneficial for the story. She touches on some important issues in a funny and original way by connecting the whole material together and it works.It does get a bit dark at times but she's a master at relieving the pressure and bring you right back up.As a male watching this special of course Im not gonna get 100% of it and sure I'm not gonna be happy to hear an opposite POV that doesn't put my sex in the best light. That doesn't mean the stand up is bad. It means you get offended too easily.",False
14,9,Great stand up and growth for her,madisonchristinewoodward,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw her original stand up on Netflix about a year or two ago and liked it, but it wasn't amazing. I thought this one showed so much growth for her as a comedian and in her confidence. She has great timing and the jokes toe the line between upbeat and serious commentary, without bringing the mood down. I'm excited to see what else she does going forward!",False
15,10,Awesome For Someone Talking About Mental Ilness,lebullfrog,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerShe definitely has bipolar. I never seen anyone make fun of it the way she does. Most bipolar people love to laugh after they become stable. She definitely can laugh after her mania episodes.I hope she writes more about this subject. She shows people that bipolar is not run for the hills disease. Were not mass murders as the media & show producers like to emphasis.Hopefully in a comic way she spreads the truth about this chronic Illness. If my english not proper, it's that besides being bipolar, I'm also illiterate. Lots of red & blue line corrections when I type. Hate autocorrect.",True
16,10,Hilarious Dark Comedy,dana-rivera48,n/a,16/08/2025,"This stand up special had me cry laughing within the first 7 minutes. I am such a fan of her content and comedy. The content can get dark, but it doesn't make the special any less humorous.",False
17,10,Fantastic!,angelanwalker,n/a,16/08/2025,The negative reviews for this are bizarre to me. I know we all have different tastes but wow you must have a horrible sense of humor if you didn't like this! This was just as funnier as her previous Netflix special. How come Taylor Tomlinson isn't a household name already?,False
18,10,She is really funny.,the_hawk8,n/a,16/08/2025,She had me cracking up the whole time. Her comedy just hits just right. I like she is just so dark and covers taboo topics. I love to see women just go after it.,False
19,9,Taylor is Hot Harsh,Alturego,n/a,16/08/2025,"She was born to do standup.""Can you not tell this Chipotle that I'm bleeding and can't subtract!?""
Great show. Comedy is at its best when it is honest with the audience.Taylor is a gift. Please don't trip on a carpet.",False
20,8,"80% amazing, the rest standard girly standup",namob-43673,n/a,16/08/2025,"I give this a 8 simply because large parts of this show is amazing. All the psychology stuff, all the damaged I am taking drugs stuff is fantastic. It is not twisting your stomach dying from laughter funny, but it is so greatly done and so insightful and lovely that you can show this in therapy sessions.The less funny and not so great is all the standards from female comedians. Sex jokes, phallus jokes, boyfriends and relationships. Which I think is such a shame. Taylor is one of the most insightful, most intelligent and funny comedians in existence today and 80% of this proves that. So when she start talking about porn for women, masturbation and similar I lose a bit of interest. She is still funny, don't get me wrong, she is still better than 9/10 female comedians even when she goes mainstream standard, but when she is talking about therapy, dead relatives and dealing with life she is simply the best and I wish there was more of that.This is not the best comedy ever. I even think her last special was funnier, although that contained more of the standard stuff. But this is still, at least to 80%, amazing stuff that should be seen and listen to.I am absolutely convinced that 10-15 years from now Taylor will be hailed as the one of the greatest comedians of all time. She still have some minor bumps and hurdles to get over before she is there, but she will definitely get there.Fun, entertaining and in some parts fantastic. 8/10.",False
21,10,One of my fave comedy sets ever,BABSBunny24,n/a,16/08/2025,"This special turned out to be one of my favorite comedy sets that I have ever seen. I had gotten into a minor car accident earlier in the day and just really needed something to cheer me up. My partner and I were having trouble finding something that fit the bill, came upon this, watched the trailer, and I was laughing 15 seconds in. Clearly, it was the winner.Taylor has such a gift when it comes to discussing serious topics in a light way. She's able to share her opinions without coming across as preachy. Her timing, man, her timing is impeccable. She hits all the other comedy must-haves without it feeling formulaic. We were both truly impressed with her writing abilities. The time just flew by.So thanks to Taylor, for all her dedication to the craft, and for making me laugh after an awful day. Looking forward to the next one!",False
22,8,A tiny lull in the middle,ajelliott-38669,n/a,16/08/2025,"Other than that, hilarious as usual from Tomlinson.I thought that was enough, but here are some more characters to get this review submitted.Ok this is a review for a stand-up special. Not a lot i can say without spoilers. You either like it or you don't; and I did.",False
23,2,"Gave it 30 minutes, about 28 minutes too long...",pableto,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is obviously comedy for a generation of wokeness. Pretty bizarre to see. Nearly all first 30 minutes was spent on mental health issues and just came across as self absorbed and not particularly funny. Amazing to see her ask who had a therapist and 75% of the audience cheering like it's a great achievement,likewise when she asks about who's on antidepressants. Perhaps that's the target audience and why they find it funny. Personally, I think there's a ton of comics that are funnier and worth spending time watching...",False
24,10,Her best yet!,marayabidjerano,n/a,16/08/2025,"Taylor keeps getting better and better. Her special is real, raw, and insanely clever. It's not for everybody - and definitely not for people who still stigmatize mental illness/going to therapy. She speaks a lot about mental health without trauma dumping or being ""too woke."" In my opinion, her performance is a perfect balance between ""woke"" and raunchy. Absolutely loved this!",False
25,9,Taylor Tomlinson is among the elite,SimonSaysSmallScreen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tomlinson's material is more than funny. She penetrates life the way Pete Holmes or Chris Rock or Dave Chapelle do. Her honesty and insight make me laugh from recognition. It's beyond just silly or provocative easy laughs. Her aim is true. She puts it all out there for us. She is among the elite few who dare to go there. She deserves to do whatever she wants with her career, but I really hope she never stops doing stand-up.",False

1,10,Don't listen to the low reviews.,danielthabet,n/a,16/08/2025,"People scoring this with 1's or low reviews are doing so because they're the Covid maniacs that are still wearing a mask today, while they drive alone and probably when they shower. It's been scientifically and medically proven (a simple google search will show you) that masks, social distancing and lockdowns not only were ineffective but had negative impacts. And the jab, well, another simple google search will show you that these big corps are getting sued through the nose. This documentary is fantastic and a must watch and only exemplifies truth and it does it in an engaging way. Well done Grace Community Church! One of the best documentaries I've ever seen.",False
2,1,Confusion,maryrcollins-73758,n/a,16/08/2025,"I never understood why they just didn't do everything they could to protect the body of Christ. Why was it so hard to just put a mask on and distancing? It seems that would be showing care for each other. We are to be salt and light. How much damage was done to the unsaved who watched this whole thing unwind. What I heard from folks was why can't we all work together on this. Millions of lives are being lost. That is extremely concerning. The blatant refusal to not work with local authorities only tells me that this was more about control than a godly approach, how can we work together to keep everyone safe.",False
3,10,"ESSENTIAL ""practical theology"" film, with examples from Church history",tropiqa,n/a,16/08/2025,"The one-star reviews seem to be by people who've read summaries of the film, but haven't seen it, because it's FAR more complex -- historically and theologically -- than they indicate.The film shows examples from Church history of Christian leaders, and church members (lady who threw a stool), who disagreed with human authorities.The film then compares how the Church and State have related to each other differently over time -- incl. Roman Catholic and early Protestant ideas -- of the Church being over the State, and the Church and State being co-equal.The bulk of the film then shows how recent leaders wrestled theologically with biblical commands to obey BOTH God and God-ordained human authorities. The solution is NOT always simple, and so requires case-by-case analysis and discernment, outside of an actual word from God to do something.About MacArthur, decisions at his church are made by a 30+ member board of directors. The film shows their process of coming to agreement. The comment by another reviewer about his ""ego"", which cites an anti-Christian attack piece as an authority, is irrelevant.If you want to think and live biblically, esp. Under tyranny, the film will deepen your understanding of how to do that.For everyone else, the film will show the high degree of character, and intelligence, of some local church leaders as they respectfully disagree, and work toward consensus.RECOMMENDED FILM to see afterward, like dessert after a main course: Superspreader (2022). The Essential Church is how local church leaders responded. Superspreader is how an individual church member, with a parachurch ministry, responded.RELEVANT PASSAGES, not incl. Hebrew midwives (Exodus 1), Daniel praying, etc.:(a) ""submit... to... governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which is from God"" -- Paul; Romans 13:1""Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution"" -- Peter; 1 Peter 2:13(b) ""But Peter and John replied, 'Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God's sight to listen to you rather than God'"" -- Acts 4:19""Peter and the other apostles replied, 'We must obey God rather than men.'"" -- Acts 5:29(c) ""Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and unto God what is God's."" -- Jesus; Matthew 22:21""Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor."" -- Paul, Rom. 13:7(d) ""Christ is the head of the church... the church submits to Christ"" -- Paul; Ephesians 5:23-24a.",False
4,1,Religious freedom or MacArthur's ego,PeaceAndLongLife,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before you see this movie that paints one church as being under siege during the pandemic, think about the thousands of other churches that didn't feel threatened by the health mandates. Think about the churches that still managed to deal with the situation via virtual services and even community outreach programs. Think about the movie's bias in favor of John MacArthur and his church.Jim Hinch, senior editor of the Christian Guideposts magazine, wrote an excellent article ""How the Pandemic Radicalized Evangelicals"" (Los Angeles Review of Books, August 15, 2021). He points out that John MacArthur had a long history well before the pandemic of wanting to maintain absolute control over Grace Community Church and its seminary. A former seminary administrator said that MacArthur """"does not like anyone telling him what he can or cannot do."" A former deacon described the church as a toxic environment. MacArthur's responses to the pandemic were just another episode of his wanting to hold on to power.Hinch also described how other churches, including Rick Warren's Saddleback Church, dealt with the pandemic without defying the health restrictions.The movie is a propaganda piece that contains no information that would refute MacArthur's claims.",False
5,1,Misleading,yvonne-37,n/a,16/08/2025,"The main proposition of the documentary, that mandatory closures during the first months of the covid emergency were a satanic attempt to oppress the church is misguided, but probably intended to rally the faithful more than three years after the pandemic rather than to try to convince other people. It paints the pastors who remained open in defiance of local ordinances as heroes along the lines of those persecuted during the Reformation. During the early days of the restriction, those businesses deemed necessary for survival or to support remote work were allowed to remain open. Organizations of all kinds found ways to carry one remotely or to do things in other manners such as via videoconferencing or in-car church with FM transmission. Some denominations, such as the Episcopalians even adopted new methods of delivering communion and new prayers related to the inability to take it. There is little evidence to support the film's thesis.",False
6,10,Inspirational Godly Conviction Keeps Church Open In the Face of Extreme Government Overreach,markfkidder,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unwavering conviction at its finest. A movie that will serve as a touchstone for the ages as the church faces greater persecution. BRAVO!John MacArthur and the leaders of Grace Community Chuch in Los Angeles take a stand for God by keeping their church open in the face of threats of seven figure fines and imprisonment. This movie uncovers the motive of state, county, and city officials who were actively pursuing to control the churches for years to come. John MacArthur and the faithful elders come together by sending a message that the government has NO say in the affairs and ordinances of God.",False
7,10,A Movie for the Ages,TheMusicDr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Profoundly well-made and compelling, ""Essential Church"" deftly interweaves the stories of four churches: two in Canada and one in Los Angeles during the COVID-19 lockdown era; and that of 17th-century Puritans and Scottish Covenanters. An intense argument is briskly sustained throughout its two-hour runtime as to the relationship between governments and church, and who has the authority to govern it (not to mention conscience). What is an appropriate response when true believers are faced with tyranny? Of course, this also requires defining what a true church IS - the gathering of those who confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior to worship, learn, fellowship, and serve according to biblical truth.Beautifully photographed and crisply edited, and with an exceptionally effective wall-to-wall music score by Kevin Manthei, this story is told on an epic scale very deserving of the big screen. Whether you agree with the theology of the pastors or not, the foundational issues and arguments presented in this film are so timeless and universal as to warrant a hearing by anyone (unlike the haters who apparently posted 1-star reviews without seeing it). This is a thought-provoking experience, to the point that for me, after repeated viewings, there is still much to contemplate. Of course, you likely know the conclusion before you start: ""Christ, not Caesar, is head of the church!"" Interesting to note, the same conclusion was reached by the British epic ""Cromwell"" from 1970, with Richard Harris and Alec Guiness.",False
8,10,"Insightful Documentary, Truly Emotional",dimetrifleming,n/a,16/08/2025,"The cinematography of the documentary was quite astonishing, but this is not the most compelling part of the film. There was wonderful research that was clearly elucidated throughout the entire film.This film was emotional, taking the viewer through many turns of the essential church story and other historical stories. Anyone who has not seen this movie must watch this movie for many reasons, especially those that are against the decisions that Grace Community Church and other similar churches made during the Covid-19 pandemic. This movie made biblical arguments that were wonderfully sound and encouraging to all Christians.",False
9,10,Follow Me,dylangalvinacting,n/a,16/08/2025,"It becomes increasingly evident the dividing line that Jesus spoke about regarding true believers and false believers when you watch this movie. Many people will gladly say they are a Christian when it's beneficial and easy.Jesus said if you do not love him more than mother and father, even your own life, you're not worthy of him. Those who are truly following him will do so at all costs.You go into this really thinking you're going to get an anti-VAX conspiracy documentary and get something completely different. It's rarely if ever political and instead focuses on the history of the church and its relationship to government in different time periods.One of the most eye-opening things of the documentary is seeing how different governments have tried the exact same thing again, and again to shut down the church. And there is a time and a place for physical safety. If a hurricane is coming, you close the church and sent everyone home. It but after months of waiting for the hurricane and there's a few gusts of wind, and nothing more you don't keep people locked in their homes anymore.We absolutely witnessed an abuse of government power, and attention hungry media and the unjust and unconstitutional treatment of institutions of face during the pandemic. There is no argument. There is no wiggling out, there was no trying to say that's not what happened. It is so irrefutably clear. This is exactly what happened, and I love that this documentary shines a spotlight directly on what happened with data, biblical support, and very credible medical and virology personelle.The government does not have the right to mandate, alter or restrict worship. Ever. The church is essential and will continue to be until the end of the age.",False
10,10,"Convicting, Purifying and Preserving!",Cabin33mykingisJesus,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow! Just wow! Grace Productions drove it home, revealing truth that the whole world obliviously ignored. Jesus is going to use this documentary to change lives, however small or large the group of people impacted, it will be used. And already is. Delivering truth about the ""pandemic"", and revealing the necessity of having church. The Church will bow only to Christ, not the State, not a king, not any governing authority. It has helped my understanding on Church gathering, and the need for fellowship, no matter the circumstance, because the Church has always been essential. Christ, not caesar, is the Head of the Church! Believers must be ready to give everything up for the Lord, the Gospel, and the Church. Thank you! This documentary was well made, with an amazing intro, an amazing concept and it brought truth together so powerfully that you just know the Hand of God was involved in this. May people see and hear the truth.",False
11,10,Eye opening,rosesaphira,n/a,16/08/2025,"You have to watch this movie! Well made, impactful, and inspiring to stand for Christ against those who would say government trumps the church. Christ is the head of the Church!As a Christian, this movie will change your entire perspective of what happened during Covid and the agenda to shut down churches and keep people silent.The Word of God is so clear ""Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching."" Hebrew 10:24
There is a gigantic difference between seeing people through zoom or ""online church"" and going in person. Anyone who has been in church knows that.Give this movie a chance. You won't regret it.",False

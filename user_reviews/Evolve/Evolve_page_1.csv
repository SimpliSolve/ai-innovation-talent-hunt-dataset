1,8,"good concept, uplifting/educational/entertaining",happy_quadruped,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOn the whole I like this show - it's actually the first one I've watched on Curiosity Stream.Humanity's got a lot of problems but there are still reasons for inspiration and wonder, and this show focuses on them. The host is gregarious and likable. The production value is better than you might expect for a documentary like this. I've learned a number of cool things that I didn't know before and have left feeling inspired.My main critique is that it could use a bit tighter ""arc of explanations"" if you will. For example he shows us how seals can sort of see fish through their whiskers, and then connects it to these submersible robots somebody is researching, and somehow that is supposed to be relevant to detecting life on Europa. I mean, maybe, but I was struggling to follow the thread and it seems possibly even more speculative than the researchers intend. To the extent that the show is his own speculation rather than somebody else's it may fall short.That said, I did like it and plan to continue watching.",True

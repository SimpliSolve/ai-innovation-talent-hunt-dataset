1,7,Companion To Light Up The Sky,monstermovie-29712,n/a,16/08/2025,"More of a companion to the Netflix documentary, The Movie focuses more on performances than biographies. While the Netflix doc is excellent and provides lots of background info and a timeline of their career, it is very short on full performances of their songs. They make up for that here. There are full performances of 75% of their catalog. If you are a BLINK the chance to see them perform up close with a crisp picture and excellent sound should not be missed. If you aren't a fan then you can continue to scratch your head and wonder what all the fuss is about. Since we can't see them live right now this is the next best thing. Docked a star for not including DDU-DU DDU-DU from Cochella, a career highlight, and another one for not including Lisa's version of Say So from The Show.",False
2,8,BLACKPINK The Movie review,JeremyTM96,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before you watch: It's good to know before you go and see this movie is that it's basically 70% concert and 30% documentary.The movie wasn't bad at all, it can also make some blinks cry at times. It was overall a good experience watching!",False

5,10,Blackpink The Greatest Group Ever Made,aniketbasu-68916,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am like a blackpink og fan since from boombayah & I don't know any other group better than blackpink. I am being honest In my review the last part really made me emotional like their journey from the first till here, there ups & downs & their confidence that they can do anything If they have such will to made the movie the best.",False
6,4,90% copy of The Show,renatasgw,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don't get me wrong, I love Blackpink but this was very disappointing! 90% of this movie was a copy of The Show. No new content here just a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.",False
7,10,Love,maryamaraby,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerLike this. And thets very good and butiefull and l love the blackpink.,True
8,4,Serious let down...,ProstheticPrincess,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI went to see this in 4DX in the movie theatre.I was excited about it because I really love Blackpink!!!... but this was just a disappointment..
For the first 20min I was still wondering what this movie actually was.It was all over the place.It felt like a very long commercial leading up to nothing.Just snippets of performances that got cut off, then just random footage of the members posing in various rooms looking pretty,...
I'd watch that on youtube but a ticket to see this cost me over 20euros...
Eventually they did show some full song performances which was nice but the whole thing was very incoherent tbh.I love all the members but the things they were saying in this movie were just weird.It felt very rehearsed and just plain strange.Like ""I tend to look forward and try to prepare for things to come"" and then right after saying ""I live in the moment""... Like wtf are you saying?I saw the Netflix docu and that was real and great but this just sounded like scripted gibberish...Also my experience was 4DX because it was only available that way and while the whole thing was happening I felt very pissed off because 4DX was absolutely NOT necessary for this.Making a seat shake left and right during a dance sequence? What is that?! It had nothing to do with the content! It added nothing and was very distracting.It was just a way to get more money out of blinks because 4DX tickets cost twice as much.In my case I was also unfortunately seated next to two teenagers who were singing along (in what I assume they thought was Korean) the entire time, LOUDER than the actual BlackPink. The movie is not to blame for this but it did ruin my experience even more so maybe I'm not totally unbiased.Watch this at home once available and don't expect too much. That's all I can say.",True
9,9,Top quality content for true fans,vickybouriaud,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let's start there: yes, I am a huge fan of Blackpink. You are thus entitled to believe that my judgement is influenced. But I still want to try and proceed to write this review to explain why this is (almost) the best content I could've hoped for from the movie.First of all, let me address the most common critic I've read on this page, that is to say : ""90% of the movie consists of clips from The Show"". Yes? Helllllll yeah? I was soooo glad to get some concert clips ! Should I remind people that The Show was only broadcast on YouTube for 40$ with poor quality of video and sound? Of course, one could only expect that they would film the performance with high-end devices, edit it right and provide the public with ACTUAL concert footage that has top sound and image resolution. I shall add that many people have been tricked into believing The Movie would be a documentary? I precisely remind The Movie being listed as a ""concert/event"" type of movie when I booked my ticket. I mean I was not surprised at all with the content. I did not expect anything but a recording of The Show.I have never had the chance to go to an actual concert of Blackpink and I must say the experience of The Movie was beyond my expectations. The theater I went to really put in their efforts to render the highest quality of music and sound, it's like I was there in the crowd. The editing was ouuuut there man. The various audio tracks (the voices, the back music, the crowd) were perfectly mixed together so that you could really feel like you were there watching the concert.The only reason I am giving this movie 9/10 and not 10/10 is because I wish the interviews were a bit more consistent, perhaps they could have done so by adding more making-of footage from The Show. But overall, the scenery created for The Movie is exceptional, the recording of The Show is amazing (NOTHING like what you can watch on the internet in terms of quality and resolution) and I could feel that they made the movie for the fans, with a particular attention given (or should I say acknowledged) to the fact that 2020 and 2021 have seen close to 0 chances for fan to meet with Blackpink.If you are a fan and you have a good sound setup and a nice screen at home I would highly recommend you purchase the dvd when it's out. Otherwise, I hope there are still some showings around so you can enjoy this wonderful experience !",False
10,10,BLACKPINK is so AWESOME,colewaters,n/a,16/08/2025,BLACKPINK is the best girl group ever and this movie shows that. From the second it started my foot was taping and I was singing. It was truly a fantastic film. Please put it on a streaming service or DVD!!,False
11,5,Just Boring,blackskyonb,n/a,16/08/2025,"90% of this movie is THE SHOW clips mixed up with other performences. The remaining 10% is nothing surprising, just blackpink members sitting in front of a camera reflecting on their career for a few minutes. It was still cool to see all of it as a blink, but overally the movie is really disappointing and made with minimal effort as a grab for more money. The Netflix movie about blackpink is much more interesting.",False
12,10,Awesome perfect for a blink to watch,komalthakur-54391,n/a,16/08/2025,"I actually liked it
It tells us about the struggle our 4 Queens has done.",False
13,1,I went to watch a documentary and they gave me clippings of other things.,gleidsonlins,n/a,16/08/2025,"This ""movie"" is just a remix of several other things already available on YouTube. There's 10% new content that they (bp) didn't even bother to make an effort to appear. There were two solo performances by two of the four participants, and 80% of the performances were dubbed or with based terribly high. I particularly didn't expect some poorly placed scenes in a pseudo ""fan movie"".",False
14,10,BLACKPINK FANS REJOICE!,bondscammer,n/a,16/08/2025,"A love letter of sorts to fans who missed/unable to watch 'Blackpink: The Show' last January on their YouTube PPV channel, with added docu-style interviews and clips of Rosé, Lisa, Jennie and Jisoo looking amazing.All their hits represented here, in whole or in part, in high quality video and sound.I saw them at Coachella 2019, and this is the closest we'll get to them until the global pandemic nightmare ends!A tour de force of talent and beauty for this dedicated fan!Looking forward to their comeback summer 2025!",False
15,10,Good movie for kpopers only,renakusuma,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some hate critic proof they aren't kpopers,this movie is a documentary unlike biography.",False
16,1,95% Recycled content from The Show,ywghxpw,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel absolutely scammed! This was a waste of my time and money. I love Blackpink but you can feel the disappointing lack of effort they (producers) put into this. Besides the interview, the whole movie was taken from The Show. Was hoping to see more behind the scenes, perhaps the song writing process, concept meetings, old unreleased content, maybe even commentary from the people they collaborated with like late night hosts/lady Gaga/Selena, just something NEW!! I couldn't help thinking I wasted almost $100 (for my party of 5) the whole movie and I couldn't enjoy it at all. I'm honestly really starting to dislike how they try portray the girls in such a pristine and perfect light when the fans would truly appreciate seeing their vulnerable and humble side. If they didn't have any new content to show, then they could have delayed the making of this. I'm going to be mindful the next time I decide to spend any money on any ""exclusive"" content they release next.",False
17,10,Blankpink in your area,vinridente,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerBlankpink have taken over this movie shows why they are the queens of K-pop being a fan of this girl group I couldn't wait to see this movie and I wasn't disappointed and if your a fan you won't be disappointed this movie is an in-depth look at the phenomenon of Blankpink and really lets them shine in all there glory if you haven't seen it yet hurry up and watch .a must for all fans of Blankpink and if your not a fan this movie will make you become a fan.like I said for a fan like me this movie really is a highlight it shows the group in all there glory showing why they have become the queens of K-pop.,True

19,2,"Not like a movie, even if the title says so.",gonomon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before I went for this in local cinema, i watched netflix documentary of black pink and I was expecting similar kind of an experience but it was no where near that. This movie contains clips from older blackpink concerts, and nothing more really. It is totally made for people who are die hard fan of black pink (blinks) and if you enjoy music and documentary genre movies but if you are not a fan, better dont watch this one.",False

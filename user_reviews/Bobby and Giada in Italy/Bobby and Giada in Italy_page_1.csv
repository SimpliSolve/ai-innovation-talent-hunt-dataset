1,7,Just lovely and yummy!,johan-hillnas,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love Italy and italian food, and if you're in LOVE with Giada as much as Gelato, then Bobby Flay is a good guy to have around in a cooking show.You learn about food and Italy 'til you drool and end up smiling :)
NOTE: Have a good tv-dinner while watching or it's torture!",False
2,9,See Italy with famous friends,davebeson,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is how we would like to spend three weeks! Beautiful sights, fine food, and some laughs, too! Goads is the best.",False
3,8,Thoroughly enjoyable,jdavids-33964,n/a,16/08/2025,"Breezy travelogue about Rome and Tuscany where we join Bobby and Giada on their ride. A slew of hotspots worth visiting are helpfully marked on a map to reveal their location. Top-notch production value makes locations and food truly shine. If this show doesn't make you want to visit these places and taste this food, nothing will.",False
4,10,Worth the introductory price!,paul1645,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a big Food Network fan, and this is the show that convinced me to try the discovery+ channel (as a Verizon customer, I got it free for six months anyway). I'm half Italian, so the regions visited and recipes tried had special meaning for me. Bobby Flay and Giada De Laurentis have a great time in various regions of Italy, sampling local cuisines from unique little cafes, diners, and in a few cases luxury restaurants. And it's not just the classics like meatballs, pasta, and pizza, although those certainly figure in heavily to the trip! They have a world of fun trying their hand at making the recipes, and the ""family"" vibe of the people Giada interact with, especially where she sprinkles in a few Italian words of greeting, make this a very enjoyable watch! Highly recommend!",False
5,9,Engaging road trip,safenoe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBobby Flay and Giada De Laurentiis make an excellent cuisine tour guide pairing as they take us viewers through Rome and Tuscany in Italy of course, and Bobby gets a lots of recognition on the streets of Rome, but interestingly he lacks a fan base in Tuscany which is inexplicable I guess.Bobby is very passionate about Italian food and he lived in Italy for some time to eat and speak the language. The end credits are interesting because it's one of the few to state the host's restaurants where he's chef/owner. It states:Bobby Flat
Chef/OwnerShark
Gato
Mesa Grill
Bar Americain
Bobby Flay Steak
Bobby's Burger Palace.",True
6,2,Great focus on an old non-diverse Italy,malevents-85067,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great show great food. Great locales. But apparently neither Bobby nor Giada have any friends nor know any Italians of color. Every single person in the entire series is white. Except for brief glance the immigrants
Picking the brunello grapes they fawn over while ignoring the farmers.",False

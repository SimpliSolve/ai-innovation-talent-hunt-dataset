1,6,Jurgen Klopp: Germany's Greatest Export,Prismark10,n/a,16/08/2025,"As Channel 4 does not cover much by way of football. This was really a cash in documentary to capture the phenomenon that is Jurgen Klopp. They did something similar with Mo Salah a few years earlier as well.For a manager who describes his footballing style as heavy metal. This was light and frothy.It contrasts Klopp's time as a footballer and manager in Germany with Liverpool's fortunes since their last league title in 1990.Klopp started in the lower divisions and largely stayed there as a player. To make ends meet he even appeared in a quiz show back in 2000. It was only as a manager that he got in the big league with Dortmund.Of course Liverpool declined as the club could not meet the challenges from its rivals since the 90s. Especially Manchester United who had more money to spend and were better at attracting better players.Liverpool although tasted sporadic success, Klopp has bought what looks like a shot in the arm. In the last two seasons, Liverpool have won the European Champions League and finally the Premier League..There was very little that was new here. I would had liked to have known more about Klopp's footballing brain, tactical play and how he develops players. As I said it was lightweight and aimed at non football fans.",False

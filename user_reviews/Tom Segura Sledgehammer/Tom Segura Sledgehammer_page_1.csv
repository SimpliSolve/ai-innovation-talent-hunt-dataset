1,7,I wouldn't pay to see him there but on television it's okay.,deloudelouvain,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was my fourth stand-up comedy from Tom Segura, a comedian that I enjoy watching or better listen to. Sledgehammer wasn't my favourite though, that was Disgraceful from 2018, but it was still good enough for my wife and I to have a pleasant evening. There were enough good kinky jokes to bring some smiles on our faces. Those are just the best jokes. I think the venue where this was recorded didn't add to the quality of the show. It's a round podium so sometimes he talks to you with his back, certainly not something I would pay for, but on television he's of course always facing you. The show wasn't very fluent either but other than that it was okay, good enough if you're a fan of him.",False
2,8,Brilliant stand-up comedy,bananarchie-59503,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just discovered this brillant foul-mouthed stand up comedian.This show convinced me to add the test of his shows on my must watch list.He is al but afraid to avoid controversy.His topics are, amongst others, sexuality (straight, gay, whatever), educating children, drugs use and abuse.Sometimes he walks on a thin line of extreme funny and what for some people may occur offensive.But for me humour can go further on topics than any other medium. If it's funny or not is a question of taste and opinion. But censorship should never be applied on this kind of shows.As a European I sometimes don't understand the jokes because he yalks about famous Americans, unknown by me.But mostly his humour is international and he made me cry several times with his witty observations.I fully recommend to let him take you on a hilarious trip!!!",False
3,7,"Started off the rails, hopped the track a few times.",jaredlemin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not gonna like, there are some uncomfortable moments in this one so choose wisely who you watch it with. There were a few times I was ready to turn this one off, but I'm glad I powered through because Tom came through like he always does and the laughs came like I always knew they would. You know what you're getting when you turn on a Tom Segura special and he delivers again with this one. I just could have done without the jokes that make the namesake of the special, but I guess I'm not really the target audience for those. This rating feels right, but I'm about to watch the rest of his specials I can get my hands on and I expect those ratings to be higher.",False
4,n/a,"Lots of fan service, not a lot of jokes",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm a huge Segura fan, I've seen him live many times and this special is definitely his worst. It's not terrible, but it isn't much of a ""special"" that I'd recommend to anyone that isn't already aware of Tom Segura's material and family relationships.The big issue with this is that it's SO MUCH FAN SERVICE. Basketball injury and recovery, Christina's injury and his interaction with the police, talking about his relationship with his kids/mom and dad, taking edibles with Joey Diaz, Garth Brooks references, ect. It's essentially all of the jokes/stories that Tom Segura and YMH fans already know, but with a Netflix logo on it.The sad part is that the last time I saw him live (post-Ball Hog recording, pre-Covid), he had new material that was pretty good, but I guess he decided to completely scrap it once the basketball injury happened. Not a single joke from the winter 2019-2020 pre-Covid era made it into this special, but super played out ""where are the bodies, G"" fan service winks made the cut.",True
5,9,Different.,Brad_G35,n/a,16/08/2025,"I still wish this special was called I'm Coming on Netflix. I attended the I'm Coming Everywhere tour and it was great.I think this is a good special aka collection of stories. If you're a fan of Tom(which I am), you'll love this.With that being said, this special seemed off while watching it. I'm not sure if it's because he did it in the round or what. I can still find the funny if I've already heard most of the jokes. I rewatch specials all the time.I will rewatch this one but seeing this set live was leaps better than it comes across in this special. Again, I'm not sure if it's because it's in the round or some of the quick camera switches or what, but it just didn't work for me.I saw him twice around May/June of 2022 so the material was still fresh and he didn't seem tired of it. I do know this special was filmed in November of 2022(because I tried to get tickets).. maybe having done the material so much and everywhere. Maybe that made it stale when the actual filming happened.If you're a fan of Tom, watch this! You'll love it! If you're not a fan of Tom and feel confused, keep watching it... then start watching Your Mom's House(YMH) for a few weeks. Come back in a few years and watch this. You'll get it.",False
6,10,Funny af,scottishjennie,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched it 3 times already. I laughed so hard at his Mum getting high. I've felt felt just like her. I loved that actual video you posted with her on the porch. When she said ""don't leave me"" and you said ""I'm not leaving you"" made my heart happy. But you should have said to her let's talk about Hawaii. I laughed so hard at his little son flushing his keys. He does an awesome Uncle Joey impression. He sounds just like him. I wasn't a fan of the round room but that's only because I love his subtle facial expressions and I wouldn't want to miss them if I was there. Can't wait for the next one. I will probably watch it again. ðŸ˜‚
Thank you, I love you.",False
7,10,Blown away,vernonrobinson-34391,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never been a fan of Tom, his clips from his podcast pop up on my socials and I've never found him to be that funny. But I've been on a comedy special kick lately and decided to give him a chance.... ive got to say, this is one of the funniest comedy specials I've EVER seen. I was ROLLING from the start to the very finish. His raunchy hold no punches comedy routine may be a but offensive for more ""casual"" listeners, but if you like a bit of dark humor, this special is for you. His jokes cover topics such as things like Christianity, death, children, drug use, relationships, sex and even domestic violence, but he is able to bring humor to them. A bit edgy humor but still light hearted.",False
8,1,What the hell was this?,jl1982,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerExtremely disappointed. I really enjoyed all his previous specials and the times I've seen him live in the past.If you think about it, there weren't many ""jokes"" in this special at all. He tells a few stories, none of which having much of a payoff. The story about his mom getting high, about his injury, about his kids.. all of them go nowhere and are pretty standard stories for stand-up with no surprises, no punchline.. nothing. He tries to make callbacks to previous bits throughout to show that he has some sort of grand flow, but instead it's just forced and unfunny. The ""controversial"" topic bits had no joke to them either (spoiler: his kid saw his dick, he makes a taboo statement, and that's it. No joke or purpose to the story). The audience laughter sounds to be mixed louder than it was in reality as well. His delivery is obviously established enough to keep the crowd engaged, but the actual content is boring as hell.This was one of the worst standup specials I've seen in quite awhile. Maybe Tom is just content with life, creatively empty from doing so many podcasts, and doesn't have anything new or exciting to share. Sucks to have him on the front of Netflix with such a subpar release though.",True
9,4,"Lazy, once again. Live podcast at best",milosek,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another lazy special from a man who delivered some great memorable bits in the past.Yet now, for a second special in a row, he is just doing podcasting with pauses for easy name-dropping caused ovations.Tom is just coasting on his fame and doing nothing of the actual stand-up work like coming up with premises, developing bits, making original punchlines. He is just telling a stories like any random person would. Followed sometimes by his signature and still funny noise making.This would be trashed broadly if not for his developed and loyal audience that don't seem to acknowledge he isn't doing stand up anymore.",False
10,4,mostly an inside-joke for super-fans,rorisshe,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you were to watch this special never having heard of Tom Segura you'd conclude Tom Segura is not a very funny man. You'd prob turn it off after the first 10 minutes. It's borderline hacky, unnecessary edgy, and leaves you with an impression that Tom is not a very good person(and doesn't know it).But the special does get better after 18 minutes, there are some funny good-old-Tom stories, he's great at using call-backs.I think the target audience for this was Tom Segura's super-fans, and if you're one, you'll prob enjoy it: ""Sledgehammer"" feel like an inside joke - there are multiple references to the universe of Tom's life that only followers would know which I think creates this intimacy/cult following.Overall, I would not recommend ""Sledgehammer"" I think watching his ""best of"" on youtube or listening to podcast is better - which is not WEIRD.By now Tom has honed in his voice and point of view - so he finds the funny effortlessly. Why those funnies are not in this special I do not know.",False
11,4,Doesn't land on home viewing,hazzaboombatty,n/a,16/08/2025,"Glad the crowd enjoyed it!I like Tom a lot, I really like Mostly Stories and Disgraceful, and I liked ball hog too. But I think I laughed maybe 3 times in this special. Maybe he got too healthy and too successful to laugh at himself or find real humour in situations like he used to, but this is felt a little bit flat..Why is comedy so bad now? Are they so scared to get cancelled they won't say anything remotely funny any more? Seems like Dave Chappelle and a few others like Sam Morrill are the only funny people left willing to take a risk. I don't need it to be ""edgy"", god forbid, right?! But comedy used to be a LITTLE bit edgy.Pryor, hicks, carlin Chappelle.... Little bit of bite. And I'm not taking about being transphobic or offensive I'm taking about saying funny things that actually make you think, or maybe things that are actually true that you haven't articulated yourself.This just isn't funny enough.",False
12,2,When does comedy start?,languagewiz,n/a,16/08/2025,"The bigger these comedians get, the less funny they become. Segura, theo, bert and even rogan. Not funny at all. Just some weird witty chit chat that bored people are forced to laugh at. Not only are these guys have become unfunny in their ""every day life"" storytelling but even when they obviously make up stuff that didnt happen, still not funny. Why are these comedians so popular? I dont get it. Segura WAS funny before he became super popular. Rogan WAS funny before he became a super star. These guys always talk about ""refining their art and making it better"" but there is nothing ""better"" about their comedy.",False
13,3,I was at the live recording of this one and...,kaylamyprincess,n/a,16/08/2025,"And I was nervous for this special to air because my husband and I...feel asleep at the show. I feel like about half way thru I started nodding off and my husband around the same and we only had one drink. I was embarrassed and nervous you would see us sleeping esp because Im a Tom fan; seen all his specials and love his podcast with Cristina...but looking at the other reviews, guess it wasn't so far fetched after all that we thought it wasn't as great as his others and couldnt stay awake. And it was worse live in my opinion sadly :/ I think if he would've engaged more with the audience it would've helped.",False
14,1,Tom used to be funny.,usama713,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know what was that! I laughed once or twice at most. I don't follow his podcast, but I've watched his other specials, his earlier works were fantastic. But now he seems to have lost all his mojo. I wonder if this is because he is so consumed by podcast and so. This special was very disappointing to say the least. I watched till the end, but over 3 days! I only persisted till the end only in the hope that there will be something. But the jokes never landed well. Tom needs to get out of his bubble where all his super fans are simply blinding him to the fact that his materials need some work.",False
15,1,Hard to call this comedy or special.,seanorafferty,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been a fan of Segura for about a decade, and this is probably the most let down I have ever been by a special.Its tough to really even call this comedy. At no point did I laugh audibly and only at a few points did I even grin.It is mostly benign stories about things his little kids did or said, the kind of comedy I would expect from a late 90s Jeff Foxworthy set, not a modern comedy special. The ""funniest"" part was a totally unoriginal bit about giving his mom a THC edible. Predictable, unoriginal, heard that bit from 100 different comedians, friends, podcasts, etc.The majority of the special, the cloud is generous, offering ""clap-ter"" even when bits bomb. Its hard to even identify what were the punchlines or what he thought would have made people laugh about what he is saying. He goes so slow it seems like maybe he thought he was going to get more applause than he got and at several times I legitimately cringed.I think this may be the result of a comedian losing touch with what is funny, what got them their audience, and just playing to crowds that are there to see them, love their youtube channel, and are just happy to be in a room with them.I recommend skipping this one, you aren't missing anything.",False
16,1,absolute cash grab,fetus_milkshake,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tom segura is not funny!I don't understand why anyone still thinks he is even worth watching,
furthermore who is paying this guy?I didn't even make it through the laugh track after his first joke and i already knew this was a waste of time and money.He was on kill tony the other day wearing his adorable matching jacket with joe rogan and you could see just by they're reaction to a special needs comic (jared nathan) that neither of them should have the title of comedian anymorebut i said ""hey i'll give this special a shot"" he is supposed to be funny after all...turns out he's very out of touch and very unfunny.",False
17,1,Don't Waste Your Time,khgqndk,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is in the running for worst stand up of all time. All he talks about is life events that aren't funny. There's no punchline, no real joke happening. Tom is essentially emulating the other killers of comedy in his delivery and actions. This stand up should have been titled, ""the everyday lives of humans."" No big deal. Nothing he says in this special matters...nothing. If you were to write your boring daily life in a journal, publish the writing, and have people fawn over it like it was something never heard or accomplished before, great, this standup is for you. It's a boring take on his boring life.",False
18,3,"I hate leaving negative reviews but... 700,000 people got ripped off!",orcinussr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Obviously I can't review a stand up set without 'spoiling' it but, super lame - Let's just say, if I had a sledgehammer within arms reach, I would a) bash my device b) bash my router c) bash my own skull or d) all of the above and in that order - basically he's not funny and something about that massive brag at the beginning just rubbed me the wrong way - oh wow Tom you spent 26 months doing your job? You got paid to travel and tell jokes? Chiel please, now shuffle off to Buffalo and leave all these fine people alone - or maybe I'm just put off by the aforementioned humble brag ans can't get past it.",False
19,4,I wasn't particularly amused...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stumbling upon the 2023 stand-up comedy show ""Tom Segura: Sledgehammer"" whilst perusing the stand-up section on Netflix, I opted to check out the show as I wasn't really familiar with this comedian. I think I've seen one show earlier, but wasn't really all that impressed.The ""Tom Segura: Sledgehammer"" show was one that didn't really appeal much to my particular sense of humor. Sure, it was watchable, but Tom Segura didn't really get much laughs out of me with the contents of his show. I had a chuckle or two along the way, and that was about it. Not that I am saying that his material was bad or that the show was bad, not at all, it just wasn't within th scopes of my sense of humor.Tom Segura does seem to feel naturally at home on stage and in front of a crowd, and he does deliver his material quite nicely.And having sat through 61 minutes of this, I can honestly say that ""Tom Segura: Sledgehammer"" is not a stand-up show that will get a repeated viewing from me.With the show being filmed at a 360 open stage, it can't be helped but the audience getting to have jokes and material delivered whilst looking at the performers back, it just took away some of the in-your-face and face-to-face presentation that I feel a show should have. I certainly would be disappointed to go to a show like that and be looking at the comedians backside.My rating of ""Tom Segura: Sledgehammer"" lands on a four out of ten stars.",False
20,5,A Netflix special without any special jokes...,Airman87,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most people would probably say Tom Segura does not have any specific style of comedy if you asked them. That's because his style is shades of gray tones, bland, and comfortable fodder for an older couple in wanting some 'spicy' entertainment for their evening date out. That's how I would describe Segura's schtick.Segura's special Sledgehammer is Segura at his absolute worst: delivering some of the most banal and commonplace jokes possible. One specific set about his two boys versus his cousin's two girls wasn't even humor - you could honestly mistake it for some incoherent drunk at a bar just discussing his ordinary day. The humor in this Netflix special is so dry it feels like it is just a recording of a regular touring set he would do anywhere. If Segura wrote new jokes for this comedy special they sure weren't flushed out beforehand.People who don't regularly watch standup comedy will probably find Sledgehammer acceptable enough, maybe even find a few chuckles here or there, but definitely not sidesplitting humor. To the people like me that have been watching standup going on 30 years now, you won't find what you're looking for here.",False
21,n/a,Weak and boring,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This ""show"" is so bad i had to force myself to finish it. It took me three tries because i kept falling asleep. It is mind numbingly boring, weak and bland. There are zero jokes in it. I kept wondering how this guy ended up on the stage with this weak performance. Lame attempts of telling jokes mixed with inappropriate stories. ( Side note: do not shower with your kid!) The laughs felt fake. The stories were sleep inducing and pointless.If this is the best he can do then i don't get his fame. There are better amateurs out there than him. Maybe the other reviewers are right and he was funnier in the past...",False

2,10,Incredibly powerful storytelling,kmwilliamson-88483,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary is a testament to the bravery and endurance of the talented Ukrainian soldiers in the war against Russia. Such an important film to remind us of the sacrifice of the Ukrainians and to resist the empathy fatigue we are all experiencing with so many tragedies in the world right now. The perspective from the established and successful musicians risking their lives to join the resistance against Russia's invasion highlights both the heart and spirit of the Ukrainian culture as well as the power of their music to inspire and support their cause. This film brings light and hope in the face of so many brutalities inflicted upon them. #standwithukraine.,False
3,10,"An incredible journey of heartache, resilience and hope",annajacyniak,n/a,16/08/2025,"Soldiers of Song Film takes you on an intricate journey through some of the darkest days of the war while tieing together the stories of opera singers, chamber conductors and Ukrainian stars like Sviatoslav Vakarchuk of Okean Elzy, Svitlana Tarabarova and Andriy Hlyvniuk of Boombox. This documentary by Ryan Smith beautifully demonstrates the resilience of Ukraine and Her people but also highlights the enduring power of music in times of war.Soldiers of Song captured the deep connection of culture and song for us as Ukrainians and I think it shows the true essence of the unwavering Ukrainian spirit and why even in the darkest hour, in times of pain and destruction... we turn to music... because of its ability to heal.If Soldiers of Song is playing in your city, tell your Ukrainian friends but more importantly, tell your non-Ukrainian friends because the power of music knows no bounds and does not require translation. Make sure you bring your tissues and let the spirit of Ukraine, those fighting and the music take you on a journey of heartache, resilience and hope.",False
4,10,"A powerful movie about humanity, strength, hope, and music - A MUST-SEE",valerykorabljova,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Soldiers of Song"" presents an intimate story of the war shown through life trajectories of Ukrainian people related to the music - from established ""stars"" investing their visibility to garner international support to aspiring talents whose professional development was aborted by the full-scale invasion, or - rather - they suspended it in favour of serving to the people or fighting on the battlefield. It is a very humane movie full of pain and suffering but also full of light and hope. It poses important questions on the fragility of civilization and the importance of art for humankind. Through its evocative power, it helps the audience to emotionally connect with the realities on the ground but also to see broader repercussions of this brutal war. Delicate and genuine, it is a must-see for those seeking beyond national interests and geopolitical calculations to ponder over our shared human condition and the universal meaning of Ukraine's fight.",False

9,10,Should be in everybody's must see list,boryslebeda,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have watched this documentary in Seattle SIFF Central.This movie consists of the personal stories of the people who were musicians and faced Russian invasion of Ukraine of 2014 and then again 2022. The stories are powerful and authentic that really captivating.Generally I believe documentaries are underestimated genre: there is far different feeling when you cannot convince yourself that it is not blood, it is just ketchup.What is also amazing that there are similarities and similar righteous behavior made by a broad variety of the artists: famous and not, pop, rock, classical and folk.I also amazed how good Metallica's music was adopted in the documentary.",False

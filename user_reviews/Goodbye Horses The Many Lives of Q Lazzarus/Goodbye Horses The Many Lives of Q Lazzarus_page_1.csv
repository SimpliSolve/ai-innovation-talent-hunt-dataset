1,9,Equally beautiful and painful.,chamblyman-13146,n/a,16/08/2025,"Goodbye Horses is a must watch for deep music heads and fans of documentaries on underground and ""outsider"" arts. Eva Aridjis Fuentes did a fantastic job of capturing Q (Diane Luckey) and her work. Q was a fascinating singer / songwriter who combined hard rock, soul, and new wave in her songs and focused it all through her powerful, sublime voice (think Tina Turner on the Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome soundtrack.) The film follows Diane / Q from her youthful explosion of musical creativity through a series of heartbreaking tribulations and ""almost"" moments. An equally beautiful and painful paean to dreams and survival.",False
2,10,How is this not a winner at Sundance?,naq-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is outstanding, mainly because the subject, Q Lazzararus (Diane Luckey) is magnificent. She is a force of nature. There seems to be a serious disconnect in the music industry which doesn't recognize a superior talent like this, and it extends to the indie film industry as well. Those programmers at Sundance and Slamdance and SXSW are all falling over themselves trying to secure the rights to secure the productions of rock royalty and are ignoring the work of a significant underground artist like Q. She is miles above any of the winners at the Grammy Awards this past year, and needs to be awarded a Grammy immediately. Her work is completely misunderstood, since she is a black woman fronting a heavy metal band, and the music industry has no precedent for how to market such a phenomenon.As far as the documentary is concerned, it is the unbelievable result of the filmmaker, who is a fan of Q herself, getting into a cab driven by none other than Q herself. How is this possible? It sounds like something that would be considered absolutely implausible if it was a script, yet it was real life. If this is not evidence of the abstract phenomenon known as FATE, then please explain how something so amazing could happen.The documentary is one of the best I have ever seen, and this is written by a documentary teacher, who studies them and presents them to students in major arts colleges, so there is reason to believe that the filmmaker deserves some recognition here. How is it possible that this is not getting worldwide recognition? Oh yeah, because the subject is a black woman who is fronting a heavy metal band. I guess that says it all. Do yourself a favor and see this. Absolutely riveting.",False
3,10,A brilliant and devastating film,lucialoup,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went to see this film with my husband and we were both devastated but also utterly entranced. We feel nothing but admiration and awe for this incredible feat of resurrection of a forgotten artist who deserves enormous recognition. Q Lazzarus was an extraordinary woman and Aridjis-Fuentes tells her story with great elegance and respect. Apart from being a compelling portrait of an artist and of a woman with a personality and presence larger than anything you could ever imagine, it is a complex and layered portrait, not always favorable, of American society. May Q's story and transcendent voice become a part of our lives, may she forever be an inspiration.",False
4,10,My Most Anticipated Film Of 2025,JackW-00,n/a,16/08/2025,"Making a documentary about a woman so mysterious is no easy feat. Diane Luckey, better known as Q Lazzarus, disappeared from the public eye for over 25 years. She gained fans all over the world that she didn't know about. Fans she would never meet. Fans who would not know her presence at all. Conveying anyone's personality can be tricky, but I feel like Eva did it wonderfully. In this documentary, you can pick up on Diane's humor. You can pick up on her passion. You can pick up on her strength. Hell, you can even pick up on her parenting style at one point in the movie! The way this was edited is phenomenal, and once again, editing this was no easy task. Eva has said that (and I'm just paraphrasing here) she felt like she had 2 completely different films. One about a rock star and one about a woman's struggle (especially with substance abuse). That being said, I think Eva was able to make this one coherent story. I applaud Eva for all the hard work and dedication she needed take on the difficult task of speaking for a woman who can no longer speak for herself. We miss you, Q.So what did I think of this film I was so excited to see? I adored it. I still have questions about Q, that may or may never be answered, but I think that's okay! I have never cried so hard at a movie like I did with this documentary. The world can feel so incredibly cruel sometimes.Diane, you deserved better. I hope you're feeling all this love and success that's coming from this documentary. I hope more people are able to hear, learn from, and maybe even resonate with your story.",False
5,10,Eva Fuentes is a great filmmaker See this film!,StacyF-50,n/a,16/08/2025,"Goodbye Horses: The Many Lives of Q Lazzarus is a gift to biographical independent cinema and the women's movement plus the cause for diversity and community. It's truly a global music film on top of being a story of one person or many- her family, friends, her colleagues, the director plays a part- oh- It's fresh in my mind but honestly it's such a wild experience which spans the 20th and 21st centuries and there is so much music and pathos packed into it. I would simply say that each part or scene tells a unique story and then all fit together and form a sensible narrative that makes a compelling portrait of someone we just discovered.",False
6,10,Honest. Intimate. Candid.,CharlieS-446,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn inspirational exhibition about the resilience of the human spirit.A lesson in persistence for artists.Empowerment for those struggling with substance abuse and addiction.Throughout the film, Q's music serves as a prominent character that relevantly underscores the journey through her many lives. Diane's story of success and anguish is relatable to many of us artists struggling to share our gifts. Her story delves deeply into the challenges and incomprehensible emotions that emerge as we follow our dreams. Her life highlights the harsh reality that even with hard work, talent, and love, success may not present in a facet that is easy for the outside observer, or even ourselves, to discern.Learning that a relationship brought about substance abuse that was later exacerbated by heartache produced a dolorous response from my soul. Discovering Q's necessary means of survival during her period of homelessness elevates resentment towards those who robbed her of income from royalties and copyright. The triumph of Q's ability to overcome addiction left me in deep adulation.Her story evokes a range of emotions from sorrow to elation. Diane's gracious gift is treasured in this documentary. Thank you.",True
7,10,Deserves a 10,Vanessamxlx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whoever gave this a 1 is a TROLL.This is an amazing documentary, a great story, and it reminded me of the magic unexpected friendships can bring. It is more than a music documentary as it shows how amazing and raw life can be. The editing and footage was wonderful and the story was woven together with elegance and skill. The deep frindship Q Lazzarus and Eva Aridjis Fuentes really shined and made me appreciate the friends I fell very lucky to have watched this.I have to add that I have been a fan of Q since I was very young. I always loved Goodbye Horses. Now that I have watched this film, this song is even more special to me.",False
8,10,A Must See,imdbfan-0436484401,n/a,16/08/2025,"Q Lazzarus was so gifted and strong and vulnerable. Who knew? Racism and misogyny kept her shining star in the dark and led her to ""disappear"" for 22 years. This documentary was one of the most intimate, honest and sensitive films I have seen.What a beautiful story and wonderful filmmaking, made possible by the uncanny meeting between Q and filmmaker Eva Aridjis Fuentes who just happened to take a ride in Q's cab.A friendship between them was born and
the light was shined on Q Lazzarus. The intimate interviews with Q by the filmmaker had me riveted. The clips of her performances were amazing to see and hear. By the end, I was moved to tears. I hope this film gets the attention and wide viewing it deserves.",False
9,10,An amazing piece of work.,JimB-617,n/a,16/08/2025,"The reason we love films is that, sometimes, they provide us with a reminder that there is magic, still, in the world.Such is the case with Goodbye Horses: The Many Lives of Q Lazzarus - A remarkable - even miraculous - piece of documentary work by director Eva Aridjis-Fuentes who just happened to be the only person who could have made this film at the particular time it came to be.This is a stunning, accessible, portrait of an artist as well as a commentary on our society. Heartbreaking, haunting, and, ultimately, uplifting, it's everything you could want from any film and the fact that it's true to life makes it even more important. Watch it at your emotional peril because it is devastating in the end. Bravo!",False
10,10,spectacular,MoiraM-59,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this film in an art house cinema in Toronto and was blown away. I agree with the reviewer here who said this is THE documentary of the year. Forget the endlessly bland and predictable bio epics about famous performers. This is the real thing. Absolutely authentic and intimate and unlike any film portrait I have ever seen. How could it have not gone to the independent festivals, how could this gem of a film not be written about everywhere right now? I just don't get it. But for those of us lucky enough to have seen this film and discover Q's inner life and tragic trajectory, it will linger for years to come. The music is fantastic too. Thanks to this brilliant doc, Q will never be forgotten. I can't stop thinking about it.",False
11,10,A truly moving documentary,Sjz23,n/a,16/08/2025,"After the first five minutes of the movie I knew I was in for something good. It's a moving and frustrating story told by the woman herself and supported by the friends she made along the way. You never know where the story is going to go, because she has lived so many different lives. You cheer for her and feel her pain. The director met her at the right time. She was ready to tell her story and what a story it is. While watching the film you may, like I did, think what if she made it big in the 90s, what kind of impact would she have on the industry? A great movie, perfectly matched soundtrack. Don't miss out.",False
12,10,Documentary of the year,JW-320,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the most riveting documentary I've seen in many years. Delivered with a delicate touch and intimate footage of a woman whose work was scantly shared in her prime and whose extraordinary spirit had never truly been presented to the world. She never even had a record deal???? It's not only that Q struggled to navigate a music industry that was too square, too racist or too dysfunctional to channel her power, but she managed to remove herself so completely that she had no sense of the impact she had on artists, lovely souls and the culture at large. Her work lived on via a network of underground sharing, piracy and profiteering unbeknownst to her. And it was only a chance encounter in a cab that connected two kindred spirits, causing Q to revisit her past and reactivate the impulse that had driven her to perform since she was a child. Aridijis' love for Q and her passion for Q's artistry come through via intimate conversations and extraordinary archival footage. (Has anyone ever seen this??) The filmmaking is masterfully subtle, but the humanity is immersive, ferocious.",False

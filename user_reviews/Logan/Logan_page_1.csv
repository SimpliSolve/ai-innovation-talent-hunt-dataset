1,9,A comic book film done right,mbhgkmsgg,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gritty, honest and brutal. Just like a movie about Logan should be. This is by far the best X-Men film as far as I'm concerned. Logan doesn't hold back at all which I absolutely loved. For the most part, there is just an onslaught of awful things happening. And apart from the relationship between Laura and Logan, nothing makes you go 'oh, that was nice'.Very early on in the film, I got huge John Wick vibes. The action was very reminiscent of those films. It was fast, it was brutal and graphic, and it wasn't afraid to show everything. Indeed, you got the sense that Mangold was trying to find more and more interesting and gory ways to kill people. Something that the John Wick franchise also does. This comparison between John Wick and Logan is nothing but a positive one. If you ask me, the John Wick films are some of the best action films to have come out in recent years, as is Logan.Where Logan really shines though, is not in the action, but in the story of Logan. It's a depiction Logan that I think a lot of people have wanted to see. Although I'm by no means an expert on the comic books, I have always had the feeling that Logan is a much more complex and difficult character than the previous X-Men or Wolverine films have led to believe. Logan is just as brutal with its depiction of the character as it is with its action.Logan really should be used a case study on how to do a comic book film. The only problem it faces is its R rating. I absolutely loved the rating as it allowed the film to go as dark as it needed and wanted to go. But comic book movies are, of course, supposed to be the highest-grossing films studios make, and an R rating will automatically lower revenues.If you have been looking for a comic book film that isn't just like all the previous ones, Logan is the one for you. As mentioned, it is brutally honest and gritty, and the action is more brutal than you would ever dare to expect. It's a fantastic action film but it also manages to create such an impressive story that you will find yourself amazed with the depth of it.
Is it my favourite comic book movie ever? No. But is it easily one of the best ones? Absolutely.",False
2,9,"""Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long.""",gettodamoofies,n/a,15/08/2025,"FILM: 8.5
Rewatching Logan, I can't help but feel a rush of emotions as Hugh Jackman says goodbye to the role of Wolverine... or so we all thought, including Hugh himself. James Mangold teams up with Jackman for their second outing focusing on Logan, and this time it's a decidedly more introspective event, wholly unlike any other X-Men film. Taking cues from his 3:10 to Yuma remake, Mangold turns this into a western of sorts with sci-fi embellishments, creating a unique and compelling atmosphere.Jackman delivers his most nuanced performance as Logan, portraying a character who is older, wearier, and more vulnerable than we've ever seen. It's fascinating to watch him bring depth and raw emotion to the role, making it a fitting swan song for his iconic character. Patrick Stewart also gets plenty of scope to do something entirely different, and his portrayal of Professor Xavier is both heartbreaking and powerful.Even the plot points that usually come across as generic, such as certain action set pieces, have a different tone and feel in Logan. Mangold manages to infuse these scenes with a sense of realism and grit that makes them stand out from the typical superhero fare. The action is brutal and unflinching, but it never feels gratuitous. Instead, it serves to underscore the themes of mortality and redemption that run throughout the film.What I love most about Logan is how it successfully blends genres, taking elements of the western and the sci-fi thriller and melding them into a coherent and engaging narrative. The film's introspective nature allows for character development and emotional resonance that are often missing in superhero films. It's a fitting way to say farewell to the role of a lifetime... for now.Overall, Logan is a remarkable achievement, a film that transcends its genre to become something more profound and meaningful. For me, it's a deeply satisfying rewatch that reminds me why I love the character of Wolverine and the world he inhabits.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 10.0

3,9,"A gritty, more adult Wolverine film",Tweekums,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is 2029 and Logan is getting old and tired. Most of the mutants are long gone although Professor Charles Xavier is still alive; he too is old though and as his mind goes so does the control of his powers. Logan is working as a limo drive in the area near the Mexican border and is approached by a woman asking him to drive her and a young girl, Laura, to North Dakota. It turns out Laura is a mutant with similar powers to Logan; unlike him though she isn't a natural mutation but one of a group of new mutants created in a lab in Mexico City as part of an experiment to create super-soldiers. When the experiment was judged to have failed the children were due to be killed so their carers are trying to get them to safety. Logan is initially unwilling to get involved but eventually ends up heading north with Laura and Xavier. They are pursued by those determined to retrieve Laura; everybody who gets in their way is expendable.Those expecting another 'X-Men' film will certainly get a bit of a shock; this is not an exciting superhero movie suitable for all but young children. Instead it is almost consistently downbeat with some fairly brutal violence as Logan and Laura remove limbs and puncture skulls with their adamantium claws. There are some genuine surprises as bad things happen to characters one would expect to be safe. Hugh Jackman is great in the lead role, showing a different side to Logan; he is no longer young and angry, instead he is old and world-weary. Young Dafne Keen impresses as Laura; an almost feral girl who makes Hit Girl from 'Kick-Ass' look gentle! There are nods to other films; most notably 'Shane', which Laura watches with Xavier and their search for the possibly mythical Eden in North Dakota reminded me of a different Logan's search for Sanctuary in 'Logan's Run'. I'd certainly recommend this to older X-Men fans but would caution against showing it to younger fans as it is very violent and has some pretty depressing moments.",True
4,10,Perfect film to end Wolverine's story,artgutierrez,n/a,15/08/2025,"This really is one of the best superhero movies of all time. And best of all, it doesn't even feel like a superhero movie. Fantastic story and great acting all around.",False

7,10,"Brutally violent, emotional, and character-driven, ""Logan"" is the Wolverine film fans have been waiting for",TheJediWay9,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""Logan"" is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman for one final go around as Wolverine. With an R Rating secured, something the previous two Wolverine films should have had, ""Logan"" was bound to be fantastic. It wasn't fantastic. It was phenomenal.If you are going into ""Logan"" expecting every scene to just be Wolverine tearing people to shreds you'll be thoroughly disappointed. This is definitely not an action film. There are action sequences in the film, but they are not the main focus of the movie like the previous 2 Wolverine movies tried to make them be. ""Logan"" is a grounded film, a film that really takes its time to tell its story and to develop its characters. It's a character-driven film, and it probably has the most characterization in an X-Men film to date. We get enough of Wolverine's backstory within the first few minutes to really become attached to him (if we already weren't). We learn more about Professor X and what he has been doing, and then there's this little girl, who probably should be annoying, but luckily isn't and that was a sigh of relief. This girl, Laura, is the star of the show. It is really ""her"" movie. All of the sequences with Laura were riveting. There was that sense of mystery to her character that you wouldn't really expect from a film like this. You don't ever really know what her next move is going to be. Her motivation to find a safe haven is so well felt in this film that it just brings you a sigh of relief that there is still a sense of good out there in the world of this film where everything seems dark, bleak, and hopeless.Hugh Jackman's performance. Yeah the dude gave it his all. This is by far Hugh Jackman's best performance as Wolverine. We've never seen Wolverine this vulnerable. He's old, he's broken down, he's beaten. He can't heal like he used to. The conviction from Hugh Jackman in this movie was just spot on and really captured the ways Wolverine felt at certain moments. It added layers to this film. When Wolverine gets into a fight, Hugh Jackman is so good in these scenes it's like he got into a fight with the filmmakers on set.This film does not hold back from a violence standpoint. From the get go, you know what type of movie you are in for. It is brutally violent, by far the most violent X-Men film w have gotten. Wolverine hacks, claws, and slashes his way through skirmishes with blood, guts, and gore flying. If this is what you had always wanted from a Wolverine movie and haven't gotten it up to this point, well this movie gives you all of that.From a violence standpoint, the violence is there when the film calls for it. It is not violent for the sake of being violent. This is a film that puts its characters and story first before anything else, with violence being a secondary element to help propel the story along and to create tension. It is in the scenes where it should be. If this were just an all-out 2 hour and 20 minute ""hack-and-slash"" fest this film would have no depth to it. It would look cool, but giving Hugh Jackman the proper sendoff was what was more important in a film like this.This film at times gets downright emotional. The final scene of the film makes you wanna cry. You care about these characters, you are invested in them. You don't want to see them put in harm's way. Even in the scenes where the film may feel a bit slow, the final act of the film is the payoff. This is where everything really meshes together with a force, creating a pulse-pounding, edge of your seat final sendoff for Hugh Jackman as he retires from the role.This is by far the best Wolverine movie and possibly the best X-Men movie to date. I haven't decided yet. It's up there, and it deserves to be. Everything payed off in this film. It is emotional. It is character driven. It has heart. It is emotional. This is everything anyone could have wanted in a Wolverine film.From me ""Logan"" gets a perfect 10/10.",True
8,n/a,Just A Flat Out MASTERPIECE!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Holy Cow! We've finally got the Wolverine movie we've all been waiting for and then some! Mr. Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman is truly a part of a Wolverine movie that has showcased the true character that the fans had hoped to see full on. Yes, we've seen superb runs and flashes but nothing this deep or this epic.How could any movie fan in general not just adore this film? It brought elements of a lot of great genres.Logan has to be considered genre-defining. The characters, action and story were all beyond outstanding in this movie. We are taken for a ride and can relate to Logan once again. The acting is superb and the dialogue is perfect for the level of each character. Every single character feels believable. You follow the story through Logan's eyes and what a ride it turns out to be.This movie is emotional and moving in every single way that matters and is unique and is as far away from anything X-Men we've seen before. In this case, that's a very good thing. The fight scenes and pace are superb. I honestly could see Oscar nominations here on multiple fronts.This movie is sophisticated and delivers a grand, tragic story. The action fits in nice but serves the story first. Unlike other ""dark"" films, the tone is perfect and fits the character. The supporting characters are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner and are wonderful in and of themselves.I loved everything about this movie and they left it as if this was the perfect end to Hugh's run.",False
9,7,Dark unpredictable with a tragic ending.,ACollegeStudent,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerRating: 7.9Solid, abnormal superhero film that's unpredictable with high stakes considering everybody dies besides Laura and her friends. There were some minor conveniences like Gabriela recording the evidence on her phone which was somehow unlocked allowing Logan to learn the info about laura he needed. Laura driving seemingly the entire latter half of a 2 day trip to Eden. Laura not being there just when Gabriela got canned when she usually keeps a constant watch on her because she's a mutant (possible professor meddling mind there). The father-daughter dynamic was nice and Logan went out like the hero everyone believed him to be.",True
10,10,Logan is everything you wanted it to be and more,badmanlykme,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLogan is the 2017 movie everyone has been anticipating after two great trailers and a R rating it delivers a surprising amount of heart to characters we have grown to love and know and also balancing a surprising amount of action within the first and third act climax, its violent but not blood for blood sake every cut is with reason.Logan presents us with Logan (Wolverine), Professor X and Laura (X-23) and by definition its an escort mission involving X-23 but shes more capable than Logan and Professor X thinks and shes able to fend for herself. Logan is old and a grizzled shadow of what he once was and by going on this mission he unlocks some of the old wolverine inside of him and we see bursts of that throughout the movie, Logan also begins to realize things about himself through the vision of this little girl because they have striking similarities.Every scene in this film feels necessary from the character development to the humor and action nothing is forced everything comes off natural which is a breath of fresh air and I was very pleased with it, I believe that this movie will be very well received by fans as it treats its characters with such care and embarks on an emotional and satisfying conclusion to Hugh Jackmans Logan (Wolverine).",True
11,6,Such a sad farewell.,Her-Excellency,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI really can't get how in the world people are rating this movie as highly as they are. You would think they have never seen this done, and done better.Yes, I understand that Logan is a heartfelt character dear to us, but THINK people! For that very same reason we should be holding this movie to a higher standard, and not giving it an emotional pass.To, me, this film was slow and depressing a-la No Country For Old Men, without ANY of the Oscar-worthiness. It was just droll, SUPER PREDICTABLE, moronic in its' execution and so very far-fetched. (Yes, imagine saying 'far-fetched' for a movie based on a comic)! They spun and bent a bunch of things to get them to where they were in the year 2029 and tried to make it believable (it wasn't). Then, they try to impress upon your heartstrings Logan's connection or ties to the little girl, but the connection or ties are SILLY at best. Not only the supposed ties between them are silly, but the entire plot is full of silly holes.Not SILLY, you say? Let me get this straight ... you are trying like hell to get away from the bad guys, and ummmmm, you STOP FOR A MINI VACATION - not ONCE, but TWICE, and put hundreds of strangers in jeopardy the first time, and a nice family in danger the second time? Yeah, sure. Seriously, anyone who could get over that gaping ridiculousness and who can, after that, in good conscience give this movie anything above a 6 is just messing with you or has total fan-boy blinders on.As for the little girl, god, she was annoying and aggravating AF and 80% of her screen time was spent shrieking. Nooo, not screaming. SHRIEKING.The rest of the acting was good. The members of the family they added as filler in the middle of the movie were the only ones IMO that you kind of cared about. Even old Professor X had seen better days and you kind of wanted it to be over for him. It was just painful to watch, and I don't mean in a moving way where the film is made better, but in a painful oh god, kill him off already way.*** BIG SPOILERS BELOW *** DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE OR ARE PLANNING ON SEEING IT!!!The ending was unreal in how bad it was. Without giving too much away ... you have one little girl who is able to take out like 10-12 guys, PLUS you have Wolverine, PLUS a BUNCH of other mutant kids who have varying degrees of mutant abilities, and yet they can't take out a small group of bad guys?W T H ?As for Hugh Jackman, he was good and played Logan like he always has done except maybe this time he looked older and more tired which was a good thing because it translated unto the screen and gave Wolverine some credibility. Otherwise he was just there. The gushing over his acting this time around IMO is unwarranted, as he really didn't do anything that much different than he has on every other X-Men movie and if anyone disagrees, I defy them to point out what. Props also to the action in the film, and to how it was filmed. The action scenes alone are what I imagine 'made' the movie for most people.All in all, I wasn't impressed.Don't get me wrong - it wasn't a horribly BAD movie, I just don't agree that it was very good and I really don't agree with the overrating or the assessment that it is in ANY way a ""masterpiece"". If you look at it just on paper, you would think that the people that are reacting to it in such a way have ONLY EVER watched comic-book movies in their lives and have now seen a drama sold as a comic-book movie and their brains are exploding as they process it as innovative and different.In closing, I understand that Hugh Jackman is getting older, and the great dilemma was 'how exactly do you keep making movies with an actor who is aging, playing a character who is supposed to rejuvenate or heal'? You don't. You kindly retire the character, as the creators of the franchise have chosen to do. The thing is, they could have really made it to where it wasn't SO depressing and/or bleak with no real outlook toward the future except a bunch of kids you are NOT at all INVESTED in, or care one iota about.A bad ending for a good character, was just bad cinema. RIP Logan. hopefully, at some point you will miraculously resurrect so that you can be given the farewell you deserve.My actual rating is 6.5-7/10, but some reviewers have gone over the top crazy with the 10s.",True
12,10,"If there was ever a comic book movie deemed worthy of perfect, Logan is it.",trublu215,n/a,15/08/2025,"The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.The film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well.The performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.Overall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.",False
13,6,Claw Father,BoilerYor,n/a,15/08/2025,"Much like with Thor Ragnarok, there is a lot of hyperbolic praise thrown at Logan, most of which is undeserved.Previous two Wolverine movies were terrible and the bar is very low, one can't help but feel there's some overcompensating at work. Throwing words like ""masterpiece"" is really pushing it. Makes you wonder if these people watch anything other than capesh1t.A year earlier, a Mel Gibson movie called Blood Father came out with a very similar story, minus the mutants. Now, the accusation of outright plagiarism is unfounded, but Logan, let's say ""borrows"" heavily from it.The movie's central theme is a half-baked allegory for growing old and dying, sprinkled with CGI blood. In order to expand on this allegory, the best thing the filmmakers could come up with is for Logan to fight a younger clone of himself. The intent is obvious, but the result is underwhelming and anticlimactic. An honourable if failed attempt to add some depth to a movie about a guy who has retractable claws in his knuckles and who can heal himself almost instantly.The primary antagonist Donald Pierce, played by Boyd Holbrook is the weakest part of the movie, he doesn't have enough screen presence and his performance is forgettable. The director probably didn't want anyone to overshadow Jackman, but a more memorable villain would've added instead of detracted from the storyline.The last hurrah for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, until Marvel Studios decides they want him to reprise the role.",False
14,4,"Shallow, Tedious and Disappointing",fung0,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe high ratings for this film are based entirely on its sombre tone. That's a great novelty in a 'superhero' movie, to be sure. But it merely masks the film's emptiness - its painful lack of ideas, lack of character development, and total absence of plot.Jackman's performance? As someone once quipped, his emotional range runs the full gamut... from A to B. He looks grumpy and depressed in every scene. In every shot. Patrick Stewart is somewhat more nuanced, though he too is hamstrung by a script that gives his character the emotional depth of a cartoon. Dafne Keen does a great job as Laura, but her character has only attitude - which incompetent screen writers often mistake for character.Visually, the film is bland. I hear there's a black-and-white version. It's always a bad sign when a film's creators can't make up their minds on such a key issue. A film is either shot for B&W, or it isn't. (In the case of Logan, the photography lacks the dramatic contrasts and strong composition that might favor a noir-ish B&W presentation.)Logic holes abound:* After being raised in a cage, Laura turns out to be a competent driver. What's more, she has no trouble reaching the pedals, presumably on account of some stretching power that's not mentioned elsewhere in the film.* Laura is mute for half the film, for no apparent reason. Then she can only speak Spanish. Then fluent English. No explanation.* Laura is often feral, as you'd expect of someone raised in a cage by sadistic scientists. Yet she acts like a normal child most of the time. Ditto for her friends. This quality does not 'develop' as a result of events in the film - it simply materializes when needed.* Laura drives at random, ends up at a completely out-of-the-way building. And meets all her friends. When was this arranged? How did she learn navigation while locked in a cage?* Logan and Laura have a cozy evening with a nice family - knowing full well that they're setting them up for slaughter, when their pursuers come along. The audience knows this instantly, characters in the film don't quite get it.* Logan is dying, we're never told why. Professor X has a brain-cloud, or some such dread condition, also not explained.Missed opportunities are equally plentiful:* Laura's feral attacks are mentioned in conversation, but never really discussed. Logan dismisses them with a couple of heavy one-liners, when they could have (and should have) led to an extended rumination on violence. The film doesn't miss a beat when Laura's friends brutally murder the guy with the mechanical hand. This lynch-mob logic should, again, have been a starting point for reflections that never happen in this shallow, trivial film.* Logan never has a character arc. Wolverine actually has far less emotional range in this film than in the first X-Men movie. His relationship with Laura is essentially the same as the far more developed relationship with Rogue.* Characters are neither built up, nor revealed. To do that, you have to show them in a range of different circumstances, dealing with emotionally or morally challenging dilemmas. In Logan, the only dilemma is how to keep eluding inexorable pursuit so as to stretch the film out past the two-hour mark. Hence the only character trait that can be revealed is dogged perseverance. We get that in the first scene. After that, nothing.* Ultimately, the filmmakers resort to having Logan shaved back to his familiar Wolverine muttonchops. You know you're in trouble when you're counting on facial hair to create characterization. (Or fan service.)* Plot is nonexistent. The film is one long chase. Weak screenwriters often mistake this for plot, but it's a poor substitute: totally linear, predictable, boring. Yes, there have been great 'chase' films (Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway comes to mind.) They take care to incorporate twists and turns, and strong moments of characterization. Logan doesn't. It's just a bunch of stuff that happens.On top of everything else, I had the creeping suspicion that this film was calculated less as a standalone work, than as a stepping-stone for the X-Men 'franchise.' It disposes of two performers who've stated their intent to depart the roles they created. And it seems to pave the way for the endlessly-discussed New Mutants franchise. Ugh. Replacing the people won't make up for a lack of ideas, and Logan shows very clearly how bereft of creative thinking the X-Men cinematic franchise has become.I didn't hate Logan as I was watching it. But when it ended I was overcome by a feeling of emptiness and disappointment. This film lacks both entertainment value and deep ideas. The Marvel cinematic universe badly needs a shot of new blood, but sadly, this wasn't it.",True
15,9,Say goodbye to Hugh Jackman...,ahmetkozan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen Logan heard that his comic book would work in a similar way, my expectation was a little more. Later Logan's first trailer ended me. The tone of the trailers, the selected music, the intensity of the emotion was superb. I did not get my eye from X-23 in action scenes. Very good performance.Sir Patrick Stewart, like Hugh Jackman, is the last time to portray the role of the X-Men in the universe. And gave a very good feeling and left the film with more drama.Logan, beyond his superhero films, a fickle old and sick man. He is constantly showing the struggle with himself. Unlike other films, violence and action are not adorned with visual effects, they are given in a very hard and realistic way. These old mutants are trying to save the children to make the world a better place.It's an action that will be an Oscar nominee from Hugh Jackman. Logan, it's a goodbye we cannot forget for a long time. 9/10",True
16,9,"A fine, fitting farewell to an iconic character, LOGAN is one of the best superhero movies ever made.",shawneofthedead,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLet's cut to the chase, shall we? In every beat, every frame, every moment, LOGAN feels like the Wolverine movie Hugh Jackman has been waiting (and training) for 17 years to make. Set free of a PG rating, this wildly kinetic film has plenty of gore, action and violence pumping through its veins. But what makes this one of the finest superhero movies ever produced is the big, messy, somewhat broken heart beating at its core.Set in a grim near-future where very few mutants remain alive, we meet an unthinkable incarnation of our favourite enclawed superhero: one who's decidedly past his prime. This is not the near-immortal Wolverine we remember, but Logan (Jackman): a broken, far older man who feels the weight of every wound inflicted upon him. His once- formidable body – tattooed with scars that aren't healing as fast or as well as they used to – seems to be failing. It's only his determination to keep the ailing, ageing Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) safe and alive that never falters.The film's plot kicks into overdrive when Logan's fate becomes entangled with that of Laura (Keen), a close-to-feral young girl who brandishes claws and fury as fierce and lethal as Logan's own. As the unlikely trio go on the run, we see echoes of Logan himself in Laura's terrifying rage and the tentative emotional connection she forges with Xavier. It's one of many smart moves on the part of James Mangold, who does double duty as director and co-writer. Bringing Laura into the picture allows him to explore Logan's trauma, regret and hope through the filter of this pint-sized powerhouse's origin story.In effect, Mangold has placed an intimate family drama squarely at the heart of this ostensible blockbuster film – strip the characters of their superpowers and LOGAN would still pulse with plenty of heartbreak and humanity. Logan keeps dragging himself through the world when one suspects all he wants to do is die. Xavier grapples with his own frailty as his once-sharp mind deteriorates and betrays him, again and again. Laura is a tough, tender mess of contradictions: a victim of horrific abuse but also a warrior in the making. Watching them interact – fighting, screaming, arguing, glaring and, once in a while, forgiving – will elicit laughter and tears (lots of tears), in a way that no other superhero film to date has quire managed.That doesn't mean, however, that LOGAN is an entirely joyless, sombre affair. Far from it. It proves, quite conclusively, that films in this genre can plumb the darkest of psychological depths while finding welcome ways to leaven the misery. (Note: this is something Zack Snyder would do well to learn as he continues to expand DC's largely mirthless cinematic universe.) Mangold threads moments of genuine humour into the proceedings – from casual shoplifting and runaway horses, to an ornery old man who refuses to take his pills.The fast and furious action beats in LOGAN are also quite delightful to witness. The violence that's on full, bloody display is dark and horrible, but somehow fitting for this film in which there really are consequences for battles fought and lost. It's only when you see Logan's claws plunging into flesh, shearing cleanly through meat and bone, that you realise just how neutered and family-friendly his earlier outings were. There's a slow-motion sequence halfway through the film, as Logan struggles to get to an embattled Xavier, that's gritty and beautiful to watch – as thrilling as that scene-stealing Quicksilver moment in X-Men: Days Of Future Past. And it goes without saying that watching Laura gracefully spin and slice her way through oncoming attackers manages to be terribly wrong and wonderfully right at the same time.To be quite frank, none of this would work without the incredible cast, all of them doing award-worthy work that will, sadly, be overlooked because their characters have such silly things as 'powers'. It's truly unsettling to watch Stewart dig beneath his natural gravitas to find the shaken core of a Professor X who's semi-consciously losing grip of his mind – the best and most dangerous mind in the universe. Keen is a revelation. Grabbing this breakout role by the throat and making it very much her own, she somehow manages to convey Laura's childish fragility and overpowering strength, often in the same breath.And, finally, there's Jackman. He's been training for and playing the role that catapulted him to global stardom for 17 years now, and he brings everything he has to this final outing as Logan. He nails Logan's physical tics, of course: from his grizzled and aged demeanour, to his rattling cough and copious drinking. But Jackman also takes delight in unearthing the dark sadness at the heart of this once invincible, now vulnerable man. There is a hope and purity in Logan that doesn't always show through his wisecracks, but it shines brightly and unexpectedly here – often in the film's saddest moments.There are a handful of things about the film don't work quite so well. The main antagonists, played by Richard E. Grant and Boyd Holbrook, are largely forgettable – there's not much that defines them outside their nefarious goals. As many viewers may be turned off by Logan's relentless misery and eye-popping violence as those who welcome it.But this doesn't detract from the fact that LOGAN is a remarkable achievement. It manages to be several things at once: a bruising action film, a tender family drama and an intimate character study, liberally shaken through with comic-book sensibilities and a Western or two. If Jackman really is hanging up his claws for good, there could be no better way to bid farewell to one of Marvel's most enduring and appealing characters.",True
17,10,"The Best Wolverine Movie, Hands Down!",jcardella1,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a wolverine movie aimed at adults and definitely not for small children. The story is set in the future and Logan is taking care of Charles Xavier who has grown old and is incapable of taking care of himself. Logan, himself is now older and his health is slowly deteriorating as well. A young girl mutant enters their lives which sets off a story, which is not about super heroes fighting bad guys, but one that is on a more human level. ""Logan"", is a beautifully made X-Men film that deals with themes of importance of family, loyalty, and ultimately how Logan himself deals with new found emotions which he is experiencing for the very first time in his life.This is the crowning achievement in Hugh Jackman's role as Wolverine. It is the movie he and director, James Mangold had always wanted to make. It is a dramatic work of art and for X-Men fans, has plenty of action and special FX which are a definite cut above anything that has been seen before in Wolverine/X-Men films.A MUST SEE FOR ANY FAN AND A GOOD ENOUGH FILM TO STAND ALONE FOR ANYONE!!",False
18,8,A nice revisionist western ending to Wolverine saga,NpMoviez,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWolverine is perhaps the most beloved character from X-Men film series, but his solo outings have been the most forgettable and/or totally stupid. Thankfully, we have Logan to break that trend. Still have issues with it, but I would acknowledge that it was one of the best films in X-Men series.Good : Hugh Jackman gives the most intense and gritty performance as Wolverine in his final film role as the adamantium clawed mutant. I have always loved him as Wolverine, but he has never been so good. Patrick Stewart does the same in his final role as Charles Xavier, and in his part, there's nothing to complain either. Dafne Keen as Laura - owns the film. Loved the kid as baby/lady Wolverine (X-23). The setting feels really different in this movie, compared to those of other X-Men films. It is obvious that they gave a Revisionist Western tone to the movie, which hasn't been done in the genre so far. It acknowledged the fact that it was inspired by Unforgiven, The Wrestler and Shane, which if had not been done, would've made it look like a ripoff. Not a total waste of a film, it has good parts, but still a copied idea without acknowledgement seems bad. Then, there is action. The actions are the best ones in the entire X-Men film series. The choreography is great to say the least. It looks badass, savage and intense. But there's one thing that this film does with action which most action films don't with these days. And that is, have the actions mean something. Every action scene has a purpose. It either sets up a characterization, or aggressively portrays what a character is feeling. Acting, action and the overall story won't disappoint. Also, all the characters are interesting.Mixed : There are some story issues. It feels as if there is a huge story that needs to be told between the altered timeline of DoFP and Logan. We get tiny little expositions for that matter and sound like much more interesting ideas for a better X-Men Apocalypse movie. This made the largely different characterizations feel totally out of place, for both Xavier and Logan. It works for the movie, I like it, but I don't buy it. It felt a lot out of the place and quite confusing with why they were so different. With all the movies in the series, I don't think they have given all the character development necessary for those changes.Bad : Mostly, it's the villain and some logic issues. There's a video narration/exposition which looked professionally edited with great voiceover, but was by a nurse who didn't even have 12 hours to do it, keeping aside the resources. Xander Rice doesn't feel so good of a villain. Nothing to blame Richard Grant, but just not a compelling villain. X-24 does have a frightening presence, I acknowledge that. But all his likeability depends upon the character arc of Wolverine over the years. Just take out the ""humane"" part of the character of Wolverine, and replace it with Terminator's menace. You'll get X-24.Conclusion : It's a good goodbye to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. You can get the unpleasant satisfaction of seeing him die, and it does hit emotional notes a number of times and feel really saddening. But there are story and characterization issues which cannot be overlooked and to be honest, do not make a good sense.Rating.Score : 8.2/10Grade : A-",True
19,n/a,so much more than i expected,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Being a huge X-Men fan, I really hoped this movie would be good and all of the trailers looked amazing, so I went into the cinema with impossibly high hopes, even preparing myself for tears. What I got, however, was an actual punch in the stomach and, like, an hour of crying. This movie exceeded every hope I ever had entering the cinema.I'm actually having a hard time finding any negatives in this movie whatsoever. I wasn't particularly crazy about Dr Rice, but he's such a minor presence in this movie that I barely even noticed him. There are several villains in this movie, Dr Rice, Donald Pierce and X-24, but what I genuinely believe is going fairly unnoticed in all of the reviews I've read is Donald Pierce and Boyd Holbrook's portrayal of him. Honestly, I don't believe we've had such a good X-Men villain since Magneto, and that to me is really important now since we barely get any good villains in movies these days. Villains can be the most interesting part of a movie. I'm excited to watch Boyd's show ""Narcos"" now, and I plan on following his career from this moment on. X-24 is also a much better villain than I expected, serving as a sort of a shadow to Wolverine. Another highlight of the movie was Dafne Keen, the little girl that plays Laura. She is absolutely amazing, and I can't stress that enough.I want to briefly discuss the R rating. Honestly, it adds so much to the movie, and it's amazing to finally see Wolverine cut loose, swearing and slicing people up, it's amazing. And there is a lot of blood and swearing in this movie, which just adds on to this gloomy, gritty feel that lingers over this entire film, further pushing the notion that the dream is dead, that this is the end of the X-Men. It's truly depressing seeing this world where all of your childhood heroes are dead. In a way, I'm almost angry with the creators for twisting the X-Men so out of what we're used to, and that's another thing that I sort of have a problem with, even though nothing really could have been done about it. I don't really feel like the message of this movie, to give up after so many years of fighting, to just kill off everything goofy and colorful about the X-Men and shatter all of our hopes is necessary in a time like this. I think that as goofy as they are, X- Men movies and superhero movies in general just need to do what they were created to do - to raise hope in people that things will get better if we all work together and that we can find a family no matter how different we are. That's an important part as to why X-Men were created in the first place, to show minorities that they're not alone. Now we have a movie that shows mutants, a minority already hated by most of the ""normal"" people being killed off by the government, and I really don't think that's the message that was needed right now. However, ""Logan"" is a typical example of the director giving the audience what they want (a nostalgic, gritty Wolverine road trip movie) instead of what they need. In this case, it absolutely works because everything is so masterfully crafted, the cinematography is beautiful, the performances are amazing (Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman should seriously be up for an Oscar), the action, gore and script are ridiculously good, there is a compelling villain and it managed to hit an emotional nerve for me. I can't even consider giving it a lower than perfect score.I'm excited to see what Logan means for the superhero genre. It's definitely up there with the likes of ""The Dark Knight"". However, this movie can stand alone as something more than ""just a superhero film"", and as I've heard so many times before, superhero movies get old. It's time for a little change in the genre. While I can't say I'm particularly happy with the implied direction that the X-Men movies are taking after ""Apocalypse"" (even though the X-Men are my favorite superhero group ever, though people tend to forget all about comic books and animated series), I'm more than excited to see if they will ever again reach anything close to the masterpiece that is ""Logan"".",False
20,7,Logan: Not the most fitting send off,Platypuschow,n/a,15/08/2025,"After countless delays and due to my stupidly swollen watchlist I finally got round to seeing Logan which at time of writing currently sits at #155 on IMDb's Top 250 list.Though never really a fan of the X-Men movies due to the lack of consistency and shifting timelines I've always loved Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The man has taken the character and made it is own as the likes of Robert Englund did with Freddy and for this reason I hope we don't see Wolverine again as a recast would be a travesty.Due to the high rating, rumours of the film & Jackman claiming this was his last film as Wolverine I went in with very high expectations and truth be told they simply weren't met.Don't get me wrong Logan is a good movie, Jackman is great, Keen is surprisingly competent and the movie flows nicely but it all felt very familiar and rather anti-climatic.Wolverine has become of the most iconic movie characters of the last few decades so if this was destined to be his last film we truly needed something special and I don't believe this comes under that category.Even with fantastic actors like Patrick Stewart, Richard E Grant & Stephen Merchant the movie never came close to reaching its potential and left me more than slightly let down.The ending, arguably the worst part of the film. No spoilers to be found here just wads of disappointment.After 9 films as Wolverine I salute Hugh Jackman for literally becoming a character, all the respect in the world. One does have to wonder if he'd have had as much success if he'd worn the proper Wolverine yellow spandex though!",False
21,10,Best X-Men Movie so far,alouibelhassen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoilerwe finally get the Wolverine we have been asking for, for the past 15 years and it's his last time. Well i guess he couldn't have ended it in any better way as a last farewell to the fans and his signature role. Not only that but it looks like this one blows all the other superhero movies out of the water and i hope you Weebs go pay for your ticket to see this as well instead of watching a cam version online so we send the message that we want more of these kind of movies.",True
22,6,Errr..,macabreube,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAm i the only person who thought the movie was not at all what i was expecting? Apart from the gore, which finally arrived to a Wolverine movie and was nice to see the rest was pretty dull. The story didn't really convinced me. and i understand that a lot of people will start to try and find an answer for the unanswered questions,and those will never be answered. If it was based on Old Man Logan it was very far from the great story that that comic was. If they can't use the characters from Marvel then make something with what they have. A final fight with Saber-tooth would be amazing.The actual Reavers would be awesome with the half-tank character and the full robot one that only has a human head. Anything would have made this story so much better.But no, have to add mutants for a next story. Logan is not a movie for Oscars, it should be a movie for fans who have waited all these years for a closure. It was really a great disappointment for me. Sorry guys for speaking my mind.",True
23,8,Logan is another level,templar77099,n/a,15/08/2025,"The best X-Men film alongside First Class. It felt gritty, it felt real with a sense of dread and hopelessness you don't often see in this comic-book blockbuster adaptations. It should be praised for doing things differently and really pushing the edge with what can or can't be done in the genre. The triangle between Logan, Charles and Laura works as the driving force of the plot, and is very well developed. Logan's character arch is quite pleasant to watch, though obviously predictable. With that said, the acting is clearly masterclass. You can feel the dilemmas, the emotions and feelings that the characters are put through, specially those three. And another thing it does really well is alluding to a previous event - the Charles incident - but never fully explaining it to the audience, leaving you wondering. The action is nothing like you'd expect from a tenthpole - the R rating really makes up for wonders - being quite visceral and impactful. ""Logan"" probably deserved a better villain, although one could argue that the real villain here is not the typical multinational corporation, but the inner demons of the characters. Demons that prevent them from living albeit normal and somewhat stable life.",False

25,2,Well that was bleak.,dannyc-18,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI just finished watching Logan and--oh my God--what a dismal, dreary, dreadful and dumb bit of cinematic nihilism that was. Brutally and graphically and disturbingly violent too.All those tremendous adventures the X-Men had in years past? All the times they defeated evil villains? The camaraderie, the sense of family--of a home for misfit mutant kids? The risks and victories and sacrifices? Yeah, it was all ultimately meaningless.I can understand if they felt they needed to kill off the old X-Men but they did so in such a way as to make every previous X-Men movie and story appear to have been a foolish exercise in futility. A miserable and lonely future awaits, addled and alcoholic, only to be relieved by violent death. Yay.This could have been an uplifting homage to the ideal of what the X-Men were. But Hugh & Patrick & Co. apparently decided they would rather go out with a sad whimper instead of a celebratory bang.",True

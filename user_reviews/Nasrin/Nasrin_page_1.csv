1,10,"An inspiring story, well told. Really puts life into perspective",rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nasrin is an eye opener and really puts life into perspective! This documentary makes you want to jump off your couch and live your life. By the end of it, you'll feel so appreciative of liberties we take for granted.This film is held together by first-hand video footage, calls and interviews with Nasrin Sotoudeh, an Iranian lawyer and human rights activist. The videos have time jumps, from 2006/2008 to more recent ones from 2016/2017. The majority of the movie is in Persian with English subtitles. Nasrin's letters are translated to English, narrated by Olivia Colman. The film also includes interviews with Nasrin's friends and family. The cinematographers keep their identities hidden, filming Nasrin in secret, as to not be persecuted.The film really shows Nasrin's bravery. Videos of her talking on the phone about her cases show how passionate she is about her job. We see her not only as a lawyer, but as a mother and an activist. The highlight of this documentary is when Nasrin goes to protests and stands up for human rights. At the end of the movie, Nasrin's husband states how she will go to prison for the second time as a political prisoner. Her sentence is thirty four years and one hundred and forty eight lashes. We see people worldwide protesting her sentence, from Ireland, Turkey, Spain and the United States. Her sentence was reduced to twelve years and seventy four lashes. Iranian citizens still fight for her freedom.The lesson to be learned from this film is to always fight for what you believe in. Nasrin fought for her clients as a lawyer and continues to fight for change in her country. She has defied boundaries by refusing to abide by the Iranian dress code and to participate in sit-in protests.I give Nasrin 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 16 to 18, plus adults. It premieres at Doc NYC November 11, 2020. Reviewed by Heather S., KIDS FIRST!",False
2,10,A story about one courageous woman's fight against injustice,sonia_lagomarsino,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nasrin is such an important film. It offers viewers a comprehensive picture of Iran, its beautiful landscapes, as well as the heartbreaking plight of its women. In Nasrin Sotoudeh, we see the human rights lawyer in action, but we also learn about her life as a wife and mother. The movie includes interviews with Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, Reza Khandan, Nasrin's husband, and other activists. Nasrin provides a perspective not only of the injustices women and children face in Iran, but it also shows the stark differences between Iran's citizens and the country's leadership. This film made me want to stand up and cheer for the many freedoms I enjoy as an American woman. This is the story of one courageous woman who is challenging injustice in her country, and the film tells it beautifully.",False
3,10,Hope for Human Rights,mnourai,n/a,16/08/2025,"A must watch for all advocates for global women's rights. A human rights attorney, Nasrin Sotoudeh is a strong advocate for thousands of voiceless in Iran's prisons. This documentary not only highlights her strength, but also her softness. Her gentle spirit in solidarity with the oppressed is reflected through the many facets of Nasrin. Her love of art, family, and country, is captured equally to her activism. Jeff Kaufman and Marcia Ross beautifully reflect all aspects of this courageous advocate's life. After watching Nasrin, I was filled with courage and hope.",False
4,10,"An impactful and moving, a very accurately made documentary",nnasserabadi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nasrin Film is impactful and moving, a very accurately made documentary about Nasrin Sotoudeh, the Iran's Mandela and the voice of voiceless in Iran. It depicts the Daily life of this Brave Woman, responsible advocate and defender of Human rights, as well as mother of two teenagers. It does a good job of explaining the full picture of Islamic regime's Violation of Human Rights and Crimes to those of us who pursue freedom, love and peace.
This is also a very powerful documentary if you're able to read between the lines to see what is going on somewhere else in the world.

6,10,"A positive, uplifting movie despite all the obstacles",jalehniazi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh's struggles, as the unwavering human rights lawyer, who has championed the rights of women, minorities, youth and other underserved populations in the Islamic Republic of Iran, has been known to me for years, this movie opened my eyes to Nasrin, the artist, the mother, the wife and the defender of love and compassion. The film doesn't follow a time line, but creates a beautifully woven story of the history of Iran, history of human rights struggles in Iran and Nasrin's own life. You leave the movie, feeling privileged to have been privy to parts of this amazing human being's life and naturally be inspired.",False

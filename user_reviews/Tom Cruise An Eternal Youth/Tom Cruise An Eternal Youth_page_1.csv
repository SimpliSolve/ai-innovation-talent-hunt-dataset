1,3,Just awfull,millekineser,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat a terrible documentary. They are trying so hard, to make his life and carreer into a skandalous story. They twist and manipulate facts, trying to turn all of his succes into failure, in their narative. Portraying him as a religious fanatic. Not backing any of it up with facts. It is just souch a badly produced, badly written, peace of s**t. Someone is very jealous of his succes, it seems. Embarasing. Just awfull. The only reason I am giving it more than zero stars, is that some of the early photage and interviews are interesting. But once they go on and on about how scientology ruined his life and carreer, it just spirales into crazy conspirathy theory and tin foil hats, to me.",True

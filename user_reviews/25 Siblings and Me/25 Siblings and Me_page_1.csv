1,8,Thoroughly Modern Oli...,ianlouisiana,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNormally I might not have much sympathy for a middle class over - indulged 20 - something in achingly - hip Islington bemoaning his lot aided and abetted by his besotted mama, but Oli's somewhat fragilely constructed persona disintegrates entirely when confronted by his recently discovered half - siblings, a shouty, woke, self - obsessed bunch of Americans all of whom apparently were sired by the same sperm - donor, but have nothing else in common with this slightly camp young man whose English sense of irony is entirely wasted on them.
So this vulnerable Asperger's sufferer was shouted at(his relies don't talk, they lecture) and reviled, ignored and finally snubbed by these Wasp clones to whom individuality was clearly original sin.
Smoking desperately and just about holding himself together he ran off from a 'Get together' where he was obviously de trop and came back to England with his dignity intact.
I hope this very nice young man has by now realised that you can choose your friends - but not your family.",True
2,8,"An outsider living on the inside, but what a guy!",johnnynotty,n/a,15/08/2025,"I wasn't expecting this to be so emotional. Oil is a very brave guy. I see how the language that is so common and trendy in the UK can come across so strong and abusive in other cultures. It is a shame he was shut down and told to be quiet and treated as if he was being disrespectful when he was just being himself. Waking hand in hand with a boyfriend in many countries he would be seen as being disrespectful. It's a shame that he's being asked to conform to a the majority. Oli continue to be you and don't let such comments hold you back in life. If your siblings could for a second understand what hold backs you have they would seriously think twice trying to hold you back further. It's extremely clear you are a very kind, genuine guy. You're biological Father was wrong speak to you the way he did, perhaps it's a blessing in disguise he didn't raise you as you would be half the person today that you truly are.",False
3,7,"Dear Oliver, you are perfect already!!!",mehmetoney,n/a,15/08/2025,"Actually, compared to most people who watched this documentary, instead of having the same stereotype, mainstream feelings with others, I really felt happy about Oliver, how wonderful and perfect he is, as he is.I really wanted to send him an email to tell those things to him, but, as it is not quite possible, I thought maybe he would read it up here.Oli, I totally understand how you felt, but because of your age and lack of life experiences, you are having those down moments, as having dilemmas about, supposed to be the guy exactly how society and cultures want. Don't worry about that, you will sort it out over time eventually.But, take a deep breath and look at yourself, look at who you are, and never, not even a second, have doubts about your behavior or who you actually are.Bloodlines may mean something, but not everything. I am %100 sure, that you will have friends with deep connections somehow, but that is not about you actually, it is about luck that you gonna able to meet with them.You are a unique, beautiful, questioning, wondering, clever person, who is trying to demolish all the bs, that our pop culture society trying to impose at our daily lives. All relationships are hard for sure, cause all relationships want us to compromise at different levels. (which mostly comes with age and maturity, if you are not a pop culture stereotype.) But with time, you're gonna learn how to adapt and control them too. (which is not that crucial)So if you want to get mingled with everyone that you meet in your life, that may be a crucial talent to learn. But let me tell you, it won't be worth to get mingled or to get along, with most of the people actually. (unfortunately, most people are, absolute idiots with a low level of awareness) But for sure, you got to learn how to handle them.I hope, you are aware of, you have an IQ, more than most of your siblings total. :) There were a few remarkable personas like Spencer, among your siblings, but even that number is not bigger than 5-6, along with all 26 siblings.So relax, never stress about those issues, have fun, be yourself and rock on!! ;)",False
4,10,Beautiful and Touching Documentary,ue-53660,n/a,15/08/2025,"From the title I wasn't expecting this to be such a beautiful, interesting, unique and touching documentary. It is not about the siblings but about the complexity of family relationships and life. The main character is very likeable and interesting. Beautifully made documentary from the BBC, which deserves more critical recognition.",False

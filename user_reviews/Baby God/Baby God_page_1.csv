1,6,"""The monster is living in me""",paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Baby God"" (2020 release; 77 min.) is a documentary about Quincy Fortier, a Las Vegas doctor who used his own sperm to inseminate fertility patients without their knowledge or consent. As the movie opens, we hear in a voice over ""I was 22 and all my friends had babies."" The lady's quest led her to Fortier's Womens Hospital, and just like that, she had a baby girl who looked nothing like the baby's real life dad. The movie then morphs to today, and that baby girl became Wendy, an investigative cop who orders a DNA kit and much to her shock finds out on the Ancestry website that her biological dad is this Fortier fella... At this point we are 10 min. into the film.Couple of comments: this is the feature length debut of director Hannah Olson (previously a long time documentary producer). Here she assesses the consequences of a rogue doctor who uses his own sperm in his fertility clinic without telling any of the female patients. This is in and of itself a shocking idea, but for some reason the documentary doesn't really convey the shock of that idea. While Olson focuses a lot on Wendy's story, the director also interfaces others who are in the same boat as Wendy. At some point, Wendy laments that ""the monster is living in me"", and when you think about that for a second, that is a pretty tough situation to be in. Towards the end of the film (which runs just an hour and 15 min.), it appears a convention of sorts s taking place where all of the victims are gathering. Signs show which conference room to go, etc. But when all is said and done, it's just one table of maybe 6-7 people who have gathered. Yet Fortier violated hundreds if not thousands fertility patients. Something isn't adding up. In the end, ""Baby God"" isn't a ""bad"" documentary, but instead it feels like a missed opportunity to deliver a blistering indictment against these abuses.""Baby God"" was scheduled to premier at the 2020 SXSW film festival, which of course was canceled due to COVID-19. The film started showing on HBO in December, and is now available at HBO On Demand and other streaming services. If you have any interest in this creepy human interest story, flaws and all, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
2,5,Swing and a miss,NewNostalgicReview,n/a,15/08/2025,There is a fascinating tale of trust betrayal abuse and rape in this dark story somewhere. Too bad the director didn't wanna talk about it. What could have been...,False
3,5,Meh,rachelk-watson,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first half of this doc is boring as heck. The more interesting stuff, that the man was a serial abuser of any and everyone is buried in the last 1/3 of the movie. That is the most interesting angle, yet the film maker comes at the story from a totally different angle that leaves the viewer wondering where this whole thing is going. When things finally get interesting, the movie ends.",False
4,n/a,A hot mess,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a rabid fan of documentaries. I have seen hundreds. But this ranks as one of the worst.It is ""all over the map."" It lacks cohesiveness, on so many levels.I am quite shocked that it is on HBO.By the halfway mark, I found it totally confusing. Of course, I understood the main concept. But interviews come across as haphazard, with no coherent structure.The ""story"" is fascinating, but this documentary is far from it.Structure matters. Don't throw a bunch of ""stuff"" in a blender.I'm giving up. Wikipedia (ugh) will fill in the holes. And when I feel the need to go to Wikipedia, then the documentary has failed.",False
5,6,A very important story,betty_justjack,n/a,15/08/2025,Just too bad it was told very poorly. I kept getting distracted even though I wanted to know more. Wikipedia it is then.,False
6,7,Why did he do it?,jbankscma,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a documentary not a mystery film, so I won't call this review a spoiler.Why he did it was partially answered, but not discussed was that we all want to be known for being successful. Fortier realized that with his sperm mixed in the chance of success increased.As he became known for being successful (with lots of profit to boot) he kept doing what worked... mixing sperm specimens.As mentioned, DNA testing was nonexistent at that time so he knew he'd be remembered for what he was: a VERY successful fertilization doctor.",False
7,4,Disappointing...,aburgan,n/a,15/08/2025,More about the psychological struggles of the offspring than the perpetrator of the immoral acts. Very slow paced and unfulfilling documentary.,False
8,6,at least ...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"They know where they came from, and howcome they being different with a positive or negative digit.was this a sin, and did this man try to act as god? my guess is no and no. of course he made some doe when meeting his patients, but as a financial project its doomed to fail, cause he seems to have bben a superstud on semenquality, and todays tubeed babies usually comes after 3 or 4 tries, costing tens of thousands of dollars each time.had he the right to do it ? no, but he did and im sure 90% of his seminoles have had a happy life not knowing.good docu? well quite average thinks the grumpy old man",False
9,2,Weird,zimamarija,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can't believe that his daughters is defending him, and that he was their personal gynecologist. He even inseminated one? Yuck! Guy was fricking monster! The other two ""doctors"" are idiots too.",False
10,1,Get To The Point.,jamericanbeauty,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOnce upon a time, HBO documentaries were raw and straightforward. Now, they drone on, with a subtle political agenda. 17 minutes into Baby God and you get painfully slow close-ups of rusty sinks and dusty beds of a now-defunct Nevada Women's Clinic and camera close-ups all up in interviewees' nostrils talking painfully slow. I ran out of patience and interest. Instead, I Googled Dr. Quincy Fortier and via an article, I learned in just five minutes he secretly inseminated 26 fertility patients. Two sued and he settled with one in 2001 and one in 2006, and claimed patients authorized a ""mix"". Shockingly, he kept his medical license, never admitted wrongdoing and was never charged criminally. His records were sealed, so patients kept seeing him unaware of his past wrongdoings. He died in 2006, peacefully of natural causes at 94. The end. The article also points out the HBO documentary didn't mention most of this, but did speak on allegations that he abused his stepchildren and possibly inseminated one.",True

12,1,HBO Continues to Churn Out Crap,arfdawg-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Horrible documentary,
Excruiatingly slow and largely stupid.
Example about one uncovering -- ""I always wondered wy my daughter was smart. Not like me or my husband.""Yes, that was really in this garbage.Plus the Baby Doc is dead so there is no other side of the story or even a trial.Just a bunch of people who grew up with a lie they didnt know about until some filmmaker decided to fill a narrative.",False
13,8,Captivating,noeleprud,n/a,15/08/2025,It was a really beautiful film and I was immediately drawn to the story after watching the trailer. The storytelling of this film was wonderful and truly illustrated the emotions and the feelings these children had to feel. The only issues I had with it were minor editing flaws that I saw but it could have also been a styling choice. All in all this was a beautiful film and I would recommend it to anyone who loves documentary's.,False
14,8,Shocking,billsoccer,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMany children grow up not understand how they could be related to their parents. Also, the adopted wonder about their parents. Years ago some started to have DNA tests and discovered they were fathered by a doctor. Turns out they sued to mix their sperm with that of the husband and then inseminate the woman. Apparently this 1 doctor was super potent. Turns out this way to get $ while attending medical school! Then, darker allegations begin to arise - he inseminated women who were being seen for other reasons - such as inflammations! Now we find him being accused of assaulting his own kids!! He's long dead so no confrontation or real insights are possible.
Not sure why the interviews with his descendant were put into this order - would have liked an oldest-to-youngest, but still intense hearing all this",True
15,9,It grows slowly into a nightmare,Mikael-wester,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI guess that what how you react to a film says as much about yourself as of the film. Your expectations also influence you. I had no expectations other than to escape my own boredom. But slowly , what started out like a story I heard before, grew and dimensions opened up that surprised me. I'm a retired family dr and my kids are adopted. Even if it's extremely upsetting that dr used their own sperms during fertilization treatment. Without consent! Here we have a dr that impregnated humans that didn't seek help for infertility! Molesting his own children! Interesting individuals each and every one that speaks. Something like"" even if you have all the facts , doesn't mean you got the hole truth/story."" So true.",True

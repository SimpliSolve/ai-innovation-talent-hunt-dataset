Largest exodus since partition.. a treacherous journey, the despair, the determination, the hunger, the courage.. while most of us, 'the privileged' relaxed at home, keeping ourselves busy with social media, tablets and TVs, or busy joining thali Bajao, Diya jalao to fight the inconspicuous nanoscopic diablo or venerating and glorifying people of certain profession , there were thousands of starving migrant workers who overnight became jobless, homeless due to lockdown were walking or bicycling hundreds of miles on roads going back their homes... This is a Vinod Kapri's film who is a Journalist too . He follows a group of 7 men who set out on a 1232 Kms journey on their bicycles...Hats off to the team who made this documentary ..Gulzar Saab's lyrics, soothing voice of Rekha Bharadwaj and another beautiful song by Sukhwinder Singh .. a MUST MUST see ..",False

1,10,Insanely good.,jeremysloeb,n/a,15/08/2025,"It takes a lot for me to be shocked these days. This film shocked for a number of reasons, and not the reasons you think. To mention them would spoil the surprises. It just has to be seen. Well done, all involved. And to the brave person who is depicted in the film, and shown in censored form, thank you. Your bravery and dedication is beyond words. I hope that the year and half you spent trying to shine light in one of the darkest corners of the earth will be all worth it when people watch films like this and read about it. For those who would wish you harm, I simply ask how do you sleep at night?",False
2,10,Everyone needs to watch it,dionneharber-09585,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI understand that you don't like animal violence and cruelty, I hate that stuff too. It makes me so sick and angry and I want to tear myself apart because of humanity. It's not everyone no but you have to realise this stuff happens everywhere! It's not just in one place. We all need to wake up and look at what is happening. The woman in this documentary literally said they were testing for no reason! It lead to nothing. All that torture and death for absolutely nothing. I don't agree it should be done even if something were to come out of it but the fact they try and justify it by ""creating medicine"" to not actually create medicine is despicable. They are LYING to you! I'd rather them give humans the opportunity to volunteer themselves for testing. It's not fair on these animals. This deserves to be watched by everyone. This incredibly brave woman literally devotes her life to saving these animals and trying to expose the horrors that go on that a lot of people in this world turn a blind eye to.I didn't think this documentary compared to others I've seen, wasn't nearly as gruesome thankfully. There is still animal abuse and cruelty but a lot of things are blurred and there's not a lot of blood. Which is all the more reason to watch it for awareness if you can't stand that stuff because they've tried to expose these horrible people but not exploit the animals which I think is really important because some messed up people out there would watch these for the wrong reasons if it was worse. People NEED to see this. Make a stand! It's not going to go away unless people stand up for it! They will try to silence us, they don't want us to know but we do know and we won't settle for this anymore. Free these animals. Let them have the life they deserve. Who is anyone to determine how a small and helpless creature is supposed to live its life? Why do people think they are above animals? These are the questions you should be asking and the people that do these things should be I can't even say what I want to say completely but they shouldn't be allowed around anyone else or any animal! Please make a stand.",True
3,10,Everyone has to watch this movie,JoseM-7236,n/a,15/08/2025,"Interesting from the first minute to the last one. If you love animals and specially dogs, beagle (like the used in experiments in these places)in my case, you will suffer because of some scenes, but it is necessary to know about these horrible places that experiment with animals. In my opinion Carlota and Pablo de la Chica's team made a great job and bring to the front row a big case that is about to be archived by the Spanish justice, it is very important not only to watch this movie but also to share with your friends and social media, because these animals are suffering everyday and this is the way that their voices could be heard. 10/10.",False
4,10,Powerful and deeply motivating,TheoD-7,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's gripping, emotional, and genuinely motivating. Watching someone infiltrate a space built to exclude them-and doing it with such clarity and courage-is both shocking and hopeful.The storytelling is sharp, the pacing tight, and the impact real. Highly recommended.It's a testament to the woman who dared to go in, to her strength, intelligence, and resilience. Her calm determination in the face of hostility is unforgettable. It makes me believe a better world is possible. I wish there were more people like her: people brave enough to expose injustice from the inside and still hold on to hope.",False
5,10,A profound and unsettling exploration into the dark recesses of humanity's morality.,markthepig-94874,n/a,15/08/2025,"Undercover: Inside the Bunker 2025"" is a profound and unsettling exploration into the dark recesses of humanity's morality, and the troubling sacrifices made to expose the grim realities behind animal cruelty. This documentary poses the distressing question: Is it justified to risk lives, perhaps even waste them, in order to save others? It leaves you grappling deeply with the concept of sacrifice and whether such sacrifices can ever truly rectify the inherent wrongs in our nature.I deeply appreciate the unwavering dedication and extraordinary courage shown by those who willingly immerse themselves in such horrific conditions, managing somehow to refrain from taking violent actions against those who blatantly torture and kill innocent animals. Their restraint and focus on the greater goal are humbling, though profoundly painful to witness.This internal battle resonates deeply with me, constantly triggering thoughts about the flawed nature of human morality. Why even have morality, if we selectively apply it based on convenience or selfish desires? The glaring double standards and hypocrisy showcased here are repulsive, reinforcing my long-held belief that humanity is deeply flawed, driven predominantly by selfishness and disguised cruelty.The documentary magnifies my disgust toward the lengths humanity will go in the name of science, food, and clothing, cruelty masked as necessity. The anger I feel witnessing these graphic realities is indescribable, igniting a fury so intense that I often wish for some form of cosmic justice. I even fantasize about an external force, perhaps aliens, treating humans with the same indifferent brutality, forcing us to experience the suffering we readily inflict on other living beings.Sadly, fighting this battle feels increasingly futile, much like the tragic endeavors of Don Quixote-heroic but destined to fail. Yet despite this despair, ""Undercover: Inside the Bunker 2025"" remains crucial viewing. It exposes harsh truths and challenges our complacency, though it reinforces my personal conviction that humanity's moral compass is irreparably damaged. If I had the power, I would reset this world instantly, willingly sacrificing everything I cherish, including my beloved family and pets, to end such pervasive suffering.Ultimately, this documentary starkly underscores my conclusion: there seems to be no compassionate deity overseeing us-or at least, not the benevolent one we've been taught to believe in. And frankly, if such a deity exists, I fervently hope never to meet him.",False

1,n/a,"Very interesting, but for French audiences only",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The scheme reminds me some documentaries from the sixties, except it was then in black and white. There is an off voice, very monotonous, boring, but the result is definitely not. The diary of a young man, activist for an extreme right wing French party - Front National. But not a shaved head, neo nazi like violent punk member, as it was in the movie UN FRANCAIS, just a quiet but convinced militant for this party. It is quite realistic, engrossing, riveting, it seems so true, authentic. It shows the backstage, the behind the curtain elements which we never hear about. A documentary, but outstanding, for those who crave for political matters.",False

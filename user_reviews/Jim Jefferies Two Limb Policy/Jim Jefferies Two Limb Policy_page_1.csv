1,10,Jokes of the past mixed with morals of today's society,HDDeer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI genuinely don't understand how this one is reviewed so low..I watched 'Bare' back in 2015, I thought it was hilarious, I've watched every one of his specials in between & they did not hold up to bare, I actually didn't really like 'this is me now' or 'freedumb'but this one was amazing, it's the classic Jim Jefferies that you'd expect, he didn't pull any punches this time around but managed to navigate pop culture today / current events in a weirdly respectful & disrespectful way at the same timeI'm unsure how he pulled this off, but through my laughter I didn't think to myself at any point ""he may be in trouble""He poked fun at the LGBTQ but didn't go for cheap shots, he made funny agreeable points in a sarcastic toneHe didn't stray away from the misogynistic jokes, but if you've watched Jim Jefferies specials, id assume you would know, he loves to make misogynistic jokes in all of them, & if he didn't do it here, I would've thought something was wrong with him.He made raunchy sex jokes & wasn't afraid to make fun of himself while doing it.I'm very happy with this one, I laughed almost the full hour & didn't go long without silence.I'm not sure what more people could've wanted out of Jim in 2025.",True
2,4,Missed the mark,GardenAndGully,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have mostly liked most of Jeffries' specials, but this one was just loudly voicing his opinion that no one else has without telling jokes. Joke 1, ""Johnny Cash was the most overrated artist in American history"" He barely elaborates, and just says he fn sucks. He has good timing and his inflections makes things sound funny, but it was not enough to get by on this one. I was hopeful and ready to laugh, but his idiotic takes made it difficult to get through. And starting with his alienate-every-living-person-opinion on The Man In Black just set a bad mood. Sorry Jim, I'll still watch the next one, but this one moves to the bottom of the list for me.",True
3,4,Two Laugh Policy,Kraftkid,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hate to write this, but for me this was his weakest special. I'm a big fan of Jim. I've seen him live a couple times and he is on my short list of favourite comedians. I've seen his specials so many times and this is the first one I don't think I'll watch several times (I'll give it another watch for sure). I know he talked about retiring and this might have been a special too far. I just think there isn't any gas left in the tank.",False
4,3,What happened Jimmy,Vik_Browser,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Jim Jefferies, never missed a special and even this time when it wasn't funny i sat through the whole thing. It's mostly recycled material with a pinch of different jokes. There were barely any funny topics in the show, Johnny cash(even though i am not a big fan), Disability,Old people, Old people with disabilities, and lastly the most used topic Men and women. There was only one time i chuckled and rest of the show was unfunny. Lot of the time setup for the jokes were missing, And show ended on even lower tone than it started. Maybe he has some sorta deal where he has to do a show, material or not. Or maybe he is busy doing other stupid stuff where he thinks anything he say is funny. Well this time it's not.",False
5,5,It was okay...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I do like some of Jim Jefferies's earlier shows, and thus needed no persuasion to sit down and watch his 2025 stand-up comedy show ""Jim Jefferies: Two Limb Policy""It was an okay show with some good laughs, but not Jefferies's best.Jefferies does take command of the stage quite well, as he has always done, and he does feel very much at home on the stage.Watchable, for sure, but hardly a show that warrants more than a single viewing.My rating of ""Jim Jefferies: Two Limb Policy"" lands on a five out of ten stars.",False
6,3,Simply not funny,imdbfan-155351,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPretty dedicated JJ fan. Saw him live in 2022 and 2023. His jokes about politics, society, pop culture or the chauvinistic character he portrays at times don't bother me at all. But this new special was so deeply bad right from the start. Starting with Johnny Cash was just plain weird and not really funny. Also, the premise that he replaced Jefferson Davis in Mississippi is factually not true. Wrong state, wrong person Cash statue replaced. Then he segues into acting is easy and actors suck. But then Ted Danson is great. Sure the Ted Danson thing bit is funny but in the larger context of the first 15 minutes, it gets a shrug. I maybe lightly chucked 4 times in the first 30 minutes which is not what you want when watching a seasoned comedian. I actually stopped halfway through to go watch something actually funny before coming back to finishing the rest.Some of these jokes would have landed better had the energy not been sucked out of the room so quickly. Just disappointed really. If someone were to ask me what JJ specials to watch if they hadn't seen any, this would in the bottom 2.",True
7,2,JUST MEAN,naturenerd,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show took me by surprise at how bad it was. I've seen Jefferies before. He has always taken jabs at people & groups. But this time he came across as just mean. And 90% of the mean jokes were directed at the low hanging fruit of disenfranchised groups. I sat through 80% of it, and I only moderately chuckled at 2 jokes. Beyond that, there were some setups missing from at least a few jokes, and 95% of the jokes were sexual. I'm neither PC nor a prude. I just expected more variety of topics, more cleverness & wit, which he is (or was) capable of. Biggest disappointment in a stand up special from a comic that I had liked & respected.",False
8,1,Mean and not fact checked,Jc-5069,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHe mentions at the beginning of his special that Johnny Cash is from Mississippi and how bad Johnny Cash is as an artist. First of all, Johnny Cash was born and raised in Arkansas. If you're going to attack an artist that people love at least fact check yourself. After that, I could only watch about 10 more minutes. Guys this is crazy. How you're going to start your special out with a lie? Not even that,but how easily it's proven wrong. This is the definition of having more anger than wits.",True

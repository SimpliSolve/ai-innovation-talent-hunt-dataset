1,10,What's up Seoul city!!!!!,janamaged-59138,n/a,15/08/2025,"Of course, I'd give it 10/10. The beginning of the movie is insane when they said ""blaaaackpink.... blaaaackpink"" wowww
Then they started with pink venom. The movie was mixing different shots of different concerts for the same song. Then when Lisa asked jisso to give us a hint for the second song and she said ""wohhho"" whishled amazinggggg. Ending with bombayah and their words in the finale.""May this moment last forever as we'll be together forever"" _Jennie Kim

2,10,BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA,ArkhamQuinn,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a musical concert cinematic experience that I'll never forget.The quality of the cinematography and editing were top notch and everything flowed so well.I've seen a couple of complaints online about how this film didn't provide any behind the scenes footage or interviews.But nowhere was that ever announced to be a thing?It's a shame that some people out there went in with expectations of something that was never meant to be.But hopefully more people will take this for what it was, an epic and energized concert for all us BLINKS out thereAnd what can I say about BLACKPINK themselves??Lisa, Jennie, Jisoo, Rosé; they were all absolutely amazing <3Loved this movie!",False

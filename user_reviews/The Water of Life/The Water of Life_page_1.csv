1,9,Snapshot of an art and industry in flux,jpopecardoso,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary about Scotch whisky is fascinating, but not only for enthusiasts of the spirit. The film certainly radiates love of its subject matter and setting -- the camerawork fairly oozing a sort of yearning. But it also tells the compelling story of a single distillery as it attempts to reinvent itself amid consolidation, booms, busts, and an ever-shifting consumer profile. A must-watch if you're an epicure with a dram in hand, but also a compelling case-study for entrepreneurs and marketers.",False

The people, their stories and the love of whisky.",dohrt,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie presents the passion of whisky by those who distill the Water of Life as well as the many who partake in a wee dram now and again. For many, drinking Scotch Whisky is about the journey looking for your favorite dram.

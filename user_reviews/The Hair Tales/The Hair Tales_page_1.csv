1,8,Not Inclusive Enough,leegloverholloway,n/a,16/08/2025,"Overall, this was needed as a beginning point. The issue I have as a 60 year old Black American woman is the age groups. I've noticed as I made 50 years till now the media's ONLY interest is for younger age groups. HOLD UP! Women over 50, over 60, over 70+ are here and I wished the producers placed equal focus on us . My generation seems to get overlooked especially in topics like this.Ask me, ask us what we went through and maybe continue to go through.Also I never heard the question of what Black men say to us and about us that also is cultural-conditioning that in a lot of cases has harmed Black women.",False
2,5,**This series does not represent the experiences of all black women**,MrSweatyNapkins,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Hair Tales tells a story from the side of celebrities who only touch the surface of what hair means to them, their hair journey. They speak of hair as if it were a person or personality. Its an overall dry experience compared to if this were told by someone with a background in history like Dr. Tiffany Gill. If this series is supposed to empower black women and their hair it falls flat. It doesn't have a personal feel and seems scripted. The pauses for dramatic effect are a bit over the top.It would help others who are not familiar with black hair and be more relatable to those with it if random black women from different backgrounds were able to share their experiences with a bit more history added.",False

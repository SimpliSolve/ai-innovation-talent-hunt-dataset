1,5,Lost its way in the middle,SoumikBanerjee1996,n/a,16/08/2025,"All of it began on a rather promising note, yet that potential quickly faded away after a short period; the only reasonable explanation being its sheer inability to accentuate the core drama that was meant to exhibit alleged cannibalistic practices done by our main perpetrator aka Raja Kolander!Whilst it does a commendable job in terms of the research done on the man and a pool of offenses he had presumably committed (not yet proven in court, the trials are still ongoing); additional commentaries on his political, and societal ambitions become all too jarring and subsequently come to the detriment of the essence of the narrative!",False
2,7,The series sees a contextual (and visual) improvement! [+65%],arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"Compared to the first, the second entry in the Indian Predator series boasts a a better, more well-rounded approach to the crimes, the perpetrator, and the underlying socio-political context. Of course, it packs all the shock value this story can possibly offer in the form of gory imagery, fast cuts, and interviews with police officers who add to the killer's indomitable aura.The best thing about the piece is that we get to hear from the killer himself, who speaks in a cool-headed but frequently allegorical manner. It becomes clear that he's living in a fabricated reality of his own - one where spirituality, social power, and a criminal justice system co-exist to produce desired results. This is further established through interviews with a clinical psychologist and an anthropologist.It did need more insight into the titular ""diary"" that gets mentioned throughout and the names involved in it, including clarity on each person's current status. That would have given the viewer a more wholesome perspective. Nonetheless, it is a compelling watch for anyone interested in the true-crime category.",False
3,7,Chilling story of a remorseless serial killer!!,sanjubhat,n/a,16/08/2025,"#sanjuzzreviews #indianpredator #netflixindiaThis series is a documentary based on true events in the early 2000's.A journalist mysteriously disappears during the MahaKumbh festival. The police conduct a thorough investigation and a suspect is identified & apprehended by the police.He admits to the crime & the case is about to be closed. A routine search for the firearm conducted at the accused's farm house leads police to his diary which has 13 other names in addition to the journalist's. This is just the start as skeletons tumble out of the closet (literally) with a link to serial killing & cannibalism (yuck).The series gives perspectives from both investigators as well as the killers side.Dark and chilling!! Decent one time watch!!Enjoy & let me know if you enjoyed them

4,6,Horrifying story!,rabbi-75135,n/a,16/08/2025,"Indian Predator The Diary of a Serial killer is really horrifying story! If you are looking for a horror movie i think instead of looking other you should watch this series which is based on real true events. I do not know if this series limited to three episodes in a single series, because somehow i think the series is incomplete, so many things may be left to uncovered! I watched another season which is different and same thing with the other one also! I do not know if it is like this normal. By the way the series is really very interesting true story!13 Aug 2024

5,10,Depiction of reality !!,ayushpandey-85953,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show is a genius as it depicts reality in the most cinematic way rather than focusing on creating sheer drama. And the background score also just adds to the overall effect the story tellers want to cast on their audience.The show also tells us the basic problems Indian criminal justice system has and is revolutionary in that way. Honestly, I see this as a show which needs to be taken much much more seriously and should be wildly popular because it has the potential to change the view of our lawmakers and the whole society on how they view crime and what needs to be done to improve the present state of India.The show definitely deserves rave reviews and all the recognition be it any of its seasons. I have watched all of them and its hard to decide which one is my favorite as they all are so brilliantly made.The show directly talks to the people and the government of India telling them these are the problems please cure them. No movie or show has done it so brilliantly yet and people need to see this more and more. 10 on 10 on everything from my side !!",False
6,8,Definition of a monster,sulemansaeeed,n/a,16/08/2025,"Indian Predator: The Diary of a Serial KillerA guy named Ram Niranjan who had changed his name to Raja Kolander, from Kol community, who committed the most heinous crime by killing 14 people allegedly. Firstly, he killed a journalist, after the investigation at his farm house, police recovered a diary named Raja's Diary which shows he had also killed 13 others. He also cut their body parts and spread them at different locations in the city.I always wonder how brutal a human being can be, why. But later on, after the arrest, he continues to deny all the allegations against him. He is still spending his time in jail in Uttar Pradesh.He also ate the bodies of people he killed, and boiled their brains and intestines and drank it like soup. Because he felt like he would get the powers and abilities of those dead people, which is totally a psychopathic behaviour, no doubt in that.Although charges of cannibalism against him were not proven, he along with his wife Phoolan Devi and his brother in law, are in jail for life imprisonment.",False

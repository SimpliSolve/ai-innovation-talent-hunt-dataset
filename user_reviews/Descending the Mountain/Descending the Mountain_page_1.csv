1,2,"A complete mess, not What I spected",urkus,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a mycologist, I thought that I was going to see something interesting; also as a consumer of psychedeleic Mushrooms, I thought ""wow this is my documentary!"". Then I started watching people talkng with the nature, things that I know about fungy, they get together, you don´t understand why?? You don´t understand the editing of the documentary that is acompletely mess. What is it about? Old people taking young people into the psychedelic world.... NO!It was horrible watching it, not funny, not understandable, not entertaiment, no new information... I was bored by 32 minutes in the film; I though... well It is short, only 78 mnutes, but it looks like 3 hours of nonsense. Don´t waste your time with it.2 Stars out of 10.",False

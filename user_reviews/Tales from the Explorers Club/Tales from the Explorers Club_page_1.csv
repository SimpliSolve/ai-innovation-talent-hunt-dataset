1,8,"Great Idea for a Josh Gates production, and well done.",rebekahrox,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a fan of Josh Gates since Destination Truth. I was not disappointed in this new series. So far it seems that each 1 hour episode features 2 to 3 accounts of famous adventures of members of the prestigious Explorer's Club. I really like this as his Expedition Unknown episodes tend to get a little long and drug out, as much as I enjoy them. Plus the emphasis on treasure hunts, Nazis, and Egypt tend to get repetitive and a little tedious. Josh's favorite refrain of ""Oh my Word!!!! When finding something *not* what he was looking for is fast approaching drinking game status.Although the true life adventures are famous and have been explored many times, so far I have learned things I did not know before. I didn't realize that Edmund Hillary and Tensing Norgay were the second string team, who only got their chance because the first choice team's oxygen system failed. I didn't realize Robert Peary was such an egomaniac nor that his right hand man was black. The story of their rift was new to me. The latest episode about the Kon-Tiki was quite exciting, as all of the episodes have been so far. And again, much was learned from that and the other two stories in the show.Finally, while some part of me admires the fact that the producers didn't edit out or avoid showing the elephant tusks that prominently adorn the Club headquarters, Its a bit cringe to say the least.",False
2,10,Full of adventure and amazing!,Sam-Search8,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every episode ventures into the explorers club and the thrill of adventure. Each show tells of unique people and there extreme spirit in exploration. I recommend the series to everyone. I hope there is a second!!Those who gripe about money and call it boring need to look further than a short attention span and areas of money. Each episode educates and encourages new exploration, if you want to bring your wallet with you, go ahead. That is not the impression or the focus. The focus of the series is to tell of ordinary people who have an extraordinary unbound spirit to chase the unknown.Give the series a chance! And have patience to hear a story and let history inspire you.",False
3,3,"Might as well be called ""Billionaires at Play""",christycarol-26373,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was hoping for more stories about the major explorations in history, perhaps with archival footage, but instead it seems to showcase and focus on modern day billionaires as Josh Gates promotes the exploits of his friends and what they can do with a few billion dollars, rather than showing the stories of tenacity and survival that explorers 100 years ago had to endure, before the age of personal spaceships and deep sea submarines. I want to be inspired to go out and explore by this show, but instead all it does is motivate me to find the next crypto or IPO to buy. Should've made more ""Legendary Locations"" and left this one alone...",False
4,5,Big Explorers Club Fan! But The Series is Kind of Boring.,collectorofsorts,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm an old man and have been reading about the Explorers Club since I was a kid. People are still talking/writers are still writing about their legendary 1951 wooly mammoth dinner. But I was bored by the first two episodes. The narrators voice is loud and droning. And, instead of using historic footage, they use modern day footage. It's really disappointing for this huge Explorers Club fan. Hopefully the final two episodes will be better. If it is, I'll come back and update my review. But I'm not expecting it. They're following a pattern with the show and I doubt they'll change it halfway through the season (four episode season). It's an okay watch. That's about it.",False

1,10,We found a real actor,rohit-81569,n/a,15/08/2025,"Vikrant Massey what an amazing performance. After Irfan Khan it is the first time I have seen such a real acting on screen. Keep doing such films.Simple story-telling, no bollywood masala and reality at its peak. Vidhu Vinod Chopra has done justice with the script. This is the difference between experienced director and know it all ""directors"". Yes, I am talking about TVF guys. 2 seasons and they literally have made a mockery of IAS struggle. They should watch this and learn from the best.I just hope now that Vikrant gets a best actor award for this. He deserves it.That ""restart"" song is gonna stay in my mind for long. And yeah huge round of applause at the end in the theatre. Go and watch it, please!",False

3,10,Simply Outstanding!,saviotr,n/a,15/08/2025,"First of all it is important to thank Vidhu Vinod Chopra for making this film. The story has been told in such a heartwarming way that the audience is totally involved in this inspiring story of grit, determination and victory against all odds. The performances are award worthy. Vikram Massey is outstanding in the lead role and is well supported by the rest of the cast. The direction, screenplay and editing are top notch. Unfortunately in India the over the top and illogical films become blockbusters and the really outstanding films don't do well commercially. I hope the Indian audience views such films as it will encourage film makers to do top quality work of international standards. This film falls in category that the Hindi film industry should feel proud of.",False

9,10,12th FAIL:-A inspirational journey you need to watch,puranjanbasak,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler12th fail is a bigraphical drama film directed by vidhu vinod chopra.I cannot explain to you what level of performance i have seen from vikrant massey. Its national award worthy. His every expression, dialogue delivery, mannerism, everything was pitch perfect. When he broke down in the final scene out of happiness, a piece of heart smiled. This actor deserves all the accolades. Another actor to applaud is medha shankar. First of all, I could not take my eyes off her, she is that pretty. And her peforamance was prettier. Her dialogue delivery and expression is on point. Anshuman pushkar plays the sandeep bhaiya, sad at his peers' misery and joyous at their success. I guess we all deserve a shraddha and gauri bhaiya in our lives, if we ever have the courage to go through what manoj kumar sir had to.The writing is brilliant, and nothing else. The characters it sets up is outstanding. We feel for them, smile and laugh at their success, break down when they break down, thats the example of finest writing. The screenplay is engaging, despite taking care of very minute details. The editing of the film is sharp, the way it captures the mindspace of manoj's first impression of mukherjeenagar is brilliant. The cinematography is brilliant, hand held shots, long shots, the use of real locations gives us the authentic feel that yes, the characters are real, the world is real, the struggle is real.The social commentary on our education system and its flaws is criticised severely. Every person has a different struggle, you have to fight through it. This is a very special film, if you feel, watch it in theatres, it deserves more love.",True
10,7,Very Good (from an American),rickspung,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm a Texan who enjoys foreign films. I have a soft spot for Hindi movies and TV series. Just finished this and it's good. Maybe not 9.2 good, but still good.I liked the fact that it is based on two real people, and there were photos of them during the end credits.The acting, dialogue, scenery, editing, music, editing and plot were all well done. I got sucked in, emotionally, and everything felt real. That's the difference (for me, anyway) between something I'm going to stick around for, verses something I bail from in the first few minutes.Not much more to say. Didn't expect my eyes to well up at the end, b/c I'm not usually that way. But it happened.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",False
11,3,Filled with cliches,kirk781,n/a,15/08/2025,"The film is replete with cliches that have been done to death. An apparently ideal individual, who according to the film, only sleeps three hours per day and works/studies the rest; fails in all his UPSC attempts except for the last and even then, goes on to completely derail his interview before you guessed it, magically passing. Standard melodrama that has been done to death. Add in a love angle, some corruption angle and you have a film. The film also tries to tangle you in with emotional melodrama but in the end, feels all kind of soapy.I couldn't care what happened to the main character, because well, the director made it clear from the get go. The acting's decent but that alone doesn't make it clear why this film is rated so high. I have seen tons of Hindi films that are much superior to this and honestly, this is skewing the rating trend a lot.",False
12,10,An excellent watch. Made for everyone,Kornephoros,n/a,15/08/2025,"Superlative acting by each person in the movie, even those playing much smaller roles. The fact that it is based on a true story makes you really understand and appreciate what the person went through and how he achieved it. Dadi is awesome 😎Vikrant Massey plays the character with such ease. Do read how he prepared for the movie. It reminds me of Aamir Khan. Medha Shankar, Anshumaan Pushkar, Anant Joshi have portrayed their roles beautifully.The storyline flows effortlessly from the beginning and the narration by Anant is superb. What you also live through is the hard work that people put in while preparing for the UPSC exams, especially those coming from far flung villages of the country.A movie that you would definitely want the kids in the family to see. Congratulations to the entire cast and crew. You have delivered a masterpiece !",False

I watched... not exactly watched but began and left in the middle of many movies because I didnt like most.But we really have a gem here! This is one of the most inspiring movies I've ever watched. And I feel this is the real soul of India we see here, not the over-exaggerated thug/gangster/corrupt politicians movies which are like carbon copies.Vikrant Massey should be an international star and also I'll try to follow the future works of the director.This is not only about India.

15,10,Unbiased movie review,shaktirajsingh-29730,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is such an inspirational-realistic and depicted with cast full of natural talent. Hats off to Vikrant Massey for portraying a practical and real character. One should watch this movie in nearby theatres so that more such kind of movies are made in the future.It's trailer itself is eyepleasing, but believe me the entire movie is much beyond the trailer and the fact that it's based on true events make it one of the finest movies in the Indian cinema.It's a must watch movie for all the youths despite the fact that you are preparing for UPSC or not. You'll get to know that reasons for not putting proper efforts in your preparation for anything is not the things you tell to others it's just inside yourself. If you decide to do something then you'll definitely achieve it with positive mindset. All these things are depicted much better than the words I wrote here.",False

19,5,Slow and predictable / non Indian review,danielsasso-29026,n/a,15/08/2025,"Could not finish this, gave up halfway.I assume it has a happy ending as all Indian movies do.Typical aspirational plot about a country mouse trying to make it in the big city.Acting is terrible, and this is the main reason why I gave up. The protagonist has the exact same expression in every scene: an annoying grin.Also, it is slow. Really slow. Editing is poor with lengthy and unnecessary pauses.

23,8,Vidhu Vinod Chopra has got some real movies up his sleeve,vinaygupta-03300,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWow! This is one of the rare movies that actually made me cry. Tears were rolling down my cheek by the end of the movie and head was heavy with dizziness. Keeping philosophy of the movie aside, as far the cinema is concerned, it was an absolute brilliant. I would say that not only Vikrant Massey but all of the actors did phenomenal work. The innocence of Medha Shankar is enough to make anyone fall in love with her. BGM could have been a little better. Cinematography is nice and overall, movie sticks to realistic plane.The story that shows the story of struggle and success touches you deep within. You feel for the character since the beginning and celebrate his success as if he were your peer. The bonding the character manages to develop is amazing. We want him to succeed. And at the end, when he indeed successes, what a beautiful scene it was. The way both he and Shraddha rolls down crying. The way Manoj goes back to Dushyant and thanks him, the way he calls his mother, the way his father feels proud. It was all so great.Another scene that stuck with me was, when a character fails his 6th attempt, he opens his tea stall and start guiding others. It was so easy for the director to show that he committed suicide, after all the buildup that the movie attributed to him. But it was a nice gesture. But then there is a scene where that tea wala bhaiyya lectures the English medium student. That felt a bit too over the top and unnecessary.Romanticise upsc
Imaandari
English medium look down uponNow coming to philosophy, this is where I have got some problems with the movie. In my eyes, the movie unnecessarily romanticises UPSC and works as a motivation detox. I am not a huge advocate of motivation industry myself. So, I didn't find the motivational undertone very becoming of the movie. The movie stresses that one should never give up and should always restart and that is all fine, but without a proper subject and rational of thought, this becomes just blind motivation.Then, the whole subplot about honesty. I guess the movie handled it nicely and neither became a cynic nor too preachy. I thing I didn't like that the movie glorified the poor while showing a negative sentiment for the English medium privileged kids. Honestly, I am quite fed up of this constant undertone in all Bollywood movies. Indeed the poor ones who makes lot of struggle to make ends meet and yet continue their battle deserve our utmost respect, but if the means to glorify them is to look down upon the privileged ones by showing the stereotypical rich rude kids, I don't think it's justifiable. Both rich and the poor has got despicable people that has nothing to do with their economical status. So, I didn't find it very welcoming from a director of the intelligence of VVC.Keeping these nitpicks aside, this is indeed a very well made movie glowing with the extravaganza of heroism. If you liked superheroes in your childhood, this is the one movie you should look up to.",True

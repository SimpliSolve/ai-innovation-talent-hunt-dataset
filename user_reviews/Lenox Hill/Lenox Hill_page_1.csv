1,10,Absolutely Fascinating Personal and Real,genious-35413,n/a,16/08/2025,"To all of the people who say they like reality shows - THIS is actual reality. Not The Bachelor or the Real Housewives of wherever.and certainly not anything to do with Kardashians. You not only see what these people have to deal with in what their job is, but you also see what they have to deal with that ISN'T their job. And you fully see medical procedures, surgery, birthing... and that's all in the first episode alone. This show will give any viewer a new-found appreciate for what these people do and how much they sacrifice for others.",False
2,10,Absolutely Exceptional!,michaeldebotton,n/a,16/08/2025,Lenox Hill is the best docu-series I have ever seen. It is so real as you are literally in the OR during brain surgery. It is so fascinating to see how well these doctors work together and how well they treat their patients! Cannot wait for season 2!,False
3,10,One of the best TV shows I've seen,teoandreea-07655,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't watch reality TV shows. Just not my type, especially after associating them with the Kardashians or Wifes ""something""..
Even reading a bit of description of it being about working in a hospital. But anyway, I was really stressed one day so i just pressed play on Netflix. To run it in the background while I was finishing some work.
Wow! I can't even write on the qualities and the faith and respectbit gave back for the hard work, ethics, humanity the medical staff show throughout the episodes.
Not only that is entertaining, but is also educational(!). Im addition to this, I was very hooked also on the cases they show throughout the series. With the permission and support of the patients and their families we can actually witness the real hopes, fears, joy and tragedies the families and medical staff are going through.
A big round of applause is in order for the patients, their families, medical staff and the producers of this show!",False
4,10,Please tell me there will be more seasons of this series,karenlogan-18207,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a lovely peek into the human side of being a medical professional. All the talent, publications, money and glamour doesn't change the fact that they are all just human beings who need love and encouragement and some compassion just like the rest of us. Well done",False
5,10,Excellent physicians,cockezville,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, I have such respect for all these doctors. What a well implemented reality show that shows the real operation of a hospital, the integrity, heartaches, headaches and joys of being a physician in a wonderfully rich hospital. This was fine tv! Thanks!!!!",False
6,10,Wow! Well worth your time.,kristin-05709,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can't recommend this enough. It's riveting- full of beauty, pain, sadness, hope. These docs and these patients will stay with you long after you finish watching. I've been an RN for 31 years, but away from the bedside for a decade. This makes me ache to go back and reminds me what a privilege it is to do this work.",False
7,10,Real life Grey's Anatomy,alekasmail,n/a,16/08/2025,"A must watch. I cried, I laughed, I got angry. It was good to see motion from surgeons. I always feel like they're complete robots but to see them feel & cry got me so emotional.",False
8,10,Wow! Such a privilege,idris-13802,n/a,16/08/2025,I feel privileged having almost a firsthand experience of what goes on in the world of medicine and surgery. I particularly like the way they also follow the personal lives of the doctors themselves. Well worth your time!,False
9,10,Great show finally real reality and of the highest quality,talwf1,n/a,16/08/2025,The creators of this documentary are absolutely geniuses. The people are inspiring. It's really interesting. What a great work! I can't wait to see more of what they have!!,False
10,10,Amazing!,prestonrogersbrown,n/a,16/08/2025,Have just watched the entire series with my wife back to back. Real like issues with the most amazing people who do every day try a save lives! Highly recommend!,False
11,10,As a caregiver of a GBM patient,christinadoucette-26639,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thank Netflix and the neurosurgeons in this documentary for showcasing Glioblastoma. No one wants to have anything to do with this cancer and yet, we have to live it. I hope this documentary helps people to understand this cancer as well as inspire others to help find a cure.",False
12,7,A Real Reality TV Show,joncheskin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lenox Hill is a reality documentary series following the daily lives of four physicians-- an ER doctor, an Ob/Gyn and two neurosurgeons, at the Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. The show gives you a great sense of the day-to-day for these professionals, which include both long hours and highly stressful and emotional situations. The ER doctor and the Ob/Gyn have an added storyline in that they are both pregnant through the span of the series and get to experience the system as patients themselves. The last episode is something of a bonus as the show revisits three of the doctors as they cope with the initial stages of the Covid pandemic in New York.This show is real life and then some. We get to witness several live births, a whole bunch of harrowing brain cancer surgery, and an incredibly unpredictable parade of patients through an urban ER. Some of the scenes are heartbreaking, especially those when one of the neurosurgeons has to explain to a cancer patient and their family that they have exhausted all options. Some scenes are triumphant, as especially two neurosurgeons are cutting edge practitioners who do miraculous things to save their patients. Everything is fascinating, as you get a really good sense of what life would be like for you if you had followed your parents' advice and become a doctor. I feel actually rather lucky that these professionals have invited everyone into their world to see what their lives are like.",False
13,5,"Very Interesting, but an Editing Failure",chron,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are some good story lines in this documentary. it is well-directed and doesn't fall into the trap of other medical documentaries of only focusing on the success stories.The were well-developed stories on the care-givers that were easy to follow. The stories on the patients were more fragmented, and the editing created problems for me to follow all of those. A couple patient stories were well-told.It was worth the time, but it could have been better.",False
14,10,Amazing,vasiliskaragiannis-73862,n/a,16/08/2025,It's actually the best medical documentary I have ever seen !,False
15,9,"Touching, moving, an incredibly emotional watch",fiorelalazaro-65738,n/a,16/08/2025,"About to enter my first year of medical school and this was really touching. Gives me a lot of motivation and drive and just awe at the whole medical community and the wonderful work that they do. People are so layered and so complicated and this was an experience of that. Great series, really well-made.",False
16,9,Wonderful! First rate!,barbaraaosborn,n/a,16/08/2025,"This docu series is truly spectacular. Rich story telling and beautiful cinematography. I love how NYC is treated like a 5th character. Wonderful to see the frontline caregivers before Covid which makes you realize they were heroes all along. Would love to see a season 2 to see how the biggest healthcare crisis in recent times impacted them, their patients, their community and their hospital. Well done Netflix.",False
17,10,Profound!,scizekwood,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just watched this series and I am deeply impressed! The love and compassion these teams have for their patients and each other is amazing! I hope this series continues!As a retired Social Worker, I would like to see the staff reach out to them for themselves and their patients.",False
18,10,Incredibly Compasionate,steve-jaws,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dr. David amd Dr. John are, in their own unique and loving ways, two of the most caring amd compassionate people. They truly are devoted to their field without aroganance.Really, really enjoy the show",False
19,10,.....WOW...... Just WOW!,msmoothe74,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an incredible show! An emotional roller coaster in the most realistic sense. The highs the lows the happiness and sadness. The laughter and also anger, you will feel it all. If you don't feel completely and utterly in awe of these phenomenal people then there's something wrong. I have always been so intrigued and interested in the behind the scenes ongoings of hospitals and the medical field in general. Seeing these talented and gifted doctors doing their jobs and so much more is a beautiful blessing. I feel honored to have been able to ""get to know them"". I truly hope there are many more seasons bc this was fantastic.",False
20,10,EXCEPTIONAL!!!!,gclucas-31410,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been a HUGE fan of medical shows such as Grey's Anatomy, ER, New Amsterdam, etc. and I have to say that Lenox Hill was AMAZING!! This show was well put together and truly portrays the day in the life of these docs. I am a nurse that works for a cardiac ambulatory practice for Lenox Hill and it gave me great pride to watch this. These docs are truly changing the lives not only of their patients but the family members of those patients who walk their journey together. I have to say that I personally cried from episode 4 to the end. I lost my mother 7 years ago to a Glioblastoma, so I felt very connected to the stories of Dr. Bookvar's patients. He passion and compassion for not only his patients but for the work he does and the research and clinical trials that he continues to push for are a testament to his dedication to his field. This is a MUST watch! You will not be disappointed!",False
21,10,Very moving and real,margadeboer,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a beautiful series, and I feel thankful for being allowed this view into the lives of the staff of this hospital.",False
22,6,"More about patients needed, less about the docs",telllaura,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's obvious from the start that the Doctors are supremely talented at Lennox Hill that care deeply about their patients medical health. However, the drawl should be about the patients- especially undergoing life and death via risky with some surgeries -almost guaranteeing a quality of life change in return.After three episodes, I have yet to see anything more than a brief next day check-in from the doctors before they head on to the next thing. What happens to these patients next, how are they holding up when returning back home? Drug addicts get no counseling and the Doctors barely look at them. What happens to the homeless that come in.Doctors aren't that fascinating often completely unaware of that the viewers can handle the diagnosis and would like to hear more about the diseases. That's interesting! The patients and their family dynamic is far more interesting than watching doctors and staff briskly th Rey Pugh halls, eating snacks and talking on the phone. Trade that for the real stories and more follow up and you have a great binge worthy series.(Typos :/ )",False
23,4,Medical reality show,Ladiloque,n/a,16/08/2025,"Couple of episodes in, this docu-medical-procedural shows what it actually is: real-tv. Which of course isn't especially truthful but just deals with the trash.Often soapy, rarely authentic, presents mildly uninteresting characters whose standings span from politically correctness to downplayed autocelebration. From stoic workaholicism to ""inspiring"" progressive views and good will to hippie/theological attitudes.
Exactly what is expected to cater to its target audience (families, mostly women, >40yo).The most interesting parts are those few in which we see these physicians not act in front of the cameras. I.e. when they explain (gild the pill? lie? an act in the non-act?) to their terminally ill patients that the surgery went ""well"" or that there's yet another new promising experimental procedure they should be trying. Or when they lose their temper, deal with the bureaucracy, the repetitive/exhausting shifts or anything truly unexpected.Unfortunately the production shows these more as an accident than as the unheroic substance of these people's lifes.Don't get tricked into thinking that since it's effortless to watch, then it's a good thing: it's like another ""Big Brother""; you feel like you're among real people... and you're actually wasting your time.",False
24,10,Real Life Greys Anatomy,linzleetpe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not as dramatic as GA but just as watchable. Gives you blunt facts straight to the face, an insightful show that leads your to understanding not only what goes behind the curtains (no pun intended) but also inside their head. You'll have a whole lot more respect for health workers after watching it, totally worth binging.",False
25,10,one of the best docuseries I ever watched,damiansofia,n/a,16/08/2025,A trully compelling docu-series and we can def admire all the doctors that participated in it. Their honesty vulnerability and incredible strength was heart-breaking and amazing to watch at the same time.I hope they will continue with a second season in the future.,False

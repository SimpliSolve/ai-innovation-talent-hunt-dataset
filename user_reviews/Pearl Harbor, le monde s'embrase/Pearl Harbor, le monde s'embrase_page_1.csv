1,7,"Corny narration, compelling images",paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary gives us a fairly light-handed treatment of its subject material: the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is completely covered in episode one, after which the second part gives us a potted treatment of the entire war in the Pacific, and some coverage of post-war events as well. And the voice-over leaves much to be desired, with its tiresome references to ""Uncle Sam"" and ""the Empire of the Rising Sun"". What it has in its favour are its images, it's amazing how much of World War Two was caught on camera, and re-touching the original footage makes it seem vivid and fresh. For those of us lucky enough never to have had to fight, it's actually pretty terrifying to watch. And for that reason alone it's worthwhile to do so.",False

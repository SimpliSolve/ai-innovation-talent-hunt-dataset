1,8,Am I the only one who wanted to see final movies,Thepunjabiviewer,n/a,16/08/2025,Anyone familiar with classic cinema would love this unscripted documentary. More then recollection of old B grade in ecknowleged film makers it did had that touch of good documentary.Story of people who once tasted success gone into oblivion and given a chance to relieve the gone by days I think it was brilliant idea.I am sure many artists would relate with the narrative and lives of these four directors.Overall it's a good watch maybe genz would not correlate but still it shows how trends can come and go. Anyways am I the only one who wanted to really see what these guys made in the end lol. I surely do.,False
2,8,Good concept and fun to watch,arpit-mishra,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you Amazon prime for making something like this. I was never a low budget film audience and judged everything created in that era. This docu-series throws light on many ignored aspects like commerce, cheesy entertainment, employment, & passion evolved in making these kind of films. It was fun to watch behind the scenes caos and struggle to make a low budget film. It was also great to see Arjun Kapoor saying ""yes"" to be part of such a concept and supporting all films industry. I think it definitely elevated the making and the production value of the project. This series successfully managed to maintain the seriousness of the topic and entertaining.",False
3,8,Fun and Surprisingly Informative,i_odin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cinema... Marte Dum Tak, as publicised, is a reincarnation of Indian Pulp. Will it be successful in reincarnating the genre in itself? I am not sure but this has surely started a conversation and personally for me turned out to be a surprisingly informative documentary. A well researched one which is also witty and entertaining.Going into the show I had very low expectations as is the case generally with other Indian documentaries. The general idea in my head was that the quality tends to be inferior when it comes to Indian Docu-series compared to the western counterparts. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this well maid. Not only it feels natural and not-forced but it also portrays the viewpoints of these four directors involved, sincerely and honestly.There is drama, comedy and yes boldness which are the necessary ingredients for an entertaining show but this show shines the brightest when it is at its rawest form. When people share their deepest insecurities and failures with camera or when they just throw a witty one liner directed towards one of the crews extemporarily, that's when this show achieves its goals for me.Speaking of the content, we all perhaps know that this world existed and what ultimately happened to it but I don't think so anyone would have tried to think about the ordeals one might had to go through to be part of this industry. This show initiates that conversation. And for that this show should be commended and celebrated.Hopefully the makers continue this job and bring more such documentaries which reveal seemingly quirky but also beautifully ordinary human stories to us.This show is a must watch.",False
4,10,"Cinema marte dum tak:-an imaginative, pulpy ride through the canopy lanes of smutty film industry",puranjanbasak,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cinema marte dum tak is a documentary series directed by vasan bala.The interior of 90s bollywood was full-on masala, so is this series. The b-grade compartment really flourished in that decade, holding the able hands of j neelam, kishan shah, dilip gulati and co. This series presents a very enjoyable and pulpy side to a docu series. This not only throws facts at you but also narrates it through a spicy lens, mostly due to the eccentric quartet of director.It talks about giving a status to the lesser known smutty side of bollywood but also recognized the problems. The public enjoyed it, it earned loads of bucks but no denying the fact that young girls who did not have an iota of what they are doing were forced in it. This is a harsh reality. There is a fine line between heroic and glorify. This series does show the quartet as heroes but never glorifies them, it celebrates them, their work but never undermine the flaws. And this is what makes it a brilliant piece of work. Hats off to vasan bala, the true lover of every kind of cinema.I rate it 10.",False
5,10,SURPRISE,ambisai,n/a,16/08/2025,"My oh myyyy.....
How do I define my experience watching this cringe worthy , quirky , totally ENTERTAINING docu series !Out of the box ...I applaud the think tanks who explored this forgotten, infamous ,titillating genre of the 90s
Mind blowing ,surreal and absolutely RAW ; IN YOUR FACE !Every line spoken by the yesteryear B grade directors hit you and thrill you.Unabashed , dark side of glamour is showcased with impunity.You just can't keep your eyes off the screen , it grips you at every level and transports you to world lessor known to a layman .Special mention for the starlets who came for the auditions !Cheers cheers cheers.",False
6,6,Remembering the legends of C-Grade Cinema in their own A-Rated manner.,SAMTHEBESTEST,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cinema Marte Dum Tak (2023) :
Series Review -Have you seen any ""C-grade"" film in your life? Why am I even asking it? Naturally, we have all seen such films in our lives at least once. I don't know where this idea came from for Cinema Marte Dum and Amazon Prime's team, but I just want to step back for a moment, think, and clap for them. Cinema Marte Dum Tak will introduce you to the faces who made those films in the late 80s and 90s and earned a cult following in some rural parts of India that are unknown to the media and other audiences. It's a hilarious docuseries. You'll have at least a couple of dozen loud gags and go gaga over the nostalgia that you now hate but once enjoyed before you started to understand quality cinema. That isn't a p*#n for sure, that's some adult stuff made with utter honesty forced by the circumstances of filmmaking: low budget, box office pressure, and personal life.Cinema Marte Dum Tak starts with a quirky song that has lusty lyrics. ""Pseudo Saiyan vodo Saiyan camera ka piche, thermocol ki vaadiyo me juice ke cheeten.. juice.. juice ke cheete."" I mean, who writes such lyrics? The next lines are even more hilarious, and I'm not going to spoil your excitement. So, the docuseries takes us to old footage from C grade cinema, which you usually laugh at as utter nonsense. Then you meet the legends behind those masterpieces: Vinod Talwar, Dilip Gulati Kishan Shah, and J. Neelam. They start narrating their struggle, mindset, and efforts behind making those films, and you start believing every word they say because it's so 'humanly true'. The four directors are given a chance to make their last film, and they are delighted. The films' names are ""Shanti Basera,"" ""Blood Suckers,"" ""Sauten Bani Chudail,"" and ""Jungle Girl"". Yes, you are supposed to laugh, and please don't feel awkward because those four are open hearted and too bindass to tolerate your shyness.Created by maverick filmmaker Vasan Bala (who recently delivered a fantastic murder mystery called ""Monica Oh My Darling), the six-episode reality docuseries is a first-ever peek into the dazzling and independent ecosystem of the 90s B and C grade pulp cinema industry. Co-directed by Disha Rindani, Xulfee and Kulish Kant Thakur, Cinema Marte Dum also features interviews of Raza Murad, Mukesh Rishi, Harish Patel, Pahlaj Nihlani, Kanti Shah and Rakhi Sawant, amongst others, who share insights on this lesser-known chapter of Indian cinema. The young Bollywood actor Arjun Kapoor also makes an appearance as a host in the final episode, where he makes those four directors speak their hearts out and share some emotional segments.Luckily, I saw the first two episodes in a packed theatre with the cast and media-a group that understands cinema. I had a riot, to say the least. Claps, hoots, painful cheeks and stomach, and tears in eyes out of loud laughter. That's how I reached home and then saw the rest of the episode. The next two episodes also had me bursting into laughter. It's so much fun-chaotic fun, outright blasting fun fest-oh my my, how can I explain it. Then, the last two episodes. (4th and 5th) are sucked out of comedy as the Dracula/Vampire from ""Blood Suckers"" has sucked all the fun instead of blood. The 4th and 5th episodes are more dramatic and emotional-sort of debatable too-but that's what you owe them (the directors). All those rape scenes, ugly and obscene faces from low-budget horror flicks, juicy bikini scenes, bed scenes, bath scenes, and cheap dialogues from old B and C-grade films are there to make you giggle, but with a ""bits"" of extra (portion) nostalgia. ""Haath me leke khada kar, chote ko bada kar."" You'll also get adult entertainment as such.Cinema Marte Dum Tak is a unique concept for a documentary genre, and it's unfiltered, unrated, and uncut, which makes it more hard hitting and real. You have to have some knowledge of that kind of cinema and the media headlines surrounding it to connect deeply with the narrative. But the main essence of Cinema Marte Dum Tak is paying homage to the people who were lost in the midst of stardom, PR, and front page material. The movies were dumb, but the directors weren't. They just had a specific mindset to make those films for a certain section of audience in certain districts of India that are far away from our modernization and urbanisation. Cinema Marte Dum Tak gives them a platform to speak up and open our eyes about whatever image we had created of them. As a whole, it puts you on a map of cinema to show the right path about where we were and where we are headed. Cinema is a medium for people, and people aren't bound to one category. Today we have multiplexes and Hollywood films doing higher business than our own domestic films, but there's a section of the audience who still want to watch the steamy stuff online. Back then, there was no internet, no memes, no Facebook, no tik-tok, and no Instagram reels, so they had to fulfil their thirst with these so-called ""B"" and ""C"" grade films. Prime Video has more subscribers in urban centres, but I hope Cinema Marte Dum Tak reaches those people who used to watch these low grade films in theatres and that their legends, ie. The four directors, get enough recognition for the work they have done. Let them meet their Rajkumar Hirani, Neeraj Pandey, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, SS Rajamouli, Aishwarya Rai, and Sridevi.RATING - 6/10*",False
7,10,A must watch to understand the cinema of the 90s and the people behind,Kornephoros,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a beautifully crafted series and kudos to all the directors and the actors. Their straight from the heart talk kept me glued in throughout.Most of us born in the 70s and 80s may have heard of or seen some of the movies, but to take a look at the people behind these was something else.At some moments it made me emotional too to see and feel their pain. Very happy that Amazon thought of such a series and executed it flawlessly.All of the directors and actors have a human angle behind the mask and the layers were peeled beautifully. The series did a great job of not just giving them the perfect platform but also making some of their wishes come true.",False
8,7,The pulp Indian cinema is back!,cseabhi,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was not a big fan of 90's B or C grade movie but those films were certainly fun to watch. Especially for their witty and hilariously illogical dialogue.The series which is created by Vasan Bala is about those B or C grade movies and their producers directors. The series revolves around life of four such directors - J Neelam, Vinod Talwar, Dilip Gulati and Kishan Shah. They are asked by the creators to return to film making after two decades and make four B grade movies, the type of movies they were making in the 90's.This documentary-styled series is based on that only - it gives a peek into the lives of those directors and how they are living their life, which is not very luxorious. They are delighted as the creators of the series gave them a chance to make a movie.The series shows us how they make movie with such low budgets and what are their struggle and with all these happenings, the directors discuss the business and politics that were affecting this kind of cinema industry back in those days.I personally feel this is a good series which is based on reality and the lifes of four directors who were in their prime once but now living a low life. People who used to love those type of pulp indian cinemas would certainly love this series.Even people who have interest in movies and how the movies are made, the ecosystem of movies, would also love this docu series.",False
9,10,Worth a watch.,amritanshsingh,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are a fan of 80s- 90s B, C grade films then you should definitely check it out. An honest attempt to show you the real life struggles of those film makers.Not all Film makers lead a life of glitz and glamour in Bollywood, some are still struggling to make ends meet.Just one little question, they made 4 separate movies in this series but I don't know where to watch it. If anyone has seen those movies then please let me know also, and yes movie ka koi A,B,C grade nahi hota, cinema to cinema hoti hai,chahe bade budget ki ho ya chhote budget ki. And I wish ki ab phir se in category ki movies ko banne ka mauka mile.",False
10,7,A guilty pleasure watch to know some unknown facets of C grade movies,wonderwellwisher,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have heard some good reviews about it, and for the genre it falls under, I definitely wanted to give it a try. Being a 90s kid, I was familiar with the era they spoke about, so I caught the train, even if fashionably late.This documentary series explores an era of C-grade movies, where big screens were filled with raunchy films, and theaters were packed with daily wage workers or frustrated males. The series focuses on the lives of yesteryear directors J. Neelam, Vinod Talwar, Dilip Gulati, and Kishan Shah, and includes a truckload of actors, distributors, technicians, and other directors who shed light on that era.Of course, it was a guilty pleasure to watch, as it rightly showcased how and why these movies were made. You'll be fully invested in the series, as many things revealed were eye-opening for me as well. You can criticize why they made such movies, but when there's demand, they supply-simple as that. Also, no one was forced to act in or watch these films. Lakhs of people survived on this business.The whole sequence of directors making movies was fun to watch. It was astonishing to see how, with such low budgets and short timelines, they were able to churn out films. Being in the industry, the scenes on set, from ""action"" to ""cut,"" were always tingling moments, and this series let me relive those experiences.The final episode, featuring Arjun Kapoor and the roundtable discussion, was a great idea, but it felt funny to see where Arjun fits in with these filmmakers, and where he should have been in movies. The whole red-carpet experience for these directors and their families was an emotional moment, and you could feel their lifelong craving for recognition. Don't miss the title track-it's a fun number to listen to.For all the movie buffs out there, this is definitely a fun watch. It's not something solid to munch on, but it's an entertaining time-pass series.#pranureviews #CinemaMarteDumTak #CinemaMarteDumTakReview.",False
11,9,B and C filmmaking,t4art,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the past, I watched a bunch of bad movies on VHS, but they were fun to pass the timee
I didn't know who were behind these films, but they were available
And after watching this series, I got to know this worldAn interesting documentary that highlights B and C filmmaking
There are stories, stations, situations and circumstances that are the reasons for the emergence of this type of film
We got to know the filmmakers of this kindThe director was able to bring us the world of second- and third-rate films with his creative style that we expected from him, as he is fully aware of his toolsThe series is interesting and touching, well worth watching.I like it.",False
12,6,".. curate our shadies, our ghettos, our campies, our pulpies, and our own prosthetic awesomeness",smkbsws,n/a,16/08/2025,"I liked how they made this docu-homage with the not-so-top-tier directors of the not-so-top-tier film genres. I mean, after watching Ed Wood/Dolomite Is My Name/The Disaster Artist/the vulgar auteur wave, I had been thinking that India/Bollywood might be the rightmost place to find and curate our shadies, our ghettos, our campies, our pulpies, and our own prosthetic awesomeness. I was mainly looking after the Ramsay Brothers' legacy. Frankly speaking, I did not knew any of the directors they featured. I just knew couple of the movie titles from some quiz thing I guess. But now I am proud to know them. I am excited to know that there was another version of ""Deewaar"" between Kanti Shah and his not-so-career-oriented brother. Now I can share the story of how a wannabe actress turned to be a director exploitation categories. And about the other two old directors - that's called charm and aura.The documentary had a few flaws, and repetitiveness is a major one. And I was expecting some bits and bites from Ramsays after they celebrated the late entry of the great Kanti :)",False
13,5,Little bit Stretched!,nitishkumarmohanta,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such an unique documentary which represents the detailed journey from Directors to the Actors of B and C Grade movie industry (in their professional career as well as personal life) during 1980s and 90s. I will say they covered all the aspects of 80s and 90s pretty well but the screenplay remains so slow and dull. They could have gone for little bit short episodes and make it appealing for today's generation, but they only thought about 40/50 age peoples which make this series underrated.This series have lots of sensual elements and explicit language so definitely not recommend for the family audiences ; and I'll go with 5 out of 10 stars for it.",False

1,9,Beautiful look into a team with sky-high dreams,ajae-54401,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a stunning portrait of a team of talented kids at a college not known for academics. It's there last chance at the NBA dream. It screams authenticity and is a beautiful look into the minds of these players.Highly recommend to any fans of sports or basketball. It makes you feel what they feel. The pressure. The excitement. The anger. All of it.,False
2,8,Authentic,EricTucker24,n/a,16/08/2025,"I grew up around people who aspired to play professionally. I only know one person that made it. This series gives insight on the obstacles these athletes juggle in their everyday lives. I love seeing them turn their lives around and overcome injustices, bad decisions and a system that has failed them. This in depth series gives a beautiful depiction of the highs and lows these young athletes go through. Most people do not see the everyday struggle of an athlete. Last Chance U will keep you glued and invested in each player and coach. No matter your background you can gain some gems watching this series.",False
3,9,Has me caring for basketball on a deeper level,jonasvagnkarstensen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a fan of basketball, or any sport for that matter, but this show is much more than just basketball. The insight into the coaches' and players' lives creates a connection that then has me actually caring how well they do in their games, despite me not caring much for sports really. End of episode 7 and beginning of episode 8 was very intense, I was cheering for them with all my heart.Great documentary.",False

Follow this journey and reminisce about the days your boys on the team were as close as the team you were born into...Family. You won't find a sports documentary that draws you in and takes you through this rollercoaster of emotion and triumph all the way to a climax that ends with a moment in recent history that changed the the world as much as 9/11 did 20 years ago. Pulling for the young men of ELAC and the coaches of this documentary...I'm invested emotionally in your future success. Thank you all for letting us in...Family on 3, 1-2-3...",False
5,10,An absolute joy for any basketball fan out there.,santiagomarshallm,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series is both heartbreaking, inspiring and homie. Any basketball fan will love it.",False
6,10,Incredible,avanderlaan-47206,n/a,16/08/2025,"So well put together. This team, those coaches, this documentary, just incredible. 10/10. One of the best series I have ever watched",False
7,n/a,Soooo good,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI think was my favourite in the series. The coach is so invested in his kids that it draws you in and really makes you hope these guys make it in whatever capacity that is. Loved the series but the ending is absolutely heartbreaking..... this is just one sport story of millions during COVID but the reality and seeing it on their faces was devastating.
Prayers up for the future of this program and it's coaches.
Love the series and hope it comes back.
Brilliant documentary",True
8,10,Gripping basketball documentary,puiu,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is so beautifully done, it had me glued to the screen. Conflict, comedy, drama it has it all and if you're also a basketball fan or player, you know it's hitting all the right spots.",False
9,10,Coach,kevin_oconnell76,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like football more than basketball, however, I like this series better. Coach M. Is a legit man and gets me fired up about my own life. He loves you guys more than you'll ever know. Don't ever forget this man.",False
10,10,Return to the Magic Formula of LCU I,shone-diggity,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love LCU football series but the last season was a snoozefest. This brings back the magic: incredible young men with problems stacked against them, some by the own doing, but you are rooting for them all the way in life more importantly; basketball is just the backdrop. these young men and coaches and their loved ones supporting them - they arent just in LA but in everyones backyard just go to your local Juco games amd ahow support. see it first hand. show em love",False
11,7,"Less conflict, more compassion",harrylosborne,n/a,16/08/2025,"As the team learns that their season's worth of work has been for naught, there is a heavy sense of foreboding. Last Chance U's first season in basketball carries with it the weight of a year suspended - players having their ambitions and dreams curtailed by an opposition they didn't even get to face. The stakes feel slightly lower compared to the show's footballing equivalent, but the sense of community is far more resonant.Most central to these shows is not the players, but the coach at the heart. Coach Mosley is the motor, a god-fearing man converted from a potentially deadly way of life to a path of helping others better themselves. Alongside his equally devoted assistants, they power this high-quality team through game after game, showing the benefit that role models can impart on teenagers from difficult backgrounds.The quality of athlete here is higher than in any of the Last Chance U seasons before, creating some real sporting spectacles. No doubt a couple are looking at going pro in a few years, and this drive makes watching their dreams curtailed by COVID-19 even tougher to accept. They are not all from broken homes and tough lives (as is so often the narrative with this Netflix show) - rather, they are taking their final punts at continuing the sport they love.This shift of narrative is a double-edged sword: the all too real drama of people balancing sport and survival was a great watch, but it wasn't in the best interests of the people involved. This season is a more uplifting angle, looking more at building better people than better athletes.",False
12,10,"Fresh, Modern Direction with Brilliant character development and story telling",aatir-99111,n/a,16/08/2025,"So I'm currently on episode 7 right now (which is the second last episode) and I had to write this review before the last episode so as to not let potential heartbreak, that may await me, bias my review. This is absolutely hands down one of the BEST sports documentaries I've ever seen, and that's throwing in some heavy weights like Iverson, More than a game, and Senna.The direction of the documentary is Brilliant. I've realized after reading some reviews that the Last Chance U series has quite a following but I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the direction was. The series overall feels fresh with the right flavour of Hip -Hop mixed into it. As someone who loves basketball, played through HS and is part of the community, you know what the vibes on gameday were like growing up, when you blasted the latest hip-hop single, got your Jordans, Kobe's or Lebron's out, laced up, and went out to put shots feeling the weight of the world watching you but also the thrill of going into battle.The coaches are what you hear about and see in stories and legends, and you really see the humanity, the struggle and the passion they have for the game. The players are what really take home the cake, of course. Their stories are riveting and bone numbing, with a lot of them having faced some of the toughest challenges middle and lower class kids are subjected too in todays day and age. Some of them have gone through mind numbing ordeals and trials, and how they come through and let their personality flourish through the guidance of the coaches and their love for the game is what pulls you in as each episode ends and you go deeper into the rabbit hole.Overall, its a must watch if you're a person who loves sports, especially basketball. You start to get invested and wanting them to succeed, and you realize going through that the most important thing the documentary shows you a different perspective of everyday kids on their journey through life, growing and molding themselves, which can be summarized by 2 words: Hoop Dreams.",False
13,6,Not near as good as the football series,bilp998,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kind of boring because there wasn't enough basketball action, should of been alott more. Didn't warm to as many of the players as I did for the football series. The head coach was great, the star of the season.",False
14,5,Nothing New Here,dansview,n/a,16/08/2025,"Come on! I've watched a few episodes and still have not seen one moment in the classroom. It's like their profession is being a JUCO basketball player. There is no reference to them even being students.Like I said in my review of the first football season of this series, why do they even need to attend college, if their only goal is to go pro? Just create a minor league.Meanwhile their college is in an extremely Asian city, (Monterey Park), where everyone who is not Asian is Hispanic, yet these guys are neither.We don't see any signs of that from crowd scenes. Because there is no coverage of cheerleaders or crowds. Or at least not so far. The culture clash would create an interesting angle. Viewers don't even realize who lives in that part of East L. A.Another profile of shallow 20 year-olds who think they are God's gift to the world, but in reality are not even that good. Plus a coach with a Master's Degree who talks like he just stepped out of the hood. I don't buy that.Although at least he's not playing to the camera the way other coaches did in previous seasons.Let me see players recruited to a JUCO in Vermont or Montana, instead of the South or California. The Kansas football version was interesting.When they play other teams, we see that everyone has a big man, and various talented players. Not just our profiled team. It's a fiercely competitive world. Even for pastry chefs.I'd like to see a John Wooden type of coach some time. One who stressed fundamentals. Not dunks.",False
15,10,Better than the football ones,karimelrachidi,n/a,16/08/2025,"This ones fire, take you into depth with the team love it",False
16,9,Brilliant,liammcgibbon,n/a,16/08/2025,Last chance U has always been good . It's goes in-depth . Learn more about the sport . They go into detail of the coach and players personally and then it's a rollercoaster of a documentary,False
17,9,The real struggle,arabnikita,n/a,16/08/2025,"Last Chance U: Basketball (2021)This is a documentary series that you most likely skipped right through on Netflix without giving it a second thought. However, if you take a moment and watch at least the first episode, you will see how much heart, passion and dedication are put into every chapter of this gritty tale. If you are a fan of sports, you were one day dreaming of becoming a professional athlete; at least I was. I knew it was a long a painful journey but I never imagined that on top of skill and commitment, so much can be determined by a simple chance.Normally, most of the professional basketball players aspire to end up in the NBA. They train hard while playing in school and if they manage to make it to a university, they quadruple that intensity as only a handful make it to the top. This is what an ideal journey looks like but there are those who aren't lucky enough to have this smooth experience. Whether because of personal issues, injuries or sheer bad luck a number of players find themselves in community colleges where intensity must be multiplied tenfold.This documentary deals with a team playing for East Los Angeles Community College. Each player has made a certain mistake in their lives and now they are trying to climb out of that inescapable void to achieve their dream. It is a documentary that hits your hard because it deals with real people and real struggles. Filmed in a highly professional fashion, it has the right balance of heart pounding basketball content and heartbreaking human emotions to keep you attached until the final moment. There are a bunch of fantastic players but the greatest highlight for me was Coach Moalsey who personifies inspiration with every word he says.If you are a fan of sports, any kind of sports, and if you ever dreamed of making it big, you will see what it really takes to scratch that dream. If you aren't a sports fan, you will see that these athletes do a lot more that dribble basketballs.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",False
18,8,Inspiring,dcjones-36601,n/a,16/08/2025,"What I like about this season versus the football seasons is that this coach isn't a prick nor is he looking for his 15 seconds of fame. He's solely about the players and it's evident from the get go. When he does act out, which is seldom, he does so in an adult manner with intent to educate versus curse and launch into the ""glory days"" speeches of how they were all that. This coach is passionate about his family and enjoys lifting his student athletes up however he can. Similar to the football series, this version does a great job of providing an in depth look at some of the teams' top talent and their journey thus far to help you feel for them.
Overall, Last Chance U is headed in the right direction so looking forward to the next season.",False
19,10,It's a beautiful insight in what passion is really about,mntalindjai,n/a,16/08/2025,I just wanted to congratulate to everyone from the directors to the players and the amazing coach I wish joy and prosperity to all of them and hope one day they dreams become higher than what they desired. Amazing documentary everyone should hop on and watch and learn from it. Not everyone has rich parents and your way is already scripted these team crafted their way in. I'm lost for words. Last chance U we need another série ASAP,False
20,9,Could not disagree more with the guy who gave this a 1...,briandfinley,n/a,16/08/2025,"I tend be skeptical of documentary series like this because it's so easy for the filmmakers to manipulate the narrative and the audience's willing suspension of disbelief. Especially in a sports environment, which already has the built-in drama regarding winning and losing.However, I got completely sucked in almost immediately. This is a very well-crafted examination of an intensely dramatic scenario, with vivid & sympathetic characters who are very clearly defined by their individual circumstances, their personalities, and the depth of their need to succeed. For the young basketball players, the pressure to meet the moment and prevail is a constant theme in their lives, which us older adults can see as agonizingly fraught with peril. IT's a bit like watching a slasher film: ""don't go down there! Aggghhh!"". You want these kids, who have been given so little in life to see how their daily choices can reverberate across decades. You there, stifle that impulsivity, and do as I say! It is a nerve-wracking and poignant watch.The head coach is equally fascinating: a deeply devout Christian whose coaching chops would easily translate to Division 1 or 2 college basketball, but chooses to work with kids in East Los Angeles who are struggling to get scholarships to those types of schools. His faith in his players and fervor for guiding them while also constantly tearing them down is a major source of drama. You watch this guy and one minute you're ""what a great guy!"" and then ""what an a*****e!"".And then there are the basketball games, played by real athletes on real teams, some of whom are very talented. The BIG problem with sports movies, is that no matter how hard they try, actors just can't simulate high-level athleticism. The greatest sports movies (not including documentaries) all fail BADLY at presenting athletic performance. These kids can ball.",False
21,6,Headache from the Coach screaming & abusing players,scole-87038,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series is fine, but the coach is a major tool. He loves playing to the camera & seems to think the more he can yell & scream and offer meaningless nonsensical sayings, the more intelligent he sounds. Surely the college administration must be embarrassed by this guy. & does he think he'll ever be hired at any other school after they see how he treats people?To top it off, he forces the players to listen to jesus stuff & to loudly proclaim 'amen' at the end. I know Americans love religion , but this way over the top. And why exactly does someone who apparently sings religious songs with his children in the car. ( lol ) think it's fine to treat students terribly by screaming, abusing, & demeaning them?",False
22,9,Pulls you in,bartkow,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not interested in basketball whatsoever. It just has never been a sport I've enjoyed watching. So I expected that this version wouldn't grab me the same as the football series previous. But the storylines and personal stories grabbed me all the same. I enjoyed the differences in the personalities of the coaching staff. Coach John Mosley is interesting. He has the intensity of some of the notorious coaches of the football series, but has his unique ways of expressing himself. As with Cheer and previous Last Chance U seasons, Greg Whiteley does a good job of showing the struggles of youth in transition.",False
23,6,Old man yells at young team,HARRISONALLCAPS,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerS2 is beyond ridiculous, I feel bad for the young talented men under this coach just being screamed at. Mosley goes through a car accident and still does not learn any humility or compassion. Painful to watch and stopped at ep 3.Cannot believe what netflix will fund for views. No doubt this experience would have ended a lot of love and enjoyment for a beautiful sport.S2 is beyond ridiculous, I feel bad for the young talented men under this coach just being screamed at.

24,1,"Terrible, just terrible.",da_gillespie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Might be the only truthful review on here so far. I'm a huge fan of the football series and have been excited for this season. Been binging and let me tell y'all... probably the most boring thing I've watched. The HC is alright but the players have no energy and the games are not interesting. The first episode was making me sleepy... this is garbage. I want to like it, and I'm glad the players aren't in ""life or death"" scenarios but all of them talk about ""I don't have to do this, I've got other stuff""... they don't care and it shows. This was an absolute bust and black eye for the series. Bring back football or switch to a new school, because it's borderline painful to watch something so hyped up fail. Watch Cheer or re-watch East Miss, don't watch this.",False
25,9,You Don't Have to be a Basketball Fan to Love This Series!,briangeorgi,n/a,16/08/2025,"I find that the better documentaries are driven by character, suspense, or history. This has all three in spades! Whether or not you care about - or even know about - JUCO basketball(I didn't), you'll be caught up in this story from the first episode. It's the best I've seen in '21 and I would dare anyone watching not find yourself rooting for this flawed but lovable team and their equally flawed but inspiring coach.",False

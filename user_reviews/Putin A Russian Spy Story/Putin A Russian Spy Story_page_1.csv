1,8,The rise of another superpower dictatorship,clanciai,n/a,16/08/2025,"Putin came from the slums of Leningrad where he from the start made himself prominent as a thug among street gang fighters. Gradually he advanced into politics, where the KGB took care of him and educated him into a a cool ruthless opportunist using any means to further his career. As such he got into the favours of the decaying alcoholised Boris Yeltsin, who made him his successor for the presidency of Russia. This position he has maintained by consistently persecuting opponents and critics, even abroad, like the notorious Litvinenko case in Britain, a British citizen murdered by Putin's agents. This was followed by other political murders of truth-sayers, the most prominent being the journalist Anna Politkovskaya in Moscow, assassinated at home on Putin's birthday, like a demonstration of Putin's power. He has also been accused of bringing Donald Trump to power in America, but like all allegations of his crimes, Putin has denied them all, being safe in his absolute position and having made sure to obliterate any possible evidence. What we are dealing with here is a world mafia syndicate of the richest people in the world in the highest positions of power, like Putin, Trump, Bolsonaro, Erdogan, the Iran jihad autocracy, the Chinese communist party, Kim Jong Un and others. This documentary gives a comprehensive view and insight into Putin's career, pointing out the fact that he is nothing but a street gangster thug that as a professional opportunist has managed to replace a former regime of ruthless gangsters with another more subtle gangster syndicate with himself as supreme mafia boss.",False

3,8,The Untold Story!,Lecinaste,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis three-part documentary series tells the story of Vladimir Putin's rise from a Soviet intelligence officer (KGB) to one of the most powerful leaders in modern history. Directed by Nick Green, the documentary explores how Putin's experiences in the intelligence service shaped his worldview and leadership style, deeply influencing not only Russia but also the international stage.The series is rich in interviews with former colleagues, political analysts, and journalists who offer an in-depth look into Putin's early life, his career in the KGB, and his calculated ascent to power. One of the film's key points is how Putin leveraged his intelligence background, using strategies of manipulation, control, and secrecy to solidify his grip on Russian politics.What sets this documentary apart is its portrayal of Putin as a skilled player in political dynamics, using a combination of nationalism, fear, and calculated force to consolidate his power. The documentary also touches on critical moments in his career, such as his management of the Chechen wars, his relationship with oligarchs, and his attempts to restore Russia's prominence on the global stage. It shows how, under his leadership, Russia transitioned from a fledgling democracy into an authoritarian regime.The film largely adopts a critical tone, focusing on the darker aspects of Putin's rule, such as the suppression of free speech, media control, and allegations of election manipulation. It portrays a leader whose survival instincts, honed during his intelligence days, have made him both feared and admired.Visually, the documentary combines archival footage, news clips, and interviews, giving viewers a comprehensive look at Putin's journey. However, some viewers may feel that the documentary lacks balance, as it tends to emphasize Putin's authoritarianism over other aspects of his governance.An intriguing point covered in the documentary is the impact of a particular film on Vladimir Putin's decision to join the KGB. In his youth, Putin was deeply influenced by the Soviet film ""The Shield and the Sword"" (1968), which tells the story of a Soviet intelligence officer posing as a Nazi spy during World War II. The film highlights the challenges and risks faced by the officer in serving his country.In conclusion, this documentary offers a gripping, though dark, portrait of one of the most controversial figures of our time. It clearly shows how his background as a spy has continued to shape his leadership and influence global geopolitics. This documentary is essential viewing for anyone interested in understanding the complexities behind Putin's iron-fisted rule and its impact on modern Russia.The documentary provides a blend of political analysis and historical context, making it ideal for viewers who want to learn more about Russia's political landscape under Putin.",True
4,9,Better than expected,Anti-Fascist,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am very familiar with the modern history of Russia, and this miniseries didn't really bring anything new to the table for me. But it summarized pretty nicely the Putin's presidency, and I was in fact positively surprised.However, certain major events were totally omitted from the series, such as the war in Georgia in 2008, the Sochi doping scandal, the Moscow theatre hostage crisis of 2002, the Beslan school siege of 2004, and the earlier constitution change in 2012 that prolonged the presidential terms from 4 years to 6 years.And more effort could've been put on investigating the financial arrangements between Putin and his oligarch friends, and how they have been investing their wealth in the UK and elsewhere in the west...Anyway, any movie or series that is critical of Putin earns a pretty high score by default. The world needs much more productions like this.",False
5,10,Scum Dictator Admired by Scum Trump*,leftbanker-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Vladimir Putin is nothing less than a fascist dictator and the idol of Trump who would have loved nothing more than to have the freedom to murder political opponents and journalists reporting the truth about him. America avoided a fascist coup by the simple fact that Trump is a complete moron and unable to think beyond a single move on the checker board while Putin can play chess at a junior level.*If you think that calling an ex-U. S. President ""scum"" is disrespectful, I would have agreed with you...right up until Scum Trump denied Biden's victory in the 2020 election and then urged his moronic followers to storm the Capitol in what he hoped would be a fascist coup d'Ã©tat. Trump deserves no respect.",False

7,5,Decent Putin primer,ecopolst,n/a,16/08/2025,Putin: A Russian Spy Story is a decent documentary on Vladimir Putin's political life from about 1995 to 2018.Two hours of watching this three episode documentary gives the viewer a chance to follow Putin's reasonably well documented rise to power and what he does with that power. A clear UK focus shines through as events affecting UK get more attention than objectively deserved. This also leads to a few Russian opposition figures getting more coverage than natural in a documentary on Putin.There are many interviews with friends and foes of Putin. A fair amount of old pictures and interviews of Putin himself have been dug up. There is also a tiny bit of analysis from independent Russia expertsThe documentary is still not dated as of 2021. Despite the odd flaw it gives the insight into Vladimir Putin and his political ideas and abilities needed for the common person somewhat into poliitcs. Putin: A Russian Spy Story is an OK way to spend two hours if you are interested in modern Russia and don't know the details about Vladimir Putin.,False

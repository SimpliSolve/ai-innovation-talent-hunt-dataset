1,9,An Excellent Chronicle of a Remarkable Woman,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Living up to one's potential is indeed inspiring, especially for those who successfully overcome tremendous challenges in doing so. Such was the case of Katharine ""Kay"" Graham (1917-2001), publisher of The Washington Post newspaper and CEO of the multimedia Washington Post Co. Organization, the subject of this insightful new documentary from directors George and Teddy Kunhardt. Having been unexpectedly thrust into this demanding management role after the tragic suicide of her husband Philip in 1963, Graham nevertheless assumed the reins of this position with the intent of keeping the Post as the respected family business that it had been since her father acquired it in 1933. Yet, even though Graham had some experience working for the paper and had always taken an interest in its quality and well-being, she nevertheless knew little about running a business. This was a task made all the more daunting simply by virtue of being a woman in what was at that time clearly seen as a man's domain. Over the years, however, she learned much, becoming a role model for women in the business world, despite not seeing herself as a diehard feminist. What's more, during this time, Graham confidently presided over the ample challenges posed by publishing the Pentagon Papers and breaking the story about the Watergate scandal, incidents that changed the nation's political landscape and put fundamental First Amendment rights to the test. Viewers thus witness Graham's evolution in becoming a respected and successful business leader, despite everything that could have worked against her. In telling this story, the filmmakers draw upon a wealth of historically significant archive footage, including damning excerpts from the secret White House recordings from the Nixon presidency, as well as recent interviews with friends, family members and colleagues who knew and worked with her, such as journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, women's rights activist Gloria Steinem, and close friend and mentor Warren Buffett. And, of course, there are numerous clips with Graham herself, candidly and succinctly revealing her perspectives on what she experienced and what we must collectively do when faced with the kinds of challenges that she and the Post had to contend with. At a time when the roles and rights of women are being threatened and the credibility and reliability of the press has come under increasing (and, some would say, justifiable) scrutiny, ""Becoming Katharine Graham"" serves as a powerful reminder of the hard-won nature of these fundamental protections and the need to fight for their preservation. We as a society should be grateful for individuals like Kay Graham for doing so much in bringing them into being. This film is an excellent chronicle of those efforts and a potent cautionary tale about what we might stand to lose if we let our diligence lapse.",False
2,7,Kay Graham done justice,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Becoming Katherine Graham"" (2025 release; 92 min) opens, it is ""October 1, 1975"" and the Washington Post is in turmoil resulting from a union strike. Katherine Graham wonders which side she really wants to support. We then go back in time to her upbringing in circles of privilege. Her dad had purchased the Washington Post in 1933, and the paper eventually up with Phil Graham, Katherine's husband. When Phil dies tragically in 1963, Katherine is suddenly put in the spotlight as the new CEP in an industry not particularly women-friendly. At this point we are 10 minutes int the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from co-directors Teddy Kunhardt and George Kunhardt (""John McCain: For Whom the Bells Toll""). Here they look back at the life and times of Kay Graham, a true pioneer who who help life the sleepy Washington Post to great heights, culminating of course with the Watergate scandal it exposed from start to finish. The documentary benefits from the fact that mostly we hear from Graham herself (when asked who or what she was before and after becoming CEO at the WaPo, she responds (without any irony) ""Doormat wife, working woman"". One of the most striking visuals is the now infamous picture of Graham with her Board of Directors, of course all male, all white. The other thing that is remarkable is the extensive use of the Nixon White House secret tapes, where we hear Nixon use language that is eerily similar to the current POTUS musings. In that sense, the documentary is very timely indeed to remind us how a runaway president bent on ruling the country by hook or by crook endangers our democracy. We all know how the Nixon presidency ended. Will history be any different this time? Meanwhile, enjoy this documentary's excellent tribute to a true pioneer that was Kay Graham.""Becoming Katherine Graham"" was released some months ago and is now playing on Amazon Prime, where I caught it the other night. If you are interested in the role of newspapers and journalists in our democracy, or simply curious how an inexperienced woman took over the Washington Post, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False

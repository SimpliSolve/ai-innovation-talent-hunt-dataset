1,10,"You are paving the way. Keep true and be you. Thank you for sharing your authentic Self, we love you.",itsbrycejewell,n/a,16/08/2025,"So many great people you talk about did make the world a better place, you have and will continue to. So much progress has been made to create this space for all of us to live our authentic lives right now and you are the peak of it. Please continue to do us proud and be proud. We are proud of you. The haters won't change anything, love transcends. Authenticity shines through. From a Gay 20 year old in Atlanta that works in the entertainment industry...I can't express to you how important you are for so many. Keep it up brother, the universe and nature knows the truth. Crew, Stage Crew, Cast all of you, you're doing more than you know for so many young men and old men too. I was watching Queen Bees the other day and one of the actresses talked about being at the MLK March in Washington, talking about how they were trying to change the world and she laughed. I wanted to reach through the screen and tell them they did it. You have and will too in your own way. The March is just a lil bit different.",False
2,8,Where do we go now?,tomassalazartrivino,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is beautiful. Just another reason to love him more. As a big Lil Nas' fan, I have always known he's a vulnerable person as I've read it online. But this showcases his true self without fear, making us feel like we know him and reminding us that he's just another human, as vulnerable as we are. I'm a latin american fan so I didn't get to be on this tour, but I saw him live @ Lolla CL 23. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had and I just know the people that attended this tour won't ever have an experience as great as this unless it is another LNX concert.I just can't thank you enough LNX, for showing your true self and making all of your fans believe in themselves. I hope I meet you someday!",False

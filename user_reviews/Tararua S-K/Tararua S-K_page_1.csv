1,9,Excellent Film,divinepcampbell,n/a,15/08/2025,"A stunning record of a very exciting run. The film was a great draw card for attendance at our tramping club meeting and we were pleased with the number who attended. Lots of highlights including: impressive filming and editing, stunning photography, great camaraderie and support between participants, interesting interviews with Dave Capper, Gary Goldsworty and Sir Graeme Dingle - and a a real sense of just how epic and very hard it is to run 80km over difficult terrain in such a short time. Loved the whoops of delight at the Kaitoke road end. Lots of questions afterwards - a good sign the audience was invigorated by it all. And sensed a ""stirring of blood"" in the room - comments from the older members who perhaps were feeling sentimental about their Tararua S-K experiences (albeit slower than minus 24 hours) and strong interest from the younger ones now wanting to give it a go. All the very best for the success of the film.",False
2,10,Epic adventure film,tomcharles-27215,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is a fantastic account of both the beauty and the beast that is New Zealand's Tararua main range, specifically, the S-K route.It takes determination, planning, and perhaps a few loose screws to attempt the S-K, but the chance to win an imaginary space in the dusty carpark of glory keeps drawing people into the Tararuas to attempt something awesome.By watching this film be prepared to be inspired to attempt something out of the ordinary, that perhaps scaes you, that pushes you to, or even beyond your limits.Andy Curruthers does a great job of combining the very real and important sense of community that surrounds the S-K, with some of the rich history, the legends, the records, the mystique and the dangers the range possesses. Andy takes you along on his journey to attempt to complete the S-K after 2 previous failed attempts.The S-K film is a great reminder that life is full of epic adventures just waiting to be had, some are even potentially on your doorstep if you just open your eyes to seek it out. What's your next adventure!?",False
3,10,Impressive film,annkendon,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is impressive in it's ability to capture the beauty and character of the Tararua's and the community of people who enjoy adventuring there.The Tararua's are our local mountains, just a 90 min drive away. Being familiar with the S-K challenge and it's various versions over the years, but not having ever done it myself, it was a treat to see this film on the big screen. I loved the fusion of storytelling, people and very familiar scenery that Andy Carruther's has woven into this film.Inspiring? Absolutely. This film maker is not only documenting the gruelling S-K challenge, but is out there doing it.",False
4,10,A delight,sergiovandam-53668,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love spending time in the mountains, and this story captured the spirit of the Tararua range and those who spend time in it splendidly. It did not pretend that this place is for everyone - it is simply special to certain type of people.There was no ego in the story, just the capture of a place and a particular group of people who push themselves to the limit there.It might have been even better if some of the pain of people pulling out and / or suffering had been added to the mix, because it is brutal.For me personally, it simply made me want to spend more time in the great outdoors and the Tararuas specifically. Well done to the team!",False
5,10,Both inspiring and awe-inspiring,joshua_bowman,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow! What a tremendous account of this rugged, adventurous route. Well presented from beginning to end, this film will no doubt inspire countless others to attempt both this and other adventures here in New Zealand and abroad.I thoroughly enjoyed the way this story was told to include both past and present stories through modern footage and historical accounts from the pioneers of this wild journey. This film is visually stunning and awe-inspiring, and is a great reminder of just how beautifully dramatic the NZ landscape can be. The obvious physical challenge of this route is extremely impressive as well. This has inspired me to get back out there and get amongst it! It will no doubt have this effect on many who watch it.",False
6,10,Perfect kiwi endurance adventure doco,john-26944,n/a,15/08/2025,"Brilliant job telling the story of the epic high-speed lengthways traverse of the Tararua Range in New Zealand's lower North Island.Some wonderful old footage of the pioneers talking about this crazy idea they had and their incredible adventures mixed with the story of Andy and his mates attempting it over the last few years. Some of the scenery is amazing (even though it's not far from the Capital, parts of the trail are incredibly remote).It's a sort of kiwi version of the Bob Graham round for UK Fell Runners - reminded me of Richard Askwith book 'Feet in the Clouds'.Even if you're not into mountain running it's a great watch (and a great promo for NZ's back country!).",False
7,10,A cinematic love letter to a cult classic New Zealand trail,mjvkfx,n/a,15/08/2025,"A cinematic love letter to a cult classic trail run and one of New Zealand's first and most enduring mountain traverses. First-time film-maker Andy Carruthers has done a fine job of capturing the special kind of madness required to run or shuffle 80km and climb up and down nearly 7,000m. And in this short film he also tells the stories of the first-timers who set the route, and the community of runners and hikers who continue to chase glory on the S-K. The traverse itself is a tortuous and sinewy route across windswept mountain ridges and through medieval goblin forests. There is joy and pain within!",False
8,10,Great balance of history and story,dion-40448,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had never heard of the Tararua SK, until I purchased this. Great movie. You learn the history of the SK and hear some legendary stories and endeavours from these pioneering men and women. And weaved in around this is the story of today's Guys running it. Really compelling. Some of the cinema photography is amazing. The story and movie have been really well thought through, and remember too that this isn't a multi million dollar deal, it's just the best grassroots portrayal you could hope for. I really want to do it now. Though I'll be sure to take something other than olive oil to fuel my run.",False
9,10,Next best thing to being out there on the tops,graemecurwen,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a much younger fella I read about Graeme Dingle taking off along the length of the Tararuas, setting off to challenge himself against the landscape. That didn't just strike a chord with me, it got my whole orchestra howling. I've been chasing landscapes and challenge most my life thanks to the inspirators like Dingle.NOW, the modern bunch of adventure loonies are pushing envelopes wider and into smaller time spaces, and I love it!!!Their stories absolutely need telling.The film Tararua S-K is a gobsmackingly beautiful rendition of everything that comes with pushing hard. Sometimes falling short.Sometimes reaching goals.Sometimes smashing down barriers.Sometimes derailing.Sometimes doing whatever needs to be done.I'll probably watch it a dozen times and still want more.",False
10,10,Keeping it real,occasionalclimber,n/a,15/08/2025,"As Andy mentions early in his film, the S-K isn't world famous - you have to dig a little. And that's what he's done in his film, through his own personal experiences and by interviewing and going out onto the route with other S-Kers. The end result is absolute authenticity.I've never attempted the S-K, but have spent plenty of time on Tararua trails. Having seen this film I feel like I now have a realistic and vivid sense of it. Beyond 'doing it' the film also captures the culture and camaraderie that the S-K community shares. What a magnificent thing to do. What a magnificent thing to watch, enjoy and admire. This film captures the essence of Tararua and of S-K, warts and all - the only way to do it justice.Your film is a gift Andy. Congratulations and thank you.",False
11,10,Stunning!,karentaylor-89021,n/a,15/08/2025,"A privileged glimpse into the minds and mindsets of those who live for days like these. Glad you finally completed it, Andy. Incredible job by you and all who worked on the film, and contributed to it. I'm glad it continues to break new ground for you with Air New Zealand snaffling it for their clientele in the skies, flying over mountainous ranges. Not to mention the Selections for Film Festivals and awards so far.Love that it is being offered to schools to inspire our young'uns to get out there like, IRL.Best of luck with this gift that keeps on giving. We'll be watching OK some of us from our couches lol.",False

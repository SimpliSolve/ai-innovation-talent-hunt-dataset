1,1,Made by foil hats by foil hats,marin_azur88,n/a,15/08/2025,"So much disinfirmation crammed into 1 hour its hard to keep track of all the crazy. But what can you expect when its made by foil hats? The only ones who enjoy this are people who killed their one braincell and are incapable of critical thinking. This sad attempt at a ""documentary"" lacks everything that makes a serious documentary such as credible sources, fact checking, journalistic intergrity ect. Its very obvious that its foil hat propaganda trying to be a documentary and failing badly at that. Do something better with your time. This is diarrhea in video form and should be treated as such.",False
2,1,Dishonest Deplorable Nonsense,zumbifilmes,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fake news taken to a surreal level. Exactly the kind of dishonest and distorted propaganda you'd expect coming from the people involved.Ranging from insane conspiracy theories to just plain political dishonesty, riddled with hypocrisy and specifically designed to cater to the kind of brainless sheep that gleefully gobble up this kind of slop.It would be surreal that supporters of the most corrupt president in US history would even open their mouths to talk about corruption, however it is (sadly) predictable. The far right simply wouldn't exist without misguided hate and disinformation; it is the lifeblood of their movement.Anyone with an iota of awareness can immediately tell that this is a shameful and poorly produced piece of political propaganda which serves no purpose other than to further fuel the ignorance and hatred of its followers. Deplorable.Produced by Steve Bannon and Kash Patel. What else could be exected?",False
3,9,Great and eye opening movie,cdbaconbro,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary show many things the left did during the 2016 election to indict trump and get him impeached. ""Government Gangsters"" delivers a gripping portrayal of corruption and power dynamics within political institutions. The film's taut narrative keeps viewers on edge, revealing the dark underbelly of government operations. Strong performances by the cast enhance the authenticity of the storyline, with standout roles bringing depth to the complex characters. The direction is sharp, maintaining a brisk pace that aligns well with the intense plot. However, some plot points feel underdeveloped, leaving viewers craving more resolution. Overall, ""Government Gangsters"" is a compelling watch that incisively critiques systemic corruption.",False
4,10,Brilliant Documentary,simplicityprofessor,n/a,15/08/2025,"Kash Patel presents a compelling fact-filled chronology of high-level government corruption. This film exposes the lies of the mainstream media, bad Democratic actors, and select Establishment Republicans who have been politically persecuting both Donald Trump and those who embrace him. Given that Patel (if confirmed) is likely to sweep the FBI, it is unsurprising to read critical reviews. I noticed none of those reviews provide anything substantial to refute Patel's claims; instead, they are ad hominem attacks which (logic dictates) should be dismissed. This film is loaded with valuable information, so it deserves at least a second viewing.",False
5,10,Excellent-Shocking Government Deep State,rpenna-60710,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have spent a lifetime reviewing and uncovering government cover-ups, and in no time in history has the Federal Government been more corrupt and controlled by mobsters/gangsters! This documentary should wake Americans to just how deep the rabbit hole goes!The Clinton Foundation has funded and backed attacks on anyone who opposes the Democrats' doctrine.Kash Patel provides a detailed description. Just how deep state government gangsters utilize the DOJ, the FBI, and the NSA in order to manipulate the media and control the American public.It is evident in today's political climate and the attacks on the Trump administration and anyone in the Republican party just how egregious these attacks are and they're willing to do anything to stop them.",False
6,7,"Important content, very annoying music",thuwe,n/a,15/08/2025,"A 10 for the important and revealing content. Even though one should verify everything that is shared in this documentary of course.Documentary... That's a movie that documents facts, events, nature, constructions and so much more.It has to inform people not make them go crazy with constant music as if it was an action movie or some drama.If there's something that the US is very good at, among many other things, it is making movies but sometimes they seem to forget they shouldn't apply this action, thrilling aspect to a documentary.And if the music was every now and then I wouldn't even have written about it, but is present practically without pause.If you want to convince the Europeans to watch it I'd suggest to lower the music's volume or take it away all together. It's about the content, not the action pack.So that's a 3 for the way the documentary is made.That would make it a 6.5 but there's no half points to be given here so I'll make it a 7 because it's a very important document.",False

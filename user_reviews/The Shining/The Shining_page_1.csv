1,9,timeless terror,yancyscott1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone to not get freaked out by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense ""writing""... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script.",False
2,9,Cabin Fever,richardchatten,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stephen King was so horrified at what Stanley Kubrick did to his 1977 novel he felt it necessary to later write his own alternative version for TV. Dismissed at the time as an anticlimax the pendulum of history quickly swung in the opposite direction, where it remains today.Seldom commented upon is the obvious influence on Kubrick of 'Last Year in Marienbad' - already apparent in '2001' - with its endless tracks through an enormous soulless hotel in the middle of nowhere to the accompaniment of a glacial music score, within which Kubrick stages at least two moments worthy of his name for which the film has been carefully preparing us for over an hour: the discovery by Shelly Duvall exactly what her husband (played by Jack Nicholson as if he's auditioning for the role of Richard III) has been labouring on since his arrival and that she and her son are trapped in the middle of nowhere completely at the mercy of a maniac, and the final track into the photograph of Nicholson among the revellers on July 4th 1921 which is quite an ending but - like so much else in the film - to which there is probably far less than meets the eye.",False
3,9,Amazing achievement in filmmaking and the art of terror.,FlickJunkie,n/a,15/08/2025,"Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.Rating: 9/10",False
4,10,"Forty years on, and it's still outstanding.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Kubrick, King and Nicholson, the writing was literally on the wall, and I don't mean RedRum, forty years on, and The Shining is still a masterpiece.Kubrick takes King's fantastic book, and builds on it, bringing the story to life in his own inimitable way. It's dark, it's bleak, it's terrifying, a masterpiece in storytelling. You watch as the central character's mental collapse is played out in a spine chilling fashion.Gorgeous camera work, incredible visuals, that opening is iconic. So many incredible, visual moments, the twins, lift, barman etc, no wonder it's been parodied multiple times over the years, famously by The Simpsons.An iconic role for Jack Nicholson, he is incredible, well supported by a terrific cast.It's a classic, 10/10.",False
5,n/a,Best Horror Film I've Ever Seen,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"When this film first came out in 1980, I remember going to see it on opening night. The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing ""The Shining"" was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I've ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lens shots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And ""funny"" because of Jack Nicholson's outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may, there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Highly, highly recommended. - Paul",False
6,10,One of my favorite films,Smells_Like_Cheese,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Shining, you know what's weird about this movie? This is the movie that everyone, for people who claim to not like horror films, will always say that The Shining is a terrific film. This is Stanley Kubrick's classic vision of Stephen King's horror tale of madness and blood. This is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not, you have heard of it, know a few lines from it, and know some of the classic images. Who could forget Jack's ""Here's Johnny!""? Who could forget ""All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy""? Who could forget that chilling ending? This is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is Kubrick's best work. I know there is a lot of argument in that department, a lot of people say it's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. Strangelove, but if those film pioneered film making, then The Shining perfected it. This is the tale of isolation, madness, terrifying images, and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin.Jack Torrance, Jack's son Danny, and Jack's wife, Wendy arrive at the Overlook Hotel on closing day. The elderly African-American chef, Dick Hallorann, surprises Danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream. He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift; they called the communication ""shining."" Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237. Dick tells Danny that the hotel has a certain ""shine"" to it and many memories, not all of them good, and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances. Danny's curiosity about Room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened. Danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after Jack tells Wendy that he loves his family. Seeing this, Wendy thinks Jack has been abusing Danny. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Danny starts calling out the word ""redrum"" frantically, and scribbling it on walls. He goes into a trance, and withdraws; he now says that he is Tony, his own ""imaginary friend."" Jack sabotages the hotel radio, cutting off communication from the outside world, but Hallorann has received Danny's telepathic cry for help and is on his way. Wendy discovers that Jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" formatted in various ways. Horrified, Jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat, locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen. Jack converses with Grady through the door of the locker, which then unlocks releasing him. Danny has written ""REDRUM"" in lipstick on the door of Wendy's bedroom. When she looks in the mirror, she sees that it is ""Murder"" spelled backwards. Jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters. ""Here's Johnny!"", and Jack's legendary image is born.The Shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see, this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares. Jack Nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable. But one I also feel is extremely overlooked is Shelley Duvall, her scene of finding Jack's rant All Work is incredible, that's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad. Also another incredible scene is when Jack sees a ghost woman in the bathtub, it's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema. The reason this film is so well known is because it's a film of perfection, it's been on The Simpsons, it's been shown in other films and it's a film that will forever stay with you when you see it, trust me.10/10",True
7,10,An absolute classic. Even if it does stray away from the novel.,b_kite,n/a,15/08/2025,"While I can understand a lot of Stephen King's arguments over Kubrick's vision, including casting Jack Nicholson who instead of a descent into madness looks insane from the first frame.

8,9,Amazing Watch!,Counterparts42,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of those films that is a classic for a reason.It's been on my list of movies to watch forever and a day and I finally got to it in 2023.This is an experience, masterfully shot and some of the most intense and engaging performances I have ever seen.Nicholson and Duvall have a complex chemistry that works at so many levels, which is essential to the make up of this story and anchors the first class direction.This is cinematically spectacular, the sets and the the design of this film is isolating, terrifying and captivatingly beautiful all at the same time.Worth all of the accolades and hype, even at 43 years old this film delivers in spades.",False
9,10,Straight Up,BenjaminPopkin,n/a,15/08/2025,"The sound, editing, camera and mise en scene are all utilized perfectly. A perfect score, framing, cinematography, camera work, set, production design, acting, storytelling, and not only just a perfect horror movie, but a perfect film. This film is what all great films STRIVE to be. The highest of film standards.The Shining is a masterwork of creating mood, setting tone, and developing an atmosphere. The score is one of the best and most iconic scores of all time. As well as the most eerie.This is honestly my favorite of all Stanley Kubrick's films. The Shining is a masterpiece of cinema *chefs kiss*The only thing that is a negative imo is that if your not completely invested in the movie and ready to sit down and watch, you will get bored. It's lengthy, but worth it once your totally engrossed in the film. Especially for your first viewing. You gotta pay attention.",False
10,10,A MASTERPIECE LIKE NO OTHER,azemillancy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Whenever we hear the name Stanley Kubrick, the poster, scene or a shot from The Shining will come to our mind - most probably "" Here's Johnny!"". For a legendary filmmaker like Kubrick who has multiple masterpieces to his credit, would still be fine if he had never even made this film. But still, there would be some great missing which will be felt! That's because of The Shining's ability to penetrate the viewer's mind, even the subconscious, and imprint an influence in its deeper depths. How the movie hooks the viewer with its horror which is created from several dimensions is a remarkable factor that makes this film an all-perfect masterpiece that is thrilling and exciting even after watching it umpteen times.How Kubrick created the horror, just one among the many factors that make the film a great one (still a very important one though), is so deep and mind-blowing, he builds tension in the viewer with enough substance written in the screenplay to showcase on the screen, and perfectly well-tuned and tastefully directed horror. Most importantly, the background music and sounds have immense depth with its structuring crafted to the innermost core and the finely touched upper layers. The actors give performances that are dramatically aesthetic and showcase facial expressions that are realistic to the utmost extent. As the film progresses the anticipation for something scary to expect in the upcoming scenes is created successfully and the anticipation that it created is also executed by scaring the viewer with horrors of huge intensity.One thing that is found in this film is something of a variety. It's the portrayal of the supernatural in a very realistic manner, which is done in a subtle way that doesn't let the viewer know that it's a realistic portrayal of the supernatural he won't even care to notice it. Because that's how successfully it's done. And what's the use of it? It has an impact on the viewer which affects how he perceives the film, and that too which will be something of an advantage for the filmmaker.I don't intend to say anything about the story of the film, whether it's supernatural horror or the breakdown of a madman's mind, is still debated among cinephiles, even 40 years after the film's release. And that's also a thing which makes the film a great one! Rather than just showing what the maker wants to show, Kubrick lets the viewer decide what the film is, by making him analyse the film from his perspective and come up with an interpretation. This is a form of interactive cinema, an indirect one though.The Shining is one of the greatest horror masterpieces or even one of the best films of all time.",False
11,6,I can see why people like it,portraitofaladyonfire,n/a,15/08/2025,"My expectation were to high. I expected a masterpiece, but in the end I found it just mediocre. Dont get me wrong the acting and the camera work are great. Storywise I couldnt really get invested in it. In terms of horror except the twins it wasn't scary at all in my opinion.",False
12,10,A masterpiece of psychological horror,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Shining"" by Stanley Kubrick explores the question of who is the reliable observer and whose ideas of events can be trusted. The opening scene at a job interview introduces Jack Torrance, a man who plans to live in solitude with his wife and son at the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns him about a former caretaker who murdered his wife and two daughters, but Jack assures him that this will not happen. His wife, a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict, is likely to be fascinated by the story. Jack, Wendy, and Danny move into a hotel during winter shutdown, where the chef, Dick Hallorann, explains the food storage locker. They are left alone, and Jack works tirelessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny create a routine of everyday life, including breakfast cereal, toys, and TV. The three don't seem to function as a loving family, as they are constantly occupied with their daily routines. The question remains whether people will talk about real tragedies or if Jack will ever tell his wife about it. Danny, a reliable witness, is influenced by Tony, who channels psychic input, including a vision of blood spilling from hotel elevators and two matching girls. However, these visions may not accurately represent the actual events. Wendy, a companion and playmate for Danny, has a matter-of-fact banality similar to Shelley Duvall's ""3 Women."" She tries to cheer Jack up until he abruptly stops interrupting his work. Wendy later discovers the reality of his work, and is reliable at that moment and later when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he becomes violent. The opening shots of Jack wending his way up the Colorado mountains are a sign of what's to come. The eerie Moog interpretation of Hector Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique, the mirroring of the landscape against a placid lake, and the breathless whoosh of the camera are all signs of what's to come. With Steadicam mounts, Kubrick experiments with how a constantly roving camera can unmoor an audience. Even in the benign early scenes of Jack heading to the interview or the Torrance clan getting a tour of the hotel, it feels like a game of chicken. As the Torrances settle into The Overlook for the winter and a snowstorm severs their connection to the outside world, the madness that quickly seizes Jack ramps up a whole strategy of disorientation. Kubrick makes a joke out of titles announcing different days of the week, as if time has any meaning in isolation. The geography of The Overlook is impossible to map, with the kitchen, living quarters, Gold Room, upper floors, and Room 237 all distinct spaces that are impossible to connect.",False
13,6,A major disappointment.,Chromium_5,n/a,15/08/2025,"This has got to be the most overrated movie in the history of film. I just watched it for the first time, expecting the best of the best, and it was quite a letdown. The sets and music are great, of course, but Kubrick seems to have forgotten one very important thing: to make a horror movie horrifying, you have to have likable characters. That way, when bad things start happening, the audience feels for them.What we have here, however, is a documentary on the most dysfunctional family in the world. Isn't this supposed to be about a loving husband and father who goes insane? Jack Nicholson is brilliant at portraying total insanity, but there's no gradual shift into at all. He looks like he's about to snap from scene one. His wife is a whimpering, nervous wreck who does not seem to trust him at any point throughout the movie. And the kid, Danny, is just a weird little nut. Who can identify with these people?Another major problem is that there is no clear storyline here. The whole first half of the movie is about the kid's psychic abilities, and then it does a total switch and focuses on Jack Nicholson being crazy. What was the point of spending all that time on Danny? It seems like it is foreshadowing something, but it never amounts to anything. I guess Danny is the first one to see ghosts in the house, but that is not a big enough plot point to spend the entire first half of the movie on.Other than some incredibly creepy music and sets, there is nothing really scary in this movie. It is fun to see Jack Nicholson ham it up, of course, but there is no scariness involved when you spend the entire movie waiting listlessly for him to pick up an ax, rather than being shocked when he goes from lovable to psychotic. Instead, he goes from obviously-wanting-to-release-a-ton-of-built-up-aggression to psychotic, which is extremely inferior.6/10 stars, and that is being generous.",False
14,5,Equivocation,neil-476,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a difficult review to write. You see, I've just posted comments on Ella Enchanted where I comment that, as someone who has never read the book, the film is absolutely fine. But it's difficult for me to approach Stanley Kubrick's The Shining on that basis because, you see, I've read Stephen King's The Shining.If I do my absolute best to put the book out of my mind, I suppose that the film must be acknowledged as a tolerable horror, with two major flaws - one, it's overlong, and what should be a slow burn loaded with increasing dread becomes simply boring, and two, Jack Nicholson's established screen persona means that there is absolutely no suspense in his development from decent though flawed father/husband to scenery-chewing maniac - the final madness is there from the first frame he appears in.If you've never read the book and you're a horror fan, then you'll probably enjoy it - no huge surprises, but it ticks most of the boxes. And it looks very good.But what a missed opportunity! Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a film about a man who goes mad in a haunted hotel. Stephen King's The Shining is a novel about an evil entity which inhabits a hotel, and which wants to consume a boy's psychic power: the boy is strong enough to resist it, so it works on the weakest link, the father, and gradually erodes everything which made him a good, decent man. Jack's transition from the decent though weak man he starts out as, to the point where the Overlook is in control of his every action, is absolutely central to Stephen King's The Shining, and it could only have worked on screen if Jack was portrayed by an actor who was initially credible as a decent, gentle man. Not Nicholson - I love him, but he was (in my view) a spectacular piece of miscasting for this movie. Picture Dustin Hoffman, Harrison Ford, or someone similar, and how dramatic and shocking their descent to axe-wielding maniachood would have been.The contrast is essential to Stephen King's story: with Nicholson, there was no contrast.It is also worth commenting that King's The Shining is about a man who loves his family: Kubrick's The Shining is stated, by the screenwriter in one of the DVD documentaries, to be about a man who hates his family. A fairly fundamental difference, yes?Ah well. ""What if""s never got us anywhere. Go and see Stanley Kubrick's The Shining anyway, and enjoy Jack Nicholson chewing scenery. The scenery's pretty good eye candy and, besides, he does it so well.",False
15,n/a,A truly brilliant and scary film from Stanley Kubrick.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI can't praise this film long enough!The Shining is, without doubt, one of Stanley Kubrick's undisputed masterpieces and a true classic in horror cinema. It is a film that, over the course of the years, has managed to scare the living hell out of its audiences (and still does). The film is an adaptation of Stepehen King's original novel, written in the late '70s, and although the film is not very loyal to the book, it still stands as a thing of its own.Right from the beginning, as we contemplate the car going to the hotel from those stunning aerial shots, deeply inside us we know that something in the film, somehow, sometime is going to go wrong. As we obtain that severe warning, an almost inaudible voice gently whispers to us 'sit tight', a sense of unexpectedness invades us all, and it is that very same feeling that makes our hair stand on end throughout out the entire movie.The plot is simple: Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) becomes the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in up in the secluded mountains of Colorado. Jack, being a family man, takes his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) to the hotel to keep him company throughout the long, isolated nights. During their stay, strange things occur when Jack's son Danny sees gruesome images powered by a force called 'the shining' and Jack is heavily affected by this. Along with writer's block and the demons of the hotel haunting him, Jack has a complete mental breakdown and the situation takes a sinister turn for the worse.The film, unlike many horror-oriented films nowadays, doesn't only rely on stomach-churning and gory images (which it does contain, anyway) but on the incredibly scary music based on the works of Béla Bartók and on the excellent cinematography (the Steadicam is superbly used, giving us a sense of ever-following evil), as well. The terrifying mood and atmosphere of the film is carefully and masterfully woven by Kubrick, who clearly knows how to really make a horror movie.Jack Nicholson's powerful performance as the mad father and husband is as over the top as it is brilliant. Shelley Duvall, who plays the worrying wife who tries to help her son, is also a stand out; she shows a kind of trembling fear in many scenes and is able to display weakness and vulnerability in a very convincing way. Undoubtedly, The Shining is full of memorable moments (the elevator scene or the 'Heeeeeere's Johnny' one-liner for instance) and, simply put, it's flawlessly brilliant.Stanley Kubrick's direction is pure excellence, giving the whole film a cold and atmospheric look, thus creating an unbearable sense of paranoia and terror. There are moments of sheer brilliance and exquisite perfection in this film; the horrifying maze chase is a perfect example. Every single shot is masterfully created and there are some genuinely scary scenes which will make you sit on the edge of your seat.The Shining is, in my opinion, a special landmark in horror cinema which will always be regarded as one of the scariest movies in film history. Since I saw it last year, when I was 13, I have rarely been able to have a bath in my bathtub.Just in case, ya know. Overall, The Shining is incomparably the scariest film I've ever seen in my whole life (and I can tell you I've seen a great deal of horror films).It is an unforgettable, chilling, majestic and truly, profoundly scary film crafted by an eccentric genius who wants to show that the impossible can be done. The Shining is a sublime, hauntingly intriguing and endlessly watchable film that shows Kubrick at his best.",True
16,10,The greatest horror movie of all time.,Anonymous_Maxine,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOkay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. I mean, The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but The Shining is way up there. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. It's better than The Stand, better than Pet Sematary (if not quite as scary), better than Cujo, better than The Green Mile, better the Dolores Claiborne, better than Stand By Me (just barely, though), and yes, it's better than The Shawshank Redemption (shut up, it's better), I don't care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says.I read that, a couple of decades ago, Stanley Kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie, and from the other room, his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration. Finally, she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours, and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something (I tell this with all due respect, of course), she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand, and the book was The Shining. And thank God, too, because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever.Stephen King can be thanked for the complexity of the story, about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing. Jack Nicholson can be thanked for his dead-on performance as Jack Torrance (how many movies has Jack been in where he plays a character named Jack?), as well as his flawless delivery of several now-famous lines (`Heeeeeere's Johnny!!'). Shelley Duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to Jack's desires to kill her. Stanley Kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch, and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls.One of the most significant aspects of this movie, necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect, is the isolation, and it's presents flawlessly. The film starts off with a lengthy scene following Jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter. This is soon followed by the same thing following Jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel. This time the scene is intermixed with shots of Jack, Wendy, and Danny talking in the car, in which Kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of TV, as Wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of Danny, who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on TV (`See? It's okay, he saw it on the television.').The hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place, and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge, echoing rooms and the long hallways. These rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel, but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie, and Kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel. Early in the film, there is a famous tracking shot that follows Danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his Big Wheel (is that what those are called?), and his relative speed (as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner. And being a Stephen King story, you EXPECT something to jump out at you. I think that the best scene in the halls (as well as one of the scariest in the film) is when Danny is playing on the floor, and a ball rolls slowly up to him. He looks up and sees the long empty hallway, and because the ball is something of a child's toy, you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him. Anyway, you get the point. The Shining is a damn scary movie.Besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck, The Shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. HAD Jack always been there, like Mr. Grady told him in the men's room? Was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? If he has always been the caretaker, as Mr. Grady also said, does that mean that it was HIM that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not Mr. Grady, after all? It's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, that's just mediocre filmmaking. For example, The Amityville Horror, which obviously copied much of The Shining as far as its subject matter, did this. But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of Kubrick's movies are). One more thing that we can all thank Stanley Kubrick for, and we SHOULD thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.",True
17,10,Favourite horror as a kid but a masterpiece now that i am grown,tatjanabollen,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Shining was my favourite horror movie as a kid. Born in 1988 i think i watched this movie more than 10 times. But being a kid i offcourse did not understand the psychological drama behind it in full. I am now watching this after 15+ years again with my 12 year old son, who is obsessed with the horror genre. But is more of the type of horror like Saw. Not even 30 minutes into the movie, with actually nothing really happening, he is scared to death. And even me, who watched this movie so many times, but not for a very long time, have a scary feeling in my stomach. The music is really the best actor in this whole movie. All the time you are wondering what is going to happen next. Even though at the beginning, nothing is really happening. The actors are perfect for their roles. The whole movie you have this uncomfortable feeling, but you can't really place it. The Shining really shows that you dont need a lot of scary stuff and action in a movie to make it scary.",False
18,8,One of the scariest movies ever---8/10,Sfpsycho415,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10",False
19,9,Horror classic that newer films should idolize.,ttrebonto,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first time I watched this film, four years ago, when I was like 11, felt very boring. But recently I watched it and watched explanation videos about it and now feel like it is definitely one of the greatest horror films of all time, thinking of the effort it took to make this film back in 1980. Definitely gonna check out some more from Kubrick.",False
20,9,The best creepy horror movie involving isolation n eeriness. Also it captured the fear of the unseen in one of the best way.,Fella_shibby,n/a,15/08/2025,"I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs, then again in the early 2k on a dvd which I own. Revisited the 144 mins director's cut recently as i am anxious to check out Doctor Sleep n the tv version of The Shining.Everything has already been said about this film n there seems to be little left to say but as a fan of horror movies (especially to do with isolation n eeriness), lemme contribute by praising how good this film is n at the same time why it doesn't deserve a full 10.The film has solid amount of tension n scare factor.The vast isolation, the snow capped peaks, the valleys, the mountains, the narrow, winding roads, the snow covered roads, the eerie corridors, they all add to the film's narration.The start scene wher Jack is driving and the background music, itself gives goosebumps n a sign that something sinister is awaiting.On a technical level this film is gr8, the music, the visuals, the camera angles, etc all add to it except the lead actor Nicholson.Nicholson was already well known for playing unstable characters and his character Jack in this film is shown to be a bit wierd from the beginning.They shud have asked him to potray a normal family loving person in the beginning n later show the gradual transition into madness n possession.Who wud discuss Donner Party in front of a kid?Also the way Jack gives an evilish smile when his kid tells about watching cannibalism on tv.What kinda parent wud approve of that?Also most of the time Jack's behavior is more laughable.Even when he is hit on the head by his wife n he falls down, it is a big lol.",False
21,10,"No jump scares, but it sends chills down your spine",mattlx,n/a,15/08/2025,"Kubrick totally nails it with the creepy and suffocating vibe in the movie. The Overlook Hotel is like a character in itself, and those twisty hallways add to the mounting tension.Jack Nicholson goes down in history with his bone-chilling performance as Jack Torrance. He goes from normal to nuts in a way that's both horrifying and mesmerizing. He's basically the face of the movie's unsettling vibes.This film is all about messing with your head. It slowly peels back the sanity layers of its characters, keeping you guessing whether what you're seeing is real or just madness playing tricks on you.",False
22,6,The book is better,elliotjeory,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watching this after reading the book I can see why Stephen king was annoyed with it.Jack Nicholson looked unhinged from the beginning which means there isn't much difference in his decent into madness.Certain characters from the book are left out, where are the bees? Where are the moving ani mail bushes? The boiler is barely mentioned.The direction is brilliant and I love the blood down the elevator shaft scene.",False
23,9,Not so scary incredible film,akdjreview,n/a,15/08/2025,"Horror films are not my cup of tea. But The Shining has gotten me to reconsider this preference. With an incredible performance by Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, I might even say it is one of the best I've ever seen. Meanwhile, considering this movie is a horror film, it always keeps you on your toes. While also being a compact story and with few actors making the film more intriguing and heart wrenching.The Shining is a disturbing film from the 80s. It's not so much scary for the audience, but there's always a creepy feeling luring over you. With Jack Nicholson in the lead role, performing one of the best roles I've seen. Playing a so convincing role It's almost frightening. With so many memorable scenes it's impressive how well the actors performed.Meanwhile, the storyline during the entire film is disturbing and alluring, it also manages to be beautiful. Director Stanley Kubrick managed to create a masterpiece. With beautiful angels, use of lightning and scenes. I can tell you that there is no error in the creation of this masterpiece.I highly recommend you watch The Shining. Truly one of the best horror films ever made. And if you don't like horror movies or fear them The Shining is not so frightening.",False
24,6,Hugely overrated.,minastrate,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's just okay. Like, nice to watch but, kinda' boring until the last third of the film; by which point it becomes pretty epic! But the whole ""build up"" thing just falls flat on me; just seems kind of unnecessary. And unfortunately I wouldn't consider the entire film worth it after a single watch. But, hey, that's just my two cents.",False
25,5,Overrated,Chiller7,n/a,15/08/2025,"Once again, I decided to check out a highly regarded ""cinematic masterpiece"" and was left kinda disappointed. Scariest movie of all time? No, not really. It wasn't even particularly scary.Admittedly, a lot of it was well done. The little girls were the best part. They were great. The steadicam shots through the hallways were pretty cool. There was a good sense of ""What horrors could be lurking around the corner?"" as the camera follows the kid through the halls.But aside from those things, much of the movie didn't work so well. Jack Nicholson was more hilarious than menacing. Was that intentional? His witty dialogue provided many laughs, but watching him slowly stumbling around holding an axe was hardly what I'd call horror.The story was completely nonsensical. What was any of that? There's no explanation for almost everything that happens in the movie! Here's where I'll probably get derided by the movie's fans for not ""getting it,"" but I'm convinced this is really a case where the movie-makers themselves had no clue what it all meant. They just threw all this random imagery at us just to confuse us and convince us that it's actually brilliant (because if we can't comprehend any of it, it must be brilliant, right?) but really it just makes zero sense.I don't get why this is so highly rated.",False

1,7,Dunaway Dearest? No But Can You Get Out of Her Eyeline?,EUyeshima,n/a,16/08/2025,"Faye Dunaway is a true movie star. I thought that when she exploded onscreen in ""Bonnie and Clyde"" in 1967, and still think that now 57 years later at age 83. Director Laurent Bouzereau covers both ends of her career spectrum and makes a valid attempt to uncover Dunaway's austere persona and explore the person underneath in this 2024 documentary. The problem though is that he doesn't do enough to counterbalance the personal revelations with her impressive career accomplishments, at least in ways that help us understand how she achieved such legendary work beyond a generalized level of commitment. For instance, it would've been good to hear Dunaway's side of Bette Davis' vitriolic comment about her on The Tonight Show rather than showing it as evidence of her difficult reputation. Instead we get clips that illustrate anecdotes about the filming process behind a classic like ""Chinatown"" (my favorite of her performances): a stray hair plucked by director Roman Polanski, the classic revelation scene with costar Jack Nicholson. The contrasting remembrances of her castmates on ""Mommie Dearest"" best illustrate the extreme opinions on Dunaway's uncompromising approach to character. The personal revelations are plentiful though sometimes cursory: her bipolar disorder and alcoholism (which explains several infamous episodes), the secrecy of her son Liam's adoption, various high-profile relationships with the likes of Marcello Mastroianni. Her cosmetic surgeries are unsurprisingly not mentioned, but the changes in her appearance are hard to ignore. Bouzereau illustrates that Dunaway was overdue for a bio documentary. I think an extra half-hour focused on her work beyond the film's ninety-minute running time would've improved it substantially.",False
2,6,"Oh, Faye!",ozjosh03,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a slapdash, disingenuous, occasionally weird and ultimately unsatisfying portrait of Faye Dunaway. It is also, quite conspicuously, a partisan attempt to rehabilitate her reputation, which has suffered more than a few blows over the years. But if you're going to include that clip of Bette Davis telling Johnny Carson that Faye is the only actor in Hollywood she'd never work with again, then you really need to properly address the accusations of divadom at a monster level, to which this doco only fleetingly alludes. Faye's cover-all response to stories about her being difficult is that - news flash - she's bi-polar. Since this has never been mentioned before, it would seem to be a very late-life diagnosis, and Faye is curiously vague on the details. Nevertheless, she deploys being bi-polar like a get-out-of-jail-free card, as a means of not addressing or dismissing all those allegations of being difficult, unprofessional, unreasonable and infuriating. But since it's that behaviour that pretty much de-railed her career, this just leaves a giant hole in the story of her life. For this film to really change perceptions about Dunaway, it needed to delve deeper and demand a bit more of Faye. Okay, so she behaved badly because she was off-kilter; but how does she feel about that - about the consequences for her, and about the impact it had on others? It also has to be said that it's a strange and motley selection of friends and colleagues who have been curated to talk on Faye's behalf. There's Rutanya Alda, who has previously dished for anyone who asked about Faye in diva mode on Mommie Dearest. There's the always annoying Columbia film professor Annette Insdorf, who is as emphatic as she is vacuous. There are a few actors and studio execs you've never heard of. And Sharon Stone, who at least has some insight into what happens to actresses in Hollywood beyond 40. Other than Sharon, there's not much in the way of insight and illumination. At best, Faye is a reminder of what a magnetic and compelling actor Dunaway was in her prime. But the picture quickly goes blurry once we get into the What-happened-Faye? Years, post Network. In the end, we can only hope some future documentarian dares to tackle The Legend of Faye Dunaway with a clearer vision and significantly more guts.",False

4,7,"Faye Dunaway, from the horse's mouth",paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Fay (2024 release; 91 min.) opens, it is ""March 28, 1977"" and Fay Dunaway wins the Oscar for Best Actress for her role in ""Network"". We see the iconic picture taken the morning after as Faye lays poolside with newspapers spread out and laying about (perhaps the most famous Oscar photo ever taken). Various talking heads gush about Faye's most famous performances. We then go back in time as Faye talks about her upbringing in the deep South... At this point we are less tahn 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from director Lauren Bouzereau (""Natalie Wood: What Remains Behind""). Here, with a big assist from Fay's son Liam, he manages to have extended one-on-one sit-downs with Faye as she reflects on her life and times. She openly discusses her ""difficult"" reputation, but also her bipolar disorder diagnosis. I was most interested in hearing what became of this famous actress once she was no longer so much in the limelight (from the late 1980's on). Please note that this documentary is simply called ""Faye"" (as seen in the opening credits), and not ""Faye: The Many Lives of Faye Dunaway"" (as advertised on HBO and Max).""Faye"" premiered at this year's Canned film festival to positive acclaim. A couple of weeks ago it started airing on HBO and streaming on Max, where I caught it just last night. This documentary is currently rated 100% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. While ""Faye"" is certainly a worthwhile documentary, that rating seems a bit overly generous to me. In any event, if you are a fan of Faye Dunaway or of Hollywood in the 1970s, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
5,6,We root for stars to climb that mountain until we want to push them off.,kevin-12921,n/a,16/08/2025,"I may have stolen some of the above title from an interview with the late, great Robin Williams I saw years ago.Still, all the elements were in place for what was going to happen after she had a decade on top of the film industry:
1. From Bonnie & Clyde through Network she could do no wrong. (That period also included her Academy Award for Network)
2. As she approached her 40s life for all actors, especially women, becomes difficult. Remember, the age of the average movie going customer is 24.5 years old.3. She rubbed people the wrong way. I don't recall her working with any of her leading men-many of which stayed on top for years after-working with her in projects.4. Do you really think that the director, Frank Perry, of Mommie Dearest would have been listened to if he told her to ""pull it back""?What comes up must come down. Faye Dunaway needs no excuses for how her career went. This documentary tries to put a lot of square pegs into round holes to convince us otherwise.",False
6,6,Faye Dearest,akoaytao1234,n/a,16/08/2025,"Faye is a standard documentary about the life of Faye Dunaway, the biggest female star of the New Hollywood movement as she addresses all the controversy she was in.Not much to be honest. It was quite a standard affair in terms of how she is portrayed. Nothing uber negative, she kind of tries to dispel a lot of rumors in this BUT it persist to this day anyhow.BUT the biggest takeaway in this film is that Polansky and that guy here really think tugging a bunch of hair of an actress should not elicit any reaction. What an misogynistic action from them.Also, it seems like Faye is mentally unstable in a lot of her infamous period AND has been trying to medicate herself to control her condition which was admirable.",False
7,9,"Provocative and brash, blunt doc that tells the highs and lows of a legendary actress.",blanbrn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Faye Dunaway was one of my favorite actresses she always played each role in such a classy and elegant and very sexy way. This ""HBO"" doc called just plain ""Faye"" is a treat and delight for any of her fans, as Dunaway is interviewed and she reflects on her life and Florida upbringing till her journey thru stage into the studios, as she becomes a fine actress. The footage is vintage and it brings back memories for all film buffs and fans of Faye, as during the 70's she was the queen of the big screen. Certainly her highs were ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Chinatown"", and ""Network"" and Dunaway talks very frank about the good times of stardom. Yet the bad times were mentioned like her over the top choices when she did ""Mommie Dearest"", it proves that an acting life is not easy. On the revealing side of life is hearing from Faye's son Liam it was touching and memorable as they go thru old family photos. Along the way though Dunaway's life was no bed of roses as she dealt with mental health issues. Still thru it all this doc proves that pain and the ups and downs was what made Faye so super good and great, a must watch for any old film fan.",False
8,7,"Not a puff-piece...but not overly insightful, either.",moonspinner55,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary for HBO Films on American actress Faye Dunaway from director Laurent Bouzereau doesn't really ask ""Who is Faye Dunaway?"" as much as it does inform us ""This is Faye Dunaway"". Born in Florida in 1941 but transferred every two years with her parents and younger brother due to her father serving in the US Army, Dorothy Faye learned early it didn't pay to hang onto relationships for very long. Eventually settling back in Florida with her divorced mother, Dunaway had already caught the acting bug during a previous living stint in Utah before graduating high school, where she finally won a local beauty contest after several tries (""de rigueur"" for any young lady hoping to make it in the arts). Dunaway's early acting life on the New York stage and at Lincoln Center may be surprising to fans not familiar with her salad days--but once she's brought to Hollywood, ""Faye"" falls into a typical biography pattern (selecting highlights of her movie career and skittering around her two failed marriages). As to Dunaway's reputation as a tyrant, she blames most of her bad choices and behavior on bipolar/manic depression (now being treated with medication) and alcoholism (which she inherited from her father). She says cruelty isn't a part of who she naturally is, though her temperament may be viewed that way by those in her line of fire during a film shoot. Of the co-workers, family and friends who give recent interviews, Sharon Stone's overdramatic gushing is the most embarrassing; however, Faye's now-grown adopted son Liam from her years with photographer Terry O'Neill is able to help show off his mother's heretofore unseen tender side. For fans, this is an enjoyable watch with film clips and vintage interviews (Bette Davis's complaints about working with Dunaway are shared but not acknowledged). ""Faye"" isn't a puff-piece, though it isn't overly insightful, choosing to let Dunaway remain an imposing enigma. *** from ****",False
9,9,Interesting and well-made documentary about a movie star,dakjets,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long, long time. In my opinion, a good documentary must be honest, insightful and entertaining. All this can be found here.Faye Dunaway's career has been long and rich. She may be unknown to many younger moviegoers. It's been a few years since she was an active movie star. This movie reminds us all of her greatness. And that at the height of her career she played in some of the biggest and most important films of the 70s, such as Network.The documentary's great strength is that Faye herself is the narrator and contributes actively throughout the film, where she narrates in detail in chronological order about her most significant films, private life all the time seasoned with exciting anecdotes. In the documentary, she receives help from her own son, colleagues in the film industry and journalists with in-depth insight into her work. In sum, therefore, this film becomes very interesting and believable.After seeing the film, I wanted to revisit many of her great achievements on the silver screen, and I think I'll start with Bonnie and Clyde, which gets a thorough review here.",False

My older sister and I would and still all these years later recite lines from that movie. I wasn't sure what to expect going into this documentary given what I had heard of Faye. I am truly enamored with her. What a wonderfully strong and courageous woman, friend and mother. She is legendary & I'm so thrilled that she is telling her story & speaking of her life then & now.

For the movies, it mainly focuses on a couple of movies - i.e. Her Oscar-winning role in ""Network"" - and how ""Mommie Dearest"" simply came out at the wrong point in history, leading people to scorn Dunaway as a joke.As for Dunaway's reputation for being temperamental, it turns out that's the result of bipolar disorder. Her son mentions that he can tell whether or not she's taken her prescribed medications.The point is that one gets to know not only this fine actress, but some of the history of cinema.

As feature-length documentaries do, it touches on a great deal with moments of some insight, but not deep examination.I appreciate getting to know better a personality I only understood through viewing their work (mostly as a much younger, less educated man) or through the sensationalizing lens of celebrity media ""reporting"" in the 70s.The documentary seemed to me to raise a new unanswered question: What show might we yet see Ms Dunaway in?And (this is not a film spoiler, just a projection of thoughts I brought as a viewer near the end of the film) the last half dozen views we have of Ms Dunaway made me think of a resemblance she has to Joni Mitchell. Might a quality Joni Mitchell biopic script be making the rounds? Maybe one that focuses on Joni's years after her major Pop success years, or that enables Dunaway to share the role with someone playing Joni's younger years?It's just an idea I want to put out there.",False

20,8,TOUGH BUT FAIR...!,masonfisk,n/a,16/08/2025,"A recent MAX documentary on the ever glamorous, ever cantankerous leading lady Faye Dunaway.

The 70's were arguably hers as she continued to nab high profile roles which would culminate in her Oscar win for Network in 1976. On the personal front she could not have a child of her own so her son, Liam, he being adopted, was welcomed w/open arms (his constant presence by her side at public functions illustrates their closeness) & her admitting her bi-polar status also humanized the actress who tended to be demonized as difficult.

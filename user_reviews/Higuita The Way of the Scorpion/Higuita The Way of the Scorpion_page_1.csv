1,10,I loved it,nataliabalci,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm Colombian and I have been living abroad for 22 years. Watching this documentary brought so many beautiful memories of my country. Despite the difficulties we all endured during that time it is great to see, the great things that occurred during that time. What an amazing story about Higuita's life.I did not know well about his cultural background, about his success coming from a humble neighborhood in Medellin. He is a true example of the Colombian spirit to surpass obstacles, doing things with strength and happiness to reach your goals.He makes me feel very proud of being Colombian. A must see!",False
2,9,im not much...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerInterrested in football/soccer, but the name higuita has imprinted itself into my brain stem, maybe as a primitive reaction to his callname '' the scorpion''.It was like the norwegian national soccer team ''the drillos''had a brandmark called ''the flo pass'', a very successfilled way to dump balls in the box, then headed in the goal or goal assist by giant jostein flo, making it to the world champs in usa 94 and france 98.So was higuita for the colombian team and country, being the libero/11th man with a very free role as goalkeeper as well as goaler. I remember he was a big star among norwegian periodistas these days, therefore a sting is waking me up each time i hear that name...so lets face it, this is a super bragging biographical documental colombiales, take it for what it is, interesting from start to end. A grumpy old mans recommend.",True

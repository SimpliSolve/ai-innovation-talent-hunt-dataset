3,9,Arguably the greatest sports documentary movie,ARR23,n/a,16/08/2025,A documentary on Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson. A documentary that sheds light on the dark days he went through to achieve the marvels which made him the living legend he is today. Hands down the best sport documentary movie I have ever seen.,False
4,10,Absolutely Brilliant! From an Arsenal Fan,amjadalnour,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you think you're about to see a documentary about football achievements, stats, and cup glories, you'll be so wrong.This film was made by Sir Alex's son, who had to be there in every aspect of his career. Who had to almost say goodbye to his father when he was struggling with his health ordeal in May 2018. In my opinion, you could never ask for a better perspective for this story to be told from.",False
5,10,A MUST WATCH!!,TreeFiddy53,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every once in a while, we get something that makes us want to keep our sporting rivalries aside and come together for the sport. This doc is one such time, it is a must watch for any football fan.The story is more about Fergie, his origins, values and beliefs and not about United, in case you're wondering.If you're a fan of Manchester United, this just might be a tear-jerker.As a doc, this was VERY WELL made, great shots, great music, great story telling, great color correction, etc. It's well less than 2 hours, I wished it had more. I can go on, but I'll stop here.",False
6,10,Must-watch for ANY football fan,davidrodal,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a documentary this is. It tells Sir Alex's life and journey in a touching and compelling way. Brought tears to my eyes and goosebumps for almost the entire movie.It doesn't even matter if you're a Manchester United-fan, you are going to love this documentary no matter what.GGMU.",False
7,10,Tear jerker,dazzarazza,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a great film, brought me to tears. Such a greatly put together film, showing the highs and lows of Fergies career, and how close to the edge of life he really was.There will never be a manager like him again in our life time. This film does a great job of showing how he hit the lows and got back up again.",False
8,7,A Legend of Resilience and Success,adorerreza,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In is a biographical documentary about the life and career of one of football's greatest managers. The film meticulously explores the professional and personal details of this coach, providing a deep look into his illustrious career. With exclusive interviews, archival footage, and detailed analysis, the documentary offers a comprehensive and credible portrait of a figure who changed the world of football. However, due to time constraints or the absence of some new details, it might have less appeal for some hardcore football fans. I enjoyed watching this documentary and learned some interesting points .",False

10,7,Fergie Time,Lejink,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film on the life and times of the great football manager Sir Alex Ferguson, whilst engrossing and entertaining had very much an ""authorised biography"" feel about it. Co-produced and directed by his son Jason Ferguson, it features numerous contributors by Ferguson's wife and other two children as well as pretty much a running commentary from the man itself.The film pivots on the date that Ferguson suffered a brain haemorrhage in 2018 interspersing his life story with interjections on this near-death experience and gradual recovery culminating in a return visit to Old Trafford on a match day, there to receive the adulation of his adoring fans.For me, the most interesting parts of the film were those relating to his childhood and initial breakthrough as a first-team player with his local team, Glasgow Rangers, the team he'd supported as a child. The story is told of how, after a painful Scottish Cup final defeat to city arch-rivals Celtic, where Ferguson was blamed for the opening goal conceded in a 4-0 loss, he was sacked from the club for the underlying reason of his marrying a devout Roman Catholic.Later, when he became manager of Aberdeen this rancorous memory fuelled his determination to end the domination in Scottish football of Celtic and in particular Rangers, which he did spectacularly, winning the league three times and also the European Cup Winners Cup against the mighty Real Madrid along the way.It's well known that he didn't succeed initially at Old Trafford taking three years to win a first trophy there before commencing an unparalleled run of success which only stopped when he retired in 2014, fittingly as English champions again, for the 13th time under his charge.There was only limited input from a small number, presumably hand-picked, of his past players, Gordon Strachan representing the Aberdeen years and the now disgraced Ryan Giggs and Eric Cantona the United years. They all tell anecdotes about the manager's sometimes bullying ways and never-say-die outlook, which all came to a head when United famously won the Champions League with two goals in injury time which saw them complete a magnificent treble of trophies that year.Ferguson's ruthless approach to management is exemplified in the story of how he dropped his first choice but out-of-form goalkeeper Jim Leighton for an FA Cup Final replay which cost him the player's respect and friendship even if it seemed vindicated by the team winning on the day.I'd have preferred a bit more shading introduced to the story with some insight into how he fell out with star players like David Beckham, Ruud Van Nistelroy and especially the team's great captain Roy Keane, his rivalries with managers like Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho as well as his regular run-ins with the governing authorities.Nevertheless, while undoubtedly a less than unbiased production, Ferguson's feats at both Aberdeen and Man United are certainly remarkable and will likely remain unsurpassed. A lifelong socialist (there's remarkable footage of an 18 year old Ferguson leading a strike march by Glasgow apprentices ship-workers in 1960) and with a work ethic inherited from his parents, the picture is painted of a sometimes despotic workaholic who nevertheless built his success at United by bringing on talented young players, particularly the celebrated ""Class of 92"" comprising the Neville Brothers, Beckham, Giggs, Scholes and Butt, who all became full internationals and household names.With a bit more objectivity and balance and a less rushed feel towards the end, this could have been a great sporting biography. Nevertheless, it was still an illuminating portrait of a fascinating man who while he may have proved difficult to like as a person, was certainly impossible to disregard in terms of his achievements in the game.",False
11,8,"Shock, another United documentary that ends at 1999",airbax1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Firstly, I genuinely really liked this documentary. It was so much better than The United Way which has come out around the same time.Not a United fan personally, but big fan of Sir Alex Ferguson. Very interesting to see about how he was brought up, early days as a player, manager of Aberdeen etc.What is annoying as a football fan watching these documentaries is that, for the most part, they all end after the 1999 champions league final. Save for about 5/6 minutes at the end.There's been tons of success in the following 20+ years, some great title & Cup wins including another UCL, still during the Ferguson years which could've been included.Still, SAF what a great manager & man.",False
12,10,G.O.A.T!,redkyng,n/a,16/08/2025,"I grow up as a United fan, watching Sir Alex Ferguson wining games, trophies, doubles and even trebles, since mid 90s i never supported a different club always believing in this Men, he's wining mentality isn't for his players only but for every United fan,we all standing up on the""Fergie Time"" believing that the goal is coming!. Unbelievable manager! Excellent documentary about the GOAT.",False
13,10,Absolutely fantastic documentary to watch,azzajack,n/a,16/08/2025,I can't praise this documentary enough to say how well done it is. The greatest manager to ever manage in English and Scottish football. I loved it and was close to tears because of being a football fan. We won't ever see a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson again. Just fantastic.,False
14,9,As good as Senna...,pali-282-38707,n/a,16/08/2025,"The best football documentary ever. Poignant, deep and stirring.In this day and age it is great to listen to stories of struggle and triumphs.My only regret is that it wasn't longer. I'd have loved to have heard more about how Sir Alex managed his life post 1999.",False
15,10,It is a must-watch for all.,trender-54448,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sir Alex Ferguson is not just the greatest football manager of all time, he is also one of the strongest and most determined people to grace the sport of football. What he achieved in his few years with Aberdeen and of course in his long tenure with Manchester United, will never be replicated. It is unlikely that we will ever see the likes of a Manager with his commitment and dedication to a football club ever again. He is truly an icon of the sport and this movie perfectly encapsulates what makes him great. It is a must-watch not only for Aberdeen and Manchester United fans, but for fans of football around the world.Thank you Sir Alex.",False

17,9,Any football fan with a soul will enjoy this,floridafart,n/a,16/08/2025,"Firstly, I'm an Arsenal fan so didn't like Ferguson (feared and respected him).But he is arguably the best manager in the history of modern club football. This documentary offers a rare insight into the man behind the legend. Determined, somewhat ruthless, highly intelligent and very charismatic.My only disappointment was that there weren't enough football clips as I'd have liked. Hence 9 stars rather than 10. This however is personal preference and nitpicking as this is an excellent documentary focussing on a true one off.It's brilliant and has a little bit of Cantona which is never a bad thing.Definitely worth a watch.",False

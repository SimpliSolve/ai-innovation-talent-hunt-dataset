1,8,The Volume,AvionPrince16,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPretty interesting to see the behind the scenes and im pretty impressed about the amount of work about the practical and the digital work. Its really impressive and even if im not a huge fan of sci fi genre i need to say that the show is immersive and have a nice ambience this is pretty clear. We have also see the problems of the show: the multinationalities, the technology, the set design. It was pretty interesting to see the technology they used: the volume. It remind me a lot of Mandalorian and how they use screen instead of green screen. That makes things more immersive for actors and for us. We see the difficulties with the pandemic and stuff. Andhi found the documentary awesome. To see all these people working together despite the differences. Pretty awesome and still impressed about their work even if i found the structure of The TV show pretty annoying but the documentary make us realise all the work and difficulties that maybe we are not aware and that was great to see how things work in the inside. Great documentary.",True
2,8,Nice insight. Shame no season two.,randomStuff101,n/a,16/08/2025,"They mention ""season 2"" a couple of times in casual conversation on set, before they knew Netflix would pull the plug. So they must have hoped it would happen, very sad it isn't.Great to see behind the scenes, all the details, costume making and hard work. They did create something very unique and cool, during a pandemic.You'd think with such production innovation and strong cast, Netflix would be keen to continue the adventure.Perhaps season 2 was pitched but they didn't like it. If the story became a futuristic ""space"" story, it would be completely different. The steamship was almost one of the characters, all those sets they built, wooden hallways and areas of the ship.I guess it's possible they simply didn't have a strong direction for the story to take after the true nature of the simulation is revealed.",False

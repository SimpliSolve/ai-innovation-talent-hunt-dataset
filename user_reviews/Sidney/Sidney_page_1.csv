1,9,Outstanding and so much more than you might think,Davalon-Davalon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLike many ""white people,"" I fell in love with Sidney. How could you not? He was extremely good-looking, a dazzling smile, a dynamic presence on the screen, and just explosive and surprising with every turn. Watching a film with him in his glory days was a thing of beauty.Oprah and her partners have brought together many people from Sidney's life, including his first wife, and all his children, and every seminal figure in his life, to talk about him. And perhaps most importantly, this was created when Sidney was still alive.It's very powerful and covers basically his whole life.The first part is a bit slow as Sidney himself goes into a lot of detail about his young life. But I understood why they kept it, because he was so shaped by the things his mother and father did for him and it kind of started him on his journey.Seeing this amazing man and all the lives he touched and the very powerful (and scary) eras he lived through is very moving. Revisiting some of his greatest roles brought tears to my eyes.And the guests! They had Lulu from ""To Sir With Love"" -- I mean, we're talking history! They had Katharine Houghton from ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" -- where there was a prominent interracial kiss featured. ""In the Heat of the Night"" where an obnoxious righteous white man slaps Sidney, and Sidney slaps him right back (I'm white, and it was such a rich, delicious, powerful moment).I think the reason I didn't give this a 10 is because of Oprah herself. I've noticed that when Oprah talks, everything is in superlatives and people and events ""changed"" her life ""forever."" All that may be true and I am sure she is being sincere about it, but if you hear it too often, it stops coming across as sincere, and even though she actually broke down and cried on camera at the end, I really hate to say this, because I'm sure it wasn't the case, but it came across as borderline fake. Then there is another moment when Sidney gives Oprah award, and at that moment, it's clear her tears are very real.Sidney was obviously an extremely important figure to the Black community, for a long list of reasons, and that is made crystal clear in this documentary. But at the same time, Sidney was important to the white community, and, for this white person, I'd say it's because it was thrilling to see this beautiful Black man on screen in commanding roles and doing an amazing role as an actor. I love actors and creative people and I really don't give a f-f what their race or sexuality is. As Barbra Streisand says (she's featured in about 3 clips), when you looked at Sidney, he looked like what a movie star is supposed to look like. I agree.A movie star is someone you cannot take your eyes off when they're on the screen; such was the case with Sidney Poitier.Again, the documentary covers a lot of territory and they did to a pretty good job of condensing his life to two hours. It is definitely worth the time, especially for people who remember his seminal roles.",True
2,7,No Conspiracy?,tchecks-45930,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, this is quite a good documentary. Not the greatest, but pretty good. A couple of complaints though. First off, there was too much Oprah Winfrey. I get that she was a producer, but she got too much screen time. Secondly, its pronounced pwa-tee-ay, not portier. If you are a lifelong fan of the great man, at least learn to pronounce his name, please.Finally, why no mention of The Wilby Conspiracy? This is one of Sidney Poitier's best movies, and right up there with In The Heat of the Night in terms of righteousness. He and Michael Caine had great chemistry and it was sad that this excellent performance was overlooked.",False
3,9,"Denzel Washington, Oprah Winfrey, Spike Lee and Quincy Jones pay a wonderful tribute to Sidney Poitier.",imseeg,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a man. What a heart. What a history.Sidney Poitier was THE FIRST black man to explore many new grounds that no black man had walked before him. THAT simple fact catapulted Poitier into the spotlight of millions of black and white people during the sixties.This exquisitedly made documentary (produced by long time friend and admirer Oprah Winfrey) focusses primarily on the roaring sixties, when alongside the rise of the civil movement his star rose to great heights on the silver screen.The one thing that was most astounding to me though, was the story of his early childhood. He grew up without knowing what electricity or running water was. Without ever having seen a mirror. Coming to America was a tsunami of impressions, which forever molded his beliefs and goals in life. And he did all that in honor of his mother and father.This is not some sentimental tearjerker story, no way, the guy really (and I mean really) HONORED his mother and father. As the youngest of the family he watched every move his parents made and how they interacted with others. His parents were his filmschool for life...Highly recommended for any Sidney Poitier fan!It is a nonstop, goosebump ride through the history of America and Sidney Poitier was the ever gentleman like and benevolent messenger, who all showed us what dignity and respect was. Besides being a marvellous actor!",False
4,10,Some kind of wonderful and extraordinary,spartanbuff,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary on Sidney Poitier is an absolute must-watch.He is near the top amongst my favorite actors and, for that matter, people; his book The Measure of a Man is required reading, because he reveals an extraordinary perspective on countless subjects gleaned from his life time of experiences.This documentary is jam-packed with appearances and testimonials from Mr. Poitier inspired and associated with: his family, co-stars, friends, and various luminaries.They all pour forth, with no small amount of affection, great love, and eloquence.All of the accolades and encomiums fully deserving.It is a fitting tribute to one of the greatest, most trail-blazing figures of our time.",False
5,10,What a Beautiful Life,KassyL,n/a,16/08/2025,"I gave this film a 10 not just because Sidney Poitier was such a powerful light in his life, but because of the wonderful storytelling of his life. I found myself smiling for most of the duration of the film. The images and commentary from the people who knew him best are extraordinary. The addition of some private home movies is an added plus. The film is an honorable memorial for an honorable man. Not sure this world will produce another like him. Thank you for telling his phenomenal story. We did not forget about him. I am inspired by his life and the film brought back memories of my childhood movie going experiences and how they made me fee. Awesome job.",False
6,6,Old fashioned documentary on a great subject,conradb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sidney Poitier was a great actor and a great man, so I was very much looking forward to this movie, especially given some very positive reviews.The documentary 'Sidney' is fascinating when Poitier is on screen, being interviewed for this project or in the extensive archive footage.However it is intensely irritating when some random celebrity comes on screen to tell us what we've just heard, or explain the obvious.I don't mind the views and anecdotes from his family or people who actually knew him, but there were too many unnecessary talking heads delivering exposition that had obviously been scripted by the production.",False
7,8,"An Inspiring Documentary That Will Ensure Future Generations To Love And Appreciate The Impact Of Oscar Award-Winning Actor, Mr. Sidney Poitier",rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sidney is an inspiring documentary that will ensure generations to come to love and appreciate the impact of Oscar award-winning actor, Mr. Sidney Poitier. The techniques used to tell his story, the events shared and the contributions to the film will keep viewers engaged. Described by producer Oprah Winfrey as one of the most extraordinary people she's ever met, Mr. Poitier would be proud of this documentary about his life.Sidney reflects on the life and legacy of iconic actor, filmmaker, and activist, Sidney Poitier. Born and raised in the Bahamas, the film shows life for him once he arrived in the USA as a colored man and how he rose to become an icon and the first Black actor to win the Academy Award for Best Actor, despite racism and other obstacles. The documentary creatively tells Poitier's story in his own words from interviews from Ms. Winfrey's personal collection. Anecdotes from his family and heavy hitters such as Denzel Washington, Spike Lee, Halle Berry, and Oprah Winfrey herself included.This film is truly a celebration of Mr. Poitier's legacy, the contributions he made, and a life well-lived. I love how the interview clips from the younger Poitier seamlessly blend together with the elder Poitier picking up the story. My favorite part of the documentary is the clip from Guess Who's Coming to Dinner when he says, ""You think of yourself as a colored man. And I think of myself as a man,"" because it perfectly summarizes how he felt about himself and how he demanded other people to look at him. For me, this is what enabled him to break so many barriers and pave the way for other actors, including myself. The film does not hold back and includes some of Mr. Poitier's not-so-proud moments, which really help show the different sides of his complex life.This film is about perseverance and being confident in who you are despite how the world sees you. I love that Mr. Poitier understood that he was not identified by his color and made sure everyone else knew it too, on and off-screen, even demanding scripts be rewritten to make his character stronger.I rate Sidney 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. You can watch Sidney on Apple TV+ starting September 23, 2022. By Tiana S., KIDS FIRST!",False
8,6,Sidney,henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Follows the life and achievements of Poitier, from growing up in The Bahamas without water or power, through his move to the States, where he finds his colour presents disadvantages and dangers. It then moves to his early acting career through theatre and onto film, particularly in the fifties and sixties and then to a time directing and his wider importance and influence in the World.Three things stick out in this well made, linear birth to death documentary. Firstly, it serves as a reminder of how appallingly people of colour were treated in the forties and fifties in the US and how much had to be endured and indeed how much danger Poitier was frequently in. This section provides perhaps the most personal elements, with Poitier speaking direct to camera, really quite movingly. Secondly, how much of a man of principles he was, only taking films and adjusting some scenes, that reflect the principles his parents had taught him - although in fairness, and well done to the makers for including it, it does highlight his playing away from home with Diahann Carroll. Finally and most importantly, as evidenced by the esteem he is clearly held in by a top list of celebrity talking heads here, he clearly is regarded with genuine awe by so many for what he has done for civil rights in film and more widely. Well worth catching - a nice guy.",False
9,8,Complimentary Tribute That Borders Between Penetrating Portrait and Deification,EUyeshima,n/a,16/08/2025,"For those of us who have admired Sidney Poitier for decades, this reverential 2022 documentary will satisfy the desire for a respectful tribute to a genuinely impressive man who left a lasting legacy. Directed by Reginald Hudlin and produced by Oprah Winfrey (who is truly overwhelmed by her subject), the film benefits from Poitier's first-person narrative recorded some time before his death earlier this year. His recounting of his impoverished childhood in the Bahamas and Florida is moving. Then the parade of his classic films follows with the focus on aspects and themes that are quite familiar to us by now. The interviews with his children and especially his first wife Juanita are particularly revelatory. Their words resonate in bringing him to life with minimal blemishes.",False
10,7,Solid Introduction to an Acting and Cultural Legend,KinoBuff2021,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Sidney"" (2022) is a very solid documentary covering the life of the Black Bahamian/American actor, director, politician, and father-figure, Sidney Poitier. The film serves as a great introduction to the legendary figure.Presented as a typical biographical documentary. This film covers Poitier's life and legacy through interviews from his early career up to his final years. Poitier's personal intentions and beliefs are more thoroughly explained by him and popular culture figures like Oprah Winfrey (who is a producer for this film).The documentary is not groundbreaking by any means and can seem a little dull despite covering the life of one of the most important and interesting cultural figures in history.In truth, the life of Sir Sidney Poitier deserves a more in-depth look with a docuseries, but this film remains a very good introduction to his life. Poitier's legacy as a Black actor, leader, and father-figure broke down color-barriers and paved the way for all persons of color to break free from type-cast roles and pursue their own artistic control.Watch this film even if you have never seen one of Poitier's films as you will still be greatly inspired by this legendary figure.",False

Sidney Poitier was a very important actor but also a very important person the civil rights movement. Through his amazing career, Sidney Poitier directed and produced some very successful movies, something difficult but an important milestone for him. To sum up, I have to say that ""Sidney"" is an amazing documentary from which I learnt a lot for Sidney Poitier and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that the life and the achievements of Sidney Poitier will amaze you, too.",False
12,10,A befitting tribute to a man who exuded excellence,mandelaalum,n/a,16/08/2025,"I call this documentary a befitting tribute to a man who has paved the way for a number of black actors that exist in Hollywood today. This is not to say that the work has not finished. A lot still needs to be done in so far as black representation in Hollywood. Other than that, I can say that as someone who lives in the 21st century, we are certainly on the right track. There is no doubt that Mr. Poitier's road to becoming the success that he would eventually become was a long and lonely one, but it was worth it. The world would not have known the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Denzel Washington and many others had this man not existed.",False
13,8,Main Figure,jokinoc-59294,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary about the life of actor and director of theater and cinema Sidney Poitier.The film captures every event from the actor's biography, starting from how he was born in the Bahamas in 1927 and ending with what influence he left behind for most people.His films had a tremendous impact because they destroyed the barriers between blacks and whites, as well as gave a new breath to the black population, which later resulted in Blaxploitation, where Sidney himself no longer had much fame, but as the ancestor was a big figure.In addition to his illustrious career in cinema, with the help of which he got into the first ranks of American bohemia, Sidney also conducted political activities defending the rights of blacks in North America.And, of course, the film does not bypass the off-screen life of the actor, revealing him from the unpleasant side, unfortunately not as much as we would like.And everything is backed up by comments from leading figures in the media industry from Oprah to Spike Lee, including Sidney himself, who was filmed for the film, although it is clear that he plays a role in talking about himself.",False

His struggles as an individual before becoming a movie star.

15,10,A true Hero on the screen and loved,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Produced by Oprah Winfrey and directed by Reginald Hudlin, the nearly two-hour film delves deep into the Hollywood icon's psyche and is an endearing biopic that tells us so much about his struggles to get to where he did. Poitier died in early 2022, but the film features a telling interview with the star, who speaks about learning humility and empathy from his parents, and also shares the traumatic story of his birth. He was in his 90s when he died, but he was not supposed to live so long. Born two months premature to tomato farming parents on Cat Island in the Bahamas in the 1920s, his father had brought a shoebox to serve as a makeshift coffin. But his mother would have none of it - she walked around the island weeping when she chanced upon a soothsayer, who predicted that the child would go places and reach the pinnacle of glory. ""I achieved most of it,"" Poitier tells us in the documentary, which has been narrated in the form of a lilting story. Although much of the biography comes from the man himself, there are invaluable inputs from Winfrey, Halle Berry and Morgan Freeman, who says at one point that Sidney never played a subservient part - something so common in Hollywood before race relations became a huge debate in the 1960s. Earlier, What viewers will undoubtedly take away is a picture of a man who paved the way for actors of color to shine on the big screen and emerge from the shadows of their white contemporaries. Black actors could only be janitors or dishwashers or nannies on the silver screen, but Poitier changed all this. His 1963 film ""Lilies of Field"" earned him an Oscar and he became the first Black person to win an Academy Award for Best Actor.

What caused even more of a stir was 1967 film ""In the Heat of the Night"" in which Poitier's Detective Virgil Tibbs slapped an actor playing a white plantation owner on screen. It was electrifying, especially given the ongoing civil rights movement.The biopic dives into all this and more, but does not shy away from the actor's failings in his personal life - his long affair with actress Diahann Carroll triggered a divorce which split his family, for example.",False
16,10,UNPARALLELED EXCELLENCE...!,masonfisk,n/a,16/08/2025,"A recent Apple + documentary on the seminal African American actor Sidney Poitier. Tracing his roots from the Caribbean to his sojourn to America where he found himself as an actor in a Black Dramatic troupe & developing a rivalry w/up & comer Harry Belafonte, both actors would invariably be up for the same roles w/Poitier luckily besting him in some key parts namely 1958's The Defiant Ones. Once he won the coveted Best Actor Oscar for 1963's Lilies in the Field, his standing as an actor vaulted him into the stratosphere making him more than just a black actor but an actor whose race would be the onus for all of those who would follow. Late interviews w/Poitier detail his standing as an actor (which in the 70's he would parlay into a career as a successful director w/1980's Stir Crazy, the biggest financial success for a black director up to that point) & as a family man where his first marriage floundered after he had an affair w/Diahann Carroll & then later to his last wife, Joanna Shimkus, a white woman. Luckily most audiences saw him return to acting in a handful of films in the 80's & 90's (Little Nikita, Sneakers, The Jackal) to see what everyone else knew when he first hit the scene.",False

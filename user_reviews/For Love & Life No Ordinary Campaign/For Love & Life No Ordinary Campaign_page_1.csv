1,8,"Inspiring To See Barack Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, Priscilla Chan And Others Support Their Campaign",rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had a pleasant time viewing For Love & Life: No Ordinary Campaign. The mood, editing, and celebrity cameos make this an excellent watch overall.This documentary follows Brian Wallach & Sandra Abrevaya, a couple from Chicago, who meet and fall in love while working during Obama's 2008 campaign. Shortly after starting their family; news of Brian's ALS diagnosis turned this family's world upside down. However, Brian and Sandra were not going to let ALS stand in their way. This film follows the mass ALS movement sparked by Brian and Sandra, and how this couple's journey gave a voice to the millions of people suffering with the disease and how they also brought attention to the US's broken healthcare system.I love the uplifting mood this documentary takes - the music and editing perfectly captivate the success and struggles that both Brain and Sandra faced while fighting for ALS. One scene that really stuck with me is when Brian and Sandra were preparing a speech that they were going to give to the government urging them to make the drugs that could help the symptoms associated with ALS accessible for all. The music by Emily Rice really adds in creating a suspenseful, yet captivating moment. As for the editing, supervising editor Miranda Yousef makes us feel immersed in this film with its very smooth transitions, transitions between interviews, personal video recordings, and animated info graphics. Lastly, I was very pleased to see celebrities such as Barack Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, Priscilla Chan, and countless others share their positive encounters with Brain and Sandra and the different ways in which they all support their campaign.The film's message is that when you encounter a problem, no matter how hopeless you may feel, there is always a solution that can often end up helping others along the way. This message is explored throughout the film and, even when discussing their trials and tribulations, this messaging remains true. The only thing to note is that there are some cuss words that are used.I give For Love & Life: No Ordinary Campaign 4 out of 5 starts and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. The film releases on Prime Video on May 28, 2024. If you're looking for a new documentary to watch I definitely recommend you check this one out! By Tia O., KIDS FIRST!",False
2,9,ALS finds its voice,shauntaylor17-427-42778,n/a,16/08/2025,"For those who keep up with Brian and Sandra on X.com, the platform previously known as Twitter, their deep involvement in the ALS community is no secret. It seemed destined that they would channel their passion into a documentary that chronicles their personal journey-a project that likely wasn't envisioned from the start.The film is a poignant exploration of resilience, celebrating triumphs amidst the family's own struggles with adversity.Packing a powerful punch, the documentary resonates on an emotional and intellectual level, serving as an enlightening resource for anyone eager to understand the ongoing battle against a disease that is, as of now, incurable.For a deeper understanding of ALS, also known as motor neuron disease or Lou Gehrig's disease, this film is a must-watch this evening.",False
3,8,Blows my mind that no-one mentions Lyme in this doc,sildjanika,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very touching documentary, but as chronic neuro-Lyme sufferer who experienced ALS-, MS-, Parkinson-like (all clinical diagnosis w unknown cause) symptoms with 4 different tickborne infections (real diseases aka bacterial infections) it blows my mind that millions are spent on research that goes nowhere and the most probable cause (tickborne infections disseminated into central nervous system) is not explored, is still a taboo. How many hundreds thousands have to die before this possibility is even explored??? The only exception are great dr V. Tedone, dr S. Phillips and dr. A. Miller.Please please spend millions researching and finding a cure for Lyme and Co, the most probable cause for neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders.",False

1,2,lazy pile of stock footage and boring commentary,johannes-94,n/a,16/08/2025,"With totally random footage of flying stars and planets, seemingly unrelated to the text and endlessly looping, this rehearsal of old news grew tiresome very fast, and I quit when some self-proclaimed 'expert' started talking about the ""jack webb"" space telescope (referring to the James Webb space telescope). The audio quality of the interviews is also terrible. The background noise is sharply cut off after every interview, and the supposedly 'epic' music is just washed over everything non-stop. All in all, an amateuristic, un-original, un-surprising, totally irrelevant and lazily made non-documentary, totally unworthy of Netflix.",False

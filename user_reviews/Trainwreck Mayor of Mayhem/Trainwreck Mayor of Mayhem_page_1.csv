1,6,Interesting but doesn't feel quite complete.,medoalgana,n/a,16/08/2025,"This Trainwreck documentary does a very wonderful job of showcasing the struggles that Robert Ford had to go through in order to confront the scandalous situations he found himself caught in.But frankly, I feel like it should have taken more time to talk about his policies and his ACTUAL work as a politician since he is a politician at the end of the day. We only got to see a glimpse of that here.Maybe another area the documentary could have tackled on was how these compromising videos were caught on camera in the first place. It happened too many times, there has got to be a reason of some sort, was it perhaps because he had bad friends or something like that? This movie certainly won't give you the answer.",False
2,7,"Criticism heavy, where's the positives?",bhttacharjee-saurav,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a Vancouverite and I wasn't Canadian when Rob Ford was mayor of Toronto. But i remember reading about it all on international media.This documentary is engaging and keeps you glued with quick pivots. The biggest criticism i have is it was negative-heavy. Why weren't his policy decisions mentioned at all? Why not show his good work as legacy, and not just his public connect? Why was the documentary so 'sudden-event-based' and not informative? Is the underlying message that a person who consumes drugs is still worthless? Given the loose mention of smoking weed in the documentary, that's not true at all. The premise that a man's private life is made a spectacle by the media should be a negative on the media and not the man himself.Funny how the media escapes criticism and pretends they're just messengers.",False
3,7,VIEWS ON FILM review of Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerRob Ford was the mayor of Toronto, Canada from 2010 to 2014. He died two years after his term so in 2025's Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem, he's obviously not around to defend his controversial self. Oh well, what are you gonna do?""Mayhem"", yeah it's an effective, sort of transitory documentary, edited lightning quick and almost in a rush to round off, as its 49 minutes could've easily been stretched out to 75-plus. Its title has the word ""trainwreck"" but could also be associated with the words ""car accident"". Hey, you can't look away from the aspect of contentiousness.So yeah, Ford got caught doing drugs on camera, he was an alcoholic, and was accused of giving oral you-know-what to some unknown hooker. But hey, the public kind of dug him and he might've gotten a second shot as ""Hogtown's"" most powerful politician had he not fallen to a grave illness.Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem, well it basically talks about Rob Ford in the 3rd person, using archives and accounts from 10-15 years ago plus present-day interviews from the denizens that knew him best. Ford, yup he was the P. T. Barnum of elected heads, a real entertaining pill of a human being. He made defamed Governor Rod Blagojevich look like Romper Room by comparison and made Marion Barry seem rather choir boyish as quiet as it's kept. ""He turned City Hall into a circus"". Uh, fo sho. Fo sho fo sho.Now do I plan on recommending ""Mayhem?"" I have to. I mean it's so well done and brisk, a mere snapshot of a transmission that PBS might've salivated over had they got the almighty rights. And do I think Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem is a perfect way to hark back to what made Ford such a kooky stitch, giving the media the business like a rollicking oaf on hallucinogens? Not quite. The flick feels a little dated and it's so brief it might just float away after one viewing. ""Train"" fair.",True
4,4,"I met Rob at Mt Sinai hospital, he was just human",Z-al,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was at my Sinai hospital one day when I ran into Rob and his bodyguard. He sounded like you're really nice guy, and we both ended up striking the conversation about health and football. He did not know at the time what was wrong with him and I did not know anbput my health situation either, in the end we both ended up with a serious illness. At that moment he trusted me like a friend even though I had just met him.Unfortunately he didn't survive while I did and I feel so sorry for him. Despite his faults i could see the fear of unknown in his eyes that day. Before he got diagnosed he did clean up his act and he did try to get better and I'm so glad he died knowing he tried his best. This documentary was very unfair and everything that is wrong with this world. In the end he was a victim of drugs, politics and disease. Something which many of us fall victim to as well and have very little chance of surviving at times . Victim blaming never solves anything.",False
5,9,Rehashes the scandal but shows the human,RandyM-279,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, it showes a lot of the scandal and negative. However, don't just look at the surface, but dig deep and think about it: Ford was a very dedicated human being, who truly cared about people in his city, and like all people he had his struggles. Faced with challenges and scandals he really did the best he could in a very demanding role under very challenging circumstances. I always admired Ford for his brash and off-the-wall style, and I think this reaffirmed for me how people like to stigmatize people with mental health and substance use challenges. But often we are too quick to judge without looking at ourselves and realizing our humanity.",False
6,1,The best mayor,aplut-47351,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary felt more like a smear campaign than anything else. From the very beginning, it didn't feel like they were trying to tell a fair or balanced story. It seemed like they were just digging up old drama to stir things up and get people watching. There were no real interviews with people on the street, no real voices from regular Torontonians who loved the guy or supported him through everything. That alone says a lot. If they had talked to people who actually lived in the city and saw what he did day-to-day, the story would've looked a lot different. But they clearly didn't care about that. They had a certain angle they wanted to push, and they stuck to it, no matter how one-sided it ended up looking.They should have let the poor guy rest in peace. He's not even around anymore to speak for himself or defend anything. It just felt wrong to dig it all up again like this, especially without giving equal time to the good parts of what he did.",True
7,8,More Sad than Bad....,EleanorRigby-2020,n/a,16/08/2025,"Poor Rob wanted to impress his Dad. Sound familiar? That is not the only glaring point that rang true for his values as well as the fool in DC right now. Except for the substance abuse which, of course, the king down south is famous for being clean and dry, their approaches to politics and fame were/are quite identical. I kept looking at poor Doug's face as he accompanied his brother at the podium many times, looking at him through the lens of revisionist history, what he was thinking we will never know. Rob resembled Chris Farley at his SNL-craziest. I did not necessarily learn a lot watching this doc, but I was shocked at how his enablers let so much go, right to the end. RIP.",False
8,1,"Rob's struggles, life and achievements is undeserving of the title",ndostic-26662,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rob's life story, encompassing his struggles, achievements, and personal battles, truly deserves more recognition and respect than the title of this documentary suggests. Unfortunately, the film falls short, presenting a skewed narrative that appears to be driven by political motivations. This is reminiscent of how the media portrayed Rob during his lifetime, often focusing on sensationalism rather than a balanced representation of his character and contributions. It's disheartening to see such a powerful narrative undermined by a lack of objectivity and depth. A proper biography with human side of good, bad and ugly would have been a better fit.",False
9,1,Add for patriarchal politics - no thanks!,kontoudakis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Trying to portray a reckless and egotistic privileged white cis-man, as a ""people´s person"" - especially in times like these, where this kind of dudes have brought us to the brink of WW III/selfextinction - is just cynical and harmful. The people of this production company should ask themselves if the money they got out of this, is worth to push further in destroying democratic values and structures. He was unfit to be a ""public servant""/politician from the very begining and the only reason he even got this far, is that enough people/dudes are still profiting from this capitalist-patriarchal system.Every person has their ""good sides"" and/or their loved ones, that will speak fond of them. This doesn´t make up for harmful, discriminative behavour, for nepotism, for dishonesty, for corruption and many other things when it comes to politics or any other position of responsibility. ""Oh, he couldn´t even care for himself, but he was a fun guy with daddy-issues (and addiction-problems), so he must have been able to handle a high political position - infact he was the best choice for it. Because he was a ""'fighter"" and a people´s person."" this is what this ""documentary"" tries to sell and I´m not buying it.",False
10,8,A Real Life Tragedy,GregDowner,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was no fan of Rob as our Mayor. It was a circus our city did not deserve. But watching this documentary allowed me to see the human side of him and the tragedy that it was. Many of us are like Rob. Survivors of childhood trauma. This is the example of what happens if you don't deal with it. I feel sad for him that he had to live it out so publicly. May he rest in peace. I heard Doug say he had no intentions of watching this, but I think he should. I think this was done very fairly and balanced. And may anybody who's walking in similar footsteps to Rob Ford find a pathway to healing and treatment they so deserve.",False
11,2,Why did I watch this?,maybeahottake,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI came into this documentary as an outsider to Canada and interested about this Rob Ford character. I was truly interested about learning about this man considering it's *all *about *him. Here's what I learned:Rob Ford was an independent/conservative politician.Rob Ford had a drug habit.Thats it...Within the hour, I thought I would have learned a lot more but clearly not. It almost seemed like they tried to make this drug habit a lot more serious than it actually is. Of course - it's bad to take illegal drugs - especially as a career politician, but media and this documentary really escalated the situation.Just like any legacy media these days.I would love to watch another film or read a report on what policies he did that were good or bad. Something this documentary seemed to forgot. It's not like it was his JOB or anything. Almost seems disrespectful to make a half-ass political hit piece on someone who's dead.Thank you for making a film on the man, but definitely wasted my time.",True
12,5,"Didnt need this, but was okay.",UltraNeptuneCat,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think this could of been a bit more condensed, slightly dragged on near the end, I mean there was the sneak peek at the begining that this was going to be a drug problem based documentry and that was his major secret. I read some other reviews that were 1 star about how documenting about someone drug problem is not entertainment and I can agree with that. I am glad he got help, and I dont know quite what he did, politically that was bad just that his drug and drinking problem was not good and it may of not been good entering a party for the military drugged up. At least he ended up getting help and focused on himself. I like the way he campaigned for the people, helping everyone with any problem that is a good basis.I like how they related his media criminalizing tactic like Donald Trum.p at some points.",False
13,8,Cannot Help Themselves,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"Legacy media is all the same, no matter the country. All over the world, if someone is upsetting the natural order, they must be destroyed at all costs.There is a reason Gawker is now defunct- and while I wouldn't necessarily qualify them as legacy media, they are part of the larger issue. If you want to see where the rot is, pull back the layers to see what that will expose. As the saying goes, 'The best disinfectant is sunlight.'
Rob Ford wasn't necessarily a beacon of goodness, but I wouldn't challenge anyone to find a single person who is above the slightest reproach- he had flaws but he got work done and his constituency adored him because he did the work everyone else made excuses for not doing.This feels like they are still angry and bitter over his ability to finesse and avoid the nonsense, until it became so relentless there was no other choice. It's ironic that the media talking head makes the Trump comparison- because it was blatantly obvious, even back then. The media are who they are, and now more than ever they've finally been exposed to sunlight and very few even give them a sideways glance.It couldn't happen to a better example of narcissistic, megalomaniac elites- they wrote their own downfall.",False
14,8,Mayor of Mayhem,IceCream-57,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this film. I was not sure if I would but I thought this was a good documentary. If you don't know who Bob Ford is this film gives you a quick overview of his political career. Maybe even too quick, as the film is only about 45 minutes. He's what I will say from the outside looking in, and again, this is only my opinion no fact her, it seem like he had a very strong personality and when he put his mind to getting something done it got done. Which is what I believe his fans loved about him. What his enemies didn't love was the fact that he was changing things in his local government from how things have always been. Regardless his life was cut tragically short. However, you cant be caught on tape breaking the law and you are in government. This film is good to watch if you don't know the history.",False

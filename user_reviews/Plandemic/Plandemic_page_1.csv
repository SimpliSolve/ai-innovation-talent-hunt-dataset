1,10,Superb expose,jonathanpmetcalfe,n/a,16/08/2025,Just finished watching this documentary and found it an excellent piece of film-making. it made me thankful to have seen it but also very angry. You don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to see that there is rampant corruption and lies at the very heart of the WHO and the CDC who are totally inside the pocket of the pharmaceutical companies.This film gives you the facts to combat the well-funded propaganda machine that saturates the internet and determines how our health care and medical industry operates.Well done to all those who worked so hard to bring this documentary to our screens and against all the odds. It was well worth it!,False
2,10,Focusing on following the money,EvanW219,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's hard to throw any derogatory labels at a piece like this when exact references, studies and documents are continuously introduced to back up what so many have been trying to censor. Mikki is selfless for dedicating his time to this.",False
3,1,Just a bunch of conspiracy nonsense with absolutely no proof,mcseca-96652,n/a,16/08/2025,Made for the tinfoil hat QAnon crowd. So many holes in this garbage its more a comedy for anyone to actually believe this.,False
4,9,Watch it! And decide for yourself!,chadgertler,n/a,16/08/2025,"UPDATED: Just wanted to add here on June 2022 that I truly believe that the first movie in this series will be historical! Unless we wake up and don't allow a country like 1984(book, movie), this movie will be in all history books as a part of the great awakening...a truly historic documentary! I believe the second one is even better and I can't wait to see the 3rd one! Everyone should see these and think for themselves!ORIGINAL: I've met a lot of weird people with some pretty wild conspiracy theories. People that actually scared me. So I'm a bit leery, open minded yet reserved when it comes to this stuff.But when questioning my doctor about the virus at an appointment this last summer as the coronavirus raged on he indicated to me some discomfort with the origin of it, some of the figures coming out, and the future vaccine. Being he was indecisive I asked him as he walked out the door specifically about taking the vaccine. He only responded, ""Over my dead body""! Concerned by his comment I came home to research it and found these Plandemic videos.I believe in practicing the scriptures when it says the test everything. You can't test something without opening your mind to think about it honestly first. You may be aware that everyone including Facebook, YouTube, etc immediately banned these videos. Yet you can find hundreds of videos talking about the misinformation and danger of this video. Everything I could look up on the internet was unequivocally negative about this pandemic video. Every single news source and even Wikipedia denounced it. Every headline is using words such as misinformation, debunked, and discredited. Even more alarming was that their own site where I first saw the video later was hacked and was peppered with articles and videos about how dangerous this Plandemic documentary is. It's strange and frightening that a video questioning such things would immediately be shredded to pieces like this. Can someone not even ask a question and question authority anymore?These videos both part 1 and part 2 may be hard to come by but well worth the search. They are well-made, progress smoothly and overall are entertaining if nothing else. But they did stir me to think which made it that much more enjoyable. Although I may not agree with everything I saw and heard, one thing was for sure, they are more factual and honest then the opposition! Highly recommend!",False
5,1,"The Poster Child for Failing the ""Test of Time""",cineworks-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"When Plandemic debuted in early in 2020, the theories and ""facts"" put forth in this film were shocking, provocative and maybe even believable. So it's understandable that so many people rated it 10/10, purely for the content.But watching Plandemic a year later, after so many people have died from Covid-19, feels more like watching ""Triumph of the Will"", after Jesse Owens dominated the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.Like Triumph, Plandemic put forth a dangerous proposition that's subsequently proven false.Unlike Triumph, this video foregoes any artistic asperations and goes pure ""talking heads.""Still, Plandemic seems to have been successful in convincing a number of people that Covid-19 was a hoax; face masks don't help; Hydroxychloroquine works; and that vaccines are a scam.And you have to wonder, how many people died because they, or someone they knew, believed the drivel spewed in plandemic?Final Note: I have to Apologize for comparing the work of Mikki Willis with that of Leni Riefenstahl. She deserves better.And speaking of conspiracy theories, notice that user reviews awarding Plandemic, a 9 or 10, all get tons of ""Helpful"" ratings. Seems suspicious to me...",False
6,10,This film peeks behind the wizard's curtain to reveal all,courtney-482-997407,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very well done and fascinating film that exposes the secret machinations that led to the lockdown of entire countries, leading to economic meltdowns and rising suicide rates, starvation, bankruptcies and a big windfall of profits for the pharmaceutical industry. Watch it and share, the truth needs to be seen to set us free from the lies that keep us locked in fear and isolation..",False
7,1,A load of Conspiracy theories and false information,cristina-ro,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was sceptical right from the beginning about this, I didn't make it past 30 min of this with a lot of fast forwarding. This documentary is a joke and is filled with conspiracy theories, they are going on many non-related tangents and giving a lot of unrelated and false information. I learned absolutely nothing, I just got angry that this load of junk is out there and I can't believe people rate this 10/10. See John Oliver's segment about coronavirus conspiracy theories you will be much better off and have a good laugh.",False
8,10,"Interesting, revealing and uplifting",fredrikwidmark,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary reveals critical information for understanding how easy it has become for big powerful companies to take control over all parts of our life. It makes deep and interesting dives into how different areas of our connected world plays different parts, and how the recent pandemic situation fits perfectly with everything else. You should not miss this great and important film, and it must of course be seen in its entirety, and preferably be discussed with others afterwards.",False
9,2,Tinfoil Hat Tour de Force,RmatthewC,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most of the premises in Plandemic were difficult to swallow in the first half of 2020. It hasn't aged well since.My inclination was to give this a single star due to the propensity of its ideas to kill people. Since it is smartly done murder, I upped to two stars.",False
10,10,Take A Stand,joan-44488,n/a,16/08/2025,"Now that this critical information is known to everyone, do your part and stand up for America! Spread the truth to everyone you come in contact with. Help the brave patriot whistle blowers who brought this dark information into the light. Get angry and demand justice!",False
11,10,Our Lives in 2020 exposed. How we got here into the mess and who worked very hard to put us there.,lizadair,n/a,16/08/2025,"For most people life as we know it has been upended. But why and what has been going on and who is behind it and how do we start to set ourselves and all people of good intent free.
Deep questions.
On a physical and metaphysical level we are at a turning point.
Each sovereign soul needs to come home to their heart and from there the corrections and the healing can begin.
Plandemic pulls back the curtain.
Time for truth and light to take center stage.",False
12,10,Excellent documentary,tdknl,n/a,16/08/2025,"A must see for anyone caring about people and this planet. While votes seem to imply that this is a bad movie, the opposite is true. A well documented explanation of the true mechanics behind the promoted narrative being sold to the world.",False
13,9,Sobering,stephen-93875,n/a,16/08/2025,"I now know how Neo felt in The Matrix when Morpheus broke the news about the world Neo had been living in. While I consider myself well informed, much of what is revealed in this documentary bordered on unbelievable to me. Unbelievable until the evidence presented made it all too believable.Plandemic exposes what's been going on behind the scenes with the drug companies, the CDC, mainstream media and Bill Gates. Many sites have debunked the documentary but when you see and hear Bill Gates admit that investing in vaccines was the best investment he ever made turning $10 billion into $200 billion, his stating that everyone on the planet needs to be vaccinated is anything but a humanitarian gesture. This is but one example of how things are not what they seem.",False
14,9,for seekers only,crokeefe,n/a,16/08/2025,"You'll understand this documentary, if you are one. I believe it's always best having access to both sides of an issue, especially when whistle blowers from the actual scientific community are censored and their lives and careers ruined from it. This is the side of science, the studies and how the data is squished up into whatever shape fits the mainstream narrative.",False
15,10,Oustanding,attilamaradi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Superb documentary with the best and brightest. Judy Mikovits is a sound, well articulated and honest voice expressing her claims with sound explanations and scientific facts. Even though forces in motion tried to discredit her scientific integrity and debunk the evidences presented, it is obvious to any knowledgable and unbiased audience that what is presented in the movie is valid. The second movie Plandemic Indoctrination backed up with numerous peer reviewed publications and by the outstanding research of the maker and Dr. David E. Martin is equally superb. Thanks for putting them out there!",False

18,n/a,Shining light,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"An excellent documentary showing how 'following the money' uncovers the real motives behind 'healthcare' - namely Profit. If you think Pharma and modern medicine has your (our, us the people) health first, this will show you the truth and provide areas for further exploration. Exposing corruption in areas I wasn't aware of. Well worth the watch, and check the links on their website to dig further.",False
19,10,Fantastic,issue40,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a truly incredible documentary that exposes the corruption in big pharma and politics. The fact that the Left hates this so much should tell you all you need to know. This is truly an important work and it needs to be shared far and wide. Watch with your friends and family and get educated.,False
20,10,A must see!,ehret-51007,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary was a real eye opener... I stumbled upon it online recently and am very glad I did. The public has a right to know these things,False

22,10,Eye opener!,dgbq,n/a,16/08/2025,"It gives me chills watching this beautifully documented film because of how detailed the doctors/scientists are exploiting the sick & corrupt that have had government involvement for years. Thank you to the brave that have been interviewed & to the producer, thank you! I recommend it to everyone!",False
23,10,Best motion picture of 2020,vanladas,n/a,16/08/2025,I highly recommend this to anyone seeking the truth of what's happening right now in the world. Thank you for sharing this information!,False
24,10,A must-see movie,movieviewersd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even if you want to write everything off as a conspiracy theory, you owe yourself to watch this movie and get another perspective. Well researched and the facts are there for anyone who wants to look at them.",False

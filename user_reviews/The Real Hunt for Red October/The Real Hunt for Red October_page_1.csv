1,6,A stretch...,stevebronco,n/a,16/08/2025,"This comparison of the movie to the actual story of the K129 (better told in ""Azorian: The Raising of the K-129 (2010)"") is fairly entertaining, and well-done with many interesting details about the film, the actors, the writer, the director, and the K-129. But it's long-winded at about 2 hours, and there's a very-obvious effort to make it all fit the narrative of another book with a wild theory about what K-129 might have been doing (not based in any facts offered in this film) when it sank. This story would have been better if that fantasy had been omitted, but it's still worth watching.",False
2,2,Rather silly,spuddcw2000-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIts a comical conspiracy yarn that fails on every front. Most egregious in it's hilariousness is the innuendo about Tom Clancy's house being between a naval base and the naval academy. It actually was between the two landmarks. Along with about 200,000 other houses and businesses. But somehow Clancy is painted as having special access to state secrets.... As if those who gave him the state secrets would be okay with him publishing it.The movie takes itself seriously which even makes the film some what more comic in its presentation. What is most hilarious is the portrayal of Tom Clancy sitting at his desk--dark shades on--pecking away on his type writer. You just have to laugh.",True

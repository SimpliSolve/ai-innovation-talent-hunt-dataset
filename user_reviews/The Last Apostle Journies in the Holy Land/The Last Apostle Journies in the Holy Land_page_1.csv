1,8,Enlightening,azgoldwing,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found the show to be pretty interesting. I've known that Paul's travels were within modern-day Turkey, but this show connected the dots very well. My one complaint is that he posits that the Apostle Paul may have obtained his Roman citizenship by having once been a slave. But in Act 22:28, Paul clearly states that he was born a Roman citizen. For him to claim to be a New Testament scholar and expert on Paul, I found this glaring mistake a disappointment.",False
2,10,Amazing documentary!,waynenalljr,n/a,15/08/2025,"I learned so much about the early journeys of Paul in this documentary. Follow along with a ""real life"" Indiana Jones named Mark Fairchild as he unearths antiquities from Paul's day and before. I had no idea of the riches that lay in Turkey that have yet t o be discovered. It is a veritable cornucopia of historical finds. On my bucket list!",False
3,3,Did not meet expectations,rsheldon-25104,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Last Apostle is routed as being about tracing the route of St. Paul, but it ends up more about Dr. Fairchild and Turkish culture. The film and sound quality feels very amateurish. I was expecting more but was disappointed.",False
4,5,Who are we actually learning about?,cwduchene,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is more about Mark Fairchild than St Paul. Very disappointed. May be a decent show about the history of Turkey...but actual information on Paul's travels is scant. Misleading title. One hour in and still haven't heard or seen anything that has taught me something about St Paul that I couldn't surmise myself. ""Paul could have walked these roads "", ""Paul may have visited these areas "" is what you get. Just learned that ""once clay is fired it doesn't go away""...ok, what does that have to do with Paul??? Then we get to learn Mark played tennis, and still does!! Wow, maybe the title should be Mark Fairchild's travels through Turkey. Gave up at the hour mark.",False

1,8,Its Only For Those With Universal Cosmos Minds!,silicontourist,n/a,15/08/2025,"If this type of subject -its literally the outer limits unlimited- is not for you its is going to be duh...boring for you! If, like me though, you are fascinated by the infinite goings on in our unexplored cosmos it will peak your interest. But I must say this was narrated in an almost bedtime put you to sleep style. Nothing arousing excitement pumped into it whatsoever!However I still enjoyed the subject matter which, even though I feel it is an awful lot of wasted study money needed elsewhere on Earth, revealed fascinating revelations, theories and possibilities. There are some wondrous images and exciting ideas but to be seriously honest, I don't think humans are -or ever will be- going to be ready for interstellar space travel. The only reason its being studied so fervently right now is for somewhere for the 1% super wealthy elite to escape to once they have done with destroying this planet of ours!Nice to view; very enjoyable!",False
2,5,confusing,starowarso,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary is not divided chronologically. They repeat several things and talk about a subject and only 10 minutes later they explain it further, everything is mixed up. They also use terms that as a viewer who provides little knowledge does not understand anything and they do not explain it. When they talk about the different planets they use the same picture which causes confusion.They use a certain font to make it look a bit futuristic and robotic but that font is just plain ugly. You cannot deduct points from the font.The shots during the interview are bad, when professors are talking their heads are half in the picture and zoomed in a lot.",False
3,2,Pretty...,Jaymz13,n/a,15/08/2025,"Terms such as ""might, possibly, and maybe"" have no business being used THIS much in a show that proclaims itself to be a scientific documentary. Of course, this show is pretty light on science. It's pretty light on documentation, too.What it's heavy on is unsubstantiated statements, hopeful thinking, and many statements about what some scientists WISH to be disvovered. Hardly a ""documentary,"" even by the loosest of definitions.I read a lot of science and science fiction. Of the two types of writing, this one falls much closer to the latter than the former. Hype. That's all this is. Hype for Keppler. They just spent 54 minutes basically declaring how great Keppler is. And it really is. But there's no need to create this whole Trojan horse of a ""documentary"" to convince me. Just document Keppler and the discoveries made because of it. Enough of this non-science, mumbo-jumbo, mushroom dreaming about what you HOPE to discover. Stick to what's actually been discovered. THAT'S what a documentary is.",False

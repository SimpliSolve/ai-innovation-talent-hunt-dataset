1,1,Complete waste of time,karlsi,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThey try and fail to record anything. Unless you enjoy watching these guys struggle and get no results, don't bother. Why this was packaged into a show is beyond me. Very repetitive and try to build suspense but no payoff.",True
2,1,What a waste of time,greatdainb,n/a,16/08/2025,"At the end of the show my elementary aged kids said ""so they've learned nothing?"" in frustration. They had already exclaimed that strapping bait fish to a fake dolphin, would only show you that a shark would bite a fake dolphin where the bait fish was and not if a shark would actually bite a dolphin.The voice over sounds imitating underwater communications were silly and the underwater conversations were poorly scripted and not believable. My kids were frustrated with how fake and unbelievable it was.We got to see some sharks and dolphins which was fun but there was nothing to learn here (other than how NOT to conduct studies/tests).",False

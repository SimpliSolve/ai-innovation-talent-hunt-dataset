1,9,"Great doc: funny, infuriating and well produced",jordanomiller,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film was screened on my college campus in mid May. I'd read the book and was curious how it would look in documentary form. The filmmakers did a good job in explaining the basic message but having actual students tell their personal stories is what makes the film especially interesting.The students who appear are incredibly articulate, perceptive and funny and do a great job of describing the abominations inflicted by current academia. The books authors--Lukianoff and Haidt-- also appear and explain further how identity politics have turned students into emotional basketcases.I highly recommend this movie.",False

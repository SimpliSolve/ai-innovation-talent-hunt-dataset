1,n/a,Would have liked a little more baseball,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI liked this movie but it spends more time on the political agenda of anti trump supporters than baseball. The story of a two nation baseball team is amazing and should be a movie by itself. Unfortunately this is two movies that are only slightly related. Either make a documentary on the wall or baseball. Doing both didn't work.It's almost like two directors both ran out of funding so decided to stick their movies together. The baseball story is fascinating to me and it's a shame that 75% of the film is about political unrest in Mexico and that idiot trump.I would have watched both movies but they don't work at the same time.,True
2,1,Political trash,jamespetenbrink,n/a,16/08/2025,I was interested in this because I thought it was a baseball documentary about a team in Mexico. It wasn't. It was anti Trump propaganda. The clip that had me turn it off was showing Trump saying some of the dangerous people who could illegally come into the country and they cut to mothers getting out of a van with their kids. Such trash. Not surprised the guy who made it used to work at VICE.,False
3,3,Dos y Tres Pa' Llevar,rozyber,n/a,16/08/2025,"Típico documental donde pueden darle el lujo de hablar mal de un país. Si se sientes tan inseguros no visiten esos lugares bien pueden hacer sus eventos en ciudades más seguras como Detroit, Chicago St. Louis. We don't really need your bad publicity. Primero aprendan y miren ""The Last Narc is a docuseries about the 1985 death of U.S. DEA agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena. The series interviews DEA agents and witnesses to Camarena's death who state that he was murdered by Mexican drug lords, with the complicity of the CIA"" Si existe toda esa violencia en México es por los millones que adictos en US. Si pueden detener (cigars) puros de Cuba porque no pueden detener las drogas. Gary Webb's ""Dark Alliance"" series boldly claimed the CIA knew about a U.S. drug trafficking scheme that ravaged the country's inner cities to fund Nicaragua's Contra rebels. Years later, he shot himself in the head. Y el payaso racita Ra y es una burla para el mundo f-him",False
4,n/a,"A glossy, yet missed opportunity. Watch something else.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was surprised to see Laredo, Texas and Los Tecolotes being presented on a Showtime documentary, and having lived there as a long term transplant, I was eager to learn something that maybe I had missed. Unfortunately, the director's sappy storyline depicted Laredo and Los Tecolotes' circumstances in a fashion that left an unpleasant aftertaste which smacked of a flaccid Vice network production. In short, don't waste your time with this rapidly dated piece of work.After reviewing the IMDB entry, I was not entirely surprised to discover the the producer/director, an Emmy award winning Andrew Glazer, was formerly a Vice network executive.",False
5,n/a,"""With US-Mexico relations reaching an historic low point,...""",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"That was the clue that this was an agenda driven, political message production.US/Mex relations are currently doing quite well, as a matter of fact.Too bad - it could have been an interesting documentary, but instead was very difficult to watch.",False

1,7,An Eye Opening Window Into The Afterlife Of Fame,fatfil-414-451797,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI found this absolutely fascinating. Tyson Fury is clearly a troubled man, but he is also a complete dick. His disconnection from his family is painful to watch. He flirts around the outskirts of family life, but as soon as fame and publicity beckons, he disappears to chase the fame. He goes on ridiculous adventures with his kids on school nights, leaving his wife to tidy up after him and then he's away. He comes home from a week away sucking up fame, then throws his jacket at his wife and goes to see his dog. He can make all the excuses he wants, but I have been through depression, and that is just being a dick. He says he wants to spend more time with his family, but I don't see it. He pays lip service to family life, but doesn't follow it through with his actions. I have no respect for him. He may be able to hit people hard, but relationship wise, nah.",True
2,6,It's a roller coaster of a ride,Shadwellarmy,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe show itself is ok and we're half way through watching the series. At times, it's a good insight into living with BiPolar for both the sufferer and the family. There are some real continuity issues that take away from the sense of this being real and in the moment. There's one scene where Tysons ice cream miraculously grows and then disappears showing that this was shot a few times to get the content. The Fury's themselves seem to be living in a world of contradiction. They claim to live like travellers and follow the traveller code and keep it grounded but then every item of clothing is designer, expensive and even the kids are wearing Rolex watches despite the claim from Paris that they aren't spoiling them. It's like they don't know how to accept who they are and what they've got for fear of losing touch with their roots. Tyson is the same. I drive a Passat, except for when I'm driving the Lambo or the Ferrari! And how did they not know that Molly Mae was pregnant at six months when the whole of instagram did? Clearly not close to his brother Tommy. I do have some sympathy for Tyson though, when he's getting filmed and photographed all the time by the people around and the guy who comments to him about AJ beating him when he's just chilling out on a bench shows how cruel people can be and rude. Interesting insight into their lives but I hope for their sake that they don't make another series.",True
3,8,Great fun.,kenbo-87360,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tyson Fury is as mad as a box of frogs. I find it impossible not to like the bloke. He knows what he is doing, he knows how to milk the brand and get the financial rewards. Acting the clown has only added to his bank balance.I thought he was a joke when he first burst onto the boxing scene. Big, gangly and full of s##t. Uncouth, loudmouth you name it. But he has stood the test of time and fought (and beat) the best of his generation. You can't ask any more than that.The programme was great viewing. A gypsy family living by their code, albeit in a sprawling mansion with a garage full of supercars! I suppose it's easy to say money isn't the most important thing to him when he has millions!This is harmless reality TV, made for us to enjoy. His wife Paris does a good job of trying to live a normalish life. She came across very well.",False
4,7,Unexpected!,hardestheartedharlot,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well, well well, this is a turn up for the books. This show is all heart, authenticity, family and a peek into living and loving someone with bipolar. I was shocked in places, the children's language, what a twelve year old girl is allowed to look like, but once I got past the end of my own nose I was more and more impressed by the family unit and how they keep it all together. The insight into bipolar is stellar. I do believe this show will remove a lot of the stigma surrounding men and mental health issues. None of it felt scripted or contrived, which is hard to come by these days. It's not something I ever thought I'd watch, but I'm glad I did. The show is not what I expected at all.",False
5,10,"Wonderful tale of fame, love, the gypsy life and bipolar",cdrbfcbm,n/a,16/08/2025,Tommy has had a bad press for his mood swings in the program by people who don't understand how overwhelming bipolar mood is. He clearly adores his wife Paris and the two of them are true family people with gypsy values shown at their best. Paris is not taken for a fool by him - she knows him in and out and calls him out when he is sexist . It is a mesmerising portrayal about fame and the obsessionality needed to succeed as a sportsman at the highest level. It is very funny and charming and a total binge watch. Recommended for anyone - I had never watched a boxing match before. And the kids are all an absolute charm.,False
6,10,What a watch ðŸ‘€,tracycopeland-00032,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm not a fan of boxing but I enjoyed this so much. I really like the Fury family as a whole. They may be rich, the may be famous but at the heart of it they are a normal family. Even though they could buy what ever they want I think it's very admiral that they watch their money. If it can be cheaper elsewhere they chose that option. The kids aren't spoiled and are taught the value of things and how they have to earn their way in the world. Paris needs a medal never mind Tyson. She puts up with a lot, has the patience of a saint and is naturally comincal they way she responds to daily life and the kids behaviour. Such a likeable family. Worth a watch - hope there will be a season 2, very, very soon.",True
7,3,Annoying,riamalhi,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI found it interesting at the start to see their day to day life but the more episodes I watched the more annoyed I became. It is clear to me that Tyson treats Paris horribly even with me only watching half of the episodes. I don't find seeing Paris treated badly as entertaining.He also clearly hates being at home ""hates the hard jobs"" but then contradicts himself to say he loves being at home with his wife and 6 kids. So which one is it? He'd rather be punched in the face than staying at home but loves spending times with the kids.Unfortunately, I cant stand to watch anymore of this show as not only do I find Tyson's arrogance irritating, it also seems to have shots that are retaken.",True
8,10,Brilliant,lisatweddle-63394,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brillant Show. Showed a different side to the family other than the show that's put on by Tyson. Really hope they do another season.

9,5,Damn...,fingazmc,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a Fury fan for years, although the feeling has dropped off a bit since avoiding Usyk and fighting Del boy for the third effing time.Now it's quite a good insight into the life of ""The Fury's"", but I just can not stand the format.I hate reality television, but watched because it was Tyson.But the talking heads every minute on about different things months apart while wearing the same clothes just reminds you how fake reality TV is.I still like Tyson as I suffer from a plethora of mental health issues also, but to be someone who says he doesn't care about money and then does this programme and the Ngannou JOKE of a ""fight"" is clearly full of BS!",False
10,9,Good fun and insightful,theearsdontlie,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a mental health sufferer this was helpful to me. It felt authentic, with lots of heart.I liked the whole family, it was. Crazy but sweet, honest. Paris was a shining light and deserves enormous praise for being such a supportive wife and loving mother.Love island Fury was good value as well with 'twice a day, daily' comment and announcing his intention of becoming an actor but only horror films.The candid passages regarding mental health were refreshing and provided me with much needed hope. The observations sounded so familiar,Exercise was cited as critical in maintaining a healthy mind....so instead of boozing I'm going to the gym tomorrow.Thanks Tyson.",False
11,8,I really enjoyed the series,catrine-48845,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm surprised at the low reviews. I found this series interesting. I thought it was going to be really dumb and being that there was nothing else on, I gave it a shot . I actually ended up enjoying it and binge watched it in two days . I guess this was made when Tyson was semi retired. I didn't realize he had a brother that was also a boxer. I really like Tysons wife, Paris. She seems to have a good head on her shoulders and a good mom having 6 children. Must be difficult when he is gone for such long periods of time but, she manages to keep it together. Even with all their wealth she tries to teach her Kids good morals and learning to work hard to get what you want. That nothing is handed to you and you need to earn it
His father also adds a lot to the series as well . He looks a lot like his dad. I didn't realize that Tyson has bipolar. The Series touches on a little about that and how difficult it is for the family.I'm not one to watch reality shows but , I'm really glad I watched this. I love to watch boxing in general so I found this pretty interesting. Give it a try and judge for yourself.",False
12,2,The big dosser,xanderjsanderson,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThey're all out of touch with reality. Every episode they go on and on about how humble they're which gets super boring. They walk around in designer clothes, drive around in lambos and they boast about wanting to buy another private jet. Then they buy some fish and chips and complain too the poor owner about how much they have to pay for it.Tyson goes around calling everyone dossers yet when he needs to clear his drive way or make a tip run he has a break down over it.It also seems that a lot of the events in this series are scripted just to make it more interesting. We have made it through 5 episodes not sure I can be bothered to finish it.",True
13,9,An in-depth look into the fury household,josephmm-58845,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis show was really enjoyable to watch. Tbh I didn't know much about the fury's until Tommy went on love island. Ever since then I've been interested in the family and this show showed a really in-depth look into their lives. I love how it shows Tyson for who he is and it's very evident that he is bipolar. He lives a crazy life of ups and downs and changes his mind and opinions rapidly which is amazing to watch and gives us an honest look into the family. You can't help but like the family and respect the gypsy king. It's great to see how the boxing effects the family and how his addiction to his sport won't stop.,True
14,1,Utter garbage.,frazerhodgkins,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerScripted reality nonsense, who on earth would give this anything but a 1*.Lets all pretend to be asleep and then walk around the house waking everyone up In the morning with a little scripted pep talk to show how great you really are in your multi million pound house thinking you are the same as everyone else, actually its just disgusting.I want to buy an airport, I'm bipolar ha ha ha.All this does is reinforce Netflix's inability to create original content, and the superficial needs of the people who actually like this tripe, Tyson Fury's only achievement in life is to effectively punch another person to the ground is this really what Netflix think is appropriate to portray as a role model for society?",True
15,1,Whining dosser,chickpeaboutique,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you don't have one of your own at home, and would like to watch a fabricated docu about a lazy man who does pretty much nothing (aside from go to the gym) complaining about how unbearable doing a jot of childcare is - here's your show!Tyson uses his metal health condition as an excuse for everything, including - according to a recent interview - cheating on his long suffering wife with over 500 women.Also these people are multimillionaires! Send your kids to private school instead of taking up 6 state paid places at comps!Why is this guy being treated by a hero? Imagine if the genders were reversed..",False
16,4,Boring,Sikloy19,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've watched a few episodes of this as I'd heard good things about it.I have to say I just found it very boring. Nothing happens! It's just him and his family going round doing mundane things.I think it's great that they seem down to earth and far more likeable than the vacuous Kardashian's, for example.The series seems to be themed mainly around Tysons mental health, and I sympathise greatly with his struggles but it almost seems like this series indulges in his behaviour, rather than confronting it with him.There's a lot of clips of the local area, the bay and their house for instance, which seems to be there to pad out the half hour.",False
17,5,Portrait of a heavyweight champ - tacky but sometimes interesting,WeeClaude,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm not a huge fan of reality TV, so I'm not the best person to review At Home with the Furys. On the other hand, I love boxing, and I've admired Tyson Fury since he defeated longtime heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko in...gosh, was it really 2015? How time flies.Spoilers follow...if you know Tyson Fury, you should know that this Netflix sort-of documentary was made at perhaps the dullest point in his career. Watching his dramatic comeback in 2018, when he overcame depression and substance abuse to reach the top of the boxing world a second time - now, that would make an interesting subject for a documentary. A series on his legendary trilogy of fights with Deontay Wilder would have been great, too.Instead, we get a post-Wilder TV show, which begins with Tyson Fury in semi-retirement. So, we get the dubious privilege of watching Fury sit around his surprisingly tacky mansion and complain about being bored. He makes big speeches about wanting to spend more time with his wife and six (!) children, but you know that deep down he yearns for a return to boxing glory.As a result, the first few episodes of ""At Home..."" are somewhat insufferable. The depressed and inactive Fury treats his wife and children poorly, and comes across as unsympathetic. The show gets more interesting around its midpoint, when he starts thinking about boxing again and becomes far more energized.Some of the side characters are pretty interesting. Fury's father John provides gravitas and folk wisdom, though no mention is made of his infamous eye-gouging brawl from 2010. Tyson Fury's wife Paris comes across pretty well. She's pragmatic and essentially plays the role of Adrian in a Rocky movie, by repeatedly telling her husband he shouldn't box any more. Some viewers find Paris very sympathetic, but I'm on the fence about that; she is curiously unmoved when Tyson's cousin is killed in a bar brawl, and her insistence on taking her young kids to see their father's boxing match with Derek Chisora seems odd.In short, nobody here is particularly relatable - except perhaps brother Tommy Fury and his partner Molly-Mae, who aren't as wealthy or out-of-touch as the show's stars. But they're really not in it enough to make a big impression.So why watch this show? Well, you might like it if you're interested in Fury as a personality, or in his frank discussions of his mental health struggles (particularly with bipolar disorder). Or you can view it as a slice of (somewhat inessential) boxing history. Or maybe you can simply bask in the lifestyles of the rich and famous (but if you ask me, the Furys spend way too much time at boringly pristine resorts and beaches).For me, this show was a mediocre but nice distraction. Overall, it's about as exciting as watching Fury-Chisora III - which as boxing fans will attest, was not really that exciting.",True
18,1,"wow ! just like ""eastbound&down""..",lampadaire20002,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow ! Just like ""eastbound&down"".....except, sadly, this one doesn't look like it's supposed to be a comedy (well i guess).It's just another reality-show that would make ""idiocracy"" looks like a biopic of Albert Einstein !It's fake, boring,useless and a bit scary i must say : yet those people are so egotic, dumb and disgusting that you sometime want to cry, and wonder what we did to get Humanity to such a low point of mediocrity...The good news is that you're still free switch off tv and read a book instead. That's what i did after polluating my mind watching those insane Flinstones after 20 unbearable minutes .Jeez , i must be really bored to crash into those things sometimes !I put this in my top ten of the worst things done by a human being ever.",False

1,9,Am I overthinking this?,rahat_59,n/a,15/08/2025,"See the 1 star reviews and sort them by helpfulness. See the reviewers' names, account details. Are those flies???",False
2,9,As a Documentary it's excellent and you can't deny it,golden_fighter_009,n/a,15/08/2025,"For some people this is propaganda because it involves politics but lets keep in mind it's not about the history of Saudia or the past of Jamal, no. It's about the a certain event Jamal's assassination that's it. People were responsible there is some damming evidence.
""People with willful blindness can ignore the facts""
The review section is full of calling it one sided but let it be clear the other side has to have facts and nothing to do with past life of Saudia and Jamal then.
Think for yourself and don't concern yourself with others opinion reach a decision. As from a person where these kind of assassinations of journalists and common people are normal this very thought provoking",False

8,n/a,A murder heard round the world. An important documentary about it.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"""When I speak of the fear, intimidation, arrests, and public shaming of intellectuals and religious leaders who dare to speak their minds, and then I tell you that I'm from Saudi Arabia, are you surprised?"" Jamal KhashoggiOctober 2, 2018 was a day to define the reach of Saudi tyranny as Jamal Khashoggi, the Saud Arabian editor and Washington Post columnist was brutally murdered. Bryan Fogel's documentary, The Dissident, seems to present the maximum amount of information extant, which points to the responsibility at the top of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS), who has experienced no sanctions so far.The Doc makes sure to include Khashoggi's fiancé, Hatice Cenzig, whose devotion to her valorous lover is quietly illustrated along with Fogel's favorable depiction of him as loveable, fair minded, and courageous. Not good enough to save him from the wrath of a royal family that brooks no dissidence.The evidence is overwhelming-reports from witnesses where Khashoggi was strangled by MBS personal security guard for over 7 minutes and dismembered with a saw visibly brought into the government building. It's highly probable his body was burned along with 70 pounds of meat to cover the smell from the interior vat.The real shame of this gruesome tale is that the noted journalist was fighting for freedom in a nation that has long needed it, as evidenced by the Arab Spring uprising in 2011, squelched but not forgotten by scribes like Khashoggi. That he wrote for a leading US paper only added more disdain from the West and anger from journalists around the world who have generally not been dismembered but have been tortured and vilified, even by the US's Donald Trump.Fogel's documentary is as nail biting as a thriller, and with its lack of closure for MBS (some Arabs were imprisoned for the murder), a profound anger from those around the world who still feel suppression from autocrats amd tyrants. As a matter of fact, MBS and Putin should compare notes.",False
9,6,The war of the fake accounts,Xavier_Stone,n/a,15/08/2025,"Tons of fake reviews and ratings on this film, both up and down. This movie has most of it's ratings as a 10 or 1.Several 1 star reviews have accounts that are suspiciously old, like 6 years, but the 7 reviews are all from the last two years. So are we supposed to believe that this person created an account, had it dormant for 5 years, then wrote 7 reviews???? Come on IMDB !! You are participating in this.As for the doc, it's an ok film. Icarus by Brian Fogel was a much better doc, but he got extremely lucky with an amazing set of circumstances. He's not so lucky here but manages to piece together enough information to get his point across.",False
10,10,We're Governed By Courtesans...,Xstal,n/a,15/08/2025,"... who drop their drawers to pout and wiggle at the most despicable, contemptible, reprehensible and detestable regime imaginable. A must see documentary on the alleged state execution of Jamal Khashoggi, clearly and calmly presented, leaves the viewer under no illusions, especially of the hypocrisy espoused by our own spineless leaders who sell their souls to the devil in support of barbarity, prejudice, hate and murder.",False
11,6,Important.....but perhaps too long?,kowas_2,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerThe subject matter was very important however to review this as a documentary rather than the story. As a film I found it dragged in parts and perhaps took too long to get anywhere. I guess we know the punchline from the start... wish there was more revelations. Why did the authorities have clear recording for the event? What did the Turkish investigation find? All the finger printing and taking his possessions wielded no significant revelation. I feel like if you basically followers the news at the time nothing too new was revealed. This being said the subject matter is very important and I hope this film will get the justice that was so obviously taken from Jamal. One question that I have is why did he go to the consulate?? Feels such poor insight from Jamal. He worked within the system he should have been well aware of the things they do for power. To get a document from the embassy is just stupid. No 1 he's a Muslim and he's marrying another Muslim and I'm pretty sure you can have more than one wife so what's the point of divorce and the proof of? Why even get married. When your enemy of the state I would not literally walk into the lions den. May be rest in power. A very unnecessary death and the worst cover up in history.,True
12,10,The truth,bjjahlan,n/a,15/08/2025,Amazing I think all the world know about the story and it is the truth,False
13,6,"well made, but not that interesting",djurrepower,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well made, but overall not that timeless. After the dust has settled on the whole fiasco it's just another story like many others. It has some good moments when it focuses more on the overall silencing of the media. But when it focuses more in the man himself, it loses its pace. So all in all, good but not great.6/10: sure.",False
14,5,The Story From one side,Jehad_1988,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Film has many true facts about the situation in Saudi Arabia, and about the day of Jamal's death. However, The Film didn't show everything happened later on about the killers or what they are facing at the moment.These activists work and behave like the Mafia or groups of criminals, we all saw what they have done during what they call ""The Arabian Spring"", They prefer to see Gulf countries in chaos. No one is against the reformation but there are many civilized ways to do it other than what they are doing right now.",False
15,8,"""The Dissident"" vs. """"Kingdom of Silence"": and the winner is...",paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Dissident"" is a documentary about the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. As the movie opens, it is ""Montreal, Quebec, January 20, 2019, three months after the murder of Khashoggi"", where we get to know Omar, a Saudi national and activist who now lives in exile, as he tells about the dangers he is facing. Omar had befriended Khashoggi, who had warned him ""This kind of work might get you killed."" We then go to ""Istanbul, Turkey, October 2, 2018"", as Khashoggi comes to the Saudi Consulate to pick up his papers so that he can marry his fiancée (who is waiting outside). At this point we are less than 10 min. into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the newest documentary from writer/director Bryan Fogel, whose previous film ""Icarus"" won the 2018 Best Documentary Oscar. Here he takes a new look at what really happened inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, and he unearths a number of shocking new evidence including the transcript of an audio tape of the murder . Along the way he provides ample screen time to Omar, the dissident in Montreal, and also to Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's fiancée. The latter puts a human face on the entire ordeal. Last but not least, the Turkish Prosecutor and police also pipe in. It all makes for a disturbing and at time shocking and uncomfortable viewing experience, with only one logical conclusion: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) will stop at nothing in his quest for power and correlating need to crush any and all dissent, not even a cold blooded murder of another Saudi citizen, in a Saudi Consulate no less. Along the way Fogel explains how the Saudi hacking technology works, and what to connection is with Jeff Bazos. You may recall that a few months ago there was a similar documentary on Showtime called ""Kingdom of Silence"", itself quite good as well. But in the end ""The Dissenter"" wins it by a nose or two, on the account of the deeper research that went into the making of this. But by all means check out both these films.""The Dissident"" premiered with immediate acclaim at this year's Sundance Film Festival back in January, yea in what feels is now a different (pre-COVID-19) decade altogether, Given Fogel's stellar track record, you'd think that distributors would be in a bidding war for this film, but the opposite happened: all major platforms and outlets (Netflix, which had distributed ""Icarus"", Amazon, Neon, Fox Searchlight, etc.) couldn't run away fast enough from this film, in an obvious sign that they didn't want the wrath of the Saudi Government for releasing this film. Just pitiful and sad. In the end, Fogel all but self-released this via a tiny indie outlet. The movie opened around Christmas in select theaters for a short run before pivoting in the near future to streaming services. The early evening theatrical screening where I saw this at the day after Christmas was attended poorly (exactly 3 people, including myself). Never mind. If you want to understand what all the Saudi Government will do to crush dissent of any kind, with the apparent blessing of Loser Trump who found nothing wrong with any of this, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",False
16,9,A well-crafted film on a subject of great importance,digsey_d,n/a,15/08/2025,"There's not much one can say about this documentary without chasing the very soul of the subject away, so to speak. Simply put, it is a vital detailing of the horrendous murder of an innocent man who spoke truth to power.It's a rare thing to find a film of such vital contemporary importance. Every person who watches this is better informed about the world they live in and the power structures that govern - or seek to control - each and every one of us.Pay no heed to negative reviewers, most if not all of which are almost certainly paid trolls with an agenda. This will be made clear in the film.",False
17,9,There is real evil in the world!,antrikshnarang-439-890558,n/a,15/08/2025,"Truth is often stranger , crueler and exhilarating than any piece of fiction. The story sheds light on real issues of humanity. Have we really advanced or are we the same barbarians hiding behind the veneer of technology? A must watch. Was referred by the joe rogan podcast.",False
18,n/a,Informative,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,This is a very informative documentary with a lot of interviews from people at the heart of the matter.,False
19,7,Stylish and informative but doesn't go deep enough,tawad-50373,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA well-made but one-sided documentary that goes through this horrid story. Doesn't add much to what was in the news except the Bees vs. the flies on twitter (very interesting). and of course reminds us of how dirty politics is.
Surprisingly doesn't mention the Turkey feud with Saudi outside of this incident, and doesn't question how Turkey was able to record what's happening inside an embassy (Spying is the new normal?)
Funny how Israel is the go-to country for spyware",True
20,10,Great Documentary!,aneen-18817,n/a,15/08/2025,I was waiting for this movie and I totally loved it!! Netflix chose to not stream this movie and rather support human abuses for money and growth subscribers. What a sham!!,False
21,7,Nothing new,jamas-79292,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nothing seemed to be new about the details, all were on the news",False
22,10,Highly recommended!,paradajzlove,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched it at the Zurich Film Festival. It's an insightful documentary on the murder of Jamal Kashoggi, that is absolutely worth seing. It touches on relevant topics, such as freedom of speech, human rights, Saudi propaganda, etc... and is also very informative in terms of cyberwar. It really breaks down the issues and brings them into context. I was impressed by the investigative journalism and storytelling. I am thankful to have been able to see this and appreciate the efforts of the filmmakers very much! I highly recommend The Dissident!",False
23,6,Extensive and comprehensive,Billiam-4,n/a,15/08/2025,"Extensive and comprehensive documentary on Jamal Khashoggi's murder,the perpetrators and the political motives behind it, although it still remains unclear why a regime would fear a single man so much that it reverts to such a hideous crime.",False
24,2,No subtitles,craigmundy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Half is in English and half foreign language with no subtitles, don't waste purchasing it.",False
25,10,A Thrilling and Tragic Ride!,david1080p,n/a,15/08/2025,"I got to see an early sneak peek via the International Documentary Association. I was impressed by the storytelling and journalism. While you may know about the tragic killing of Jamal Khashoggi, you probably don't know the real reason behind it, or what was really going on in Saudi Arabia. This documentary exposes both. It may well be the most important film of the year.",False

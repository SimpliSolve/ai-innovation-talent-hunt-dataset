1,n/a,Really important movie,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhether you know a lot about the antisemitism that erupted in college campuses after October 7th or you're just open to learning, this is a fantastic movie. I've been following these issues very closely, so not a lot about the movie was new information, but it was really moving to see some of the brave Jewish students fighting for themselves and for Israel on their college campuses. I watched a lot of what was shown in the movie in real time - from the passionate Columbia professor who told parents that their Jewish students weren't safe to the congressional hearings with college presidents, and it's crazy to think so much time has elapsed. There are some people fighting for Jews whom I probably don't agree with about one other thing, but it helps to show you that you can be on various places of the political spectrum and still choose to stand up for Israel.",True
2,10,Must Watch!,adam_karst-86220,n/a,16/08/2025,"October 8th is more than just a documentary-it's a harrowing wake-up call. The film delves into the aftermath of the October 7th attacks, shifting the focus to the day after, when survivors, families, and communities grappled with the shocking reality of what had just happened.What makes October 8th so powerful is its raw, unfiltered storytelling. It doesn't just recount events; it immerses you in the fear, confusion, and resilience of those affected. The firsthand testimonies, haunting footage, and deeply personal narratives make it impossible to look away.For me, this film was both eye-opening and deeply unsettling. It forced me to confront the depths of human suffering, the complexities of the conflict, and the lingering trauma that many are still experiencing. It left me with a heavy heart but also a renewed sense of urgency to understand and engage in meaningful conversations.Whether you think you know the full story or not, October 8th challenges you to look closer. It's not an easy watch, but it's an important one.",False
3,7,the ides of october,dromasca,n/a,16/08/2025,"Much will be written and many films will be made about the events triggered by the terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, and the war in Gaza. The conflict continues and it is not clear how and when it will end (if it will ever end), and what is being written or filmed now are the first artistic reflections, which have the advantage of proximity to the events and the disadvantage of a lack of historical perspective. Too early? Perhaps it is never too early. 'October 8', the production directed by Wendy Sachs, is one of the first such documentary films, dealing with the impact and echo of the events in the United States and especially on American universities, in the days and months that followed that infamous day of terror in the fall of 2023. The period covered is less than a year, as the filmmakers wanted the premiere to take place exactly one year after the events. Such a film cannot avoid controversy and the way it is seen and received also depends on the viewers, on their degree of familiarity with the events and their context, on their political opinions if any.The authors do not hide their sympathies. The film begins with a brief recapitulation of the horrors of the morning of October 7. These will always be in the background and will be recalled several times throughout the film, with an emphasis on aspects related to the fate of the Israeli hostages or the unimaginable violence against women. The focus of the film's authors' was, however, directed to something else. What happened on October 8 (a metaphorical date for the entire period that followed)? How were the events received and how were the reactions in the media, in international organizations, in the artistic community and especially on American university campuses? Protests, accusations, attempts to blame Israel for the events appeared immediately, even before any Israeli response. Combining filmed images (most of them well-known) with testimonies and interviews involving students and professors, activists from international or Jewish organizations, artists and politicians, 'October 8' builds a worrying picture of the influence of Hamas propaganda in Islamic organizations, of the protests that often took violent forms and paralyzed the activities in some American universities, of the atmosphere of threats and intimidation to which many Jewish students were victims. The general picture is worrying, but at the same time, the dignified attitude and bright figures of a few young people determined to respond courageously, firmly defending their rights, awaken hope.'October 8' manages to reveal many details about phenomena happening in America these years. I watched the film at a screening followed by a discussion with two of the authors. From what they said, I understood that the target audience is the American and international audience, less the Israeli audience, who should be more familiar with the facts. The film has clarity and clearly and convincingly exposes the positions of the authors and those interviewed, but I still think that it lacks a broader perspective on events and a presentation of other opinions. How does Palestinian propaganda manage to penetrate with such ease environments that should be armed with a basic education, such as universities? Interviews with professors or activists who would articulate (preferably with arguments) different positions would have been interesting. The different positions within the American Jewish community are also completely missing. 'October 8' manages to be a manifesto film that convincingly conveys the message the authors wanted, but it fails to be an investigation that goes into depth to the causes of the phenomena exposed and presents them in a more diverse context. However, it will certainly be a film cited in the many future documentaries and books that will follow.",False
4,1,Not really impressed,JakeS-39,n/a,16/08/2025,"The narrative of the story is very one sided, having a very heavy impact of displaying a biased approach. I wish this film captured different angles of the story, but unfortunately I saw divert little no effort at all. I could have had a whole different experience. Hope you find this insightful as a viewer. It is also important to acknowledge that this film focuses on key points of events, without much acknowledgement. It's a unique perspective to be in the Middle East, and this could have been portrayed in a way better way. It really is a shame that it did not capture all it had at its disposal.",False
5,1,Didn't Do It For Me,DrD3,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found the whole premise of the documentary boring and redundant and tedious and unconvincing. They certainly tried hard to get their version of occurrences and events across, but I have seen more persuasive productions with more compelling casting. I was hoping for something more substantial than what they were trying to imply. There certainly are a number of documentaries worth watching these days such as the recent Oscar winning documentary ""No Other Land"" or Louis Theroux ""The Settlers"" which properly deals with contemporary and historical issues that are of vital importance. These two documentaries certainly have a substantially high rating among viewers.",False
6,n/a,"Slick production, hollow substance - more PR than documentary",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"October 8 is presented with the gloss of a high-budget documentary, but beneath the cinematic polish lies a glaring lack of balance. The film leans heavily into one narrative, leaving out critical voices and perspectives that would've added much-needed context. Instead of confronting complexity, it simplifies - portraying events with emotional cues and select testimonies that feel more like a coordinated message than truth-seeking.Documentaries should challenge power, not echo it. This one reads like a script approved in a boardroom. The omission of dissenting Jewish voices, Palestinian realities, and credible counter-narratives betrays the genre. It's less journalism, more performance.A missed opportunity to explore truth - replaced with something disturbingly theatrical.",False
7,10,Really eye opening,talyaressel,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary tackles the subject with the right level of journalistic curiosity, sensitivity and balance.There will be many who don't want to acknowledge or will struggle to hold more than one narrative can exist. We need to exploring what occurred in the aftermath of Oct 7th. The fact that this film/documentary was made, and made so well, is a testament to its team who must have fought an uphill battle to get this out there. I implore people to watch it with an open mind, to be able to see what's happening right in front of themShould be compulsory view - painful, insightful and necessary.",False
8,10,Must watch,LesleyR-0,n/a,16/08/2025,Educational and interesting. A must watch to learn about the post October 7th world. Many points of views were presented in an engaging way. I left the theatre moved and sad yet uplifted by the possibility of a better world. It is a movie you want to watch more than one time. It is well researched with credible sources. So many interesting people were interviewed. Well done. Well researched. Respectful of the sensitive nature of the content. I found the young students interviewed to be inspirational and beautiful souls. The movie left you with a desire to learn more and do our share to improve the world.,False

11,10,A must watch!!!,nitzan_sol,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to know what Jews have experienced since the horrors of Oct 7th, you must watch this film. This film is filled with activists who have fought tooth and nail since that terrible day to show the truth of the situation without dehumanizing Palestinians. I, for one, am thankful for this documentary to be out in the world.For people who are afraid of seeing traumatizing footage from Oct 7th, please know that this film is not that. It focuses on the way the world has reacted after that terrible day. It organizes the facts in a concise, methodical way to make it easy to understand. Thank you to Noa Tishby, Debra Messing, Ritchie Torres, and the makers of this film.",False
12,9,Powerful and important,imdbfan-6699323694,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was powerful and so important in its efforts to share and balance the information circulating, the understanding of the history for those impacted and the terrifying length some are willing to go, especially without true understanding of how we have all arrived at this very moment in time.No one people should be in danger on this planet in place of another. The humanitarianism for both sides comes through in this documentary. No more lives should be lost or lived in fear on either side of this unique historical and continuing battle. This film seeks only to balance to understanding, build compassion and does not in any way place more value on one life or people above another. It simply asks us to consider everyone.It was painful and difficult to watch in some parts and yet I feel fortunate I was able to stand witness in any way to the atrocities.... For all.The goal was clearly and truly to bring together and not create further divide, just further compassion, empathy and understanding of what has for so long felt like a hopeless pursuit of peace. If willing to watch with open hearts, this film has the potential to move us in the direction of unity, hope and peace....and above all, safety.",False

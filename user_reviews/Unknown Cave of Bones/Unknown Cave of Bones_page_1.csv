1,7,INTERESTING AND WELL PUT TOGETHER,bobr-37646,n/a,15/08/2025,In order to review this movie you need to consider how good it is in terms of filmmaking and also the validity of the scientific claims that are being made. I've been interested in evolution and paleontology my whole life and have seen countless documentaries on this subject. It's very difficult to lay out a complex story in an hour and a half so I realize that we're not going to see all of the little details required to actually prove what they're saying. I would like to have seen more evidence that the rock they discussed is actually a stone tool but it's obvious that these creatures used tools to make those very distinctive carvings. It also seems certain that they did in fact bury their dead which certainly means that they weren't as primitive as they might have appeared with their small brains. So it was informative as well as entertaining for those of us who are interested in science and definitely worth watching.,False
2,7,Between Science and Documentary Drama,rev-andrei,n/a,15/08/2025,"The subject in itself is very interesting, which helps the documentary, which is also very well produced.However, I felt that scientists seem too passionate about the subject to give a more balanced or less biased opinion.In addition, at a certain point the chief scientist passes by a cave location and makes an incredible discovery. However, how many did not pass by there? How could they not see?The life and culture of Homo Naledi seemed too romanticized to me, with a lot of speculation and no dissenting voices.That's why everything in the documentary seems to me to be partly scripted, disclosing possibly previous discoveries as if they were made in front of the cameras.",False
3,6,"It's Good, But...",fargoesto11,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think the subject matter is super interesting and the cinematography is really great.However, I feel like the Scientists have done the classic poker term of ""falling in love with your hand"" meaning, they are making very bold statements, leaning towards calling them facts about something that is purely speculative.I would love to see or hear from another team of Scientists that have little or no knowledge of this subject matter and to hear what their conclusions are.I personally think there are some other obvious ways and methods that these remains could have made it to their final resting spots.None the less, if you're into science, dawn of human and cave exploration, you'll enjoy this. I did.I respect the dedication and years that the Scientists have put in here. Their passion is palpable, albeit possibly a bit one sided.",False
4,n/a,Way too speculative,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"It starts off pretty good, but quickly descents into a very speculative realm. At one point they claim that these creatures had to use fire in the cave, otherwise they couldn't find their ways. Right, is this what rodents do when navigating caves? I haven't seen many torch carrying mice lately. Or, who knows, perhaps the cave layout changed in 250k years and used to be light coming from somewhere. All questions that popped in my head, none of which were answered.There are no counter arguments whatsoever. These people love their jobs, that's obvious, but I'm missing a different perspective. A different take on their theories that could explain the observed as well. Now everything is presented as fact, which it clearly is not.",False
5,7,"Enjoyed it, but with one major doubt",nicktravascio,n/a,15/08/2025,"I enjoyed the documentary and particularly appreciated the cartoon scenes that help the viewer understand the cave system and what this species might have been like. There is one aspect that I just find implausible about the theory of how the bones got to their resting spot. These ape/human creatures somehow ventured deep into a cave system with very tight and steep passageways with no light. It would have been pitch black for hundreds of yards AF advanced cave exploration while carrying their dead. They show an example of how you could bring fire into the cave to light the way. Sure that works for an open area, but the 36 ft chute that is super tight and straight down isn't something you could traverse while carrying lit torches. Plus you'd have to go hours in and hours out which would have required lots of wood. They would have been regularly stuck in the cave with no way to see a thing and died in there. Show me one crew going all the way to the end and back using fire as light and I'm on board otherwise this just isn't believable.",False
6,6,Interesting but speculative,misterjupiter,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very interesting movie, but take the opinions of the scientists shown in the movie with a grain of salt, since they are everything but objective. Burying a dead body with a tool is far from being evidence of belief in the afterlife, or any belief at all. It's just a sign of respecting the personal property of the deceased and shows, that Homo Naledi was capable of feeling emotionally attached to things, not only showing emotions for other members of their species. Scientists projecting their personal beliefs and views instead of interpreting the facts, sadly that more common than it should be.",False
7,7,Interesting,sarah-68808,n/a,15/08/2025,"Note- I am not a religious scholar of any sort. This documentary gave me shivers and reminded of something I read ages ago. There is a mention of creatures other than humans in the Islamic book of Quran and they were called ""jinn"". According to Quran, they were created before Adam and Eve and were responsible for cultivating and improving the world. Jinn are said to inhabit caves, deserted places, graveyards and darkness. Jinn are supposed to be composed of thin and subtle bodies. According to Sakr2 they marry, produce children, eat, drink and die but unlike human beings have the power to take on different shapes and are capable of moving heavy objects almost instantly from one place to another. They had families and societies.There are numerous references to jinn in the Qur'an and Hadith (sayings of Prophet Mohammed). According to Islamic writings, jinn live alongside other creatures but form a world other than that of mankind.",False
8,6,One Major Flaw Stood Out and Ruined It!,dd_bay,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found it a very entertaining, although overly-dramatized documentary. I'm a layman, although well read and understand a bit about archeology and paleontology.So I'm watching them excavate this burial site, and coming to all these conclusions about ""dozens and dozens of bodies"" found there (which was not what they showed us)...and I'm waiting...and waiting...was there any evidence of cave paintings, carvings, or any symbolic artifacts left behind in what was apparently a burial chamber? And nobody researching down there even mentions it. Here is a team of supposedly highly experienced and qualified scientists and researchers, and nobody mentions or asks about that obvious aspect. And it was bothering me. First thing I'd look for!Then Berger finally goes down there after eight years in the upstairs ""command center"" (which he reminded us about maybe a half-dozen times), and lo and behold...HE DISCOVERS CARVINGS! Wow! All those other paleontologists totally missed those very large, visible and obvious carvings on the wall leading into the chamber for the past EIGHT YEARS-walking right past them-and Mr. Berger ""discovers"" them like it's the Rosetta Stone! Amazing!That was such poor writing and an obviously orchestrated cinematic device that I then began to doubt much of the rest. What a shame.That said, I'm happy this documentary was made, as it will introduce many laymen to the science and study of ancient man and mankind, and most will not be as critical as many of us who reviewed the (poorly titled) ""Unknown: Cave of Bones.""",False
9,9,"MY TAKE ON ELEMENTS THAT MAKE ""CAVE OF BONES"" SO TANTILIZINGLY UNIQUE",Tony-Kiss-Castillo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Let me begin this REVIEW with a bit of a Disclaimer:
Human evolution and development has been one of my HOT-BUTTON TOPICS since I was a kid in the 50's!What really impressed and intrigued me most about CAVE OF BONES was that rather than being laser focused on any of our direct human ancestors... BONES instead looks at a human cousin from 2 million years ago... a species categorized in the HOMO genus.(We are, of course, HOMO SAPIENS) but honestly, I don't recall ever hearing about any other species categorized in the HOMO genus!) However, as is the case with the vast majority of our genetic cousins... Here is yet another species that ended up in the dust heap of history! Just ONE MORE EXAMPLE of history's innumerable hominid evolutionary DEAD ENDS!The particular ancient hominid presented here was apparently capable of a myriad of thoughts and activities that previously were attributed exclusively to Humans! By analyzing the precise layout of the labyrinth of caves where paleontologists discovered these remains... They were able to deduce many notably interesting things about these ancient close relatives!First and foremost, that the only logical conclusion that can be reached is that these much smaller brained hominids believed in an afterlife and engaged in a long list of highly organized rituals in relation to these beiefs and their treatment of the remains of their dead clan members for burial!In addition, evidence of burned out campfires were clearly obvious... and owing to the pitch blackness of some of the undergound passages, it was clearly evident that these creatures had mastered the use of FIRE! These recently discoveries also prove that HUMANS are not the ONLY species in the history of our planet who believed in and conducted rituals related to an afterlife.Yesterday, I checked to see exactly what percentage of genetic material we share with CHIMPS... 98.7% was the answer! Of course, there is no way of doing a laboratory DNA comparison in 2023 with the hominids presented in this documentary, but if that DNA test WERE possible, I would bet that the result would be in the neighborhood of 99.5%!Many of my favorite films invite You to ask Yourself... ""Exactly what is it that makes us HUMAN???"" BONES most certainly does make You ask Yourself that very question... And in a way that is quite fresh and unanticipated! Whenever I decide to POST a REVIEW of a film... I always watch it twice! BONES was so intricate and thought provoking, I have already watched it 3 times! Of course, I would not expect many of You would want to do the same... But I am SURE a second viewing will surprise You as to how much more you gleen from this most unusual Documentary!Even if human evolution is not one of your preferred focus subjects... If You DO like ""DIFFERENT"", most certainly You will appreciate this NETFLIX Documentary immensely!ENJOY!!/DISFRUTELA.",False
10,6,Enjoyed it but it is too long,josepmesteves,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't know anything about Homo Naledi before watching this documentary. I learnt a lot and enjoyed watching it.The documentary is well put together in a way that draws you in and guides you along many discoveries about Homo Naledi. Personally, I found it fascinating, but also a bit annoying due to the its slow pace and exaggeration.I feel like the documentary duration should be less than half. It felt a bit repetitive and slow paced.The scientists seem to really love what they were doing and the discoveries they made. But it felt like a bit too out of proportion. I guess in the field these discoveries must have been revolutionary, but to someone who is not passionate about archeology it may feel like they are just repeating how these discoveries change everything and becomes a bit annoying as you go through the documentary.I'd recommend watching if you want to watch a relaxed, slow paced documentary.",False
11,3,Too many assumptions without proof.,mktmaven,n/a,15/08/2025,"These individuals assume the Homo Naledi made this ritualistic climb in a cave to bury their dead. You're not geologists you're archeologists. The whole cave structure could have been different 250,000 years ago. They could have just walked in and walked out, yet you assume way too much with no solid proof. You want to spin a narrative to fit your story. You're scientists get data before you reach a conclusion. Early on you admitted the entrance of the cave collapsed, yet you have no geologists on your team to give you data for your hypotheses. Please look at all possibilities before televising documentaries that are purely speculative.",False
12,9,9 stars for the way it is produced. 7 stars for the final for the scientific evidence,jtjayesh-16721,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a film-making critic, it is quite well made, and the archeological work shown is pretty well-done as well. However, looking through the scientific lens, and then review, I don't feel overly confident about it. Not to say that there is no basis for what the scientists are claiming, but there are barely any counter-arguments that are entertained in this piece. So watch it, for the enthusiasm of scientists and the story-telling of the producers.Regardless, the research done and shown is inspiring and really intellectual, if not a little stretched in the claims, and it makes for a good watch if you are interested in the field.",False
13,7,Speculative science,benwright-94312,n/a,15/08/2025,"A really exciting and important subject that got me quite emotional at times, imagining these early hominids and their complex and emotional lives...but that's the problem, it was over the top emotional and spiritual and not enough science.Implying that burying bodies means they believe in an afterlife? Bodies are buried because you want rid of them but think they deserve more than just being left to rot. I didn't bury my cat because I thought it was going to cat heaven!The attempts to force spiritualism on these hominids was almost cringe worthy at time.I still recommend watching it though.",False
14,2,POSSIBLY HISTORY SHATTERING,tonjud,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have over 25 years as an amateur paleontologist working with doctoral paleontologist. I have discovered new dinosaur species over 120 million years old and have published my findings. I know the similarities between archaeology and paleontology and also the differences. In this film I was disappointed with the lack of research discussion given these bones of possibly a new humanoid species. No credible research was discussed to support their assumptions for a new species or activities of the humanoids. Too much time was spent showing the archaeologists and workers climbing over rocks and squeezing through tight places. Those disappointments aside, I was quite shocked that the bones were not scanned to produce an assembled three dimensional skeletal image of the new find; a process that is now used particularly for new rare discoveries. More detail should have been given to support the assumption that there was just no other way into the cave. I wasn't convinced that these ancient beings would have been able to carry dead bodies in for burial through a very difficult passageway. I think Lee Berger should have been more convincing in his speculation about it being the only way in for the ancient beings. Maybe earth quakes over the thousands of years ago may have alter the passageway. Basically not enough research was presented to propose such an important discovery and name a new humanoid species.",False
15,7,Potentially ground-breaking...potentially,souplahoopla,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was going to give this six stars but settled on a seven because this 'potentially' could be a real game changer, and I felt, after the last Unknown: segment of 'lost pyramid' sort of marred my opinion of this series of documentaries I should be fair.So, this instalment involves a group of archaeologists and palaeontologists investigating a series of rather inaccessible caves in South Africa, where they have discovered a human ancestor 'Homo Naledi' burial site from 250,000 years ago.Now, I'm obsessed with ancient history of all kinds so, like the last instalment, I was not going to miss, good or not.Thankfully this documentary is far more in depth, far more fact based and far more interesting then their 'lost pyramid' episode. I wont ruin any of it for people who have not seen it, but its a really nicely put together, informative and interesting film, with some very effective artists impression animation to try and visualise these people and their possible movements and motivations.Where this documentary falls short is it quite romanticised at times. This maybe down to the team who produced it. It makes a lot of assumptions and claims with, while possible, no evidence. And could have been made more credible by making far more likely claims like (slight spoiler), instead of attributing leaving a grave good as leaving a favourite object of a loved one, they attribute it solely as meditation on an afterlife. They also try to define a grave as definitively a burial and not funeral caching.However, these are some really fascinating discoveries. It seems unlikely this was anything but intentional and does really combat the idea of 'stupid caveman' and you dont need a huge brain to care for your loved ones. We see the product of loss in many other animals today so why we dont give out own ancestors enough credit never made sense to me.I really enjoyed this documentary. The cinematography is great, and although some of the interviews are slightly gushy, its really worth a watch. But take some of it with a pinch of salt.",False
16,6,An fairly engaging yet speculative look at the lives and rituals of the Homo Naledi! [+63%],arungeorge13,n/a,15/08/2025,"This will be an interesting watch for anyone interested in the evolution of the human species. The storytelling is earnest and compelling, and the footage they come up with is top-notch. It'll make you feel claustrophobic alright, but the scientists' and explorers' eventual findings will thrill you. The makers also do a fine job of recreating what the Homo Naledi would have supposedly looked and behaved like, and the visual depiction adds another intriguing layer to the understanding of the scientists. Most of the conclusions the scientists have here are speculative, and it would've been fascinating to see what another team (similar to the one we see featured in the piece) of scientists thought about the various hypotheses.",False
17,7,Cave of assumptions,mickydu,n/a,15/08/2025,"A well made documentary with great production and storytelling that's captivating enough for an interesting subject. The feature of just one burial throughout the ""dozens of bodies"" in the cave isn't compelling enough for the entire documentary. What happened to the other bodies in the eight years they spent excavating ? Where are the scientific facts of what age they were etc? Those details would've made it a lot more interesting. Could the entire cave be a completely different environment over the last 300 000 years ? If you think a tool is amongst the most important thing to have ever been found with a Homo Naledi surely you'd carefully extract it and find out and not assume. Finding one bone of an animal does not equate they cooked in there. Too many assumptions not enough hard evidence.",False
18,7,Intelligent speculation,s-ikeda728,n/a,15/08/2025,This is amazing. The find is incredible. My question is the geology - that cave system must've been different a quarter of a million years ago. And I think there was more humanization added to make these beings more like us and less like an evolutionary step. Maybe the beginning of emotions? Maybe like elephants? We will never really know.Maybe humans see themselves too much in others. Maybe we experience emotions more than other animals. It's interesting to think. Are we putting ourselves in them? I don't know. No one will ever know. Too bad we can't go back and check. This is all speculation.,False
19,8,What Makes One Human?,PalmBeachG,n/a,15/08/2025,"What makes one human? That's the ""real"" question when you watch this documentary. These scientists have made a fantastic recent discovery deep inside a cave of skeletons which, after much scientific research, has been classified as a ""new species"" that is ""not human"". However, after another visit to the cave, it is then later discovered actual graves, burials, fires, cooking, and even pictorials carved in the walls and a skeleton buried with a tool in it's hand that is supposed to have been used to carve those pictorials with. These skeletons and supposed non-human species have been dated to 250,000 - 300,000 years ago and would be the oldest species to do these things including the burials which suggest a spiritual or religious connection. So to me, the real question is what makes one human? The rules the scientist has set forth, or is there so much more that we don't know that hasn't been discovered yet? One other note - when they turn off the lights deep in the cave to experience the total darkness to feel what it was like in those days to navigate the cave system - I would suggest everyone do this at least once in their lifetime. Growing up in the US, it is common to tour our cave systems and I have visited numerous caves including one that has fish with no eyes because of the total darkness. On the.tour they turn off the lights so you can experience total darkness - no lights, no starlight, no moon light; just total nothingness. It makes you think and is so scary and an experience you won't forget.",False
20,6,Very interesting and then maybe do some extra research,cunaguaroselvatico,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI won't add to the criticisms here that already point out several holes in the theory of how the bodies got to this steep narrow chamber. I agree, probably they got in some other way 250000 years ago. I also would have rathered they edited out the bit when the senior anthropologist of the expedition couldn't convert mm to cm. Nonetheless I found the doco super interesting I hadn't heard of Homo Naledi before. I've been to Cradle of Humankind and the doco makes me want to return more informed. When we went to I think it was Sterkfontein cave where they also found hominid remains, the explanation is that probably they fell through a hole in the marsh soil above. Seems more likely. This does not cancel out that Homo Naledi may have had burial rituals, carved hashtag/diamond figures on rocks or anything else. That could be true. But dragging the body through a cave that several others might die in the process maybe not so likely.",True
21,3,Bafflingly awful,chris-hagon,n/a,15/08/2025,"I felt compelled to leave a review because while I am no anthropologist some actions seem baffling. And by that I mean unscientific to the point of reckless.Witness the leading lights of anthropology handle bones several hundred thousand years old without gloves - even my car mechanic wears gloves. I mean, seriously?Then we have this absolute gem:""How do we convert centimetres to millimetres?""
""Why must you make my life difficult?"" - spoken by the 'Senior' Archaeologist.That ladies and gentleman is the level of intelligence we are viewing. It's shocking.Added to this are utterances such as ""it'll change what we think it means to be human"" followed by a pause and a deep look. And this means what exactly? Change how?And let's not get started on the assumptions. There is nothing but projection and conjecture to introduce and religious overtones and as others have pointed out, 250k years ago the whole cave system would've been different and possibly not even a cave at all.Overall, depressingly bad.",False
22,10,Interesting!,ilynotex,n/a,15/08/2025,"This docu was much more convincing than the first one on the pyramids in Sahara. Watch together with my wife and we both utterly enjoyed. I actually got a nightmare that night. I suspect, the movie shook me somewhat deep inside. Highly recommend! 10/10 from me.I'm hoping that Netflix continues with these series. This remind me childhood feeling of awe and wonder about mysterious things. Yet, by watching this docu, I got that feeling even I'm an adult now.Finally, I realized that we belong to homo - a genera - like in an animal kingdom. This is a strange thought, since ordinary we feel like we are different from animals. To sum up - this gave me a lot of food for thought.",False
23,5,Speculations...,akogkas-91887,n/a,15/08/2025,"Interesting. The ""scientists"" seem so eager to show off for simply speculating this and that and constantly talking about a huge moment for the history of humanity... No it is not. And the luck of scientific approach! Omg. Even the excavation is sloppy. Didn't expect much from Netflix but this is annoying.What has happened to facts nowadays... To watch scientists present themselves as so emotionally involved and stunned by their own assumptions is making me feel dubious about the true motives about that project. Even the kissing of the skull from the scientist during the press conference is so cringy.",False
24,10,Touched my heart and very soul,minachgo,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst, about me. I love God: Padre of Jesus, animals and nature. To know we are not the 1st to use tools, bereave - bury our dead (with meaningful items at that) and creat art is shockingly exciting. We all know how many feelings animals have - especially when it comes to their offspring is endearing and makes us love them even more. Knowing that then knowing a species in between an ape and a human was very advanced 250,000 years ago- 180,000 years before what we thought was the 1st and not human is mind-boggling. The history books should not be rewritten but amended and flowing since we may find a whole new species at the North Pole or Amazon that is older and wiser.I cried so much watching the reenactment of this species and Berger going into the chimney then chamber.**Lastly, I do not think it is about the size of brain but how much of it you use.",True
25,4,More Human Interest Story Than Science Sadly,The-Ambassador,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not really worth a 600 word review unfortunately. But fine. This could have might have been an interesting or even fascinating anthropology discovery story as implied and stated by the producers in the trailer and description. But in reality there is very little science here. About 20 minutes in total - and that's generous - of the doc has science in it - about ostensibly a possible new genus Homo species these paleoanthropologists call Homo Naledi. The problem is it's just a small team from nowhere USA who haven't as of yet gained any national or international scientific corroboration of their find. They imagine a ton of wild theories about their discovery, all interesting but unfounded. So instead they spend a good hour or more filming things like ""can this heavy-set man fit through a small cave opening?"" Just not science.",False

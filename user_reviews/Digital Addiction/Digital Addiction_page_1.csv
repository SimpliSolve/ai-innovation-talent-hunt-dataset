1,7,Even more addictive than being on my phone,kendallschristopher,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is yet another documentary about the fall of Western civilization from A&E, this time around about people's addiction to not just their phone, but all electronic communication devices. Some of these people have 5 or 10 devices they use simultaneously.In typical A&E fashion we see the depravity and we see people being confronted with the possibility of counseling and therapeutic treatment, or alienation from their loved ones. Where this documentary fails is that even those that refuse treatment wean themselves off of their devices simply because they were confronted by their loved ones. Digital addiction does not seem to be as strong as hoarding or heroin addiction.It is interesting when we see that some people think they'll make a living off of social media, but end up exploiting themselves and making enough to make ends meet, but nothing to write home about. Sort of how someone addicted to crack cocaine does just enough to score more drugs. When people realize they won't be an influencer and they're the ones being influenced, they give up their habits quickly.",True
2,1,Annoying and pointless,HorribleDrBones,n/a,15/08/2025,"I tried watching it and the people being interviewed were so annoying and vapid. I couldn't take it anymore and turned it off. If I want trash TV, I'll tune into TLC. At least some of those shows hold my interest.",False
3,2,Trashy,GrammarMatters,n/a,15/08/2025,This 'documentary' is shown in a cheap tabloid expoitative style and has a Maury Povich feel to it.It gave me the feeling of exploiting internet addicts for entertainment and grabbing attention the with portraying idiotic people.I had to stop watching this trash. It's all about entertainment by seeming to make fun of these addicts.Totally unpleasant to watch.,False
4,9,Eye opening,mauricioinserenity,n/a,15/08/2025,A very good show that raises awareness of how many people are becoming addicted to technology. A must see in this day and age. I'm glad this show exist and is a nice way to share ideas with some friends who may be addicts but don't know it yet since it's so normalized to be obsessed with technology nowadays.,False

1,n/a,Mostly a Twitch VOD compilation with no commentary on anything. What was the goal here?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary was so weirdly edited. It jumped from very energetic, upbeat gamign footage to minutes of dead-silent Twitch VODs, interspersed with ""bloop!"" text messages appearing on screen. A jarring experience and after 20 minutes, quite tedious to watch.The documentary also jumped wildly between topics, going from the relationship with D_Gurl to trolls to BOTW speedrunning and none of these aspects really connected.80% of the documentary is just Twitch VODs edited together, and not in a way that makes Narcissa look sympathetic. There's Narcissa getting 3k views on BOTW launch date while being featured on Twitch, yet she is annoyed that it's not 20k viewers (an absolutely absurd number to aim for). The remaining 20% is new footage when Narcissa and D_Gurl met and seemed to have had a nice day or two out in the sun. I understand that the filmmakers can't travel back in time to take footage of Narcissa, but it would have been nice to see more then just some beauty shots and one drone clip with new footage.There are no interviews with anyone, no real background info besides some of Narcissa's earliest family photos and home video.If you already know who Narcissa is, this documentary will give you absolutely nothing new or interesting.Ultimately this documentary left me confused. It clearly tried to make me feel sympathetic towards Narcissa, but then it also included the shot of Narcissa puking on the mountain. For a commentary on trolling there was not enough trolling in the documentary. For speedrunning it's the same. None of these aspects were really discussed in the movie, hence this could have easily been a 45min YouTube video chronicalling Narcissa's downfall. It really feels like Narcissa herself didn't even care about the movie.BTW: justinlstanley is the film's DP (for those roughly 11 minutes of footage that ended up in the final cut), to give some context to their 10 star rating of this movie.",True
2,10,A gaming doc that makes you think,justinlstanley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Break The Game is a powerful film that manages to address the toxicity of stream culture, digital identity, and LGBTQ issues all at once. Masterfully edited from countless hours of twitch video streams and bolstered by amazing animated pixel art- Break The Game keeps you locked in for its entire runtime. At its core this movie is a love story between two streamers who fall in love and navigate the digital realm. Mental health topics are masterfully handled with a sensitivity and respect for our main subject. This film is a solid directorial debut from Jane M, Wagner, I look forward to seeing more films from her.",False
3,9,A Great Movie That Showed Me The Beauty and Horrors of Online Connection,haashaasgarapati,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched a screening of this movie at PAX East and really enjoyed watching it. It's a movie that feels quite raw because of how unedited a lot of the footage is (especially the twitch footage). I didn't know who Narcissa Wright was until a day before watching the documentary, but the film took me on a great journey that helped me understand Narcissa as a person. It gives some context to a lot of the strange and self-depreciating things that Narcissa did when the internet dogpiled on her, and it gave me a new perspective. Hell, I could've easily been a person who thought that Narcissa was insane if I saw some of her breakdowns out of context. But the film helped me sympathize with her. Narcissa is definitely not a perfect person and she can be hard to sympathize with sometimes, but the film did a good job at (once again) showing WHY she thought in certain ways and it made it much easier to sympathize with her. Yeah, 20,000 peak views is an objectively insane goal to reach. But considering what she wanted to prove to the world and herself, it makes sense why she suspended her disbelief for that unattainable goal. I hope that Narcissa, D-gurl (who I actually met at the screening), and the other people involved in this films events are in a better place, and I'm grateful that a light was shone on this story.",True

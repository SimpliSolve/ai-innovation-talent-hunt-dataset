1,9,What's an amazing story!,heni-jordan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Every time I see such a young talent, it warms my heart, and it seems this guy is not only a born talent, but he also managed to remain a very good human being and a humble individual...which is so out of the box, especially these days.It's definitely a movie for his generation, watching it felt like a TikTok style style series of videos but others will find the beauty in it too. It definitely requires intelligence as its not feeding you with thoughts but you have to put together some pieces yourself. So if you expect American style, no brainer this is not your cookie.It's a mix of everything, cannot be categorized, just like Azahriah's music. It's a documentary , it's concert, It's music, It's fantasy, its drama., it's inspirational. I expected no less from someone who doesn't like be categorized and put in a box.Although I am not his generation, I understand that this speedy world and these young people don't settle with one or two things, they want it all and they want it now , even in a movie.Said that I learned that this young man waited for this tremendous success for 10 years and watching this movie made me realize how hard he worked and how committed he was towards his goal.I remember a line in the movie him saying even though he is trying hard, he is unable to translate everything into music that he has in his head.I can't even imagine how he would make people feel if he was able to...Thank you for this inspirational story and hope we will get to see and hear more of your universes.",False

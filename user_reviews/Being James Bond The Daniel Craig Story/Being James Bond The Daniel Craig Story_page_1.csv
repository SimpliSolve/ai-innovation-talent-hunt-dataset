1,8,Nice documentary to mark Craig's Bond,Kingslaay,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember the outcry when Craig was first announced as Bond. But he proved everyone wrong with his great portrayal. Nice to see some behind the scenes footage of some of his experiences, the stunts and recounting his movies. I really liked his comment about him being related and close to films like Dr No and Live and Let Die. Craig has joined a small elite group of actors who have carried such a great mantle of a timeless character. I am grateful to Craig for helping propel the franchise to the very top in the 21st century and hit some home runs for Bond fans.",False
2,7,"I enjoyed it. 45 mins felt rushed, wish they had more.",TreeFiddy53,n/a,16/08/2025,"The media is generally quick to write people off, to say that XYZ would fail without consideration for the person on the receiving end, even if it's James Bond himself, LOL. Something that all of us can certainly work on.This is a 45 min doc about Daniel Craig's journey from being picked to play Bond to wrapping up the latest movie, No Time To Die. I enjoyed watching this, wish they had more.I had no idea that this dude received so much hate and backlash, especially from the English media. Daniel talks about all of that, how this changed, and how he dealt with being a nobody to being Bond overnight, some of the processes that went into making these movies, never-before-seen clips, etc.Regardless of if he's your Bond guy or not, I would recommend that you check it out. I feel like we tend to appreciate a movie better when there's some behind the scenes insight on the hard work that went into the movie and this will certainly help you look at his Bond movies differently and gear you up for the next one. I'll surely be going a rerun of everything from Casino to Spectre before No Time To Die.",False
3,6,"Being James Bond: The Daniel Craig Story - Insightful But Not Exceptional, 6/10",Zooha-47207,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being James Bond: The Daniel Craig Story earns a 6/10 for its interesting behind-the-scenes glimpse into Daniel Craig's tenure as James Bond. While the documentary provides a fascinating look at his journey, it doesn't quite hit the mark of being truly impressive.The film is engaging for fans interested in the making of the iconic Bond films and Craig's interpretation of the character. It offers a unique perspective on the challenges and triumphs he faced in bringing a new depth to the role. However, despite these intriguing elements, the documentary lacks a certain wow factor that elevates it beyond being just a behind-the-scenes feature.One of the highlights is the intimate and candid moments with Craig, shedding light on his personal experiences and thoughts on playing such a legendary character. These insights add a humanizing touch to the Bond persona, which is compelling for viewers.However, the documentary could have delved deeper into the impact and significance of Craig's portrayal on the Bond legacy. While it's enjoyable to see the backstage aspects and Craig's reflections, the documentary misses an opportunity to explore more profound themes and implications.In conclusion, Being James Bond: The Daniel Craig Story is a decent watch for those interested in the actor's journey as James Bond. It's insightful in parts but overall lacks the depth and impact to make it a standout documentary, hence the 6/10 rating.",False
4,n/a,Worst James Bond in the midst of ultraviolet theme love by those that enjoy it,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't understand why in the hell people love this guy so much, this ultraviolence horrific mutilation of humanity is not what James bond was about neither in the past movies nor the series of books that were written by Fleming. It's just a love affair with mutilation of humanity of a human being. I can't stand watching any of his movies and for years I've only watched one of all of them and he made the other ones I had no interest in if I wanna watch this type of ultra violence stuff I watch Japanese typical yakuza movies not this garbage. I was a fan from the very beginning of the Fleming series of James Bond. But when this guy became the bond and I said hell and then I realize the ultraviolence these days. I'm so happy this guy is gone in a new James Bond is in the coming but for this era of James Bond rest in peace forever and you may you never show up again.",False
5,7,Worried about the future,mikaelkristersson,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe movie was good but I am really worried about the future, can't something be like it always have been? James Bond is 007, James is a man. Basta.",True
6,10,Perfect Set Up for 'No Time To Die',lareval,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's incredibly satisfying to reflect the longest running Bond, after all this time, and to see his first screen test and his very last day on set for the upcoming 'No Time To Die'. As a Bond fan this is a true treat and I hope it even comes as a feature in home video releases. What a legacy, Mr. Craig: you can walk away confidently happy now.",False
7,10,Emotional,shivnarang,n/a,16/08/2025,Damn this was so damn good. He is my favorite Bond no doubt. And now the wait for No Time To Die.,False
8,10,Fantastic treat from Apple,mikeiskorn,n/a,16/08/2025,"With the new film right round the corner, this is a perfect watch to get you in the mood for It. Daniel talks about his time being Bond and we get to see some behind the scenes footage, which was lovely to see. I for one can't wait for the new film! It will be strange to see another person in the role!!",False
9,9,I can't believe I cried at the end...,david_zorrilla,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't believe that I cried hard at the end...
Can you imagine dealing with all that horrible critics and comments and so on and stand up straight and not letting affect you mentally and your work while filming and be able to deliver that kind of performance...hats off!Such an emotional wrap!!... SO inspiring to me as an actor. Thanks!!.(I just would have waited 3 more beats at the end before jumping so hard to the Bond theme though. It felt like a coitus interruptus.)",False
10,3,The victim's journey of one of the wealthiest actors ever.,teamneedle-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe first 10 minutes of this movie does nothing but make Craig out to be a victim. Never on Earth will a professional pretender who makes 50 million per movie ever be a victim. The following 30 minutes doesn't really do anything of worth either.It drones on about how poorly the media treated Craig for a very very short period of time prior to the Broccoli's PR company releasing a picture of him looking very Buff. At that point, the media was 100% team Craig Bond which was what they wanted and paid for, so all was well in the world for them.This is just a fluff PR tv episode length propaganda piece to try and sway people into believing Craig cares about Bond for anything more than money and then asks for you to care about Bond too.Yes, the same Daniel Craig that said he would rather off himself rather than do another Bond movie following the boring Spectre.Yes, the same Bond franchise that created the terrible world of movie product placement that has taken over Hollywood today.The rest of the doc continues to try to make Craig or his movies a victim of writers strikes or on-set accidents.Casino Royale is definitely one of the best action films ever made and Craig, Campbell, and Haggis should all be given props for that, but let's get real... Following Casino Royale, it has been all down hill. Craig's Bond series followed the same trajectory as Brosnan's.I think Daniel Craig is a great actor- I just don't feel bad for him and never will. This ""doc"" isn't worth your time.",True
11,8,This was unexpectedly good,karinahatem,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed watching this documentary, loved the narrative. Nice tribute to the whole James Bond, and yes Daniel did a good job portraying JB especially in the last 3 movies.",False
12,8,Daniel Craig,mmuggi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being James Bond is a nice little feature documentary that sheds light on Daniel Craig's tenure as James Bond. I am personally a big fan of Craig as I think he is the best Bond. Not the most iconic or historic, but arguably Best Bond, especially because he brings something completely new, more down-to-earth and more serious to the table. The documentary follows all the film's productions, as well as the pressure placed on an actor to play James Bond.The documentary gets a little too melancholy in the end, just as I'm also a little sad about its spoiling of the last scene of the latest movie. What the documentary does really well is the inside information we get from producer Barbara Broccoli, producer Michael G. Wilson and Daniel Craig.",False
13,8,The Legacy of this man should never end...,RogueVirus24,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was excited when I got to know about this documentary and I wanted it to be a little longer and the fact that this documentary covers all of the things that have happened in the past only makes me love Daniel Craig's bond more and it really had an impact on the whole bond persona, I honestly think that Craig's bond has more feelings than any other bonds it's like other Bonds are happy to kill and they enjoy it but the depth of Craig's bond is that he does not like it and every time he kills someone he knows it's bad it only gives more depth to the character and the bathroom scene in Casino Royale shows us exactly that he knows how it feels and the fact that Daniel Craig plays Bond is just awesome and I love him for making James Bond look so good doing all the action... What matters is that he enjoyed the role and we enjoyed him play that role and I am grateful that Daniel Craig made me experience the best Bond! And making any movie takes a lot of effort, time, and money it requires patience and dedication you can't just say Quantum of Solace is bad, they tried Casino Royale pushed the standard high that no movie could match it...",False
14,10,This is the James Bond I Grew Up On,jackhime,n/a,16/08/2025,This is one of my favorite Documentaries on the James Bond series and I love it and I love showing some the behind the scenes of all of Daniel Craig films as James Bond and I love this also as an way to show Daniel Craig final chapter as James Bond before No Time To Die (2021),False
15,5,The journey from Daniel Craig's perspective,nwsabir,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before you get a chance to see No Time to Die you will probably want to watch Daniel Craig's Bond story, which is nicely told with inside details especially of interest for the viewers who witnessed this Bond transition.My only complaint was missing interviews/ stories from some of the key cast members.",False
16,9,Best Bond ... my opinion,vkester,n/a,16/08/2025,"Daniel was Bond! All the Bond actors were great, each handled what was given to them and in the TIME it was done. For me, I enjoyed his Bond and all his Bond movies being serious, it put me back into the time first reading Flemming's books. And in my opinion, Daniel is the best Bond. I rated this on what it was, ""Being James Bond"". I would give tens to clips, behind the scenes and bloopers, I enjoy Bond from my first ever reading one of the books, the first Bond movie watched, out of order, no video stores yet, skipped school and went to the movie. Love the block of movies with Daniel C., and all the other actors in them. An outstanding run!",False
17,5,"10/10 If it wasn't a Bond movie, but it is a Bond movie",lando-57742,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNow if this wasn't a Bond movie, this would be flat out a 10/10. The problem is, it is a Bond movie and i simply cannot rate it higher than 5 for that.Now why is that? In itself, you get a great script, great action, great actors, great cinematography, great soundtrack, everything appears to be top notch. Judging this movie alone in itself, it is a great movie and you should absolutely watch it. As long as you don't expect it to be a Bond movie.If you watch a horror movie, you want to get a bit frightened. If you watch a comedy, you want to laugh. Movies come with an expectation and a promise. If you make a movie, that simply does not deliver what it promises, you will disappoint your viewers.Spoilers ahead!Where does this movie break its promises:JB is not a special agent, he is an old man coming out of retirement. Gives you the vibe of an old man's tale, not like watching a superhero special agentThe movie is making you sad, instead of giving you a feel good time like all the Bonds beforeThe movie is a closer to a tragedy, than to an action comedyThey kill Bond - this is not game of thrones, you do not go into bond movies wanting to worry about if he survives, these movies always have happy endsThey kill Felix LeiterThey are ok with showing the abduction of little childsBond is a Family man, many tears, many emotionsThey drag the 007 joke with replacing him with a woman too far. We get it, women can also be strong super heroes, but it felt like they wanted to ride that horse to the death throughout the movie until he finally gets reinstatedMoney Penny, who was developing as a key figure gets thrown back to the sideline with basically no screentime at allThey focussed a lot on the family drama and showing an emotional sideThe movie doesn't have a happy end and ends in a tragedy. I get why they made that decision to end the Craig era, but it Bond floats away in a yacht at the end of movies, this simply leaves a sour tasteNow all these points are completely fine, if this wasn't a bond movie. Just rename him and make another type of spy movie, totally fine, would love to watch that. This just isn't Bond anymore, they took it too far. Yes, Bond stayed at the top because the movies managed to capture the spirit of their time, adjusting to different social environments, but they always stayed true to their core. This movie just throws too much overboard to still be called a Bond movie.It appears that with Daniel Craigs screen death, the James Bond era has also ended. Goodbye and thank you for the good times Mr. Bond. From now on you simply have no idea what to expect from a Bond movie, the brand has basically ended. What will the next Bond be like? Will it be a sad tragedy? Will it be a super hero spy movie? Will he simply die from time to time? Who knows .... they tore down their own brand they had built up over decades.",True

1,10,Extremely interesting!!,sesh-74978,n/a,15/08/2025,"I usually don't get pulled into a documentary, but this one had me from the beginning. Great cinematography and is a very polished production. Kept me engaged the whole time. This type of film is a great way to learn about how things in NJ really worked back then. I enjoyed the specifics of the gambling world and how the state of NJ and NY actually tried to compete with the mafia. You get a vivid picture of how life was in this organized crime era and even details of how deals were done. The construction boom in NJ and the economics at hand highlighted in the film shows how the mafia played an integral role in shaping North Jersey as it is today. I found this as a wonderful history lesson discovering more about NJ and enjoyed learning about the Napoli family. It was refreshing to showcase how this family had more of a positive impact to the community. Definitely interested in learning more and would love to hear more stories within this timeline.",False

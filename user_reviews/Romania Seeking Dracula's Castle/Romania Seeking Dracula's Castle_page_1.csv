1,6,you tube holiday video with a bit of detail,Rob-O-Cop,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's not cinema or anything approaching a serious documentary but there is some research into the topic presented and the presenters are kinda fun.
There's no stunning cinematography, it's all shot on a phone, and the sound is all camera mic, the editing is slapped together in order of shooting.
The overlay map was terribly done, and there isn't really a point, but, it's watchable and the next best thing to going there yourself.",False
2,6,"Transylvania - Romanians' territory for 15,000 years",lucicamimiilie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Transylvania has been first part of Dacia - the kingdom of today's Romanians, then was invaded by the Roman Empire and then by Attila - the ruler of the Huns, today's Hungarians.In contrast to the heterogeneity of the preceding ages, the first Iron Age is remarkable for its homogeneity, which is the result of the emergence and generalization of a new culture displaying black ceramics ornamented with grooves. This cultural homogenization in the First Iron Age represents essentially the material proof of the constitution within the Carpathian Danubian space of the early Geto-Dacians, who are culturally distinguishable from the southern Thracians and the other neighboring peoples. We are told this by the father of history himself-Herodotus. Recounting the Persian king Darius' expedition to the mouth of the Danube in 514 BC he mentions the Getae, praising them for their value.Over 600 sites are known so far across the territory of Transylvania from the First Iron Age. Most sites were occupied during all stages of this epoch. Twenty-six fortifications, some inhabited permanently, others used for refuge and defense in times of peril, are among the more remarkable.During the following centuries the Geto-Dacians would attain a level of development that would lead them to form a state.",False
3,9,Great travel documentary,Tostig66,n/a,16/08/2025,"This has a little something for everyone. At the heart of it it is a journey to try and find the real historical sites of Vlad the Impaler. However, there is a discussion between fact and legend. There are insights into Bram Stoker's Dracula novel. And also tours of various other sites in Romania. Some I've never even heard of.It's a fun documentary and the husband and wife between behind it are clearly having a ball.",False
4,8,"Simply Shot, Well Presented",Travelenthusiast,n/a,16/08/2025,"Simply shot on handheld cameras and drones, and no outside crew, this show resembles Ewan Mcgregor's travel shows more than something like Palin's travels with a full crew.I found that this added to the experience. The presenters really bring you along with you, and confide their thoughts and confusion about Dracula and his role as hero or villain in history.There are times when the sound could be improved, but it didn't detract for me. Hopefully they can improve it for their next video, which I'll keep an eye out for.",False
5,9,Romania: Seeking a success,h_pereiraiow,n/a,16/08/2025,"Romania: Seeking Dracula's castle is a modest, fun, sometimes relatable (holiday parking!) and informative documentary.Following the journey of husband and wife team Greg and Felicity, we are transported to Romania. The show is a good balance of both travel blog and historic documentary. Both presenters are eloquent and really bounce off of each other which adds to the overall genuine/honest feel of the documentary.They stick to the facts but keep it enjoyable to the last. They are also not afraid of being honest about their journey and their feelings towards the subject matter.The mix of hand held shots and drone footage brings together a production that is both raw and professional. I would like to see more from these two.",False
6,10,An insite full documentary,solair130,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed watching this. It was well done, great information, and something I would love to see more of.
Keep up the hard work, we NEED to see more of these, No pressure.",False
7,10,Inspirational and Educational,jcchapman-20322,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have watched many travel documentaries, which often give facts and nice camera shots, but this one goes a step further! You feel as though you are walking in the footsteps of the couple, almost as though you are being gifted a private guided tour! Great facts delivered in a fun, entertaining way and lots of humour too! The couple have certainly done their research and I have learned so much! It has certainly made me want to travel here myself!I hope this isn't a one-off documentary as I would love to see and hear the next adventures of this couple!",False
8,8,Enjoyable documentary with an enjoyable couple,Masterplans,n/a,16/08/2025,For an amateur production this is very well done.Cinematography and camera work are excellent including spectacular drone footage of stunning scenery. The couple is enjoyable to watch and their enthusiasm comes through. They are knowledgeable and naturally adventurous but also relatable.Audio can be a challenge occasionally as the narration is sometimes lost in background noise but it is a small complaint. Would gladly see their other offerings.,False
9,9,Loved this!,mazzianne,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this twice, really refreshing and insightful and at the same time we all learned some stuff. The kids really liked it, especially our son Max who enjoyed all of it and found himself chuckling at the funny bits.
The way this is filmed gives you chance to absorb the facts and the chillier side to the legends. It's great how both the fictional and the fact are explored together and the scenery was just stunning, the snow too! And more from the drone please!!",False
10,10,You guys are fun!,leahdfeliciano,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really felt like I was getting a great personal one on one tour. I love the quick witty humor and compassionate personalities of Greg and Felicity. I laughed out loud when Greg put on his shoes just like Vlad did with his horseshoe trick!!Even if some things were closed, you were able to transit and find another place to go. That dinosaur park seems super fun and the ride up the mountain actually made me cringe"" Felicity:be careful greg. Greg:I am"" so calmly. So great, love it!!I'd enjoy watching more of you guys, keep up the good work, the drone footage was amazing!! Thank you for making me smile

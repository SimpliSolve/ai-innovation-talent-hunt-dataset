2,10,A Must See!,arfdawg-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Plot:
The film investigates how Disney promotes social causes and sexuality in kids' content. It features analysis by experts on the politics of the formerly family-friendly brand and the effects on children.What a great unbiased documentary. When I was kid, Disney products were those parents could trust. Whether on TV, in the movies or at the theme parks.Today it's a corporation of groomers and agenda pushing people. Walt would be spinning in his grave.Disney parks have disintegrated too. There was a day when people who dressed proclitically weren't allowed in the park. Now if you complain about the inappropriates at the park they will ban YOU.This is truly a great, revealing, documentary. A must see for anyone who wants the truth!!!",False

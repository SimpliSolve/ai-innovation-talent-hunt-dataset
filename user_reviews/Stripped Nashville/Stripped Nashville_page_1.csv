1,6,None of these women are gross...,ulrike-23,n/a,16/08/2025,"They are beautiful and work hard. They have their stories... and I, for one, found these stories interesting. Especially in view of the fact that almost all of them actually dream of a different career, I also thought it was brave of them to come out as strippers. ...
Is this documentary mindblowing in any way?Certainly not.It stays far too much on the surface and doesn't get close enough to its protagonists. But it is a reminder of how many women work precariously and in insecure conditions, how many obstacles they encounter and how they still try to do a good job.For anyone considering a similar job, there is interesting information on the special Nashville regulations for strip clubs on the side: could prove useful :-)",False
2,2,It's not what I expected,bparone,n/a,16/08/2025,"I live in Nashville and thought it would be interesting to watch a bunch of hot girls dancing and seeing what goes on in the city's underbelly. Boy, was I disappointed. First of all, all the girls are absolute white trash dogs. I can't believe anyone would pay to watch THESE women strip because they're gross. They give the 'wash your hands if you touch them' vibe. Their stories are boring and exactly as you'd expect for someone in this sort of business. They all have lunatic religious zealot backgrounds which, again, is the least surprising thing you could expect. Boring boring boring boring and predictable.",False

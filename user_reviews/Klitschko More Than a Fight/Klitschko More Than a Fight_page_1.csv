1,8,"A fascinating insight, cut several rounds short.",alexg24,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having sat through several disappointing Sky original documentaries and films, my hopes for this were not very high.Juxtaposing a boxing career with the current conflict could easily come across as corny and vulgar, but Macdonald does a good job of making it work.I, although not personally affected, have followed the war from its outset and had a substantial knowledge of the area, however there were things here I did not know.I found Klitschko's family history, his father's involvement in Chernobyl and the animosity between the current president and former boxer of particular interest.This being said, this would definitely have been better suited as a mini series, further involving his brother. The boxing career highlights were so severely cut short, I feel the director could have dedicated one episode to boxing, one to his transition into politics and a third on the current conflict.Just like Klitschko's fight with Lennox Lewis, this one was brought to an end prematurely.",False
2,10,Ignore the Russian Bots,Mehla84,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a unique documentary about the brothers, and their involvement before and during the invastion of Ukraine. Exciting to see the politics and defence of Kyiv.An inspiring and honest view about the politicians, the military and the citizens of Kyiv. The impressive story about how they defended the city and chased the russians out of the city.Again, a documentary that puts Putin and his war-dogs in a bad light, and rightfully so. Everyone should watch this documentary. Not only as a war-time, political documentary, but also as a documentary about the fantastic rise of the boxing champions they were.",False

1,9,"Really like the show, the narrator however ...",scmathisen98037-92-424311,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love zoo shows, but the narrator's voice and inflections drove me crazy.",False
2,10,Love this show,Icestarfish-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the first show in a long time I haven't check my phone the entire time. I admit I am a Disney person but I don't love going to Animal Kingdom. This show brings a whole new view to the park that I never imagined and I can't wait to go back on my next trip. I cannot believe the lengths these people go through to give these animals the best lives possible. I also don't watch Animal Planet so I don't have anything to compare the pace of this show to except for IMAX films, so it's perfect for me. I highly recommend this for people of all ages. I hope we get more more seasons of this show soon.",False
3,6,tedious,happy_quadruped,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know what it is about this show, but it's just so much more tedious than many of the other zoo shows on Nat Geo. The storytelling is super basic and the narrator is aggravating.Seems like they have a lot of cool animals in the Disney theme park but they haven't figured out how to package it.",False

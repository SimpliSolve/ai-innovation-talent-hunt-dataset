1,10,Backyard animals are suffering less?,IoanIacob,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is the first of its kind in Romania and it presents the situation of farmed animals (cows, chicken, pigs, fish), it questions the ethics behind using and eating animals, it presents the health benefits and the health risks when eating dairy, animal flesh and bird ovulations.We can see the bad and the ugly part of rural Romania in its truest forms.We owned the traditions from our parents, grandparents, never asking why.The pace of the documentary is slow, the music is self-made, the angles and the way of recording is unusual, original. It is an expose, after all.It is heartbreaking, thrilling, interesting, it will make you cry!10 stars from me!",False

1,4,Very disappointing,grantss,n/a,16/08/2025,"A 2022 Netflix stand-up comedy special hosted by Bill Burr. Guests include Jimmy Carr, Jeff Ross, Dave Atell and Josh Meyers.Being a Bill Burr fan I had high hopes for this special. His previous Netflix specials have been great and surely this would be in a similar vein. Unfortunately, this special is nothing like those previous ones.Firstly, it's not just Bill Burr: it's him hosting a bunch of other comedians. Some of the other comedians, e.g. Jimmy Carr and Jeff Ross, are pretty good in their own right, and if Burr is hosting this we should expect a similar brand and quality of humour to his, right?Unfortunately, no. Bill Burr starts the trend with a fairly flat opening set, going in directions that were bound to polarise, if not disengage, the audience. The remaining performances are all largely unfunny, with the comedians going for shock value over humour. There's a reason many of them are unknowns...Even Jimmy Carr resorts to one-liners with no connection between the individual jokes, though his one-liners are at least reasonably funny, elevating him above the pack.The highlight would have to be Jessica Kirson's impression of what millennials sound like. It's quite hysterical but many viewers will miss it as they will have given up by then.",False
2,4,Pretty Bad,kwhyell,n/a,16/08/2025,This was pretty bad... not 1/10 stars like everyone is rating it but still pretty bad. There was a funny joke every now and then but mostly cringe. Ian Edwards was funny.,False
3,6,Half of good and half of bad,MasturbationProcess,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know what really was a purpose of this show, but somehow it seemed like it was half assed or just improvised on a go. At the beginning we got really great stand up sketches by Burr and Wolf and after that the comedy show felt inconsistent with every other act following. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. The occasional reminder of covid felt tired and some of the other comedians just didn't fit in with Burrs energy and concept of comedy which might feel deceitful for viewers who might expect something similar. Don't get me wrong, some of the acts where amazingly good as long as they lasted, but the other half just felt out of place. For whatever it's worth, I'd still recommend for giving it a try.",False
4,2,Awful beyond compare,Kol88,n/a,16/08/2025,"Honestly I haven't watch anything this bad in a while, I love Bill Burr listen to his podcast regularly and he is good, he didn't do much in this one, he was more of a announcer for others, but my oh my the others, the others were so bad so unwatchable, so unfunny that it was like looking at train accident waiting to happen. Jokes were plain and boring, Jimmy Carr that I also really like and had watch every other of his special was just awkward and unpleasant, his part was so off that the audience didn't react to his jokes and it was just that feeling of please someone make it stop. And the worst thing about this kind of shows is that it makes me like Stan in South Park, episode where nothing is funny to him, whole time I'm thinking why, why is the audience laughing when nothing is funny, granted audience didn't laugh that much to begin with so my guess is that they were just laughing out of courtesy or they were paid to laugh no other rational explanation. Just skip this it's only a one hour long but it feels like it's 3 or 4 hours because it's that bad. Washing dishes for one hour is more entertaining than this, and I'm not kidding. The only reason I gave this 2 is because it's like a number 2.",False
5,1,The reviews are more entertaining than the special.,johnfiallo-37050,n/a,16/08/2025,"I pray that whoever is reading this hasn't already wasted an hour of their life. Please, just read the reviews. I have to hit 150 characters. Go watch Ricky Gervais. Do anything else. It is so bad.",False
6,1,Fan of Bill but...,prask-65396,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was painfully unfunny, I was shocked to see so many failed routines in a row... I swear they needed to add laugh tracks, and the audience still felt underwhelmed.. Should be called ""Friends Who Bomb""",False
7,n/a,Cringefest,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Bill burr needs new friends. A total waste of time and you can sense the uneasiness and discomfort of the live audience. Worst Netflix special I've ever watched.,False
8,6,Pretty bad,247buffmovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"Burr was okay, can't believe comments saying jimmy carr wasn't funny, he was hilarious, I don't think the American audience appreciated him. The others, were a tough watch. I'll forgive you bill.",False
9,1,Get in the bin,cimex-15004,n/a,16/08/2025,"Firstly I'll just say I'm a Bill Burr fan. But... I just discovered someone called Steph Tolev on this who is one of the least funny comedians I've experienced. She makes clich√© vagina ""jokes"" and her actions and noises made me physically cringe in my chair. The rest is just awful including a guy who sings an immature song that 12 year olds wouldn't find funny.",False
10,6,Meh.....lukewarm but not totally cold.,gina_gemini,n/a,16/08/2025,"I expected more from Bill Burr. The only thing some of these comedians managed to kill was the laughter, especially the better known ones, with the exception of Jimmy Carr.The lesser known comics were kinda better, some had a weak start but managed to win me over at the end of their set, e.g. Jessica Kirson.",False
11,2,Pure cringe not a single laugh,ianas,n/a,16/08/2025,"How could so many commics not be funny, you'd think out of 7 or 8 acts there be a single funny comedian you'd be wrong, to be honest the British guy made me chuckle but that was too little.Avoid.",False
12,8,Great comedians,mmain708,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never seen such an awful audience. They killed the vibe of every single act.The comedians did well, at least way better than the reviews here would say. But you got the impression they were about to throw the mic at an audience who brought zero energy collectively.",False
13,6,A generous 6,colbymroberts,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was pretty good at the start and then seemed hit or miss as the show goes on. You kinda start to lose your attention span towards the end.Good Comedians:
Burr
Wolf
Carr
Edwards.",False
14,1,What happened Billy boy?,altdefty,n/a,16/08/2025,Bill Burr Presents: Friends who bomb.......Not one good set in the whole special.Do yourself a favour and skip this drek.Netflix truly IS a joke.,False
15,1,I expected better from Bill Burr,hassellme,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like Bill Burr and think he's funny so I expected a funny show. With the exception of Bill Burr's opening - there was nothing funny. The other ""comedians"" were just not funny and the band near the end? The guy singing a Katy Perry song - Wth? I'm seriously disappointed in Bill Burr, they must have paid him a lot to risk his reputation to link it to this garbage.",False
16,2,Bill Burr Presents: The Death of Stand-Up,julianmarku,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I saw this show I heard nothing about it, no reviews, no trailers, nothing. I only knew Bill Burr so I expected a little entertainment and... having watched 85% of it (thank you Netflix for the Skip button) I can say that it is trash. Except for a few crumbs here and there of Bill and Jimmy, I can safely say that this show feels like it was tailor made for a Los Angeles crowd meaning completely safe and unfunny.Somewhere between the dad jokes and the groomer I was like: ""this show is garbage, I hope you got paid in full Bill for attaching your name to this Amber Heard show"".",False
17,1,Brutal,lelliott7,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. Everyone was bad. I kept holding out hope someone would be funny. But everyone sucked.You'll be better off just skipping this even if there's comedians in here you love, you'll like them less after watching this.",False
18,n/a,"Wow, that is BAD",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Burr will hate himself for making this absolute s*** show full of has-been's and never-will-be-anything's.'Steph Tolev' is legitimately the worst comedian I've ever seen, this is even worse than Amy Schumer talking constantly about her V and I thought after Michelle Wolf we already reached a good ground level of despair and being miserable.After that we're ""gifted"" with Jeff Ross and another has-been roasting each other on the stage and random people in the audience and I just stopped and deleted this crap.I'd give zero stars but this is not possible, 0/10.",False
19,6,Not sure what everyone else is on about,dangiven,n/a,16/08/2025,Shocked to see all the one star reviews. Jimmy Carr wasn't at his funniest and Dave Attell didn't look well but it was pretty solid. The band at the end was terrible but I laughed at each comic especially some of the females I hadn't heard of before.,False
20,2,Comedy for Californians.,swordsnare,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fiends who kill Comedy, should have been the title. Much like everyone, being a fan of Bill Burr prompted me to click on it. Even Jimmy Carr's performance made his last standup special look like a masterpiece. Ronny Chieng got up and sang?The two stars reflected the number of times I ""chuckled"" throughout this special. I'd give this a wide berth.",False
21,6,Not as bad as the reviews! 6-7/10,gwest-58160,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow so many bad reviews! This is a 6-7/10 for me. Although there were a couple of dud performances, all the other performances made me laugh out loud multiple times. Try it yourself.",False
22,1,What. Was. That!!!??,timlittman3506,n/a,16/08/2025,"So it's June 6th and this is the worst thing I've seen this year. So far. For the love of god, do not watch this. You have been warned!!!! Not one funny joke from any of the acts. Jimmy Carr was diabolical!!",False
23,10,Softies,wreckonize-26277,n/a,16/08/2025,"I Swear, These People Are Sensitive And The Reason They Dont Like It Is Beacause They Attack Sensitive People. If You Like Bill Burr, You Know What Youre in For. Bad Ratings Are GREAT For The Elites!",False
24,6,Bill Burr and Funny Friends,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not a huge fan of comedy showcases. This one is very good. Bill Burr is the headliner and excelled. Dave Atell and Jeff Ross also excellent. I loved Michelle Wolf. The are funny, but not as good. This is a Netflix Is a Joke special. Worth watching.",False
25,1,Bill Burr presents : friends who make you cringe,blazekmat,n/a,16/08/2025,"I created my account just so I can give this trash 1 star. I'am a long time fan of Bill, but this is Amy Schumer level of cringe. With the exception of Jimmy Carr, they were all just bunch of pandering edgelords trying way to hard and failing miserably.",False

1,8,Awesome Gruesome,indeevar,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nicely crafted movie with exceptional performances by Vijay Sethupathi and Anurag Kashyap. Engaging from the first scene itself. Mamta Mohandas has been underutilised. Abirami is impressive though for a short time. Casting was excellent.I need to watch it again, as I still have one question that was unanswered. Watching in a theatre was great because of a very appropriate background score. It's cinematic brilliance at its best.This is one movie where gore needed to be allowed to drive home a certain point (unlike animal). Strikes a very deep chord as you think hard, long after the movie is over.",False
2,7,"Apt use of ""Subversion""",SoumikBanerjee1996,n/a,15/08/2025,"It has been a long time since I have witnessed a script that utilizes the technique of ""subversion"" so tactfully. The initial half cleverly diverges into various paths with not just one, but three distinct plotlines running parallel to each other.Even though Initially you might find yourself quite confused, struggling to comprehend the purpose of it all.However, rest assured, all your confusion will be dissipated and your queries will be addressed at appropriate times, which specifically transpires in the latter portion of the second half.And trust me, the final act will astonish you and leave you profoundly moved.Now I will refrain from revealing anything more to avoid any inadvertent spoilers, though I will say this; if you are a seasoned viewer, well-versed in ""foreign cinema"", you might be able to anticipate the concluding twist from afar.On the contrary, if you are fresh to this particular genre or lack exposure to ""World Cinema,"" brace yourself for an unforgettable revelation!P. S. Kashyap maybe going through tough times as a 'director', but as an 'actor' he continues to evolve with each character he commits himself to. He nailed his role here, especially in the last ten minutes, that will certainly leave a mark!",False

4,10,Every cinepile should watch it!,gsvasu2006,n/a,15/08/2025,"Maharaja (2024) Tamil movie Review: All I knew was that this movie is from the director of ""Kurangu Bommai"" that had been released in 2017, though it was a good thriller it didn't do that well. This is Nithilan Swaminathan's second movie after a gap of seven years. However, you get a feeling that this 50th movie or so of this already veteran director. Also, this one is in fact 50th movie of Vijay Sethupathi whose fan I had become after watching his initial movies starting from ""Pizza"". This one should be a case study of how screen play of movie should be written taking simplest of stories and how characters should be developed in the script. Any movie would be great if it doesn't allow you to guess what is going to happen next? The suspense should not only be edge of the seat, but it should have many wow moments that is beyond audience's wildest imagination. Also, it should be more than engrossing and not just that, it should take you along as the story unfolds on the screen. In such a way that you end up feeling that you are part of what is happening. Finally, it should make you think long after you return home. Maharaja does all that and becomes one of the best Tamil movies of this year and the best 50th movie for Vijay Sethupathi. Take a bow to the director Nithilan Swaminathan for creating magic with amazing screen play from a simple story. You will think it is just another simple story only when you get to decipher the complete plot of this amazing movie. And you may have to see this movie more than once to get everything that you witnessed in the first view. I am really glad that this movie just came when everyone thought Malayalam movies are doing great even with Tamil audience and everyone started asking, what had happened to Tamil movie makers as they couldn't cater to the requirement of Tamil speaking audience? So much was the impact that old movies were re-released in the theaters due to lack of any good new movies to compete with Malayalam to Tamil dubbed movies. Technically this movie is brilliant in all ways. The major technical success is the wonderful BGM by Ajaneesh Loknath of KGF fame. I always associate him with loud BGM that not only vibrates chairs of theater also makes you buy a bottle of Amurthanjan/Headache balm. However, this one is an exception and crisp editing by Philomin Raj. Coming to performances, Vijay Sethupathi stands out both playing the younger version (Whom I like most) and the older version with good make up and even mannerism. You will feel nostalgic about his character in the movie ""naduvula konjam pakkatha kaanom"". It is nice to see Anurag Kashyap's amazing performance though there is no lip sync at many places. That is just a minor glitch as you can't think of anyone else in that role. However, taking a comedian and make him play one of the lead bad guys speaks volumes about the director. Singampuli is just amazing, and you start hating him to the core. I can't take all the names as it would make this review still longer one. Yes, you can't forget the girl who plays Vijay Sethupathi's daughter in this movie. This one is one amazing movie of this year and perfect choice for Vijay Sethupathi's 50th movie. Very Highly recommended. Every Cinephile should watch this one.My rating is solid 10/10.One humble request :- Please don't reveal about the plot to anyone. Let everyone watch it and experience it themselves!",False
5,10,Indian Cinema at its best!,mehta-1010,n/a,15/08/2025,"Maharaja is one of the finest films of recent times! After a long time such good cinema is made in India. We can consider this one of the cult classics of Indian Cinema! The performances are good the direction is good and the script is just mind blowing! You are hooked to the film throughout! The non linear story telling also makes this a superb watch! Vijay Sethupathi as always has not failed to impress the audience. The most surprising performance is of Mr. Anurag Kashyap, he was very good in the role. There is a point in the film where you feel you have lost hope but then again some twist comes and you are back to normal. Full marks to the director Nithilan Swaminathan for making such good film!!",False
6,8,Screenplay Masterclass. I have NOT seen anything written like this in Tamil cinema before.,TreeFiddy53,n/a,15/08/2025,"Isaignani Ilaiyaraja avargal, after this movie:
Naan sivanenu dhaane poiki'irundhen....

Screenplay Masterclass. I have NOT seen anything written like this in Tamil cinema before.Any details about the plot may potentially reveal spoilers so I'll refrain from doing so. Vijay Sethupathi and Anurag Kashyap were GREAT (minus the lip-sync) along with the secondary characters. Any actor could have played these roles, from the Nassers to the SJ Suryas; but the screen presence that these two have elevates the scenes and the brand of the movie that will make people buy the tickets; and rightfully so - because a film like this deserves to be seen by many.But to put the actors ABOVE the script and the screenplay would be blasphemous. VJS will likely get over-credited for this movie and that's fine as long the writing gets the most props for this film. It would be an injustice otherwise.Is everything a 100% perfect? No. But the brilliance that the writing has demonstrated overshadows that things that didn't work for me along with a couple of the casting choices didn't have any impact on the plot. Could have been anybody, and folks who were chosen didn't add to the screen presence either. However this is not the movie to nitpick on.Go in blank, sit back and watch things unfold. You have not seen anything like this before. If you're a cinema lover, you're in for a special treat with the screenplay.",False

Nithilan's guts to blend humor in this serious subject is just amazing.U dont even know whats gonna happen next. The Interval ends with a high, leaving many questions within u. The pre-climax and the climax will answer u.Missing this film in theatres is the worst thing u can ever do this year.So Go watch Maharaja NOW!",False
9,10,Hats off,as-02105,n/a,15/08/2025,No one can think to write like this story and more over it is a Oscar winning movie one who denies to give the award he is not human being and all credits goes to the crew each actors gave their best. The more interesting part is the footprint 👣 of the child which is given in the chain that is unbelievable the team contribution to the movie is so amazing each and every character in the movie was fabulous. The vision is put perfectly in the screen play and the movie elevation from the second off was amazing and the climax was such a rocking performance it was. I believe this movie is gonna surprise for the cinema industry.,False
10,7,"Too gruesome, brilliant screenplay",harineem-209-525488,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie should be rated Adults only. Its too gruesome and has some very distrubing scenes. The fact that it got U/A tells Indian movie board censor board is non-existent. What the hell were they thinking giving this U/A? The subject and story all of it is very adult.Yes the screenplay is brilliant with the twists and turns. First 30-40 mins drags but once it picks pace, keeps it going. I loved the way they ended the arc of the girl child. There are some great performances in the movie.I just dont understand why are such vivid violence movies being made now. You could have conveyed everything without showing such crudeness.Overall its a good idea and concept to show, you cant escape your crimes and they will visit you where you least expect it.",False
11,8,The hype is real: VJS 50th is a banger with a twisted-emotional climax!!,samxxxul,n/a,15/08/2025,"Despite being critical of Vijay Sethupathi's filmography in the past (including Mugizh, 2021), I can confidently say Maharaja strikes a chord of undeniable brillaince for his 50th golden jubilee offering.There's so much to unpack in this film,
I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything, but major props to Sethupathi. He deserves a standing ovation for embodying the director's vision. The complexities, the writing is a no nonsense game which gets it right with a brilliant climax that lingers long after the credits roll. The first half features familiar faces from the director's debut, with lighthearted moments woven into the theft investigation, the police station chaos, and the antics of ""Kurangu Bommai,"" the burglar sidekick. Character introductions are swift, establishing VJS's family life, daughter, PT teacher role, the city's robbery, and the presence of Anurag Kashyap (whose dubbing might raise an eyebrow, but his performance shines in the climactic construction site sequence). For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I'll refrain from detailing his henchman's significance.Ajanessh Loknath, a powerhouse known for his work in Kannada and Telugu cinema is the perfect musical accompaniment for this movie.Director Nithilan Swaminathan, who stunned audiences with his debut ""Kurangu Bommai,"" showcases his mastery of non-linear storytelling, solidifying him as a rising force in Tamil cinema. His mastery of non-linear storytelling is brilliant. He's on track to be a big name in Tamil cinema.There's just so much to this movie, but for now, I gotta recommend it if you're looking for something deeper than just a masala popcorn flick. Sure, some might compare the climax to stuff like Oldboy or Irrata, or even Villeneuve's Incendies (2010), but don't let that stop you. Ignore the overzealous puluthis who act like they've seen it all - this is one you don't want to miss.Bonus recommendation! Rishab Shetty has produced a movie titled Shivamma which has released today, just came out, and if you're into indie films, you should check it out. Support the indies!",False
12,7,A cleverly written non-linear script.,radiantfractal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched the movie in Hindi. Won't say it's flawless, there is one gaping plot-hole and there are other goof-ups too but on the whole, it's an excellent attempt at a different kind of non-linear story-telling. The script is very cleverly written and that is the highlight of the movie. Like an initial scene of the movie is explained completely only in the last scene! The story unfolds spirally, layer by layer - stuff that you have seen previously, keeps getting newer meanings as the movie progresses. The movie's worth a watch to experience that narrative-style that's not common in Indian movies.",False
13,10,Whole movie is perfect,Ujwal_B,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is mixture of two timeline where they managed to sync it with perfect screenplay. They also magically shot the movie in such a way that the audience tends to sit for whole time until the end of movie. No doubt about Vijay sir, he did fantastic jobs. Talking about the script....hats off to Nithilan Swaminathan. The way he portrayed it, it takes a lot of imagination and planning. The supporting also did fantastic job. In this film the director haven't wasted time in slow mo shots or entry shots like other movies everything is picture perfect. Once again it's a master piece for those audience who know what should be called a movie.",False
14,8,Another Sethupathi show,appusnikhil,n/a,15/08/2025,"A must watch movie. What an acting from Vijay Sethupathy. The story, screenplay and the overall making is just outstanding. All the characters were perfectly apt for their respective roles. Anuarag Kashyap also deserves a huge applause for his performance.The story is well written and the screenplay was also solid. I don't share the same opinion about the climax because a similar theme have been used in movies all around the world and recently there was a movie from Mollywood which had a similar theme in the ending. I'm not saying the climax was boring, it was great, but it didn't have much impact for me. That doesn't mean it won't work for everyone. Do give it a go. Overall the move is pure class!",False

The smooth transition in narrating the past and the present is just brilliant and will be a reference point for future film makers. Credits go to the screen play writer here. VJS what an acting, simply brilliant. Surprise element is the short comedian turned villain, he is going to be the most hated person after this movie so watch out. In short everything was brilliant just watch it you and you will love it.

18,10,Thriller at its best,vedantchoudhary,n/a,15/08/2025,"With slow start and weird demands, it appears that this movie is totally confused. Later many parallel stories started, which added up the confusion .... But this movie rewards a patient viewer. The moment all dots started connecting, movie reaches to a new level. And the climax (though slightly predictable in last 10 min) is just wow. Excellent acting skill shown by Vijay Sethupati .. he was very intense. All supporting actors were good.It also have very good direction. The narrative can be slightly better as it creates lots of confusion in first half. But again the same confusion turns in thrill.Hats off to the makers and actors .",False
19,7,Engaging Non-Linear Thriller,jotheeswaran,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a connoisseur of thriller films, I found this feature to be quite the entertaining piece. The plot unfolds predictably with clues peppered throughout, allowing you to anticipate the twists from the onset. What sets this film apart is its adept use of non-linear storytelling, which compensates for the predictability and keeps you hooked. A notable departure from genre norms is the absence of an in-depth explanatory segment, which leaves some mystery intact. While the protagonist carries the narrative effectively, other characters, including the antagonist, lack substantial presence. Overall, it's worth watching.",False
20,8,"Beyond the Dustbin: The Real Significance of ""Lakshmi""",akilainduruwa,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIn the movie, Lakshmi is mentioned repeatedly, and it's clear that it's not just about the dustbin. It seemed like he was referring to people who harmed his daughter, affecting her deeply. Even though I don't understand Tamil, the movie hints through a police officer that Lakshmi could symbolize something precious, like a daughter or a wife. In South Indian culture, this could imply a woman's virginity. So, he was seeking justice for what happened to his daughter. The pain in his eyes whenever he said ""Lakshmi Sir, Lakshmi"" was evident, thanks to Vijay Sethupathi's outstanding acting. The dustbin named Lakshmi was a plot device to mislead the audience, allowing for a surprising twist at the end.Overall, it's a great movie with many layers to explore. Vijay Sethupathi deserves special credit for his performance.However, I gave it 8 stars because I believe the girl is not his daughter. Early in the movie, Maharaja drops a statue of a mother and daughter, suggesting this. Also, the character of Aasifa seemed unnecessary as a lead character.",True
21,6,Maharaja 2024 - Unconvincing Twists and Overloaded Gimmicks,tenmawakaikomi,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMaharaja tried knitting all its holes with a cliché climax twist. The director may have been inspired by Lokesh Kanagaraj's Vikram, thinking that the trick to cheating the audience is showing something that convinces their novelty-seeking mindset.The screenplay is fully loaded with cinematic gimmicks and violence, making it irrelevant for dramatic storytelling.Here I quote a particular scene from the movie: While searching for someone, Maharaja ends up in a godown-like place and is surrounded by thugs. Guess what? He fights the entire crew and beheads the boss. WTF am I watching? Theri starring Vijay?Regarding Anurag Kashyap's part, as a serial robber, he and his assistant also irrelevantly kill and rape the victims. But why?The crucial part where everything about the story begins is when Anurag returns after around 10-15 years of imprisonment for all those series of murders, robberies, and rapes to seek vengeance. But for all those years and even after, it seems he doesn't give a thought to his unwaveringly lovely daughter. Ah.... what a close-to-reality scenario?Though Vijay Sethupathi and Singam Puli delivered good performances, Maharaja's screenplay is just a row of beans that actually deceives the audience.The ironic portrayal of the protagonist as both the guy next door and someone who can fight, kill, and deceive the police raises the doubt of whether the screenplay has been influenced by the mainstream market.Apart from all this, Maharaja is technically well-built and deserves applause for its cinematography.",True
22,1,Don't believe the hype,samsmiler-91682,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this movie because a friend recommended it. I love movies with a plot twist. 15 minutes into the movie I got serious doubts if it was worth continuing to watch it, but I figured if there's a good plot twist at the end, it makes it worth it. Maybe they will make it come together in a way that really baffles my mind. But that never happened. The story is incoherent, there's so many things that don't make sense, And the only surprising moment I experienced sort of whole movie where when I asked myself ""What the heck did the writers think?"" It's as if a 14 year old wrote a screenplay. And that great final plot twist? I saw it coming a mile away, and i was hoping ""please don't let it be that"". Of course it was exactly that.",False

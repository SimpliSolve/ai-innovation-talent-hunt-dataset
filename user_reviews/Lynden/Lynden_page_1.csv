1,10,Reality of our divided nation is unsettling,marileejolin-35318,n/a,15/08/2025,"This compelling documentary follows the efforts of a 17-year-old Black girl to organize a Black Lives Matter march in her small, conservative, evangelical Christian town of Lynden, WA. But this is not a one-sided portrayal. The filmmakers deeply explore the beliefs of both the BLM protesters, the gun-toting counter-protesters, the religious leaders, and others in this tiny, white, complicated town. It's a microcosm of what is happening in the US on the national stage. It is deeply uncomfortable, provocatively insightful, oddly hopeful and all around beautiful. Everyone who lives and votes in the US needs to see this film.",False
2,10,"Troubling, hopeful, beautiful documentary",Peebot,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to see the premier of this beautiful movie recently in Seattle and cannot recommend it highly enough. It takes on an intense, devisive conversation with grace, openness and a yearning to listen as well as to educate and inform.The film is beautifully photographed, extremely well paced, and punctuates its intense storyline with humor and pathos. It is a shame that many of the people who have already made their mind up about this story will likely refuse to watch it, because I was very impressed with the filmmakers sense of balance in this tricky narrative. Highly recommended!",False
3,10,A snapshot of our time,kerrilsloan,n/a,15/08/2025,"The filmmakers have captured the essence of some key struggles facing our country, and reflected in communities and families everywhere. It would be amazing to see this on a National distribution platform. Must-see watching in the lead up to the election.Amsa is a compelling protagonist who tells her story in an honest, straightforward way. She is completely likable, generating my support versus my sympathy.The filmmakers give a lot of space to the question of how a small, predominantly Christian town reconciles the diverging positions of its citizenry. What happens when you find out you don't know your neighbors as well as you thought you did? When everyone discovers some uncomfortable truths about themselves or their people. When someone shows their vulnerability and receives aggression or disdain instead of compassion.We were lucky enough to attend a viewing in Bellingham, with one of the Directors and Amsa in attendance for a Q&A afterwards. It was fascinating to learn that the videographer who was recording the activists on the other side allowed their footage to be incorporated into the documentary. Provides insights into both perspectives of shared events.Highly recommend, should this worthy independent film find its way to the larger market.",False
4,10,A Snapshot of Small Town Division,jknobe,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lynden offers an incredible snapshot of the realities of the polarized climate in small-towns across the country. The film primarily follows the experiences of Ethiopia-born Amsa Burke, who was adopted by a white family in Lynden, a predominently white, Christain town in Northwest Washington. The film focuses on Amsa's efforts to bring awareness to racial injustice and the racism she has experienced as within her rural community. In doing this, the filmakers also follow the narrative of another Lynden local, Wylin, who films supplemental footage so that 'the liberal media won't twist the narrative.'
While we see the two sides of the polarized divide, the filmmakers also engaged with local community leaders (pastors, shop owners, civilians.) who are grappling with the outcomes of Lynden's (deeply divided) march for social justice, some of whom are spurred into further action for this phase of the Civil Rights Movement within their own community, and others who choose to ignore it in favor of their Christian, nationalistic values.Lynden offers a poingant picture of the relaities facing the current American divide and offers hope in the strength and courage of some of our youngest civilans and activists.",False
5,10,A Deeper Look into the Politics of Small American Towns,bridgetgrace-58805,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a story about Amsa Burke, a brave 17 year old who sought to make a change in the town she was adopted and moved to from Ethipoia when she was just 4 years old. But it is also a movie about so much more. Throughout the film, Amsa shares moving personal experiences of racism, hate, and microaggressions she personally experienced while she grew up in this predominately white community. Amsa, and many others mentioned and shown in the film, didn't want to leave town as soon as they could without trying to change it first. In 2020 she did this so by leading a March for Black Lives in an attempt to create awareness for the injustices happening around the country that directly affect us all, but especially minorities; such as but not limited to people of color and lgbtqia+ communities. Motivated primarily to make a difference for the younger children of color she saw growing up in the town around her.The people who oppose Amsa and the rest of the marchers who Marched for Black Lives, were mostly kind hearted Christian small town folks who do things like lead dance groups, work at churches, run small businesses, etc. Normal small town people who like their small town the way it is. It's safe, for them. As many of them stand there holding assault rifles and shout hate in a counter protest. By doing so, it is not therefore creating a place that feels safe to all people, especially with those with different background, ideologies, and life experiences.The movie goes to show that different viewpoints are not intended to cause or create violence but fighting battles that weren't battles to begin with, may. As long as you follow the crowd and don't challenge the beliefs of the majority you are welcome in that town, but try to make a place safe for everyone and now you become the problem. This does not have to be the case.Let's all watch this film, consider it a mirror and lovingly learn from it as this brave 17 year old shows us how to create better safe spaces. I want to thank everyone who was in the film and apart of making it for doing so with candid courage, kindness, and transparency. Please watch and respond only after deep introspection. After watching I feel a sense of hope and I hope you do too. There is grace!",False
6,9,Examining Race Through Small Towns,tjrubart,n/a,15/08/2025,"After watching this film, it made me wonder how many small towns like this are facing and learning to deal with similar struggles - big questions around race, identity, and what the future looks like.One reviewer mentioned how divided we are - I'd say it seems less like division, and more like two groups of people living in totally separate realities. One group doesn't see anything wrong with declaring ""all lives matter"". Of course, all lives do matter. But for generations, black lives have mattered less, and it's clear America has never fully reckoned with its past.This documentary does a wonderful job of examining what it's like living in a town where being ""nice"" is heralded as one of the highest goods, a town where certain members would rather not fully examine their role in creating an environment where folks from marginalized communities feel less than. It's also about people who are taking imperfect steps (for truly, these are the only steps we can take) towards healing and towards understanding.",False
7,10,"Timely, beautifully crafted, disturbing",hickorybone,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a timely and admirably well-balanced portrait of the monumental clash of culture that is playing out in small towns across the US. The beautiful setting tempers a bit the searing tension of a white, deeply conservative Christian town unsettled by the tectonic shift in race relations and presidential politics in our country. The complexities of the current political climate are exposed and developed by the patient, skillful balancing act that gives voice and faces to both ""sides"" of those involved in this consequential and historic clash. The story of Ansa, her birth father, and her adoptive family provide more than enough inspiration and grace to support a one-dimensional tale of the evils of racism and intolerance alive in this country today, but the filmmakers dug deeper---way deeper---by giving equal exposure to the lives and attitudes of those disturbed and threatened by the emerging activism in their ""perfect"" town. The tension and challenges facing the leaders of Lynden's (as far as I can tell from the film, exclusively Christian) churches, and their responses add another important dimension to this film.The ebb and flow of hope and despair add to the authenticity of this documentary, as does the ending which leaves us with, ""So okay, what next?""This documentary has the chops to inspire and challenge on the national and international stages and here's hoping for its continued success.",False
8,8,Polarization in a Small Town,nicmele,n/a,15/08/2025,"With the permission and assistance of of people on both sides of the political spectrum, ""Lynden"" explores the character and life of a young woman adopted from Ethiopia as she struggles to educate her community about the racism she has experienced. Friends, parents, teachers and some church leaders ally with her. At the same time, it explores the values and concerns of those who oppose her public efforts. The film is unsettling in the questions it raises and beautiful in its cinematography and willingness to let people on the right explain themselves to the camera. There were some disturbing elements in the film, not the least the silence, even absence, of many pastors whose congregations speak for themselves.This film speaks directly to the polarization and violence that seems prevalent in U. S. society. It should be seen by as many people as possible. I am sure many other rural towns and larger cities as well are riven by the disagreements this film explores in Lynden the town.",False
9,10,Balanced and thought provoking,drchaoyingwu,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an important work for this time in our nation. The people represent themselves well, and are all given fair opportunity for self portrayal, resulting in a balanced presentation of a common troubling and dangerous cultural rift in our nation, and some early hopeful efforts to heal.Not an easy film to watch but an important one.May be triggering for those who feel they have been targets of white supremacist hate speech. May be triggering for those who feel they have been unfairly accused of racism.No easy answers here, but an invitation to engage in necessary work. Would be a wonderful watch for mainstream Christian congregations followed by time for reflection in community.",False
10,10,A Perfect Encapsulation of the Cultural Stalemate,s-nikharper,n/a,15/08/2025,"This story is one that's happening everywhere. Whether you're conservative or liberal, it feels like the other side of a debate shuts down and stops listening the moment something they don't like pops up. That is put starkly in the spotlight when the younger generation of this small town try to talk about and stand up for themselves and their experiences. This documentary does a good job of showing the different perspectives that exist in the town of Lynden. If you want to see how some wonderful young people became the thread of change for a small town in America, this is the documentary for you.",False
11,7,Small Town in a changing world,Cycledoc,n/a,15/08/2025,"Interesting documentary. Saw it last month in Lynden. It shows the response to a march for black lives in 2020 in this small Dutch community. It was well done and highlighted the opposition that lined the route of the peaceful march which was organized by an African-American high school student, a trans racial adoptee living in Lynden. Given the loudly proclaimed christian values of this small community, it was sad to see the failure of the religious community to provide appropriate leadership. School kids were met along the way by flag waving, gun toting, bible quoting folks who somehow felt that the march was a threat to them and their lives (my interpretation of their motivation). Churches along the march route had guys with guns on their front steps some placed there by ministers ""protecting"" against sidewalk marchers armed with baby carriages and signs.Highly recommend.",False
12,n/a,Captures small-town complexities and current political divisions,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had the opportunity to see Lynden yesterday (May 2025) at my local indie cinema and would love to see this film garner national distribution. Its story is relevant and timely to all Americans, though the events depicted took place 5 years ago.The film explores the experience of then 17-year-old Amsa Burke, an Ethiopian adoptee who grows up in Lynden, Washington, a small conservative Christian town earnestly proud of its conservative Dutch roots. In the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd in 2020, Amsa organizes a March for Black Lives along Lynden sidewalks. The march is a catalyzing event that shakes the town to its core, revealing uncomfortable truths beneath the veneer of ""nice.""Through many interviews with church leaders, local residents, Amsa's parents, Amsa's friends, and Amsa herself, along with additional footage from a conservative Lynden videographer, the filmmakers are able to present the layered complexity of a small town - because Lynden could be Everytown, USA.Anyone from a small white community will recognize the residents' deep care for history and traditions, resistance to change, big-hearted love for community members, discomfort with outsiders, and uncomfortable racial attitudes.The film is deeply troubling but also hopeful. It's beautifully paced and depicts the natural beauty of the area (full disclosure: I grew up in a small community in the same county and have spent time in Lynden). I particularly appreciated that the filmmakers are local, one having grown up in Lynden himself, so they were able to gain the trust of the town and portray it in a sensitive way. They also bring professional chops to the screen - it's not a homemade film job.I highly recommend seeing Lynden if you can find a way. I hope it gets picked up for national distribution. Everyone deserves the opportunity to see it.",False

1,10,Moved me to tears,lesley-biddle,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an excellent, eye opening documentary about how smartphones and social media are changing the world we live in and how they are affecting the minds of children as well as adults. I am a typical millenial that relies on technology too much. I couldn't wait to finally buy my first iPhone in 2012 ""because everyone else had one"" and I haven't looked back. I've had social media, even before it was considered as such, which included Xanga, MySpace and the earliest days of Facebook. Over the last few years, I've been absolutely burnt out, depressed, and consumed by social media and screen time. I have felt so disconnected from the ""real world"" and I feel my relationships and quality of life have suffered. When Apple made the ""screen time counter"", I was absolutely disgusted by what I saw. I would spend 6 to 7 hours on my phone a day! All I could think of was what valuable experiences/education/happy moments could I have had in that time instead of looking at this stupid screen. This documentary really hit home for me and really opened my eyes and touched my heart. Being a 90s kid, I remember what life was like before technology took over. I long for those more easygoing days. After watching this, I finally took the plunge and bought myself a ""dumb"" phone. I'm going to challenge myself to take a step back in time and to lead a simpler life with real connections. I have nothing bad to say about this film.",False

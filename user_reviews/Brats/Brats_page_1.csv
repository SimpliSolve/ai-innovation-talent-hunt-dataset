1,6,The results of 2 words,pzlgirl,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe best parts -
1. The old videos and clips that brought back a lot of memories from that time period.2. Learning about the negative impact that the article had on their careers back then, I had not realized it effected them as much as it did.3. Seeing a lot of the actors now... they are all still fantastic.The worst parts -
1. It should have been an hour... there were way too many ""clever"" documantary shots. For instance, the video of a video of a video or the reflections in a subway. Cliches that made the story drag out and didn't add to piece.2. Realizing that Andrew either hasn't went to a good counselor in the 35 years since then or he hasn't been open and receptive to what they were saying. You can tell that pretty much every actor he interviewed had processed it and moved on. Most of them seemed to have turned the negative into a positive and let it fuel them on to become better.I am hoping his angst was mostly overemphasized for the project. Anxiety/rumination is a tough combo to live with and I hope he got peace from doing the documentary.I'm glad he did this project and am grateful to him for sharing with us.",True
2,6,It went long ... no mention of Anthony Michael Hall?,wbagot1,n/a,15/08/2025,"The idea was interesting. But the documentary sometimes took itself too seriously, and sometimes was too flippant. It could be overly harsh and other times too forgiving. It would have been good to hear how lives were specifically changed, but instead talked around what happened so no one would be labeled as bitter or brooding.One poignant point was how movies had changed in the early/mid 80s to be youth oriented with movies about teenagers and played by younger actors. It created a swelling of new, young stars never seen to that degree before or since.The focus was on a hit piece article by an envious reporter that labeled them ""the brat pack."" It was supposed to be article on what it was like hanging out with Emilio Estavez for a few days before it was morphed into a scathing denunciation of an entire group. The article was pretty sloppy in its writing and tried to tar and feather as many people as possible, including Nicholas Cage and Tom Cruise.It changed the lives of all the actors. They stopped talking to each or seeing each other to distance themselves from the insinuation. But the damage was done. The label went ""viral"" before that was a term and for a group that was already getting older and would be looking for more adult roles, many found a wall they didn't expect and didn't know how to overcome.Many of the actors most deeply immersed in the time weren't interviewed. Some in the documentary were barely on the outskirts. And again what was truly missing was the nitty gritty of how it impacted rather than hearing again and again versions of wow, that was really something and quite an experience. How did it feel to break contact? What was it like going to movie auditions after that? Had the public reaction change? How did it change their lives?That was the part that was missing.",False
3,7,Impact of Journalism,godmotherprod,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sadly, watching this, I felt bad for the young actors. It did not impact movie goers like it did the actors. I felt the documentary was about the fact that McCarthy let it hit him so hard that it affected his career. Watching the other actors talk about their experience wasn't the same. They were upset, but they moved on, in some ways by separating themselves from the group, which is sad.As a journalism major I was taught to be truthful, but be thoughtful and kind in my approach. Don't leave a trail of bones to make a personal attack, unless you have the experience or talent of the person you're interviewing. You're job is to report the facts, not personal opinion, unless its an editorial, which should hold no weight. The man who wrote the article did not have the same training apparently, nor did the editor. Before you demolish people, talk to them all and walk a mile in their shoes.I'm sorry to see how it affected them personally. I would have enjoyed seeing them together in more movies. As a child of the 80s we related to the characters. I wish Andrew peace and happiness and hope he finds his bliss.",False
4,7,Take me back please.,GlassCityPlayboy,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary hit me like a ton of bricks. The soundtrack, the movie scenes , seeing the guys. I was never able to describe why loved these movies so much but listening to the folks in the film explain why these films were so important to them 100% made me feel like they were speaking for me. To those that gave this film a negative review, it's obvious that you weren't around during those years. This documentary made me want to watch all those movies all over again for the first time. I feel sorry for this generation, you guys can't even spell nostalgia without expecting help from Google translate. Great film.",False
5,6,A slightly awkward look back in time,Littlemicki,n/a,15/08/2025,"Like most Gen X, I grew up with the brat pack so this was an interesting look back at the actors and how the name originated.A lot of the interviews become quite awkward as we see Andrew spend the entire documentary basically lamenting the brat label as though it ruined their lives. Emilio Estevez looks nothing short of uncomfortable as he stands there barely getting a word in other than politely nodding and agreeing.Malcolm Gladwell's section was quite interesting as he offered some great insight into why the Breakfast Club was as popular as it was, pointing out how there was no social media at the time and the movie was one of the first to show 80s kids something they felt genuinely represented them, and how the idea of being brats was cool to them. The producer Lauren Shulee Donner adds to this idea, finally getting Andrew to see that Brat Pack was something seen as cool to teenagers, while Andrew seems to have spent his life being negatively defined by this term.",False
6,7,"Let the healing begin, Andrew.",jaymakak,n/a,15/08/2025,"Andrew McCarthy makes an earnest attempt to put his own struggles with what I always just assumed was a convenient turn of the Sinatra and friend's super cool ""Rat Pack"" nickname, into an 80s-ready contrivance for a hack reporter to weild as a cudgel against a coterie of successful actors who were younger and more talented than he was, to rest.And in the end McCarthy does seem to make peace with the 'Brat Pack' moniker and its implications.Along the way we find out that a few of those talented young actors allowed it to define their very careers and one or two of them are convinced it changed the entire trajectory of their professional lives.A far more important consideration should be writer/director, John Hughes, and the impact on the Brat Pack's careers and the films that he made that many would agree, defined a generation.Someone may have already delved into the Hughes' genius and the legacy he left for us to enjoy.",False
7,7,Interesting perspective but a little uncomfortable,gfink02,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI grew up watching these films, so the documentary was, in part, a fantastic flashback to my formative years. I, and I imagine most fans, had no idea where the label ""Brat Pack"" came from, but to us, it was a humorous, witty description of the young actors churning out film after great film at the time. I never thought about it as a criticism or a negative force that would have a traumatic impact on at least some of their lives and careers.It's easy to dismiss just how vulnerable a young adult can be, just starting out with a career they hope to spend the better part of their lives doing. Whether or not it was rational doesn't really matter. The article that labeled this group was obviously more disruptive than any of us regular fans could have ever known. At least for a few of them. Where the term ""Brat Pack"" elicits fond memories for us, 30+ years later, they are still traumatized by it.I do feel like McCarthy leads most of the conversations and kind of pushes his subjects into agreement, when they were often clearly not as negatively affected by the label as he was. It would have been more interesting to hear their honest perspectives. Rob Lowe clearly embraced it. Emilio clearly didn't hate it, but seemed to be choosing his words so that he wouldn't offend Andrew. Ally Sheedy and Demi Moore both sympathized with him, but neither seemed to have shared the same experience, and both went on to have successful carreers. I honestly feel like the only other actors who may have truly shared his experience refused to participate in the film.The David Blum interview just seemed awkward. It felt as if McCarthy was repeatedly angling for an apology, or at least some acknowledgement that he had ruined careers with his story, or more specifically, the Brat Pack label he coined. Blum was just doing his job, and I can't blame him for feeling pride in coining a term that 30 years later still defines a generation of films. He wasn't being malicious. To me, it would have been more meaningful to see McCarthy come to terms with this fact, honestly.Overall, it was definitely worth watching, especially if you grew up with the Brat Pack and their films. The nostalgia was real. I appreciate the inside perspectives to which I was oblivious prior to this documentary, but because the negative effects of the label, particularly on Andrew McCarthy, were the central theme of the documentary, that story could have been told without all the traveling and other members of the ""Pack."" They seemed to just be there for confirmation.",True
8,10,It turns out that the actual BRAT is David Blum,pdxseayvr,n/a,15/08/2025,"As someone who grew up with the iconic teen films of the 80s, I was eager to see this documentary. Sure...even though I have a nostalgic fondness for Andrew and the other stars of that time, there was a small part of me that prejudged this with an, ""Oh...waa waa waa...labeled a brat when you were young...how devastating."" But once I started watching, and progressively so, I realized they were experiencing the same damage that anyone who has been lied about/has a false or exaggerated reputation precede them has had to deal with...but on a larger scale. They experienced it in front of a huge audience, and in a field where one's career can be made or broken, and turned on a dime, from just one event or one narrative, however false it may be. While none of this is in the realm or war or famine or illness, it's understandable that some of these actors felt negatively impacted by, to some extent, having their dreams and goals hit a brick wall, likely due to the musings of a seemingly jealous and older-though-clearly-equally-immature writer defaming them as...immature. More on David below.I found it fitting and interesting for Andrew to explore the label/article's impact, and he did a masterful job. It was nostalgic and engaging from start to finish, due in large part to Andrew's directing talent, and the courage he and the others had in being open and vulnerable. BTW, Demi's insightfulness was quite a surprising & welcome revelation...someone get her hosting an inspirational podcast, STAT.Now for some words about David Blum:
When Andrew went to visit him, I thought, great...full circle...this will be healing. But very quickly I realized David is, well...a brat. No matter how much he tries to downplay the negativity of the term ""Brat Pack"" - which by itself is not, of course, the end of the world - it shouldn't get lost on anyone that the content of the article was also disparaging. The distorted headline together with the article is what made it damaging. He was trying to capture his moment no less than Emilio, Judd, and Rob were that night...but somehow it was only okay for him to do so. It's not terrible for an actual journalist to write facts that are negative, as too few ""journalists"" even do anymore. But it is cruel for a writer to observe a few young, burgeoning talents enjoying themselves and soaking in the glory as most early-twenty-somethings in that situation would, and then slap them - and their colleagues - with a distorted label that will limit their opportunities in a field that is very sensitive to labels. One could - and should - argue that with fame & fortune comes heaping amounts of criticism, that there are pros & cons to everything, and that it's wise to develop a strong spine to handle it...but very few of us yet have a strong enough spine at that young age...and who among us wouldn't be bothered by a widely publicized exaggeration that will alter the course of our career?The same 29 year old writer who chided their youthful exuberance is the same person who, in this doc, says, ""...partially because, you know, you're 29...that's when you make mistakes...you got to take chances and just swing and do crazy things."" So, it was okay for *him* to ""...swing and do crazy things"", but not okay for them? Not only that, but he defamed them for it. Got it, David.We also get to see that it's apparently okay for *him* to complain about being criticized, as he does when he shares that he thought film critic Richard Schickel ""...was there, it seemed to me, to attack me...and I'm like, really? That seems a little harsh, you know..."" Again, these things are all okay for Blum, but apparently not okay for younger, more successful people (including Tom Cruise - don't miss David's attempted dig on him, too).It should also be noted that his ridiculous point of separating those who went to acting school vs. Those who achieved their fame/success during or fresh out of high school puts his childish, insecure, elitist brattiness on full, glaring display...and that's the poetic justice in all of this: ultimately, the world gets to see that the only actual BRAT all along was - and is - David Blum.",False
9,7,80's kids this one's for you.,rdavisq,n/a,15/08/2025,"From an 80's kids perspective, there were so many young, cool actors that it's easy to lump dozens of people in the mix. Andrew really focuses on ""The Breakfast Club"" ""St Elmo's Fire"" and John Hughes creations in general. He really digs his fingers in the sand to find the root of his personal feelings towards the term and also commonalities from the other members. It's interesting to see the wide spectrum of perspectives from the (finger quotes) brats. Some were fine with it, some didn't even want to be included and McCarthy does well in making both points valid.Documentary films have a specific formula to follow that can make it seem like, sort of, if you've seen one you've seen them all. This one is no different. It really just depends on is the subject matter interesting to you. If you were a kid at the time then yes, these people were rock stars. Ninety minutes feels a bit long, they could have trimmed the fat a bit more. All in all great walk down memory lane. I can almost smell the shopping mall food court, adjacent to the cinema where we dumped quarters into Donkey Kong. Good times.",False
10,4,A missed opportunity.,withnail69,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerI'm a bit baffled by the positive reviews. I think Andrew should have starred in this rather than written and directed it. The endless faux filters were annoying and the editing wasn't great. I'm a huge fan of 80s movies and the brat pack and I was massively looking forward to this. It felt flat to me. It seemed obvious that the article and subsequent fallout affected Andrew a lot more than the others (t certainly didn't seem to harm Rob Lowe or Demi Moores careers). Andrew drives round to various locations to talk to people but never really gets below the surface. I would have liked the actors featured to be asked about what happened next (Its mentioned that they were encouraged not to work together and actively pitted against each other by executives because of the article). Its not a huge spoiler as is mentioned in the trivia section here but Judd and Molly don't appear. I don't know about Judd but I feel like this era affected Molly hugely and she's never been too keen talking about it. She did have a strange relationship with John Hughes and she was his main muse. Rob Lowe (which surprised me) and Ally Sheedy (which didn't) seem to come across the best and most genuine. Demi just repeats a lot of cryptic therapy speak at Andrew and the interview with Emilio is slightly awkward. I wish somebody else had made this but then as Emilio points out... They probably wouldn't have picked up the phone.,True
11,8,Reflections on what life could be,ugagolferdawg,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's interesting to hear what other reviewers have to say about director Andrew McCarthy's vision and compilation of this documentary. Words such as whiny or whack always seem to accompany people's shortsidedness and forget that even though this is not the typical life, it is still someone's life.What was most interesting is to see the different reactions of those who were in the Brat Pack and those who were Brat Pack ""Adjacent."" McCarthy's story comes from a perspective that an article written by a journalist, which we come to find out had gotten his idea from a dinner where he was labeled. Being 29 in the 80's wasn't considered young and he was looking for something to propel him to the next stage of his career. So were McCarthy, Nelson, Ringwald, Sheedy, Lowe, Moore and Estevez. The main difference is that the journalist's life wasn't nearly affected the way he wanted, and had no remorse for how it might have affected the lives of those he wrote about.The issue is that we as humans root for people to be successful until we feel they're too successful, become jealous and ultimately find a way to knock them down a peg. Granted it comes with fame and it just so happened that it hit McCarthy, Nelson and Ringwald the hardest. The others have gone on to much longer and more diverse careers, yet we have a hard time feeling sorry for those people who seemingly had it easy.Ask yourself if there's an event in your life that you still haven't dealt with. If you have adjusted to all trauma, kudos to you! Do you know someone in your family that hasn't? I think this was the crux of what McCarthy was trying to figure out through the exploration of people that meant a great deal to him at one time, yet never really got the answers to why it bothered everyone so. You can see the natural catharsis he goes through as he talks to Sheedy, Lowe, and even a casting director that gave him a different spin on the stigma of the Brat Pack.All in all, the lesson that they all took mostly 30 years to learn is that you're presented with two choices when being pigeon holed in Hollywood. You can allow it to dictate your career for the worse or you can rise above it like several of them did. I believe that McCarthy got the peace he was searching for.Regardless if you like the documentary or not, movies would not be the same without their generational success.",False
12,6,"Wanted to Like it, Comes Up Short",leftbanker-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"First of all, no one read the stupid article and knew whether it was being critical of the kid actors. This was before the internet so an article in New York Magazine wasn't read nationwide. The name stuck as it was easy to remember because it plagiarized the other pack. The article (I just read it for the first time a minute ago) is total crap and if it weren't for the name he coined, no one would have ever spoken of those few thousand words again. It was nothing more or less than a hatchet job by a journalist who probably wanted to sleep with one of them.It's ironic that the one I despised the most in this group as an actor and the one with the most punchable face, Andrew McCarthy, has had an interesting career lately as a travel writer and now this film. I haven't read anything he's written so I'm beginning with his memoir of walking the Camino de Santiago with his son.Nothing much of anything is revealed in this film. Once upon a time there was an article written that coined the name. The supposed members of this Brat Pack, young actors, made a bunch of films dealing with young people. There was never much to this story and thus not much more can be said about it all these years later.The film itself is awkward at times with way too much time inside of a car, too many shots of the film crew lurking around in the background, and there wasn't much at all of what their lives were like 40 years ago.The strangest thing I learned from the film was that none of them were even friends and haven't had any contact with each other in all these years. It just seems like they'd at least call once in a while to comment on a recent project they had finished, either to compliment each other or ask if they knew about it. In the end, they weren't any sort of pack at all.",False
13,5,Unclear,water_bug2,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI didn't know what this was going to be before I watched it, I assumed it would just be a documentary about these actors and the experience of making these movies. I was still intrigued when it became clear that it was actually about the impact of being labeled ""the brat pack""; it never occurred to me that having that label applied would be something that affected their lives or careers. Unfortunately, even after watching the whole thing I still don't really know how it did. They talk about Emilio Estevez turning down a movie he wanted to do to avoid being in another film with Andrew McCarthy, but was the only substantive example of the alleged fall-out. I mean, McCarthy talked about them having PTSD from the impact of it, so I expected some insight into how people didn't take them seriously and casting directors wouldn't consider them, something that would show the struggle they endured, but they never did. Maybe it would have been better to read the book?Also, did everyone forget that Anthony Michael Hall exists? He was in so many Brat Pack movies and no one ever even said his name. Maybe he isn't considered part of the Brat Pack but neither were Jon Cryer or Leah Thompson.",True
14,6,Healing the past person-by-person...,moonspinner55,n/a,15/08/2025,"Engaging documentary from actor Andrew McCarthy on the participants in the popular teen movies of the 1980s--actors who are now pushing 60--and how the label ""Brat Pack"" (taken from the headline in a 1985 New York Magazine article by David Blum, who is interviewed) was possibly a brand, a stigma, a curse, or maybe something special, something that other actors of the time aspired to be a part of. McCarthy, once a pseudo-self-conscious, aloof and somewhat constipated young movie star, took the inspiration for this project from his autobiography, ""Brat: An '80s Story""; his feeling for the past 30 years that the term ""Brat Pack"" was a scathing slap at a certain group of young Hollywood talent circa 1985 isn't unjustified, but his personal wounds--and the sometimes mixed feelings of his contemporaries--are put into perspective here in quickie-therapeutic fashion (aided in its presentation by a bevy of vintage TV clips and interviews). One of the first questions posed is: who was actually in the Brat Pack? I always felt it pertained to select members of the cast of 1985's ""St. Elmo's Fire"" (not everyone, of course; there's no mention of Mare Winningham, for instance). There's also some suspense in McCarthy's rounding up of interviewees, particularly reluctant stars Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson (both of whom decline the invitation). ""Brats"" isn't investigative journalism; McCarthy is out to heal personal and professional wounds, and he wants perspective in his journey from Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Jon Cryer, Ally Sheedy, Lea Thompson, Timothy Hutton, writers, producers and directors. McCarthy insists he is not sentimental and he is not nostalgic--but ""we"" are, and the general catharsis is almost real. **1/2 from ****",False
15,6,The Brat Zone,spayment800,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerActor/Writer/Director Andrew McCarthy, sets out to make a documentary about how being labeled as a member of the ""Brat Pack"" affected the course of his career and his life, as well as those of his fellow Brat Pack compatriots.McCarthy sets out to interview other ""core group"" Brat Packers: Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, and Molly Ringwald. When Nelson proves elusive and Ringwald flatly refuses participation, he widens the net to include several ""Brat Pack Adjacent"" actors: Lea Thompson, Timothy Hutton, Jon Cryer, and a host of other agents, directors, producers, and societal experts to offer their memories and analysis of how the ""Brat Pack"" label affected both the individuals and the film industry at large.While the film contains many memorable clips and outtakes from the most notable examples of the '80's Brat Pack phenomenon (St. Elmo's Fire, The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, etc.), it spends far more time focusing on McCarthy and others' lingering PTSD from being summarily ""labeled"" in the relative infancy of their careers.Ultimately, it becomes a prolonged session of therapeutic introspection, with each of the supposed ""Brats in Recovery"" spouting buzz words and coping phrases likely derived from their own personal therapy sessions. Meanwhile, other outsider opinions vary, with several, perhaps correctly pointing out, that the supposedly ""negative"" label only enhanced and promoted their fame.The ultimate interview with the ""villainous"" journalist who coined the ""Brat Pack"" label is worth waiting for, even if it does not entirely resolve all of McCarthy's lingering insecurities. A memorable '80's soundtrack and a nice homage to the late John Hughes are also worthwhile.Lastly, one huge annoyance is McCarthy's decision to edit the film such that the framing and resolution is constantly shifting between various formats-full screen, wide screen, letter-box, iPhone, standard, hi-res, lo-res, side bars-it's visually jarring and even caused me to initially wonder whether something was wrong with our television.""Do not attempt to adjust your television. We are controlling the transmission. You are entering the ""Brat Zone.""",True
16,6,Get over it!,ScottoMac,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was fun reminiscing about these movies and their actors. The 1980s were my teen years, so these movies really resonated with me. These movies broke new ground by focussing on teens/20 somethings and their relationships and insecurities.It is weird to think that the article which came up with the term ""brat pack"" was so traumatising to Andrew McCarthy. I read this article before watching the movie, as I hadn't read it previously (but was familiar with the term 'brat pack'). The article was about a night out with Emilio Estevez, and to some degree Rob Lowe and others. It mentioned McCarthy only once and in passing. It gave insight to a night out with some young stars and the attention lavished on them. Surprise, surprise: they were bratty, entitled & loving it.McCarthy gave it so much credence, that didn't exist. It was more about his own insecurities reflecting back on him. Most of the others used it as a badge of honour, or a chance to try and prove the author of the article wrong. McCarthy seems like he would have melted down with or without the article. It was fascinating to see a 60 year old man realise the article was neither here nor there. It was also nice to see people he worked with 35+ years ago humour him and help him overcome his demons.Not a great documentary, but a bit of fun reminiscing about these movies, their actors, and my own memories of these times.",False
17,6,History Repeats Itself,shanevannatter,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAndrew McCarthy's attempt to bring his personal resentment and narrative to film. Embarking on a journey to reacquaint himself with a select group of colleagues he estranged himself from 40 years ago in hopes to justify his position in life today.Andrew McCarthy attempts to interview the elusive actors and actresses that were, in his opinion, erroneously labeled as ""Hollywood's Brat Pack."" His focus is the cast of St. Elmo's Fire, The Breakfast Club, and Pretty in Pink, along with the behind the camera people on those sets, and the person who coined the media frenzied ""Brat Pack.""It begins with Andrew McCarthy explaining the negative affects he has experienced throughout his life as a result of an article titled 'Hollywood's Brat Pack' authored by David Blum and published in New York Magazine, circa June 1985. He is successful in meeting with Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Lauren Shuler Donner, Marci Liroff, Loree Rodkin, and David Blum. As the narrative plays out, Andrew McCarthy realizes not everyone shared his sentiment. The ones who were supportive and sympathetic to his opinions are the ones, like himself, who never saw success after the 1980's and those that shared similar sympathies and different opinions garnered far more success throughout their lives. In a final attempt, he tries to get David Blum to admit fault for the fallout and get an apology. He soon learns that is not going to happen.In the end, the culmination of newly found information sheds light on how the word 'Brat' was far more true than the pun ever meant, Emilio Estevez has had to bear the burden of all the success and failures with every person associated for 40 years, and how Andrew McCarthy harbors a completely new feeling of self resentment for denying himself and his colleagues an unimaginable amount of success.Just as the 1980's ended the career of a promising young star, that same person ended this documentary just before a true realization was bestowed upon on him.",True
18,10,Nostalgia from a perspective the audience was blind to,skider,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary sheds light on the personal experience for a group of actors who many of us loved to watch but whose actual lives were unknown to us. Easy to understand how at such a young age the label of being in the ""brat pack"" could have lasting impact. It's not often you reach such a level of fame and success, and then in a single day are given a brand you never wanted. Andrew conveys his experience and meets with others in the brat pack and discusses their experiences and insights. FYI - Demi is an of insightful sage.As a fan of the brat pack, it was simply great to see them all again. The documentary was enlightening as I never even considered being part of the brat pack could be a negative thing. To me the brat pack was a group of actors who portrayed our experiences as teenagers on screen and we wanted to see them in every movie. Seeing them in ensembles was great, as were solo features, we never took it negatively but rather as a way to connect with them and always wish for their success.Overall, this is one I recommend as a case study in the power of the written word. Once article changed all their lives, and this picture shows you how. Worth watching and well made. The nostalgia factor is also mind blowing and made this so much more enjoyable. Think of this as the brat pack finally dealing with their demons from the past, while we get to learn about them, their connections to one another, and how they felt about this brand. It also made me realize how much I missed them all; never will there be a time like the 80s again and never will there be such a talented group of young actors like the brat pack ever again.",False

I enjoyed these movies and occasionally watch the movies.I not sure about McCarthy - he puzzles me. He strikes as a lost soul, looking for answers as to why his career did not turn out as he had hoped. The movie was interesting , in some ways more questions than answers.Why did Judd and Molly decline to appear? The interview with Emilio seemed quite uncomfortable. You got a sense that this hook up after all the years would not lead to them becoming close again.Revisiting the past no matter who you are and what you do does not bring answers or closure.I got a sense the actors didn't like the BRAT PACK name, but most of them moved on and got over it.",False
20,3,I regret watching this,csherman-94270,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm absolutely Gen X and I grew up with the movies and actors here. The longer I stayed with this doc, the more dismayed I was with what Andrew McCarthy was trying to do.I don't know exactly what I expected but it certainly wasn't listening to the director complain ad nauseum about a single article written some thirty plus years ago that he still can't get over.I felt like he was in therapy and talking to his psychiatrist rather than making a movie about a film genre that was and is still important to me.The longer this movie went on, the worse I felt about it. I'm glad I watched to the end to hear actual words of some wisdom from Rob Lowe but I still wish I hadn't watched it.It feels like sour grapes all the way through and if you're nostalgic about old movies you loved in the eighties, you should stay away from this depressing piece of self indulgent whining.",False
21,9,Nice time capsule of the glory years,tronvszombies-1,n/a,15/08/2025,Andrew McCarthy corals interviews from a stellar group of eighties superstars who rode the wave of mega hit movies. It is light and fluffy with McCarthy a perfect host delving into the thoughts of the happening. I was a teen of the eighties so this documentary is preaching to the choir. It's great seeing the whole gang again.It's nice to get some insight to the feelings they were having during the highs of there career. With analysis from the people behind the scenes and journalists who propelled the 'Brat Pack' into the consciousness. Plenty of cool clips obviously.

22,6,"First world problems, but interesting look at the human psyche",blaircatlinbrown,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerConsidering the wide-angle view of the world, the Brat Pack's plight is certainly a First World Problem, but that doesn't mean that this documentary isn't interesting. Unfortunately, I had to take a star away because Ringwold and Nelson didn't join the conversation. That may not be fair to McCarthy, but a documentary often lives and dies on the caliber of the people featured. The picture just felt incomplete without them.What I found fascinating is how the same event was perceived so differently by everyone involved. Honestly, the career issues caused by the name are pretty standard for younger actors who find early success. They're often identified with one role or one type of role and struggle to be considered beyond that lane. It sounds like the bigger issue was the article, itself.I haven't read it, but it sounds like the author leaned into the clever title and became a bit mean. After the author was interviewed it became quite clear to me that the author struggles with envy and/or social norms. He struggled with talking fluently with McCarthy (often talking over him) and struggled to be able to read the room or make appropriate analogies. I have a sneaking suspicion that the whole thing made him feel powerful over a group of attractive, popular people who, in society, are not a group that typically treats him well. The bullied kid became the bully.Again, it's a shame because the name is iconic.Rat Pack to Fat Pack to Brat Pack...what an interesting ride.",True
23,4,Know Thyself To Be a Brat,EUyeshima,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm of the same generation as the members of the Brat Pack, but I have to admit my takeaway from Andrew McCarthy's 2024 documentary was mostly indifference. The film amounts to the actor's personal odyssey in examining the impact of the media's Brat Pack designation back in 1985 on him and his close-knit colleagues, almost all of them in their early 20's. Nearly four decades later, McCarthy, now 61, uses a first-person narrative to track down his fellow Brat Packers as well as Brat Pack-adjacent actors like Lea Thompson and Timothy Hutton and even David Blum, the magazine journalist who wrote the puff piece that introduced the term. Despite his genuine efforts toward personal revelation, McCarthy often comes across as self-entitled and obsessed with the ""brat"" moniker all these years later. His fellow sixtyish Brat Packers appear downright sanguine compared to him (Ally Sheedy, a poker-faced Emilio Estevez, a chill Rob Lowe, and a post-therapy Demi Moore), and Blum is understandably unapologetic about his role in hurting the feelings of a group of celebrities who are clearly not hurting financially.",False
24,6,A fun albeit cringey walk down memory lane!,Minniehaha74,n/a,15/08/2025,"Everyone of these people that are on the screen hold a significant place in my brain and in the way I act and what I see as succes, how I still see the separation of classes. I get why they were so stressed about the ""Brett pack"" term, but for the rest of us poor shlubs that would never be beautiful or charming or rich, that was where we wanted to be! We would've sold our right arm and our mothers to be part of the brat pack, to live that lifestyle of beauty. One of the things that I've noticed is that they complain that maybe their careers didn't go the way they had hoped because of this term and yet every single one of them live beautiful homes and have families which is where I get to the cringe part I understand that it frustrated them, but to have PTSD over Rich and famous careers is a little much for me .",False
25,7,First and foremost 'Brats' shows that young actors in Hollywood are vulnerable,andredejongh,n/a,15/08/2025,"First and foremost 'Brats' shows that young actors in Hollywood are vulnerable. Andrew McCarthy tells us that the term 'Brat Pack' had a big impact on some of the young artists' minds, who were part of this pack. Understandbly as a young person you want to be taken seriously and when a journalist from a renowned newspaper all of a sudden calls you a brat, this can be hurtful and even traumatic for young sensitive artists. The art of an actor is to be sensitive so they can transcribe thoughts, feelings and emotions via their whole being, onto the screen or onto a stage. I very much also understand the journalist being proud of himself with this genius terminology 'Brat Pack'. Where it went wrong was with the guidance from agents and production companies who should have helped these young professionals. It is probably one of the sides of Hollywood that is being ignored: the lack of guidance, the lack of help to understand and define everything that is happening around them and to help them explain and help them to deal with all the turmoil that comes with becoming famous and successful in Hollywood. It sounds to me that the young actors were left tending to themselves on how to deal with all of this. So it is not where the journalist went wrong, but where the whole Hollywood industry failed them. Hollywood as an industry failed them, it failed to be there for their money making actors. Especially when teenagers and young adults are involved. But also when people are adults and experience a sudden succes and fame in Hollywood, there should be good professional help and guidance for a long period of time. I think it would prevent many addictions, many depressions and many stressful, negative feelings. I think this is a subject that should have been talked about, in this documentary. But it shows that even now, as middle aged people, these actors still need to figure out for themselves how to deal with these kinds of phenomenons. So, of course they should have been proud being called the Brat Pack. All of a sudden they were put on the same pedestal as the original Rat Pack. The journalist could have called them Rat Pack 2.0.. But let's face it: Brat Pack is a much better, literary title. It is a badge of honour. And of course they were seen as Brats, when all of a sudden these young actors are making money as never seen before in Hollywood, looking at young actors. And the older generation probably would have also called them Brats, out of jealousy and spite. But when you're in your early 20's without lots of life experience, this could prove to be too difficult to put into context. But everyone around the world wanted to be a Brat like them, have succes like them, be charismatic and communicatively able like them and yes to party like them and be respected like them. Because let's face it: being given such a huge badge of honour, being called the Brat Pack in direct reference to the influential Rat Pack, is a testimony to the succes and influence of these young people right there and then in the 1980's. It is a sign of huge respect, there just weren't professionals around these young people to explain this to them.",False

1,10,Sheer beauty,balintkinga,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just saw this wonderful picture last night on the big screen. I felt mostly gratitude because the creators showed me all these spectacular places and colorful life in just two hours of visual poetry, humorous and cozy storytelling and hauntingly beautiful music, the result of 10 years of work on their behalf, a project of love and respect towards the One and Only Mother Nature with all her forms of life, big and small.I grew up in the countryside of Transylvania, in a small village surrounded by endless pine forests, the kind that inspired Bram Stoker I think, so I was very close to nature. I loved it, those places had nothing to do with tourism and it was quiet, it was wild as it should be, and now, thanks to Romania Salbatica I got to visit those places again and much more, it was lovely to see Nature again like that, just minding her own business, undisturbed.",False

3,9,"Wild Romania, a spectacle of nature",Didi_braun,n/a,16/08/2025,"Breathtaking, captivating, surprising and excellent executed. A documentary we needed and we need to see of the inaccesible, raw and impressive world surrounding us. As Romanians, Europeans, for all generations, for our kids, for images never seen or captured before in these territories. The whole spectacle is beautifully harmonized and put together, passionately and amusingly described by a surprising voice of the country's journalist or by the captivating English narrator. Professionally done, of a quality no less than Attenborough's productions. As a 3 episode miniseries on Max, even better as a 2h film that you still do not want to end, the story is told as the cycle of life or the nature's seasons.Comprises imagery and education of the natural territory of all forms, from flora, fauna to relief forms, a geography lesson, the wilderness and hard-to-reach habitats, the breathtaking scenery, protected areas and natural reserves, national parks, the particularities and uniqueness of the country, so rich and big in beauty and gifts.The result of 10years work impresses even an inhabitant of these places, who would not have the chance to encounter these rare creatures in their lifetime or reach such sites. It is amazing to realize that they even cohabit with us, but we rarely notice. There is always more than meets the eye.",False

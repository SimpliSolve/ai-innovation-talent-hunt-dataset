1,8,Nature show I can watch with kids!,UrbanElysium,n/a,17/08/2025,"Most animal/nature shows show such graphic violence of animals fighting/ bloodshed/ gore- I hate those.!! I do NOT want to watch that- I know what happens in wild!THIS series only hints at that and just focuses on sounds of nature in many different aspects. From the animals mating calls to elemental sounds. This I love!Well produced, very informative, amazing visuals and Tom Hiddleston's narration ( the most soothing voice!) is excellent!I knew half of the information, other half I got educated. This is a great series for families, especially with younger kids because it doesn't show animals killing other animals.",False
2,8,Lovely filmography & good narration with interesting facts; must see,cgtam,n/a,17/08/2025,"This Apple series is well done, showing how wonderful natures' sounds are WITHOUT PPL noise that bombards entire planet 24/7.Best, the Apple film/ sound crew did not harm nor kill any of wildlife shown in this series, unlike Disney's ""Ghost in the mountains"" & ""Born in China"" films where Disney crew repeatedly darted & collard the supermom snow leapard renowned by natives, & then cruelly watched her die slow death of starvation along with her 2 FEMALE TEEN CUBS. If Disney didn't choose her for their film, she def would've survived & raised her 2 cubs to maturity- so skip THAT film.Here, Apple crew film with many hidden camera traps & wait over 2 yrs to capture snow leopard mating call & courtship.Many enchanting new clips are captured. Tom Hiddleston does very good narration with better written interesting script, showing glimpse how fragile & vulnerable top predators are in reality.What script omits are vast amounts of resources PPL take DAILY ie, known fact in few managed seas - whales, orcas, dolphins, seals etc as total group only take 1% of ALL fish, esp herring, while PPL TAKE OVER 95% of ALL & every fish type DAILY. This should be in script. Also, Japan kills all dolphins while its huge ships fish in other countries oceans & international waters bc Japan deems dolphins as ""competition eating too much fish."" Watch the horrific chilling true docu ""the Cove"" if u don't believe this. Fact not in script: Other 4% = billions of bycatch that's killed & dumped back into the sea as trash, from endangered turtles to sharks to orcas- all ""trash bycatch"" due to NO regulations of fishing in last few places fish are somewhat plentiful. NATO govts refuse to regulate the seas.Here, there's no gore so rated G. Hearing nature with new tech microphones & recordings is a delight. Many shots are old bc planet no longer looks pristine, & last ep gives behind scenes tidbits of consequences of global warming. See Plastic Ocean filmed over 10 yrs ago, or Netflix's Chasing Coral 2009.This Apple series is similar to Sir David's 35 yr old wondrous ""Birds of Paradise."" Since 2005, many Scientists have been studying global ""sound pollution by PPL"" & real adverse affects esp to endangered whales, turtles, dolphins & orcas; script should include some of those facts.When Sir David finally retires, it should be Jeremy Irons or Tom Hiddleston as voice of BBC.",False
3,9,Amazing continent-spanning nature documentary,dfloro,n/a,17/08/2025,"Anchored by the exceptional narration of Loki's Tom Hiddleston, new audio technologies and techniques are utilized by a dedicated team of wildlife biologists & other scientific researchers to document a variety of fascinating means of intraspecies (and interspecies) communication. Much (but by no means all) of this is driven by the mating season and its striking, bizarre acts to attract the opposite gender and reproduce. You'll learn and observe how crocs hear and feel the sounds of their offspring, how male spiders pluck musical vibrations on females' webbing, how male koala bears use their 2 sets of vocal chords to create bass bellows indicative of an animal 20 times their size, and the songs sung by snow leopards in order to call to one another in the treacherous mountains of the Himalayas. Each of the dozen episodes of this miniseries ends with a few minutes ""Behind the Sounds,"" highlighting the lengths the crew go to in order to capture such never-before-heard audio (for example, the equivalent of 4 Everest climbs in 4 years so as to record the elusive snow leopard). Absolutely incredible show, and you do owe it to your entire family to experience the whole thing!",False
4,10,"Enthralling, stunning, magical documentary series",PhilmGuru,n/a,17/08/2025,"This has to be one of the greatest nature series I have ever seen. The production values are absolutely astounding - stunning, vibrant, sumptuous rich 4K HDR with incredibly well mastered Atmos audio. When we put this on our 87"" OLED it feels like we are transported into the environment. The picture in places almost looks and feels 3D. What are good production values though with the content to back it up? It absolutely shines here as well - I guarantee you will see magical elements of nature you never knew about and find out new things about animals that sound like something out of a sci-fi story. You will not be bored and Hiddleston is a fantastic choice for the narration.I have no idea why Apple aren't marketing this more. It's absolutely blown me away on every level and I desperately hope they make another season.The only negative I will highlight is that the bitrate in some high motion scenes is just too low and the illusion is occasionally broken. This is hopefully easily fixable with a better encode, but it's really screaming out for an UltraHD Blu-ray, but sadly I don't see any chance of that ever happening.At the end of each episode there is also a short making of, showing the crew recording on location. This is a lovely little treat at the end of each episode and I'm so glad they included it!",False
5,8,EARTHSOUNDS,T-Flix,n/a,17/08/2025,"Rating - 8.3This nature docuseries was amazing to watch! The way they captured mother nature and let us see just how beautiful and unique she really is was nice to see. Each episode was enjoyable as they cover animal sounds from every unique climate the world has to offer. This series will definitely give you an understanding of just how impressive our animal kingdom is and just how complex and powerful their sounds are. I would for sure recommend this for anyone that enjoys the great outdoors and if you have a nice sound system I suggest using it to add to the experience!I'm T-Flix and I hope your day is full of peace, love, unity and respect! Love y'all!",False

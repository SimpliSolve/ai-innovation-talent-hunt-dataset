1,9,Hilarious!,thatruthmusic,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't care for some of the raunchy content, but I'm glad I stuck it out through those parts, because he has actually become one of the best comedians I've ever seen! A lot of his material made me laugh out loud (literally) and all of this is coming from someone who can't make it through most comedian's specials! I usually shut them off after they fail to make me laugh for the first 10-15 minutes, or they disgust me with low brow content so much in the 1st 5 minutes that I get too turned off to continue. While Morril may have some bits I didn't care for, overall I've found him to be extremely creative, talented, and hilarious! Even when he's borderline offending his audience, he has a witty and endearing knack for self deprecation that ends up being really funny at times as well! If it weren't for some of the raunchy parts, I'd give this a 10. I recommend all of Sam Morril's specials (including Up On the Roof) to those looking for laughs, and I really can't say that about any other comedian other than maybe Jerry Seinfeld. I plan to watch all his specials again in the near future, and I'm already looking forward to the next new one.",False
2,4,This is what offensive content means,OneAnjel,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm a big fan of stand up but so many comedians are disappointing. I'm not a prude and can stand some very offensive ""humor"" when other better material surrounds it. Morril is one of these, for the most part. The warning at the front says Course Language, but that's not really true; there's not a bunch of f-bombs or conventional course language. What he has is a lot of very offensive material about abortion and miscarriage, which the audience responds well to - and I'm just thinking wtf is wrong with our culture? There's also lots of the standard relationship fodder and sexual situations. He then spends the last 10-15 min reading text from an old flame who is stalking him, which while amusing and disturbing didn't belong in a stand up routine.Morril actually had decent delivery and a few chuckle-worthy anecdotal one liners - most of which we've all heard or thought at some point. So there's nothing new here. It wasn't a complete waste of time but I wouldn't watch anything from him again.",True

1,3,"Work in progress, not final film quality.",lesdroits,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nice idea, but had major problems. First, it was quite confusing with shots going back and forth among three generations with stand-ins for some older relatives in their youth (I'm assuming) such that it was not always clear who was who. Second, it was so chopped up as to be almost stream of consciousness which kept it from driving to any point or even sustained ambience. And third, it could have told the same super simple story equally well (or better) in one-third the time, i.e., In desperate need of an editor and organization. Showed the same old home movie scenes numerous times, and really started to drag after a bit. Interesting characters, as southern characters tend to be. Needs a rework.",False

Awesome thrilling experience, felt goosebumps so many time.. and lot to learn and rekindle... Journey within and God is within....It started with a story of conflicts, disbelief, and a practical approach and then showed how life is not simple and sometime we just see one side of the object and believe that just our side of it is only true, everyone else is just saying nonsense.And you never know that the people on other side our more expressive or many folds ahead of you but they are looking at a complete object, your view, their view and whole view..

The show provided answers to numerous questions that I had about this ancient religion, its practices, beliefs, and philosophies. The content was not only rich in knowledge but also presented in an entertaining manner, making it easy to understand and absorb. The show's approach to explaining complex concepts in a simple, engaging way is commendable. I was particularly impressed by the depth and breadth of the topics covered. It's not just a show for those who follow Santana Dharma, but also for anyone interested in understanding diverse cultures and religions. I believe it's a must-watch for people from all walks of society, irrespective of their religious beliefs. It's a great way to broaden one's horizons and gain a new perspective on life.

15,10,Rediscovering the spirituality for Gen-Z,ravimsh,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series truly touches the soul of India. Millennials and later generations of Hindus have actually lost their spiritual roots. We have reduced the deep concepts of Hinduism to one line quotes without understanding the underlying meaning. This series actually addresses this. For example my understanding of simple concept of ""Work is worship"" has changed to completely new level.This series deals with real emotions in any typical Indian family. It touches the importance of spirituality in Indian society and ends with a genuine conclusion. The journey to all Shakti Peethas is something that I enjoyed the most. Pleasantly my own city was also shown and to my surprise even I was unaware of many facts about the spiritual aspects of my city. Overall it is a series to treasure forever. Kudos to the whole team for taking up such a neglected subject and present it in its full glory.",False

Both parties Samir and Sanjay have different agendas but one thing was common ... both were finding answers to their inner questions. We all hear these quotes in everyday life like ""karma kar fal ki icha na kar"", neki kar darya mein dal"", ""athithi devo bhav"", but we don't know what is the purpose behind it.

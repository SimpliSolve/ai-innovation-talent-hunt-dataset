1,6,The original narrative greatly eclipses it's modern counterpart,CadenCotard,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm somewhat of a sucker for the modern reproduction values. Having seen a few different endurance documentaries over the years, I do think that the modern enhancements were clever. The use of AI seemed pretty morally sound, although it may be more divisive, I thought it was interesting. Others should find it innocuous at worst.Another viewer mentioned that reproductions should always be noted as such, and I have to admit that especially with all the enhancements of the historical footage, this would have been nice.Shackeltons original tale is captivating, I found myself on the edge of my seat during flashbacks. His words and the descriptions of his crew are poetic at times. The overall story itself is nothing short of miraculous...almost unbelievably so. The amount of grit, determination those men had to have had, and the amount of absolute misery they must have endured is difficult to comprehend.This is why when parallels start being drawn between the two voyages I start to wince a little bit...The modern expedition leader talking about how his own crew is getting tired...shots of drone operators putting their gloved hands in front of industrial sized heaters to drive home that point of their own harsh reality...
That's not to diminish their accomplishment. It just goes to demonstrate how truly awe inspiring Shackeltons original expedition was.In particular the ending speech about how ""Shackelton would have been impressed with what they accomplished..."" etc...is just a little too silly in an egotistical way. Perhaps it was earned, but by the end of the documentary I'd had enough of the modern crew. I think if they would have gone with more of a 75/25 proportion of historical account vs modern voyage it could have been much better...it's hard for me not to want pretty much the whole thing to be about the original journey, only with the additional modern flare/reproduction values. As it stranded the breakdown was more like 50/50.Nonetheless, the final scene of their 'findings' is very well done, and overall the documentary is worth a watch (I did find myself skipping a bit through the modern hunt scenes to get to more Shackelton).",True
2,7,"Worthwhile, but could have been better.",shauncore808,n/a,17/08/2025,"I can't help but think that this would have been better as two separate documentaries; the story/recreation of Shackleton's journey, and the search for the wreck of the Endurance. Combined, both stories feel very much like they've been edited down into chunks instead of the stories flowing naturally. The modern-day search feels especially disjointed, like they weren't sure about what to show and what not to. The constant reference to ""days left"" made the whole thing feel cheap, like a reality show. Like they had to add that to insert unneeded tension instead of just telling a story that's worth telling. (Also pointless since you know they'll find it) It's also absurd (and a little gross) to compare the modern mission with Shackleton's. Yes, the mission is tough, but come on. The two voyages aren't even in the same league.They really should have just split these up. It would have been nice to get some technical info on the research ship and submersible. Then they could have taken their time with the search and showed more of their thought process and how things were done.",False
3,8,Restores my faith in National Geographic documentary,blaynefitz-66115,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI have become a tad cynical and dismissive of documentaries nowadays since everything you could want to learn about history can be found on Youtube in some form. Where as documentary seem to drag out information for dramatic effect and to fill a time slot.However this documentary changed my mind as it showed how good a high budget documentary can be. With convincing dramatic recreations of scenes, tied seamlessly with the amazing real arrival footage and photographs. And The story being told from the voices of the original crew, both authentically recreated and archival.I enjoyed that the story it was interwoven with the 2022 search for the wreck, as it helped connect the then with the now. And the wonderful drone shots of Antartica and of the ship breaking through the ice were pretty neat. The ending with the 3D scan and HD footage of the perfectly preserved wreck was icing on top.The story of Shackleton and his men certainly made for a greater legacy than I think he himself could have imagined, and a story everyone should learn about.",True
4,9,If you EVER think of giving up..read Shackleton's story!,atischoo,n/a,17/08/2025,"A case of reality being harder to believe than fiction! The superhuman feat of endurance against hardships and environmental conditions, Shackleton and his crew achieved for such a long period of time can never be overstated.To think they ALL survived (without our modern gear and equipment) by sheer force of will and spirit, as the only alternative was to lay down and let the cold take them, seems almost impossible by our standards today.Dan Snow's narrative blends tributes to Shackleton's experiences, with this modern high tech expedition to find the Endeavour's lost wreck 100+ years later, and becomes in effect, an Epilogue for their original story.Some scenes need re-editing, as saying how tough it was for the deck crew in cold weather, who then had the luxury of a hot shower, a meal and warm bed as needed, does them no favours, as it invites comparison to Shackleton and his crew! That said..still an historic and successful endeavour..",False
5,8,Thank you National Geographic,Bluesky87999,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerA 'boys own' historic story, that whilst I knew of, never truly fully comprehended the true feat and dare I say 'endurance' of the human spirit. Both, the actual happening of events as they unfolded and the search and the subsequent discovery of the Endurance as she lay undisturbed is itself a testament that even sometimes, we as humans, get things right. Apparently, I still have over two hundred characters to type before I can post. Assume, it's something to do with spoilers. Anyway, I will liken this documentary to Apollo 13, on the face of it, a technical failure and yet somehow, you are sitting at home cheering the home coming. Thanks again to all involved, 10/10.",True
6,6,Where are the captain and ice pilot?,Riverhousenut,n/a,17/08/2025,"This film has much going for it, esp for those who don't know the Shackleton story. Views will differ on the usefulness of colorizing the old photographs, AI-reproducing the voices of the dead, and the recreations; I didn't find these to be improvements, and believe recreations should always be tagged as such (even when they're obvious). But I see no excuse for almost completely ignoring the captain and ice pilot, Knowledge Bengu and Freddie Ligthelm. Mensun Bound's book is clear on their challenges and extraordinary skills. I can think of various reasons why the film ignores them, but all of them leave a bad taste in my mouth.",False
7,8,Journey at the edge of the world,sjspode,n/a,17/08/2025,"I came into this not knowing anything about Shackleton's story apart from the ship being stuck in the ice. The documentary was a great way to tell this heroic story, underlaid by the modern day expedition to find the wreck of Shackleton's ship 'Endurance'.Primarily using original film footage and spoken diary / journal entries plus some TV interviews of Shackleton's crew really brought their stories to life. What they endured definitely put the trials and tribulations of the modern crew into context, and their highs and lows of searching for the wreck paled into insignificance compared to the life and death struggles of 100 years ago.Really interesting but perhaps my main criticism was the lack of detail given to the Endurance once it had been found. A 3D scan of the ship was pictured but without showing how that was created, given the challenge of capturing high quality data at that depth and in total darkness. Would have happily had some details of the Shackleton or modern crew stories reduced to give more time to that.Overall, definitely recommended.",False
8,7,Inspiring...,Thanos_Alfie,n/a,17/08/2025,"""Endurance"" is a Documentary in which we follow the remarkable story of a person who, despite overwhelming odds, showed the world the true meaning of endurance. It is an inspiring tale of overcoming hardship, where perseverance leads to triumph.I found the documentary highly engaging, especially because of its focus on real, raw emotions and the challenges faced by the protagonist. Both the interviews and behind-the-scenes footage added depth to the story and brought a personal touch to the journey. In addition, the seamless balance between storytelling and the educational aspects of the subject made the difference while the visuals were beautifully conveyed the message of strength. Finally, I have to say that ""Endurance"" is definitely worth watching since it's a motivational reminder that with enough grit and determination, we can push through the toughest situations so, I highly recommend it.",False
9,10,Masterpiece,bergy-97063,n/a,17/08/2025,"The 2024 documentary Endurance is a breathtaking and profoundly inspiring portrayal of Sir Ernest Shackleton's legendary Antarctic expedition aboard the Endurance. Directed with precision and reverence, the film delves into one of history's most extraordinary tales of survival, highlighting Shackleton's exceptional leadership, unyielding grit, and unwavering determination in the face of overwhelming odds.At the heart of Endurance lies the story of a man who refused to surrender to despair, even as his ship became trapped in ice and his dreams of crossing Antarctica crumbled. Shackleton's ability to maintain morale and unity among his crew during nearly two years of isolation in one of the harshest environments on Earth is a testament to his remarkable character. Through a blend of archival footage, dramatic reenactments, and heartfelt interviews with historians and Shackleton's descendants, the film captures not just the journey itself but the indomitable spirit that defined Shackleton as a leader.A Portrait of Leadership Under PressureShackleton's leadership is the documentary's cornerstone, and rightfully so. Faced with adversity that would have broken lesser men, Shackleton exhibited an extraordinary capacity for decision-making and empathy. The film meticulously recounts how Shackleton prioritized his crew's survival over personal glory, making the difficult but necessary choices to abandon their expedition's original goal to ensure everyone's safety.One of the documentary's most poignant moments is its depiction of Shackleton's decision to lead a daring 800-mile voyage in a small lifeboat across the treacherous Southern Ocean to seek rescue. This feat, achieved with minimal navigational tools and in the face of relentless storms, underscores his boundless courage and resourcefulness. Shackleton's leadership extended beyond physical endurance; he cultivated a sense of hope among his men, reinforcing their belief that survival was possible even when the odds seemed insurmountable.Grit and Determination in the Face of AdversityThe icy desolation of Antarctica becomes a character in its own right, a seemingly insurmountable antagonist. The film's cinematography vividly captures the stark beauty and unforgiving brutality of the Antarctic landscape. Yet, it is Shackleton's grit that stands in stark contrast to the cold, lifeless expanse. The documentary shows how Shackleton faced hunger, frostbite, and exhaustion with remarkable resilience. His determination to keep his crew alive is a masterclass in perseverance. Shackleton's philosophy, captured in his own words-""By endurance we conquer""-echoes throughout the film as a resounding message of human tenacity.The crew's collective grit is equally inspiring. Through Shackleton's leadership, these men endured the collapse of their ship, the monotony of months spent on drifting ice floes, and the brutal journey to Elephant Island. Yet, they remained steadfast, united by their leader's vision and their shared commitment to survival. This cohesion is a testament to Shackleton's ability to inspire loyalty and trust, even in the direst of circumstances.A Universal Message of HopeWhile Endurance is firmly rooted in the specifics of Shackleton's journey, the documentary resonates on a universal level. It is a story of hope, courage, and the power of human resilience. Shackleton's example serves as a beacon for anyone facing adversity, demonstrating that even in the darkest moments, leadership and determination can light the way forward.The film also serves as a reminder of the enduring relevance of Shackleton's legacy. His ability to lead with compassion and strength, to make decisions based on the greater good, and to inspire others to rise above their limitations offers valuable lessons for today's leaders. Shackleton's story transcends time, speaking to the unbreakable human spirit and the potential within each of us to overcome even the most daunting challenges.ConclusionEndurance is more than a documentary; it is a tribute to the extraordinary power of the human will. Shackleton's journey is a story that inspires and humbles, reminding us of what can be achieved when courage, determination, and leadership converge. As the final credits roll, viewers are left not just with an appreciation of Shackleton's historic expedition, but with a renewed belief in the boundless potential of the human spirit.",False
10,7,Good documentary with high AI technology,Hazu29,n/a,17/08/2025,"I enjoyed this documentary film. I think I never read or watched anything about the Endurance before, although it reminded me of a couple of tv shows and books but with different stories. I didn't mind the AI parts at all, it was a nice touch. When made it well, I have no issue with this type of AI, but I hope it doesn't become a trend because some studios might start abusing it.The modern story of the guys looking for the Endurance wreck starts well but soon starts to get boring, too much time wasting and when we reach the end it's just a couple of minutes with the footage we all wanted to see... Oh well.Regarding the old story of the Endurance, it's magnificent, but a warning for some people more emotional who love animals: there's a very sad part, be cautious.Cheers.",False
11,7,Chasing the ghost of Ernest Shackleton,paul-allaer,n/a,17/08/2025,"As ""Endurance"" (2024 release; 103 min.) opens, it is ""1914 and we see grainy footage of Ernest Shackleton and his crew of 27 on the ""Endurance"" ship heading towards Antarctic. We then go to ""2022"" at the Weddell Island in the Antarctic, where a new expedition is hoping to find what remains of the Endurance shop wreckage at the bottom of the Antarctic. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary of Oscar-winning Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi (""Free Sole""). While this covers the nowadays expedition to locate the Endurance, the documentary is in fact also, if not more so, about Shackleton's 1914-1916 Antarctic expedition. It is an absolute amazing story in itself. Shackleton, light years ahead of others, realized that if it isn't filmed and photographed, it might just as well not have happened, and hence this documentary features lots of footage and photos of the 1914-1916 expedition (some of the footage has been colored, I might add). Bottom line for me is that I really enjoyed this, and that I will watch any documentary directed by the real life husband and wife team.""Endurance"" premiered last Fall, and is not streaming on Hulu, where I caught it the other day. ""Endurance"" is currently rated 70% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, which feels right on point to me. If you are in the mood for a great documentary about exploring the Antarctic in the early 20th century and nowadays, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False

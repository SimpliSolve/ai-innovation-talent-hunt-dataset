1,10,Losing is also a victory. Spectacular! Poetic!,rafabsilva,n/a,15/08/2025,"A profound film that knew how to perfectly blend reality with fiction. At the same time it showed a Laura Pausini humble in her greatness and happy with a normal life. The direction and editing of the film was on point. As for the photography, a show apart. Poetic images of the great Italy, intimacies of the singer and exclusive videos. I recommend it, to fans and the curious! Losing is also a victory, permeated with learning. Congratulations Laura, Prime Video, Endemol Shine and team!",False
2,10,A thrill for fans and a delight for those who don't know her,pauloborges-50588,n/a,15/08/2025,"The film tells the real story of singer Laura Pausini and how she Italian the world. It also has a beautiful reflection of what her life would be like if she weren't famous. It brings her face to face with an alternate reality and makes her question whether this is really the path she should have chosen. It's beautiful to see how music would be a part of her life regardless of which path she chose. The film is happy, musical and also makes us reflect on our life, our past and what we want for our future. I recommend!",False
3,3,Strictly for Laura Pausini fans...,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Laura Pausini: Pleasure To Meet You"" (2022 release from Italy; 90 min.) is a documentary about Italy's Celine Dion. As the movie opens, we are with Laura and her family as they are watching the Golden Globes awards live in February '21. When Laura is announced as the winner for Best Original Song, the entire extended family explodes with joy and tears. We then go back to ""Fall 1992"" as Laura, then 17, talks about growing up in Solarolo, performing in bars alongside her dad, and how she is invited to participate in the Sanremo song festival... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: let me state upfront that I had never head of Laura Pausini beforehand. I literally took a chance upon a ""suggested"" viewing by Amazon Prime based on my viewing habits (I love music, and I love documentaries). It turns out that Laura Pausini is Italy's response to Celin Dion, except that Pausini pretty much stays to her Italian roots, and amazingly becomes a superstar in much of Europe. It's all fine and well, except that I absolutely don't care for this kind of bland music-for-the-masses. As to Laura's personal story, I'm sure it's inspiring for some but it really couldn't hold my interest for very long. Bottom line: the AI that ""suggested"" this movie for me was absolutely 100% wrong. I gave it a generous 45 min (half the movie) but then simply had to bail, sorry.""Laura Pausini: Pleasure To Meet You"" recently premiered on Amazon Prime, and seems intended as an introduction to Pausini to a larger audience beyond her already existing fan base. Maybe it will do exactly that. I can only speak for myself, and I wasn't in the least interested in this film or in Laura Pausini. If you like Celin Dion's music, then I might suggest you give this a shot, and draw your own conclusion. For the rest of us, please stay away from this documentary.",False

6,10,I loved it!,iagoramosluiz,n/a,15/08/2025,The film is a nostalgic journey into the early years of the career of one of the most famous singers in the world. It's a treat for fans and an invitation to those who don't know her. The pleasure is all ours.,False

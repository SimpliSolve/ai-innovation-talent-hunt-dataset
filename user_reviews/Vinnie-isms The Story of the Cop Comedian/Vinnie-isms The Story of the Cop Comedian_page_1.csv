1,10,Hilarious and heartwarming,Lovely-58,n/a,16/08/2025,We need more stories like this showing the human side of law enforcement as well as great comedy!

2,10,Vinnie the Comedian Cop,sapdernest,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have had the opportunity to meet Vinnie in person and attend one of his comedy shows, that by the way, he donated 100% of the proceeds to charity. I then watched the documentary Vinnie-isms, all I can see is, what you see is what you get! Vinnie is a true hero in the sense that he risks his life serving as a law enforcement officer and someone who used the trauma of the job and makes others laugh through comedy, he is gifted and I highly recommend you take a look at the film. The film tells the story of a young boy with aspirations to always become a law enforcement officer. I had those same aspirations. It was so easy to relate to Vinnie throughout the film. There is a time to be serious and a time to be vulnerable and the film captures this so beautifully.",False
3,10,Vinnie-isms was a great watch!,imdbfan-641929,n/a,16/08/2025,"A worthwhile watch for sure! Funny, informational, and had a great flow.I have seen quite a few of Vinnie's posts on YouTube and Instagram, so I already knew he was funny, but this was great on a whole other level.Vinnie has a great backstory and they weaved in a good amount of his jokes and comedy into the documentary, so it had a good flow and kept my attention all the way through. Definitely worth the watch!I haven't had a chance to go see Vinnie in person at a show yet, but this definitely made it clear to me that I need to seek out his next ComedyWorks show that I can make and go see him!",False
4,10,Especially worthwhile watch for all first responders,Me-0763,n/a,16/08/2025,"Vinnie is a character to say the least. He found an outlet to support his own mental health and then broadened that to make the subject approachable and even fun to broach. His real life stories and antics from his days on patrol are hilarious but he also has a great message to share about taking care of yourself and others. His message extends to all police and other first responders who see and deal with a lot of hard $#*! And how it's important to find a way to deal with that stuff before it takes its toll. His family and friends give even more insight into this loud, loyal, taco loving, boisterous, teddy bear of an officer.",False

6,9,"Honest, Vulnerable, Funny!",LorraineO-28,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentarian Jason Harney's prior films have provided a window into many aspects of safety, mental health and family issues of law-enforcement officers but this unique documentary is something unexpected, refreshing and hopeful.Harney pulls back the curtain to shine humor, heart and humanity on the blue for all to see. Vinnie-isms: The Story of the Cop Comedian contains all the feels from funny to hearbreaking.Vinnie is a seasoned, strong, effective police officer-which can often land as a superficial stereotype of a human being. However, Vinnie moves beyond superficiality with his willingness to be honest and vulnerable both on stage and throughout this film.

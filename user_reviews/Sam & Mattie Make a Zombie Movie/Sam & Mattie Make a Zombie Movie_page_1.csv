1,9,A must watch for anyone with a soft spot and a sense of humor,AttorneyJenn,n/a,16/08/2025,"My family enjoyed every minute of both the documentary and movie which individually were great but together, made for an amazing experience. Sam and Mattie are such bright young men with a wicked sense of humor! We enjoyed learning about their lives, their family and friends, the obstacles they overcame professionally in order to make this movie, how the film was influenced by real life events and how folks rallied around them to make their dream a reality. Who knew this is just what we needed to renew our faith in humanity: Sam and Mattie's Spring Break Zombie Massacre.",False
2,8,Love Sam and Mattie!,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSince they met at the Special Olympics, Sam Suchmann and Mattie Zufelt have been best friends. Mich like the readers of this site, they're obsessed with movies and decided that it was time to make their own, filled with sex, violence and gore. And they totally succeeded.This is it pretty much the feel-good movie of all time.Sam and Mattie went on to storyboard, script, produce, cast and star in their dream project, which they called Spring Break Zombie Massacre.This is the story of how it all happened.Produced and directed by Sam's brother Jesse and Robert Carnevale, this movie intersperses the narrative of the film the guys made with the real stories that inspired it and moments of them actually making it.Perhaps the best part of the film is the fact that Sam and Mattie may not have made a movie that was a financial success, it was exactly what they wanted to do.This is a story filled with people smashing the expectation of disability, of communities being formed to help them and the joy of making a movie where Satan continually pisses all over people. It's also one of the happiest movies I've watched in some time, so if you need a pick-me-up, I recommend it with no reservations.",True

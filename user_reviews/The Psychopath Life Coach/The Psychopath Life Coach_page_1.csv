1,3,Narcissistic self promotion,nataliek-92972,n/a,16/08/2025,"This ""documentary"" seems more like a 1hr 26min advert for his life coaching business. It is not a well balanced insightful recounting but rather he comes across as an untrustworthy person who just wants you to like him.The ""documentary"" is repeatative and not engaging. I wouldn't recommend watching it as not educational or entertaining. When someone tells you who they are - trust them. Or in this case definitely don't.I gave it three stars only because the production is good quality. I am still very surprised to find something like this on netflix - who shouldn't have put it in the documentary category.",False
2,2,Don't waste your time.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lewis Raymond Taylor was a mess, a drug addicted alcoholic, who cruised through life, a friendly, happy go lucky guy that ended up behind bars, then giving people Life coaching.Seriously, if you or anyone else needs life tips and life coaching from this moron, then I genuinely feel sorry for you.The story about him being attacked was very sad, and possibly the reason for him found off the rails, but the combination of drink and drugs, I'm sorry the guy is just loathsome.Hard to understand why this ended up in Netflix, if you're a key to get through this, then good on you.Why on Earth does he think he's in any sort of position to give people advice, I genuinely detest guys like this.He now presents as a clean cut, well spoken, mild mannered guy, I don't buy it.Loathsome.2/10.",False
3,3,LEWIS: THUG. CULT LEADER & PYRAMID SCHEME MONEYMAKER,rivkasieff,n/a,16/08/2025,"This wasn't entirely disinteresting. Like most other reviewers on here I'm heartened to realise they see the con. I too was waiting for a twist. Most of us grow up unloved. We don't all want to hurt others. Is he doing what he's doing to genuinely help people? Or because its a good business model?Thank god for the one voice of sense here. The lady near the end. Apart from her it's all ""we love lewis"" ""he's christ...the redeemer"" Tacky matching tattoos which turns yourself into branded cattle and I would have like to have learnt how some people have turned their lives around but instead the documentary focused on how you too could be a life coach. Pay to be a life coach. Who gets the money? You're being mugged off by some geezer. It's a PYRAMID SCHEME. Look that term up before you think of investing.",False
4,1,Interesting!,movie_nerd_1998,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The Psychopath Coach"" is a documentary that masterfully delves into the complexities of the human psyche, illuminating the shadowy aspects of leadership and the ambiguous intersection of ambition and ethical limits. With compelling storytelling and enlightening interviews, it adeptly explores the fascinating realm of coaching, prompting viewers to ponder the fine line between brilliance and ruthlessness. What distinguishes ""The Psychopath Coach"" is its capacity to enthral and engage its audience, stimulating contemplation on ethical considerations. It seamlessly intertwines real-life narratives and expert commentary, offering a thorough yet riveting depiction of the intricate dynamics prevalent in high-stress coaching environments.",False
5,1,An advert... not a documentary.,qpropertyltd,n/a,16/08/2025,I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said - this is just a long advert for his coaching business. It starts by throwing in some back story (repeating the same thing over and over) then gets into the 'sell' which is basically a load of client testimonials repeating how much their lives have been changed by this company. I skipped 10 min chunks for the last 30 mins to see if it changed but nope just more and more self promotion. This whole documentary is to increase subscriptions and how Netflix signed off on this is absolutely mental. Save yourself the time and don't watch this you will never get the time back.,False
6,1,"Trailer is misleading, it's basically a long advert for The Coaching Masters",lou-28746,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe trailer for this looked like it would be a balanced, honest look at Lewis Raymond Taylor and his co-founded business ""The Coaching Masters"". But after a very repetitive 45-ish minutes of Lewis repeating how 'bad' he was and how many bad things he has done, the show then just talked about how the coaching businesses he's set up have brought in millions of pounds within the first three years, with multiple shots of him and his business partner in expensive cars or in exotic countries. It didn't feel like a documentary. It wasn't balanced at all, and it felt like the entire point of the show was to sell The Coaching Masters to potential clients. I stopped watching with 13 minutes left to go, as I was completely bored and liking Lewis less and less.If you enjoy sitting through long adverts that are trying to sell you products in an 'influencer' style then this is for you. However, if you like to watch a balanced documentary that doesn't make you feel like you're being recruited by a cult then I'd avoid this like the plague.",True
7,10,Transparent and true,jtvbp,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows all sides of Lewis Raymond Taylor, the story takes you on a journey from trauma to triumph. It's no pretty picture what a hard upbringing can do for someone and the documentary wasn't afraid to show it, it was very real and adding in the clips of Lewis as a young man trying to deal with his trauma was entertaining and sometimes shocking. It made the watch even more intense as it seemed impossible for anyone to turn around what he's been through. I think it portrays a great way of viewing the coaching industry through the eyes of Lewis and his ""haters"", showing both sides to the story. All in all it's a very inspirational story for the youth of today who feel lost and uninspired that they can also do something with their lives!",False
8,7,Fantastic Documentary 7/10,patriciaportelamota,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lewis's story is undeniably powerful, yet the documentary's narrative structure left me with mixed feelings. While it effectively navigates contrasting perceptions, there are moments where the storytelling feels disjointed. The inclusion of raw interviews adds authenticity, but the film could benefit from a more seamless integration of expert insights. Despite these considerations, the documentary successfully sparks contemplation on societal issues and personal growth. It's a good documentary to watch and reflect on your life, it was very well produced, congratulations to all the developers and Netflix for providing us with a wide range of entertainment options.",False
9,1,Why is this tool on Netflix,jmwharris,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolute drivel, abandoned ship 25 minutes before the end and that's still an hour my life im not getting back.Why do so many former wreck heads reach their thirties and decide to become life coachs? This would have been an interesting question for the filmmaker to have asked instead of churning out a 90 minute advert for the subjects latest get rich scheme. I assume this was funded quite probably in its entirety by the people that it's clearly delivering an advert for.Don't waste your time with this nonsense. At best click bait. Wish I'd have done literally anything else than watch this nonsense.",False
10,1,Pretty angry at Netflix,steven-duffield,n/a,16/08/2025,"Should have realised from the fact they included modern day inyerviews with the protagonist where this was going....The rest of these reviews are legitimate insomuch that after 40 mins this becomes a cheesy, cynical, unashamed cashgrab for this chancers business.It is breathlessley irresponsible, and misleading that Netflix has even allowed this onto the platform. This Lewis guy is basically just an unlikable barrow boy on the make. They draft in so called experts early in the 'mockumentary' looking into psycopathy and the tired old nature/nurture nonsense then Lewis hits you with his David Brent with a quiff and teeth schtick. They even refer back to the cheezy American life coaching industry... claiming this isnt what that is - which is them basically putting 2 fingers up to you - because they no that is exactly what it is.Disgusting shameful cash grab. It did motivate me... to switch it of.",False
11,1,Must-see if you enjoy infomercials,chia-58313,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs already noted by others, this is a commercial for a (frankly somewhat dodgy sounding) coaching program. In no way is this a balanced documentary of anything. This includes the details of the product they sell; we get many testimonials and vague soundbites, but learn nothing concrete on how it supposedly works. All peak infomercial tactics.We only hear one negative viewpoint about 5min before the end, and she is quickly cut off (how fitting).I'm glad the dude is doing better and all, but this was absolute drivel aimed at selling his services, and unless you're already a believer/considering parting with your cash, you probably won't get anything out of this. I watched this while cleaning the toilet and found the stains to be more intellectually stimulating.It's outrageous that this is marketed as a documentary.",True
12,1,Couldn't turn this off...for the wrong reasons.,peanut_bubba,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'll make this short because it doesn't really deserve my time, or yours.This is the story of every local chav you know, laced with the dramatic editing and sound effects which have become the staple of a Netflix documentary. These familiar tools don't manage to cut through the mundane and un-exceptional story of this self-aggrandizing, attention seeking and frankly dull man.I'll break down the entire story here. I was a bad kid at school, I had arguments with my dad, I started drinking at 16 (as do most kids in this country), I had some fights, I went on holiday to Ayia Napa (he calls this ""going travelling"" in the documentary - which is hilarious), had some fights on holiday and rented a scooter cause I'm a mad lad, came home and had some more fights, eventually I scammed people into the world of life coaching (after being released from prison).This is a story of mediocrity and the bleed-over success of the Andrew Tate business model of providing pyramid schemes to vulnerable people and calling it coaching. That being said it's barely a story at all, we've all had our ears chewed off by a bloke in the pub who likes to talk about how he's ""a psycho"" and ""blacks out when he gets angry"" and will ""take on anyone in the world"". Somehow, that bloke from the pub got an hour on Netflix and I promise you it will be a wasted hour in your life, just as it has been in mine.Tldr: avoid.",True
13,1,Netflix were conned too!,OscarOrange123,n/a,16/08/2025,"What is the message of this documentary? Become a thug, justify your actions by blaming others, and then exploit an easy-internet based global business market, to sail off into the sunset as a millionaire? Is an old and boring cliche message, you normally find on an Andrew Tate podcast. Not Netflix, but they were obviously duped too lol.The only person to speak any sense was the lady at the end - which Netflix included for 'balance'. I wasn't impressed at all by the 'Celebrity Psychologist' - that's his official title apparently. Gives you an idea of the intellect involved here.This was a poor performance by Netflix, and reflective of the times we live in.",False
14,1,A millionaires public self flagellation and Netflix sell out,pencilsandpens,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis 'documentary' is utter drivel and proves if you pay enough for it Netflix will play it. CEO Lewis spends most of this advert defending himself and trying to prove he's not a psychopathy despite being identified as having a personality disorder he refuses to get diagnosed. This man has trauma so it's somehow ok that he manipulated his brother into fighting and selling drugs.He praises himself as a genius for 'creating' the business model that many master manipulators use. We've seen it most recently in the actual documentary Escaping Twin Flames. It's a modern marvel that he became a life coach then figured he could get more money teaching people to become a coach. Then he got the innovative idea to sell coaching using an online course as passive income. Truly groundbreaking stuff that hasn't been seen before and hasn't been capitalised by platforms such as Skillshare and Masterclass.There are several plot holes with this 'documentary.'
Lewis mentions he woke up from surgery with a team of doctors stood above him proclaiming he healed himself. Where in the NHS do several doctors have time to stand over one patient a chat? Especially overworked surgeons on 24 hour shifts. Surgeons who are overworked because of pillocks like Lewis think getting your little brother beaten up is great backstory fodder for a Netflix infomercial.I am genuinely concerned for his wife who does not seem to understand that Lewis almost killed a man. She vaguely acknowledges his past as if all of us during our 'troubled years' punch someone so hard their brain bleeds out through their nose.But don't forget Lewis isn't a psychopath he's just a CEO 🤷‍♀️",True
15,1,This is an advertisement. Don't waste your time.,florian-78446,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this documentary is not just a waste of your time, but it also feels like a diminution of your life's quality. The entire production appears to be an elongated advertisement, promoting the central figure and his questionable business practices. What is particularly disappointing is the initial impression it gives - the first few moments seem to promise an in-depth analysis of his life, potentially highlighting some of the more controversial or negative aspects. However, this promise quickly dissolves, revealing the true nature of the film: a glorified, feature-length advertisement.It's concerning that such content finds a place on Netflix, a platform that was once celebrated for its high standards and quality selection. The inclusion of this documentary suggests a possible deviation from those standards, perhaps influenced by financial incentives from the subject of the documentary. This shift in content quality and editorial choice is alarming and raises questions about the integrity of the platform's selection process. The fact that Netflix, a leader in the streaming industry, would include such a biased and arguably low-quality documentary in its catalog is a disappointing development, suggesting a concerning trend towards prioritizing profit over content quality.This documentary not only fails to provide a balanced or critical view of its subject but also represents a broader issue in the streaming and entertainment industry, where commercial interests can overshadow the need for informative, unbiased, and high-quality content.",False
16,1,Do not watch,michaelbuckley-05364,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWorst thing to appear on netflix. Was presented as a criticism of the coach or an expose it is instead an hour plus long advert where all criticism is deflected and spun to give good light to the coach master cult. It is undoubtedly an absolute disgrace to grace the screen of everyday people and enables this toxic manipulative pyramid scheme to fish for more vulnerable people who may come across it. I would recommend watching paint dry before recommending this uninteresting, empty, manipulative promotional film. The protagonist the ceo of coach master tells of his traumatic childhood at the hands of his father ( he does not mention abuse to anyone else in the family as he most likely only cares for himself) that led him to drug abuse extreme violence to others. His stint in prison is also reflected in also as several people including himself describe how he is a ""genius"" and his mind works like nobody else in the world. During this he also takes the time to explain to us how he can cure many mental health issues including eating disorders and that he has a ""gift"". This film is extremely disturbing as it is the promotional film for a very obvious grift of a con man.",True
17,10,One we have to show young people.,thomashuntconstruction,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a documentary lover, this one shows the true meaning of how everybody is capable of change if they truly want too & even more in this case. A lot of young people can & will relate to this documentary. Young people who mess up will never feel like they can change paths. This is a must watch for everybody as it is never too late. Hats off to Lewis for showing how vulnerability and righting his wrongs and owning it!!I will be putting a lot of people onto this documentary as more people need to see what is possible. Look forward to following the journey Lewis embarks on and how many more people he can help.",False
18,7,exploration of personal growth!,deltasilvacanejo,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary had me captivated from beginning to end. Lewis's transformative journey in ""The Psychopath Life Coach"" is undeniably captivating, yet the pacing of the documentary left me occasionally feeling overwhelmed. The intricate web of contrasting perceptions is masterfully woven, but at times, the narrative seems to lose focus. The documentary successfully sparks introspection on societal truths and the human mind's complexities, yet some segments could benefit from tighter editing. Despite these considerations, the film remains an engaging exploration of personal growth, earning it a respectable 7/10.",False
19,1,Wasted 2 hours of my life,evivrl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a long advertisement of his coaching business. It starts with details about his life when he was younger, such as the trauma, he didn't have any support at home, he was addicted to drugs and alcohol and eventually ended up in prison. Then he talks about his coaching business and of course you see clips of his lifestyle as a successful business owner to join his business too and become a successful coach yourself. Finally, client's testimonials of how the coaching business have helped them become successful to convince you to buy his service, etc. This guy paid for a documentary about his coaching business which was then somehow ended up on Netflix (I assume he paid for that as well). The trailer is 100% misleading. I just wasted 1 hour and 26 minutes of my life watching this non sense.",True
20,1,Not a documentary,annique-26036,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe whole thing is an hour + long advertisement for a company and it shouldn't be labeled as a documentary.In the first 10 minutes they added snaps from interviews with people saying ""this is a cult"" and calling the founder ""egocentric"" and such, to lead people to think later on they would uncover what's really happening in this group but no, by the time you realize this ""documentary"" is just a super long ad for their company (don't even remember the name now) where they try to make this guy look like the best thing that's happen to the business world in decades, you'll sadly come to the realization you've wasted over a hour of your precious tv time when you could've been watching something actually interesting.Shame that Netflix would actually get this type of content and label it as a ""documentary"", we'll probably be getting other pyramids scheme garbage trying to trick people into their cults.",True
21,1,This is an ad not a documentary,ibbi-74411,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI agree with all the reviews here saying it's a 90min ad. I thought it had some sort of twist given it's on Netflix, but it doesn't. Once he gets to the end of his story, it becomes one long ad for his company. I'm incredibly disappointed with Netflix! I wrote my opinion about his so-called documentary on his instagram and now I'm blocked. What does that tell you about him and those working for him? What is his real intention? Oh yes, as he says himself at the end of his ad, he wants to be a Hollywood actor. Bravo Mr amazing life coach. I wonder how much money he paid for this marketing stunt.",True
22,1,An advert masquerading as a documentary.,ck-23398,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe story of a drug dealing violent bully, struggling with mental health issues due to an abusive childhood. Using that as an excuse to nearly kill people, whilst showing absolutely no remorse or guilt, proudly brags about how much money he's made profiting off the vulnerable through becoming a life coach.The first half is just a ruse, the second half is essentially an advert for his shady life coaching business. It's completely biased to Lewis's interests and point of view. Perhaps he used some of his infamous manipulating, he brags about, on the producers.Left a really sour taste in the mouth.Don't bother.",True
23,1,Tedious dross,bishopstonresident,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never written a review on IMDB before, but after wasting 45 minutes of this utter drivel, I felt compelled to sign up to warn others not to do the same. This is a low budget, low level infomercial about an extremely unlikable violent thug with no redeeming features. I can only presume he has self funded this documentary and has then paid to get it onto Netflix. I bailed halfway though, and that was after spending at least twenty minutes leading up to that wondering if the story was actually going to go anywhere. Nope. Just long-winded waffle about the teenage years of an awful human being behaving in awful ways. Do not watch this under any circumstances whatsoever. Its perhaps the worst thing I ever seen with my eyes.",False
24,1,Awful sales pitch,gary_holmes-59033,n/a,16/08/2025,"First time reviewing something on IMDb which says a lot. I'm gutted that I actually sat through the entire thing. 90 minutes of a narcissistic, smug business owner selling his own company and banging on about how great is basically.Any nuance around the guys story is provided 99% of the time by his own colleagues and customers. As such you can't help but feel that this is no more independent investigative journalism than the advert for McDonald's that came on immediately after I switched the thing off.If you want to be entertained, avoid this at all costs.If you want to learn something of value, avoid at all costs.If you want to see an ex-con smuggly parade his new extravagant jet setting lifestyle while moaning about daddy issues for 90 minutes, get stuck in.",False
25,1,Abysmal!,PaulReevo3000,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was the straw that broke the camel's back. This was the tripe that encouraged me to cancel my Netflix subscription after over a decade.The content on Netflix has been deteriorating at an alarming rate. However, it has generally been watchable rubbish. This abomination somehow slipped through the quality control department, which I can only now assume is non-existent.This is basically a lengthy advert for some shameful life-coaching scam sold to the misguided Facebook generation who think life coaches training other life coaches is feasible, and not a blatant pyramid scheme.Avoid this diabolical mess at all costs.Rumour is a company has been hired to vote this 6-10/10 to inflate the rating. It went from 1.3 to 3.6 in two days.",False

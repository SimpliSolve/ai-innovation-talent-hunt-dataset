1,8,A Sad Side Of The Harry Potter Movies,paulwetor,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'd read about the stuntman's accident, but this documentary fleshes out more of the story. It's moving, but also a testament to how much stunt work was done beforehand so that Daniel Radcliffe could perform it safely for the films.It's sad and scary to see how his life changed in an instant, despite all the precautions. The actual accident is not shown, which is a good decision by the filmmakers.Daniel Radcliffe is interviewed extensively, and it speaks well of him that he maintains connections that developed during the movies' filming.David's story isn't easy to watch, as a cyst also made his right arm less functional since the accident. But he carries on the best he can. His attitude is fairly upbeat, considering his circumstances.So many people came out of the HP movies better off, so it's fitting that somebody who came out worse gets acknowledgement for his efforts and unwanted sacrifice.",True

3,7,A moving and insightful new addition to the Harry Potter universe,eddie_baggins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Since it's first arrival onto cinema screens all the way back in 2001 (a cinematic event that reminds me how old I am now!), the wizarding world of Harry Potter has provided fans with a plethora of memorable on screen and off screen moments with the property and characters still just as popular today as they ever were.With a recent Harry Potter videogame, a much-liked reunion special that reunited members of the films as they celebrated the first films 20th anniversary and HBO's announcement that they are hard at work on a new series based off the original books, the amount of new and old Harry Potter stories coming our way shows no signs of slowing down with this years intimate and touching documentary David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived another important part of the Potter story.A true life tale that has not been one prevalent in the public realm, documentary filmmaker Dan Hartley and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe shine a light on the story of stuntman and Radcliffe stunt double David Holmes, an energetic performer whose life was changed forever on a fateful day of the Harry Potter film set when a stunt he was practising went very wrong, causing a spinal injury to Holmes that saw him forever bound to a wheelchair with no chance of regaining use of his legs or lower body.Providing us with an insightful look into both the world behind the scenes of the Harry Potter films, Holmes friendship with Radcliffe and other stars of the movies and then Holmes life as he comes to terms with his new world and a constant battle to remain positive in the face of adversity, Hartley's film may not do anything outstanding in a delivery sense or production sense but Holmes story is an undeniably effective one that is touching, uplifting and important.Showing just how much the Harry Potter film world has meant to not only viewers but those a part of it over the better part of more than a decade, The Boy Who Lived not only acts as a showpiece for Holmes's inspiring journey in the face of constant trials and tribulations but a testament to the special nature of the films themselves and what they did for those who helped to bring it too life and the camaraderie and family like bond between many involved in the productions is evident throughout this doco.A documentary that is likely to be an important piece of the overall Harry Potter puzzle in the film universe fandom sense and one that will engage those rare few who care little for J. K Rowling's creation but have interest in the exploration of the human condition, The Boy Who Lived is a noteworthy small-scale film with a big heart, deserving to be seen by a wide-ranging audience.Final Say -Proving that the stories from the wider universe of Harry Potter both imaginary and real show no signs of running out, David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived is an effective documentary that shows a genuine care for its subject matter and the world he was an important part of bringing to life.3 1/2 charity cricket matches out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",False
4,10,Incredible Story inside a larger story,icaremore,n/a,16/08/2025,I found it incredibly inspiring. I have spinal issues myself and I believe I've found who I need to model my attitude and struggle after. And I'm forty seven. Thank you David Holmes.

So thanks for sharing your life & friends with the world. This documentary will do special things for those struggling out there with traumatic injuries and large life challenges. I'm so glad to see the former Harry Potter cast mates you bonded with are still around.,False
5,10,What an amazing man,godsgiftwalshy_92,n/a,16/08/2025,Honestly as a massive Harry Potter fan I never knew about David Holmes. What an amazing human to have such a great look on life with what happened. To do what you love every day being so active then to not be able to walk I can only imagine how hard that must be. Your an inspiration to anyone in your situation. I always wondered why Daniel Radcliffe wanted to distance himself from Harry Potter once the films were over and now I can imagine why it must of been hard with what happened. What a lovely friend to David and to stick by him through all the hard times seeing him like he is now must be so hard.Such a lovely documentary which I will remember for a long time.,False
6,7,Well Produced,jace_the_film_guy,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fascinating dive into the tragedy that happened to David Holmes. The documentary is well-produced and packed with interesting information. It's also full of hope and optimism, especially from David.The story is especially sad when you look at Greg and others on the set. The fact that they carried on, is a feat in itself. What Marc and Tolga have been able to do after the completion of the films is incredibly admirable.Seeing the support of everyone in the Harry Potter cast, especially those like Tom Felton and the Weasleys, is something to marvel at.Well worth the watch, even with the 20+ F-bombs.",False
7,10,Very touching,mc_segurado,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved that we got the chance to see a part of the films that we've never seen before, even though it is not a happy part at all. This was a very emotional documentary for me, as I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. It was hard not to share a tear on the entire story. Daniel Radcliff is a great human being and it shows the compassion and empathy he has for everyone. He stayed so humble even after all the fame he got. David Holmes has a great strong spirit, even at a young age he was so inspiring and always had a positive attitude towards everything in his life.This documentary inspired me so much. I hope these two ""boys"" have the best life they can have.",False

9,10,some people just...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAre nt born under a lucky star, a simple fact that i the grumpy old man also made a testimony trip to the broke-back mountain, though lucky enough to not to break the telephone cord that relays signals from A-B, so i might live under a rare lucky doublestar system that kept me away from T2-paralysis for the rest of my life...so david i can agree that the hell of pain of spinal damage is excruciating, a spell that you rather want to throw to people you hate most in life.Also remember that anyhow you got your injuries, that doesnt mean that you should let yourself be eaten up by the pain it causes, cause pain aint the holy grail of mending up. So as one radio D. J once said, '' just eat it , just beat it'', that has given me some durable bonus years after the ''cataclysmic'' events of mine.I'm a medical nurse by profession, and ive seen a lot of rehab work that has gone bad due to antimedicine oaths, therefore give yourself a chance along with your medical staff, it might change your already reduced options of life...a bittersweet story about the stunt double who had a ''hag-shot''(hekseskudd in my language) in his neck, and just another reminder how frail a human life may be.",True
10,7,Review for David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived,Reviews_of_the_Dead,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a documentary that Jaime and I watched while we were in the hospital after the birth of our second child. It was difficult to hear due to the speaker being attached to the call light. We made due between that, doctors, nurses and our newborn needing our attention. This was decided on due to not fully needing to pay attention.Now what we're getting here is a documentary about Harry Potter's stunt double of David Holmes. It is interesting how close he looked to Daniel Radcliffe during that time. We learn about Holmes' upbringing and what got him into being a stunt double. It was quite interesting since we all know that phenomena that Harry Potter was. Radcliffe looked up to Holmes due to him having a cool job and being older. That is until the tragedy struck.The big thing here is about a stunt that went wrong. It left Holmes paralyzed. Something that touched me here was that Radcliffe and Holmes have stayed close. The former is in this more than I expected. Not only is he being interviewed, but he is interacting with Holmes as well. It makes me like him as human even more. This does get emotional to see what Holmes goes through to try to prevent deterioration within his body. He also is staying positive and trying to do what he can to better the world around him as well.I'll then just finish out by saying that this is well-made. It is professionally done. I do like hearing from Holmes, his parents and peers from when he was working. He touched the lives of many as they're still friends which says something about him. Giving us a bit of the good before revealing the tragedy works to hook you. Then showing his journey was also good. I would recommend this one to people intrigued by more behind the scenes stories. Also, if you are a Harry Potter fan, this is an interesting one to check out as well.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",False
11,10,Wow!,andymorland,n/a,16/08/2025,"It hit me harder than I expected. I don't really get tearfull but bloody hell, tears in my eyes for a good part of this. What a guy David is, plus all his mates are such a nice bunch of lads. As always Dan Radcliffe comes across a really nice bloke. I would recommend this, although it's not necessarily an easy watch, but definitely worth it it, it makes you think about how fragile the human body is and a neck injury is just a terrible thing to happen, and I tell you what, a lot of people wouldn't have coped with it as well as Dave did, so there is a lot to be admired from him. Again like I said it hit me quite hard.",False
12,7,David Holmes,yusufpiskin,n/a,16/08/2025,"David Holmes is among those we feel we know without truly knowing. In truth, all stunt doubles inhabit this paradox. They are the ones in our favorite films, executing the awe-inspiring scenes we adore, yet we lavish praise on actors who may not even have been on set-artists who expended none of the effort. This is why David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived is both a vital and masterfully crafted work, illuminating its subject with unflinching clarity.Watching David Holmes grapple with his circumstances-his defiance, acceptance, self-reproach, and self-compassion-alternately shatters your heart and mends it.And then there's Daniel Radcliffe... Over the past two decades, as the internet's ubiquity has laid bare the monstrous flaws of countless idols, our faith in celebrities has eroded. Yet Radcliffe, at just eight years old, vowed, ""I'll never become one of those famous people."" This documentary reveals a man who has kept that promise. Radcliffe is, unequivocally, one of the good ones.",False
13,10,Very touching documentary,alexglimbergwindh,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very touching documentary that makes you respect stuntmen a whole lot more.You never think about how many stuntmen actually do all the dangerous stuff you see in screen in this day of cig animations. The amount of skill, training and effort that takes to get this level of fitness and competence.Imagine being an actor earning millions, and stuntmen that risk their lives to make said actors look cool and earn all those millions of dollars, make such a little cut of all of it. They are very under-appreciated and I wonder what we could do to improve their standards of reward.Stuntmen are awesome.",False
14,10,Heartbreaking and heartwarming,Missastro2023,n/a,16/08/2025,"I created an IMDB account just to review this at 10 stars. It was heart breaking and heart warming all at the same time. I am really glad I decided to watch this today as it's worth anyone's time. David's story and attitude are beyond admirable and inspiring. He reminds you of what is important in life and he inspires you to keep things in perspective and be a better person, all through his beaming personality, abundant kindness and acceptance of an actual living nightmare situation and through his continued drive, passion and motivation for life, friends, family and even the activities he loves but can no longer participate in himself. Definitely leaves you sitting in awe and a lot of feelings when the credits roll.",False
15,10,Amazing and incredibly moving,Sky4021,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh wow what an amazing man he is,strong willed incredible and at first so it seemed invincible then the worst thing in the world happened and my god my heart broke for him,David had no fear and there was no stopping him!,the documentary had me in tears in parts my heart broke for him he had everything and just like that his world fell apart,he is amazing!to go through so much and he still stays strong positive and determined,the friendship they all had was beautiful to see the emotion when they all spoke about David was so hard to watch you just wanted to jump in the tv screen and cuddle him was a very hard watch but he still tries to live his life to the fullest he is amazing I just can't say it enough,if you happen to see these reviews David I have so much admiration for you you are incredible.",False
16,10,"Wow, wow, wow! A MUST see",bpxvcxwn,n/a,16/08/2025,"His story is so inspirational. Offers a unique perspective and insight on keeping a positive mindset. Sharing the behind-the-scenes stunts he did will give you a new appreciation for what was done in the movie. He sets the bar for how all humans should strive to live.Showing some of the physical struggles that he deals with on a daily basis done with a class and grace that should be the gold standard. It's heartwarming to see how all of his coworkers, friends and mentors, have stood by him, and supported him over the years, out of the limelight. If you love the movies and our Harry Potter fan, this will give you a much deeper appreciation for what was achieved on screen.",False
17,10,David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived,hotwheelerd-52603,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI came across this Document and I watched it. I Loved it my son had me watch Harry Potter. I have not watched it in years because of my work schedule. Now I can't work I have the time. Then I came across this Document and watched it and was blown away because I Love my film's. And David Holmes was his personal stunt man started at age 11 years old gets into a injury and breaks his back in like the 4th film and he is in a wheelchair and comes back as his personal stunt man and finished all the Harry Potter Films. Some people do get upset and some people don't. But those two do not. They remain to be friends today and still go to gyms and stuff and talk with little kids on to keep safe and all kinds of stuff. When they do that the jyms go crazy and the kids ask so many things about the Harry Potter Films. And are going more crazy that the man that can't walk anymore is the stunt man. But use to work in jyms and all kinds of cool places. Sometimes it is your Job that you have to be careful of.,True

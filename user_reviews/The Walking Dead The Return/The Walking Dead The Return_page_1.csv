1,9,"""Going down memory lane with someone with no memories.""",striklix,n/a,15/08/2025,"This might actually be the sweetest and most heartwarming thing I've ever watched? Like genuinely seeing the sheer amount of care and work and just overall passion both of these people put into bringing these characters to the screen and the way they brought out the differing dynamics between them, from their disagreements to the insanely high chemistry that developed. It's such a treat to get to experience these two (mostly Danai) talk about their experiences on the show, reminiscing about specific scenes and especially specific actors and how much they enjoyed working with them - the most notable for me being the way they talked about Chandler Riggs as Carl (especially Andy), and the way that both of them praised the incredibly gifted Steven Yuen. Honestly just one of the most enjoyable trips down memory lane as the two most iconic characters in my watched television history go through important old locations that they filmed on, and then gush about the events in the story or the other actors or crew that helped them bring it all to life. Plus it's always a bonus for me to be able to hear Andrew Lincoln's silly English accent because I cannot take it seriously coming from a man who looks like that, and has always sounded like Rick Grimes to me.Obviously if you like any part of the walking dead series, especially that which includes what are arguably the two best parts of it as a whole, this really short little documentary is indeed a must watch. Perfect to watch either before or after you watch The Ones Who Live as well - as it doesn't spoil any of that show but it does give you even more Rick and Michonne content, that just consists of the two actors being the most adorable people in the world and clearly showing their appreciation and dedication to something that was so important for so many people, including me. Highly highly recommend checking this out for yourself, even if you never plan on watching the new mini series this is unequivocally a very fun time filled with laughs and two fantastic actors having a whole ton of fun.",False

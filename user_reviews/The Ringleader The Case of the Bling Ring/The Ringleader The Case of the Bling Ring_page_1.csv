1,7,Informative,corinawonder,n/a,16/08/2025,"I read other reviews and I must comment how I see this kind of documentaries. I start watch it just cos I have teen I want to understand better. Luckly mine is not obsessed with celebrities or stuff, but its good to know. Its good to watch for anyone who like to understand others, where things come from for others, why someone is they way it is, what make them change etc. I dont think its meant to praise anyone, but it is super learning tool for anyone who study human heads or wish to understand human behavior better. I feel empathy for this girl, I think she still have a lot to learn, but life is learning path and everyday we learn something new till we live, its important to have will to do better every new day and never stop working on yourself. She embraced her failure and learn from it and its best thing she can do. Some of us must do it hard way, and its way better lesson then easy way. (Excuse my selftought English)",False
2,6,Much better than Netflix,iseepinkelefants,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed this one much more than the Netflix version. I remember not liking Nick, and now we know why. If Rachel was just putting on an act in this she did a good. I came away liking her immensely and hoping for the best for her. Which is much more than I can say for her cohorts in the other doc. If someone learns and grows that's the best that can come out of a terrible situation. I don't fault them per se for what they did; the 2000's were a terrible time. I'm sure many decades have their own version of this but it was definitely a vapid time. As someone who went to a posh wealthy high school whose family wasn't as rich, I could empathize with her. The difference between me and her was I didn't care. But that didn't stop me from having a short lived designer purse phase. We can't fault people for doing anything to obtain a lifestyle that American society forces us into accepting. I'm lucky I now live in Paris because consumerism is not a thing I have to deal with anymore. Despite its reputation no one is obsessed with labels. It's a shame America is still pushing that narrative. Good for Rachel for learning that the hard way.",False
3,1,Junk,iheartkatherine-63006,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a waste of time! Yet again we have a criminal profiting off their crimes and I'm so sick of it. I thought would be watching what really happened and how things transpired but this is just cam footage of a girl walking and scenes with a bunch of shopping trips and goes on and I. About how people become famous over nothing which how this person is famous and I can't say anything good about this only that she only blames herself and now knows what she did was wrong and seems like she is done stealing and causing problems but only time will tell who cares anyway? Make a documentary on what happened then I may watch it.,False
4,4,Same dilemma :,orcinussr,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a documentary, does one review the subject or does one review the elements of the film, the production et al?In this case I'll start with the subject, although that's unfair because given that the filmmaker choice is subjective and thier prowess will prove to make the film interesting or intriguing or whatnot, I've always felt opining on the subject matter is, in a sense pointless - ya know it's either something the viewer is interested in or notAnd on a personal level, and I want to emphasize that this is apart and independent of my feelings about Rachel Lee and the so called 'Bling ring' but I am vehemently opposed to all of these criminals (whether they've served thier time and ""paid their debt"" or not) essentially being rewarded financially by being the subject in thier own documentaries and often being lauded by the public as infamous heroes for lack of better terminology - I believe as a society we need to stop holding them up as legendary individuals worthy of our respect or 'worship' and whilst this isn't necessarily the case with Rachel Lee, it is worth pointing out that her stating that she wished to remain unrecognizable and out of the current collective zeitgeist (again) she IS IN FACT doing this documentary for HBO! So one must ask themselves, is it for a hefty payday to lure them out of semi anonymous safe haven of post incarceration OR does she still seek some of the infamy and attention that drove her to the crimes she admits to? (if it's the former, why are we so fascinated and starved for content, that we permit what is in my opinion ultimately a reward for her actions)All in all I am, whilst being a male born in LA and raised in Bel Air (even attending a school that had its own continuation school called Indian Springs which we referred to as Indica Springs cause ya know... Right?) and having some empathy in those regards, first hand understanding of that environment of interacting with celebrity yet not being anything extraordinary - and of course merely being a human that was a teenager at some point but ultimately I'm unimpressedBy both the film AND Rachel Lee// as an afterthought, and this is kinda funny and kinda like.. remember I said I had some empathy but not much sympathy, so get this, when I was still in elementary school, there was a kid on my street that had a bad reputation, I can attest he was a bully and, let's say ne'er-do-well. So for a stretch of time there were burglaries in bel air and eventually my family returned from vacation and the house had been robbed - there was a huge greasy palm print on my bedroom window (I had nightmares for months, I was a kid, gimme a break lol) so anyway it turns out that when the caught the gang of kids that did it, that boy was the main dude right? Turned out he went on to have a fairly successful career as an actor - and cause I don't think anyone will read this far I'll tell you his name (we're already on imdb, check him out, you totally recognize him) David Bowe, his girlfriend and Co. Robbed houses AND the school in bel air hahaha - what a Richard right? Funny stuff! Sorry David, some people don't forget.",False

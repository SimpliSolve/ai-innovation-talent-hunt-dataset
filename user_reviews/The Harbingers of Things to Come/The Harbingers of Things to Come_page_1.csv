1,9,Compelling movie,john-570-355877,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie makes you think about your own life and what's to come. Our world is moving fast towards total destruction, held together by God's hand of blessing. Jonathan explores where we've been and where we're going, and what will happen if we don't repent as a nation. It's a powerful portrayal of our world today.",False
2,10,A MUST SEE!,eespinoza-41491,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was incredible and mind blowing! So many connections that can not be denied, or are hard to deny! I encourage everyone to see this if you haven't already and if it's still available in theaters. Hopefully there will be a DVD or digital release soon.",False
3,10,Humbly turn back to God,horses-02470,n/a,16/08/2025,I was given the first book as a gift from an older couple that felt led to give it to me. It is signed by you Jonathan.It took me 4 months till I read it.We will meet someday. I am fearless to shine for Him.Read rev 18:23. The end of the Bible. It says that the economic system will be brought down by pharmacy.This book and movie exactly follow the ancient prophecies and show us the uncanny connections of both dates and spiritual utterances between God's relationship to both ancient Israel and America. He clearly opens our eyes to the revealings for such a time as this.Amazing calling my friend. Keep going. I pray for you. One day we will meet.Daniel McClure.,False
4,1,Terrible,polleyt,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTurned this on not knowing anything about it really. Typical Nostradamus revisionist bologna. I'm not even done with it yet but I'm not sure I can finish.Spoiler: A tree died, so America is doomed. It's in the Bible.Spoiler: Covid happened because of abortion. It's in the Bible or something. Also Covid happened because they lit the freedom tower with a pink light?If only this guy could have warned us of the coming ""calamities"" (he says that word too often and it's driving me a little crazy) and told us that if we outlaw abortion dont plant some tree in NYC that died we'd be here Covid free and 9/11/2001 would have been a regular forgettable day.",True
5,10,Very interesting and compelling!,ptalaustin,n/a,16/08/2025,"This video will give you much to think about. Too many ""coincidences"" to be coincidental, from 9/11 to the pandemic, you will be shocked and amazed. I highly recommend it. There was so much content and went a bit fast so I'm going to see it again! Don't miss this. I feel this is a warning from God to turn to Him, give your life to Him before it's too late. Time is of the essence and this world is very temporary. We are only passing through.",False
6,1,Why? America why?,hxqkyzn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Where do I start? The mayflower? Is that the reason that so many Americans are so bible bashing crazy? Crikey Moses get over yourselves - according to this pile of steaming faeces the rest of the world doesn't exist - he picks and chooses points to make - basically the good ole USA is ancient Israel reinvented - yeah okay. Lots of weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth - Old Testament fans. Pure steaming poo, plus he is a little creepy as a narrator I can just imagine him wearing Jesus sandals. This is a stretch. Shame he didn't actually predict any of this until after the event. Well at least Europe is out of this - yawn.",False
7,10,Mind blowing... Intriguing,joecapone,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jonathan takes you on a journey through events past and present weaving through the reverberations of the Word of God and commonalities between Israeli and American cultures and nations..more importantly the warnings that tend to be drowned out by the principalities, powers and rulers of the darkness of this world. Come prepared... leave ignited to return to our first love.. the only One True God of the Universe.",False
8,1,A conspiracy wackos bs. If it were satire it'd be funny,Blumanowar,n/a,16/08/2025,"A conspiracy wackos bs. If it were satire it'd be funny.

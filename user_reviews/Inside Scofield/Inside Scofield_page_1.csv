1,10,A journey into Jazz Guitar Master John Scofield's mind and soul,crouchphilip,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thought it was great that Pat Metheny did the introduction to the film as he is a modern jazz guitar master as well, and to hear him speak so highly of John was very much an affirmation of his being deserving of having a film made about him as a Master Jazz Guitarist.It was really cool to see him and Vicente go to that Guitar Shop and have that jam session with John playing that resonator guitar with Vicente playing an upright bass. Later on they show the two of them playing backstage with the same setup. I think that John must have bought the resonator guitar. The footage of Combo 66 performing live is awesome; especially the way that Joerg stopped the footage on each band member as in a still, while John talked about each band member. I thought it was cool how John commented that each band member plays as good, if not better than he does. Especially drummer Bill Stewart, who he says plays some of the best solos of the night. Being a jazz guitarist myself, I understand the Road Dog chapters; Jazz music isn't very popular in the United States, so understandably John has to tour in Europe quite a bit and some in the U. S. But what I didn't understand was how much work it is for him! Seeing the airport layovers, canceled or delayed flights, lost guitar! Vicente's lost bag, train rides etc.. Also, John mentions that on this US tour with Combo 66, there was only one venue on the tour that had four nights. All the rest were one night only gigs. That really hit me! Travel to the gig and then have to sleep and then fly or drive to the next gig. It's a real grind! , and he goes through all of it for those two hours on stage playing. I also love that Joerg filmed John at his home in Katonah.I loved how John told the story about growing up in Ct. (Westport) I think? And it being an hour away he was able to take a train into New York City. I realized early into this film that it was meant to be for John to be a Jazz Guitar Master! The only sad part was that scene where he's walking in Manhattan explaining that where the were guitar stores, now there are office buildings. Also, there are less jazz clubs in New York City than there where when he first moved there, as he said in 1975. I Love the scene where he's at home looking through his cd's and he talks about how there are mistakes on them but not really! As a jazz guitarist myself, I totally get that point! Because, you listen to the record and it just becomes part of the tune. Or as Miles used to say, ""play it twice and they will think that you meant play it"" Another great chapter in the film is about his friends in Jazz. They are all great Jazz musicians -the Combo 66 band- Bill Stewart, Vicente Archer, Gerald Clayton, Steve Swallow, Mike Stern, Bill Frisell, Jon Cleary, Phil Lesh, Dave Holland, Dennis Chambers, Joe Lovano, Bill Evans, Pat Metheny and Road Manager Pat Murray. Each one gives great praise to John Scofield and that says it all! Some of my favorites are Steve Swallow who says that"" John's playing has a lot of starts and fits and is like real life"" or something like that. Pat Metheny who says that there is a real truth in John's playing -like"" now your going to hear the truth- this is my story"" Mike Stern says "" John's playing is courageous and very creative"" or something to that effect. All of the commentary of these great jazz artists about John I agree with wholeheartedly! As a jazz guitarist myself, I know how hard it is to not only play jazz guitar, but to have your own unique style and sound is the ultimate goal and very difficult to accomplish, and John has done that. I am truly happy and grateful to Joerg Steineck for making this film as I have gotten so much inspiration from it and I hope that it gets enough attention so that it will eventually be aired on television.",False

3,10,A National Road Dog Treasure,elevationpressbooks,n/a,15/08/2025,"A satisfying in-depth profile of one of music's true legends. Sights and sounds with backstage footage and jazz, jazz, jazz. A treat not only for the guitar aficionado, but also a window into a world which the uninitiated will be inspired to explore. Hats off to Joerg Steineck for filming and recording this insightful journey into the heart and mind and talent of one of the last of the true road dogs. Visually stunning, ""Inside Scofield"" is a not-to-be missed adventure of sight and sound. A timely, contemporary glimpse into the grit and determination required to launch and maintain a lovingly-crafted career in the challenging and heady world of the traveling musician.",False
4,10,Outstanding!,campkittleson,n/a,15/08/2025,This a great documentary about one of the best musicians around. It is a great behind the scenes look at the less than glamorous life on the road and the incredible dedication it takes to live the jazz life. Check it out! I have seen John several times over the years and have been amazed by the consistent high quality of the music he produces in all sorts of settings. It's so nice to see this music documented with the respect and sensitivity that this uniquely American art form deserves. I've been a big Scofield fan for years but to hear so many outstanding musicians talk about him in such glowing terms shows the respect he commands amongst his peers.,False
5,10,Great film.,neilcummings-37439,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a great film. It shows how musicians cope with life on the road and raise their game every night to play inspired and inspiring music.Scofield is a fantastic musician who has really forged his own way. His playing has developed over the years and he still digs deep to say what he has to say. The band in the film all play great together and they get better as the tour goes on.If you ever get the chance to see John Scofield in concert then I would recommend it. He plays in a number of genres always with a lot of improvisation through it.The film has a good balance of great performances, dialogue and insight into the lives of those featured.Check it out.",False

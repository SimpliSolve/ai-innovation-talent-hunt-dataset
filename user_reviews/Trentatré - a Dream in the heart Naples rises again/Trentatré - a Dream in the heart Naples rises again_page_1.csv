1,9,Victory and redemption.,chiacorr,n/a,16/08/2025,"At first glance, this is a documentary about the Napoli Football team and the third championship victory. It captures the opinions and range of emotions that fans experience - from the moments of doubt and superstition to the joy that almost violently dominates the whole city. However, by focusing on the words of those who lead this film, those who live and deal with this city and sometimes are even subject to it, we can understand what lies behind this passion (obsession) for football and the team.Hence, winning the championship is winning over unfairness, over poverty, over racism, over shame, over life itself. That is why the victory of SSC Napoli became the victory of Naples.As a Neapolitan, my relationship with this city has always been ambivalent and as someone who does not identify as a fan, I have always looked at how its locals experience football with doubt and detachment. As such, I do not think I am biased in saying that it was surprisingly refreshing to watch this documentary and to find so much truth in it.'You have to live there to understand what this is all about.'Watch it! ðŸŒ‹",False

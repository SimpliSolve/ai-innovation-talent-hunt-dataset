1,7,Excellent behind the scenes look at a major sports club,bbosma-24403,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've watched a few of these - Sunderland till I Die was also excellent, and I'm enjoying Welcome To Wrexham (which is a little different, since it follows a non League club after it was purchase by two Hollywood stars). Feyenoord is one of Holland's great clubs and, along with their great rival, Ajax, have also had a big impact in Europe over the years. But in this documentary, it's a tough year for the club, struggling financially because Covid lockdowns have them playing in an empty stadium, and also struggling on the field. In a way, it's the less successful times that make these kinds of documentaries more interesting - the human frailties are so much more on show. You see the players as not privileged, well paid elites but vulnerable humans whose careers are constantly on the line. The Dutch league is not super wealthy like the English, Spanish and Italian leagues, so clubs struggle to hold onto their best players, which can also be emotional for fans - who also play a big part in this series. Well worth watching, and not just for lovers of sport.",False

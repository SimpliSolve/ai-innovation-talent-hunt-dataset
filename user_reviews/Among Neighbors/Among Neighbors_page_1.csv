1,10,Touching and thought provoking,GadiC-8,n/a,16/08/2025,"What does it mean to be human? How do we humans act under pressure and at difficult times?See the film and the different alternative answers, they are all in each and every one of us.A touching story and creative story telling only reality can bring us viewers. The combination of animation is any thing but brilliant.I watched the film with tears and fluctuations of fillings. From sad to angry, from suspense to relief.An interesting way for people that now about the holocaust to learn more and deepen their prespective,as well as for those that have little knowledge but want to learn about the holocaust and the human condition.Highly recommended !!!",False
2,10,brilliant new documentary of creative style and unique historical perspective. a must watch to really understand the second world war and the holocaust.,ShakedK-9,n/a,16/08/2025,"A remarkable magic of documenting work that took over ten years and shows the unexpected remedy of two people who refuse to forget. Pieces come together only through the skill of the film-maker contrary to the forces of deniel and conformity and old age.Elegant combination of animation and live shots which form a moving blend of past and present. The absence of material from the period says everything about the attempt to hide, to forget. But there is no forgetting thanks to this film.It is a testement to deep darkness that was in peoples hearts against the current wave of history-editing. Must watch!",False
3,10,Loved it,ReuvenD,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTouching and a beautiful ending. Amazing animations and very enjoyable, I had the privilege to talk to the director of the movie and Ya'akov's son. Incredible experience. I heard the story of the movie's making and it was a lot of fun and very interesting. I will be doing more research into Poland's situation after watching. Overall a very informative and touching movie. I live in Israel and have seen quite a few Holocause movies, but this one was special somehow. I really moved me, and it conveyed the message it was trying to convey incredibly well. Very well done to Yoav and his crew. Super good movie.",True

1,1,oh dear...,peterfirside,n/a,16/08/2025,"I visited America back in 2015, and I was really taken with the diversity and intelligence of the people I met. So why did they pick these people to make this show. To begin with I thought they must all be on weed. ""Dude"" this and ""Bruh"" that. Getting hysterical over things that don't even show up on all their high tech equipment. Things that only they see but the high tech equipment fails to do so. It is like all the worst bits from programs that fail to show anything and then made into a concentrated fluid and spurted out all over my senses. My only conclusion to this regurgitated pile of dung is that these people have spent to much money on weed and then realized that they need more money, so they made this. It makes me sad that people are going to watch this and get this stupid impression that America is like this. Trust me it isn't. I was very very disappointed. Terrible. Watch it and tell me differently...please.",False
2,2,Disappointed,kathiwilmoth,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was disappointed, I like the shows with Kelly, the shows with Jacks friends are like where's Scooby Doo. It's like a stoner party, not a scientific in investigation. Jack, you can do better. Make more shows with Kelly, the show with your Mom was Okay.I am very interested in the Skin walker , I watch all the shows I can find on the subject. I've watched every episode of 'The Skin walker ranch' shows. I believe the Indian folklore to be true. Travis Taylor brings some legitimacy to the show, the ' dude's just Don't do that, Jack, you can do better. I DO want to believe, help me to believeSorry ðŸ˜”",False
3,7,The interest is sincere,letelliertammy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I understand adding levity and lightness to these investigative shows, as long as there is focus when investigating if they want it all to be taken seriously. I did enjoy watching this episode. Such an intriguing subject. One thing I always wonder is why these types of investigations don't have a drone with night vision ready to fly whenever there is something in the distance, at ground level, that isn't recognizable. It seems that would be the best way to capture images of these entities or people or beings... whatever they may be. Anyway, keep being curious and keep investigating. You never know when you will capture something that may complete the puzzle!",False
4,8,Funny & interesting.,latasha-60050,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed this, due to the humour these guys bring, after watching a lot of serious ufo encounter shows-like aliens in Alaska -the Alaskan triangle - big foots & what not.Good for a laugh how brave they're behaving looking for scary stuff in the dark & a bit boganish.I believe it but I'm not going looking.",False

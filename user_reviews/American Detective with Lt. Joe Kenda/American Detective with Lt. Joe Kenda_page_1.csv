1,9,ðŸ’¯ Bang Up Crime Show,patricia-haertlein,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is truly the best of the best. Joe Kenda was tapped to emcee master homicide detectives' most memorable cases across the country. Beginning with Joe Shillaci in Miami, you have to LOVE this show. Trust in what I'm saying. It gets no better than this!",False
2,9,Background music,rpasmail,n/a,16/08/2025,"Does anyone listens to these shows before they are released? The background music is louderr than the people talking. There is no reason to play drama music the entire show. If you think it does, you need to fire some writers and producers. Love the shows, but get so irritated with trying to hear what they are saying that I shut it off and watch something else.",False
3,7,Sound of show,maranellmike,n/a,16/08/2025,Love anything with Joe Kenda. But this new show American Detective is hard to hear and understand the people talking. TOO MUCH BACKGROUND SOUND!! Otherwise pretty darn good.,False
4,10,Who doesn't love Joe??,Disco_Billy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was saddened to learn that Homicide Hunter was going away, but pleased when Mr. Kenda stated he would probably see us soon on the last episode. So, I was excited to see the new American Detective with Lt. Joe Kenda. The episodes are in a similar vein as HH, but with other detectives' cases, and well done. Of course, the main draw for me is Mr. Kenda's narration. Not sure why, but his narration and facial expressions provide a great deal of entertainment. Well, my my my!",False
5,10,Just watch this and see why we need law enforcement!,kfboyde,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent, excellent. Love Joe and his one-liners and he shows us great cops!",False
6,10,Excellent Show with excellent content,cdthompson-84351,n/a,16/08/2025,Have to give kudos to Joe with him saying he was not the only one who answered the call. He is a totally good guy to put away any arrogance that one might have being the reality star and Honor all who serves or served !!! AAA+ Guy.,False
7,10,Spectacular,abhaymohanklari,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched the first two episodes and its excellent
I have already emotionally invested in this show
Waiting for the other episodes",False
8,10,Joe Kenda is an amazing story teller!,mexicanmoon16-809-24579,n/a,16/08/2025,"He's just great...better than great! I love his original show, Homicide Hunter, but It's also nice hearing him tell other detectives stories. Also, the show is really well put together, great writers, guests and actors with easy to follow/understand stories.",False
9,10,Excellent show,jeano-79377,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm addicted to Joe Kenda's American Detective and Homicide Hunter shows. Joe lays it out bluntly and does an excellent job in narrating this show and sharing his perspective in Homicide Hunters. I'm a big fan of Joe Kenda!,False
10,n/a,Turn down the music !,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is it just my tv because I can hardly hear the people talk on several channels because they drown them out with all the loud music !!! Including I. D. channel !!! Geeeeze!:'""""""__+()/)&",False
11,6,Too much background noise,susan_warr,n/a,16/08/2025,The show is ok. Reminds me of Homicide Hunter but not quite as good. The background noise makes the show hard to follow and it is rather annoying. Why do you need that music? It adds nothing to the program. Hopefully future shows will have this corrected.,False
12,10,Love love love Joe!,websterc-55514,n/a,16/08/2025,"He is seriously the best commentator. I loved all of his shows, and I love how he slotted off other detectives work. I'm not sure why the other reviews say the music is too loud, it's never crossed my mind and I've watched every episode several times. I am Joe obsessed ðŸ˜Š",False
13,7,"Good stories, but...",nielsencr,n/a,16/08/2025,Some suspense but the reenactment are poor. They use cars for the police that weren't in production for years after the crimes. CHEAP out for production quality....,False
14,5,Overwhelming background music,rtrainor-34607,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a retired LEO I am a huge fan of crime oriented TV shows. Unfortunately I suffer from a severe hearing impairment and must listen to audio through headphones. The background music and sound is overwhelming, making it next to impossible to follow the narrative of the case detectives and detective Kenda. It's truly unfortunate because I will probably stop watching the show to avoid the frustration of trying to hear and understand the voices.",False
15,10,Great Too See Kenda again,zacharykieler,n/a,16/08/2025,"My friends, my friends Dads and I, all love Kenda. It's so great to see and hear him again. Thank you for bringing him back for more stories. He is absolutely one of a kind. Even though these are somebody else's stories. He's telling it. Which makes the show simply awesome. It's great to hear other detectives stories from around the country. Cases that haunted them and that stuck with them. I had to binge this show after being told about it. Any crime buff will love this show and Kenda. Once you watch one, you will be hooked, and want to watch all Kenda's shows. I have never met anyone who has seen one of his shows that hasn't liked him. The stories are all so engrossing, you can't turn away.",False
16,n/a,LOUD and MORBID music spoils it,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Trying to hear the dialogue over the LOUD music takes the enjoyment out of it. I liked Homicide Hunter, but you could hear Joe. Reminds me of the 'As the stomach turns' sketches in the Carol Burnett show. But this was done as a comedy. Don't know why Am Detective has to ruin its presentation like this.",False
17,8,Can't hear,kieraeric,n/a,16/08/2025,You can't hear them talking the music is louder than the characters please fix.,False
18,10,Background Music,tomcoulson,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe background music is too damned loud. Cut its volume by 2/3 please. So loud it ruins the episode. Can't watch like this. I will continue to review for a time to see if you recognize the issue.,True
19,10,Great show,grannygoosemom,n/a,16/08/2025,I can't praise this show enough. Joe Kenda's comments are always interesting and spot on. Many different people tell the episode story in a factual and easy to understand way. No hidden or obvious agendas. Refreshing! I will watch this show as long as they keep the same great format. I keep deleting my favorite shows so I hope I never have to delete this one. I actually like this show better than Homicide Hunter and I think I have seen all of them. I hope Joe Kenda keeps finding good stories for American Detective. There are a lot of people looking for decent entertainment. We need more shows like this one.,False
20,10,"I was honored to be featured in the series finale based on a story from my book ""Twisted But True Book II - Filling in the Cracks""",darrenburch-19817,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great production and the producer Briana and Homicide Hunter himself, Joe Kenda could not have treated me any better. They are both truly a Class Act.They could not get all the twists and turns from the story in ""Twisted But True Book II - Filling in the Cracks"" as it would have had to been 3X as long. But other than that - great job.",False
21,8,Unnecessary music .,cknocker,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brilliant program but trying to understand the accents with no subtitles and the loud music spoils the atmosphere of the program .Why do they put on this music ?It's like they Dont want people to enjoy it.You would think after all the complaints about the noisey music they would do something about it.Also six hundred characters for a review is a bit much.I am still try to get enough characters on so it will accept my review.By the time my Review is accepted maybe they will have done something about the annoying music on the program .Hope the loud music on the program hasn't damaged my ears, o sounds like computer music,or monkey music.",False
22,6,Disappointing,chaps-one,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a big fan of Homicide Hunter and an even bigger fan of The First 48. When I saw that the first episode featured Detective Joe Schillaci I was immediately excited! He was one of my favorite Detrctives on the original The First 48 seasons.Then I watched further and immediately recognized the case as one featured on The First 48. Why would you cast a Detective from one of the most popular true crime shows ever, only to feature a case everyone that has watched The First 48 already knows.I'd rather go back and watch the case as it actually happened, then have it reenacted by actors.",False
23,7,Please STOP the background music,alanansheila-83641,n/a,16/08/2025,The music is so annoying and distracting. Totally spoils the program. If joe kendal wasn't a favourite I would have turned this off. Why do programmes insist on doing this. I see more complaints of this nature all the time and yet producers continue to do this. It is a struggle to hear what is being said over the background music. I think producers must become immune to it because they have probably heard the narrative so many times and know it verbatim. Please stop spoiling these programs and share this opinion with others in the business. I would also be grateful if others who agree with me would support my comment.,False
24,1,Loud,iretired,n/a,16/08/2025,The background music is loud and annoying. Can barely hear the dialog. Won't be watching.,False
25,1,There is nothing good about this,tangledupinbluetoo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Its cheap, frustratingly slow, no where near homicide hunter quality, full of cliches and tons of misplaced sentimentality. UGH.",False

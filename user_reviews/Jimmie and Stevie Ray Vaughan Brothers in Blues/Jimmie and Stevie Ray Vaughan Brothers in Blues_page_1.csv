1,8,"""For two boys who came from nowhere, they both wound up somewhere.""",classicsoncall,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't know how, but I was never aware of Stevie Ray Vaughan until well after he died in a helicopter crash, chronicled in this documentary by his brother Jimmie. I'm sorry I missed the brothers and their music, though I now look them up on You tube and thrill to their wonderful brand of blues music. This documentary features Jimmie Vaughan talking about growing up in Cliff Oak, Texas and how both he and Stevie picked up guitars at an early age and virtually self-taught themselves to play. In Jimmie's case, it came as a result of a broken collarbone from a high school football injury; his father bought him a fifty dollar guitar which he took to immediately. The early years of teenage bands and moving up in stature via recognition by music industry pros launched the boys, especially Stevie, to the heights of electric guitar success. So successful was Jimmie that he wound up making more money than his dad while still a teenager playing local gigs. Alongside Jimmie are music legends like Eric Clapton, Jackson Browne, Billy Gibbons and producer Nile Rodgers speaking of their fondness for the siblings, and lamenting the passing of a guitar god legend like Stevie, a life cut short at only thirty five. Old time and future fans of the Vaughan Brothers owe it to themselves to take a look at this informative documentary with only one slight downside - there's not enough music to satisfy the average blues fan.",True
2,10,"Andrew Dansby, The Houston Chronicle",kirby-39,n/a,15/08/2025,"Documentaries often are made by a curious outsider looking in on a subject. Kirby F. Warnock - writer and director of ""Brothers in Blues: Jimmie and Stevie Ray Vaughan"" - grew up in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas with the guitar-playing brothers, giving him a refreshing perspective from the inside looking out.Warnock secured some high-profile talking heads for his film: Eric Clapton, Billy Gibbons, Nile Rodgers, Jackson Browne. But in ""Brothers in Blues,"" these Rock & Roll Hall of Famers receive no preferential treatment over Dallas-area players like Johnny Peebles, Tommy Carter and Jimmy Wallace, who traveled closely in space and time with the two Vaughan siblings.The result is a film refreshing for its centeredness. Warnock wrote, produced, directed and narrated ""Brothers in Blues,"" which screens at the Heights Theater on March 26 and can be rented through Vudu. His narration, in particular, lends it a warmth and familiarity. Rather than the Voice of God-style commentary prevalent in documentary filmmaking, Warnock imbues ""Brothers in Blues"" with the vibe of an impromptu story told by a natural raconteur. His approach is informal, with little disarming editorial comments that create an effect both personal and charming.",False
3,10,*Feel-Good Blues!*,beautytruthlovefreedom,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the story of how Stevie and Jimmie Vaughan's musical journey began, and how it unfolded, interwoven with how life was for kids growing up in the '50s and '60s as they did. Great memories from Billy Gibbons and several other mainstays of the early Texas rock and blues scene. Priceless early snapshots and music clips. Everyone should enjoy this movie!Listening to Kirby Warnock narrating this will give you a sense of the warmth and close-knit feeling of growing up in Texas. Mentioning the places the boys played while very young and as they began to achieve fame brings Texas to life. If you loved them from the beginning, it will respark that joy. If you are new to the Vaughan Brothers, get ready for a journey. Either way, you will always be glad you hopped onboard the Vaughan Brothers blues train.The Vaughan Brothers got me through a rough decade with their feel-good blues. Thank you, boys. I'm forever grateful!",False
4,10,Incredible!,trusttheuniverse,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you love music documentaries then check this one out. It's a wonderful story about the brothers and has great interviews. You'll get to hear from Jimmie Vaughan himself, and you'll discover a lot of things you might not have known.It talks a lot about the brothers being in competition with each other, and how practice really does make perfect. It talks about practicing acoustic guitar alone by yourself to develop hand strength. It has the ups and downs of Stevie's addictions.It paints a great picture of how Jimmie and Stevie came to be legends in guitar playing, and how if you try hard enough anything is possible.10/10.",True
5,9,Brothers in Blues,clay-71568,n/a,15/08/2025,I just finished watching Brothers in Blues and really enjoyed this documentary! I thought the history about Oak Cliff and Dallas really helped to frame how the Vaughan's got into music and what it was like to grow up in that area and time.It is amazing to see how many people. Came from that area that influenced film and music. The story of the Vaughan's is an amazing and Kirby tells in a way that makes you feel you were there each step of the way. The artist he was able to secure for interviews really help to bring further clarity to the whole story. Who knew you could pay for recording sessions with horses! LolReally enjoyed it and highly recommend it! Well done and thank you to all involved!! Thank you Kirby!!!,False
6,3,Too much talking for a music documentary,bubba_shubba,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you've never experienced Stevie Ray Vaughan's music and fiery playing before - well after watching this documentary you still won't have. Go look him up on YouTube I guess.For a documentary about musicians, there's so little footage or music of the players themselves (not to mention their influences) that it's almost criminal. Kirby Warnock will talk and bore your ears off, you'll hear the odd out-of-context snippet of music if you listen carefully, but you'll find yourself halfway through the documentary wondering if they will ever show a clip of the things they are describing (sorry to say - they won't.)For an SRV documentary there are also some conspicuous absences - Tommy Shannon? Nope. Chris Layton? Nope. Not even Reese Wynans! Sure there's a bit of Jackson Browne, a bit of Clapton, a bit of Billy Gibbons - but overall this just feels like a very flat attempt at reminding the world Jimmie Vaughan is still here and plays the guitar.",False

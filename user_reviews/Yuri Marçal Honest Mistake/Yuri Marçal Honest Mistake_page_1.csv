1,8,One of the best Brazilian comedians,ella_kelbert,n/a,16/08/2025,"(The low rate comes probably from WASPs.)The show is brilliant, Yuri has a modern and intelligent sense of humor. He talks about his life, his family and his childhood in a low class neighborhood in Brazil. He also talks about religion (""Why was Jesus probably black?"") and racism in a smart and funny way. He deserves more Netflix specials like that.I highly recommend!",False

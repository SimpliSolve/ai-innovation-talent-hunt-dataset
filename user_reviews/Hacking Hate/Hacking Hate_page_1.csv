1,10,Thought provoking documentary,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis incredible documentary drama was indeed a gem, and one of the more anticipated films of the year.It delves into internet hate and trolling and exposes the dangers and truths behind it in shocking ways, and is indeed an eye opening endevaour into taking the web with a grain of salt.As a documentary feature, it is incredibly well cut and informative, incredible cinematography and editing. Delving into both the markets and businesses of hate in Sweden as well as abroad, its consequences and its audience, and doing so in a fullfilling fashion.Overall, a very accurate and poignant feature, that will leave you encouraged to stay offline as much as possible, I would say. Atleast avoiding certain outlets.",True
2,10,Comments and Ratings reflects the strenght of this film.,luciengarin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hate found it ways into the reviews and ratings which proves the importance of this documentary!Please read the official reviews and watch this film, it should be shown in schools and all teachers should watch it.This world is controlled by the most powerful and rich, one cannot argue against this fact, just look at the team criminal Trump is working with, they do not care about the poor - All they want is to divide and promote hate, they are the real threat to democracy!To fight for proper journalism and human rights will forever be a fight against the corporations controlling this planet, the elite wants people to be pacified and less educated so they are easier to control. So that people have an easier way to find a common enemy to a complex problem these corporations have a huge part of creating!The same people who follow those that profit of Hate and urges to divide us are posting the cheapest reviews here with no relevance or proper in debt critique which just proves the importance of this amazing film! Just look at their profile names... nyalcodes24926 patrks3294.",False
3,10,Extreamly important film,meantimejanos-82944,n/a,16/08/2025,This should certainly be shown in every school in any country where there is an ongoing struggle for democracy.And democracy is a very fine word and there is probably no country who can say they are havin a 100% democracy.But this movie explains most of the ongoing manipulations which struggle to destroy democracy worldwide.And to what extent the social medias make this manipulations possible. And how profitable this hate and confusion in social medias really is.I cannot see how this movie is telling any lies in these matters.And the negative reviews given about this documentary shows how serious this problem has become.People must watch this.,False
4,10,1/10 ratings are from review bombers,silvereke,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is an amazing ride and jump into the rabbit hole of far right extremism, how it spreads and from where it stems from. It also points out how social media corporations benefits from online hate and therefore has started to suppress it less. The online world is an increasingly dangerous and hostile environment. This can be seen by all the 1/10 ratings that this movie quickly got after right-wing influences started pointing at it. This film does a great job in point us into different directions and perspectives by the help of the great journalist we follow.Stop hating and start questioning ðŸ¤˜",False
5,n/a,Spiteful outcasts projecting their resentment onto others.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary makers are a bizarre group of people. They seem to conflate opposition to mass immigration, or any concerns at all about it, as being ""hate"".In Sweden like in many places across Europe, such antiquated viewpoints are being made obsolete by the overwhelming swell of public feeling that has grown resentful over the media's ignoring of the negative side effects of forcing people from wildldy different cultures to live along side one another.What is worse is the ""journalists"" attempt to spy on the children of the man they were trying to tarnish the character of.It gave the impression of very resentful and envious people trying to undermine what they see as the healthy and normal people out of bitterness.This kind of hate-filled hack journalism belongs to be left in 2016.",False
6,1,Not it!,bortrom,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe contemporary equivalent to the witch hunts of the seventeenth century, and the satanic panic of the last century. Very dull and uninteresting film that seeks to misrepresent specific individuals whilst using less than ethical methods in doing so (harassment, stalking, etc.) The director and the presenters will do anything they can to 'hack' the narrative, pushing their own motives and opinions in less than subtle ways. Branding non-deserving people as neo-nazi's is 'not it', and should be met with scorn and distrust directed at those behind the production of this movie.In fact, I suggest that any party interested in watching this documentary do their research on the hateful posts circulating that have been published by the presenter, and face of the documentary.",True
7,10,Fascinating doc about the relationship between tech and journalism,hussaincurrimbhoy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved this doc, have followed Simon's films for many years and have enjoyed his inquiries into society and humanity. This is essential viewing. I learned so much. I see how the extremists get their way online, and how it is rewarded. Applies to Sweden and many western nations being over run by the far right, the small minded, the gullible. This doc needs to be seen by everyone who cares about the strength of journalism in the West, but how it can be manipulated by big tech all for the sake of profit. Luckily the film is in cinemas, and should be experienced there I think. Check it out and spread the word!",False
8,10,Right wing snowflakes are sabotaging the reviews,jazztity,n/a,16/08/2025,"IMPORTANT: The majority of ratings are from people who haven't even seen the movie, they were just sent here like the stupid puppets they are by some of the right wing influencers portrayed in the movie.As someone who actually HAS seen it I would say it's one of the most important films you will see this year. In fact I think you NEED to watch it if you're a person on the internet, especially with the current state of affairs in the world. Who needs thrillers and horror movies these days when we have documentaries.The journalist My Vingren has been referred to as the ""real"" Girl with the dragon tattoo, but I think she is much more than that, she is a well respected journalist putting a lot on the line to be able to show us these far right online movements from within. The director does a really good job of keeping a movie with a storyline that is almost entirely set online, visually interesting and cinema worthy.Watch it!",False
9,8,Insightful,danielstalbalk,n/a,16/08/2025,"It came to my understanding after watching this amazing documentary, how hatred combined with miss information can and in fact will spread False propaganda. This documentary shows how hatred through social media can be spread throughout the world with a blink of an eye. How political leaders uses the ""free media"" to spread out fear and promote hate.Moreover, if you are looking for a documentary that shows a bit on ""what's going on behind the scenes"" then this is a must see.In the world we live in these days, this documentary Will for sure be very relevant.Great movie and great investigation.",False
10,1,They tried to find photos of little kids for malicious means,stepanibanderi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Marcus Follin made a youtube video regarding this movie since it has tried to besmirch his name. In the video he shows proof of how these people made fake instagram accounts in order to aquire private pictures reserved for friends and family on a private instagram account. They quite obviously wished to aquire these pictures for sinister and hatefull reasons, but what exactly these reasons are I am unsure. Whatever the reasoning, it is abhorrent to involve little kids AS WELL AS pictures/videos of said kids in this.Beyond this, statements made by one woman who worked on this by the name of My Vingren has made extremely racist remarks against europeans in the past. A quote by Vingren follows ""Alla vita Ã¤r fula"" which translated to english means ""All whites (white skinned europeans) are ugly"".Later in the same twitter post of hers she also writes that being white skinned is a ""disease"" and that all who has white skinned ought to be ""classed"" as such.",False
11,10,Say no to Racism,jorgecbjj,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really liked the way our daily reality was transmitted, in short a message for the world, a modern world full of limitations and racial prejudices. Congratulations on the seriousness of this magnificent work. No one is born hating another person because of the color of their skin, their origin or even their religion. To hate, people must learn, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love. We will never, ever bow down to racism and intolerance, whatever it may be. We will not give in an inch to hatred. Explicit bad behavior in acts of racism demonstrates an alleged false superiority. Some citizens believe they have the right to insult others because of the color of their skin. As if they don't realize the moral rot in which they are immersed.",True
12,1,Disgusting,mickflahertyart,n/a,16/08/2025,"Targeting children in an attempt to silence regular peoples concern of the impact of the film makers own insane ideology.Hopefully 2025 is when we may finally see some sense returning to the western world, and that this kind of toxic ideological bombardment and its accompanying sadistic and downright evil methods of enforcing its will upon the populations of the west is finally over.As ever with these types, everything is a projection. The hatred these types have for anyone who does not align with there self destructive cult like mentality is absolutely unparalleled.Amazingly, their ego always assumes they're forever in the right, so they brazenly document their own diabolic actions.May this be a lesson in human decency to the film makers.",False
13,9,On point,gorbatova-06627,n/a,16/08/2025,"Honestly, if you hate on this film, you're likely a part of the problem. It was relevant, engaging and critically necessary. The journalist depicted in it is an inspiration to anyone wanting to do journalism or open source intelligence. At times, she even compromises her safety but be sure she knows what she's doing.",False
14,1,Extremists describe other extremists,mga-99516,n/a,16/08/2025,I didn't know about any of the people depicted in the movie and was drawn into the engagement of My (et al).However after reading her texts and about her fanatical Antifa / AFA engagement it's hard to think of this movie as nothing but a way to make one side look good.The researchers should have spent more time in finding the right person to depict the fight against extremismnot let one extremist describe another.It's sad that this movie wasn't more nuanced as this is an important topic that really needs more discussion.Personally I don't think this movie will do the world good in the short term. As it makes extremists look good.,False

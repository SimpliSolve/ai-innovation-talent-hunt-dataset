1,1,No Awards for Sound Mixing,marcatucker,n/a,15/08/2025,Whoever did the sound mixing needs their hearing checked. For the first 15 minutes the background music often overplayed the dialogue and you couldn't tell what was being said. Even going back and using subtitles you have to really concentrate on what's being said. Please do your production company a favor and don't rehire your editor or sound department for any further projects. Thank goodness for imdb so I can look up the other projects these people have done and potentially stay away from them. That's a lot of work on a year. It should be quality over quantity however. Please keep that in mind with future projects.,False
2,1,Don't even bother with this crap,Codes_84,n/a,15/08/2025,"In all honesty, how can you take this documentary seriously when they (the idiot documentary producers) can't even get the release dates of his movies correct.I promptly turned this off after about ten minutes to watch something with some actual accuracy.Also they tended to paint Harrison Ford in a somewhat negative light (from what I could tell in ten minutes). Fair enough he's been honest about the roles he's taken and said that he's liked and disliked certain characters he's played which is fair enough. Not all actors are proud of their work or roles they've played. At least he's been honest about it.",False
3,1,You could learn more just by reading Wikipedia,dbcongalton,n/a,15/08/2025,"This ""documentary"" is a total waste of time. Completely. All the producers did was throw together a pile of clips from over the years about Ford. There is no original research or interviews conducted. You can learn just as much by reading his Wikipedia entry.However, most jarring of all is the NONSTOP MUSIC throughout this movie. WTF???? It's LOUD and ANNOYING and DISTRACTING. They even play the music DURING the movie clips.So The Powers That Be are now telling me that my review is too short, so I have to keep typing and coming up with reasons why you shouldn't waste your time with this faux-documentary.",False

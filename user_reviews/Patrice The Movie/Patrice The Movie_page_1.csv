1,9,"Amazing & so, so important to watch",jibbyjibson,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not someone who typically watches documentaries but this one was incredible. Patrice and her partner Gary are both amazing people, especially Patrice who's shown to be so hardworking and have such neat, creative hobbies through dealing with so many struggles in her life. She's such a strong advocate for the disabled community and never backs down. The unfairness in law for disabled folks is told about in this movie and it's SO important that people learn about it. I hope viewers understand that we need change, that advocating for the disabled community is so important. I'm so glad this was all brought up and that Patrice is someone who keeps going, keeps fighting through what she's been through and continues to deal with.Watch it. It's worth it.",False
2,10,Absolutely Necessary!,rachelraeware,n/a,16/08/2025,"Man oh man this is a must watch. Informative, entertaining, endearing, and whirlwind of emotions. I loved watching Patrice & Gary, both have a fantastic sense of humor! What I don't love is the information revealed about how the government financially handicaps disabled persons. They can lose benefits for anything! The government makes it a lose-lose situation for them to get their basic needs met. I hope many people watch this documentary to learn about Medicaid and more importantly push for reform. There are significant changes needed to better support the differently abled community and these changes need to happen yesterday!",False
3,10,Oh. My. Goodness.,ChristyGuinn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well this documentary will have you all up in your feelings. It is so sweet and very eye opening. I am ashamed to say there are laws that I had no idea about. As someone who has worked since 15, paid taxes and struggled many times in my life, I've been pissed more than once about what my hard earned tax dollars go to. As a single mom to an almost 20 year old there were times when I wasn't sure we'd make it. I have ZERO doubt about the lazy, entitled, non working, able bodied young people who suck off the taxpayers with no regard to how hard we have to work. They do it for decades, then teach their kids how to scam the system. They are everywhere and they get the lions share. Not our veterans, not our disabled not our needy, it's the greedy and it's disgusting. Things have got to change or everyone, like me, will say F it one day and just quit working or quit paying taxes. Hell I couldn't get a DIME while being single, working as a hairstylist (don't work don't get paid) and going through chemo TWICE in the past 8 years. The system is so broken and so unfairly stupid at times. This documentary is an eye opener and it's so very sweet. I'll say this, Patrice is quite a woman with the love of some very good people. She is smart, talented and extremely artistic. Thank you for this. I needed this in my life. All the people we protect with our laws and these people, who are in very real need are left behind. Do better politicians. Be better humans. Learn better how to spend OUR money fairly.",False
4,10,Beautiful and Important,patriciatarquinio,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a genuinely beautiful and important movie. The characters are real and come across authenticity on screen. It is funny, informative and touching. It is wonderfully edited and the presentation of the story helps to tell this profound story in a lighthearted and entertaining fashion. It's a must see!People with disabilities are often overlooked or discounted. When you see the power of the determination in this group of passionate and dedicated individuals, you cannot help but be inspired to do mor in your own life as well as to help champion their cause.I look forward to sequels since it is a story I want to follow!",False

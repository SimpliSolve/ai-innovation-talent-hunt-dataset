4,2,Simple explanation and limited release of information,Xavier_Stone,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAs I watch the 2nd episode it seems like they are with holding quite a bit of information. Whether this is to keep procedures and intelligence from prying eyes or just the doc makers keeping it simple.Nothing is really interesting and it paints the FBI as huge heroes who can't do anything wrong. So basically propaganda and a recruiting tool. Not much of any sort of stories.The follow 10 Russian spies for years, decades they say, and they catch them with....? a laptop and doing 2 dead drops that they were paid to do. So basically next to zero evidence that they show us. Since they have nothing on them they do a spy swap, 10 for 4 US ones. Wow. Great work guys, what a success, they admit that nothing was taken, nothing stolen. GTFO.",True

1,10,The most honest bicycle adventure movie out there,danndecl,n/a,16/08/2025,"This feels like adventure as it is truly lived. It's touching because it feels real, warts and all - so I believe in it. Because of Andis and Dominiks unpretentious candour, I gladly followed them through the endless head-winds, the relentless heat and all the annoying flies; happy, that I myself wasn't in that situation.
If I may quote Paul Theroux: ""Travel is glamorous only in retrospect.""",False

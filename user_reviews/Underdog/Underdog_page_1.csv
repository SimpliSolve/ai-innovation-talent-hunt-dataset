2,10,"Vérité film capturing the complexities, joys, and struggles of Doug Butler's life",marnepike,n/a,16/08/2025,"Underdog is a heartwarming, heart-wrenching, hopeful, and hilarious vérité film. It shares Doug Butler's rollercoaster of a journey on his farm in Vermont and finding his way to Alaska. I found myself with tears in my eyes one moment, and then cackling alongside Doug the next.The filmmaker beautifully captured the passage of time, and vulnerable moments with Doug, someone who clearly doesn't open up too often. Those glimpses into the hardships of Doug's life added a layer of complexity that make the high-points that much higher, and left me cheering Doug along at every turn.Loved this film.",False

The low budget documentary is heartfelt, heartbreaking and heart melting all at once. This independent film shows the daily struggles of farming and how truly hard it is to keep a farm alive in this modern economy; the audience experiences birth, the sad death of farm animals, and the joy of the palpable love between Butler and his dogs. I will forever hold the images of Doug kissing his dogs, and them loving him back. His exuberance for life is infectious and spills over the hardships he faces daily.",False
4,10,"The Textures, Sights and Sounds of Rural Vermont",annaparitsky,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film elegantly captures the textures, sights and sounds of rural Vermont, from the pineappleweed in the driveway to the woodcock's song beckoning spring, and the omnipresence of manure. It was powerful and surreal to see home on the big screen, and left me feeling immense gratitude for life's little details. Doug's fiercely jovial and dedicated personality was on full display, his character ringing true to the man himself. His love for land and animal is a theme throughout. By the end of the film you will want to be Doug's friend, his biggest fan, and most certainly his sled racing partner.",False
5,10,Review for Underdog - A Real Story about A Real Man,mahoosucguides,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed seeing this movie. It is about real life, real passion, life of a dairy farmer, life of a sprint dog sled driver, a man fulfilling his dream, something many people think about but do not do. The director obviously has a great sense of ""down to earthiness"" which is so needed on the film these days.I have a cousin who is a cow farmer, some friends who are cow farmers so I know the dedication it takes to own a farm like this. The work is never ending.I am a dog musher and often say we are like cow farmers in that it is very difficult to ever leave the farm. Well this film gives you an idea of what this lifestyle is like and to see a man fulfilling his dreams even among real life challenges.",False
6,10,An emotional joyful captivating film,michelletonyfoster,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFrom the beginning you know the film is capturing the realities of Butler's life as a dairy farmer in Vermont. But what grabs the audience is how the filmmakers are able to tell a compassionate story, one in which you will feel all the emotions that Butler feels.In the film you will see the contrast of the of a dairy farmer and his passion for dog sledding.The cinematography is exceptional both when it portrays nature and man and his dogs. By pausing action with serene scenes of nature: leaves blowing in the wind, a flock of birds landing in a tree or snow gently falling the audience has time to absorb the changing seasons and temperatures both metaphorically and physically. Personally, I was enthralled by one scene. It concentrated in slow motion on a dog running directly toward the screen- his eyes, his tongue, his legs, in slow motion. The scene also served as a preface to coming dog sled adventure.The soundtrack blended well with the imagery and the story. At times I wished I could concentrate just on the music and sounds of nature.This film is a work of profound art in so many ways. I highly recommend seeing it. Congratulations to the film's collaborators, Tommy Hyde.and Aaron Wolfe for making this documentary about a man filled with joy and heartache...an underdog.",True
7,10,"You don't know Doug Butler, but you'll wish you did after watching",RPage6943,n/a,16/08/2025,"Doug Butler is a force of nature with a good heart and an indefatigable positive attitude. ""Underdog"" follows Doug on his long path attempting to make it to a dog sledding race in Alaska as he faces the daily challenges of running a family farm in Vermont, without any sugar coating.You'll learn as much about the rigors of running a small family farm as you will about developing a dog sled team - on a shoestring budget.Doug seems to be constantly in motion, so much so that I doubt that Tommy Hyde, who made the film, could keep up with him or get him to sit down long enough to talk about his situation, which works to our advantage, I think, as we see Doug being Doug which tells us what we need to know.Very interesting and heart warming with a sharp edge of reality. Well worth watching.",False

9,10,Captivating,lauraleh,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOutstanding film. Authentic story of a man with a big personality who had prior never left the family farm for more than five days. Doug Butler committed to chasing a dream and race his dogs in Alaska. Emotional. Funny. Poignant. Well crafted. The film shares the beauty and challenges of farming. It also accurately touches on the decisions and emotions wrapped up in the survival of family farms. But most of all, it's getting to know Doug Butler and the glint in his eye, his expressions, his performative moments and his more reflective placid ones. I laughed, cried, and wondered how many 60+ year olds have a thirst for Mike's Hard Lemonade and how long it took Doug to perfect grabbing a beer from a moving sled like a champion marathoner grabbing a Gatorade paper cup. He is an adventure.",True
10,10,True depiction of the highs and lows of an exceptional being,anabellatidonaboldini,n/a,16/08/2025,"You will find yourself immersed in Doug's life. His dairy farm and all the struggles of running a family business, his passion for dog racing, the seasons changing in Middlebury, Vermont.It chronicles his struggles, but also his joys. You will be rooting for Doug in no time.It is a window into rural America, the plights of small farms, and dogsled racing.I enjoyed this film very much, it was, as another reviewer said it, ""heartwarming and heart-wrenching"" but definitely worth seeing.Another important theme that comes up in the film is the higher suicide rate among farmers. I believe this film is relevant both for city dwellers and people that live in rural areas. The film maker and the subject of this documentary hope to help bring this film to rural places to start a conversation around this pressing topic.Go see this film, it's the sweetest, most authentic movie I've seen so far this year.",False
11,10,Bravo! A film that will stand with the great verite documentaries. Watch it today!,colin-667,n/a,16/08/2025,"Doug Butler is captured in all his energy, humor, optimism and grace in the face of daunting challenges. Butler's comfort with the director allowed us astonishing access to the highs and lows of a dairy farmer's precarious existence. Like the best documentaries, the film often feels like a scripted narrative - a testament to the 300 hours of filming time and the filmmakers' skillful storytelling and editing.Most importantly, Doug's story couldn't arrive at a better time in American life - we all could use some of his relentlessly big heart and good cheer. Share this film with others - it will stick with every person who watches.",False
12,10,An ultimately joyful story,arthurselkowitz,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerUnderdog is a marvelous, uplifting experience. Although it depicts the very hard life of a small New England farmer, he is so upbeat and full of life that he brings you joy. And when achieves his lifetime goal, we all rejoiced with him. We get to know what life on a farm is by seeing our farmer go through all the travails of working a sinking farm operation. What saves him is his passion for dog sledding and his quest to compete in the Alaskan Iditarod. The photography is impressive. You feel the cold, the mud, the joy of the birth of a calf and the poignancy of having to put down a cow. This documentary is well worth seeing.",True
13,10,See this film! You won't forget it!,johnwyman-89808,n/a,16/08/2025,"Highly highly recommend!!! Very thoughtfully made film that gripped my attention and my heart from start to finish. Doug is a mesmerizing character and you can't help but cheer him on. Plenty of micro and macro themes to chew on after the credits roll too, so it makes for a good post-movie conversation. There's the inspiring storyline of Doug's indomitable optimism and sportsmanship. There's also a sober portrayal of the predicaments facing family farmers in Vermont and elsewhere in the U. S. Hyde doesn't shy away from these themes, but wisely let's the film do the talking so you can reach your own conclusions. I look forward to more stuff from Hyde! And best wishes to Doug, if you happen to read this!",False

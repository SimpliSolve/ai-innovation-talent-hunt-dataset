1,10,...... Wash it down with gasoline. Dry it with a match,iamverbalkentiam,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Ike Reilly Assassination is equal parts punch in the face rock n roll, and a wet, sloppy kiss on the mouth involving entirely too much tongue, and unexpected. Perhaps unwanted.The band is tight. Cruise ship hot tub tight. They fit together like 32 sun bathers in a spa that accommodates 8.Don't Turn Your Back On Friday Night expertly captures the madness that is the fact.....this band regularly plays in front of nobody.They're the best gawdam rock n roll band, and the best gawdam kept secret.Some part of me will regret if they break through with well deserved commercial success. But I love my brother Ike too much to see it withheld from him.Ike is Christ and Judas, with Pontius Pilate washing his hands in a convenient basin, standing nearby watching the betrayal. He's Jack Sparrow, and the admiral of his own frothing, seven poetic seas.Nostradamus, and Sling Blade.Underestimate this man, and this band, at your own peril. As for me, I'll follow him into a burning house to rescue his guitar.Get some money Ike, and some glory too.",False
2,10,The most authentic songwriter you're likely to find,drjbmatthews,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an outstanding film! If, like me, you are already an Ike fan, you will love the behind-the-scenes peek into his life, family, and friends. Amazing footage. If this is the first you are learning about him, you are in for a treat. He is one of the most authentic and compelling songwriters and performers you're ever likely to encounter. Ike's music is hard to capture in a neat description (part, perhaps, of why he isn't more widely known and appreciated). I think the best description I've heard is what Bob Dylan would have sounded like if his inspiration came from Joe Strummer rather than Woody Guthrie.",False
3,10,"Raw,real,amazing",hvyhmksk,n/a,16/08/2025,"A story about an amazingly talented singer and song writer, band , and family. The music is great. The story is even better. Ike is such a poet. The ups and downs of the music industry, raising a family while in that business, touring, friendships - it is all there. When you watch this you will wonder why Ike isn't one of the biggest names out there in the industry. His music is poetry set to an amazing rock and roll story line. The love of his hometown and family is strong. His many friends and supporters also show up for him. The only thing that is missing is a soundtrack to go along with the movie.",False
4,10,Feel good rock doc will leave you wanting more,tallbeers,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love how this film captures the authenticity of an unsung music hero, Ike Reilly. Don't Turn Your Back on Friday Night is an intimate portrait of Ike's life with his band, and his family; his impact on music should be not be overlooked, even though the wider world has yet to fully embrace him, they should. Exploring the life and backstories of what's behind his music is a fascinating way to tell this story. The story so relatable on so many front, it's funny, poignant and touching. Watch the film, listen to his music, see him live; you will not be disappointed. He'll leave you wanting more and more, guaranteed.",False
5,10,A rockin' fabulous documentary about a musical genius!,rbj-57581,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a fabulous documentary about one of the greatest musicians and songwriters the world has been given! Learning the history of many songs, along with the life experiences leading to many of them is a special treat. The Reilly family is very kind to share a glimpse into their lives. I'm amazed by the variety of songs created and topics covered, many of which have a statement to ponder. If you're familiar with the Ike Reilly Assassination band, you will love seeing and hearing from many members who share their experiences, along with great music. If you're not familiar with the band or Ike Reilly, you just might become a new fan!",False
6,10,Great story about a truly gifted musician.,jimminder,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have followed Ike all the back to his early times at the Entry. I can sing nearly every song he has recorded as can many of his fans. His lyrics are moving yet troubling to me. Is he an angel or a .....? He is a genius. I have asked his song ""Farewell to the Good Times "" be played at my ""good by"" party. The movie has done a good job of capturing his pleasure and pain and the struggle that his been his life. Ike, you have a devoted fan base like no other but I like the movie question why the world doesn't see it. Ike, you are one of the most gifted artist of our time. With you friend. Great movie.",False
7,10,Watch this film!!!!!!,bethaszymanski-31629,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a fan of Ike Reilly and The IRA for a long time, and ""Don't Turn Your Back on Friday Night"" was such a great watch! It really shows off his music and personality. My brother's families and mine have enjoyed his songs and concerts for years, and this documentary gave us a cool look behind the scenes.The live performances were wonderful, and it was fun to see more of Ike's story. The documentary does a great job of capturing the energy and passion that Ike brings to his music. Also hearing about his families struggles and triumphs make you appreciate his work even more.One of the best parts was seeing the candid moments and hearing stories that we hadn't heard before. It felt like we were getting an inside look at what makes Ike's music so special. Watch this film! If you weren't a fan before you will definitely be leavin as a fan!! ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¤ ðŸ’¯",False
8,10,The best American musician you haven't heard of,willfair-93667,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story of an independent musician told by his lifelong friends and famous fans. Executive produced by Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine) Ike Reilly is an artist who walks in the footsteps of Woody Guthrie and Joe Strummer. Lots of people have been inspired by Bob Dylan, but instead of music just being a phase of his youth, he actually picked up his guitar and started writing songs. Then he put together a crack band and went on the road. Rock critics frequently write about artists that ""march to their own drummer"" or have an ""uncompromising musical vision"" but most of those artists couldn't hold a candle to Ike Reilly. Check it out!",False
9,10,"An inspiring ""underdog"" story",delaneykkatz,n/a,16/08/2025,"A film that reminds you of the pockets of brilliance hidden in every corner of the world, and the beauty of life even when it's sung in a different key. As a fellow Lake County suburbanite, learning about Ike reminds me to make meaning of my surroundings, and to costume your life in a way that no matter where you are, you can still be a rockstar. I'm stunned by the fact that there was such artistic brilliance taking place only 30 minutes away from me! It makes me think of all of the great things that are constantly happening, and what an honor it is to live inside someone else's world for a moment. Life is not a linear story, and there are so many ways to measure what it means to be ""successful"", and this film reminds us of that oft forgotten fact so brilliantly. Not only that, but it is so well structured in narrative, using quintessential songs from his catalogue as markers for big chapters in his life. It's honest yet sincere, like all great documentaries should be. I feel like I left with such a well rounded understanding of who Ike is, and he's never even interviewed in the movie! I'm so glad I got to see a premiere of this and see him perform right after. I'll never forget it.",False
10,10,Well done,carolynr-28049,n/a,16/08/2025,Well done film about a rock star that never truly got discovered. I didn't really know who he was but after watching it I'm happy to call myself a fan. I especially liked how the songs were explained with old clips and current. He is such a family man that now has his sons sing with him. His songs are so real which you don't see a lot these days. I also loved the guest appearances of old friends. We were blessed to have him play live after the film and that was the best way to top off the night. I definitely plan on watching this again and spreading the word to family and friends. Keep on rocking it Ike!,False

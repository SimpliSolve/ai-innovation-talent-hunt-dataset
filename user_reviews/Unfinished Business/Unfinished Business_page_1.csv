1,10,Loved it! If you love basketball üèÄ see this film!,tate-nova,n/a,15/08/2025,What an incredible film that outlines the history but also where we are currently with the team. What a fantastic opportunity to meet the players and the fans! Such an intimate portrait too. I really loved the way the film demonstrated the significance of LGBTQ fans and players and how that's always been part of the wnba. Also to see Joan Jett speak about the liberty! I love it. Couldn't have come out at a better time with the season just starting. I'm a huge liberty fan and love the games - home opener was packed! Can't wait for the rest of the season!!! Such a diverse exciting place and an awesome film. Get hyped for this season theres unfinished business indeed. Also side note - the cinematography is not to be missed. Honestly beyond basketball if you such want a great story check this out.,False
2,1,Where are all the Feminists? Where are the Women?,jackkern-862-993699,n/a,15/08/2025,"The main reason why WNBA players make less money than NBA players is because the league simply generates less revenue. Why? No one's going to the games! It's a Women's league, where are all the so-called feminists who fought so hard to have a WNBA? Where are the Women who should be supporting the WNBA? Watching Real Housewives instead perhaps? Not that there is anything wrong with that but ask yourselves did you even Really want a WNBA? Or was it just an empty expression of some convoluted empty feminist platitude that gave birth to the WNBA that has failed to pack a house for decades?If you Don't sell tickets it costs the promoters Big $money, they are Not in the business of Losing Money!",False
3,n/a,Joan Jett and Teresa Witherspoon - you are the league!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm not sure what to rate this, because it's not really my thing. I don't really get the point of passion for sports which is essentially a game. I understand the enjoyment of the moment, I understand enjoying playing the sport. But to take it as seriously as they do, that's the part I don't understand. But I guess it's like anything else we love, it defies explanation.Anyway, because I really don't understand it, I feel like I can't give it a fair rating. But, as far as documentaries go, this is made well.I watched this for my baby, Joan Jett. And she's just adorable in it! She's only in two parts of the documentary, but it's worth it for her. It's also worth it to see one of the legacy players, Teresa Witherspoon, talking about how Joan Jett is her baby too! The enthusiasm and Love with which 'Spoon' spoke about Joan was so cute and sweet! I guess I don't mind sharing Joanie with Teresa ha ha!Joan just has that effect on people, because she's just so unbridled, so pure. I don't exactly agree with the voodoo doll though lol! But it was gifted to her, so, what she gonna do? If you were in a tough spot, you would want somebody like Joanie on your side. And I appreciate how Teresa Witherspoon appreciated her. She too, was adorable!Any true friend of Joan's, is a friend of mine. I was teary eyed by the end. Let's go, Liberty!",False

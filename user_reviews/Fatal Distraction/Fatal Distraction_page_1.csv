1,8,Heart breaking,hazangel-89910,n/a,17/08/2025,"I remember a similar story like this (unfortunately there are too many) on Oprah years ago. I will never forget the mother saying a technique that can be used is to take off your shoes while you are driving and put them in the back seat. I thought that was a very good idea. I see Sunny Hostin just said this in this documentary. I'm sure she heard it on the Oprah show as well many years agoThis story is horrific. I am still watching but I did not get the feeling this was done on purpose (this is my initial reaction). Please have a box of kleenex handy.Leeana Harris is an extremely strong and intelligent woman. It's amazing that she was able to keep herself together (outwardly). Other people may not have handled the whole thing so well.Just as an aside regarding the story with the Nurse (I think her name is Nicole Engler), I found this case interesting because she stated her daughter was being treated with a UTI. Do children that young suffer from urine infections?I do not believe Ross purposefully harmed his little boy. I hope he eventually gets set free and can get on with his life.",False
2,10,i'm sorry that...,ops-52535,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerIm the first to review this on imdb, this is really a film that everyone growing up ,and especially dreams about having a car and having children to put them in whatever reason you have... just dont forget your child, or pet, or both in the bacseat of your car, their crashproof in their seat but definately not solar radiation/heat proof, and the ultimate judgement of your automatized brainwill fall upon you the day you forgot yours while going to work or cheating or whatever...shall they be convicted as murderers??? I think tomyself that the benefit of the doupt should delve humungously in these types of ''accidents'', after realising that more than 2000 fatal ...accidents of this kind has happened in the u.s. Alone... ive got 3 sons myself, and i never had the chance to forget to let them kids out, cause they where of the hyperactive kind that never stopped being verbal, ... ever!!!So to those who have made this unforgiveable mistake, i forgive 99 percent of you on the benefit of the doupt, and suppose that the punishment of the pure agony and heartache loosing a child is shall be thy sentencing. Do spread the importance of pure attendency always, use your phone alarm, clockalarm or a message service that wakes you up whenever you unforgetfully/unconciously leaves your small ones behind in the car at the most beautiful sunshining day this year.Do it a 2nd time then youre done...a superb documentary about an automotive epidemic disease. RIP to all the victims, youll never be forgotten, and neither will you the closest one.a strong recommendation to view from the grumpy old man.",True

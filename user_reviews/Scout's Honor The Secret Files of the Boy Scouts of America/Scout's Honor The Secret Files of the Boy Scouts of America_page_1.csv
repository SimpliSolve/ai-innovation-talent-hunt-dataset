1,8,"A powerful drama, but genuinely stomach turning.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,17/08/2025,"A powerful ninety minute documentary detailing the systemic abuse and subsequent cover ups that went on for decades inside the scouts.I watched this from the point of view of being a boy scout many years back, a time for me which was one of learning, socialising and fun, you can only imagine the horrors faced by these men.Some incredibly powerful testimonies from victims, and input from those that were involved in The Scouts also, several conflicts in accounts, very interesting.If you're able to get through this without sobbing, feeling shocked, or feeling positively sick in your stomach, then I'd argue that something is maybe a little wrong.It's well made, but one criticism I have, is the deliberate attempt to add a bit of antagonism between to of the interviewees, I didn't think it was necessary given the harrowing topic.It's an outrageous story, genuinely sickening, it makes you wonder how many other organisations were as rotten at their core.8/10.",False
2,8,Very upsetting,CJXzoic1970,n/a,17/08/2025,Even though I personally had a positive experience with Boy Scouts sans a few racist leaders these revelations are extremely upsetting. Is there a lawsuit for victims of racism?? The documentary did a good job finding victims to share their horrible experiences and a few good investigating teams it would have been great to feature more opposing viewpoints. Also to feature positive aspects of scouting. Many troops were completely different from each other! I do hope all of the victims are receiving extensive therapy and support! And whatever criminal men are locked up for life! Nasty! Compensation should be hefty!,False
3,6,Again In the name of HONOR!!!!,li0904426,n/a,17/08/2025,"The movie ""Scouts Honor: The Secret Files of the Boy Scouts of America"" is a documentary that deals with unsettling allegations of sexual abuse within the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). The documentary provides a platform for survivors to share their harrowing experiences. Very similar to the documentary ""Procession"", which explores sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, the director, in this case, Brian Knappenberger embarks on a journey to interview lawyers, journalists, victims of sexual abuse within the Scouts, and senior leaders of the Scouts. This is done to construct a comprehensive view of the decades-long sexual abuse perpetrated against young Boy Scouts.The most alarming aspect is that the leadership of The Boy Scouts of America was reportedly aware of all the cases. Yet, they seemingly prioritized financial power and chose to ""sweep the issues under the carpet"". This raises serious questions about the organization's commitment to the safety and well-being of its members.At times, the documentary tends to be sensational, with a significant number of interviews with young boys who have suffered molestation. There's a sense of an unfinished task. It gives the impression that the movie may not have fully delved into the issues it aimed to tackle.",False
4,6,Heartbreaking for victims but BSA was not all bad!,slzuern,n/a,17/08/2025,First of all I am appalled by the abuse showed in this documentary. As a parent of a Boy Scout and a group leader and friend of many leaders please let the public realize that not all groups or leaders were involved in criminal abuse of children. This makes me so sad! I believe that every organization has good and bad people involved and in my experience I never saw any abuse. There was much good done and is still being done by this group. While I would never defend the terrible things that did happen please recognize the good done by BSA. Please show the good along with the horrible! There are a lot of good leaders still!,False
5,10,Just Like Any Institution With Powerful Men in Charge,Mehki_Girl,n/a,17/08/2025,"Spoiler... Who internally make life very lucrative and cushy for themselves.Many will be shocked to know that the boy scouts harboured sexual predators from day one.Knew about them and harboured them, protected them and hid them from public view; and, then, just like the Catholic Church and the Mormon Church and sports training institutions,etc., which consider themselves too lucrative and ""too big to fail"" did everything in their power to protect the guilty and sacrifice the innocents for name, recognition, and the almighty dollar.This documentary is a mustsee for people who refuse to wake up.Beware because this will evoke negative emotions and may trigger victims of abuse. One particular scene where a, surely he's a sociopath, grins evilly when he reveals his pension is safe (because, of course it is), I nearly went through my screen to throttle his scrawny neck.Could there have been more? Probably, but I'm giving this a 10 for having been made in the first place. Gird yourself and your sensibilities and watch this, but be prepared to be enraged, sickened, disgusted, and, possibly, triggered.",True
6,9,Heart wrenching & important for anyone responsible for protecting children!!,cschu-14136,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this with my husband the day it was released. He is a Life scout and we have both been registered scout leaders since 2017. As active scout leaders, I was surprised how little of the information I knew!I most appreciated the bravery the men who experienced abuse sharing their very intimate and heart wrenching personal stories of abuse. That was the most important aspect of the film. My husband distrusted former YPT Director and I KNEW that former general counsel was flat out lying.This film is a must watch for anyone responsible for protecting children, but needs more info about HOW we can do better!",True
7,10,Officer Mike deserves a medal,territhelin-05191,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThroughout this documentary, Officer Mike is shown to be a fierce defender of the victims, going toe to toe with the powers that be in the uppermost echelons of the BSA. I'm an adult female survivor of incest, and I immediately felt the goodness in Officer Mike's heart. Alternatively, the creepiness of the BSA people trying to talk their way out of any culpability is reminiscent of the creeps often portrayed on Law and Order SVU...except these people ruined the lives of ACTUAL children. None of the victims has received any money from the bankruptcy case, which is infuriating, but now the truth is on public record. Parents, beware of everyone with access to your children. And don't let your kids spend time alone with anyone who constantly seeks access to them. Groomers are often very charming and sly.",True
8,4,"Not good, but important",atleverton,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is not a particularly well done documentary, but I think it is a very important story. It's the story of how the Boy Scouts of America hid abuse from parents and the authorities. It's also the story of how an immensely powerful organization is using bankruptcy proceedings to evade justice. It's also the story of how an organization can claim on the one hand that it doesn't have any problems with abuse and on the other blame any problems it does have on homosexuals. Because, the logic goes, if they can keep homosexuals out of the organization, they can keep abusers out. But that does not make any sense whatsoever. Just think about the logic of that argument for one second, and you'll see how flimsy it is. It's an important story, as I have said, but I think the history of it is much better detailed in a podcast serious called behind the bastards. So if you want it better understanding of this topic you would do better to listen to that podcast about the founder of The Scouting movement Lord Baden Powell.",False
9,10,Essential viewing,idreamofidee,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is a crucial watch for everyone, and probably a good argument to encourage Netflix to create a free catalogue, where they make their most important and informative documentaries available for public access.If there is a child in your life you care about and if you want to understand how pervasive abuse is, then please watch Scout's Honour. It is an especially vital watch for parent/carers to boys, so that we can better understand what stops boys and men from reporting their abuse. There was a lot of harrowing testimony - that detailed how boys were targeted, the impact abuse had on their lives and how they were rendered silence by what happened to them.I could write an essay as to what makes this programme essential, but please just watch it. I cried often, and I am also glad a man like Detective Michael Johnson exists. I am also very proud of the men who shared their experiences with us, they are helping a lot of other children and adults by doing this.",False
10,10,Hard to watch,kaleihinulani,n/a,17/08/2025,"I'll start off by saying how incredibly brave it is for these grown men to talk about what they survived as children. This was hard to watch, these poor boys really suffered at the hands of such evil men. To think these children's parents were so unaware of what was happening really bothered me, common was your young boy not acting out of character after the sexual abuse he was going through? This is not a series but it took me a few days to finish because that's how much their torment affected me. Again I am so proud of these men who finally get to tell their stories and can hopefully start the healing process if it has not begun.",False
11,10,Riveting and infuriating,tonymandichsan,n/a,17/08/2025,"Brian Knappenberger is like a dog with a bone when it comes to documentary filmmaking. He is not afraid to ask the right questions of the right people and doesn't let anything keep him from telling the story authentically. As a result, we are left with an anger inducing, no holds barred dose of reality as it pertains to the Boy Scouts of America and their history of protecting their image at the expense of thousands of boys who were subjected to criminal rape at the hands of scout leaders, employees, volunteers and others associated with scouting. Interviews with survivors are sad but it's empowering that they are given a platform to tell their stories. Really an excellent film.",False
12,4,A tad sensationalized,snsh,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary basically presents four sources:1) Michael Johnson, hired by BSA around 2010 to head up Youth Protection. The documentary presents him as the hero of the story. He talks like he knows all the answers, reminds you several times how he is an expert on the topic, and you can imagine how just his personality would have made his job that much harder.2) BSA's former general counsel, who seems to have a realistic grasp on the issues but comes across as smug.3) Several adults who were abused as scouts.4) Investigators and attorneys for those abuse victims.Overall the film does dramatically present horrible stories of abuse which scouts suffered in the past, but the filmmakers imply that those same conditions still exist at BSA, implying that abuse is still prevalent. More frustrating is that they don't present any evidence at all that this is the case, and worse, they don't even offer any recommendations for what still needs to happen to prevent abuse.",False
13,9,Awful and sickening,MM1057,n/a,17/08/2025,"I haven't even had the opportunity to finish this documentary and I'm already mortified. I am 25 minutes into it and the testimonies are awful. These poor kids had their safety, security and their childhood ripped away from them from disgusting and sick perverts. It's a really good documentary with some unfortunate graphic details that must be heard because we don't understand the gravity of what they gone through if you've never been abused in your life. We're at a time in a country where now we're more aware of these things and people can hide behind their name, title, or employer to protect themselves. Be vigilant for the kids!",False
14,10,This needs to be seen!,vbbeeson,n/a,17/08/2025,"As someone who was a scout for nearly two decades, this tore my heart apart. I was a camp counselor, Vigil member of our honor's society, and an assistant scoutmaster for my home troop, so when I watched this documentary, I couldn't help but to put myself in the shoes of these victims, and it was sickening to see the complete lack of consideration of the safety of children in this program.As long as scouting is treated more like a business than a service to our young people, these horrific things will continue to happen. There are absolutely 0 excuses that can make this alright. I hate to see people saying ""this kind of stuff happens everywhere"" as if that makes the complete lack of national oversight acceptable. This documentary perfectly captures how this organization values money over safety for the kids that make the organization what it is.I cannot begin to express how important it is to see this film in its' entirety. It is difficult to watch, but these stories deserve to be heard, not just by current and former scouts, but also by the general public.I am so grateful for the victims who bravely stepped forward to tell their stories, and for the filmmakers who gave them a platform to be heard.This documentary is not about ""destroying the boy scouts"" it is a call to action for meaningful change so that future scouts do not have to experience the same horrendous treatment at the hands of adults who were supposed to protect them.If you are on the fence about watching this documentary, I implore you to watch every minute of it. Unfortunately, I think the only way that we will see real change in the organization is if their bottom line is affected, and the only way that can happen is if enough people start making their voices heard.I hope to see a second part to this documentary, because I think there are still a lot more stories to tell from the inside of this organization, and this film only scratches the surface.",False
15,10,Highly recommend to watch still heartbreaking,laurenmay-19556,n/a,17/08/2025,It is probably one of the most raw and just heartbreaking documentaries you'll ever watch every interview of every different victim that they got will break you and it's probably one of the most important things to listen to or watch because if it's still going on children are still being abused And it's being covered up and the people who are in this documentary the survivors who are standing up for the rights of those who cannot is one of the most brave empowering things and anyone will ever see those survivors deserve everything and all my love and all my prayers will go out to them and I hope every single one of the victims and the survivors get justice.,False
16,1,Probably the last documentary I ever watch,MarcusAurelius007,n/a,17/08/2025,"Nothing about this documentary is objective. The CDC reports that 1 in 4 girls and 1 and 13 boys is sexually abused in the United States! 1 in 1300 boys (1000 times fewer) have come forward as abused in the BSA. Proposing that the BSA shutdown is no different than if someone proposed that our education system shutdown for any number of reasons (gun violence, sexual abuse etc). I've never heard anyone propose that, probably because it would make zero sense. I use to love documentaries, but this one has proven to me that there is always an agenda. This one is to bring harm to the BSA not to help the victims. I guarantee you that the BSA and all it's volunteers care more about these victims than do any of these plaintiff lawyers! I'll never watch another documentary the same way.",False
17,10,Shocking,herohire-04931,n/a,17/08/2025,"I was a Cub Scout in the mid 60s, then became a Boy Scout up until the early 70s. I thought it was a great organization to be involved in. I was stunned to learn these things that went on. My worst experience was only one summer camp with two control freak veterans trying to make us soldiers like we were in the military!This is an excellent expose documentary! 😱",False

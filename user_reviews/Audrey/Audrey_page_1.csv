1,8,Please cut the ballet scenes,laughing_cat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Of course when Audrey Hepburn is shown, she's mesmerizing. But those dance sequences with other actresses are pointless. Overall it's well done but does not stand out from any other documentaries I've seen about this iconic woman.",False
2,7,"Too much ""not-Audrey"" stuff",copy-apex,n/a,16/08/2025,"We really didn't need the dramatization of the dancers. Not sure what the point of all that was. It would have been much better without that. She was a remarkable, beautiful person and the world was made better by her being in it.",False
3,6,Missed opportunities and unnecessary reenactments,ohmynow,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Audrey and I wanted to love this movie. Although there are moments that shine and much lovely footage of Audrey, this documentary fell flat in many aspects.Worst of all were the absolutely cheesy and unnecessary ""reenactments"" featuring modern day ballerinas dancing - and an awful father daughter reenactment, yikes. Took this from what could've been a beautiful tribute for a timeless star to a made-for-tv c-list movie. How disappointing.The music choices could've been better and many great films were glossed over or missed.The one area that was featured well in this documentary is fashion, I enjoyed both the commentary and the looks showcased, I just wish the other elements of Audrey's very rich life were given the same treatment.",False
4,6,Erratic Yet Fascinating,LaurieMann,n/a,16/08/2025,"It needed tighter editing and tried to be ""overly artsy"" at times, but Audrey Hepburn was still a fascinating individual",False
5,6,"So disappointing, please cut the ballet reenactments",awvknj,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was wonderful to learn more about her early life and see footage of her during her early life and later years, however, the reenactments were very distracting and irritating. They would've been better served to go deeply into her life used that time with regard to her life in Hollywood and afterwards, there was not enough time spent covering her career and memorable moments on screen. This could've easily filled the time that they spent doing these pointless ballet scenes which were supposed to be some artistic representation, but it just didn't work. Even a black-and-white still photo of her is more mesmerizing than watching these people dance who you know or not her.",True
6,6,Saint Audrey,cekadah,n/a,16/08/2025,"Director: Helena Coan shows us the Audrey Hepburn as she is perceived by her adoring fans. And Audrey is more than worthy of their praise. But she was also human and was fallible to human weakness and this part of Ms Hepburn is sorely missing in this bio-docu.I was hoping Helena Coan would show us more of 'Audrey the Hollywood Star' and the power of her opinion in her movie roles (characters}. But the only info we are afforded is her singing in MY FAIR LADY was dubbed, and she demanded the song Moon River stay in BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S. And that's it. Plus her two less than fulfilling marriages.To Audrey's credit she did put her international stardom to good use through her exhaustive work with UNICEF - she had a name and when she spoke people would listen!But at the end of this documentary I felt more emotionally tired than intellectually inspired. What I mean by that statement is that Audrey Hepburn found herself thru humanitarianism via the Hollywood star factory.",False
7,10,Adoringly Audrey....,Ashmystir91,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved this documentary of my all time favorite actress. Heard some already well known facts about her life and learned some new things about her which was nice. Documentary covers her Hollywood life as well as her personal life.She could wear a potato sack and still look absolutely stunning. My heart breaks that she never really loved herself like a lot of the world did and still does. Happy that she at least ended up with a gentleman, Robert Wolders, that made her feel loved. Also that she became the face for UNICEF which meant more to her than being movie star. Would always love to see more about her but this movie did a decent job of it.",False
8,6,Nice Introduction to Audrey Hepburn,stefstars,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a fan of Audrey Hepburn's since I was a teenager. I've read the books on her and seen nearly all of her films. That being said, there wasn't anything new in this documentary for me to learn. I did enjoy the exploration of her relationship with Hubert de Givenchy and all the iconic dresses/outfits that came out of their collaboration, but majority of the film was info that can be found anywhere. I did like the approach they took at explaining who she was as a person - that being, how she took all the negatives she had been through and turned them into positives not just for herself, but for the world. That's a nice lesson for anyone, it's part of why I've always loved her, she didn't let her scars (which were some pretty serious, traumatic ones) hold her down, she used them as experiences to better appreciate the good things that came to her life. I'd recommend this documentary for someone who doesn't know much about Audrey Hepburn to begin with, it's a nice beginners guide to her. If you're not one for reading, then definitely give this documentary a watch, it's a nice summary on Audrey Hepburn.",False
9,10,Heartbreaking documentary of a woman by a woman...,abdulmustabeen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I read a, quite frankly, stupid Guardian review of this film prior to watching and I was scared justice had not been served to my idol, the woman with whom I've always felt a connection. But boy was I glad when I finished watching the doc.
The documentary is woven together by Audrey in her own words, acheived by tapes she recorded for a journalist in the 90s, I believe. I cried too much during this film because here was a human, who nearly starved to death during a war and came out of it with the promise of happy children for the future only to be betrayed by the false promises of a capitalist and post-colonial society. Audrey had immense sorrow in her. From the abandonment of her father, to the war and the eventual disloyalty from her partners. But at the end, Audrey found love. She did find someone who understood her and she did find respite by opening the eyes of the world to what the inhumane politics of the 20th century did to the lives of the innocent new citizens of this Earth. Audrey was one of a kind. Her legacy of being a fashion icon is touched upon early on in the film too, as the mood changes from light to dark. No doubt, her fashion will always inspire us. Because the woman who wore it had heart. The lines, the colors and the mood followed which then created a character like no other. Audrey, you are alive more than ever...",False
10,7,Good but Flawed Portrait,d3193,n/a,16/08/2025,"Audrey Hepburn's life is covered well and movingly. Audio of her telling her own story and archival interviews are a big plus. However, there are some surprising omissions of film performances. Of course, licensing and clearing clips is notoriously expensive, so some missing films are to be expected. But it is surprising to find no mention of ""Charade""; Universal is credited as ""presenting"" this portrait, and Universal owns ""Charade."" There is probably an interesting back-story here.Hepburn's early life is well-known and in itself dramatic, her later commitment to UNICEF is very moving., and the bits in-between are well told here. But the biggest flaws are the use of reconstructed scenes and the ballet sequences. It's quite likely that the project was sold on the basis of the new dance elements, and the film-maker clearly fell in love with them. But they just get in the way of what is already compelling and moving story.",False
11,9,Awesome Audrey,girvsjoint,n/a,16/08/2025,"A near perfect documentary of this much beloved movie icon, my only real complaint would be the over use of a not so look alike ballerina that keeps popping up and swirling around, that aside, it's a pretty comprehensive over view of a life, although relatively short lived, packed with a lot of highs and lows, a seemingly fragile in appearance, yet surprisingly strong woman. Haunted by the desertion of a Father she loved, plus many insecurities, she somehow overcame them and in the end gave back selflessly to the World that had given her so much. May her Star continue to shine brightly",False
12,7,Beautiful documentary about Audrey Hepburn,Sasha_Lauren,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shining star Audrey Hepburn's young life was marked by trauma and loss during World War II. As a teen liberated from the oppression of war, she was a talented wanna be ballet dancer who came to her training in Amsterdam too late to be skilled enough to be a prima ballerina. She went on to become an exhuberant, beloved movie star, creative fashion icon, devoted UNICEF humanitarian, and doting mother that stepped out of a magnificent film career at it's height to stay home and care for her son.Audrey is a gushing portrait about the joys and sadness, loves and losses, glory and challenges of Heburn's life. There is an element throughout the film of three ballet dancers in various stages of their lives pirouetteing around to punctuate the narrative, which I found odd, but nevertheless, the film is wonderful to watch because of Audrey.Her family members, among others, are interviewed. Having been abandoned as a child by her father, whom she cherished, Audrey struggled to find true love and acceptance throughout her life. Several of her husbands hurt and betrayed her, and she was hounded by gossip when she lived in Rome.Through it all Audrey remained true to her radiant integrity, which for me sums up her loveliness.",False
13,3,Very frustrating.,JLA-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Perhaps I know too much about Audrey Hepburn.I know they leave out the best part of her screen test for ""Roman Holiday."" I know the marquee for ""Gigi"" is for the movie, not the play she was in. And I know how many of her great movies are omitted. But, basically, I know they never capture what made Hepburn the incandescent star she was.In fact, there aren't that many clips of her actually speaking in her movies. At the end of ""Roman Holiday,"" she drops her voice to say she will keep her visit, ""..in memory as long as I live."" It's a lovely reading of that line. There are great moments from, ""Two for the Road,"" and ""Charade,"" and those movies aren't even mentioned.I think Audrey took pride in her acting, yet you see little of that talent. She is mostly shown as an icon of style at many gala events. Too bad they don't show what made her a great and charming actress.",False
14,7,Nothing more invasive than a bad soundtrack,dffinance,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nothing more invasive than a bad soundtrack. I tried watching it once and gave up after I fast forwarded it to about 15 minutes and it was still going strong in the background. I did hold out and in spite of the music the story, the interviews and the film clips made it worthwhile watching. Why didn't somebody say something when they heard this. I get the feeling that it might've been a family member or a lover that suggested this music.I wasn't very impressed with the ballet in the beginning in the end. However that seems to be so much subjective. The soundtrack is not.Coincidently I just saw ""breakfast at Tiffany's ""which had a magical theme song and a wonderful soundtrack.",False
15,8,wonderful tribute to a woman who's style will never fade,howboutthisone_huh,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie reminded me of a quote I heard one time:""Greatness occurs when your children love you, when your critics respect you and when you have peace of mind."" -- Quincy JonesIt's hard to believe that a woman of her beauty and much more could be insecure but if that's the life she had it's too bad she never saw this film because it's a wonderful and loving tribute to both the icon and the woman that she was.",False
16,10,We must learn from her,arashhkosari,n/a,16/08/2025,"She's the most iconic star in the history of cinema, we never forget her.
I love you Audrey Hepburn to the end of the days. RIP the true human.",False
17,10,Audrey 2020,barbarazinhaguimas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everything we needed in the middle of a world pandemic . We all are so blessed to had Audrey she was a such revolutionary woman to the world she is an inspiration for young girls and teenagers , a true icon , not only for her beauty , her fashion or talent but also as an a humanitarian she helped Unicef so much to grow and be what it is today . Unfortunately she passed away suffering a lot with cancer but the legacy that she gave to us is a truly present and a hope to not be erased by another actress and possibly will never exist another actress like her but I hope that other actresses that are coming could have the same values as she had such as family and help the others . I love it , I love it and I love it so much it was an amazing experience to me such as a fan but also as a human being .",False
18,4,Disappointing,keeks-42450,n/a,16/08/2025,"Many omissions make this biography extremely unsatisfying. One of her sons is completely absent from this life story. Her possible anorexia, or at least highly problematic relationship with food as a result of starvation during WWII, is essentially ignored. I found the dance sequences during which she was portrayed at different ages by various ballerinas superfluous and irritating. All in all, this film feels very insubstantial and inadequate to represent such revered and admired icon.",False
19,8,The headliner steals the show,elisa-grant,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story of Audrey's life is so rich and interesting that any documentary on her life is enriching to the viewer.Over dramatisation isn't needed as there is ample in Audrey's life to satisfy even the most artist director - you'd think. This one felt it necessary to add in all these ballet scenes to ""set the tone"" and that's fine but they could have been cut in half with the same effect.Other than that.... the movie is enjoyable. Just could have been filled with more of the ample film and photos available of Audrey's life and the impact of her life on pop culture.Interviews with family and friends are beautiful though. So sad her granddaughter never got to meet her.",False
20,9,"Great documentary about a icon, humanitarian, and lovely woman",namob-43673,n/a,16/08/2025,"Audrey Hepburn is one of the biggest movie stars of all time. She is one of the most beautiful women of all time. She was, and still is, a fashion icon. But Audrey was so much more than that and what made her into such a fantastic person was her life story and her big heart and that is what this documentary shows.She lived an extraordinary life and were a lovely person that not only won oscars and spoke several languages, she was also a great humanitarian that helped UNICEF to actually care about children and the starving - something that organisation forgot lately. I found myself crying during that part of the documentary since it is so sad to think about that people are still starving in the world due to restrictions, socialism and other sicknesses. Children are still dying by the millions and today even more millions are dying because we in the west do not want to catch a Chinese cold.So the story is a great one. The person Audrey was a great one. And this documentary show this in a great way.With that said, there are also a couple of negatives. The music used is not always fitting. I would also like to have seen a bit more about her acting career, which is partly passed over. I can also feel it was a bit short. There is so much more to be said. Could have made a documentary for 2 hours only about her time in the Netherlands during WW2.However this is still a great time spent and I highly recommend. I give this a 9/10 due to the emotional impact it had on me, but perhaps that is slightly too high.",False
21,8,THE ONE & ONLY...!,masonfisk,n/a,16/08/2025,"An informative Netflix documentary of the silver screen's most luminous actress; Audrey Hepburn. Born to dire straits during WWII in Europe but still able to scratch her performing itch by becoming a dancer which led to her getting a series of bit parts (famously a walk-on of sorts in The Lavender Hill Mob) but when cast in William Wyler's Roman Holiday, she became a superstar overnight (winning a Best Actress Oscar for her troubles). Seemingly to have the Midas touch when it came to iconic roles, Hepburn could do no wrong (even partnering w/fashion designer Givenchy to cultivate not only getting the right roles but looking spectacular doing it). Famously retiring after making Wait Until Dark for about a decade, her star never faltered due to her philanthropic pursuits (even becoming the ambassador for the United Way) Never finding the kind of happiness in her lovelife, she did manage to devote herself to her children & the friends in her orbit. Effortless in her beauty & grace, Hepburn epitomizes a kind of celebrity which is rare in our rapid, like or subscribe times.",False
22,5,AUDREY Deserves Better,blpkst,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Audrey,"" The new documentary on Netflix, begins with a reenactment of a ballerina that the makers took pains in hoping we the viewer would be fooled into thinking it was Audrey Hepburn. Talk about starting on the wrong foot. The documentary plods through her early life. Yikes her family were Nazi sympathizers! She of course was not and even ran resistance in WW2. It takes a long time to get to Hollywood with little time on her best films, ""Roman Holiday"" and ""Sabrina."" Too much time on the iconic ""Tiffany's"" which is all splash and no mention of later work, i.e. ""Robin & Marian.""It is wonderful seeing her at various public events dressed so beautifully. She was a living breathing work of art. So many of us loved her so much. To hear of her unhappy marriages was painful but I am not suggesting the pain should have been left out.The documentary needed serious editing, less filler and those horrible re-enactments left on the cutting room floor. One hour of the best would perhaps have saved this documentary from being a mess.Audrey's UNICEF work remarkable. She was a truly remarkable person but a little of that aspect goes a long way.",False
23,8,Marred by background music,jate-88860,n/a,16/08/2025,"Otherwise great documentary about the remarkable gracious and altogether lovely Audrey Hepburn. The music playing in the background is not lovely, at times sounding like an ice cream truck; and the cutaways to ballet dancers also not edifying. No reason to cut away from actual Audrey Hepburn.",False
24,9,Lovely and poignant biography about a beautiful human being,WKaty,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't expecting to, but I learned so much about Audrey in this film. I've always been a fan, but did not know much about her personal life. I didn't know how intelligent she was or how many language she spoke or all the trauma she suffered as a child. The film made me love her even more. I didn't think that was possible
Although the footage is repeated several times in several places, the filmmakers did a great job of assembling footage and photos of various stages of her life and using interviews of people important in her life as well as her own words to paint a more complete picture of Audrey. She was so much more than a pretty face.",False

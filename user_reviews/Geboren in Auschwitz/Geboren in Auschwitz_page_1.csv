1,10,Children of line of survivals,satanmladsi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just now understand many things as I'm children of line of survival. I have 2 months old daughter and I'm really scared how I will be able to cut the line. It's really scary thinking about last 150 years of my family, what need to survive and how from generation to generation make survival instinct and how lead this feeling make them stronger but whiteout emotion.",False
2,10,Excellent movie - it is more about the relationsip between two generaton rather than focusing on holocaust,nagybela-96296,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think it's a very good film, the directors have already shown what they capable of with series called 'On the Spot', this time they just stayed behind the cameras, but it's brilliant.I approach it from a different perspective, I think the Holocaust is less important, and it doesn't highlight it but rather this film is about two generations who don't understand each other.Since I am in a similar situation ((I am younger) but not of Holocaust descent), but because of my family situation, I understand perfectly what the 71-year-old woman went through, that she gave up everything for her daughter just to be good for her because she loves her daughter.Just because she didn't say I love you or hug her, she still gave her everything, but her daughter doesn't interpret it that way and can't appreciate all of the pains and efforts that lady has done and giving up her own life even even in her older years in order to please her daughter. As I mentioned, I am in a similar situation, so I understand the old lady's point of view perfectly.But the last sentence the old lady says, when she walks on the dam (and the camera moves away from the lady) puts the whole point on the conversation (I'm not spoiling that sentence here) - I totally agree with her. For me this movie is 10/10.",False

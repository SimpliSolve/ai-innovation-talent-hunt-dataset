1,3,Inaccurate,ahwfren,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is beyond inaccurate. It gives straight up wrong information, and the hypotheses of the teams are only half formed at best. Then you have a ""marine biologist"" that wants to collect DNA from saliva.... made is salivary glands sharks doesn't have. The sheer number of uncontrolled and unaccounted for variables in their experiments is ridiculous. The whole thing is a bunch of the bottom of the barrel biologists anthropomorphizing sharks. The whole thing just smacks of future plans to cull ""problem individuals"". The only person even a little credible is the same expert on shark bites that every shark documentary has, but he still only really cares about the attacks and not the reason behind them, and he says the same exact thing in every single documentary.",True

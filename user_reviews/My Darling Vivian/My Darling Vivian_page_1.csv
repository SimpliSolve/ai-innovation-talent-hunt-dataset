1,7,Facts counter fiction of I WALK THE LINE,dlsaltzberg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Enjoyed the film; fascinating how history can be rewritten by the ""victors,"" even if those victors are screenwriters, directors or producers with a point of view.Great home movies and photos.Loved the differing memories of Viv and Johnny's daughters--""Really? I don't remember it that way,"" one quietly murmurs at her sister's words. The film builds power through the daughters' loving testimonies, the weight of family photos, and interspersed film clips showing life in the '50s, '60s through the '90s and aughts.Right now, I want to complain about IMDb, one of my sacred websites...How can they list the first two stars of MY DARLING VIV as Joaquin and Reese?! Why aren't Vivian and Johnny Cash first and foremost?For shame!!!",False
2,7,"vivien's story, told by the kids",ksf-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is listed as a documentary, and features some of the cash children, so one expects that there is some amount of truth in what is being portrayed. It was even produced by tara cash. Lots of family legends and stories, some of which are nice and cozy, some of which are not. Lots of family stories, photos, videos that we've never seen before. They talk about the drug use. How vivien was left high and dry, financially and personally, when june came along. Even the church abandoned vivien, because of the divorce. The story is told almost exclusively from the point of view of the children, who were quite young when this all occurred. It's well done. Vivien, john, and june are all gone at this point, so clearly they won't have a chance to comment. Directed by matt riddlehoover.",False
3,9,They Tried to Erase Her,kimschut,n/a,16/08/2025,This was a lovely and heartbreaking film. The story of a woman who found herself in a life she did not choose with a man who was not being a great deal of help. It was wonderful to hear the story of this woman who was essentially erased from Cash's history by those who chose to mythologize his relationship with June Carter. The portrait that emerges from the interviews with their 4 daughters is complex. Highly recommend this for a different view on the Johnny Cash myth.,False
4,10,A voice given,CaitlynsWay,n/a,16/08/2025,"My Darling Vivian is a well put together documentary telling the life story of Johnny Cash's first wife, Vivian Liberto, through their four daughters.Most people aware of Johnny Cash's story only know Vivian as the first wife he was already married to when he fell in love with June Carter. But this story gives a glimpse into his life before fame, before drugs, and before the ""Johnny and June"" love story was over romanticized by both Hollywood and CMT.
This documentary doesn't take away from that, but it gives you a perspective on the people that suffered because of Cash's fame and drug use. Being gone for long periods of time leaving Vivian to fend for four children alone. All while trying to deal with crazy fans, the threat of wild animals, her husbands drug addiction, and extramarital affair. Also seeing how this effected their four daughters, particularly the oldest three.
What I loved most about this doc, was the honesty from the interviewees. They were honest about their frustrations with all of the adults in their life. Parents, Step-Parents, everyone played a role. It's being able to be honest with yourself and understanding that our parents are flawed human beings who somehow unintentionally mess us up in the process, but we love them anyway.Vivian's voice was never heard in her lifetime. And there's something beautiful about it coming to light now. In the hands of those who loved her. Not some Hollywood Producer looking to make millions. I really hope this film goes as far as it possibly can.",False
5,10,A must see,bonderenka,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just a wonderful, gracious look into who Vivian really was.. I felt like walk the line tarnished this poor woman and that it was so slanted to make her look bad, this documentary really gave a good look into who she really was.. all 4 daughters told her story without tarnishing the memory of anyone else involved.. so gracious.. you could tell they loves and respected both their mom and dad.. what a hard story to tell and they did it with pure love.. not an easy task..",False
6,10,Stunning,amyjj-84210,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely loved this movie. Vivian was one strong woman, and I enjoyed her truth. At the end of the day through all of the pain, she was a mother and grandmother. And despite her self doubt, she was so beautiful and loved.",False
7,10,What a treasure!! An admirable tribute to Vivian (Cash) Liberto.,hsixfam,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hollywood could never write a love story as pure and loving as Ms. Vivian's. This documentary brought Vivian out of the shadows that Hollywood cruelly casted on her for decades. The life Vivian endured for 13 years as Mrs. Cash was far from a glamorous one. Vivian was a woman of courage and strength. She endured so much without any support from those in the music industry. She had to figure many things out on her own and yet she was the wife of the biggest new country star, though she felt so lonely. She had no voice, no outlet and spent most of her time isolated with her four little girls. This documentary broke my heart because I could feel her pain. Though in the beginning everything was like a fairly tale and life seemed good, even though they didn't have much, they knew they had each other. As time went on and the ""rags to riches"" became a reality, Vivian's life sadly turned for the worst. Ms. Vivian's persona was perceived as loving, far from selfish, classy and very reserved. She truly walked the line for the one she always loved, but sadly she was left with only empty promises. Thank you to the Cash daughters for bringing their mother's story to light and for allowing Ms. Vivian to finally shine!!!",False
8,n/a,Nice to experience another story,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,I enjoyed and appreciated the love and personal perspectives in this well made documentary. The sharing by all four daughters made this powerful story even more so. The never before seen photos and home movies put me in the intimate story. Being a Cash family appreciator was enhanced by knowing much more about Vivian and her powerful story. The love put into this film comes forward in an honest way; thank you.,False
9,5,There is a hypocrisy to this documentary.,MyMovieTVRomance,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a documentary, this was a fun watch. But, there is a hypocrisy and irony to it:This was made as a rebuff to ""I Walked the Line"" about Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, which painted Vivian in a rather negative light compared to June, according to many who've seen it. But, the irony is that this documentary does the same to June, paints her in a negative light, makes her seem like a home-wrecker (even though Johnny and Vivian were already having problems by the time he met June and they were already emotionally separated), and the daughters speak of her with no affection at all, even though she was their step-mom and mother to three of their siblings! They reminded me of bratty kids who scream ""You're not my mother!"" to a dad's new love, spoiling what could be a beautiful bond.At one point, one of the daughters talks about a letter she found that Vivian wrote to Johnny but didn't send, wherein she had asked Johnny to please tell June to stop referring to their daughters as hers. I kinda get where she was coming from, but what she apparently failed to realize is that it's better for the kids to be embraced by the step-mom than to be rejected by her! Many step-children complain of the opposite of what Viv's kids had- and they wish their step-parents would embrace them as their own!Speaking of step-parents, they also spoke disparagingly of their step-dad, whom Vivian stayed married to until her death! Considering that their marriage lasted until the end, it was gross to hear one of the daughters say things like ""Why him?... I didn't like him very much"" and making it seem like he only married Vivian for the perks of semi-celeb status! Honestly, the daughters revealed themselves to be not very likable in this. I'm surprised more people don't notice or comment on how rude they come across. The only one who really seemed nice to me was the youngest one, Tara.I'm sure June was not trying to take the girls away from Vivian, she was just trying to love them, so that they could be one big, happy family. It's a pity that the girls don't seem to appreciate that, and instead describe her as rude, a homewrecker, etc. The hypocrisy is that their mother Vivian's 2nd husband was married when she started seeing him! So, her daughters have no room to criticize June in that regard! That being said, I am not very fond of June at all. She comes across as fake to me in interviews and such, and I don't think she should have made out like she was raising the girls if she wasn't, even for comic effect. Still though, the girls seem very callous and unloving to both their step-parents, and I find that very distasteful. In the wrong or not, they were family and should have cared more.I do think that it's terrible that Vivian was erased by networks during the Johnny Cash Memorial tribute, and I do think she should have been more acknowledged over the years. But, I also understand that with both Johnny and Vivian having remarried, talking about the previous spouse could easily be seen and felt as disrespectful to the current one, so I totally get perhaps why she wasn't mentioned more. While people try to make it about race these days, I think it had more to do with not wanting to disrespect current spouses, and that makes total sense.Yes, this documentary is just as slanted against June as critics say the movie ""Walk the Line"" is against Vivian. As long as you're objective enough to realize that, maybe you'll come away with a feel for the true story, whatever that may be.All in all, I came away from this with very little respect left for any of them, and liking everyone a lot less. So, the doc didn't accomplish what it set out to do- at least not with me- but I know more now than I did before watching, so it wasn't a total loss. However, I rather wish I didn't. Ignorance is bliss.",False
10,10,A good perspective view of her,elaineshold,n/a,16/08/2025,Loved this documentary of Vivian. It gives us insight of everything she went through. Her daughters tells us as if we were physically there watching this unfold.,False
11,10,Wonderful film!,rachann-47888,n/a,16/08/2025,This a wonderful film! I'm so glad Vivian got the chance to tell her story.,False
12,10,Excellent!,cavegirl-78037,n/a,16/08/2025,"My Darling Vivian is a wonderful, must-see documentary. I loved the old home movies and photographs and the daughters giving their account of events is priceless. If you enjoy documentaries, you will not be disappointed. The heartbreak in the film is a little sad but leaves you knowing there was also a lot of love. Thank you for sharing such a great story.",False
13,10,A real love story from her daughters,davidajoseph,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, I'm in tears. It was a beautiful, heart wrenching love story. I'm not crying. 😭 I highly recommend.",False
14,10,Impressive and insightful documentary about Vivian Cash,agnesvillwock,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an exceptional, touching, and outstandingly produced movie. I read Vivian Cash's autobiography some years ago (please go ahead and read it!), and I am so glad that this documentary gives her the voice she deserves. The producers have really managed to portrait the life of Vivian Cash from an intimate and honest, yet always respectful perspective. The individual reflections from all her daughters left an especially big impression on me. Highly recommended!",False
15,4,"Worth Watching, But Be Cautious",graceclark-58642,n/a,16/08/2025,"Heartfelt but depressing and this movie is not for everyone. Unless you are someone who is very interested in Johnny Cash or the human tragedy of families and marriages falling apart when one spouse goes on a different path, I don't think you would like this documentary. It's a life celebration of a elegant, good woman that deserved better than the life she got, not a tabloid story.It's very easy for someone to listen to this story of Vivian Liberto and her romance with the young Johnny Cash and think that these two had a lovely romance and that had it not been for drugs and fame, they would have been married to the end. I'm sorry to the daughters of Vivian and Johnny but if anything this is only a story of their mom being in love with their dad. For all his promises of lifelong love, he sure didn't mean them and it didn't take long as far as marriage years go before they were broken. I mean, according to letters Johnny Cash wrote his business manager, which have been uncovered recently, he started his affair with June about 8 years into the marriage with Vivian. And he began dreaming of a life with June long before Vivian realized things were not right in the marriage.I wish more than anything Vivian Liberto had chosen somebody else for that beautiful family life in the '50s that she dreamed of, that she deserved. Because Johnny Cash was never going to give her that dream. One could argue she had no way of knowing he would become so famous so quickly, and that's a fair argument but she and he were from different planets. It is heavily hinted by Roseanne, Kathy, Cindy and Tara that their parents married in the haze of young love and didn't quite know what they wanted when they married. It makes the viewer wonder, what would have happened if these two hadn't rushed to get married after he got out service? What would have happened if they had gotten some decent pre marital counseling? Would all the heartbreak have been avoided?Very surprising and a welcome one to hear how honest all of the Cash daughters were about their mom's shortcomings as well as shortcomings in the marriage. They don't try to sugar coat their mom much. They were very open that Vivian was not cut out for life in the spotlight as a celebrity's wife. Roseanne in particular was very Frank about Vivian's vulnerabilities that left her unequipped to deal with a husband away so much.For all the sweet home movies that are shown, you still get the sense that the end is inevitable for this couple. He became famous almost immediately after Roseanne was born and his career snowballed so quickly no one could keep up! And not just when the family moved out to California, although I do believe moving to California sped up the end. Much of the divorce is blamed on Johnny's drug use and months-long absences, even Kathy says at one point that their dad left the marriage in his mind long before the divorce was filed. I can see how both issues played a big role in the divorce, but I still say the biggest problem was Vivian and Johnny should never have married. Vivian was a tender, loyal woman who could not understand maybe that that sweet young man she loved was not who she thought he was going to be. She deserved someone who would have made her happy, and despite his promises Johnny's actions showed he was not going to make her happy.It was disappointing to hear how much abuse Vivian put up with, and how little Vivian respected herself throughout the marriage. I mean, starving yourself almost to the point of death because of your husband's affairs? Neglecting your kids to the point where they're petrified you're going to kill yourself? Sometimes it's difficult to respect Vivian because of what she put her own children through. If any reviewer is critical of Johnny's abandonment of his wife, there should be criticism against Vivian damaging her daughters.After the divorce, Vivian spent a comfortable life, made comfortable by the royalties, alimony and child support from the Cash estate. Living, according to her daughters, an outwardly happy life serving her church, her family and her community. Meanwhile Johnny with June traveled the world together, became one of the most powerful couples in music history, and lived more life than most people ever will. They both got the life each wanted; it just didn't happen with them together. More proof that despite what Ms Distin thought to her dying day, they were not meant for each other.The most puzzling aspect is this expectation that we're supposed to be angry over what life handed Vivian? Or at the media? Nashville? I'm sorry, couples fall out of love and get divorced! When you divorce, you move on with somebody else and you don't talk about your broken marriage. The media may have been following Johnny's wishes for privacy. Or they may have decided they liked June better. I hate to burst people's utopia bubble but that happens! People and families decide they like a new partner better. And as for the Wake of Johnny and June at the Rhyman that the girls criticize so much, it was dedicated to them and their fantastic career together. They made music history together, why on Earth would Nashville and it's stars mention any previous marriages they had before? That wasn't relevant.And I doubt anybody mentioned at all at Vivian's wake her divorce, and her exes!This is one reason why my review was lower. I think quite a few of Johnny's daughters are angry children. Mainly I think Cindy and Kathy. I don't know whether they're mad at the world or mad at their dad, but I don't care. They need to accept what happened and move on, and not try to attack June Carter for being inclusive, or people for being people. Especially after they were given quite comfortable sums of money from their dad's estate. I wouldn't have been complaining if I were that lucky.No, This movie doesn't really change my feelings for Walk the Line. Hollywood always fudges with the real story. They didn't exactly portray Johnny's father in the best light, and made him a downright bast#_. Nobody complained about that. I think a mature person can enjoy the movie anyway, despite the incorrect narrative about a witchy wife.",False
16,10,Kills Walk the Line,pcn-42651,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc was amazing. It gives an amazing woman the defense she deserves. Be warned, Walk the Line will never be the same. Personally I'll never be able to watch walk the line again, it's so false, or at least one sided. She was an amazing wife, mother and woman who loved a man far more than he deserved.",False
17,10,Johnny Cashed out on the best investment in his life!,jdsantos-95954,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm sure he knew it too upon any honest self-reflection over his lifetime. I'm not diminishing anything he had between June Carter - I'm sure it was great, but after watching the story of his first wife Vivian I am certain he had regrets about how he treated her and his girls.
Vivian by all appearances was a good, strong woman and a classy lady that she allowed Johnny's life to play out on the world stage and did nothing in an attempt to take him out or tarnish his reputation in any way.
Towards the end, the youngest daughter laments a letter her mom had written to her dad and never having sent it - about leaving them out June's claim on them as their daughters - but I am sure just having written the letter in itself, Vivian experienced the healing she needed.
Great film and I am thankful to have heard a little about her story. Wish I could have told her in person what a great example she is for all in how to handle the dissolution of a marriage.
Thanks for making the video available on Prime!

18,10,Johnny and Vivian Cash,marybirkel,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just finished watching Matt's documentary, My Darling Vivian....about one of the greatest love stories of all time!! So much insight into Vivian's love story with Johnny Cash and the undeniable fact that their love never died. So moving and I am writing this with tears of joy and heartbreak. A must see for all fans of Johnny Cash! I recommend reading Vivian's book, I Walked The Line, written just before she passed away.
Thank you for making this film, Matt Riddlehoover. Thank you to their daughters, for sharing their inner most private thoughts of their parents' lives, during their marriage and after their divorce, that could not have been easy to do. It's clear, they both loved you all so much and did the best they could with what they knew at the time. May God bless you all! I've no doubt your parents are smiling down on the beautiful family they created by loving each other.",False
19,10,"Entertaining, Informative and So Very Well Done",artist-823-928087,n/a,16/08/2025,"To say this particular film is touching or emotional, is an understatment. Understatement... Yes everything about this film is understated, which is why it is
so impressive, passionate and enduring. This is not an easy or comfortable story, but Matt Ridlehover directed a home run here. Dustin Title along with his mother and aunts tell a hard story. Vivian was a complex woman, and we all know the icon who was her husband. Dustin and Matt were able to get the real Vviain across to the viewer in an entertaining, respectful and extremely forthcoming way. To be bold, this film is not a contender for a festival prize, it is a winner. Don't take my word for it, watch My Darling Vivian and be taken on emotional journey with an amazing mother, wife and lady.",False

It was a beautiful piece dedicated to a woman who was long overdue for the recognition she deserved. Watching it both uplifted me and broke my heart. It is one of my all time favorite documentaries and I loved the light it shined on her life and how hard she worked to keep her girls at the forefront. Beautiful tribute to a phenomenal woman.,False

I'm So Glad I could figure out how to work my Prime Video on the tv so I could view this documentary. Very well written when it could've easily been a big bash fest, it just goes to show how her grace and dignity carried on to her daughters. I dont want to spoil it for others so just watch this yourselves. It's both heartwarming and sad at the same time. Vivian dear, you were one class act. May you Rest Peacefully now.",False

Through their 4 daughters; Roseanne,Kathy,Tara and Cindy you will get the first hand in depth story of what their mom was like. There are also many great private home videos and photographs that chronicle this great documentary which will stir all your emotions.

24,10,Best Documentary I Have Ever Seen👏👏👏,brendaleenewton,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched this tonight. This has got to be the greatest documentary I have ever seen. Vivian, what a remarkable classy woman you were.
You raised 4 beautiful daughters All while being under the scrutiny of the public. I loved Johnny Cash, I have even named my son Cash after him. I'm so glad that the world gets to see her side of the story. This didnt make me love Johnny Cash and his music any less but it sure made me see her side for sure. I hate that she had to go through all that pain that I'm sure she tucked deep inside. Thank you for a wonderful epic documentary.

25,10,The forgotten wife...,misssamgibbs,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is the love story of Johnny Cash and his first wife Vivian. Its told by their 4 daughters. It shows the rise and fall of their love story from Vivian and their daughters point of view. It is beautifully done but also sad. You get to hear from the other spouse and family their side of the story and the demise of their (Johnny and Vivians) relationship and family. It's not like how the movie 'Walk the Line' makes it out to be. And as much as we all believe that Johnny and June belonged together, it hurt a family and hurt Vivian more than you can imagine. Would definitely recommend.",False

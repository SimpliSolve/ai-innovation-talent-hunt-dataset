1,10,Amazing,animalcrackers-20375,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am so grateful to BTS for putting this on the big screen. Not many of us Armies were lucky enough to experience this concert in person, especially those international armies like myself and it felt so close and intimate watching them on the big screen. It was amazing, their voices and stage presence is SPECTACULAR. I enjoyed it so much and even cried towards the end. Watching in in 4DX was also a new experience and made it so much more fun haha. For those of you who have not tried 4DX I definitely recommend. Thank you for an amazing performance and for sharing it with us once again BTS. Borahae!",False
2,10,BTS are LEGENDS,colewaters,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have seen this in the theater that I work at 4 times and counting and it gets better and better every time. So glad they extended it till Thursday. The vocals are so crisp and clear. Every song is a hit. BTS never disappoints. I love them and I am a straight male. Personally my favorite song is Dope. That song is so so good. The dancing was on point as always.Army this made 9.5 million dollars. ARMY Im so glad that we all have stuck with these amazing human beings. They are talented and so gifted.If you are a fan of BTS, then you have to go see BTS Yet To Come In Cinemas. It's a must for sure!!!ARMY I PURPLE YOU.",False
3,10,Thank you BTS,MissyG_07,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not being able to fly halfway around the world to watch a FREE concert was a reality for a lot of I-ARMY, so being able to see it in theatres was a wonderful gift. While I wished that it hadn't been edited to exclude some funny moments and weird editing of the ending-ment, it was still perfect. I cried, sang, danced, and even befriended another ARMY seated next to me. I hope anyone who was able to see it at a theatre near them had a wonderful time. If it wasn't available where you live, I send you a ðŸ’œ and hope this isn't the last time we're blessed with a concert in theatres. BH, please give us the unedited version on DVD/Bluray.",False
4,10,Fun for both fans and non fans,jiminparkslays,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing experience, watching YTC on a big screen just hit different compared to watching it on your phone. The camera quality is great, their voices are clear and the fans screaming in the crowd aren't loud enough to disrupt the experience. The editing is high quality.If you watched it in the cinema then you most likely heard people sing along (in my case it was not annoying and only when necessary) and it really is great. It's very interactive since the members urge everyone to join and have fun.There are a variety of songs, which is why I think it'd give a non army an idea of what bts is like. Two people who aren't (or weren't, haha) into BTS went with me and they thoroughly enjoyed it, one of them was previously a BTS hater too. Obviously everyone has different music tastes, but there's bound to be at least one song that's enjoyable for non fans.The ending is emotional for army's ðŸ˜” why did they have to make it sad? (Don't mean this in a bad way though, it really is a special experience).",False
5,10,Had a blast,acumforever,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved every minute of the concert and danced and sang to all of the songs. Took my Army bomb and enjoyed the ScreenX viewing for the first time too. The movie theatre where I went offered poka as well as special BTS tickets to celebrate the event, so I took advantage of every perk. Sharing those moments with all the Army in that room, seeing the guys from different viewpoints, being on the lookout for every one of Namjoon's smiles or J-Hope and Jimin's dance moves and missing Jin a bit more with every passing day...I wish I had been able to attend the Busan concert in person but this movie/concert helped ease that longing feeling.",False
6,10,It was amazing,arushimukherjee,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't the fan of BTS at first, but this movie literally changed my Ming and I started to love them, they were talented, the 3 rappers' rapping skills were unique, UGH!. And the vocal line sang their R&B songs with their best vocals and I loved it, it's like soothing for me. They were looking too sexy handsome. When the show starts, I was like I was in the outer space, and suddenly when the show ends, the confetti starts to rain and the fans were starting to cheer and I was like ""Wow, this is amazing!"" And I got the poster, although I didn't get the light stick, now I was playing BTS world, amazing game, and I was getting used to playing the role as their manager and I was enjoying it.",False
7,10,OMG OMG OMG OMG they are literally the kings of KPOP,studentdemotest,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst of all, this was one of the best performances, specially the 1st choreo of Â´RUN BTSÂ´ song, i was completely amazed by their energy, it was so so so consistent throughout the show.. i cant explain in black adn white words but OMG OMG OMG there can be non other groups like BTS, its one in millenium..BTS ARE THE KINGS .....This was just what we armies imagined and they have delivered it yet againWhat an amazing choreography, This performance is definitely one of my Top 5 fave choreos. They are so hyped that made us even more hyped! I love them so much my heart is so happyJ-Hope, Suga, and RM are killin' it with their parts! They are the RAP Hyungs of the group.Jungkook's vocals and stage presence is so powerful. Main vocalist for a reason. Seeing Jungkook perfom on stage is an unforgettable moment. He is literally turning into a beast when he performsJ-Hope is indeed the force. He outperformed Amazing stable live voice and is never out of breath, unmatched stage presence, insane charisma, super accurate and balanced dance moves!! He is so stunningI love the way V added his own flavors to every performance with the killer Expressions. He owns and burns the Stage.JIMIN'S ""VERSATILITY"" IS OUT OF THIS WORLD! That is coming from professional dancers & choreographer. Jimin's got contemporary experience, modern, hiphop & popping which you can actually see that JM integrated them all so well. Jimin is indeed a dance genius!Jin's vocals are the most perfect thing on this planet. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL, HE IS THE VOCAL KING.Jimin hugging taehyung in the end of song.. soo sweet, soulmate they are. V formation, RM being the leader on the top was like a cherry on the cake.. UUUFFFFFFFF!!! No words...They give 200% and enjoys every moment. But dressing in leather is already a blow below the belt.... a fire of fire!!! BTS is a real national treasure!Thank you, BTS for an amazing concert.",True
8,10,BTS Never Disappoints. Greatest Artists Ever.,BulletProofGirl,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this like four times already! First was when it was streamed live online but then it crashed because there were too many people watching. Then, I watched it again when it was finally available for rewatch. Then I watched it with my kid on the big screen when it was released in cinemas, and now I just watched it again with my kid on Amazon Prime. I will never get tired of watching BTS concerts and other contents because they are part of my daily life. They make me happy. This concert in Busan was free and I cant believe I wasnt there. I shouldve been there if only I wasnt over a thousand miles away from South Korea. It wouldve been awesome to watch it in person. The fact that it's free and yet the quality is still top tier like their paid concerts just make me admire them more. They've been wanting to do a free concert for ARMYS and they finally achieved that before they all ventured on their solos then went to the military. Only a few days until Jin is finally released from the military and I'm so excited! I miss them all so much.",False

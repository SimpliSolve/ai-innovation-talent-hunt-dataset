1,9,"A vivid, educative nature series that is going to surprise many!",abhi-sohu,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have loved the BBC Series Planet Earth and while I wasn't expecting a lot from the current series, I am already very intrigued after watching the first episode ""Strange Relations"". The series throws a new light at the dynamic relations that the wildlife all around us posses. The cinematography is mind-boggling, with shots you would not expect to be possible, and information that is only recently discovered. It is educative and does enthuse a sense of responsibility for the environment around us by showcassing such fragile connections, which humans are sure to trample upon without even realising the real impact. A must watch.",False
2,10,Feast for the senses,faizaljimbohari,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just signed up an account just so I can compliment those behind this amazing production.We are not big fans of documentaries but this series has got us riveted just through the visuals and sounds. Really feels like you are inches away from the action and the dramatic creation is just phenomenal. You tend to forget that you are not watching a movie and what's happening is real.Something amazing like this will always makes u wanna binge watch but we are holding ourselves back so that we have something to watch together as family every evening ðŸ˜ŠAnd I'm not gonna even comment on the amazing content. The tagline really says it all- if you think you know nature, think again.And you can never go wrong when you have the smooth sounding Benedict Cumberbatch to narrate.",False
3,9,Amazing New Discoveries about Animals,farshidkarimi,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have watched hundreds of wildlife documentaries, showing amazing behavior and abilities of animals. When I started watching this series, I though I would not see anything new but stunning footage of animals using new filming technology. Each episode depicts some animals that are common features in many other documentaries, such as elephants, hyenas, squirrels, warthogs and the sort. Things seems common too at first and one may say ""oh I have watched it before"" but as the episode moves on, amazing animal abilities and behavior emerge. These abilities have mostly been discovered recently and are so mindboggling that one says ""oh is it really true"" with bafflement.I really enjoyed this informative series and marvel at the beauty and majesty of the animals we selfishly kill, poach and infringe on whose habitats for our arrogant needs and ambitions.",False

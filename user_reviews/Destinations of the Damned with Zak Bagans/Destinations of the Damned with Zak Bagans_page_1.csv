1,3,"If you like Zak Bagans voice, this show is for you",bbpjstock-57244,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is ""Ghost Adventures"" without the ""Ghost"" It should be called ""Spooky Places Narrated by Zak Bagans"" It felt so heavily scripted and poorly acted, I couldn't help but cringe.An introduction to the crew or anything like that would have been nice. Everyone felt disconnected and the stories are just so over the top, it was like Zak was reading me scary stories before bedtime. I wasn't entertained, but more looking forward to the show ending so I could write a legitimate review about what I thought. I'm obviously not an expert, but this show is forgettable and somewhat laughable at times. I miss the old Zak.",False
2,3,A bit boring,rvaoracle,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was excited for this but it wasn't what I expected. Unfortunately Zak Bagans has said in the past he doesn't fly anymore because he fears dying in a plane crash. I think he said he had a nightmare about it. So that's why Ghost Adventures is mainly focused in the west coast of America because he only goes to where he can drive to. He lives in Las Vegas. These shows are mainly ghost stories narrated by Zak with some cringe fake possessions and minimal ghost hunting/evidence. I would say maybe Billy, Jay or Aaron should have traveled to these places but honestly I didn't like the Ghost Adventures house calls shows where they did that and Zak stayed behind. It's just not the same without Zak being there. Say what you will about him but he's the star. Hopefully Zak can overcome his fear of flying someday. If Travis Barker can do it and he was actually in a plane crash, so can Zak! It would broaden the Ghost Adventures reach but I don't know. Maybe with 28 seasons, Ghost Adventures is winding down. That would make me sad cause it's my favorite guilty pleasure show but it's had quite the run and I feel they have exhausted the west coast.",False
3,4,pretty bad,laineyd-15587,n/a,16/08/2025,"Zak can't even bother to show up, he just phoned in his performance. He keeps saying 'my crew, my crew', but it's just faceless unknown bad 'investigators.'
Give this one a miss - it's time for Zak to take his excuses and ego and go away.______

4,2,My crew... no story bad directing,mandijq-58311,n/a,16/08/2025,"If I hear ""my crew"". When he didn't even go, one more time I will go crazy! He sounds like he's begging to be on a pedestal of all importance... humility would go a long way.This series was better as background noise and nothing like Ghost Adventures.It's sad that this was such a flop, I wanted to love it. Demon House was way better from Zak. It was terrifying.This show was like the travel channel when hearing about scary places in the world. Lots of information but no substance in my opinion. It felt forced vs organic and wouldn't make me a believer.Sorry Zak, it's better to work on your GA show than these weird spin offs.",False
5,1,Disrespectful,ashleyisaak,n/a,16/08/2025,"First I want to say that typically I love these kinds of shows but something about this one just felt wrong.Zak spent the entirety of it narrating and claiming everything was due to some stupid curse. I hope the survivors never watch this. Not only did Zak unnecessarilly describe every detail of the horrible death a a woman's daughter, but then they decided to have an actor depict a decapitated priest at the site that they say is the only place for families to honor those they lost. My final straw was Zak claiming that a victims eyes turned black because the curse was taking over her. Are you kidding?Don't waste your time on this garbage.",False
6,1,OMG,chrissb-50799,n/a,16/08/2025,"Please stop giving Zak Bagans new shows. A curse caused a volcano to erupt 40 years later? How stupid do you think people are? I'm not sure how him and his crew went from running in fear in their 1st documentary before he was given a regular show to professing himself as an empath. I'm so sick of him, his shows are garbage. Every little sound is caused by a demon (eye roll), I don't know how anyone lets him into their houses. Since he's now afraid to fly can you please stop giving him new shows...his narration is just ridiculous, way overly dramatic and just mind numbing and his ""specila powers"" always seem to make him feel anger...something I feel watching his shows.",False
7,1,What the hellIs this even about?,lordhelvetica,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a poorly done version of Josh Gates' Destination Truth. Zack is so arrogant that he probably thinks this is good. Zack-it's not good. Nor is GA anymore. Not sure what happened to him but he went from narcissist to SUPER NARCISSIST, and no super powers, as the name suggests.It's a show kind of about nothing where they find nothing and really don't even have a plan of what they're seeking. You're better off watching reruns of the Nature Channel.This show is full of very tenuous suggestions of paranormal explanations which is just stupid. Ghosts aren't making floods happen-get real. Zack, if you're listening, there are no ghosts, just demons, you don't understand what you're messing with. Stop!",False
8,1,Boring,cynstrisspark,n/a,16/08/2025,"Horrible, monotone narration. Nothing to keep your attention. It is like reading an encyclopedia, it might contain some interesting information, but definitely not the way I choose to learn new things. I can do my own internet search and get the same information and look at videos for visuals. This guy is played out, he needs to retire. I know he is mostly regarded as a jerk and is accused of having other paranormal shows cancelled, but I watched his shows to learn about paranormal places and their histories. This one is so boring I kept falling asleep. May be of use to anyone experiencing insomnia. I will not watch another episode, and probably will not support any new shows by him.",False
9,7,"Entertaining, but lacks pacing and direction",kempaustin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Destinations of the Damned is a really interesting look at locations around the world that the average viewer wouldn't dare to enter. From castles to abandoned cities, there is a lot to see. The crew often dives headfirst into local culture, personal anecdotes about locations and their historical significance. However, Destinations of the Damned lacks focus and identity at times. Just as you think the crew will spend some time exploring and investigating these locations, the episode ends or changes subject. I'm unsure if this just meant to be about the location themselves or an international paranormal investigation show. Destination of the Damned is great in concept and in practice, but fails to stick the landing when it comes to pacing and editing. This show could reach its full potential if the crew played a more active role and more time was spend exploring each location. The show is still entertaining none the less.",False
10,1,Very bad,suerec-42024,n/a,16/08/2025,Zac isn't even present. We don't know the crew and any investigations are poor.It feels like it hasnt an dentity....somewhere between a paranormal investigation and a documentary ....and hence doesn't workIt might be better without Zac presenting because he is too strongly identified with paranormal investigations.and Ghost Adventures.It can be informative but because we don't know the crew we can't really trust whether evidence is robust and has been debunkedIt's boring and I stopped watching after 3 rd Episode . It's a shame as I am a fan of Zac and Ghost Adventures and so my expectations were high.,False
11,8,Episode 3 - Fairy Caves,sjmc-62685,n/a,16/08/2025,"To me, this seems great so far.It sounds like the ""unintelligible whisper"" is saying something like: ""Kill the noises that we hear"".I love paranormal investigations but I agree that Zack shouldn't continually say ""my crew"". We all understand it's his crew........no need to repeat it.These shows are all incredibly entertaining and interesting to watch. I love the different ways people respond to the ""ghost noises"".From Zack and his crew (Aaron, Billy and Jay), the Ghost Brothers AWESOME, awesome stuff............I don't even mind Jack Osbourne's ghost hunting.The only thing I'd like to know is: when will I get to join an adventure?",False
12,5,ZAK NEEDS A NEW CREW FOR THIS SHOW,hazelangeleyesxo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show would be pretty good if the crew Zak put together would actually investigate. Clearly none of these ppl are investigators in any type of way.Every episode, you get all this background, the stories, the witnesses, etc.. Then when they go to investigate, everyone says they're scared so they leave. That's it, end of episode, credits roll.Next episode, same thing... build up build up build up, they finally get to the location to investigate.. then, ""I don't like this, time to go"".. end of episode. Nothing is ever captured, seen, or even heard beyond what someone says they saw or heard. But then they want to leave the second something might happen.And apparently everyone gets possessed. They'll be walking and someone will stop and the guy will be like ""yeah so she's possessed right now"" and smacks her on the forehead a few times.. then she's not possessed anymore. Then they move on like that's just normal.So this show is basically a lot of background, stories, legends, and investigations only last until someone gets scared, which is about the 1st two minutes in. Get a real crew, Zak, and this show would be really good.",False
13,1,Destination of the boring show,mzrypntm,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the first time a paranormal show board me to death.Repetitive and Predictable Episodes
After watching a few episodes, it becomes painfully clear that every investigation is essentially the same. The team never actually discovers conclusive evidence, yet every episode ends with statements like ""This is the most haunted place we've ever been or We may never know the truth""conveniently keeping things open-ended for future episodes.Even more frustrating is the obvious lack of skepticism. The show never explores logical explanations for strange occurrences, nor does it attempt to debunk anything. Instead, every small sound or shadow is immediately labeled as paranormal activity, catering more to entertainment than actual investigation.For the love of God please cancel this show Discovery+ before this ruin any further paranormal shows.",False
14,10,Wish there were more episodes,donnaponce-44623,n/a,16/08/2025,"These are great episodes , I can see why the cast wasn't the ghost adventures cast but this isn't that anyway. It's mainly for their safety if you watch it and will understand that they are going to areas that are not safe for travelers from other counties. He really got in to the depths of these locations by putting these crews internationally and the way it was set up is amazing work. I wish there were more episodes ! I keep checking in hopes of it since I saw there were more locations in the opening credits. You won't regret watching... Zack, if you are reading this then I beg you release more episodes.",False
15,10,An outstanding adventure in every episode,kaylagiangiuli,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the very first episode where zak's correspondents are deployed in to thee absolute hellhole that is Armero, Columbia; every episode is a gripping combination of historical story telling of the horrors of various locations and paranormal investigation. Along the way there are many gripping stops of assorted locals and their various anecdotes regarding paranormal experiencesI think this show is great and investigates the paranormal in a unique way!From the very first episode where zak's correspondents are deployed in to thee absolute hellhole that is Armero, Columbia; every episode is a gripping combination of historical story telling of the horrors of various locations and paranormal investigation.

16,10,great,jrnelluc,n/a,16/08/2025,Fully enjoy it. A nice change of pace. Really think people are focusing a little bit too much on things that don't matter here. Pretend zak isn't part of GA's and just enjoy the show for what it is in my opinion. I think it does a good job of doing what it sets out to do. Shows like this are never the best thing in the world. There's nothing groundbreaking here. But if you're a fan of zak and the genre i'm sure you'll enjoy it.There's a lot of people that like to hate on this show or zak for different reasons that don't really make much sense to me. I think it's better to just go into this not expecting much but a story and a spooky atmosphere and have fun with it.,False
17,10,It was the bomb,lissabusch-41873,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI love the show I been the biggest fan I started watching since 2004 and me & my dad watch it all the time, that's how me and my dad become ghost hunters and now my dad is a spirit. And I still going be a big fan forever I am young 31 and still watching his shows that's how I started to believe ghost and I love his show, he is the bomb and he is a human like us. I truly 100% with his shows!!! I believe in Zak Bagans and his crew!!!Your fan Melissa BuschP.s. I give 100 stars on the Show!!!New places and world has seen!!!(No Hates) and you think is bad or fake.I understand how Zak feels.",True

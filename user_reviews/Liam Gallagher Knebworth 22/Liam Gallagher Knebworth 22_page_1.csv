1,n/a,"Fun doc, no Oasis songs",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"As you may have heard by now, this doc contains no Oasis songs even though they were apparently performed at the Knebworth 22 shows. Surprised they weren't able to work something out with royalties or whatever. As half decent as Liam's songs are, I think we can all acknowledge the obvious: the Oasis songs are better. The doc would have been better with them. Why do you have to be so petty, Noel? That's not very rock and roll of you now is it?But this is still a fun rock doc and especially if you're able to watch it in a cinema, you do get a good sense of the massive scale of Knebworth. The director makes the good decision to focus on some individual fans (some more interesting than others) and their stories before moving out to show the wider scale of the festival. Liam's helicopter entrance is fun even if perhaps a tad overdone. The songs aren't presented in full; they seem to be truncated, I suppose for the obvious reason to keep the doc to a reasonable length, although some full versions would have been nice.Overall, pretty cool but could have been better for obvious reasons.",False
2,9,It's a TWO part Doc & Concert,dtnmusic,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some dont understand this is a 2 part deal: Part A is the documentary section with interviews and the interest surrounding Liam returning to Knebworth 26 years later. Part B is the ENTIRE concert in order, which includes 7 of his new gens and 9 Oasis classics. You have to find the right version, you may find only the doc, only the concert, or The Series containing both. This collection is well done and high budget. The packed Knebworth crowd is energetic, immensely happy, and just as important as Liam and the band. And on that topic, the band is HUGE and amazing and gels perfect with Liam. Backup singers are class. Don't knock my review but I personally feel Liam with this band and show is perfection. Cheers!",False
3,4,Zzzz,bozmeister,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLiam you are one of hero's In life but honest bud this is painfully dull.A load of 20 and 30 year olds who are jumping on the oasis band wagon. The first hour are kids in their bedrooms showing off their posters in Halifax, honestly.I put it on hoping to see the gig. Was there of course in 96, as well as another dozen or so oasis events.Noel must be laughing justifying why hes not involved.The other pieces I didn't like is why is the 80s believed to be such a bad political time? It wasn't. The 80s and 90s were both great times in my life so educating anyone younger than 35 to think it was terrible is just wrong. Why who Blair or Thatcher? Its a music documentary
Sadly turned it off after 20 minutes because it was so boring.Liam please bring the good days back rather than listening to the new fans. Some of us in our 40s and 50s were with you at the beginning and will be there to the end. But this is nonsense mate. Its desperate.",True

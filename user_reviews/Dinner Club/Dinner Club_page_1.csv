1,9,A Must See,Italianreviewer,n/a,17/08/2025,"A clever new format. Partly a food-contest, partly a sit-com, and somehow a documentary.It shows the beauty of some gems-tourist destinations in beautiful Italy, showing amazing traditional food, great cooking skills all in a very pleasant format with great actors and a great chef (formerly unpleasant and full of arrogance in previous Tvshows, now showing on top of knowledge and skills also kindness, human touch and irony).This show it's one of a kind.I hope it will be continued, and it's replicable everywhere, as long as tourist locations, food tradition are important.Chefs and actors ... are available all ove the world.",False
2,10,Can't live without it,flevizzani,n/a,17/08/2025,"I have just seen the first two episodes and I am already addicted to it.A journey to discover Italy and some corners of the Stivale, a trip to discover its ""humanity"" (meaning the strangest and most curious population), a road movie to discover its less known but more particular foods.Passengers of this trip are famous actors, that make me laugh on the floor!Half food reality show, half sitcom, it is a 100% must-see!",False
3,9,"Deeper, more involved than Tucci, and just as delicious!",nursermk,n/a,17/08/2025,"Wonderful to watch, great soundtrack, delicious food and gorgeous travel through land and sea of Italia.. . Whether or not you are Paisan, you will get pulled into each episode and be treated to a front row seat on this grand adventure. The subtitles will help you pick up a few words and phrases along the way but these few episodes are a great way to get out and explore without leaving the house! Bravissimo!",False

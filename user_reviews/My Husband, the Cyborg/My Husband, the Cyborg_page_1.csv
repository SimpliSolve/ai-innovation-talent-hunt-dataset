1,6,A sad relationship,igorsb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is actually about unhealthy relationship and its dynamics. That silly device that beeps when Scott turns north is the least problem Susanna have. It was quite unpleasant experience getting to know Scott through this film, self absorbed, emotionally unavailable, probably a narcissist. Almost from the first minute of the film I got that feeling, what is she doing with him - seems there is no chemistry or enough respect. Maybe Susanna is also not perfect but her sarcastic comments are probably just a reaction to his constan belittling her. The most surprising thing is they stayed together although a viewer can not see a visible glue that keeps them together.",False
2,6,These people suck,machi712-835-648661,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is kind of infuriating. It does make me feel something and keep watching though, so that's to its credit, and I recommend it but have lots of things to say.The film making itself is amateurish, but that gives it some charm. It feels like a real authentic window into this couple's lives. There is one annoying song that repeats over and over when the documentarian is reading quotes, but other than that the editing is good and keeps things moving along.This film gave me a strange feeling like I was watching something about the future but rooted firmly in the artistic sensibilities of the past. Like I was watching people from the 60's forging ahead into their imagined future.Now for my critiques not about the film really but about the people in it. Both of them are kind of terrible.Scott seems incapable of empathy and seeing anything from anyone's perspective but his own. Also, any time his wife makes an effort to explore his interests and move in a similar direction in order to support him, he only gives her criticism and ridicule.Susanna has some understandable confusion and resentment due to Scott's obsession with North. But instead of processing it and communicating it healthfully, she takes it out on Scott with sarcasm, cutting remarks, and even intentionally causing him physical pain on many occasions.These people either need help or deserve each other-or both.Also, North Sense is pretty stupid, at least in its current iterations. I can't see any reason to implant something into your body for this tech, especially given how much physical pain and discomfort it causes Scott. Why not just tape it on at this point if you want it attached to your body? The final iteration shown in the credits seems even dumber, as it requires you to inject a little vial into your chest, then wear a big clunky necklace over it. Why not just wear the necklace and not inject anything at all?",True
3,2,"My Husband, the Porksword",wakster,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis guy is a complete jerk, installing useless tech into his body that has no practical use at all. I sometimes think people have too much cash and hit a point where they run out of things to buy and you end up with with a Vibrating North detector in your chest. I was expecting super human hearing, bionic limbs but no a ""I'm pointing north"" detector.The his wife gets a magnet implanted into her finger and he's upset about it. Please for the love of God get a brain transplant and hopefully that'll be the end of this nonsense. He's no more a cyborg than a dude with a pacemaker and you don't hear them going on about it.",True
4,10,Thought Provoking and Intimate,imdbfan-5347372878,n/a,16/08/2025,It got me thinking about the nuances of relationship; how we relate to one another as partners and friends and family and to wider cultural movements and traditions. It makes you think about the ways technology can help us connect and grow and how it can fragment us.I really loved it. Impactful film making. It's stayed with me. It's an intimate document of a moment in the lives of a husband and a wife as they navigate change. The husband in this story is exploring what it means to blend technology into his body and become a cyborg.In a way we're all facing a similar question in our own lives. How do we live with technology in ways that bring us closer not drive us apart?Beautiful animations also A treat of a film.,False

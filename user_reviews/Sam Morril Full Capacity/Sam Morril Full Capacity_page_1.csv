1,10,Awesome!!,ktholl-81076,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great sneak peak into the ""inside baseball"" of comedy... specifically in regards to new york comics reeling from the shell shock that the pandemic forced upon all of us. It puts into perspective how covid became the great equalizer for everyone in the world, not just as American citizens, but as human beings. Whether it be interviews with the older generation of NY Comics, the newer generation, (special mention to Taylor Tomlinson, a great comic from LA), or the clips of actual stand up sets... Despite any personal inclinations, there is sure to be something for everyone to ""tickle their funny bone"".",False

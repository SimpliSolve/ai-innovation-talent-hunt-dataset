1,10,made in the...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerName, mood, culture,spirits and the pace that you may expect from neworleanans. And after 6 episodes into the first season( i hope theyll make a lot of seasons , allthough im not asking formore murders and major crimes) i'm very pleased to acclaim that A6E productions , have done it again...a decent spin off of ''the first 48 '', in which weve seen alot of work done by the new orleans police department, which is a great pleasure because i, a grumpy old norwegian, being a true crime television nerd, feel like ive known them detectives all my life...so if you are new to the genre, then watch it, cause theyve sprinkled some bourbon , kreolian spice and jazzed it up, just to give you the great settings of the proud city built on a former ditch of quagmire at the banks of the mighty ,, old man river''.",True
2,9,The other side of The First 48.,avnrulz,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the other side of the First 48, and if you've watched that program, you'll see some familiar faces from NOPD, and new faces, working to resolve homicide cases. It's done with the same combination of crime scene canvassing, witness interviews, reviewing available video, and compiling a case, but without the clock ticking down in the corner. The cases take as long as they take, and sometimes they're resolved, sometimes they aren't. The hardest part is watching witnesses refuse to cooperate, yet they then tell the police they want them to solve the crime. The best episodes are the ones which do have a resolution, but, it is a real-time, real-life program.",False
3,7,"3 for entertaining value, 10 for educational",vladimirsvetlov-95558,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolute must watch if you want to see real provincial police at work. Scripted TV shows like Law&Order (especially Law&Order UK) give the audience the unrealistically cerebral view of the work detectives do to solve crimes. Homicide Squad NO is there to set the record straight - unbothered detectives blundering from crime scene to watching CCTV, to guessing the identity of the perp, to realizing they guessed wrong, to watching more TV... The mixture of indifference and incompetence gets old pretty quick, but you've got to watch this whole thang, to inoculate yourself against unrealistic expectations.And yeah, when these detectives tell you they are ""cooking with gasoline"" or ""or cooking with grease"" (quotes), take it on face value...",False

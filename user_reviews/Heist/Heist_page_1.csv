1,7,"Decent, light hearted, dramatized documentary about huge and/or ridiculous heists",garnet-suss,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ignore the super low reviews. This documentary does not pretend to be serious and dramatic. The stories are told, first hand, by those who pulled them off, and they put a decent amount of money and effort into the dramatizations.It's interesting, light hearted and fun.",False
2,7,Cringe and Binge On This Mini-Series of Left-Field Criminals,AudioFileZ,n/a,15/08/2025,"The mini-series ""Heist"" thankfully wasn't about some gang of bank-robbers as seen on The FBI Files. It was, at least to me, an interesting look at obscure yet rather sensational solved robberies. More satisfying as such than those big crimes like The Gardner Museum art theft that will likely never be resolved.Interviews with the actual perpetrators, as well as various law enforcement officials, increases the drama. The three stories here are wildly different in nature helping to create a compact series perfect for a binge-watch. This is done with the twist of dark comedy, but it is clear behind everything the cost was high casuing dire consequences. Recommended for true crime fans.",False
3,6,Two out of three are good,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerThe first two stories were good. But the Netflix producers tried to stylize the last story too much into an Ocean Eleven sequel. I found the styling of the last story annoying. It felt like a two episode marketing infomercial for Kentucky bourbons.,True
4,6,Torn,roondogbb,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love true crime documentaries and Netflix does churn out a number of them every year. However the quality ranges from very high to simply poor. With the highlight of this year for me being Sophie a murder in west cork, to the bad, Sons of Sam.... What makes a documentary good in my opinion? For it to feel compelling and captivating without the necesity to over dramatize everything. This series of 6 episodes is made up of 3 two part stories.... The first story is about the heist of money truck, the second is about the heist of money from a airport warehouse and the third and perhaps the weakest..... the theft of bourbon.... all these stories have dramatized recreations of what happened. (perhaps to put something on the screen) while people were being interviewed about their experiences of planning the crimes they commited and how they escaped and eventually got caught etc.The recreations sadly reminded me of sometimes cheesy overdramatized exagerated ww2 documentaries...... instead of keeping things simple, perhaps with just nice cinematography and cutting the length from 2 hours one.... it could have been better. Also big negative was that the people being ""interviewed"" were at times acctresses, a big no no.... if you can't get the people have a voice over person or something more traditional. It felt deceptiveSophie a murder in west cork on the contrary was more simple, It didn't insist on the use of recreations, but rather capture the beautiful scenary of the area and interweave it with interviews etc.So im going to have to give it a six because its watchable, albeit not a great watch.",False
5,7,Dramatic romantic creepy sad corny and down-right funny,RedKidBytes,n/a,15/08/2025,"Probably these are the stories you have never heard about unless you have lived in the nearby towns.Not all characters are depicted necessarily as the bad guys but more likely of becoming who they are due to growing within the elements of their own surroundings. Basically people who trying to survive are not necessarily tugs.What makes the heist very interesting is that; ordinary people find themselves in extraordinary circumstances where the opportunity for steeling large sums of cash almost drops on their lap.It turns out that hiding in plain sight is much more difficult than the stealing itself, with massive consequences for themselves as well as for the people they love and cherish.A must watch!",False
6,7,Interesting stories,Calicodreamin,n/a,15/08/2025,"A unique and different take on true crime, the heist. The first two stories were well told and the documentaries well made. Didn't care for the bourbon one. Overall though, well made episodes that were interesting to watch.",False
7,9,Great true crime series,Erkki78,n/a,15/08/2025,Watched all episodes today and I'm a big fan of true crime shows and documentaries. This was very well done and little bit different than usually. Very good all and all series. Highly recommend.,False
8,10,A Documentary That Isn't Boring!,makaylapark,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love watching documentaries, but it's like pulling teeth to get my fianc√© to watch any with me. I begged her, after watching the first story myself to give it a shot. Turned out that everyone in the house loved it! We finished the whole series in a day. This documentary series has amazing cinematography with complex interviews, compelling scenes, and fantastic graphics. It takes a lot for me to sit down and watch TV all day, especially on a Saturday. However, this series had me hooked for a little over 4 straight hours and leaving me wishing there was more. Those who are giving this show a negative review either don't like seeing new concepts for documentaries, or they don't appreciate established work. Either way, this series is awesome and I can't wait for season 2!",False
9,10,A great series,spandydhadse,n/a,15/08/2025,Must watch heist life series probably best heist documentaries on Netflix.......,False
10,5,It's to be sympathetic,holliowsley,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's really hard to watch the interviews when none of them had true remorse for what they did.The worst was the PappyGate episode. Blaming the sheriff for ""making a big deal out of it"" and ""it was only whiskey, he didn't kill nobody."" Honestly, the only people I felt bad for were his kids. Not only did he put them through that horrendous experience, now he emotionally manipulates them into validating his existence. Gross.",True
11,9,Exciting and a popcorn watch,moonvijh,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am not sure what other reviewers are talking about, but I really enjoyed the dramitisation touch of series. Showing the history, building upto heist and then aftermath of events. It always kept you edge and wanting to hear more about the story.Just because it's Netflix and you are not getting Discovery channel documentaries doesn't mean it's bad. It's engaging, exciting and a great watch.",False
12,9,Such a good watch,discokate,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yeah its stylised, but very entertaining and different. Season 2 pls üôè",False
13,10,Enjoyed all 3 stories...ignore the negative reviews and see for yourself,ECGisME,n/a,15/08/2025,"I feel compelled to give a review after seeing all the overly critical reviews about this docuseries. I enjoyed all three stories. I thought they were laid out well and the reenactment acting was good. I wasn't looking for Oscar-worthy performances, just believable. I don't think it does the crimes a disservice by showing humanity towards these people. They are paying on many levels, I'm sure. I don't think it's cheaply done either. It's unnecessary for crime stories to always have a dark and somber mode, like most do. The lighter attitude helps it not affect you in a depressing way. It didn't exactly sway me to pity any of them, but it shows the reality of the struggles humans face with temptation when life isn't going so great. All of them suffered consequences. You'll likely get caught in this day and age so the moral is to take the high road. In the meantime, I'd love to see more Heist stories in the future.",False
14,1,Not a documentary series.,dan_kot,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't know why Netflix would choose to take an interesting and compelling subject matter and turn it into an over-dramatized, over-stylized, low-rent Tarantino knock-off. I forced myself to make it through the first story then realized I was just wasting my time. Reading about the individual stories is far more interesting than suffering through this dreck.",False
15,9,Hungry for More!,annapierc,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'll start out with what most true crime lover's will comment on: the reenactments. I think, when done well, they add an extra layer to the story-telling and create more excitement when watching. Unlike most Discovery channel reenactments, Netflix did an incredible job. My only qualm was that it could be a bit confusing as to which actor was which real-life person, as they were depicting younger versions of those individuals.Otherwise, I think the series was very well done. Each story received two episodes -- giving you just enough detail to feel like you got the whole story, while not feeling like they were dragging on to create more content. I've seen other reviews suggest that this series ""glamorizes"" crimes, but at the end of each story there is a bit of ""call to action"" to the viewer. The subjects discuss how it's not worth it, but then ask the hard questions of ""what would you do in my situation?"" It's interesting to ask yourself when the show wraps.Overall, the series is well done and I'm glad Netflix is continually investing in their true crime genre. If you're considering giving it a watch, go ahead and dive in! It's bite-sized and better than most of the content that's out there right now.",False
16,8,"Light hearted, dramatised documentary",ggwtgjkp,n/a,15/08/2025,I watched this series in 3 sittings and enjoyed it immensely. It is light and refreshingly honest. The interviewees are interesting and often funny. It is realistic and doesn't sugarcoat or mythologise the crimes. I hope there's another series.,False
17,9,Really good series,vivoconnor1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Really liked this series. Well put together on 3 heists told, mainly, from perpetrators view point but the law always got their men/women.",False
18,2,Dumb people doing dumb things.,nigelmacdonald-97173,n/a,15/08/2025,Some obnoxious and stupid people commit crimes and ruin lives including their own.,False
19,10,I don't know why there are negative reviews,pretzeltopper,n/a,15/08/2025,This show is really good. It's so cool watching how everything went down and it's all true. Really action packed incredibly well done hope it has another season!,False
20,8,What I Saw was cool!,ametallicaman1989,n/a,15/08/2025,"To start off I only watched the Pappy gate episodes of this show. As a bourbon fan from Kentucky it was the only one that interested me. Some of the ""scenes"" and ""acting"" portions a little cheesey. But the overall story and what happened is very interesting. Hearing it from the man himself makes it keep your attention. I cant speak to the other heist stories and episodes, but this one is worth the watch.",False
21,4,Mixed Feelings,bbap-41754,n/a,15/08/2025,"After enjoying 4 episodes, the 5th & 6th crime regarding the Kentucky guys was awful. The guy had no remorse as the others did, he was so full of himself it was pathetic, so nasty, big bragger, still so full of himself.",False
22,1,A Heist of Your Time,mjhzzz,n/a,15/08/2025,"Same old stuff. Not a documentary. If based on true facts, lots of drama unnecessarily added. Maybe watch while you're busy doing something else. So many shows like this one & not unique. Episodes 1&2 best, 3&4 good, 5&6 not do good.",False
23,3,Dull dull dull ZZZzzzzz,pompey2310,n/a,15/08/2025,"Another Netflix cure for insomnia. Way too much waffle and inane monologues from supposedly interesting people, that are in fact life's dregs. As for the comically bad re-enactments, sorry this is a spectacular waste of effort, time and production costs.",False
24,1,Another cheaply made sad and disappointing documentary from Netflix,cdeanroane,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIs this offering from Netflix will deal with 3 crimes and each is told in two parts so six episodes. Each episode actual time is about 45 mins. In the time it takes to watch just one episode you could do an quick internet search will you learn more then was revealed in both episodes as told by Netflix. You will also be spared the bad acting and horrid music that is added. As I write this there are 3 other review and I can not see how 2 out of the 3 watched the same show.The first crime is. Roberto Solis who was convicted of robbery and murder and sentenced to life behind bars. However while in prison he wrote some poetry which got some some good press and he was granted parole! He encounters Heather Tallchief who is out of work due to a crack cocaine habit. They settle in Las Vegas where she gets a job driving an armored car. When Roberto starts making plans to rob the company with Heather's help. In October of 1993 their robber of 3 million dollars happens. We hear this from Heather's side only. Like most Netflix documentaries they pulled in her coworkers who think it was funny how this happened. The actress who pretending to be Tallchief is overly giddy or stoned or perhaps both I am not sure. You are given interviews of agents who worked the case and some may then wonders how they even got a job in law enforcement. After the robbery the pair ended up living in Amsterdam where she gets pregnant and after giving birth decides she no longer wants to be with Roberto. After 12 years she makes arrangements to turn herself in back in Las Vegas. While Roberto is still at large. Heather gets off fairly light since she turned herself in and blamed Roberto for leading her into a life of crime. She was later sentenced to sixty-three months in prison and in June 2010, she was released on parole. The last shots are of the real Heather with her face obscured who Roberto is now dead in case he is not she says please not to let him know where she is. Well I can say to that is why is putting this out on Netflix where it will he aired around the world. I guess she will blame Netflix if Roberto finds her like she blamed Roberto for her being an outlaw.The second set is.called the The Money Plane about Karls Monzon who assembled a crew family and friends who are Cuban Refugees and planed a heist at the Miami International Airport using ideas he got by studying TV shows. Once again Netflix has one main speaker not speaking English last month same was done another documentary about a French woman who was had a home in Ireland was killed there. A good portion of the show was French with no onscreen translation or dubbed in to English. This time it is Spanish that it spoken so any thing said by Karls Monzon says was in Spanish with no onscreen translation or dubbed in English. Lets just says watching TV shows might have inspired Karls Monzon to plan and do his robbery, however like in most TV shows in the end crooks are all caught. Of the 7 million dollars that was stolen only about 1.5 million was recovered.The third set is called The Bourbon King about Toby Curtsinger who enlists his pals in a scheme to steal the world's most expensive bourbon Pappy Van Winkle. This tale is told in a good ol' boy way since it took place in Kentucky. The music used in this set makes it almost impossible to watch. There was no actual money stolen just the bourbon. Which in itself was of a great value. However Toby now is local legend now and many say thanks to him the bourbon is worth even more now cause of the coverage it got!I will say if you like good true crime shows avoid things on Netflix and stick to Investigation. Discovery or Oxygen. Also the UK has really good shows about true crime even better them many scripted TV show about crime such those by Dick Wolf. Far superior shows on all levels then things on Netflix which are geared to those who are less then 25 years in age.",True
25,3,I'm in 10 minutes!,TruthbeTold2626,n/a,15/08/2025,This is garbage! Come on Netflix! Over dramatized nonsense. Feels like a new unsolved mysteries episode without any of the quality. Pass this hunk of junk by.,False

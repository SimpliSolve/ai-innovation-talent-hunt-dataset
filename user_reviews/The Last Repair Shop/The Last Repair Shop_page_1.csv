1,8,A Musical Journey Through the Past,canalcinetrama,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Last Repair Shop"" is a poem in prose, a hymn to memory and resistance against the tyranny of disposability. It is an invitation to celebrate the beauty of what was created with love, to listen to the stories that old objects have to tell.At the end of the journey, we are touched by a sweet melancholy and a deep gratitude. Melancholy for the loss of a world where objects were valued and repaired, and gratitude for finding, amidst the fast pace of modern life, a haven where time slows down and memory finds shelter.May this film inspire in each of us a passion for preservation, respect for the past, and the search for beauty in simple things. May we all be guardians of time, restoring not only objects, but also the memories that reside within them.",False
2,8,So much more than the title,kmcmac,n/a,15/08/2025,"Far too short as it hardly touches on the actual repairs, instrument ones that is. That could have been technically interesting, but this is a story of how music and the provision of the instruments, often to those too poor to afford them can change or be a new start in their young lives. This is brought into focus by the same effects that music had on the repair staff themselves, as they each recount the difficulties and for some the deep emtional trauma that they still carry. For one of whom, reminded me of the stories told and witnessed by Jewish families, with the same lasting bewilderment of how, why then their lives changed in an instant., what it was is no longer.",False
3,7,The many stories,isaacsundaralingam,n/a,15/08/2025,"Every once in a while, you need a movie like Kris Bowers & Ben Proudfoot's ""The Last Repair Shop"" to make you feel good about the world we live in. It's a reminder of the many stories we all have of ourselves that eventually shape us to be who we are and how these stories can go on to make an impact on the lives of those we wouldn't even know.With some crisp and striking cinematography, and an array of stories; each interesting and each heartfelt, the movie documents the people behind the only remaining repair shop that fixes musical instruments for its public school students at no cost. Contributing to the dreams of more than 80,000 students, and now inspiring an audience with their passion for what they do, the craftsmen at ""The Last Repair Shop"" make this documentary short film one of the year's finest.",False
4,10,Unmasking Reality: A Heartfelt Journey Through 'The Last Repair Shop,varedi-48985,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a movie I saw after a very long time that had a story about human lives.It depicted the mass murder of innocent people in Armenia, the 'American dream', and the reality behind it.It also portrayed a simple request of a child which, if ignored, could have probably led him down a very different path.The story of people loving each other, and the love which is passed on to others, was beautifully presented.This was a beautiful movie. I wish other filmmakers could understand what a movie means, learn from this, and make more of these.Humans can be saved if they see what they can do to make a difference and should understand the lies around us. Simple movies like this can raise a lot of questions that were never asked before. I loved the movie. Thank you!",False
5,10,"wATCH it! Brilliant, human & wonderfully moving.",icaremore,n/a,15/08/2025,"I cannot stress enough the value of watching this moving Documentary. As another user said, ""not nearly long enough."" It left me wanting more for sure- is a good way. Wonderfully written, shot, & edited. And the sound! Using the kids in the score recording was genius. You will not be sorry you spent the time. The experience helps remind you people have stories and are worth spending the time to listen & learn about. Music is such an important part of our lives. In so many unique and various ways sound touches us all. Whether you play or just listen- even if you play for your own pleasure or professionally, or casually listen or you're a diehard hard fan, music moves you.",False
6,n/a,four people,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is a film as useful kick to hope. Maybe, in some measure, to forms of joy.Four people, fixing musical instruments of students, offer their stories.Few young musicians confesse their strong connection with their instrument.In Los Angeles , a repair shop, maybe the last, offering, from 1959, the support for good fonction of musical instruments.Not the story itself is real significant, but the state inspired by the words of this people. Because it is a sort of return to the comfort of survive, in almost brave manner, of a stable old world , defined by dedication and by passion and personal dramas and careful gestures and empathy.Beautiful documentary, no doubts. But, first, profound useful.",False
7,7,The Last Repair Shop,CinemaSerf,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is quite an engaging documentary that introduces us to four specialist technicians who maintain some of the musical instruments that are provided free to pupils in the Los Angeles school system. Prefaced by a few words from each of the children who benefit from the violins, tubas, pianos and saxophones to name but a few, we then meet four of the people - from a variety of interesting, sometimes quite traumatic, backgrounds - as they show us just how meticulously they work to keep these instruments alive and useful. To be honest, I could have been doing with just a little more performance from the would-be students, but these characters who put their heart and soul into preserving these musical tools come across as dedicated and passionate. The same can be said for the students - especially the young violinist at the start whose smile just about says it all. We end with a rousing section from the alumni of students who have benefitted over the years and this is a fine testament to the role of music in an education system that doesn't just focus on the academic.",False
8,10,A Heartfelt Ode to Resilience and Harmony,kr-45859,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""The Last Repair Shop"" is a poignant documentary that intricately weaves together the threads of history, music, and human resilience, creating a harmonious narrative that resonates deeply with viewers. Directed by Ben Proudfoot and Kris Bowers, this Oscar-nominated short film invites audiences into the captivating world of a Los Angeles-based repair shop, where the mending of musical instruments becomes a transformative force for individuals and their communities.At its core, the documentary unfolds as a tribute to the tireless efforts of four unsung heroes who work diligently to ensure that no student is deprived of the joy of music. The repair technicians, portrayed with sincerity and passion, showcase an unwavering commitment to preserving not just instruments but the dreams and potential of countless children. Their stories are interwoven with the tales of young musicians, often from immigrant or non-white families, whose lives are touched by the reparative magic of the shop.The film's success lies in its ability to transcend the mundane and elevate the seemingly routine act of instrument repair into a powerful metaphor for hope, resilience, and the universal language of music. The exploration of historical struggles and violence, coupled with personal narratives from immigrant families seeking the 'American Dream,' adds layers of depth and relatability to the documentary.One of the documentary's strengths is its emphasis on inclusivity, highlighting the impact of music on those who often find themselves marginalized in underfunded public schools. The narrative beautifully captures the transformative potential of music in offering discipline, personal growth, and a pathway to a brighter future for children who may otherwise be overlooked.The cinematography, though occasionally drifting, captures the essence of each interviewee's story with warmth and sensitivity.

The stories shared by the repair technicians and the young musicians are moving testaments to the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of art.In conclusion, ""The Last Repair Shop"" stands as a beacon of hope and a celebration of the beauty found in simple things.

9,10,Beautiful and very delicate,isahakyan,n/a,15/08/2025,"A lovely documentary!A simple concept, but done with so much care.A fantastic camera work, brilliant editing, beautiful use of music and sound design.Love the delicacy with which the stories of people are told. Heavy subjects are touched through great interviews and minimum archival footage. So many emotions - from smiles to tears.The ending credits are done so creatively.Through documenting the repair shop the film tells a story of a whole society. And the importance of art for healing the same society.A very professional short documentary that I would recommend everyone to watch.",False
10,8,Deeply moving and uplifiting,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""The Last Repair Shop"" (2023 release; 39 min.) opens, the opening credits reminds us that Los Angeles is one of the last cities providing repaired instruments for free to its public students, who are more likely than not minorities. We are then introduced to a a young Black girl as she speaks into the camera: ""I love the violin!"", and she tells her story how she became enamored with the violin. In a parallel story, we are introduced to a guy whose is responsible for fixing string instruments like the violin. At this point we are 5 minutes into the film.Couple of comments: ""The Last Repair Shop"" profiles 4 students and 4 repair people. Each and every single one of them has a deeply human and moving story as to their background and how they ended up taking up an instrument or repairing these instruments. This short documentary demonstrates the power of storytelling. No social effects needed! The film itself is carefully crafted. I was in particular impressed by the score that is featured, itself a marvel of classical music. I must admit that when the end credits started rolling, I was emotionally not ready to say goodbye to these people and their incredible soties.""The Last Repair Shop"" earned a well-deserved Short Documentary Oscar nomination. I was not familiar with the film at all, until I saw a ""For Your Consideration"" ad for it in the Sunday New York Times this weekend. The ad mentioned that this is now streaming on Hulu, and I immediately decided to check it out. So glad I did. If you are in the mood for a deeply moving and uplifting movie experience that will remind us of the value of the arts in our schools and communities, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
11,4,The thinnest red thread,mickeythechamp,n/a,15/08/2025,"Road to the Oscars, 2024. This movie is nominated for 1 award, and it's documentary short.The Last Repair shop is of course gripping and heartwarming. A little slice of life documentary about human connection and life, or alt least that's what it wants to be. A seemingly normal backdrop that would make sense for the documentary kind of falls apart when half the stories don't really make much sense in the same doc, and trying to make a red thread where there is barely one. This is still a good enough watch, but more than a collection of stories it's not.We hear about a repair shop for instruments. The people that use it and the people behind making instruments.This is a documentary about human connections and how we as people can feel connected through something even if we don't think about it. How repair people think of us and thinks about our beloved possessions. Sadly the documentary don't really but much focus into this, rather than telling the stories of the repair shops members, that barely have something to do with must or connection half the time, and it just turns into 4 interviews with some kids cut in between to try to make a loosely red thread you really are forcing into the doc.The stories told are interesting and enjoyable, but in the end it ends up being nothing but 4 people highlighting their lives and nothing more. They are all nice people and doing great work, but the documentary really needed to focus more on maybe the repairing, or the people that get their instruments repaired to make the doc make fully sense, since it ends up meaning not much by the end.The score was pretty good, which is to be expected from a doc about instruments. The music also works great with the stories told.I ended up liking what I saw, but never really connected or found it profoundly important to tell. It's interesting enough and fun to hear about people and a place like this, but in the end it's something I quickly shrug off as nothing more than a short doc in a sea of them.Oscar Predictions:
I have seen 3 of the 4 nominated short documentaries and I can say now that this might have a chance, purely for being a Disney produced one. I would rather have the others I saw win, Island In Between (2023) and The Barber of Little Rock (2023) as their subject matter feels more important to tell than this. While this isn't bad, it's just not a movie you sit back and really think about.",False
12,9,MAGNIFICENT,jmvscotland,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm sometimes amazed at the movies that win top awards at the Oscars each year. I'm thinking here, for example, of ""Birdman"" and ""The Shape Of Water"", both of which I thought were terrible, a view evidently shared by many others.But, in fairness to the Academy, sometimes they get it just so right. And here, with ""The Last Repair Shop"", we have the very best example. My wife and I watched it last night, just a few days after the 2024 Oscars were awarded, and we were just blown away by the quality of this short documentary.The several people who work in the instrument repair shop should touch everyone's heart. They are just the best people in the world and rightly deserve to be honoured here in this magnificent short film. The personal stories of their life struggles are inspiring and touching, as is their dedication to the work that they very obviously love.This film is one that I could easily watch again and again. Any time I might be feeling low or when the modern world just seems too insane and overwhelming.8.5 from me. Fantastic.JMVSCOTLAND.",False
13,9,Touching and humanistic,MehdiTaba,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's a powerful and emotional short documentary from Ben Proudfoot and Kris Bowers.They nailed it. The emotional and humanistic impact of this documentary is beyond words. It's absolutely touching and humanistic.There are so many elements to its core values. The Last Repair Shop is about music, broken musical instruments and the way that they can be easily fixed and have an impact on someone's life, the people who work on that shop and fix the instruments for years and how this friendly shop helped them without any segregation and inequality.Through the stories they share, we can find so many different layers to the United States issues and the way the people are trying to cope with situation, mostly with the help of music or a job that provides them some security and stability.Musically, Katya Richardson and Kris Bowers done a superb job. Every note was written with a lot of care and passion. The ending credits was just mind-blowing and was emotionally like something that you rarely experience.I don't think that I saw anything as strong as The Last Repair Shop in 2023!8.5/10.",True
14,10,A movie telling so much in such minimal expression,YukoK,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was 1971 when the elementary school I was attending in Pasadena, LA County, started afterschool violin classes. Friends told me the teacher was mean, but I started seeing EVERYBODY carrying instruments.I could understand that, because the quality of regular music classes at school was poor to say the least (along with science and PE). All we did was listen to records. No one really taught us to sing, moreover to play instruments. And that was LA.A great number of classmates were Mexicans. There might be two Chinese per school, one Korean and one Japanese. Vietnamese, Cambodians and Armenians would come much later, for the obvious reasons.The world today is a mess. We don't have money. What can a poor boy do (except to play in a rock'n'roll band)? Every time I ask myself those questions, I'm going to remember this movie and do what an ordinary person can do - repair.",False
15,10,You deserve this joyful movie,dolive-578-564987,n/a,15/08/2025,"Please watch this movie. You will feel better. We see kids and adults making each others' lives brighter. We see a school system, a large organization, that works when so many systems seem not to. There is an undercurrent throughout of adversity being overcome. And we see and hear, at the end of the movie, one of the most beautiful orchestral performances in the history of film. Technically, the stories of the students and the heroes who repair their instruments with loving care, the cinematography and the editing - all these technical achievements are at their best here. But the gut reaction matters most - do I feel better after watching this? Yes, you feel a calmness, a sense of life as it should and can be. You feel happier, more ready to believe that despite problems, this can be a wonderful world.",False
16,5,Mostly terrible,johnnmark,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can't help but wonder if the person who made this documentary has ever seen another documentary in their life. Same goes for those who chose to nominate it for an Academy Award. It is so full of BS cliché that it could pass for an Onion parody. So much for a documentary: a bunch of archival footage, some B-roll, and music at the end, all set to a few boring interviews about some people's lives, the likes of which I could do in the next 45 seconds with my dad, my uncle or the next door neighbor, without any skill. There is a bracket of about 7 minutes that is somewhat interesting and the cinematography is not terrible, but the rest is below unwatchable. There is NO insight into anything to do with the instruments, just a few generalized boring comments I could have made myself to myself while watching. The backstories are irrelevant or at least not made to seem relevant in any way to the theme stated at the beginning, which is that these people are left among the few doing what they are doing. There is nothing about what it is for them to be ""the last repair shop"" or thereabout. The first guy is gay and good for him but what does that have to do with repairing the instruments. The second lady is an immigrant who had a tough life and no money, which is a story half the people I know and about a quarter of the videos on YouTube have to say so what's the interesting take? And the bald guy seems to have had a fascinating life but he never bothers to tell us how the he*l he got from opening for Elvis Presley to fixing instruments for kids. Just don't bother to watch this, you can find dozens of better YouTube videos about any of the subjects mentioned in the film.",False

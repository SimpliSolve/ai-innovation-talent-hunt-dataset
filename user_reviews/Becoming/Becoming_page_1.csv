1,8,I don't get the reviews!,fiorelalazaro-65738,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a huge fan of Michelle Obama and I deeply appreciated the ""slow"" (perhaps even ""serene""?) pace of the film, which revealed an even more authentic image of the former First Lady. It could seem like a bunch of tour snippets seen together and maybe it is, but I didn't hate it. The film complements and supplements her bestseller very well, and I do think some background knowledge on Mrs Obama could help viewers connect more with the movie and the stories but personally my eyes were brimming with tears the whole way through. If I had anything else to say, I would probably have enjoyed more of those segments that gave a little glimpse into the lives of the young readers/followers of Michelle Obama.",False
2,8,First first Lady,ks-60500,n/a,16/08/2025,Michelle is one of the most well known and heartful First Lady ever in history. Attitude matters change every aspects in life. We are grateful to have her for 8 years and she did make the whole world in better place. Feel ashamed the one now truely.,False
3,8,Still love Michelle Obama,tay-sedai,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a foreigner watching on in 2008, I was stunned that America had done this thing. Like many, I hadn't thought it would ever happen, or at least not for many more years. I was also extremely proud of the nation for the choice they made (unlike 8 years later). But you know one thought I had almost right away? ""Oh God, I hope he doesn't get assassinated."" Because I'm not naive about racism and extremism in America.Watching this documentary gave me more insight into the person Michelle was before becoming First Lady. She came from such a great family so it's easy to see why she aimed so high with confidence. I could also see a little hint of how difficult it must have been, not just after the election but in the lead up to it with all the hatred directed towards her in the media. You could see on her face that she was feeling the pressure, and justifiably anger too, even while she stayed quiet, knowing that speaking her mind was detrimental to the campaign (for no good reason either).I've always known that she was relieved to be leaving the White House, but this documentary gave me a better understanding of why that was. The Obama administration wasn't perfect, as I learned from watching Michael Moore's documentary about these years, including the story of Obama's visit to Flint, Michigan. I also knew that he was more of a deadly president to some Middle Eastern countries than even his predecessor, which I can't ever condone. Even so, watching this documentary made me pine for a time when the entire world didn't feel under threat because of the identity of the US leader.",False
4,n/a,Not a documentary but a promotion,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Didn't like it at all. This documentary feels like we are following a superstar and nothing less. It's all hyped up and it felt like I was watching a promotion. I expected something different and more classy.,False
5,6,"Not a documentary, it is an interview with Michelle",erhanipekciler,n/a,16/08/2025,That was on my list since months and yesterday finally I watched it. Michelle Obama looks funny person in real life and I really appreciate that she didn't lose herself with becoming first Lady. It must be really difficult. I watched it but not enlighten or I cannot say my life has changed. You can watch if you like Obama or if you want to kill time,False
6,7,A Rare Perspective,Jchakko,n/a,16/08/2025,I thought it was good. Michelle Obama sacrificed so much when she was catapulted into the First Lady. This film is important because even in 2020 its extremely rare to see the perspective of black women.,False
7,10,Vulnerable and inspiring,crowderhome,n/a,16/08/2025,"Open-hearted, vulnerable, genuine, honest, brave and inspiring. As a life-long evangelical Republican I was so surprised and captured by her transparent genuine faith, solid integrity, committed family values, and sacrificial commitment to serve with tender empathy and resolute strength. This documentary will be an inspiring reminder of America's better angels. Faith, hope and love inspiring.",False
8,7,Hugs and hugs,kevin c,n/a,16/08/2025,"Movie night with Iris.America's former first hugging lady gets glossy overview, from her own production company (shock). That said interesting topics are touched upon - marriage counselling, postnatal depression, her mum's favouring her brother? But it's fleeting and mostly light-hearted.So whilst it may not be insightful, it has buckets of emotional outpouring. You cannot not be moved when an elderly lady talks about the experience of seeing Obama's inauguration: ""I never thought I would see that. For that I thank you.""",False
9,9,Remember civility and intelligence?,adamsandel,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a very well done portrait of a genuinely inspiring woman. I pity the poor angry folks who were threatened by the Obamas then and are still venting their anger about a documentary that I guarantee they didn't watch.,False
10,6,A well-made companion to Michelle Obama's memoir of the same name,Sir_AmirSyarif,n/a,16/08/2025,"Though it feels more like a routine documentary of a megastar choosing to share her life with the public, 'Becoming' makes a warm, lovely, and well-made companion to Michelle Obama's memoir of the same name.",False
11,2,Superficial and shallow,MikeyB1793,n/a,16/08/2025,First off let me say that Michelle Obama is an independent and intelligent woman who had to overcome several obstacles in her life.But this documentary is simply hero worship and celebrity adoration.There are endless scenes of her with adoring fans and fawning interviewers.I became really tired of seeing people clapping and cheering at her presence.This could have been so much more. How did her role as first lady affect her as a parent? How did her world travels and meeting with many heads of state change her outlook?Sure there is a brief clip about how her daughters reacted to the White House.Which brings me to another aspect - this documentary spends maybe sixty seconds on one scene - and rapidly skips to the next - as if the viewer has a short attention span.There is no effort to engage beyond the superficial.,False
12,10,Michelle Obama is a powerhouse and at the same time just like you and me!,blpkst,n/a,16/08/2025,"The strength, intelligence, integrity, popularity and beauty of Michelle Obama cannot be minimized, she is a powerhouse. Whether you read her autobiography or didn't, if you are interested in hearing and seeing this formidable former First Lady as she truly is, this documentary does her justice. She is real, realistic, and inspiring. She cares so much about people of all ages and the next generation. I find her inspiring. I understood perfectly when some women and girls met her they were overwhelmed. She has that effect on those she meets because she sees them. How lucky we were to have her as our First Lady. At 56 years old, she is stunning. The Obamas, for eight wonderful years, moved the country forward. Michelle Obama is just as I hoped she would be, thoughtful, approachable, self-deprecating and fun.",False
13,7,Good movie good message,californiademocrats,n/a,16/08/2025,Love Michelle. Wish there was more to the story. Great regardless. Inspiring woman who has done so much for so many. Please watch this movie. I have to read her book now.,False
14,3,Nothing New If One Was Paying Attention,ecjenks,n/a,16/08/2025,"Where most documentaries go deep, this Netflix Obama produced Michelle Obama portrait stays at a pure surface portrayal. This ""Becoming"" is more about the former FLOTUS's inspirational personality, which was already laid out on display during the last 13 years of Michelle being in the public eye. So, in review - nothing new.",False
15,10,Very impressive woman,rcrystal-46135,n/a,16/08/2025,I really love how Michelle Obama wants to connect with young people and inspire them. Very nice to see people making the world a better place.This documentary doesn't talk politics. Seems people have a lot of anger in their being and triggered for reasons unknown.,False
16,10,Anyone who gives a NEGATIVE Review is...,nick-taylordr,n/a,16/08/2025,Already a HATER of the Obama's. Very clear and direct message of overcoming obstacles being above not beneath. It's obvious that any person who can not sit still and watch this documentary not only has the attention span of a 4 year old and clearly does not have any ability to think intellectually.,False
17,5,Quite boring,AlexandraMak,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Michelle. But this movies gives nothing new. It is just cuts form interview and couple of minutes of original interview. If you know at least something about Obamas, there is nothing new in this movie ... unfortunately.",False
18,10,Excellent in every way! What a woman.,strelczak,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is going to receive divided opinion mostly from the MAGA hat wearing Trump fan club, for this to have received 3.1 for only 7 reviews so far is evidence that we will get a skewed result.That said, there is absolutely no denying that Michelle deserves accolades for her achievements, she has been the role model for women in this world we all needed.She IS an incredible woman and would have made an exceptional running mate for Biden in the upcoming elections.She is proof that there could be a female President.",False
19,2,Boring. Watch if you are having trouble sleeping.,stanton-edward,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a lifelong Democrat, I expected this documentary to give us a glimpse into the life of the former first lady. Instead, I found it extremely boring and fell asleep half way through.",False
20,10,"Loved the book, loved this film",perfecthouse-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you more wonderful insight into our very missed family. Humor, class, and uplifting moments are throughout this film for everyone.",False
21,10,Excellent,mayammp,n/a,16/08/2025,"I haven't read the book yet, but I ordered it and can't wait to read it after watching this inspiring documentary. Michelle is such a force! So down to earth, compassionate and brilliant. Seeing all that she's accomplished amid so many adversities is beyond admirable. Boy, do I miss the Obama White House.",False
22,1,"""Becoming"" what?",lawnmorgan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nice lady, competent person. But, what a glassed over, romanticized view this is of the former First Lady. It is an apparent attempt to establish her for a ""Hillary-like"" future opportunity.
Didn't work for me on multiple levels",False
23,10,Amazing,dexdezi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing documentary on former first lady.
Don't miss to watch",False
24,2,Perhaps the biggest flop of the 21st Century,tonyross-47757,n/a,16/08/2025,I tried very hard to watch and enjoy this event. She struggles to put anything interesting in this film. Netflix no doubt wants a refund bigly,False
25,10,Well Made and Insightful,timtyler,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nice work, Nadia Hallgren.If this film wasn't tied to a book release it would be easier to appreciate. It's a bit of a fluff piece, however it's refreshing to get a glimpse of what appears to be an honest, behind-the-scenes looks at Michelle Obama's past and experience as First Lady of the United States.This film is well produced and deserves attention.",False

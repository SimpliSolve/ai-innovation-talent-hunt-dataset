2,9,Incredible Documentary,bohemianpirate-871-383487,n/a,15/08/2025,"Risen is fantastic. It's a must see for rap music fans and especially die hard ones.

4,10,Instant Classic Hip Hop Doc,daveh2332,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a documentary about rapper Hell Razah, one of hip-hop's greatest MCs with his uplifting, spiritual and religious angle, originally of Brooklyn's Red Hook group Sunz of Man, and one of the first originally signed to Wu-Tang's record label, who hasn't gotten yet his full spotlight, due to coming down with a brain aneurysm after his breakthrough solo album, Renaissance Child.I thought this film was very inspirational and educational starting from the birth of hip-hop and revealing its essence and purpose. Overall, Risen is a story of personal triumph, following a very relatable subject and groundbreaking artist, Razah, who uses his life wisdom and hip-hop skills to rise up against difficult odds to find true happiness.",False

This film teaches us to not give up when faced with adversity, but also about the love between two people and the dedication to their faith.

14,8,Inspiring,lebam-15027,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rison: The Story of Chron ""Hell Razah"" Smith.
It's always satisfying to see a movie about a topic that I knew nothing about and to come out loving the subject matter, the people in it, and the film as a whole. Rison: The Story of Chron was such a film. A moving documentary about rapper Hell Razah, who became the youngest member of Sunz of Man, an early affiliate group of the Wu-Tang Clan. Suddenly and without warnings, Chron had a brain aneurysm that deafened his voice and slowly pulled the music out from his inner soul. The years that followed were difficult as Hell Razah went into physical therapy, determined to get back to what he loved most, to become 'the music' once more. Rison: The Story of Chron took us into a world that was misunderstood by mainstream America and introduced us to hard-working artists who had something to say through the world of hip-hop. The Story of Chron is an inspiring and educational story that I strongly recommend.",False

I've never heard of Razah, so this turned into an exciting history lesson and eye-opening experience of how a 14-year-old can captivate people through music and talent. Surprisingly, I felt like all the people they interviewed had a strong presence on the camera and had cool stories to tell. For me, the documentary's format was: engaging story, music, repeat. If you like hip hop even a little, it's worth watching as a vital music documentary.",False
20,10,Wow...this defies description...right on!,kennyhughes,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a crazy cool ride. Very unpredictable. It starts with the hard core hip hop kids out of the east coast. So good for all the hard core kids to see this...cuz...it gets real in the best way. It starts with the music and the crazy creativity that rocketed them all out of the hood...and then...left turn...major medical issue...the kind that makes you grow up fast...then left turn...love and sacred discovery. I don't say this lightly...I don't flop over when someone says a religion BUT...when someone finds the sacred path through the inner city, creativity, fame, medical crisis, crash and burn and loss, struggle, hanging in, loss...then finding it. Like Luke in the cave with Yoda battling himself, like that time that any of us has lost it all and then hung on...except times 2000. Grow and learn by watching this all the way. It will twist and turn so get ready to take a ride.",False

I knew a lot about eighties rap music, but was not so well versed in the 2000's so it was so interesting to follow the journey of this artist. And what an amazing journey at that! The inspiring way he leads his life is uplifting even though what he went through and is still going through is so difficult and challenging. I had never even heard of the Sunz of Man and it was fascinating to me that their lyrics were about biblical stories as well as social issues. Personal struggle told in a compelling and visually interesting way. Well done! My kind of movie for sure.",False
24,9,A must for 90s hip hop fans,catia-ojeda,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary not only explores the early days of Hip Hop, but the story of rapper Hell Razah and Sunz of Man who are part of the Wu-Tang universe.

1,9,Thought-provoking and touching,mjenningswright,n/a,16/08/2025,"Profoundly incisive portraits of two colossal talents who shared some similarities but exhibited significant differences - mainly in how they treated others. It's in these differences that the film's power inheres. Really quite moving at times and great use of interesting source material (always nice to say hello, good evening and welcome to David Frost).",False

1,10,A must watch! ðŸ¦ˆ,armando_covelli,n/a,15/08/2025,"No spoilers. Highly recommend, especially if you're a Miami local, an angler, or you've been to Miami's Famous South Beach! You'll be amazed at the history. Awesome footage and interviews with many of the local fishermen of the time and the giant sharks they caught off the old 1920s ""Million Dollar Peer"" that used to be off todays's SOBE Nikki Beach on 1st street. You'll be amazed at the transformation Miami's South Pointe has gone through out the years that many people have no idea about. This documentary covers most of the history of Miami's famous South Beach starting in the 1920s and mostly 1960s, 70s and 80s! Very well made documentary on stories and footage that needed to be shared! ðŸ¦ˆ",False
2,10,Pretty Fire Movie,bkdegreaser,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie goes above and beyond telling a story and sharing a culture that doesn't often get talked about when Miami is being discussed. While its sold as a story about this very specific group punk rock fishermen in the Miami of decades past, it uses the time frame to explore a life style, a culture, and a way of life that is often left out of the conversation when Miami is talked about at large. The events this movie is centered on takes place long before I was born but as someone who considers themselves a Miami Native, I was shocked I hadn't heard it before! So whether you just like Miami Vice, are a fan of fishing, just like documentaries, this one is packed with a wild tale about some people who lived large and lived hard, the South Beach Shark Club!",False
3,10,Miami's Best Club is South Beach Shark Club,hannaolman,n/a,15/08/2025,"A must watch! South Beach Shark Club is an incredible documentary that has a little something for everyone. It is not only a true testament to the real history of Miami Beach, but also a fascinating look into the true grit and dedication to the sport. It introduces you to a delightfully charismatic community within it and their stories will have you borderline nostalgic afterwards, wishing you were there to see it all in person. Even if you aren't into fishing, you will be after you watch this.This doc will ""hook"" you in right away and you should ""catch"" it ASAP if you have yet to see it. Highly recommend!",False
4,10,An Amazing Story,devin-85902,n/a,15/08/2025,"No spoilers. This is an amazing documentary. Even if you think fishing is boring, I would highly recommend watching. The timing of the movie is perfect. Miami is experiencing hyper growth changing so quickly, and capturing and telling its history has never been more important. The story is great, it's well executed and produced. The characters are authentic. In theatre, I don't think there was a single person who wasn't blown away. If you're reading this review and you are on the fence about hitting play, just stop wasting your time, save yourself and hour of watching additional trailers and just press the damn button.",False
5,10,An Amazing Study of The Real Miami Beach Culture!,carmenmariarequejo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sensational!!! Never a dull moment!!! The Stunning Cinematography, Intriguing Interviews, Archival Footage and Immaculate Editing makes for a Most Stirring Adventure. South Beach Shark Club Captivates the Audience Capturing an Insight of the Diverse, Multicultural Community of Late 20th Century, particularly that of the ""Shark Club"". It Passionately Exposes us to a Lifestyle, which up till now, was Known Only to Prior Generations of Miami Beach Locals. The Film's Perspective ranging from Old School Shark Fishing Traditions to the Protection of these Magnificent Underseas Enigmas is Impressive!!! A MOST DEFINITE MUST WATCH!!!",False
6,10,Best shark documentary of all time,nlfitnesschris,n/a,15/08/2025,"The stories told by these gentlemen are incredible. Such a cool time in history, pioneers of land based shark fishing!! Great job, I recommend for anyone who ever wondered what it was like to catch a giant shark from land. Massive reels huge baits and a little bit of crazy!The directors did a great job at capturing a moment in time where sharks were the biggest thing going, when jaws was in the theaters. This is the real story if jaws!Also, a really cool prospective on miami in the 80's...a story about miami not filled with drugs and killings. More of great mentorship and guidance of troubled youth!MUST WATCH.",False
7,10,A Miami Sub-Culture Must See,farahharis,n/a,15/08/2025,"A story of yet another small community being pushed out of their stomping grounds by bigger interests and bigger pockets, South Beach Shark Club, in a way, is a story about us all.Also, as a side note, being born and raised in Miami Beach I can easily say there are VERY few authentic Miami Beach representations in Hollywood or anywhere really. This movie has FINALLY changed that and I couldn't be more proud!To be honest, I don't even care so much about fishing or sharks. To me, this movie is about this rag tag, subculture of guys (and some gals) in Miami Beach. Think Lords of Dog Town/Dog Town and Z boys: Miami edition.This documentary is about friendship, community, hope, love of the ocean, and all-out balls-to-the-wall fun and excitement. There's one story in particular that had me cry-laughing.The interviews are comedy gold and introduce characters the likes of which have rarely been seen. Mostly because they live under proverbial rocks (and maybe under some bridges).Must see!",False

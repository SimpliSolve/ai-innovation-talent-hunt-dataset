1,8,Wow!,hadamo-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Raw, Real, Heartbreaking, Brave, Unique, Different, Loving, Hopeful. I want to see more. I was happy to see tape of Jerrod and family from years ago. It seemed to show a lot of love between Jerrod and his Mom. It appears his Mom was naive when she was young and found the help she needed by giving her life to Christ and believing all that is in or at least, interpreted by some, as to what the Bible says. This seemed to help her deal with the difficulties in her marriage. Jerrod realized, at some point, he was not living his truth. When he told his truth, that really put a strain on the relationship between he and his Mom. I think the only thing that is coming between the love that his Mom, Cynthia has for Jerrod is, what SHE BELIEVES is the interpretation of the Bible regarding homosexuality.",False
2,9,"Raw, unapologetic, entertaining",qyyzjdva,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDefinitely an interesting and refreshing watch. A sincere look into Jerrod's personal life and the struggles he faces being gay coming from a Christian background. I really enjoy this show, sometimes cringy but that's real life. Jerrod is brave for making this show, and I think a pioneer of honesty in reality/ documentary television. This is coming from a straight woman, not that it should matter. It's interesting to see how he has become so successful in his career, yet deals with some heavy issues with his mother, still. At the end of the day we are all human beings with our own unique story, and the show is very interesting because it touches upon some uncomfortable topics like being gay which at the end of the day shouldn't be uncomfortable. Maybe that's the point of the show, it is what it is, we are who we are, and being ourselves shouldn't be so hard.",True
3,9,I hate celebrity culture and don't care about Jerrod's life...,Everything_Sonic,n/a,16/08/2025,"But the brilliance of this show is not to necessarily hyper-fixate on Jerrod in any self-aggrandizing way. Carmichael uses this meta-styled documentary to address universal conflicts that come with being gay and colored in America.Simply put - I don't even like Jerrod or care about his life - but to get this unique of a perspective into gay black culture has not been executed anywhere else on this level. Even if this was 100% fictional, it's still an incredible experience.Other topics such as infidelity and religious intolerance are brought up as well, but it doesn't always resolve itself as Carmichael acknowledges that he doesn't have the solutions.Carmichael knew that he could use his public image to therapeutically extend and relate to many viewers. I can certainly see this show helping people struggling with addiction, family issues, identity issues, etc. (Personally, having left the Pentecostal church due to its homophobia, the episodes of Jerrod with religion hit very close to home.)And massive props to the editing and production team linking all of these episodes so richly. Even if scenes from this are staged, it's still incredibly impressive.Highly recommend to watch if you're a minority or wanting to see something so original come out of the Black/LGBTQ+ community.",False
4,10,This,unoriginalfan,n/a,16/08/2025,"With only one episode out I am already fascinated and exited for the journey this shown will explore. Recognizing the bias and issues with being a reality show while trying to show the audience his truth. Jerrod Carmichael is seeking something with this and I for one am glad to be along for what I can only assume will be a hilarious, uncomfortable, and one hope fulfilling sojourn in the world of reality television. Family issues that are all too familiar to black queer people are front and center. His friend taking a stark stance against the entire endeavor of Jerrod participating in this reality show. A soundtrack that is delightfully whimsical. And I did not even get to the Emmys thing. I am excited for what this program will be and is.",False
5,4,Meh...,michaelalovaglia,n/a,16/08/2025,I like this guy's laid back humor but this show is really pulling back the curtain and probably not the way Jerrod anticipated. I think he is shown as a narcissist and displays jerk behavior towards his boyfriend and friends . I know he is on the rise but the diva attitude is not appealing. He sometimes comes off as downright mean. I hope he grows a bit through the experience and even watches himself in the episodes. I have watched the first few episodes and not sure I would recommend. I know comics have baggage and that's what makes them funny but I don't enjoy comics who don't seem to be tuned into others feelings when they're not performing.,False
6,9,Carmichael Reveals Hidden Layers with Painful Candor,EUyeshima,n/a,16/08/2025,"Six episodes in, Jerrod Carmichael's 2024 reality series has been often harshly cathartic and sometimes acutely funny. The reality aspect is no joke as he pulls no punches in making public the personal challenges of being a successful comedian who came out just two years ago. A charismatic personality, Carmichael shifts mercurially between introspective and cruel, but it's hard not to root for him. I got hooked when he painfully confessed his unrequited love for his best friend in the first episode. So far, it has cut deepest with the episodes focused on a road trip with his errant father and a frigid homecoming with his deeply religious mother. Some moments border on exploitative, yet it may be the best, bravest thing on TV now.",False
7,5,Uncomfortable!,cden4,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have such mixed feelings about this show. On the one hand, I really appreciate Jarrod's transparency and openness. It's refreshing to see a gay person share their life so unabashedly. On the other hand, I really do not like how he seems to keep making such bad decisions and then simply laughs them off. Coming out later in life is hard, but it doesn't give one permission to treat others like crap. I hope as the show goes on that his outlook matures a bit. It seems like he's trying, but whatever he's doing isn't working. I want to just reach through the TV and say ""get yourself together!"" He seems very stuck in his own head so far, and I just keep cringing!",False
8,9,Wow!,elliot-11885,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is uncomfortable in a way that really makes you think about what's going on. Jerrod is an unmistakable force, even when he's being a horrible human being. That he can put this on the screen.... Is he truly just a manchild making up for lost time? A man playing five-dimensional chess with your viewing? Somewhere in between? It's uncomfortable and riveting, with some very funny moments. Is it what reality television should always be? If you think Married At First Sight is high quality, this probably isn't for you. If you want a challenging view of how an imperfect individual navigates his new-found fame without being afraid to show his warts, this is a great choice.",False
9,10,WATCH THE WHOLE THING,suzyqboo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is incredibly beautiful. I made an account just to review this because of how undeserving the bad reviews of this show are.

10,10,Too cringe for me,b4blue,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't think it's not genuine. It's too genuine and relatable, not by its content but form. Watching a reality show with this much transparency makes me feel rally uncomfortable. Perhaps if he was one of those vapid celebrities, it would be easier to watch. I can't even confront my own things from the past and they often don't let me sleep. To have all of this unfold in front of cameras is ... brave or completely insane. But, he is a standup comic. They develop thick skin if they want to last in this business. I don't think this is a mainstream kind of show. Not many will get it, but those who do, will appreciate it immensely.",False
11,1,Boring,JustinJKanter,n/a,16/08/2025,"This reality TV show following Jerrod C, falls flat due to the comic's self-serving self-awareness. Instead of genuine moments, viewers endure calculated performances and manufactured pauses and a weird structure. Comedians' narcissism detracts from authenticity, leaving audiences disconnected. The balance between authenticity and entertainment is crucial. When comics prioritize ego over connection, the result is a hollow spectacle, devoid of genuine emotion. Authenticity is key; without it, the show and its subject lose its charm, leaving viewers longing for a truth that is not coming, because the self-servingly self-aware are never that fun to be around.",False
12,1,Extremely disappointed in Jerrod,sai-29804,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis show was a very disappointing personal perspective of another celebrity that I didn't want to know about. It's giving Jada pinkett Smith at a red table talk... He was revealing very personal information about one's background and members of Jerrod's closest circle. I was such a fan of him and his stand up in the past and I'm a big supporter of LGBT so to get an inside of his coming out was a very exciting perspective that I was eager to watch after his special. Unfortunately from the start we see him putting his supposed best friend on blast in front of a camera to confront Jerrod's feelings for him. Jerrod openly cheating on his boyfriend and then parading a semi-nude photo of him to his father to make his father uncomfortable about his sexuality later in the season. Then there's a terrible moment where he calls his father a slave when he's realizing that his father was a sharecropper and worked the fields, after making fun of him walking with a hunched back as an older man. He then shows specific editing of a financial contrast of his childhood friend who grew up in foster homes and his wealthy life and then tries to coach him into being a better comedian. But in all actuality he's just teaching him how to sit in a chair in front of an audience and use them as a therapy session, which is what Jerrod did in the first four episodes, reading his mom's text or listening to her voicemails in front of a live audience while he tells awkward personal stories and gets a few breaks of laughs here and there... I'mma finish this series because I want to have a full perspective on who he is because he wants us to know. I genuinely do not see him continuing a career in comedy if this is how he's going to do comedy. If you want to be this dramatic just be an actor... Leave your personal life to your personal life, especially when it's embarrassing other people. And I didn't even mention how much of a terrible best man he was and friend... He's just a really bad person and not funny any more. He saw how this was edited and still let it out, which means he really didn't care. How sad to not care about how you make other people look ...",True
13,1,Disappointing,newguygaming,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jerrod Carmichael, known for his sharp wit and astute observations on societal norms, took a leap into the world of reality TV with much anticipation. However, the reality show, touted as a glimpse into his personal and professional life, falls flat on multiple fronts, leaving viewers with a sense of dissatisfaction and unmet expectations.From the outset, the show lacks a cohesive narrative structure, instead opting for a disjointed series of events that fail to engage the audience. The supposed ""behind-the-scenes"" look at Carmichael's life comes across as contrived and scripted, with little authenticity shining through. Viewers hoping for genuine insights into Carmichael's creative process or personal struggles will be sorely disappointed, as the show barely scratches the surface of his life and career.One of the glaring issues with the reality show is its lack of substance. Instead of delving into meaningful conversations or exploring thought-provoking themes, the episodes are filled with mundane activities and trivial interactions. Whether it's Carmichael's breakfast choices or his casual conversations with friends, there's a distinct absence of depth that leaves viewers questioning the purpose of tuning in.Moreover, the show's pacing is sluggish, with long stretches of seemingly aimless footage that do little to advance the narrative. Scenes linger for far too long without offering any meaningful insights or entertainment value, resulting in a tedious viewing experience. It feels as though Carmichael and the production team struggled to fill each episode with compelling content, leading to a sense of padding and filler material.One of the most disappointing aspects of the reality show is its failure to capitalize on Carmichael's comedic talents. As a stand-up comedian known for his sharp wit and incisive humor, one would expect the show to be filled with laughter and witty banter. Unfortunately, the comedic moments are few and far between, overshadowed by the show's overall lack of direction and purpose.Furthermore, the portrayal of Carmichael himself is oddly detached and enigmatic. Instead of offering viewers a glimpse into his inner world, he remains a distant and elusive figure throughout the series. The lack of vulnerability and authenticity from the show's protagonist only serves to further alienate the audience, making it difficult to emotionally invest in his journey.In addition to its narrative shortcomings, the reality show also suffers from technical flaws that detract from the viewing experience. Poor editing choices, amateurish camera work, and inconsistent sound quality all contribute to a sense of amateurism that is difficult to overlook. It's clear that the production team behind the show lacked the expertise and attention to detail needed to create a polished and professional product.Ultimately, Jerrod Carmichael's foray into reality television falls short of expectations on multiple levels. Lacking in substance, coherence, and entertainment value, the reality show fails to resonate with viewers or leave a lasting impression. Instead of offering a compelling glimpse into Carmichael's world, it serves as a forgettable and ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience.",False
14,1,Really Annoying To Watch,mylovebugtravel,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTerrible TV. I was so uncomfortable watching this. From the episode where he tried to have his friend unpack childhood trauma through stand up was so stoooopid. All the dude did was curse. And tell stories that were probably untrue.Then the episode where his mom said she accepted him, but the way she did wasnt good enough for him. He needed to create fake drama about conditions on her love.What took the cake for me was him brinign his Dad's business on the show. That showed the true narcissist in him.He is such a boring, self serving fake homo. He needs the world stop on its axis to accept a lifestyle that he barely made his way into.Him disrespecting his mother and father behind this weird homeless lookin boyfriend is pitiful. I hadnt heard of the ""comic"" before this series, and I question a network giving this boring, self serving ""reality show"" the green light.",True
15,3,Self-deprecating isn't pretty,ccorral419,n/a,16/08/2025,"HBO has gone out on the limb recently introducing several ""unique"" shows: Painting with John, The Rehearsal and now Jerrod Carmichael's Reality Show. Of the three, Carmichael's 2024 Gotham TV Award for Breakthrough Nonfiction Series deserves some attention.Comedian Jerrod Carmichael (2022 Emmy-wining comedy special ""Rothaniel"") was given an eight-episode series from HBO following his coming out and desire to speak personally about his family relations. Why an individual needs/desires a public format in which to throw their family/friends/lovers under the bus, and why HBO was willing to green light the idea, is baffling.I don't know Carmichael's comedy, so maybe his self-deprecating, Me, Me, Me style is his thing? If it is, I don't find it funny or interesting.Throughout the series, he uses the camera to hide behind how poorly he treats himself, his family and his boyfriend. So embarrassed to be part of Carmichael's series, a ""friend"" will only appear in a mask and altered voice.Trying to wrap his comedy into the series, he occasionally drops in and out of his stand-up (sit-down) comedy routine. Why his audience would sit through his self-absorbed rambling doesn't make sense. If he wants a therapy session, why invite an audience. Get a therapist and get a room! Supporting his lack of self-respect for himself and his audience, he appears on stage wearing crocks and socks and demonstrates a total lack in taste for his appearance.Carmichael managed to get his 15-minutes of fame and some. Unfortunately, he took many people down with him.",False
16,1,Pretentious narcissistic mess,denissalvz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though most audiences absolutely hated this show, critics still praise it-unsurprising for an industry plant. This is why fewer people are watching TV; they push people on you even when it's clear they have no talent. I thought his special ""Rothaniel"" was interesting, not very funny, but as a gay person myself, I enjoy a good coming-out story. HBO keeps advertising this guy, so I watched it, and it was okay, but not something I would recommend. Then this reality show came out, and once again, it's advertised everywhere-magazines, late shows, HBO ads-and I'm left wondering: was this supposed to be funny? This show is extremely disappointing if you're expecting laughter. I watched it with a room full of people who visibly cringed, not just at the awkward scenarios Jerrod puts people in, but also at the cringy things he says throughout the show. He's so painfully unlikable and narcissistic, but I can almost guarantee there will be more HBO contracts for this guy but I don't think he can milk this whole coming out thing for much longer he might have to develop a likable personality.",False
17,1,"Yikes, what a mess...",WiretapStudios,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know Jerrod from his actual stand up career, before he did TV shows and things like that. He was good in Neighbors, etc. I enjoyed his delivery and style.This however, is a cringe fest and a slog to get through. I thought he would be really chill and rational behind the scenes based on my exposure to him, but he actually turned out to be someone I don't like, I doubt I'll follow him after this.I'm not sure about anyone else, but the majority of the show felt so extremely staged that it felt fake. I don't doubt some of this happened, but it feels like a recreation of the actual events for the majority of it. Most scenes make me actually cringe. Jerrod has such a poor attitude in almost all of this, rude and somewhat mean. Also, with Tyler, he kept pressing him even though Tyler gave him an answer already, and I'm sure before the filming when it actually happened. Jerrod keeps pressing him and if this was a straight guy doing this to a woman, it would be called out immediately.Overall, not a recommend. I'd actually recommend Jerrod take a long hard look at the footage and ask himself if that's the kind of person he wants to be. He comes off like a spoiled queen when he's essentially just a run of the mill gay guy who has enough money that he should be out living his life and not mining his personal life for cringe that's better kept behind the scenes. I have a lot of gay friends and if any of them acted like he does towards other people, they wouldn't be a friend very long.",False

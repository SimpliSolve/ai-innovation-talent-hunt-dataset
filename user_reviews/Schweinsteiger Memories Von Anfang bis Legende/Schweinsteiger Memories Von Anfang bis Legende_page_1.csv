1,7,An uncomplete puzzle,DLochner,n/a,15/08/2025,"A great person and athlete. The documentary only approaches its strength to a limited extent, but very well in large parts. The film shows Schweinsteiger in his young years and then abruptly gets into the complete football history of Bayern Munich and the great success of the athlete - like the World Cup 2014. The greatest strength of the documentary is certainly its emotionality, which is sometimes used very unevenly becomes. If the first half of the film is very slow, if not banal, the second half looks like a firework of emotions. Here one can definitely criticize the sometimes exaggerated and unnecessarily dramatic music. All in all a great documentary. Anyone who knows the film about Schweinsteiger's colleague Toni Kross will also find favor here. Even if the last one was a little better in my eyes.",False
2,10,Must watch,farhanhossain-38786,n/a,15/08/2025,Greatest series ever. Please watch the story of the beat midfielder of his generation.,False
3,10,So emotional!,niels_wor,n/a,15/08/2025,If you like Bastian Schweinsteiger this movie is a must. It's so nice to see what kind of person that big sportsman was!,False
4,6,"Nothing new, no background infos",sergcatalan,n/a,15/08/2025,"If I look a such movie/documentary, I want to get backgroundinfos, storys from the changing room or how he met his wife.
In this documentation, you get all the infos that you know allready when you go on his wikipedia page. The speeches from his former teammates and coaches are good, but nothing where I said ""wow"". So an easy looking movie, made and produces by his homie Til Schweiger, but the deepness of this documentary is missing.",False
5,10,One of the Best Football Movies I've Ever Seen,jovana_ivetic,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of the most beautiful and best movies about football and a football star I've ever seen. There are excerpts from his life and stories with his colleagues and other famous players he played with. It's a comprehensive and complete overview of Basti's career, full of memories. I loved it.",False
6,10,Not a football fan...,moreit,n/a,15/08/2025,"... even I was moved by his emotionality, honesty, teamspirit, loyalty and skill. Great guy and a masterpiece of a sports related documentary. Thanks.",False
7,10,Fußball Gott (no offense to any other Gods),kosmasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"Now there are other clubs and players that have been called ""Fußball God"", which would be the God of Football (or soccer I reckon if you are American). Schweinsteiger more than deserves that name and this documentary is a showcase of why that is. From the start and hardships (and many mistakes, you know as young people do), through the humble first steps (although one might argue Basti wasn't that humble to begin with) up to the giving it all to win as much as possible.Now if you are a fan of his main club Bayern Munich, you will get even more out of this. But even if you are not their biggest fan there is much fun to be had here. But also a lot of sadness. Because sometimes to win big, you have to lose it all first. And Schweini has lost quite a few things throughout his career. But he also won a lot ... and as he can't stop saying: It is all about memories. And you believe him when he's saying certain things: you believe that he is a fan, that he loves the game. And that he is not made for accepting loss. And yet he can maintain a youthfulness to him.The interviews with teammates, his wife, his friends are all showing and assmebling a picture of who he is. There could be more who would be able to speak (the absence of Phillip Lahm seems odd for example), but there is only so much time in the movie that can be spend with any of the interviewees ... so it is what it is. And it is amazing! I had quite a few moments that got to me emotionally - not sure it'll be the same for many or at the same moments, but the way this is edited, really adds up to that. One of the best documentaries concerning an athlete (in football, because obviously Michael Jordan is Goat and above all else)",False
8,5,Better watch the world cup 2014 finale,domas-st,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerFor a sports documentary this movie falls short of closer insights. Most of the details being depicted have been known to the public anyway (e.g. friendship to Neureuther and schweinsteiger's ambitions in professional skiing). As in general there is nothing wrong about a sports documentary to be emotional this movie is way over the top peaking in schweinsteiger's greetings for convicted tax dodger (and at the time inmate) Uli Hoeneß. So in my opinion we're better off spending 120 minutes on watching the wc 2014 finale again enjoying schweinsteiger's most exceptional performance than on this at best average feature.,True
9,10,Only the Sport,iSelektor,n/a,15/08/2025,Only the sport is important about hie life. Thank you. Great docu!,False
10,1,"Nothing new, nothing exciting",danijel-spasojevic,n/a,15/08/2025,"Unfortunately, in the documentary I couldn't find anything really new about Schweinsteiger. The scenes are all mixed up in the film and unfortunately no dramaturgy. Nevertheless, Schweinsteiger has been a great soccer player as a person.",False

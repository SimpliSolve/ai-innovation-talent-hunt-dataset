1,8,Life after death,paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's common to think of the kind of person who could shoot up a school as a monster, who must have been raised by the worst kind of parents. But maybe some of them were just mixed-up kids, whose own lives (as well as those of their victims) were destroyed because they were able to get access to guns. And maybe their parents were just doing their best, defeated by some combintation of adversity and their offspring's inscrutability. In this film, three parents of school shooters go on the record to speak about rebuilding their own lives in the shadow of their own grief and shame. All of them come across as essentially good people, and while I am sure there are others who could criticise their lives, the portrait of individuals made to shoulder a terrible responsibility by fate is compelling. It's also worth noting the absurd penalties applied by the U. S. ""justice"" system; one the shooters (perhaps not coincidentally, an African American), was sentenced to 114 years plus life in gaol. Of course there were other, ""innocent"" victims; but school shootings are rare outside the United States. There has to be a better way of organising society than to let such things happen, then locking up the perpatrators and throwing away the keys.",False
2,6,Interesting subject,lbissegger,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is full of the parent doing normal household things, which probably is in it because of a good reason but for me it made the film to slow and I really have to make an effort to finish it. I have respect for these parents and think their voice should be heard!",False
3,10,Very good and touching document,f-vanlaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very good documentary about the parents of school shooters, challenging the view that you would spontaneously have of them.",False
4,1,Too slow,rorycunneen-29740,n/a,15/08/2025,Far too many slow shots of people shopping or doing garden work (in a garden that's never been worked on) needs a ruthless editor to get rid of the pointless long shots.,False
5,9,Great Movie,cillian-j-89,n/a,15/08/2025,"A little slow, but otherwise it was a very thought-provoking and interesting movie. There wasn't much going on on the screen (It shows the parents doing everyday things) which is what made it a little hard to finish, but it is still a great movie in my opinion.",False

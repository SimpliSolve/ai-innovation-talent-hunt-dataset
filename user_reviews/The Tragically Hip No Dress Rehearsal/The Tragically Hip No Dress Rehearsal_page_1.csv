1,10,"For a Good Life, You Just Might Have to Weaken",dafoe23,n/a,16/08/2025,"I consider myself somewhat of a ""mans man"". Usually keep my emotion close to my chest. There were several times throughout the first 3 parts of this excellently produced docu-series I found myself choking back a few tears. By the end of part four I couldn't hold back any longer. It was a sharp reminder of how important this band was to not only myself - but the country I love.The director Mike Downie, Gord's brother, captured all the emotion and uniquely Canadian mystique of the Tragically Hip from their humble beginnings gigging in small bars to playing sold out stadiums. Behind the scenes triumphs and tribulations. Watching them evolve artistically and as people. I was fascinated that all this footage was captured and glad that he decided to make this series.I will be recommending this to anyone who is a fan of music, history and fantastic documentaries.5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",False
2,10,Most intimate rock doc ever,mncgkbp,n/a,16/08/2025,"So well done that I hope people discover this band that may have missed them. I never cried so much my entire a life. It is a beautiful piece of work.If you are Canadian rock fan, between the ages of 40-55, this if the most important band of your adolescence/early adulthood. This documentary hits at the right notes, tugs on your heart strings. It's so raw and emotional.If you are a rock fan this is an absolute must see. I think this doc may finally get the hip the profile they deserve outside of Canada.600 words? Really? What happened to brevity. Nine is going to read 600 words I've written.k. 600+.Just watch it.",False
3,9,"Engaging, emotional and a journey like no other",bmcpherson-83968,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love this documentary series by Mike Downie. He does a fantastic job of illustrating the band's roots from their youth in Kingston Ontario to their epic journey captivating Canada in their farewell tour and final performance.The doc series provides context on how they came to be, their friendships, their internal conflict and their drive to deliver music with Canadian content. The only knock against it is some of the added guest interviews - for example, too many cameos from the trailer park boys and Justin Trudeau, but there are some nice surprise guests too. Otherwise a fantastic series for lovers of music, Canadian content and rock history.I watched all 4 episodes (an hour each) within 2 days. If you love the Hip be ready to binge. Highly recommend!",False
4,9,There's this f*#kin' band you gotta see,davidshannon-84377,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this documentary.As soon is it started, I swiftly realized that while I grew up with the Hip, I didn't really know a whole lot about them. I knew all the music, at least up to World Container, the lyrics, etc. But I didn't know much about the band themselves except for that they came from Kingston.The series successfully covers the band's beginnings, their path to success across Canada, their less than successful years and their truly inspirational final tour across Canada.I'd recommended this series to both hardcore fans and to those new to the Hip as well.Long live the Tragically Hip.",False
5,9,The life of a band from start to end,bavielhaber,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great documentary about a band more people should know about, and even if they aren't your cup of tea, a great story about friends and family and creativity.From their early days in high school, to the farewell tour that concluded in their hometown of Kingston, this four-part series does a wonderful job telling the story of The Tragically Hip to fans and newbies alike.The conglomeration of the American music industry has starved us of many international bands and their talent. I was glad to have access to MuchMusic to see the Hip. I encourage you to find the time to watch this documentary and be inspired.",False
6,10,The soundtrack of our lives,cmrpunisher,n/a,16/08/2025,"We are all richer for having seen this. Thank you so much to The Tragically Hip for sharing this with us. You have brought so much joy to our lives and continue to do so, please keep sharing we appreciate every moment with you! This is the greatest music documentary I have ever seen, the behind the scenes of the rise of The Tragically Hip to the top of their game was amazing to watch. It brought back so many memories. If this film doesn't bring out emotions in you, you're already dead inside. I want to thank every member of the band and everyone involved with the making of this masterpiece!!!!",False
7,10,Perfectly captured the band that perfectly captured Canada,c-faye-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a beautiful homage to the quintessential Canadian rock band the Tragically Hip.I loved how well the documentary captured Gord Downie and how much I learned about the rest of the band.The Hip's journey is told in an intimate and engaging way that only made me love the band even more. The last episode had me balling, even more so than when I watched the last Hip show live.The interviews with the band members, family, friends, associates, and many Canadian icons helps tell their storyThis is a definite must watch for any Canadian and it made me realize how much I miss The Hip. What a beautiful tribute by Gord's brother.Rest in peace to Gord Downie and to The Tragically Hip.",False
8,9,Loved it,peter-mercier,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this 4-part documentary. It was very moving and so great to hear the songs, see the performances and hear from the band, their family, and related musicians & talent.I grew up in Toronto during this time but never saw the band in Canada as I moved away in the mid 1990s. I feel super fortunate to have seen them twice overseas in intimate venues during their peak and sang & sweated it out with everyone else. This was therefore a very emotional documentary capturing that experience. The band wrote some wonderful songs and the documentary did a great job highlighting Gord Downie's unique contribution as a performer, signer and wonderful lyricist.Thank you to Amazon/MGM, to the band, and their families for making this film possible. Yours - a home sick Canadian.",False
9,10,"Courage, His Word",callmepaully,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. I assume that most people outside of Canada do not know the band the Tragically Hip. I was first introduced to them by my Canadian cousin back in the 90's. Their music was always a great combination of bangers and beauty. But the lyrics... the lyrics! So stunningly profound and beautiful, but entirely without presence.This documentary is a love letter to fans everywhere. It reveals the beauty and the artistry that the Hip displayed throughout their career.As a writer, I am always drawn to the written word. Often I laugh at the words of others. Sometimes I am inspired by what I have read. But with Gord Downie's words I am left feeling amazed and in awe. I often get overwhelmed knowing that what he has made seem so simple, is just genius flowing from a 4 colored pen.There are no sufficient words to rate this homage, because the only person who could write them has been taken from us too soon.",False
10,10,Just Beautiful,mxximills,n/a,16/08/2025,"@briz: I hear you. To me it shows that deep deep deep down, there is a person inside JT, or at least there was at some point. And Gord believed in him, believed that he would start the long road of reparations to First Nations people. He has to live every day knowing he is letting down Gord Downie.He's only in it a bit, don't punish yourself. It's really good! Just take a swig of beer or something at those parts and ignore him.*******I started crying 1 minute and 8 seconds in and had to take lots of breaks. Afterwards I watched the entire last concert and dug deeping into the stories behind the songs. I may not have had a productive weekend, but it was worth it.",False
11,10,Oh My Canadian Musical Heart!,lorav-818-177162,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust WOW! So incredibly personal, touching and well done. The fact that there is so much video and footage from 30+ years ago is remarkable! As a huge fan I felt it truly showed the essence of this band. A band like no other. Thank you to everyone involved for making this docu-series possible! Even though the wound of Gord's loss just re opened, this watch was absolutely worth it! Seeing them young again was just beautiful. All so talented and humble. What a gift the The Tragically Hip were/are! And Gord Downie, a poet like no other.This is a must watch for all music fans!10/10 love love love.",True
12,7,Great Documentary,hkhdswdjz,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI was working at a music store during the height of the Tragically Hips popularity. Watching this documentary brought me back to the good days. I unfortunately got jaded by the popularity and stopped listening to there music for awhile now. Watching the documentary brought back how great the music was and still is.Their music was great from the beginning. The documentary brings you from the beginning to the end. The band was so talented right from the start. I enjoyed watching the making of the music. I learned the ins and outs of the bands career. I never really appreciated the longevity as well as all the fantastic music they created. As a casual Tragically Hip fan I'm glad I was glad to watch.Unfortunately seeing a certain politician during the documentary brought it down from 10 stars to seven. Thank god for fast forward button.,True
13,5,5 small town boys who achieved greatness...,thedrisdelles,n/a,16/08/2025,"""It's the journey - of how a small-town band from Kingston, Ontario became national treasures. ""The four-hour docuseries, directed by Gord's brother Mike Downie, leans on the band's collective memory to retrace how a few schoolyard pals became one of the country's most popular bands with a greatest hits album outsold only by the Beatles in Canada.""Mike Downie chronicles the history and impact of the Tragically Hip"" IMPACT meaning the monumental greatness of this band-not only in Canada- but the world... Unlike Canadas PM JT who has literally no business being part of this documentary. This documentary should be edited to remove all scenes of JT.",False
14,10,The best documentary I've ever seen.,johnrgraham-16654,n/a,16/08/2025,"Full disclosure, I'm a big fan of TTH. However, regardless of that fact, this doc is so well-done and thoroughly entertaining and precise, that it shattered my expectations.I also had the pleasure of also seeing the first half screened at the VIFF (Vancouver International Film Festival) with the surviving members, director, manager, etc in attendance (Fun fact: Craig Northey of the Vancouver band The Odds was in attendance - he and Rob Baker perform in Stripper's Union together). I had difficulty keeping it together. Such an emotional journey that is perfectly captured in this film.Give it a watch and stay until the ending, which I found incredibly fitting and moving.",False
15,10,11 Stars!!!,film180,n/a,16/08/2025,"American fans always felt like we were in on Canada's best kept secret. I was first introduced to The Hip in 1991 when a friend loaned me their first album... I never gave it back. I once saw them play to a room of 30 die hard American fans and they treated us like we were 30,000! They were my Beatles, my Rolling Stones, and this documentary perfectly illustrates why they have meant so much to so many. Exceptional and intricate music played by wonderfully talented musicians. Intelligent, insightful, inspiring lyrics delivered by music's most dynamic frontmen, and a group of lifelong friends who always put the music and their fans ahead of their own egos. I devoured this documentary and will do so again... and again. Thank you Mike Downie for this amazing tribute! If I could give this 11 stars I certainly would.",False
16,10,A must-see,djoenzy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Impeccable documentary about Canada's most beloved band. If you are a Canadian, or even like a few of the Hip's songs, you must watch this documentary-series. It covers the band's beginnings, rise to fame, extended-success, and final days on their last tour before leader singer Gord Downie tragically passes away of cancer. This band exemplified the Canada and Canadians from the ordinary man, to the biker, to the philosopher. The doc-series does an excellent job of providing the band's history along with behind the scene footage and interesting tidbits of informations that even die hard fans didn't know about. It's incredibly honest, funny, and both heart warming and heart wrenching. I watched it at a TIFF event and was so happy to sing along at times and ""embarrassed"" to have cried at times.Incredible job by Mike and co.",False
17,10,Must watch!,freeoakfirewood,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love music documentaries and don't really care if I watch ones of musicians I know or like but just want to learn more about music history. But this is up there with the Last Waltz and Stop Making Senes as one the of best music docs of all time. I had heard of the band before but I couldn't name one Hip song prior to watching this and now can't stop listening to them. They have this tight grove that's indescribable while having lyrics that are inspiring and unforgettable. They are an extremely talented band and this movie is so well done, so intimate, comprehensive and touching you will be too if you aren't already. Amazing.",False
18,9,Mandatory Viewing and not just for every Canadian,sainttravismm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredible documentary and story covering one of the greatest bands of all-time.This is a story covering 30+ years and follows the fellas from high school to their peak , filling arenas and stadiums and then the heartbreaking brain cancer diagnosis of Gord.The only very minor criticism is that they put the pharma nazi scumbag and liar Justin Trudeau in this for a minute of 2 and the only reason i didn't give this 10/10 rating.Have some tissue handy for the end.If you're human your eyes will get wet.Fantastic job by Mike and the band.RIP Gordie you absolute legend and one of a kind.",False
19,2,I don't understand the high reviews,styanmike,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, I can see how someone who loved this band would be interested in this 4 hour plus in depth documentary. But for any regular person who liked a few of their songs this is 3 hours too long and a perfect watch if you can't sleep. I really like documentaries on musical acts but this might be the most boring, slowest, uninteresting one I've ever seen.I kept waiting for it to pick up but it never did. There was way too much commentary of no interest or relevance. None of the band members are unique or interesting, no good stories.I personally think Gord Downie is a talented singer but his politics were typical Eastern Canada liberal garb. How dumb would you have to be to put JT in your doc.",False

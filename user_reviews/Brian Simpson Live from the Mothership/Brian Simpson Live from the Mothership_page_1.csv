1,10,Funny and worth the watch,beasleybytes,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wanted something easy to put on before bed and this hit the spot. A solid comedian. Even the jokes that I don't personally agree are still delivered in an amusing way, which I appreciate. No agenda, just a solid hour of laughs from me.You could see people in the crowd getting upset over certain material, but I think he did a good job with his crowd work and brought most people back into the fold.He also does a pretty decent job of bridging the gap between generations with his jokes. Nothing in the set feels forced or preachy.As long as you aren't hypersensitive (you know who you are) you should be able to put it on and enjoy yourself. I wish more comedians could get back to just telling jokes and funny introspective stuff like this again.",False
2,9,Hilarious,sam-1668,n/a,15/08/2025,"I followed Brian Simpson on Instagram after seeing some funny clips and instantly watched this special on sight.I love his timing and overall delivery, but his writing is exceedingly clever when approaching topics that we've heard before. The driver's license bit, for example, is a brilliant twist on observations that I first heard from George Carlin in 1992.For its considerable runtime, the set is very well paced and the closing segments had me laughing the hardest. More than anything, I admire the confidence of a road-tested comic who's not afraid to take his time and challenge the audience!",False
3,1,Sorry but this just wasn't not for me.,kingcnut23,n/a,15/08/2025,"As the title says this just wasn't for me, I didn't laugh once, evidently the audience wasn't exactly blown away by Brian's comedic talent either as they barely laughed too. Don't get me wrong there certainly was plenty of whopping and cheering, laughing, on the other hand, precious little of that, the audience reaction was more appropriate for a rally than a comedy show.By the end I found myself incredibly frustrated by this show, Brian Simpson is clearly an intelligent person, he's just not very funny. The jokes are also well told, they're just not funny. Brian is definitely good storyteller he just seems to completely lack that funny spark, I can imagine sitting around with him having a few beers, shooting the breeze and having a grand old time, I suspect the laughs would be few and far between though.",False
4,1,Sorry but No,katie1977,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMy title tells you want you need to know. So disappointing as we were looking forward to watching this. Is it even possible for a comedian to do a set without constantly talking about racism non stop? It felt like the audience was held hostage because if they didn't laugh they would be called racist. Watch the audience and you'll see how uncomfortable everyone is. This guy needs therapy. I feel bad for people that live their life in bubble where they see themselves as a perpetual victim. It's exhausting to watch and not funny. Oh well, plenty of other comedians to check out on Netflix. Too bad as this comic wasted a golden opportunity to gain some fans from a Netflix special.",True
5,4,VIEWS ON FILM review of Brian Simpson: Live from the Mothership,burlesonjesse5,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFew stand-up specials feature a comic you've never heard of before but here we are with 2024's Brian Simpson: Live from the Mothership. I mean when the guy in question (Brian Simpson) doesn't have a wiki page except that he's listed as a 60-year-old jazz pianist when you google him, well you wonder how Netflix got a hold of his smoke. ""That's pretty darn stressful"". Yeah Brian, it is.Anyhow, ""Mothership"" is seventy minutes of Brian waxing about everything from racism to men/women contrasts to COVID and then back to feminism, being short in height, and female bod parts. It's done sporadically as all comedians do, jumping from topic to topic like a tranquil moderator at a candid debate. ""Mothership's"" unseasoned director (Baron Vaughn), well he shoots Simpson in basically close-ups, wide-s, and medium long shots, giving the film a glossy, TV feel. No intro flashback scene, no aerial of the city where filming took place, no fluff, just basic stuff.So OK, you're probably wondering if I enjoyed the potty-mouthed filler that is Brian Simpson: Live from the Mothership. Well I didn't really, for the simple fact that it didn't make me chuckle, guffaw, or snort once. I mean maybe if I was in the throng of happy-go-lucky onlookers, with a few free drinks supplied, a provided laugh track, and some gummies, maybe. But the problem here is Simpson and his snarky delivery of jokes. He'd rather patronize his audience and be somewhat upset with them than check his self-conceit at the door and give up the funny. Heck, Chris Rock is the comedian he wished he could've been (or will be). Sure Simpson is intelligent, insightful, audible, a good storyteller, and a guy who can be coolheaded on stage. But so are get-up-and-go speakers at high schools, kickoff meetings, and/or business symposiums. Jump this ""ship"".",True

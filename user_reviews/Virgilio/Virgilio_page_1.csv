1,8,To the Ones that Really Know Gastronomy Only,BornKnight,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a documentary by Netflix is very informative and shows well the passion and project for both of the Chef's Virgilio Martínez Véliz and Pía Léon (of Central, in Peru, the best restaurant of the world) since the beginning of the project to the new project's of his wife and ex sous chef Pía León - they married in 2013 (Kjolle, annex to the Central) and new projects like Mater Initiative that collects true interaction with comunes data and promote local business in the search new ingredients.From the design of plates and interior to the search of new ingredients, and evolution of the projects and their lives since the beginning.Not a movie to everyone, but surely a great documentary for everyone that enjoys gastronomy as I do.Score: 8.5 out of 10.0 / A -",True
2,4,Mediocre Documentary,kellybrainard,n/a,16/08/2025,The subject is so interesting it's too bad the execution of this documentary was so mediocre. I'm sure this story could have been told in a much more interesting fashion but it managed to be rather boring. Interviews were rather flat and interesting visuals were few and far between. I feel like there was so much potential with this story. There was allot of superficial information that was repeated and visual shots that were repeated. Many of the scenes seemed staged and contrived. Interviews that were not that interesting could have cut to visuals that were informative and added interest. Lost opportunity. Netflix's Chef's Table (season/volume 3) episode on Virgilio is much better.,False

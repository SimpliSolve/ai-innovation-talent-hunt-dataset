1,7,Ripple Effect,GBAraujo88,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is an excellent introduction to Bitcoin in general. It uses accessible language to explain complex concepts while efficiently presenting Bitcoin history, philosophy and use cases.Those looking for the most advanced, up-to-date topics on Bitcoin should look elsewhere since the documentary introduces Bitcoin to a non-technical audience.The title is an exciting match for how Bitcoin rules interconnect with modern-day societies' moral values or ethics presently inherited or preserved by religions. Could Bitcoin serve as a foundational structure to protect moral values and ethics? The test of time continuously pushes Bitcoin to new grounds of adoption, and this documentary indicates Bitcoin is an alternative to the current monetary system. While it builds solid reasoning as to why Bitcoin can be such an alternative, it fails to develop if there are any downsides to massively scaling and adopting Bitcoin. Nonetheless, the documentary provides a valuable view of how Bitcoin aligns with truth by transparency as the foundation for a monetary system. It also plants some questions for the future: Will capitalism evolve? Will the world adopt Bitcoin as currency? Will Bitcoin become the ultimate alpha as a store of value?Time will tell what the future will be and if Bitcoin plays any role. As of 2024, Bitcoin's lifetime has surpassed any given obituaries with increased worldwide adoption and value besides volatility, and that... is Bitcoin's ripple effect.",False

3,1,Random youtube compilation,crowelitelvl,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is a compilation of random youtube videos, no one put effort to describe technicalities and problems surrounding cryptocurrency and how it can help in everyday life.I am surprised this ""product"" has it's own IMDb page, even the title is cringe putting religion next to technology.This video seems more like a propaganda for people to buy into Bitcoin and nothing else, while closing eyes to problems Bitcoin face today like scalability issues which supposed to be fixed by Lightning Network but it itself has problems to scale and on top of that it has big centralization issues.If you want to know more about cryptocurrencies, this is not for you as you will just waste your time and learn nothing in the progress.",False
4,2,What is the process for crypto scam recovery?,benedictdanielle,n/a,15/08/2025,"An investment company on Telegram stole my Bitcoin. Life became so frustrating to the extent I fell sick and spent some days in the hospital. I can't imagine a single mother like me losing $42k just like that. I went to a local police station and made a report but nothing was done. I did all I could do within my powers to recover my lost funds but all was in vain. I nearly give up. All I did was start looking for help on the internet, with friends and work colleagues. They told me about the Digicon site where I met (brigadiatechremikeable (@) proton (.) me) He asked for a little commitment which I did immediately cause I was ready to get my funds back. He brought back life to me by recovering %100 of my lost funds. Contact him now for help.",False

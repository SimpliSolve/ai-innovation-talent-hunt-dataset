1,2,Mike Bara ruins this documentary,golonwes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mike Bara ruins this documentary, without him it would have been much better.First, his tone and manner of talking is quite ignorant. He speculates on old photographs of the moon and considers his speculations as truth. Which is the exact opposite of science - as he claims he is an engineer one would think he would know better. This guy wrote and sold a bunch of conspiracy books - including the 2012 Mayan supposed 'prohpecy'. What happened there? How did we all magically survive 2012? That tells you the credibility this person hasOtherwise, this is actually an entertaining documentary. I enjoyed seeing footage of astronauts and interviews I haven't seen before. I do believe there is non-human intellgent life, but unfortunately this documentary does not show that, just some simple conclusion jumping, speculation with no hard evidence.",False

1,4,"Not really worth your time or money, watch the directors other works instead, he is not untalented.",infernoguyrules,n/a,16/08/2025,"Poor. I came into this with high hopes having seen ""Room 237"" and ""The Nightmare"" previously, and harboring a strong interest in the simulation hypothesis. I get what he was trying to do, basically what he was doing in those last 2 movies, he wanted to center this less on the truth of the matter or convincing the viewer of anything, and more on the experiences of the subjects interviewed. The 3d animation is very enjoyable, but sadly the underlying interviews skew mostly towards random, often delusional, ruminations on experiences in which the subjects felt they percieved the titular ""glitch inthe matrix"", interspersed with only very few actual philosophers or scientists offering actual substantive thought on the idea of simulation theory. There are also, interspersed, archival footage sections in which phillip k. dick divulges his own experiences which in many ways align with those of the other subjects. About 40 minutes into the film i became rather disenchanted and started to scan through for more interesting sections, finding few. I think the time allotted would have been better served exploring more of what philosophers and scientists have to say about the possibility that we exist in a simulated universe, or could create one in the future, etc. Instead i got some folks ruminating on their experiences playing GTA, talking about how modern games suck, Reciting drowning pool lyrics, and talking about how much they love(hate?) the matrix. Just go read reddit or something, Google simulation theory and you'll have a better time.",False
2,6,Want to learn Simulation Hypothesis?,TheTruthofItIs,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off this is a documentary, and one that except for a lot of production trickery thrown in (speakers clothed in avatar animations, animated scenes, and background music) would be really boring since it's a series of interviews. A bunch of people discuss Simulation Hypothesis which contends that reality is a simulation run by higher order beings, including a 1977 speech by Philip K Dick (who's ref'ed alot in this) where he states ""we're living in a computer programmed reality."" Later, Elon Musk asserts there's only a one-in-billions chance that we're in the Base (or true) Reality. There are references to computer games and simulations, most notably Minecraft, though not Civilization or The Sims, as well as ""The Matrix"" films a quote from which this doc derives its title. The doc is interesting in a seminar kind of way, you get a broad overview of this topic from a variety of speakers so that's decent. But the most interesting and possibly the most important thing to bear in mind is something noted at the very beginning, that a college teacher of the narrator once noted that through the ages, we attempt to explain our brain and nervous system in the context of the highest level of technology known at the time. Thus, given photo-realistic computer games, simulations, and virtual reality you have many people attempting to explain reality in that context, apparently unaware that they're simply doing what everyone's done since our caveman ancestors. Personally, I think this topic would do much better as a short six-ep streaming series since it lends itself so well to animations and cut-scenes from current computer simulations and VR games.",False
3,6,A rare documentary that asks a question it knows it can't answer,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Glitch In The Matrix is a radical, uniquely-presented look at simulation theory in the digital age - specifically, how those who prescribe to the notion that we're all living in a simulation came to those beliefs and how this belief affects their outlook. Dense, but accessible, directed by Rodney Ascher, it's the rare documentary that asks a question it knows it can't answer.In the late 1970s, famed author Phillip K. Dick, known for his sci-fi stories, gave a talk where he laid out his theory that we are living in a simulation. This becomes the entry point into the maw of simulation theory, its depth only outmatched by its complexity. A Glitch In The Matrix utilizes a famed and celebrated movie as its main frame of reference in exploring its theme -- The Matrix, a film that put simulation theory into the mainstream. Ascher's film investigates where stimulation theory stemmed from, how its tenets and principles have been echoed throughout history by everyone from Plato to Elon Musk to current times.The conceit of A Glitch In The Matrix can't so much be explored as marveled at, and the possibilities of a simulated reality tinkered with, and so that's exactly what it does. This film boldly depicts this proposed reality entirely through CG animation and clips from popular culture that have dealt with similar ideas. I respect that a film about simulations indulges so heavily in them. For example, many people who speak in the film have their identities shielded by virtual avatars that filter their perspectives, enhancing the feel of a simulation. This method of using simulation techniques in a film about simulation gets very ""meta,"" but, in doing so, adheres to and honors the film's topic and not in a show-offy or self-congratulatory way.I have respect for any movie that seeks to make you question the world you live in. Socially and politically, A Glitch In The Matrix does that quite literally. If you're looking for a documentary that finds the key to its main topic and deconstructs it bit by bit, this isn't that, but if you're willing to go on a bit of a journey through a school of thought via the lens of a capable filmmaker that challenges what you think about your own reality, sit down, give this a chance and enjoy it. A Glitch In The Matrix is left incomplete almost by design, but somehow that works to its charm.I give A Glitch In The Matrix 3 out of 5 stars and an age rating of 14 to 18 for some simulated violence and the description of a violent crime. It just premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival, and it will be available in theaters and at home on February 5, 2021. Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST",False
4,2,What a wasted opportunity,dave-w-brown,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an interesting subject that deserves consideration, but ended up being a collection of anecdotal evidence, fantasy-like characters and focused on people who were obsessed and unrealistic in their approach.Had it focused more on the actual subject and looked at evidence and serious arguments, it would have made a more enjoyable experience,That's two hours of mu life I'm not getting back.",False
5,n/a,Too dumb,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was expecting more than listening to anecdotes of dissociative experiences. Most people have had similar thoughts, boys. It's a very common human thing. If you've had a stoned discussion with a friend or two, or have studied philosophy on the most basic level, nothing in this will blow your mind. I was hoping for a deeper scientific discussion, and not so attached to pop culture imagery. It's like they hit every angsty teenage boy movie possible, and that was very distracting. I guess if their narrow target was angsty teenage boys it could be considered a success. It just could've been a lot smarter. Watch Devs instead.",False
6,7,A Start,michael_fisher-98025,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is not a scientific look at the reality of the simulation theory, but how humans are grappling with the idea that they are living in a simulation and how that guides their choices in living life. It uses individuals who have crossed over from just contemplating the idea to actually believing it to be their reality. I enjoyed It.",False
7,1,So bad,yabiss,n/a,16/08/2025,"Couldn't finish it. The interviews with guys in weird digital cosplay outfits that have no value to add are completely distracting.

9,3,Nothing new. No science.,matt-233-497899,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you were in a college dorm getting baked with your friends after watching The Matrix in 1999 - you won't learn anything new. I was hoping for some science and actual scientists. Instead I got random youtubers behind goofy avatars. Philip K Dick's lecture from the 70's was pretty interesting though, so it gets a few stars for that. If you're REALLY interested in seeing this, wait until it's free.",False
10,7,"Clearly not for everyone, but I was very entertained",Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, many ideas presented here seem ridiculous, and I would say the lack of a central, coherent argument hurts it by the end. Every interviewer seems to have a slightly different idea of what ""the simulation"" is or would be, and though video game comparisons come up, it's never like, clear on whether it's a multiplayer game, or a single player game, or if we're all NPCs until someone takes control etc etc...But I'll give it this: it's loopy, fast-paced, and extremely entertaining. Whether any of it is right or wrong is almost irrelevant- I found it incredibly engaging and fun to watch. It embraces the wildness of its ideas and interviewees, and such an approach is always better than documentaries which try to discuss and break down an out there subject in a dry, calculated way, to convince you they're some kind of objective.While a central argument or idea would have been satisfying, maybe by presenting a host of them, the documentary's admitting that it's not trying to come up with an answer, and maybe I can respect that.I'm no more or less convinced that reality could be simulated, and maybe the negative reviews are from people who wanted that? I don't know, I found this too entertaining to dislike, and even if the ideas were preposterous, they were also engaging, especially when paired with the crazy presentation. So I'm not quite sure why the score is so low to be honest.",False

12,8,Contemplating the nature of reality,hadar-20,n/a,16/08/2025,"Personally I'm a big supporter of the simulation theory. I find it to be a very logical explanation to the way the world works and to our role in it as human beings. So naturally I found this doc fascinating. Perhaps because it was made in Covid times, the film makes extensive use of animation and the interviews are done through video chats (some of the subjects dressed up as digital avatars). It actually works for the film , considering the subject matter. I would've liked to see more focus on the role of consciousness in a simulated world but the film doesn't go the spiritual route. Being entertainment first and foremost, it focuses more on the wild idea that we all live in some giant computer in some advanced technology's office building. It also highlights the danger inherent when an unstable mind is influenced by the simulation theory. But all in all the movie is a positive and welcome addition to the growing conversation around this topic. There's much more material to mine here, so hopefully we will see more movies about this. At the end of the day, what's more important than the nature of reality itself?",False
13,6,Very entertaining - I also am a conspiracy head.,lespaulmojo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is compelling enough to keep engagement throughout, little bit weird on the CGI but at least it's different. Dissapointed to find it not really have any mic drop moments. The ending story with the loner kid that was weirdly obsessed with the matrix left the whole doc to end on a bummer note instead of a wonderful mystery. Would have been much better to see that as an everyday crazy and not an example.of.what the theory is as a whole. Conspiracy stuff is supposed to be fun because it's ridiculous, but this was more like the ridiculous trying to be deep. When ultimately the subject matter will never be taken seriously if the people making it and in it have a air of ""I'm smarter than you"" which even if true is just a c*nty way to go about selling someone a make beleives. This review has to be 150 characters so I'm gonna keep typing until this bulls*it goes away.",True
14,1,Terrible,davelydon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've been browsing IMDB regularly for years and this film motivated me to register to rate it. It is awful.The main narrative is made up of people who want to give too much meaning to their badly articulated philosophical musings, and a kid who thought he was in the matrix and shot his parents. Despite the chapters, there is no structure, and no justification or explanation of the themes: just huge leaps like 'I didn't have friends as a kid, or I noticed an orange fish, therefore simulation'.The one expert they had on (wrote a seminal thesis on simulation theory) was either so bad at getting his point across, or so poorly edited, he came across as clueless as the Joe Publics they disguised with comical avatars.Probably the worst documentary I've ever watched, and less informative than a pub debate.",True
15,3,Basement Dwellers Dominate,saccitygrl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI think the simulation theory is very intriguing but this movie doesn't really explore it.
Rather it takes this topic to a panel of basement dwellers who conflate this theory with their own myopic take on reality and in some cases delusions.
The film largely focuses on the delusions or narcissistic tendencies of a certain type of white male. To make matters worse, the film's arc lands with a psychopath's take on his cold blooded murder of his parents while in some sort of depressive psychosis. Chilling to say the least. Including this in the film seems to unravel all the discussion leading up to this point in the film by conflating the embracement of the simulation theory with hedonistic nilhism.
Definitely not worth paying to rent/see.",True

18,1,Pointless waste of time.,rtipping68,n/a,16/08/2025,This was poor. It seems to centre on the views of some guys who spend too much time on video games who probably live at home and are well into their 30s. The type of people who never date or can't and work at a gaming store. They are not qualified to have an opinion on anything other than comicon let alone be in a documentary on such a fascinating subject.There is a guy who shot his parents who I think should have been on a different documentary because it had no relevance to the core subject.

22,1,Watch something else,rodrigococorrea,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm chocked by how superficial this documentary is, scientifically but also and most importantly how it lacks any comprehension about ethics and spiritual growth. It spends so much time (2 hours of uninteresting random interviews) trying to convince people of the simulation theory and it forgets to ask and debate how to make sense of this reality, what are the real lessons that we have to learn from this cyclical existence, why are we in it and how come we are consciously interconnected and interdependent, instead of seeing everyone else as literally shootable characters. The film asks ""once we know it's all a simulation, what keeps us from shooting and killing each other?"" The answer is simple: because we have human values that transcend the idea of just acting to our own materialistic benefit. It's so sad that the film doesn't enlighten the audience in any way towards that. I hope its creators and collaborators keep looking for the answers they seek in a brighter light. 🙌",False

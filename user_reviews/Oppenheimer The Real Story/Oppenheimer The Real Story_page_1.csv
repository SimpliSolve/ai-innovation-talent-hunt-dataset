1,6,Good documentary,Bleuuue,n/a,15/08/2025,Ultra low budget documentary. Looks it was filmed with an iPhone and a crew of 2. Lots of historical footage and interviews with few people about the guy. The story was told well and was interesting and for a documentary it was too boring. My wife fell asleep in ten. It took me almost an hour. It did take me several more days to finish it Still I recommend the documentary before the movie. Good opportunity to refresh on historical events in chronological order and get the know the man biography. They could have told the story in an hour instead of ninety eight minutes. Or they could have made more effort to talk about similar programs overseas in comparison.,False
2,10,An excellent documentary!,codigi1,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is a much needed and appreciated balance to the recent film. It fulfills the task of filling in other aspects and experiences of Oppenheimer's complex and profound life. The film was very well produced and enacted and brings many important revelations to bear; however, it is limited in some respects just by the very nature of the film medium. The documentary OPPENHEIMER; THE REAL STORY is able to go beyond those limits and adds many important specifics and perspectives, not only on Oppenheimer's life, i.e. His personal story, but sheds light on the social and historical circumstances of the birth, development and future risks of the nuclear age. We are also given more details regarding the actual achievements and amazing accomplishments of the project at Los Alamos. This documentary is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",False
3,10,Your reviews of this movie are purely political and completely laughable.,henry-99067,n/a,15/08/2025,"The bad reviews came from people who refuse to admit to or confront the truth, it exposes the Republican Party for what it is. Oppenheimer' demise came during the Eisenhower administration which also, at the behest of Britain's Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, overturned the democratic government of Iran, so that the British could keep their oil rights.With these people reviewing movies it makes it extremely hard to take anything that I see on your app believable. It seems as though he's reviewers were encouraged to downplay this documentary to give the new movie "" Oppenheimer"" coming out more plausibility.",False
4,1,Awful.,tobarryspencer,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is horrendous. Cheaply produced, terrible quality, messages repeated over and over again. None if the interviewees seemed like authority figures - just various folks that had probably done a bit of research the day before filming.Undoubtedly edited on a dated iMac using iMovie.At one part they tryed to recreate a burial at sea. Apparently they didn't have an urn to perform the reenactment. So, they just threw an old black propane cylinder into the water - to, I guess, give you the general idea.Was this an attempt to cash in on the upcoming feature film? Undoubtedly.Don't waste your money.",False
5,5,Interesting tho Mediocrity,Musicianmagic,n/a,15/08/2025,J. Robert Oppenheimer is an interesting subject and so this documentary is interesting. But the Talking Heads spout a lot of conjecture. Actual facts were in short supply. I think they interview only one person that actually met Oppenheimer and they had no knowledge or contact from during or before Los Alamos. Curious I don't recall them mentioning when he was married and had kids until towards the end that he started visiting the Virgin Islands with his wife.This easily could have been edited to under 30 minutes (from 98) without losing any real content.If you really are interested in the high points (they don't go very in depth) of Oppenheimer's life and do not know any more than the fiction movie than it might be worth a watch. Otherwise there are much better biographies of his found on YouTube.,False
6,1,"Unwatchable, worse than CSPAN",Cazeran,n/a,15/08/2025,"I rarely give a 1-star rating, but it takes real skill to turn the exciting life of a world renowned genius into something more boring than watching a court hearing on CPSAN. How is this a 2023 production? Bad camera work, irrelevant stock footage shots, meandering dialogues, snail slow storyline, no animations, and a sleepy stock elevator soundtrack. Even a documentary needs a storyline/script beyond a chronological list of events, variation in content beyond interviews and landscape shots, a modern camera with quality lighting, and some kind of animations. If you want to see how this could be done with much less budget, check out ""Why Oppenheimer Deserves His Own Movie"" by Veritasium.",False
7,1,Absolutely a horrible documentary,cartwright-50852,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love watching documentaries. This is not a documentary. It lacks facts and real insight. It is random speculation and innuendo. The people speaking seem to have no credibility or firsthand knowledge of Oppenheimer. I am embarrassed to have rented this movie. This could be ""The Rocky Horror"" of documentaries. It is so bad I made some toast and threw it at my TV!The guy with white hair is laughable. It is just his opinion.The bald guy with a beard says Oppenheimer was brutally abused at the Ethical School but then fails to elaborate. Story telling at its worst.At some point, one of the people says no one can understand quantum physics. Really? Just stupid.",False
8,2,Poorly done - just plagiarizing Wikipedia,jenniferted,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is almost word for word from Wikipedia - not very good research!! I was reading Wikipedia while watching the show and noticed the narration was nearly identical. I always was taught it was plagiarism unless you referenced your sources and researched on your own.Would've been more helpful to research themselves and write using different sources.The film and narration was somewhat boring and simple.Since the Oppenheimer movie came out, it seems like there are more shows and documentaries coming on streaming about Oppenheimer. Everybody seems to be jumping on the bandwagon and it worked for me because I wanted to learn more about the real man before watching the movie as usually they take artistic license and add events that aren't real.Disappointing and not well written or researched.And would've appreciated a more known person as a narrator.",False
9,3,Misleading Title. Looks like it was Shot on Betamax.,nickdoff-03888,n/a,15/08/2025,"With this coming out at the release of the wonderful feature film, the title falsely suggests that the real story wasn't told in the Nolan movie.In comparison to the. Oboe and modern production standards this looks rushed out without enough budget and time to go a good job. The quality of the photography looks like something from the 80s, the audio is all over the place and the pacing of the script is lumpen.The only thing extra that gives you as far as context on Oppenheimer. It is early life and his life after the slice of time featured in the movie. I really feel I've had 98 minutes stolen from me.",False
10,3,Watching Paint Dry Would Be More Interesting,WereWolf1776,n/a,15/08/2025,"Seriously, as I titled my review, watching paint dry would be more interesting. The individuals who narrate this documentary speak so slow or they continually pause as if they constantly lose their train of thought. This documentary was a snooze fest and it should be marketed as a sure cure for people with insomnia. It was reminiscent of those boring films we were forced to watch in science class. The material on Oppenheimer is super interesting but this documentary hired the most uninteresting British folks who spoke as if their voices were putting their faces to sleep. Their monotone descriptions of Oppenheimer's early days were as far as I could get. I had to turn this boring documentary off only 15 minutes in.No thanks!!",False
11,1,Bad,jarirsaleh,n/a,15/08/2025,"Those who try to analyze the psychology of a genius are fools, regardless of how much knowledge and what high degrees they have in psychology. Genius is entirely based on sensory, i.e., pure biology, and not at all on psychology. In fact, what makes a genius is extraordinary sensory and what defeats and destroys a genius is those of ""normal"" sensory, who are often skilled in psychoanalysis because that does not require much brain power. Those of ""normal"" sensory are the antidote of geniuses. They shame them into corners (e.g., Oppenheimer, Tesla), chase them running for their lives out of entire countries (e.g., Kepler, Einstein), drive them to suicide (e.g., Boltzmann) and often to madness (e.g., Newton).",False
12,3,A doc made for someone other than me,mickeythechamp,n/a,15/08/2025,"While Oppenheimer is an interesting figure in history, only a few aspects of him are really interesting to me. That is the entire war aspect on him and that´s about it. This documentary gives a whole history of the man from start to finish and if that is what you are looking for and are interested in, I think you´ll like this doc a bit more than me. This was a bit out of my subject matter interested, but again it might be for someone a bit more interested in Oppenheimer as a person history. Other than that it is a bit of a pure production on the other aspects in terms of sound and picture and that makes it fault a bit too.The history of the father of the atomic bomb. This documentary focuses on Oppenheimer from the start to the end of his life.This documentary had a hard time keeping my interest. It is presented in a pretty dull way be just people talking and the first and last parts are less interesting and sounds more like speculation more than fact. It is the aspects of his upbringing and last years that just simply don't land with me. It is not that interesting but it might be if you want a full picture of the man the doc is about,. To me a good documentary presents the most interesting aspect of something, this one presents everything, and while wholistic, it is also not that interesting for it. The last and first part also sound more speculative, not really presented with much fact other then, ""these guys wrote books on Oppenheimer"" and while there properly is a lot of fact in those books, they are not really people with a lot of credit to me and they talk about Oppenheimer as if they knew him. It just becomes a bit too much of people trying to glorify someone they barely knew.The sound Desing is a bit all over the place here. Some people are miked a bit too well where you can hear their mouth wetness and that is not something I find pleasant, and others are miked a bit poorly where it sound amateurish. It´s a bit all over the place and seems like a rushed production. Same with the music that sounds like some YouTube stock music sometimes. The B-roll is also not that great or interesting, very boring to look at with only some interesting archival footage here and there. My favourite B-roll is them throwing a bottle into the ocean, recreating the ashes of Oppenheimer being thrown into the ocean and that was comical to me.The doc seems a bit unfocused at times, the beginning and end is very focused on the man, but as soon as it gets to the war it start talking about the war, the players, the race, the intelligence and espionage. It becomes less about Oppenheimer and more about the entire situation and that was more interesting to me. That was the part that kept me engaged while the rest did not really interest me that much.But the overall story and what it represents is interring to me. I like hearing about how somebody like this came to be and how a man with so much power handled it in real life and not as a fictional philosophical hypothesis. The whole war aspect is fascinating but is sadly not really the focus point of the doc.This is probably a fine enough doc, with some bad production aspects, but it had a hard time engaging me. But I have always said, a good storyteller can sell you anything and that rings true for a documentary too. If you are great at telling a story, you can make a doc about anything interesting to anyone, but here I was not engaged.",False

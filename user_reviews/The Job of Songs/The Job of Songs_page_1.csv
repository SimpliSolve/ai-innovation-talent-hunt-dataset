1,10,"A gem that is cultured, happy, sad, mad and I'm glad I watched it",francis-foley,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary engaged me from the very first moment to the last frame. It was beautifully shot in little village of Doolin and the surrounding area. The main characters in it live and breed Irish music, one of the things the English couldn't take from us. I loved the accent and wit of Christy Barry, the concertina playing of. Christy McNamara, the passion of Luka Bloom for the area, his sister Anne Rynne, the stunning voice of Katie Theasby to pick out but a few.This film deals with the music itself, the passion people have for it, what it means to them and why the are passing it on so that it lives for generations to come.If you want to get a taste of our music then just listen to Katie Theasby singing: I remember you singing this song. .",False
2,10,Music Defined,hiblerjude,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was one of the most compelling documentaries I have ever watched. Thank you to all who participated. Your thoughts, music, friendships, and values were as attractive as were all who participated. I, too, have a love of music that reaches into my soul, touches it like a butterfly, and impacts me as if struck by lightning. I was especially taken with the thoughts of Luka Bloom, as well as his sister. Thank you again, one and all.When I went to hit the submit button, I was told my review was ""too short!!"" There is a first for everything! Wait until I tell my family that I needed to talk more! Jude Hibler - Colorado, USA.",False
3,10,Loved this!,kcjoeyhall-39706,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watch a lot of music documentaries & have a particular soft spot for Irish music and the culture surrounding & supporting it. This might be my new favorite! It's a beautiful film visually, and each and every story told was compelling. Run time is just over an hour and when the credits began to roll, I wasn't ready! I wanted more stories! And more of Katie Theasby's beautiful singing. It's a lovely, lovely, documentary. An easy 10/10. I will be watching it again.My review's also too short, but not for lack of enthusiasm. Haha I'm writing this while Katie Theasby's gorgeous voice fills my home. You should watch this movie!",False

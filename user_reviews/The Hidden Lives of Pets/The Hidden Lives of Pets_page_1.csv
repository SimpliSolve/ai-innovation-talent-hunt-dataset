1,7,Needs more cats,bombalurina1,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's very interesting, but there's not enough of nature's more awesome pets. Whenever it mentions cats, it dies so too quickly. Even bunnies seem to get more screen time. I hope there's a second season with more cats!",False
2,6,Super cute but not enough on cats,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As Episode 1 of ""The Hidden Lives of Pets"" (2022 release from the UK; 4 episodes ranging from 30 to 34 min each) opens, we are introduced to Bruno and his collie as they are walking in the Swiss mountains. Bruno loves to basejump, and one day he takes his collie with him on his next basejump... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into Episode 1Couple of comments: when I think of ""pets"", I must admit that I think primarily of dogs and cats, even though there are many other pets of course. This series does pay attention to dogs and cats, although the primary attention is on those many other pets: parrots, bunnies, rats, goldfish, you name it, this series has it. It makes for enjoyable viewing, even instructive viewing at times, but I will admit that, as a decades-long owner of a cat (I am on my third cat over the last 30 years or so), I wish that this series paid more attention to the ""hidden lives"" of cats. All that aside, I was entertained by this mini-series, and these 4 episodes few by in no time.""The Hidden Lives of Pets"" started streaming on Netflix several months ago. It was in fact my daughter who alerted me to this series, and it was upon her recommendation that I recently checked it out. I binge-watched all 4 episodes in a single setting. If you have a pet, be it a dog or cat or any other species, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
3,6,What normal person basejumps with his dog?,alexanderlund-18439,n/a,16/08/2025,"They mention that its all about the dogs 'trust' with its owner ... well it didn't have a choice did it.Regardless a lot of interesting points, and animals. Very good show overall.",False
4,9,"Adorable, but makes you wonder how ethical...",sbarbaric-29441,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show is full of adorable animals who can do stuff none of us thought they could, and although it's fairly obvious that giving the animals more activities makes their intelligence and cognition far higher, there's still a question of ethics in some of the examples.For example, the parachute guy obviously loves his dog to pieces, but should be aware that him reading his dog's behaviour without having a proper education for it might just be a confirmation bias. He should most definitely test dog's stress levels after a jump, just like those scientists did with the rats.",False
5,10,Great show!!!,Just-A-Girl-14,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved it! Animals are amazing in every way and this show proves that! They have extraordinary abilities and are highly intelligent! The more people educate themselves about it, the more both humans and animals benefit!If you love animals or if you own a pet I'd definitely recommend this show! It's very interesting and fun to watch and the animals are also really adorable! I hope they make more episodes because I can watch this show all day! Highly recommend!",False
6,10,I watched twice in two days,ek-44154,n/a,16/08/2025,T made me want pets even more and I wanted pets a lot already. Now I want a very wide variety of pets. I watched this when I was sick and it made me happy. There was SOOOOOOOO much amazing facts and things. I love it and totally recommend it.,False
7,8,The Hidden Lives of Dogs,nchisley-96199,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Hidden lives of Dogs is a new show and requested by Les Shepherd at NBC.Please air on NBC Public Television in United States and Washington DC.The Hidden Lives of Dogs is about Bow wows and purr-fect pets. Meet amazing creatures from around the world and dig into the latest science on our animal friends' senses and skills.The show is full of adorable animals who can do stuff none of us thought they could, and although it's fairly obvious that giving the animals more activities makes their intelligence and cognition far higher, there's still a question of ethics in some of the examples. IMDb Rating 7.2.",True
8,1,Somebody take that idiot's dog away.,jessup-86446,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show lost me the moment bonehead went off the cliff with his dog.He yapped a bunch about 'reducing the risk as much as possible' when making the custom harness for his pooch, but that doesn't mean there is no risk!I once saw a YouTube clip of a man skateboarding while holding a baby, and I asked the same question then: beyond the risk of death or serious injury, what is the dog getting out of this?I don't know if Switzerland has laws to protect animals from this kind of stupidity, but it damn well should.0 stars. Don't sensationalize animal abuse and try to convince me it's cute.",False
9,1,Disgusting Start,kmr-22308,n/a,16/08/2025,"This isn't the Hidden Lives of Pets. It should be called Narcissist Jerks Who Abuse Animals. I lasted 5 minutes. Thanks for another POS show, Netflix. Is it any wonder your days are numbered.",False
10,4,A base jumping dog and a surfing cat?,VeggieVader,n/a,16/08/2025,"A base jumping dog and a surfing cat?First I just want to say that jumping of a cliff with a dog is nuts, irresponsible and egoistic! This part was the worst of the show, and it should be reported.Surfing with a cat is also a bit risky. Sure, it's cool with a cat surfing, and you can clearly see that the cat is not afraid of water, but what happens when the cat accidently falls off and end up under water?Theese two examples made me rate this show way lower than I would have otherwise.I have two cats myself, and I would have loved to see more about cats. To learn more about their behavior and the meaning of their different ""meows"".I did learn some things by watching this. I did not know that dogs have a ""built in"" heat sensor, or that cats can sense the magnetic field of Earth which they use as a tracking system. The dog with all the buttons was also kinda cool.",False
11,3,Dogs dogs dogs,windsorenquirer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Too much about dogs, not enough about other pets. And actually nothing really about hidden lives of our pets more about what they can do, what tricks they can perform and how clever they are (dogs).It still might be an entertaining show for animal lovers but don't expect to learn anything new about our pets.",False
12,1,"Irresponsible and stupid at best, wreckless and cruel at worst",purplevonshmurple,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like the other commenter here, I cannot fathom in what reality anyone would convince themselves (or indeed a television media giant would try to convince it's viewers) that it is acceptable to jump off a cliff holding your dog for ""fun"". If you so easily interperet clear anxiety signals as your pet wanting to plummet into a valley, quite possibly to a painful death, then you should be banned from EVER having one.Yes, of course a pet dog is going to be concerned if it sees his owner disappear over the side of a cliff - partly because of the bond but also because it's a domesticated animal that relies on it's caregiver for food, shelter and protection. ""Constructed a harness"" - nope, that's a Ruffwear harness with some carabiners stuck on it.The shots of them in the air show that the dog is panting and continually licking it's lips - any dog owner or animal person with half a brain cell knows this doesn't mean they are 'having fun'.""Like humans, dogs have an innate sense of self preservation, but Kazuza's bond with Bruno, means that his emotional intelligence overcomes his instinct"". What a complete load of garbage. The dog doesn't have a choice in the matter. It's nothing to do with 'emotional intelligence'. It's pure human ego and nothing more. Shame on you Netflix for providing such completely inaccurate information. You have a responsibility to your viewers to not encourage this kind of appalling and abusive behaviour.Do not watch this series if you have mental illness - which Bruno clearly does - and are prone to outlandish suggestions and information that may cause you to do something stupid to your pets (or yourself).",False

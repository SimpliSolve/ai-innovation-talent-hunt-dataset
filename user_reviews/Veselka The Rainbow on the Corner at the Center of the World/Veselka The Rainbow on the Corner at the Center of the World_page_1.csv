1,8,Great Restaurant and Human Interest Story,MikeyB1793,n/a,17/08/2025,"This Ukrainian restaurant has been in the family for generations. It started off as a candy store - and then expanded to be the restaurant that it is now. It evolved with the constantly expanding night life of New York City.We get to view the owners and the people working in the restaurant - and also to see some of the wonderful food.We experience the anguish and the agony they have all undergone since the Russian invasion of their country. Many are worried about their family members. One worker is re-united with his mother, who came to be with him in New York. It's a touching and warm story of those who work in this restaurant.",False
2,10,Veselka - A Film About Family,scottmusgrave,n/a,17/08/2025,"Veselka is a terrific film. It is really about family. The film starts with 3 generations of family that founded and grew the Veselka restaurant business in the East Village of NYC. But it is also about the extended Ukrainian family that grew out of that business accelerated by the war in Ukraine. If you are from NYC or Kansas, I believe you will find the story and the people in the film to be inspirational. Actor David Duchovny did a great job narrating Veselka and saxophonist David Sanborn is an important part of the fabulous soundtrack. The film is in limited release now. I reccomend that you find it at a theater near you now!!",False
3,10,"""Go see it"" is all I can say about Veselka!",kljermansen,n/a,17/08/2025,"""Go see it!"" is all I can say about Veselka! It is full of beautiful, heartwarming, moving, timely and raw human stories. With music by David Sanborn, narration by David Duchovny, the stories bring you into the film. Directed, produced, written and edited by the talented and creative Michael Fiore, the movie is a reminder of real life and the struggles that people face with war, even thousands of miles away. But Veselka also reminds me that food and eateries, especially internationally focused ones, allow people to gather to do more than just eat. Even more, the movie shows that there are good humans in the world making a difference for the better. The world needs to see these impactful stories.",False
4,10,Beautiful and unexpected documentary!,jeffrardo,n/a,17/08/2025,"Honestly, this film had me at Veselka, the delicious east village staple that's been around for many years but what I didn't expect was how moving the story turned out to be in relation to the war in the Ukraine. Like all great documentaries and movies in general, the film took me on an emotional journey into the humanity of its' real life characters who deal with the unfolding war over the course of a year.Ultimately, this is a film about family and the filmmaker's empathy and respect for its' subjects and the cinema verite approach leads to truly poignant moments on screen that will take you from tears to warm laughter. This is the stuff of life and the kind of documentary filmmaking we should all embrace.",False
5,10,Incredible film and a must watch!!,myliusaaron,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is such an incredible and moving movie that shows not only the ins and outs of a locally loved restaurant, but of a family that truly sticks together during tough times. This movie shows you just how hard the war has hit Ukrainians and how they have banded together to help one another. You will see some of the harsh realities but you will also experience the powerful love they all share and how they overcome such terrible circumstances. The owners of Veselka are some truly wonderful people and will have you marveling at their generosity and tenacity. A remarkable piece that I cannot recommend enough!",False
6,10,Two Thumbs Up for Veselka!,kaylischattner,n/a,17/08/2025,"The minute I heard there was going to be a documentary made about the incredible East Village haunt, Veselka, I knew I had to watch. Am I glad I did!I walked away from this movie completely moved. A powerful story of community, the impact small businesses play in the fabric of world events (in this case, the war in Ukraine), and family.The empathy, great sense of community care, vulnerability, and joy of the people featured in the documentary is palpable. You can feel their impact and intentions emanate from the screen.I encourage all to watch Veselka and to find the people doing this important work in their own communities. This is how we change the world.",False
7,10,Genuine and Poignant,ChrissieNYCDC,n/a,17/08/2025,"As a 30 resident of NYC, who clubbed in the East Village in the good old days, Veselka was an infamous NYC institution that everyone knew for the 24/7. Before social media, before the Internet, and before mobile phones, it was a place that people connected, socialized, ate
Re, drank, and lived.There's no way possible the producers could have ever imagined how poignant and important this documentary is, given just this past week in politics.I might have initially given it seven stars. There's a much deeper moment in history going on here, especially when put side-to-side to current affairs. For those of you who don't know the legacy, or lived in NYC, I think the story couldn't be more relevant to each and every one of us, on levels were about to understand. The historical parallels, the absolute honesty to the story, and moreover a reminder that empathy and humanity must prevail . . . .It just has to.",False
8,10,The hearts of men,cez-97776,n/a,17/08/2025,"I believe that all Americans should know the story of Veselka, especially American men who feel lost.The men of the Veselka family are immigrants and American born who know the existential terror of tyranny or are terrorized for the people of Ukraine. They are bonded to protect their families and freedom by their courage, compassion, love and hard work. I believe that this beautiful film also speaks to American men in search of their own meaning and power within.A victory for Ukraine will be a victory for America.Thank you for bringing the lives of the gentle and strong Veselka family to us.Cathy Zadoretzky.",False
9,10,Amazing heart felt documentary!,charlesfbayer,n/a,17/08/2025,"An extremely touching documentary with multiple layers of endearing subjects, from Little Ukraine in NYC, to a wonderful family restaurant, to showing support for Ukraine. It moves from a general overview to a emotionally charged look at the lives changed by the Russian invasion. The documentary stands as an indepth look at the traumatic stress caused by war on those far from the battle lines through the emotional suffering of loved ones, and presents how human interaction and compassion can be the ultimate gift for those suffering from war inflicted trauma. Though the documentary does not look indepth at the Russian invasion of Ukraine directly, the viewer can feel the horror inflicted directly on those involved. A must see!",False
10,10,Amazing story everyone should hear!,wesleysf,n/a,17/08/2025,"It's amazing how much love a care a small place can contain. Stories like this one make believe that humanity isn't all that bad :)This documentary shows that the restaurants are not only about the delicious food and drinks, not only about having a distans culture on a plate but also about people, the way we interract and are able to achieve more when driven by the same things, desires.I was also astonished to hear about the amount of help Veselka is able to provide for Ukraine and Ukrainians in the States and back home. Important message that we can't afford to be lost behind political agendas and irrelevant info noise.Highly recommend!",False
11,10,Oscar worthy!,vickisalemi,n/a,17/08/2025,"This beautiful, heartfelt documentary by the talented director, producer, and writer Michael Fiore is, in a word, outstanding. The world needs this message more than ever: universal themes about resiliency, kindness, paying it forward, helping people, and cultivating an extended family/community. The captivating film will capture your heart, attention, and yes, stomach (note to self: need to visit Veselka in nyc!) The owners' and workers' journeys (and backstories) are incredible when you realize filming unfolded as the war in Ukraine emerged and the restaurant's family (and by that, I also mean workers since they consider their workers family) and the local community rallied. The film depicts Veselka as more than a restaurant -- it's an extended community with heart. And for the record, it's not a war movie. Au contraire: quintessentially, it's about humanity, strength, kindness, and ultimately, love.",False
12,10,Holy Pierogis! Fantastic doc.,tom-862-762738,n/a,17/08/2025,"Veselka is a warm, wonderful look at a beloved New York institution. A throwback to when a section of the East Village was known as Little Ukraine. How a Ukrainian immigrant family built a business over three generations that grew into an important cultural center. But it is not just nostalgia, The Ukraine War clearly dominates over the story. Still, Veselka manages to be surprisingly personal. We see how the stress of being from a country in crisis with family in danger weighed on the minds of these new immigrants. And how the children of previous immigrants were able to welcome them. Congrats to Michael Fiore for a fascinating look into the modern immigrant experience.",False
13,10,Blown away!,deedukes77,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is a must watch! Found it on Kanopy and had never heard of it. What a wondrous, beautiful and emotional ride. I loved every minute, including the story, the families, the love and the struggles. Strength, love and commitment intertwine the restaurant history, current events and the war in Ukraine. Beyond what little truth we learn from social media and the news, this movie breaks down a beautiful culture and teaches us more. The restaurant, the people and of course the FOOD bring it all together and connect everything. David Duchovny does a wonderful job narrating. I am a huge fan of this movie, the people, the story and the love. Watch it!",False
14,10,Veselka- a timely documentary; a must see,imdbfan-44445,n/a,17/08/2025,"I watched this twice already! It is a moving film that meshes a wonderful immigrant, family story with the sadness of the present realities of the Ukraine war today. Veselka the movie will make you inspired to be more involved in the NYC Ukraine community and want to go have a meal at one of the longest living NYC restaurants that has endured through so many changes of NYC. It is heartwarming and a tribute to the Birchard family for all they have done for the East Village, individuals and families. Veselka the movie takes you back in time and documents how the community started and what it is today. You will laugh and cry watching this movie.",False
15,10,I'm Hungry !,TarasM-1,n/a,17/08/2025,"What a wonderful documentary! Heart warming, tear invoking ! The color grading is so pleasant! The storyline resonated with me ! Made me think about every single Ukrainians story.On the other hand Eric Adams is the worst actor I've ever seen though ! Thumbs up to when they're saying "" schools getting bombed "" what a clown !I'm ready to go get some Varenyky and Borscht now ! Growing up in NY as a Ukrainian this really hit it home to explain how we have all been living for years!Jason is an angel ! Overall worth the watch, every minute brought me different feelings ! Vitaly should look into acting in other things now !",False
16,9,VESELKA serves up and celebrates family and community,johnjavakian,n/a,17/08/2025,"We need VESELKA more than ever. Both this documentary and the restaurant. This is the 70 year story of NYC's misted noted Ukrainian restaurant.This is an extremely heartwarming documentary. It strikes all the right chords. I felt educated AND entertained by it. I laughed and shed some tears.You don't just watch this documentary - you FEEL it.And I was very hungry by the end. While the food isn't the focus of the story (the people at the restaurant are) I really want some pierogis right now.I think I was most struck by how personal the movie is. It's not political at all. Though the appearance by embattled NYC Mayor Eric Adams cements how much of an idiot he is.I fell in love with the story, the subjects, the food, and everything in between.I streamed it on Prime. I am going to buy it on Apple TV now. This is one to own.",False
17,9,Labor of love that is essential.,yfyshfbjc,n/a,17/08/2025,Michael is one of the most talented directors in NYC.He puts so much passion and determination into it.All of his art is important and elevated.I have been living in New York City for approximately 18 years. On the east side of Manhattan. And I've been to Veselka more than a handful of times. And I never really understood the significance of the restaurant until now over the last couple years. I'm so happy they opened a new location in Greenpoint. I think that Space will do very well there.Overall. Michael is a true champion. I look forward to watching more from him as we move into this documentary- independent movement.,False
18,10,Wonderful documentary,imdbfan-7076428888,n/a,17/08/2025,"""Veselka: The Rainbow on the Corner at the Center of the World"" is one of the best documentaries I've seen this year. This heartfelt documentary captures the essence of humanity, resilience, and community through the iconic Ukrainian restaurant Veselka, which has been a staple in the East Village of NYC for decades.When the war breaks out in Ukraine, Veselka becomes more than just a restaurant. It becomes a symbol for hope, kindness, and unity in times of adversity.If you want to feel moved, inspired, and hungry, I highly recommend watching ""Veselka: The Rainbow on the Corner at the Center of the World.""",False
19,10,Heartfelt movie made with love,spitfirewench,n/a,17/08/2025,We attended a screening with the director in Charlotte. I was blown away by the stories he wove together and the threads of love and family running through it. The NY politicians in the credits? The movie isn't about them. It is about everyone who works in the restaurant and the ties to family running back across the world. I tend to hate movies and I loved this one. I felt the warmth and wanted the soup. It takes common elements to remind us what ties us together in these times when so much in the headlines points to our differences. I hope everyone goes to see this. It is such a gem and I'm so glad it came to my city.,False
20,10,"Inspirational Blue and Gold, Deserving of Every Accolade it Receives",jvilade,n/a,17/08/2025,"I recently had the pleasure of immersing myself in ""Veselka: The Rainbow on the Corner at the Center of the World,"" a documentary that resonated deeply. Michael Fiore's masterful direction painted a vivid tapestry of inspiration and cultural richness. The inclusion of jazz virtuoso David Sanborn's compositions was nothing short of sublime, seamlessly weaving through the narrative. David Duchovny's presence was skillfully utilized, propelling the story forward with finesse. Against the backdrop of lower Manhattan's streets and the iconic Veselka restaurant, Fiore delicately serves a feast of themes-family, community, hope, and love-each dish a testament to the human spirit. This timely and poignant journey is not just a film; it's a beacon of optimism, a reminder of the enduring power of humanity to uplift and unite. Heartfelt, authentic, and undeniably impactful, ""Veselka"" is a cinematic gem deserving of every accolade it receives. Inspirational blue and gold.",False
21,10,Unexpectedly poignant. A story about NYC and the world,imdbfan-69309,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThe director said that he wanted to tell a story about a father and son relationship. Which he did (and with a far lighter hand than most with such an ambition!). But that relationship turned out to be the launchpad for a much bigger story, a story that manages to be both global and local. Which is not a terrible way to describe NYC, actually, and Veselka's story is a quintessential New York immigrant success story.What they then did with their success may be the most quintessentially American manifestation of an immigrant success story: they used it to help others in need. Everything changed when Russia invaded Ukraine. The Birchards stepped up in a BIG way. An inspirational way.At it's core, it's still a story about 2 men, a father and a son, which makes their accomplishment all the more impressive. It serves as a great reminder that while none of us, individually, can change the world, everyone can contribute. Everyone can make a difference.I surely needed that reminder.",True
22,10,A must-see documentary that feeds the soul...,LinMovieLover,n/a,17/08/2025,"I rated VESELKA a 10 when I saw it the first time a little while back. I just saw it again and had to come back here to review it.If I could give it an ""11"", I would. But hats not hyperbole. The cinema landscape is filled with so many dark documentaries. This is a shining light. It is a story that is a true beacon of goodness, the way Veselka (the restaurant) is to New York City and the Ukrainian community.It's earnest, funny, dramatic (but not melodramatic), and much more. I laughed and cried (happy tears) both times I watched. Food is a part of the story, but is secondary to the 70 year human story at the restaurant. And I was fine with that. This isn't a Food Network show. This is a rich and meaningful documentary.You finish the movie feeling full and rewarded.I pray for the people of Ukraine and I am thankful for the wonderful people at Veselka that support Ukrainians near and far.",False
23,9,Must-see and feel character study in wartime,montybeans,n/a,17/08/2025,"The war in Ukraine is as ugly now as it was almost 4 years ago. ""Veselka"" isn't a war movie, but it shows the humanity of the New York City restaurant's owners and staff for Ukrainians both in the city and across the globe. The documentary starts as a historical piece that celebrates the start of the Ukrainian restaurant in NYC's East Village in 1954. It is opened by a Ukrainian refugee to be a place of support for all the displaced Ukrainians after World War 2. 70 years later his Grandson is given the keys post Covid and as the 2022 Russian-Ukraine war starts. The movie swiftly turns to a humanitarian story as the current owner becomes Oscar Schindler-esque and brings the family members of staff from Ukraine to the US. You feel his and his staff's pain, fear, joy, and everything in between. You leave the movie with so many feelings. Because the filmmaker so deftly made this a character study. In a world of true crime and sensationalism in documentary, this was a welcome addition to a short list of amazing and warm documentaries.",False

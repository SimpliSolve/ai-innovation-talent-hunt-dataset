1,7,No dire warnings here,georgewbeck,n/a,16/08/2025,Finally an animal documentary that doesn't have global warming at its core. Just a wonderful doco about a mother and her tiger cubs and their life in the jungle. Incredible filming and great heart warming story. The tiger cubs are a bundle of cuteness each with their own personality. You see them grow into adulthood and beyond. There is also a rival on the scene who gives you that sense of always possible danger. Life isn't easy in the jungle and although the tiger is king there is always danger from other predators. The changes of seasons from extreme heat to extreme rainfall shows how the tigers cope through the seasons. Great film for anyone who loves nature.,False
2,10,"Beautiful Footage, Wonderful Narration, Gorgeous & Elegant Creation Of GOD.",fakram17,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Tiger"" is a gripping and intense piece that tells the story of a young female Tiger's journey in raising her 4 little cute cubs. The episode is full of Tiger action, suspense, drama and beautiful landscape. The cinematography is stunning, and the music is catchy and well-timed. There is no stronger bond in animal kingdom than a bond between a mother and her cubs. The mother love reigns supreme.This series has some of the most beautiful footages of the King Of The Jungle. Loved every second of it, we need more of these beautiful documentaries. A Must Watch for all wildlife lovers like me.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5/5.",False
3,10,"A Mother's Might: A Review of ""Tiger'",vimvys,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Tiger"" is a documentary that transcends the typical wildlife documentry. It's not just a captivating look at a tigress raising her cubs, but a powerful tribute to India's remarkable tiger conservation efforts.The documentary shines in its portrayal of the tigress's journey. The filmmakers capture the gripping intensity of raising four cubs in the wild, from the tenderness of nurturing them to the fierce protectiveness a mother displays.But ""Tiger"" goes beyond the heartwarming moments. It cleverly weaves in the larger narrative of India's fight to save its tigers. The sheer improbability of a growing tiger population in the world's most populous country makes for a truly inspiring conservation story.The documentary's highlight seems to be a dramatic sequence, a moment of never-before-seen footage that promises to leave you on the edge of your seats.Overall, ""Tiger"" sounds is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates wildlife documentaries or stories of resilience and conservation success.",False
4,10,"Finally, a good documentary highlighting tigers in their natural habitats!",lexidietz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just a few months ago I was searching high & low for a documentary on Tigers in the wild. To my surprise, there was not nearly as many as there are with other big cats. If any good ones at all. The only ones I kept coming across, were series' that took place at a zoo and would only dedicate 1 episode to the tigers there. Not to mention, I'd much rather watch them in their natural habitat & learn about their true lifestyles, cubs, instincts, etc.Then I came across this and was soo excited when it popped up in my suggestions on Disney+. Finally, I didn't have to settle for another lion or leopard series/docu.It's a great watch!",False
5,n/a,Enhanced film of BBC old Tiger spy film; old clips made to appear new.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Disney regularly buys old films, enhances pic quality & re narrates / re scores them to stream as ""new."" A lie.This film is made from the original groundbreaking BBC Tiger Spy in the Jungle, filmed in early 2000, with Sir David @ height of his nature shows output & narration. 90 minutes of that old incredible gorgeous detailed Tiger film of super mom & 4 cubs was cut before its mass release from German co. Those old unseen 90 minutes are inserted here in this film. Entire BBC ""Spy"" Sir David series is excellent, capturing true natural behavior with many hidden cameras, & filmed when planet still had pristine areas packed with wildlife, unlike today. Series is on Prime.Here, India's tiger reserve has NOT looked like this in past 17 yrs due to bombardment of local tourism & more public interest. Sadly, still much ppl noise, extreme prolonged heat, extreme drought, draining of tigers reserve water stolen for farming, illegal livestock grazing daily in Tiger reserve, & ppl poaching tigers main prey & tigers themselves ALL contribute to less tigers, esp NOT breeding.Fact: Tigers need QUIET diverse rich ecosystems without ppl to survive. Tigers cannot be darted, transported to new area & expect to survive- many young adult tigers have died bc they need to master their environment, means YRS with Mom as mentor, Dad as protector, in their ""childhood to adult"" area.Trying to make this film hip by inserting modern songs is totally silly bc its nature, not rock concert.",False
6,10,"Out of the box, extra ordinary",nitinchandaliya,n/a,16/08/2025,"I must have watched this movie 5 times. I rarely like any movie but this one surely blows all my emotions.A pure documentary on tiger and how even the most fiercefull animal also needs survival in Jungle. The cuteness of cubs and their lineage.The narrative by Priyanka chopra is amazing. It's comedy, emotional, drama and real.",False
7,4,Not really a documentary,vgsbnb,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a beautiful film with great footage of tigers. The voice over work is also really good and relaxing, watching the film is almost like a mindfulness break.Maybe I should leave my expectations there because it doesn't feel very honest about the actual nature and behavior of the animal. Instead they project human reasoning and emotion onto the animals to create tell a story rather than document an animal.Feels like a sad road for nature documentary's to go down, for me as an adult who is interestin learning about the actual animal. But my kid loved it... but he's just happy to look at tigers.",False
8,2,"Good footage, lame stories.",cimex-15004,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI love tigers. They are brutal solitary animals which seem different from any other big cats in many cool ways.However, this show clearly just films some tigers and then places their own pathetic narrative over the top making it into some kind of lame .One of the biggest things they do, clearly the tiger cub Charm dies and it's all very upsetting, but they act like it's actually the other tiger who has died, and trying to pass of the tiger who survived as Charm, as it fits the narrative more nicely.Tigere really aren't all that emotional. The mother isnt not sharing food ""because she needs her cubs to leave so they escape from the baddie male tiger"", she literally sees them as big cats now and why should she share her food? She's saying - go and get your own. This is mine. That's how tigers are. They are not human.",True

This film will provoke you, maybe even shock you at times!That movie will grab you by the throat from the first second and let you go, only when you see the final credits.Highly recommend!""...because good things and serious changes are never made by the majority. These changes are made by very few people who know what they want.""

3,10,Ã…n incredible journey,veni-35940,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched the movie last night, and I am still under the impression that this was a magical documentary about the incredible journey of a young man, who was inspirational to all people that had interacted with him.The stories, as told by his classmates, his colleagues, his friends, his daughter, his Mom - they were all details in the bigger picture. And that bigger picture is a beautiful example of what kind of people there are. Not often, but every once in a while, there is someone like Mr. Takov seems like coming from another dimension or a different universe - one, where people are kind and gentle, nice and polite, with moral values where good is good, and bad can be turned into good, if there's rule of law.Mr. Takov indeed was a model for many of his students (me being one of them), with encyclopedic knowledge properly stored in his mind, but easily accessible - which he shared widely and freely with anyone willing to listen to him talking.The movie is with English subtitles, which makes it easy for non-Bulgarian speakers, and the translation is good.Please, watch it and share the positive emotions you inevitably will have after seeing it!His political activism, his interviews.",False
4,10,An emotional journey,ivana_stoyanova,n/a,16/08/2025,"A deeply moving story about a man with conviction, striving for justice.The personage of Christian Takov is revealed through interviews with people he was close to or acquainted with throughout his life. Their accounts of him paint the picture of a man with a goal. A man who had a vision for the future and the determination to set about making it a reality.From being a keen reader as a child, to writing his own books about the study of law, the documentary shows the audience Christian's personal development which led to him becoming a figure people looked up to.The documentary establishes Christian as someone to be studied, a life worthy of being portrayed on screen. He is emblematic in the way his views resonated with the people of Bulgaria, especially the youth.Clips never before seen by the public are included in the account of his life. They are embedded alongside the interviews, establishing Christian's status as a public figure. Adored by many, and an inspiration for us all.I strongly recommend watching ""Morality is Goodness"", a documentary that rouses the mind and grips the heart.",False

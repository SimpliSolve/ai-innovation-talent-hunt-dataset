1,2,Cringy self presentation and wasted potential,Ken_guru,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this movie because it was falsely advertised as a backpacking / work and travel documentation but it actually felt like a expecively produced video about a young post graduate spending his holyday in Australia. The only time he is wearing a backpack ist on the way from the airport.During the course of the entire film the guy is traveling by car and living with other ""backpackers"" in expensive looking hostels. At one time they even drive trough halve the country with two people in two separate cars.Chris presents himself as a adventurous guy but at no point in the movie he does anything alone. He clearly spends way more mone than he makes the few Time he is actually working. Ceveral times he tells the audience how broke he is dwelling in self pity but changes nothing about it and just keeps on traveling the same way spending money left and right. His low point seems to be when he has to eat ""cheap"" pizza and sleep in a ""cheaper"" hostel.Overall a underwhelming and uninspired documentation of a typicall young German trying to have the ""find youselfe"" experience.Two stars for the cinematic production.Chris obviously has more potential than is conveyed in the film and I hope he keeps making movies. Maybe he finds more meaningful content to show the world in the future.",False
2,10,awesome,hellou123,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary reminded me of my own travel experiences. I immediately felt the urge to travel and experience such moments.

3,3,The epitome of boring travel blogs,jan_nik1993,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film had the chance to show a different side of the ""finding yourself"" journeys countless young people embark on, with money, education and - most of all - time, most of which has been handed down to them.Instead it's an entitled view about backpacking that's been way too normalized in the middle-class of many developed countries.The disconnect is topped off by managing to sell the idea that you want to make a documentary about yourself. Three stars for the entrepreneurial spirit.",False

6,10,Backpacking explained,fabio-73108,n/a,16/08/2025,"The trailer alone makes you want more and when I was finally able to see the film, it left me speechless.
I myself was in Australia after my high school graduation and was able to experience similar life-changing things as Chris has experienced. Since then, a few years have passed and the trip to Australia should lay the foundation for my professional, as well as personal future.

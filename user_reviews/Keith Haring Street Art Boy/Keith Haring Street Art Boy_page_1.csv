1,7,Boy Wonder,Yohghurt,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was such an informative view life of Keith he was incredible and intimately kind. I liked his art work and his vision, his cause, style and representation. He died so young yet have impacted alot of artist these days. He was incredible.I wish he had lived but his legacy will last longer. He was such an inspiration to many youth and artist during his time. I believe somehow he was happy and he felt fulfilled with his work and legacy. The documentary was low key yet interesting and insightful in many ways. It still fascinating me to pull all of the archive photos and images. Its incredible.",False

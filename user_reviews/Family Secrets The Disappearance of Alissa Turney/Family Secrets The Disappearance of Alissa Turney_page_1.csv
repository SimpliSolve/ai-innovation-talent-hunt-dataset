1,10,Thank you for fighting for Alissa!,brookezirker,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWonderful but heartbreaking documentary. Sara does an amazing job at telling Alissa's story and not allowing the police or her dad silence her. She originally didn't believe her dad could do it, as they were raised so differently. It takes a lot of strength to examine the facts about a situation, and realizing the man that you were supporting was in fact, a monster. Her dad is a rambling narcissist but luckily videotapes everything, so there are endless pages of his rambling and gives insight into his state of mind and reveals how capable he is of manipulating and lying. I am so impressed by her strength and dedication to fighting for Alissa and refusing to give up.",True
2,4,Sad & unsatisfying story,kvxthzsbd,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile I admire Sarah Turney for her perseverance in doggedly trying to bring her father to justice for the murder of Alissa, this whole story was unsatisfying.Why wasn't Michael Turney ever interviewed by police? Why doesn't Sarah (or anyone else) ask Michael where the body is? Why on Earth would the DA's office bring murder charges against Michael Turney when they had no way of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt?Michael Turney is a mentally ill unabomber wannabe with his own silly manifesto & a van tricked out as a big bomb. He never actually carried out his grandiose fantasy of mass murdering members of an electrician's union. But he did sexually abuse his stepdaughter following the death of Alissa's mother. And he did likely murder her in order to keep her from outing him as a pedophile.The police investigation is just as amateurish as Sarah's own amateur investigation. Sad story. Botched investigation. Justice for Alissa will start by finding her remains.",True
3,10,Couldn't take my eyes off the screen!!,rosemolina,n/a,15/08/2025,"I stumbled upon this case ok TikTok and it intrigued me! It's extremely sad to see that it hasn't been solved yet, but we all know who committed this crime! Michael Turney isn't in jail unfortunately it's in gods hands now and he will do justice for Alissa's loved ones. Sarah's hard work and determination to get this story out is inspiring and so beautiful. At the end of the day the truth will always ALWAYS come out!!! No matter how much time has passed. Sarah turney you have done such an amazing job! I've seen how guilty you feel none of it was your fault love you were just a kid! Thank you for all that you do.",False

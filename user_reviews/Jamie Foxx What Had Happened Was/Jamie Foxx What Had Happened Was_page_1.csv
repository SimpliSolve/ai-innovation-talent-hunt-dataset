1,5,More self-aggrandizing than self-reflective,Shenoa-71754,n/a,15/08/2025,"This had its moments of brilliance, particularly in his trademark impressions, which showcased his undeniable talent as a performer. However, much of the show struggled to connect, bogged down by a tone that felt more self-aggrandizing than self-reflective.The repeated phrase ""...But I'm Jamie Foxx"" came across as overly self-important, as if he was leaning too heavily on his celebrity status to set himself apart from universal human experiences like health struggles and personal setbacks. Instead of inviting the audience into his world with humility or insight, this refrain felt alienating and, frankly, tiresome. It seemed to suggest he believed he was somehow immune to life's trials-or at least that his handling of them should inspire awe simply because of his fame.Beyond the hubris, some of his observations felt out of touch, as though they were crafted with an audience of peers rather than everyday viewers in mind. While Foxx's natural charisma and comedic timing still shone in spots, especially in the impressions, those moments were overshadowed by a number of cringeworthy missteps.Ultimately, the special had flashes of brilliance but was undermined by a tone that felt more focused on celebrating Foxx's persona than delivering relatable or truly incisive comedy. Fans of his will find things to enjoy, but many might walk away wishing for less hubris.",False
2,7,In my opinion...,jilmarie-ross,n/a,15/08/2025,"I appreciated that it wasn't a traditional stand-up comedy show-he blended impersonations, music, and footage from past projects, which I found refreshing and creative. I also understand and respect his gratitude for a second chance at life. However, I didn't care for the frequent use of the N-word, excessive profanity, and how talk about God was mixed in with it. I believe he could express the same messages without the profanity and the N-word. That said, I loved seeing his daughters as part of the show, and it was clear how genuinely thankful he is for his journey and the opportunity to live For Life.",False
3,6,To Be Expected,jennllm,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is not a comedy special. Jamie spends an hour explaining his health scare. It is obvious that this was a humbling experience. Rest assured, Jamie is the same funny and talented guy as he's always been. Jamie taps into his locker full of impressions to help him navigate the story. Some of his past roles are highlighted. You will see a lot of raw emotion throughout the special. He gives thanks to his family, God and the staff at Piedmont Hospital, in Atlanta, Georgia for helping him to get back on his feet. Both of his daughters make a special appearance. If you are a longtime Foxx fan then this is worth your watch.",False
4,7,Atlanta saved my life,d_penn,n/a,15/08/2025,"In April 2023, news broke that Jamie Foxx had been hospitalized in Atlanta with what his daughter described on Instagram as a ""medical complication."" Not much else was revealed, and in the vacuum of information, rumors spread. When a photo of Foxx appeared online, some conspiracy-minded types called it a clone. Katt Williams even jokingly questioned and made fun of his ""mysterious illness.""Now Foxx says he wants to set the record straight. Speaking in a theater a few hundred yards from the hospital where he says his life was saved, Foxx enters wearing sunglasses but takes them off quickly to wipe away tears. He says he experienced a brain bleed, suffered a stroke, temporarily lost the ability to walk and doesn't remember 20 days of his life. It's a moving performance that feels like part of a growing trend of how comics deal with medical catastrophe.",False
5,1,Yeesh,marthajdwyer-50044,n/a,15/08/2025,"That was the most insincere, crocodile tear filled special ever. I did not expect that from Jamie Foxx. I've seen better performances by him in music videos. So uncomfortable it was hard to watch. No ill-willed, monitizing-off-tragedy special would be complete without the audience pandering. (""Atlanta saved my life."" ""Atlanta knows how to show love and prayers."" Etc)I was expecting jokes and comedy, or even information, but he kept following up ""mystery illness"" with explaining it was a stroke. Ummm...hardly a mystery illness. I didn't laugh, didn't learn, didn't enjoy. Also, I'd love to see the stage notes for this special. It was so insincere I'd bet there were even notes of when to *pause for tears*, *stop here and get ""choked up""*Cringe from start to finish. Yeesh.",False
6,7,Very personal special,masonsaul,n/a,15/08/2025,"What Had Happened Was... is a slightly erratic and highly emotional special that addresses the biggest question straight away from the only perspective that really matters. It's Jamie Foxx setting the record straight in his own words in a deeply open fashion whilst still finding the time to get a few big laughs from what he's been through. His uncannily accurate impressions get time to shine and he spends so much of this special on the verge of tears which keeps it highly investing.The atmosphere of the special is pretty strong thanks to a really responsive crowd who are always on board with what Jamie does and there's some great reactions from them. The musical interludes are equal parts funny and emotional and they elicit big reactions from the crowd as does his sermon-like storytelling, culminating in a well deserved standing ovation to ensure this ends on a pretty big high to counterbalance most of the issues beforehand.",False
7,1,I didn't finish it,GhostReturns,n/a,15/08/2025,"It felt like he was doing a hour long confessional in an attempt to get some sympathy points. It definitely was a money grab. It was more of a sad unintesting church sermon that only the choir enjoyed. I stop about thirty five minutes in because I could not have stay around to watch another forty five minutes of him milking the public for money by stretching out his recovery story as far as he could stretch it. I tuned in for some funny jokes but only left feeling depressed. Additionally, the unnecessary low blows to p diddy and kat Williams didn't land for me. I felt the audience was only laughing to not hurt his feelings. Zero rating.",False
8,10,Blessed with joy and laughter,ythomas-03095,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jaime Foxx graces us with the joy of a pure artist who came through the other side of a serious illness and brings the laughter. Foxx understands his blessings and didn't disappoint by sharing this special comedy show. He's a quadruple threat who is actually very talented and rare: a comedian, actor, musician, and singer. His range of emotions is on full display. He is raw but still funny. I thoroughly enjoyed the show, laughing out loud and crying as if I was in the audience. Wishing Foxx only the best, a continued healthy journey, and success!The performance with your youngest daughter was beautiful.",False
9,6,Not my thing,lilianaoana,n/a,15/08/2025,"What happened was I had no idea what happened to Jamie Foxx so I thought to myself I didn't know Jamie Foxx did stand-up, and everybody was talking about this so I should check it out. Imagine expecting jokes and you get a confessional / testimonial of this guy's stroke journey, complete with gratitude and praising god. So I did not really resonate with this cause I don't really resonate all that much with Jamie Foxx and this discourse is clearly tailored to his black audience, and there are some funny bits here and there, I won't deny it, but not enough to keep me invested. I actually paused it straight in the middle weeks ago and finished it just now just for the sake of finishing it. This second part did have some funny stuff like the Denzel, Chappelle and the Trump impersonations (the last one was totally unexpected, but so, so good) and he ended it on a high with singing, so that was good. But not really worth my time if I'm honest. Not my thing.",False
10,2,Only for Foxx Fans,f-meyer83,n/a,15/08/2025,"I would say you love it or hate it.For me this is a bad show!Despite if what he experienced and I won't wish it to any other person.But this show is staged from the beginning to the end.If you're a fan or share his experience in your own way or in your family/friends, this might be something for you.I lost an hour of lifetime with this show.Because when you start you think it's a documentary, then he enters the stage and starts to talk and makes jokes. Then comes music and a lot of god-related talk.But it's neither standup, music nor a documentary...it's a mixture of everything and isn't good in any of this parts.",False
11,10,Jamie's Celebration of Life,avakay-98287,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jamie celebrates life with family and fans after a near fatal stroke. He worked hard to make it back. Yes he talks about himself alot but that's OK. So glad he is still here. Love that he brought back his old characters...Wanda and Ray especially. Glad he and his daughter performed together as that was always her wish. This stand up was much more than comedy...it was poignant and tearful at times. But the big laughs were there and Jamie is an amazingly talented man. His ability to do impressions of other stars and politicians is uncanny. He is so good with
recreating their voices and gestures. Welcome back Jamie!",False
12,6,Jamie Foxx Turns Scary Tragedy into Fun Testimony Special,sammyadelaiye,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jamie Foxx is a natural storyteller, and this shines through in his retelling of his health scare. Though he recounts a frightening and emotional experience, he skillfully lightens the mood with humor, cracking jokes about his time in the hospital and his interactions with the medical staff.This balance between comedy and vulnerability creates an uneven but engaging experience. One moment, Foxx is on the verge of tears, and the next, he's delivering expletive-filled jokes that leave the audience laughing.At its core, this is a testament to his gratitude-for life, for a second chance, and for the people who supported him through the ordeal. While it's not a traditional stand-up special, it's an entertaining and heartfelt reflection on survival, resilience, and appreciation.",False
13,3,As far as from a comedy special as you can get,DrDemento789,n/a,15/08/2025,I thought the first 15 maybe 20 at the most would be him explaining his story and move on with a bit of Jokes talking about his new movie or even anything other than himself but nope just a solid hour of Me me me and black pandering to God and the Audience. If he wasn't a clone before I would definitely see him more so now. Should not even be labeled as a comedy its more like a Documentary first then maybe a Gospel. Wow this is bad I literally fell asleep and flipped through today to see if I missed anything but nope. Just a man crying for an hour straight and tanking god for his survival while the Audience preaches on.,False
14,7,"Not what I expected! More than a ""stand up comedy""",colleenmwold,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had no idea what I was getting into. I don't know that this should be categorized as a ""stand up comedy"" special.While it was funny at times, it was also sad, yet uplifting listening to what he went through. I honestly had no idea this even happened to him. My head must have been in the sand or something.I don't think it's as terrible as some people are rating it. It's just unexpected and what I can agree on is that it was a little ""preachy"" at times. I don't judge those feelings, beliefs, or thoughts, but it was a little heavy on that for me personally. We just skipped ahead a tiny bit if it got to be too much.It was definitely interesting and if you like him it's definitely worth a watch.",False
15,1,The worst 'comedy' special I've ever seen,juliaw-66817,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've never written a review before but... This special was so terrible... The world should be talking about it.Jamie Fox has an ego bigger than God, and he mentions God A LOT. It was more like a Sermon about Jamie Fox, written and produced by Jamie Fox.He throws in some jokes but they are really lame and not funny at all. I think you would need to be a Jamie Fox superfan to enjoy this, or a Jesus superfan.. or an Atlanta superfan.I mean everyone is glad he didn't die but he acts like he is too special of a person to have suffered a stroke. It also felt strangely ingenuine and like a play performance even though is supposed to be straight from the heart. I just don't get it.",False
16,7,A fun return under unique circumstances,ta-98251,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jamie Foxx's new comedy special is unlike any you've seen before.Foxx is back on stage after a mystery illness that almost cost him his life. In this one hour special Fox takes on a journey of what happened and gives praise to god and his family who stood by home the whole time.Foxx also addresses several of the rumours that have arisen in his absence including Diddy got him and that he is a clone. He showcases his talents in comedy, impersonations, acting, singing and piano to remind that it's impossible to clone Jamie Foxx because nobody can do it quite like him.This is a funny, heartfelt, emotional and reflective comedy special that had audiences laughing and crying in equal measures.",False
17,2,Wow is this bad!,allanjim3,n/a,15/08/2025,"I wanted to tune out after about 15 minutes but I let it go on longer to see if it would get better. Sadly it did not.This isn't standup comedy, this is a theatrical production by a first class actor. The amount of pandering to the primarily black audience is off the charts.Don't get me wrong, Jamie Foxx is incredibly talented, but the direction he takes this time does a not strike a chord. Instead it is cringe-worthy and so overly-performative you have to (almost) see it to believe it. Before you waste your time, I suggest you watch one of his fantastic movies or perhaps listen to some of his music. Perhaps this will leave you with a better taste in your mouth.",False
18,10,Jamie Foxx speaking his truth,Stew-Alexander,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerBeautiful, not much a typical comedy but a divine comedy, a man speaking his truth after being humbled by a stroke that almost killed him.Had a friend who had a stroke last year, was in a coma for about a month. He's walking now but just like Jamie it changed himJamie talked about how he suddenly had to rely on the kindness of strangers and his family; that like me, when I couldn't walk due to an illness, had to let go of the egoJamie expressed his overflowing gratitude to his fans, his family, his doctors and support staff for their care and prayers, how it's a bit embarrassing being vulnerable - the real takeaway, like me after getting through my stuff, is just how truly lovely it is to be aliveMost stuff is just rocks, gas and liquids in our universe, it's remarkable to be alive - we all go through some serious stuff being alive but life is like a chiaroscuro (light & dark) Rembrandt-like painting. Plenty of darks but there's light too, and colors and beauty, such beauty; life is a work of art, truly is.Needed to put this out here as I went through some stuff too, and all the bad reviews from a bit jaded people expecting a typical standup don't realize how funny it is to be walking around worrying like we do.Like Bob Marley so gracefully sang in his song ""3 Little Birds"", ""Don't worry about a thing 'Cause every little thing gonna be alright""Thanks Jamie for sharing your truth, loved this ...",True
19,6,A Talented Man but...,daisyjonessf,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI turned the show off right after he discovered his manhood was still working after he got a hug from a very beautiful Hollywood actress. Good for him!There were a lot of ""praise Jesus"" moments. I get it. At a relatively young age, this powerhouse entertainer had a stroke, and it took something like a year to recover. He almost died. That would be hard on anyone. I am sure he never actually for one moment thought that his celebrity status would in any way come between him and his unfortunate health condition. I wish he hadn't attempted to portray otherwise.But...there wasn't much comedy. Certainly no new ground was covered. And it was a little embarrassing.This was not the time or place to showcase his daughter's guitar playing talent. Even if she did bring his blood pressure down.It all felt very uneven, badly, if at all, written.I am glad he recovered. I'm a fan of his many talents. Unfortunately this appearance was literally to explain what he went through. If you look at it from that perspective, you won't be disappointed.",True
20,2,"Mostly a sermon, some funny",jdixfam,n/a,15/08/2025,"Was not surprised this was more of a ""telling"" than a stand up special. However I was surprised how heavy handed it was in its telling. Obviously a humbling experience for him and tragic. But he was laying it on thick, making me wonder at times how authentic he was. Around 30min in, he then pretty much broke straight into explaining the Christian gospel through a retelling of a conversation he had with god. At that point, it was very clear I was in the middle of a church service. Turned it off. I've been to church before. I think Netflix did it a disservice listing it as a comedy special. If Jamie wants to become TD Jakes that's cool with me. It's just not what I expected...or wanted. To each his own.",False
21,9,Jamie's back and stronger than ever!,starling001,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed this-it was raw, emotional, and deeply personal. Jamie shared his truth and testimony in such a powerful way, taking us through a deeply challenging and frightening time in his life. I laughed, cried, and cheered as he recounted his journey and how his faith in God carried him through. A standout moment was when he sang while his daughter played guitar, a truly beautiful and heartfelt scene. His reflections on his career, accomplishments, and the importance of family added so much depth, making the story not only relatable but also incredibly moving. It's an unforgettable and inspiring account.",False
22,7,What Happened Was,IceCream-57,n/a,15/08/2025,I thought this was overall good. It took me a bit to understand the flow of the show but when it was all said and done I enjoyed it. Jamie Foxx suffered a medical emergency and his family helped him through it by staying by his side and being supportive. He seems to be very grateful for that. This is a good show to watch.,False
23,1,Not very funny,ke_we-57756,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLet's start with the good.Glad to see Jamie is physically alright. He's been in a few of my favorite movies and hoping he comes out with more future classics. The part where he does the impressions is pretty funny and Jamie's musical talents are pretty impressive. From a Christian perspective, I love the fact that Jamie didn't just mention ""God"" but multiple times evoked Jesus name.Unfortunately the bad.The reason most people tuned into this is because it was billed as a Diddy did it, and there were many podcasts saying what he said from people that were there, then he touched on that as a joke and it wasn't Diddy. Much of the show seemed to be pre planned drama, as noticeable by the finger snap change of screen, and on screen duo with his daughter (although she was good). Just seemed like a Netflix money grab around the mystery illness (stroke).But the part that bothered me most is also from a Christian perspective. To people that this will offend - Sorry folks, but if you're going to make the show so based around God, then you shouldn't be surprised by a religious perspective.After a near death experience that Jamie says many times how thankful he was for a second chance, and how humbled he was because of it. I don't understand how you could in the same show be so self aggrandizing - it just didn't come across as humble at all. And the number one kicker for me, I really don't understand how in the same show you invoke Jesus name on multiple occasions, that you can also blaspheme him so many times. Im not trying to judge - got my own problems. But ive been waiting a long time for some actor to stand up and say enough with this in their Hollywood scripts and shows, as many times it's so incredibly intentional and unnecessary,",True
24,3,"""Woe is Me""",gideontiberius,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a RN, I am empathetic to any patient that suffers from an acute event, such as a stroke, MI, etc. However, most of these events can be prevented.Don't get me wrong, it is beneficial for the individual to believe in something. Whether it be a higher power (God) or family, etc. However, religion will not cure you. Foxx speaks endlessly about how God rehabilitated him, but also asks continuously ""Why me?"". ""Jamie Foxx don't get strokes.""Well Jamie, God didn't rehabilitate you, the doctors, nurses and ancillary staff did! This was the perfect opportunity to show the under appreciated nurses some serious love! However, you simply chose to classify them as ""butt wipers"". His sister had no idea where the hospitals were, which shows how out of touch celebrities are with healthcare. If they hadn't entered the hospital I guarantee religion would have done nothing for him without the tremendous medical care he received.""Jamie Foxx don't get strokes."". Really? Your body doesn't care who you are or how rich you are. Clearly, you had unchecked risk factors (i.e. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, etc.) and you left them untreated. Instead of using this special as a platform for stroke awareness and the importance of our shrinking number of underpaid medical professionals in this country, you chose to show the viewers your resume, wealth and denial of your health.Millions of patients go through the same thing Foxx did everyday and most of them don't have the benefit of wealth, extensive rehab or even family to help them through. A comedy special about his ego-stroking, health unawareness and narcissism is not what we need.",False
25,1,The Only Mystery Illness Was The Amnesia,ThatMonkey,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAs someone with health issues, I know the value in PHI, Protected Health Information. My business, is just that. Had Jamie or in this case his family said it's a private matter and we'll speak when we're comfortable. I would have respected that, but they lied, said he was fine, ok, even playing pickelball all while he couldn't even bath himself.And the real kick is once he found a way to monetize his Mystery Illness, he cashed that check.There was a lot of emotion and crying and I question how much was legit and how much was to sell the story, at one point there is a musical act, that was clearly rehearsed that they clearly want you to beliebe was impromtu.I didn't laugh, even though he tried to be funny, I found myself less than interested and less than trusting in the limited facts that he shared,This was sold on being P Diddy adjacent and even though Diddy was mentioned, it wasn't in lieu of the illness.Jamie also appears to be uncomfortable with his perceived height, cause the soles on those shoes were 2 inches thick and he still looked like a below average height man.When you come, come real. This who thing was fake to me.",True

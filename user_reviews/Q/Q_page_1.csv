1,10,This film stays with you,mahl-48418,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first saw this film. In general I prefer indie films to other genres. I like a slow pace. I like to have something to think about and discuss after a film. I like to really get to know the characters and feel their emotions. I like beautiful visuals and soundtracks. Q gave me all of these things. The story is so deep and layered.Hiba is so multifaceted and riveting as a main character. She shows such vulnerability and raw humanity in the film that only her own daughter, Jude Chehab, as director could have accessed. Ziad Chehab is stoic yet complex. Teta is eccentric and contradictory. Do yourself a favour and watch this film.",False
2,10,One of my favorite documentaries,miracoqui,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary touched me profoundly as it dives in a very unconventional way into the intimacy of a family and their spiritual journey. It deals with the complexity of feelings in a most natural and spontaneous way. I cried, i laughed and in between i enjoyed a very well done documentary artistically. Despite what the images might show you will discover a very brave and uncomformist family that would break all the built stereotypes you have about veiled muslim women. And that was so refreshing for me to experience while watching Jude's journey into her mom's hidden and non hidden layers of herself.",False
3,9,"Powerful exploration of faith, community, and ex-communication",manalmoukaddem,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI had the privilege of watching Q in July, and it has since stayed with me. Jude Chehab, who is not only the director and filmmaker, but is the subject's daughter, reveals delicately to the audience the joys and pains of faith, community, and ex-communication as experienced by her mother. Although the documentary treads into the secretive and mysterious world of the Qubaysiyat; an underground collective of Muslim women which was founded in Syria in the 1970s, it is her mother's relationship with this group, and in particular its matriarch, which holds center stage. The themes are simultaneously particular to the context of the documentary yet wholly universal: when identity and community meet our need for belonging and love, what happens when it also holds us hostage? And when we break free, are we liberated, heartbroken - or both?",True

1,6,Highly Speculative,michaelgemaly,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wanted to rate it 5 but it wouldnt let me. I beleive in the rapture. Have for years. When I saw this it blew me away. I shared with others. I bought the $100 decoding the future DVD set of the person they received the information from.Then I started looking for supportive information. I even contacted other biblical archeological professors of galilee. No one has heard of the information that was shared about weddings in ancient Galilee. So its a great movie, but so creative and speculative you cant say is its true without back up refrences. None are given.",False
2,8,An Important film for Muslims,hasanmahmood1994,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel the director has inadvertently made a film that gives more evidence for Islam than it does Christianity.Islam teaches towards the end of times, Jesus will return. This film doesn't show evidence for Christianity, as it misses the one key issue that divides Christians and Muslim... The fact Jesus was the son of God, not a Prophet sent from God.The Prophet Muhammad foretold of these signs and even when it to greater depth... Eg 'there will be a time when the Bedouins compete with who can build the tallest buildings'.I still think it's an important documentary for people of faith.",False
3,9,Great documentary,angelodeieso,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love the fact that Jack Hibbs was in this movie. Great documentary about the return of Jesus Christ. Matthew and Revelation reveals this in the good book. This film answers a lot of questions surrounding the end of days to come, and why Jesus use certain languages and parables to foresee his return to earth after his crucifixion and resurrection. Highly recommend it to anyone who is a Christian and even if you are not a Christian, this documentary explains a lot about the New Testament, and even the old testament. Great editing, and cinematography. The narration was excellent as well. Don't mess up on checking this one out if you love Jesus or interested in learning more about Him.",False
4,n/a,Excellent,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've known about the parallel between the Jewish wedding tradition and the return of Jesus Christ for most of my life.The church, after all, is called the bride of Christ and if you take the time to examine scripture and Jewish tradition, the truth becomes crystal clear.The rapture was not ""invented"" in the 1800's by John Darby. The rapture is clearly shown in both the Old and New Testaments but there are many who want to make the Scriptures irrelevant and mythical.Open your heart and mind and He will show you how incredible this is.Jesus will return for His bride. He said ""I go to prepare a place for you and I will receive you to myself that where I am, you may be also.""It was common Jewish wedding tradition that the groom would leave his promised bride and go to his fathers house to prepare a place for them both and the wedding and feast. When the place was ready, the groom would send for the bride who would meet him half way and they would go to his prepared place.A perfect picture of the rapture and the feast spoken of in the book of the Revelation.This is the reason we watch for Him.",False
5,10,This was better than I expected,sateigdraleah,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a great watch. Really encouraging and it reminds us of what our focus should be on as believers. Our Lord is coming back. Definitely worth the watch and definitely worth sharing and recommending to others.,False
6,10,Mindblown!,gilltojesus,n/a,16/08/2025,"I consider myself opened to end-time revelations, but this is just AMAZING!How Jesus uses parables so profound to his disciples at that time, is now revealed, gives me chills. And the message is clear...
Show this movie to your loved ones and people you care and let them be in love with Jesus as he come back for his bride. This movie is all about Gods love for us.MUST-SEE!",False
7,1,ABSOLUTE BS,MJ74582,n/a,16/08/2025,"IF false advertisement does not qualify as a sin, then why did man make laws to prevent such?? Being the curious individual that I am, I just HAD to pay the $6.99, to see the ""new ANTHROPOLOGIC"" evidence that was purported in the trailer; hoping that there would be some PROOF, as is also touted. Yet ALAS, I too fell victim to semantics. While they do present a skull or two, in the trailer, to lure you down the rabbit hole, there is not even a resemblance of EVIDENCE, anywhere in the whole ""blessed"" thing!!! SO, If you would like to sit through an 84 minute ""Hollywoodized"" sermon on the Rapture, then this is the movie for you.",False
8,10,Excellent!,charleston399,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching this with my family last night, I truly understand what Jesus referred to when discussing His second coming. I used to be scared and fearful, like so many believers, because I didn't understand the language. This put it all into perspective and I am now truly excited and understand the rapture! Thank you, thank you for making this!",False
9,7,Love it!,duggies70,n/a,16/08/2025,"Where to begin; possibly the best hour and a half I've spent in ages. I hope it will inspire many. Those that merely need more support this will do it. I hope it will inspire others to study the word, not to read. Verify what people tell you with your own study. I also hope it will help return those that have fallen away.It provides a way of looking at Christs ministry from a point I'd never heard. The ideas are placed with logic and an understanding of the culture of the time. As the world pushes away faith hopefully it we'll help draw us back.It was well worth your time, besides how can an hour and a half hurt.",False
10,10,Must watch,Dblohsevn,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm so glad I bought this without knowing much about it. It is a compelling and well constructed presentation of the importance of the return of Jesus and why Christians need to take it seriously today,False
11,1,No what I expected,rosa_2002,n/a,16/08/2025,"They said they have proof, I watched the documentary thinking they were going to show some proof. There was none. The documentary was based on a 2,000 year old wedding tradition in Isarel. The wedding scene proof nothing to me at all.",False
12,n/a,A revelation inside a revelation...,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before the Wrath is a tremendous and timely documentary-Brent Miller, Jr. is a fantastic film maker, and this is his best by far. The message is powerful, perfectly timed for a chaotic world that's lost its way, and a shining encouragement for a church that has drifted from its 'hope of glory'. Beautifully shot, well-paced and brimming with solid content. Mind blown and blessed--a must-see.",False
13,10,Excellent!!!,jpyramjd,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie forced a simple process of critical thinking, and looking at the obvious, the culture of the time and place.A simple event that I've read a thousand times and never ponder on me that it was being used as a metaphor.Start asking the question Why Jesus is coming back. Read the prophecies in your Bible now. This movie encourages to back and read your word.Theirs also a message to Pastors, more like a warning.I'm going back to watch this Director's other movies. And wish the movie was a ongoing series.Go watch it as a family, great for kids especially your teens and warn all your friends and family.",False
14,10,Please Don't Miss This Movie!!,simonandme,n/a,16/08/2025,So Biblically Sound! Makes perfect sense as I compare to the Bible. Just as God the Father closed the door to Noah's ark. God the Father of Jesus will one day close the door to The Wedding Supper of the Lamb!! He loves us enough to wait for us! I loved this movie and reccomend it to Everyone!!,False
15,10,Very well done,nancyhotz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really would only recommend this to Christians or those who have some knowledge of the Bible, or it won't make sense. If you are wondering why the second coming is going to be a real event and WHY it's important, watch this and then read your Bible.",False
16,1,A way to explain away previous prophecies that came to nothing,davegaffney-674-281787,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie seeks to rewrite history and prophecies made. A prophecy that does not materialise cannot be categorised as anything other than a non-event. It does not entitle people to try to explain why it didn't happen and why it is still apparently a possibility. It was stated to be a very specific event at a very specific point in time. It never happened. Simple as that. I am a Catholic by birth but this narrative is pure fiction, not unlike that of God himself.",False
17,10,This film should be free for all audiences to view.,Timekeeper1,n/a,16/08/2025,Great film. What you see in the trailer is what you will learn from this film. This film should be free for all audiences to view. I get it cost money to produce but not a penny needs to be made to share these revelations with the world. To lose money or to lose a soul should be the question?.,False
18,1,mistranslation of the bible repeated over and over then the sheeple believe it,handydan-64130,n/a,16/08/2025,"The ""rapture"" was invented by man in the early 1800's, because he just couldn't wrap his head around the bizarre wording of Revelation, and so added a demonic agenda, to lead the sheep astray. Isaiah chapters 24 and 34, 2 Peter chapters 2 and 3 Matthew chapters 24 and 25 should help explain the mysteries that cloud the thoughts while reading Revelation. If God didn't cut the tribulations short, no flesh would survive. Are you one of the 144,000,(that no man can count){just think of 1st century man and how high he could count} the white robed who were washed in blood and who God awoke and who stood at the foot of the alter? The ""remnant"". Faith without works is dead. No one is going to be whisked away in some secret ""rapture"". ALL of the tribulations required the patient endurance of the Saints. Are you, do you think you are above the Saints?",False
19,10,Very Biblical,mic_helle-64224,n/a,16/08/2025,I love Bible! This movie represents it!You need to test your faith either you are the genuine follower of Christ or not.,False
20,1,So... ????,leesymiziris,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThey told us NOTHING AT ALL! Regurgitating Christian beliefs. Comparing Galilean wedding to the coming of Christ wedding. And the evidence? Or are we to believe and not question? What was the point of all of this?,True
21,10,Very good,FARight63,n/a,16/08/2025,This really is a thinker as to self-evaluation. Is my relationship with Jesus as it should be for a bride to her Groom.,False
22,10,AMAZING!,uknycdt,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary is truth and amazing detail of how the marriage back then relates to Jesus parables and how important every detail is!,False
23,10,A movie with a critical message,providencehub,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie provides a deep critique of Christian faith today, one which has lost the value of prophecy (although that forms 1/3 of bible scriptures) due to the controversial teachings of 'day-setters', people who had claimed to know exactly when the Jesus' Second Coming would be.Hence, although the prophecy of Jesus' second coming is absolutely fundamental to Christian faith and the most significant promise, few Christians today know properly about the rapture, much less look forward to His coming.This movie unravels the context behind Jesus' teachings, given his Galilean background, and points starkly to the fact that Jesus was squarely referring to Him coming back as the bridegroom with believers as his bride, because he used numerous parables from the galilean wedding, which his disciples understood very well.",True
24,n/a,Should be called Theology Lost,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anyone who believes the rapture is a future event, simply doesn't understand the Bible and is calling Jesus a liar. Jesus was speaking of it to the people then as a future event. He was telling them that judgment was coming on Israel for the culmination of sins that they and their fathers were guilty of, and ending with their complete rejection and killing of God's Son. He even said some of them would see it with their own eyes.That judgment took place in 75 A.D. when Rome completely destroyed Israel. The rapture, were the Christians at that time who saw the army on the hill and believed in what Jesus said and then fled, while the Roman army held back for three days.Now, the only remaining prophecy is that Christianity will spread over all the earth. Not until every tongue confesses and every knee bows, will Christ return. Probably thousands of more years, but all in God's time.",False
25,9,Great movie for understanding a certain aspect of the Bible!,Manuel-Hoerth,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know what some people expect. Well I guess the movie does kinda hurt itself by promising some new and big archeological discovery which it doesn't deliver. Because it doesn't really reveal anything new, but just something that people in the past all knew but most people today don't understand anymore.And I have to admit I didn't know all of what the movie mentioned either. So if you are simply looking for a movie that provides you with some additional background information that isn't really new, but that you probably didn't know, then this movie does deliver. Because it really does help you to understand the Bible better.Of course if you are not interested in understanding the Bible better, then you better skip this movie, because that's all it does. But if that's what you are interested in, it's a great movie!",False

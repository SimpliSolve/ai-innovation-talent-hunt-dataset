1,9,A brilliant documentary,thomasbool,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Very good film and all the cast come across well.
Beno Obano comes across as a very thoughtful and intelligent man.Ellis Genge is supremely talented, a future lion and it's refreshing to see that boys from different races and backgrounds are finally get there chance.My only slight criticism would be it's very England centric where as in Wales, rugby is very much a working class sport.But this a very slight criticism as the boys can only talk about there own experiences.All in all a brilliant documentary and worth a must watch.Well done all involved.",False
2,2,Confusing and disappointing,LaDanet,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler1- doc starts highlighting Britain has 14% of people in black and other minorities. We hear all along how the sport not making enough space for them because e.g private schools access. Yet the doc ends up mentioning 35% of the elite rugby (English national team) is made of people of colour.2- it's England centric. Although the « elite » stamp is relevant in other parts of the world, it's ignoring places like south-west France, NZ, and many more
3- the money argument at the end of the doc is so far from the spirit of rugby, it's heartbreaking to hear. There are interviews and documentaries that I feel are much more positive and inspiring, outlining values of solidarity, respect, humility, courage.",True

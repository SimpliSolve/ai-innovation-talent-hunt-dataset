1,8,"Grateful for the captions, the pause button, and Wikipedia.",rebekahrox,n/a,15/08/2025,"I started watching this out of curiosity and to say I have seen it, being the cultural touchstone that it is. At first, I was a little detached, not liking the songs too much, and thinking I would probably just skip through to end in a minute. I couldn't stop watching and it really sucked me in. I have to say, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it at all, live in the theater. I benefited greatly from the captions and the ability to put it on pause to consult Wikipedia from time to time. The lyrics were so clever and really told the story. I ended up very moved and almost cheering at the end. Of course, now that I am familiar with the story, I would love to see it live and would enjoy it immensely. But I would strongly recommend this for a first time viewing. I will definitely re-watch. And probably again and again.",False
2,9,just superb,ferguson-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. You know what it's like when people start talking about some great new restaurant that just opened (think back to pre-pandemic)? And then you start to hear your friends and co-workers raving about it ... best 'steamed broccoli' (ok, insert your favorite entr√©e) I've ever tasted! Having been burned many times with high expectations, you remain skeptical, but make the reservation. Well, that's been me with ""Hamilton."" For almost 5 years, the hype was just too much. Surely folks were caught up in the frenzy, and peer pressure was such that no one would admit it wasn't all that. So, now I'm here ... throwing myself at the mercy of the Theater Gods. Thanks to Disney Plus, I only needed to invest a little (ok, a lot) of time, rather than a few hundred dollars for a ticket. This is me humbly admitting I was wrong. The show is fantastic, and I only wish my first viewing had been a live performance.Unfortunately (because of what I mentioned above) this can't be a comparison of a live stage performance and the film version. Instead, this will briefly outline what I noticed in the movie. First, and I believe this is key, the original stage director Thomas Kail is back to direct the film. It should be noted that the film version is a blend of a couple of recorded live shows, plus some recorded songs seamlessly edited in. This is the original cast doing what they do best, and the edits are imperceptible. Second, the main cast is filled with dynamic performers. In many stage shows, one or two actors are head and shoulders above the others. Not so here. At a minimum the top seven actors are as skilled and fun to watch as any you've seen. Third, this is a true musical in that the songs drive the story. Some of the early songs require serious concentration to catch the lines, but even if you miss some lyrics, the gist of what's happening is pretty clear. These aren't so much catchy sing-along types, but you'll easily recall the scenes when you hear the songs again at a later date. We see a perfect melding of music-performance-story.Of course most everyone knows that Lin-Manuel Miranda is the creative force behind the show. He credits writer Ron Chernow's book on Alexander Hamilton as the inspiration for the production, but it's Mr. Miranda that appeared on every talk show for a couple of years, and he also performs as Alexander Hamilton. Daveed Diggs has dual roles as the flamboyant Marquis de Lafayette and the equally flamboyant (at least here) Thomas Jefferson. Renee Elise Goldsberry takes over the stage with her powerful voice as Angelica Schuyler, and Chris Jackson is a dominating physical presence as George Washington. Jonathan Groff (from ""Mindhunter"") is absolutely hysterical and unforgettable as King George III, both through song and strut. Everyone will have their favorite performers, and truly they are all exceptional, and I'd like to point out the two that took my breath away. Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton has a pristine voice that will bring tears to many eyes. She may not be as involved with the political elements of the story, but in the most emotional moments, she is front and center. Lastly, the passion Leslie Odom Jr brings to his role as Adam Burr is beyond description. He may be the ""villain"", but he makes Burr accessible and easy to understand ... plus Odom is a terrific singer and performer, and he lights up the stage.It's easy to overlook the dance and stage choreography since it's never over-the-top, but the dancers are terrific and the performers make great use of the single set - although props are regularly brought in and taken away. Perhaps what really makes this click as movie entertainment is the expert use of cameras and editing. We see the full stage when we should, and we are offered close-ups when it's most effective. I do hope to catch the live show at some point, but if my Hamilton experience is limited to this cinematic version, well ... ""that would be enough.""",False
3,9,A great musical!,clovenier-927-957545,n/a,15/08/2025,"Who tells your story? Who tells my story? Talk less, smile more. Tonight I saw the musical Hamilton (2020) on Disney+. To begin with let me tell you I do know a little about the founding fathers of America, but not the story of Hamilton (1) and I am not an American, but born and raise in The Netherlands (2). And before I say more, the musical is just great.I like all the players, the costumes, the dance and the songs. When you ask me who of the five players you like best I would say Lin-Manuel Miranda as Hamilton, Daveed Diggs as Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson, Ren√©e Elise Goldsberry as Angelica Schuyler, Jonathan Groff as King George (such a great performance!) and Chris Jackson as George Washington. Offcourse a great compliment for Miranda, who was also responsible for the story and music; he also was one of the producers.There where great scenes and songs throughout. I find the hip-hop awesome from the beginning to the end. As a not-American I had a little time to adjust, but with the capital on a little time. With the first song going I became fascinated. Okay yes, the best enjoyment would be to have been there live. Never the less, seeing it on your television has also positive things for it to say. Some scenes you can see from a different angle and you get some fine close-ups. To end, as said, a great musical I enjoyed very much.",False
4,10,This is how musicals should be done for screen,sebastianbrown-00139,n/a,15/08/2025,Although many musical adaptations have flopped this may have proved that best way to do it is simply film the play.

This is a beautiful shot of the great spectacle Hamilton is, the flawless music of Lin Manuel Miranda, the production, the photography, costumes.

6,10,Next best thing to live,jenniferleroux,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've been lucky enough to catch the show on tour in Minneapolis and it was amazing. As another reviewer said, this is how all Broadway productions should be released - not all Hollywood stylized - but a live filmed production of the original cast before an audience. About as close to perfection as you can get it.",False
7,10,History is Cool,olihist,n/a,15/08/2025,"Anyone who has ever taught History or even studied it will tell you that the most common complaint that they get from people is that ""History is Boring.""But after you finish watching this beautifully filmed version of the acclaimed musical ""Hamilton,"" you will no longer be thinking that.History can be ""cool"" and educational at the same time.There are powerful lessons from the story of Alexander Hamilton that are more than relevant to today's world. But like so many other historical subjects, Hamilton feels disconnected from our world of today. He's another one of these ""old white guys"" that we have to read in a textbook, another one of those ""old white guys"" frozen onto a painting, a statue, or a dollar bill.But what ""Hamilton"" does so well is to take the essential elements of Alexander Hamilton and retell his story - including a number of lesser known characters - for a contemporary audience in ways that they can more easily connect to.There is of course also a political undercurrent, but instead of overshadowing the story, it helps underline its most timeless elements, whether it's race, gender, or wealth.Like many who have already posted reviews, I am not a huge fan of musicals, especially film adaptations of musicals, and especially historical musicals. Most of these tend to be soapy and shallow, full of stereotypes and inaccuracies that only hinder rather than aid the histories taught in books and/or the classroomBut not only does ""Hamilton"" avoid these traps, it manages to tell a beautiful and moving story that audiences from all backgrounds can connect to while remaining true to the essential history.And - most importantly - it's entertaining!History is Cool.Alohaüòéü§ôüèº",False

11,7,Quite the crecendo,Garcwrites,n/a,15/08/2025,"@garcwrites: Going in I knew Hamilton: The Musical was two hours and forty minutes long. What I didn't know, well most likely forgot, is that it's in two acts, and that's important. Not being a Musical Theatre aficionado the run time was daunting, but once I started I was kind of feeling it.I was totally engaged - I had to be - because this is a little dense. They sing the whole time, I mean the whole time. It feels like one long as song, with tons of information in lyrics that you don't always understand. So I had to be ""on"" if I didn't want to miss something. At some points of the first act it felt like they were lip-syncing, or as if they put the audio of one performance on the images of another, the sound mixing looked off.By the time the intermission came, it was like a slapped to my face, because like I mentioned I forgot about it so I thought that it was the end of the musical. I was mildly entertain by what I saw and was ready to move on. It legit made me sweat when I realize I had over an hour to go.The second act was truly a breath of fresh air. I felt like I learned more in that part then the first. There was a lot of variety in the songs, which were amazing, but I was captivated by what was going on, not because I could miss something important, I was just entertained.I also appreciated that they didn't sanitize the more questionable aspects of the story. It got me to like the cast even more. I was looking at the performances and soaking in the history.Hamilton is worth the watch it's crescendo with the first act feels like a intro that's running a little long but once you're in the thick of it, it's fun, and clever.",False
12,10,Musical history,TheLittleSongbird,n/a,15/08/2025,"'Hamilton' was a major surprise for me when seeing and hearing it. Music is such a big part of my life, being now a semi-professional singer and raised into a musical family, and am a fan of musicals, especially the golden age ones. History was also one of my favourite and best subjects in most of my up and down school life, until it didn't work out in sixth form when my confidence went and my comprehension and drive worsened. So having a musical to combine the two immediately intrigued me, despite not being the biggest fan of the dominant styles here (was raised on classical music and opera personally).That is what was meant when saying that 'Hamilton' was a major surprise. Hearing that a filmed version of a production was coming to Disney+, which has been a much needed distraction, there was no doubt in my mind about seeing it. So that the mix of history and music, the meaningful and relevant lyrics, the brilliant performances and the energy and heart it has can be revisited again. It does play fast and loose with history, blame that on the musical and not the production, sure and the style(s) of music that dominates the score here are not my first choices usually, but actually for its entertainment value, emotional impact and how well crafted it is as an overall whole, 'Hamilton' was a real winner. As was this production. Which was very much needed after suffering through 'Artemis Fowl', a musical surprise adapted masterfully and so accessibly and through a particularly unsettling time in a terrible few years.It, the production that is, looks great. The sumptuous and true to the respective periods costumes especially and the setting is not too elaborate or overblown while still never looking cheap. Personally thought that the production was very well filmed, certainly compared to other filmed productions of musical theatre, opera and ballet seen and have seen many of each (being a major fan of all three). It made me feel like a member of an audience seeing it live, expect seeing it far more accessibly in terms of money and locations. Which is what is so great about these live/streamed performances and they have proven to be invaluable. Of which 'Hamilton' has been a big highlight.Musically, 'Hamilton' is on point. Those that don't like the styles are best staying away unless wanting to see what the hoopla is all about, but as someone that saw it with an open mind and wanting to stretch even more my musical horizons 'Hamilton' made me appreciate hip hop and rap much more because they were so well done in their own way. When they are well done and not too repetitive or preachy, yes it is dependent on how they're executed in my view rather than any bias towards the styles, that is when it is easy to appreciate them and that is what 'Hamilton' excels so well in. Also found it very well accompanied.What also comes over brilliantly is how 'Hamilton' is written. The musical and performance are very song heavy, which some may not like dependent on what your feelings on musicals, hip hop and rap are (some love it, others hate it and it is all down to taste which is fair enough). Found the melodies very clever and easy to remember, amazing considering how many there are and not an easy thing to achieve these days. It was the lyrics though that made a bigger impression on me, these lyrics were vastly entertaining and also at times quite emotional but what is just as admirable are their honesty and how relevant they are. These are lyrics that are likely to connect for many, and from the sounds of it have done. Historically, it is far and loose but that didn't matter for me being somebody that watched not expecting a history lesson. 'Hamilton' does very well at making people more interested in history and the particular time periods depicted, that is from my experience from seeing it with people that felt exactly the same as me. What is great about this production is how it does so well in being true and capturing the spirited energy and heart of the musical itself, which is what filmed adaptations of musicals in my mind should do.Really loved 'Hamilton's' performances. Have seen both love and hate for Lin Manuel Miranda's performance. Personally loved his work here, he was very heavily involved in making 'Hamilton' work, his dilligent efforts very much obvious here, and he gives the equivalent of the performance of his life here. He is charming and has great authority and comic timing and really do disagree that he doesn't have singing ability, he proved in 'Mary Poppins Returns' in my view that he could and he does great in this regard too. Dramatically he is the stuff of legends as is the joy that was Leslie Odom Jr. Daveed Diggs brings tremendous energy in Act 2 especially and Jonathan Groff is absolutely hilarious here. Phillipa Soo and Renee Elise Goldsberry shouldn't be overlooked either, Soo is especially good. Okieriete Onaodowan has great chemistry with Diggs and holds his own against him when they're together, especially as Madison.Concluding, truly brilliant in my view. It won't be for all tastes but even if one is put off by the first twenty minutes if not knowing what to expect my advice really is to stick with it. It is not worth certainly not bragging about turning it off about 15 minutes or something, that is the equivalent of barely seeing it. One of the easiest 10/10's given recently.",False
13,7,"Conceptually impressive, but while I liked it, I didn't love it",cherold,n/a,15/08/2025,"I never had much interest in seeing a hip-hop Alexander Hamilton. I'm not big on rap (I'm old, after all). But since it came to TV I figured I'd take a look.It's a bold, brave, revolutionary work that I really admire, but it's also a bunch of people rapping, which meant I found it musically less engaging than something like Cabaret and also that I often had difficulty following the story, since it's actually a rap *opera* in which all the dialogue is rapped (or sung).The cast is very good, particularly Ren√©e Elise Goldsberry and Leslie Odom Jr., who are electric. The weakest cast member, unfortunately, is the star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, who I don't believe could have landed the part of Hamilton if he wasn't the playwright. He's not awful, but he never catches fire the way others do.It's a very smart musical. It's beautifully staged (love that eye-of-the-tornado scene). If you like rap it's probably the best musical ever made. I probably would have liked it better with subtitles.",False
14,5,Dare I say... overrated?,coolkev99,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hard to say how I feel about this one, but overall, it's a bit disappointing. Lin Manuel Miranda's (author and lead in Hamilton) vocals sound like a garbage truck driving through an ally. It wouldn't have been so bad if not for the exceptional talent that makes up the rest of this Broadway production.I would have preferred some periods of normal speaking, rather than a literal nonstop rap battle, I think it would have been easier to understand and improve the pacing.Almost all the songs were forgettable, and I couldn't help but feel this was another pandering attempt to ""diversify"" material simply for the sake of diversity. I feel like this production would have been insta-panned by the critics but was praised instead simply because of said diversity.Sadly, I don't know enough about Hamiltons life to know how accurate the story was, I assume it was vaguely accurate.If you like hip-hop you will probably like this despite other shortfalls.",False

16,9,I can't believe it's this good,DGMcCready,n/a,15/08/2025,Never believe the hype. I didn't believe it. For years I had heard so much about a play about of all people Alexander Hamilton-but done to rap or something similar? Can't be good and maybe offensive. But then the noise of its greatness never quieted. So when it finally came to my town I had to see it. But first I listened to the soundtrack. I was hooked. Despite mezzanine seating I was floored how good the play was. I repeated the soundtrack. Day after day and the message became clearer. News of a movie but then a live taping with the original cast. I couldn't wait. Up close made all the lyrics more amazing. The story was better than I recalled. Outstanding performances. I truly loved it.,False

19,n/a,Wonderful,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very intense! I knew the cast album, but it still was amazing. The performances were better than the album, more emotional. Eliza's sceenes were believable, King George was funny.
Jefferson and Hamilton go against each other, and the audience loved it. Even though I knew it was coming, Hamilton's final scene was horrible.
The audio describer was good, sometimes describing the action during the applause, before the singers started singing, or describing during a song. For example, before the Skuylar Sisters song starts he says, ""Burr."" Then, he said ""The Skuylar sisters hold up their silk gowns, dancing in the center of the rotating stage."" After that song, he describes the next one before they start singing.

I am so grateful this made it to the small screen for those of us who weren't able to catch the live show. Not only is just about every word sung, and beautifully at that, but the songs are done in styles to have you hanging on every word. It's the perfect amount of heavy and emotional with comedic lines and acts (thank you King George III).

24,6,"""Forever... and ever... and ever and ever and ever....""",The_Movie_Cat,n/a,15/08/2025,"That is how long Hamilton can seem at points... there's a theory that Jean-Paul Sartre said that ""Hell is other people"" only because he'd never seen musical theatre. But any take on the material is, by definition, subjective - the performers are all strong and professional, even if giving one with a prominent lisp lines like ""I came to say congratulations"" borders on cruelty.Personal choices don't come into this, though a lot of the material does sound quite ""samey"". It's notable that the bits that really break away from the somewhat repetitive songs are with Thomas Jefferson and, particularly, King George. King George's songs are a welcome break from the same general rhythms, and the crowd respond very well to his campy character, though others may find it all a bit too twee and prefer the regular songs.Very much a film for 2020, the interesting thing about Hamilton is what it says for the IMDb Top 250, given that it looks almost certain to remain in the chart by the year's end. The IMDb Top 250 isn't that bad for a mainstream site with a disproportionate male/US/youthful membership. A place where Citizen Kane isn't as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and Rashomon has yet to reach the artistic heights of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, sure, but there's some decent stuff in there. There's also a lot worse films in the chart than Hamilton, with efforts like American History X, Klaus, Rang De Basanti, and, yes, Avengers: Endgame that are throwaway mediocrities at best, risible junk at worst.But as a work of CINEMA, then this is the filming of a stage show. A very well shot and choreographed stage show, for sure, but a stage show nonetheless. Should the filming of stage shows enter the same ""inapplicable"" ruling that now governs shorts and documentaries? As this ruling also extends to TV movies, it means we're living in an age where a stage play can get in the IMDb chart, but efforts like Threads (1984) and Cathy Come Home (1966) aren't allowed.Quite informative, historically, this is a film you'll either like or won't, down to personal taste - are you the sort of person who likes to watch two-and-a-half hours of musical theatre, or not? But whether this musical theatre should be awarded when transferred to a different medium is another matter entirely.",False
25,3,How do I justify a 3 Star Rating?,ejoshcoronado,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI feel these criticisms are not trivial, they are musical/storytelling/songwriting fundamentals1. With very few exceptions, the songs that aren't just rapping have very little melody. It's almost like if you gave someone a page of dialogue and said ""instead of saying this, make it into a song on the spot"". It really often feels like there's that little planning put into the melody structure. Contrast that with the music in The Book of Mormon, where nearly every song is an earworm, and incredibly well written.2. Add to that the lyrics themselves, same thing. If you told me the show was improvised on the spot (Which is exactly what Lin did with his group Freestyle Love Supreme) then I could be impressed. But it's not. Lin had time to pre-write this. They're so basic, and repeat SO much. I can't believe the quality of writing choruses like ""I want to be in the room where it happened, the room where it happened, the room where it happened"". Look at the lyrics to The Story of Tonight:
I may not live to see our glory
I may not live to see our glory
But I will gladly join the fight
But I will gladly join the fight
And when our children tell our story
And when our children tell our story
They'll tell the story of tonight
Let's have another round tonight
Let's have another round tonight
Let's have another round tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away
No matter what they tell you
Raise a glass to the four of us
Tomorrow there'll be more of us
Telling the story of tonight
They'll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom

They'll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
They'll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
They'll tell the story of tonight
They'll tell the story of tonightThey just repeat themselves so much, it's so hard to stay engaged with lyrics like this. You find this throughout the show.3. In Lin you have a man you cannot sing surrounded by phenomenal Broadway singers and it is jarring. If he wanted to put the quality of his play first he wouldn't have taken the lead role.4. This is a story that is complex, covering numerous historical figures, events, policies, court cases, places and dates. And you choose to rap it? It makes it incredibly difficult to catch all of the information they're firing off. I didn't want to but I ended up having to keep the subtitles on.5. Finally, in my opinion, even if this wasn't rap or even a musical, just scenes, I don't feel like it was a cohesive, well paced or structured story/choice of scenes to represent Hamilton's story. It jumps around so much, to different time periods and events. Now suddenly a whole song about some other character who just got introduced halfway through the show. it just felt scattered. Telling the story a man's whole life that was surrounded by so many consequential historical events is a titanic undertaking. It takes an incredible amount dedication and thought and talent. Knowing what it essential to keep in the story, and what should be shed. Where the focus should lie. I like Lin, been a fan since his early appearances in Collegehumor videos, I just feel unequivocally that he did not succeed in pulling this off.To me kind of an exception and the highlight of the show is like 15min in: The Schuyler Sisters and their song. Those three were great together. Special shoutout to Peggy, who kind of stole the show with like 4 lines.",True

1,9,Nostalgic and Inspirational,johnjbudion-89927,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cleverly edited clips from Michael J. Fox's career, juxtaposed against new interviews and insights create a feeling of nostalgia and inspiration. The editing, the pace, and the revelations from Michael brought the crowd to laughter and tears.MJFox the man is greater than MJFox the amazing and talented actor I grew up with, as a kid watching Back to the Future and Teen Wolf. The most inspirational human and a phenomenal film. That's what I felt watching Davis Guggenheim's gem at Sundance. Major congratulations to Mr. Guggenheim, his editor, the entire team, and especially Michael J. Fox.I can't wait to watch it again.",False
2,9,Very moving doc about the ravages of Parkinsons Disease on a Stoic Michael J Fox.,markgorman,n/a,16/08/2025,"You probably know Michael J Fox is Canadian, made Back to the Future and has Parkinson's disease.What you might not know is how resilient, brave, funny and charming he is.What you probably don't know is he falls over a lot and walks like Billy Connolly doing the Glaswegian drunk man impersonation.In this documentary that is brilliantly directed by Davis Guggenheim there are two stars.Michael J Fox who narrates the movie, to camera, with his mangled voice often quite difficult to comprehend and Michael Harte, the editor.It's a piece of magical illusion because somehow the directing/editing team have managed to piece together snippets of Fox's work to sit alongside Fox himself in 'telling the story'. It has echoes of my all time favourite documentary, 102 minutes that Changed America, in that it's essentially 'found footage that's used to tell the story. It's remarkable.But at its core is the sad (not sad) sight of Michael J Fox, that lovable little scamp, at 61 looking like a wreck, but still, somehow defying the hideous encroachment of Parkinsons with dignity and humour.It's very moving and it's very great.",False
3,9,"Humor, warmth and pain",jlager,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not a velvety self celebratory biography, but an honest insight in to the actual man, pain bruises and all, behind the face we thought we knew so well. Giving the sense that life happens to everyone, also celebrities, you understand how absolutely critical family, especially his wife has been in reflecting back on him, so that he could make the choices to become the man he is today. Parkinson's is a brutal disease, as I've also experienced first hand with an acquaintance, but Michael J Fox story, well told through clips from throughout his career, gives hope that you can break through living in accordance with your own perceived expectations of how the world needs to see you, and actually just be your true self, no matter what life brings, and no matter how differently you may be perceived compared to your old ideals. The less polished, authentic Michael J Fox, is an inspiration, and this documentary lets you meet him closer than ever.",False
4,10,Inspirational Biography of Michael J. Fox's Remarkable Journey,JustCuriosity,n/a,16/08/2025,"Still was warmly and enthusiastically received at the SXSW Film Festival. An overflow crowd gave the film and its subject a standing ovation. Unlike your usual Hollywood Biopic, Still is an inspiring story of young, and perhaps somewhat superficial, movie star journey from celebrity to hero.The creative presentation shows the present-day disabled Fox struggling with the consequences of Parkinson's Disease and uses that as a jumping off point for his telling the story of how we went from struggling actor to mega Hollywood star. Then it journeys through his diagnosis with Parkinson's which he initially hid from the public as well as his struggle with alcoholism. Eventually, it shows the evolution of his role as he emerges as inspiration to millions who struggle with Parkinson's and many other disorders. His extraordinary fundraising efforts are a celebration of the human spirit. His dignity and decency in the face of an incurable disease are truly inspiring.The creative format of Guggenheim's film is fascinating, because he uses a mix of clips from Fox's TV and movies along with a series of recreations framed by modern day interviews to tell Fox's story. It is told with great humor and grace.For anyone of a certain age, Michael J. Fox was a cultural icon. Back to the Future is one of the iconic cultural markers of the 1980s. And Still really is in and of itself, appropriately enough, a journey back in time. In a time where we seem to lack heroes, Michael J. Fox is one and this film provides a great tribute to him.",False
5,10,And I'm crying with Cancer! Huge RESPECT!,rjccmb,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've Always loved Michael J Fox for a few reasons... First he's a Fighter, always has been, He's also the guy who against All Odds believed enough to keep going...THIS this documentary Proves that and more. Recalling Family Ties and him meeting his future wife Tracey, she is the equivalent of a perfect match...this man brings joy no matter what he does no matter how he feels that is the constant from before Parkinson's and with Parkinson's. His ability to speak the raw truth and Embrace all sides of his life as the Eye opening example of the conflict of an individual who at a Very young age and on top of his game, Michael J Fox Faced Parkinson's starring it head on, not missing a beat! This young man is a true testament to love, gratitude, appreciation, family, hope, faith, resilience, and Truth! I myself have Cancer, unlike Michael I'm all alone, yet doing all I can within my circumstances... truth is, he will outlive me, and Good for him he deserves that and more! With a beautiful family this life has blessed him with, and the Integrity that he exhibits in speaking for many who have this obstacle in their life that can be debilitating - Yet Michael continues to Shine Throughout the Darkness, Embracing it and being that beacon of hope, faith, light, that we All should honor and I'm grateful to him and thankful not only for his talent and perseverance, but the Character that he is kind enough to continue to offer this world! I must say his wife is nothing but pure love and this family is blessed, blessed to uphold and embrace gracefully e the challenges that life brings... Thank you Michael, you are a Hero to Many!",True
6,n/a,Heartfelt and Very Worthwhile,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Highly recommended. Michael J Fox is authentic and vulnerable in reflecting upon his successes as an actor, as well as his challenges with Parkinson's. He is fortunate to be surrounded by a loving, buoyant family who does not feel sorry for him. Like him, they retain their playful sense of humor, and it's clear that the Fox family has a good time being together. This film is edited effectively, and the director wisely made a choice in how the younger Michael would be portrayed in a handful of scenes. The stand-in they have for him is filmed from the back, which lends credibility. Luckily, for all involved, there is so much actual footage of Michael, mostly from his TV roles, that the editor had a lot of material to work from. The Director is the off-camera interviewer, who asks pertinent questions, while wisely avoiding the trap of sentimentality. It's curious that the film does not spend too much time addressing Fox's outstanding foundation for Parkinson's, but perhaps that will be revealed in a future film. If you're like me, and have known people who have Parkinson's, there are moments of this film which will touch you, while offering new insights.",False
7,9,Another brilliant documentary from Davis Guggenheim,dfloro,n/a,16/08/2025,"Michael J. Fox agreed to make a documentary about his life, career and of course, his battle with Parkinson Disease. As the physician who diagnoses him says, ""it's a battle that you won't win."" But I get the feeling he insisted this would and should be as unsentimental as possible; none of that ""oh woe is me"" crap that drives people to resent rich, successful celebrities struggling with that same real-life crap that we all have to. Michael's angelic wife, Tracy Pollan (who upon learning of his diagnosis, whispers ""in sickness and in health"" ... {sniffles} God Bless Her!) and equally devoted children are clearly his primary reasons for living. But after 10 years of (mostly) silent suffering, he discovered another reason: going public with his incurable condition has increased awareness of it greatly and been a literal, welcome and much-needed $2 billion boon to the funding of research into the disease. I'll admit I was surprised that the punk kid on Family Ties (older than he looked, it turned out) also turned out to be a genuinely good actor. But I was even more surprised and delighted to see him ultimately turn out to be an even better human being. I feel lucky to have lived during the extremely noteworthy life and times of the Canadian actor, wellness activist/philanthropist and man truly with a mission, Michael J. Fox. He is ""da man""!!! I rate this a strong 9 of 10 stars.",False
8,10,Wonderfully put together,burntoutboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a wonderfully creative way to document and show your life so far.I enjoyed every minute of this. The use of old clips and new interviews clips to tell Michaels story was absolutely perfect. How he started his career to where he found out he had parkinson's to then revealing it to the world years later. It worked so well. Pacing was on point so you don't get bored watching it (even if you aren't a Michael J Fox fan). It was funny and moving (no pun intended) and really showed Michael as a person as well as getting a strong message across. No matter whats put in front of you or what issues you have, don't let it consume you and stop you from enjoying life.A must watch documentary film!!",False
9,7,Still,henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Michael J Fox talks about his life, from boyhood, his fondness for his father, becoming a huge film star, falling in love, marrying and having children. The whole documentary though is seen in the context of his discovery that he had, hid from and eventually came to accept that he was suffering from Parkinson's Desease.Fascinating and ever so cleverly put together documentary which uses clips from his films and shows to almost make a film of his life and the struggle to accept and then address the illness he has. He comes across as pleasant, still funny and self deprecating, tough and clearly adoring his wife and kids, who seem very loving and balanced. He is also very honest about drug addiction, alcoholism and once being a pompous ass, but ultimately comes across as likeable and the whole documentary is so interesting and a pleasure to watch if just a little tinged with sadness.",False
10,9,Genuine & Inspirational Look at Michael J. Fox's Career And Parkinson's Battle,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's easy to look at Michael J. Fox's career through the prism of pity: once on top of Tinseltown during his Family Ties-Back to the Future-Teen Wolf run, a young diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease curtailed his acting career and made each day now an uphill battle. But of course, MJF has to live that existence--and to him it is simply an everyday occurrence to keep surviving for and with his family. Others may feel sorry for him--but he certainly does not take that attitude for himself and it shows in ""Still"".For a very basic overview, ""Still"" director Davis Guggenheim does two things simultaneously:First, he looks back on the incredible shooting star ascent that was Fox's career--from a no-name kid in Canada to an absolute takeover of the both the big and small screens in the 1980s. It wouldn't be unreasonable to call him the actor most synonymous with 80s pop culture.Interspersed with the bio material is how Fox currently battles his Parkinson's symptoms, such as the tremors that make walking difficult and cause him extreme pain without carefully mediated medication. Whether working with a speech therapist or a physical therapist, Fox must constantly learn and re-learn the bodily skills he once took for granted.Ironically, speaking to this doc's title, a man who was once a blur of perpetual motion would now do anything to gain some physical calm. Yet, he projects a remarkably positive, upbeat attitude about his current condition. In fact, one of his biggest obstacles is trying to walk too quickly and falling over! In other words, he still retains the youthful spirit that catapulted him to film/TV stardom.I think the hallmark of ""Still"", however, are the clips of MJF interacting with his family. Most who will be interested in ""Still"" already know the backstory, but seeing him laugh and joke with wife Tracy Pollan and their children is a window into his life that will make you smile and bring a tear to your eye.Overall, I really enjoyed ""Still"" and my only slight critique is that the ending was a bit abrupt--I actually wanted more modern-day MJF material! But as it stands, this is a really inspirational doc that shows the courageous, optimistic spirit of Michael J. Fox in the face of seemingly overwhelming adversity.",False
11,7,half his life,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. With his Oscar winning AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH (2006), and follow-ups including WAITING FOR SUPERMAN (2010) and HE NAMED ME MALALA (2015), Davis Guggenheim has proven to be one of the most important and effective documentarians working today. With his latest, he adds a creative touch that blends well with the emotional and personal aspects of this Michael J Fox biography.Most everyone recognizes Michael J Fox as the popular actor from the BACK TO THE FUTURE franchise and/or his enormously successful TV series, ""Family Ties"" and ""Spin City"". Along the way, there were numerous other films and appearances, and at one point in the 1980's, he was likely the most recognized actor on the planet thanks to his box office winning movies, highly-rated TV series, countless magazine covers, and regular Talk Show appearances. On top of all that, in 1988, he married the love of his life, actress Tracy Pollan. He truly had it all.A trembling pinkie signaled a life-changing event for Fox. At age 29, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease ... a disease that typically strikes elderly folks, not otherwise healthy young adults in their physical prime years. For years, he was able to hide his symptoms by timing his medication and disguising his left-hand trembles - either by holding an item or keeping the hand stuffed in his pocket.The creative parts of Guggenheim's film are that he eschews traditional talking heads - and rest assured, there would be a stream of celebrities willing to talk about Fox - and the use of cool editing by cutting in clips of Fox's acting roles into the stories as Fox tells them. That's right ... as Michael J Fox tells his own story. He is his own talking head in this film, and it works brilliantly to allow him to show us his sense of humor remains intact, and that he has learned to deal with the obstacles this disease throws at him. We even see his struggle to get toothpaste on his toothbrush. Yet none of this is designed to elicit sympathy for Fox. Oh no, he will have none of that.We learn his patented perpetual movement dates back to childhood, and are reminded that he was often seen sprinting or moving quickly in his roles ... movements he can no longer execute. In fact, his falls are often brutal, sometimes resulting in broken bones and a broken face (pins in his hand and eye socket). Michael J Fox is a 5-time Emmy winner who has been married to Tracy for 35 years. They share four kids and the obstacles created by Parkinson's. Guggenheim includes a wonderful story regarding a lunch box and Brandon Tartikoff, the wunderkind President of NBC who initially was opposed to Fox being cast in ""Family Ties"". The presentation of Fox's workaholic nature is on full display during the sequence on his simultaneously filming ""Family Ties"" and BACK TO THE FUTURE.Michael J Fox telling us his own story makes this so personal. He admits to ""waiting for the bus"" ... a phrase he copped to describe waiting for the dopamine meds to kick in. He is one of the very few to live more than half their life with Parkinson's Disease, and his sharing the obstacles for all to see is commendable, even if he forbids us from pity.Opens May 12, 2023.",False
12,8,Heartfelt and original,fallyhag,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am of an age where this actor was huge in my time. One of the very big stars. So to learn a little more about him was always a welcome thought.Very soon into this documentary you get the idea that it is different. A new approach to story telling. A lovely format using old clips, drama and humour. It is gentle but so very effective in communicating the heart of the story.I enjoyed this because I learnt from it. It filled those gaps in my memory where he went off my radar. I can now understand why. Whilst it did make me feel sad, it also filled my heart with hope. Knowing that humans have the ability to overcome most things thrown at them. The human spirit is strong, and this documentary proved it.I most definitely recommend watching this. A well made, well balanced and thought provoking documentary. Job well done 👍",False
13,7,Michael J Fox is a fighter for life,kvronti,n/a,16/08/2025,"Michael J Fox is a fighter for life. This shows from a young age how he never let go to, kept at it to show how he loved his work and despite the obstacles always found ways to overcome them. I only remember him vividly from the the blockbuster hit Back to the Future, and now through this documentary I've understood more about his career. Though, being diagnosed with Parkinson's, at a very early age, he never gave up and the most bravest thing he did was reveal it publicly and fight for support in research and funding. He reminds me so much of my mother who had been diagnosed with the same disease, the same symptoms and who suffered a lot. Seeing this film, brought back memories of picturing her again in her world of struggling through Parkinson's, a difficult world, where for us witnessing these difficulties could just barely touch the surface of their suffer and everyday pain.",False
14,5,"No doubt Michael is a beast, but the documentary is not.",imitch-19016,n/a,16/08/2025,"This review is not about Michael. There is no disputing he was a mega-star. There is no disputing that he is an OG BEAST coping and not giving in to his disease. There is no disputing his struggle, his gratitude, his love of his family. But the movie spent a lot of time building up his Hollywood timeline and not focusing more on how he and his family have made this decades journey together. I get they were setting up the juxtaposition of this superstar, hiding his disease out of all kinds of fears, and bringing us to the present. I only wish the story spent more time on the personal side of this. Don't get me wrong...it DOES spend time there, and I know they're telling a story in 90 minutes. I think his Hollywood story could have been told in a 10 minute montage since we all know the story (except for maybe his pre-Family Ties struggle). I want to know more about what scared him (or didn't). DId it ever have a negative impact on his family or was it always ""in sickness and health""? Aside from drinking, did he battle with other demons. That all sounds dark, I realize, and the movie was intended to be an inspiring story about a man who had it all, and had it taken away by something he learned he could not control. That dark and light could have made for a deeper, more touching and maybe more inspiring film. What do I know?",False
15,n/a,Informative and entertaining bio of a superstar's charm and strength.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"From his hit series ""Family Ties"" through the iconic Back to the Future and beyond, the 80's diminutive Michael J. Fox has been an impish cultural giant. With the onset of Parkinson's disease, diagnosed in 1991 and revealed in 1998, he has been known as a fearless fighter, along with other famous sufferers such as Mohammed Ali and Kathryn Hepburn.An informative new documentary Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie, streaming on Apple TV+, is a blend of original footage showing his meteoric rise to fame and subtle re-enactment. In all, it shows his charm and his determination to expose the disease to needed research by campaigning for funding.Director David Guggenheim and editor Michael Harte have seamlessly spliced publicity B-roll, videos, stock footage and a few narrators to create a convincing bio about Michael's rise and fall and permanent rise again to national recognition. This doc is as much a powerful testimony to the threat of Parkinson's as it is a testament to the will power of a former super star to fight it.Because Fox is eminently watchable even under the sway of the disease, this doc is entertaining and informative. He asks for no pity but gains enormous respect for facing reality and fighting for happiness.",False
16,8,Heartwarming.,kenbo-87360,n/a,16/08/2025,"Heartwarming and heartbreaking in equal measures. It's so sad to see the actor of my all time favourite film Back to The Future battling Parkinson's.It is so good to see him fight it head on though. There's no outward pity from him. He must have had plenty of 'why me?' moments, it's impossible not to, but he's fighting this with dignity and a big dose of humour.This film/documentary was brilliantly put together. There's clips from film and television roles that Michael has played over the years that are put together to narrate the story. It is very cleverly done. Other parts of the story are acted out by actors but it's very realistic. You feel like you are watching a young Michael go on his journey through life and grow up in front of us.To steal a pun from the film. It's all very moving!!",False
17,9,still so charismatic,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary biography of Michael J. Fox. Director Davis Guggenheim has done plenty of directing and producing. His most noted work is probably 'An Inconvenient Truth'. For this one, he seems to be channeling Errol Morris.This movie can be divided into three aspects. There is the standard childhood and starving actor stage of his life. It's interesting to see his short stature since his early years and struggling to live on his last dime. Then there is his TV and movie footage pulled together to tell his story. It's great nostalgia for me. It also works really well to show the progression of his career and the disease. The footage makes it seem like a movie we're familiar with, but the story is somehow new.Finally, there is his present day interviews. He is still so charismatic although the disease has taken its toll. He shows his everyday struggles. Quite frankly, his is the same struggle that my elderly mother went through a few years earlier. I think a lot of the audience can see their family in his situation. It fills out my understanding of his disease and makes something human instead of simply academics. I grew up watching this guy. His humor is still here. More than ever, his dignity and humanity is on display.",False
18,10,a super performance...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"By the parkinsonistic michael j fox, a super duper production and especially the editing directors work makes me debaffeled and drawn to tears in the end...im just amazed how extremely well they have composed this biographical ''this is my life''(once sung by danish group ''gasoline''), a life seemingly going from adhd to ptsd to p.d. With a little bit of huntington in there...i just cant see why mr fox hasnt been able to get the infamous electronic implant that so many norwegian p.d. Patients have had such great success with. I have worked a lot with p.d patients in my profession as a nurse and i must say that mr fox is a very atypical one, he is small, but ive never had any patients that has been smaller than miself at 1,72mtr, and he has a sense of humour that aint typical for the p.d patient, it may be the effect of dopamin that drives them nuts, search me...but its a nasty disease, and it may hit you too, so beware, be as drugfree as you can, cause the synthesized ones may hit you like a hammer and present you to a life with parkinson, no pun intended, remember your brain is like a nut, and if that goes rotten your going nuts too.Well if there is one bio film over a still alive and kicking actor, this should be the one, itll touch you anyhow.i had a heartaching moment watching Val Kilmers ''val'' a few years ago, this is the same shoesize of documentarymaking. Stay well mr fox, chronic pain aint fun, i can agree to that. A big recommend from the grumpy old man.",False
19,8,"Moving, intelligent portrayal of the indomitable Fox...but incomplete",arete_1,n/a,16/08/2025,"In short, my only major criticism is that I think this should have been about half an hour longer. Maybe there will be an uncut version?Longer version:I grew up in the 80's/90's and well remember the Michael J. Fox craze. Though I was never (and still am not) someone who is very interested in celebrity culture/keeps up on what famous people are doing in their personal lives, I always felt some special affinity/affection towards Fox. Maybe because I'm also a shorter guy (5' 7"") and was a shorter kid (5' 1"" to 5' 5"" throughout much of high school).But this was probably mainly due to watching Family Ties as a kid and, especially, my love for BTTF which is twofold: it's a great movie for everyone, but it was huge among my pre-teen crowd (kids even trying to hitch onto cars with skateboards, and, more constructively, standing up to their ""Biffs"") and I vividly remember my mother going out to watch it (alone or with a friend I don't remember), coming home excited, telling me I had to come see this movie, and then we went to see it within an hour. (I never saw her so excited about a movie!).From the first scene I loved it, and seeing it in the theater for the first time with my mom when I was 8 is one of the special memories I have of my mother who died young 12 years later of ovarian cancer. She actually died during Spin City's run and I remember she liked that show too and I sometimes watched it with her, but by that time I was more in my teen ""reject grown up stuff and keep to myself"" snotty phase and didn't like the show much (I've recently decided I'm going to stream it, partly to rekindle some memories of my mom and I watching it; scenes or episodes I remember).***************Anyway, I remember all the Michael J. Fox Parkinson's news when he made it public, and it disturbed me, but I had other things going on at the time (young adult life, mother's death still recent, etc).Since then, I've just seen Fox pop up here and there on late night shows, some movies/tv roles (the Curb appearance was hilarious and great writing!), and etc, but I never read any of his books or anything.So I went into this being a fairly causal fan, but still one curious about his story more than most famous people (besides philosophers and scientists of whom I've read biographies/autobiographies of). IOW I rarely watch documentaries on celebs. But my feeling of connection to Fox was strong enough to make me interested in this.***************Michael seems to me, as much as one can ascertain from these snipets into someone's life, a deeply decent, humane person who has many positive attributes (perhaps most striking being the buoyancy of his humor, his love of/warmth for his family, his empathy, his groundedness, his friendliness, his work ethic, his honesty, and of course his inner strength and overall unyielding determination).And being a causal fan I of course learned a lot of new/interesting things, especially about his early life. And yes this was moving, inspiring, disturbing, often brutally honest (which I really appreciated; especially about the alcohol abuse as I went through some years of that myself)...an overall vivid view of the human condition as it manifests in both good and bad periods and events throughout a person's life.***************However, and this is not a complete list, I felt several things were missing or not quite fully worked out:After 2000 there isn't much coverage of Fox's life either professionally or personally. His story hardly ended around then, and is far from over now. How, in particular, has the disease progressed and how has he struggled with it over the decades? I did seem Fox recently say in an interview(s) that he's had periods of little hope recently, that his struggle has gotten harder as he's gotten older, and that he doesn't think he'll see 80...these dark aspects weren't really even mentioned in Still.Also, brief interviews with Fox's wife and family, and even a few good friends, how all this has affected them, what they think of his struggle/him as a person, would have been very illuminating.Related to the ""paucity of post 2000 coverage"" above, I especially wanted to know what the impetus was to set up the Fox Foundation (at least beyond the broad strokes), how hard that was to do, how rewarding and helpful it's been to him and others suffering from Parkinson's (does it give him meaning and purpose to his life in addition to his acting and family?), what research its done, etc. Interviews with medical experts, ""foundation builders"" (the types who set up and run these things) and regular workers there would have been interesting to me.There was some problems with continuity or linear progression: for instance, there was no mention of the end of Family Ties or why it was cancelled (I still don't know why because I never looked it up), just a kind of ""ok, now Fox is doing other things like these 90's movies, of which several weren't well received"", and overall the sequence of events in the movie was kind of hazy. Not jumbled together so much as not altogether real clear to those, like me, who don't really know the details of Fox's life course.What are Fox's interests besides those that are publicly known? What does Fox like to do? That is, what does he do on an average day? Does he work at/for his Foundation fairly often or did he ever? Does he reach out to fellow Parkinson sufferers who contact him? What hobbies? Cooking? Reading? Watching TV/Movies? Writing? (at least things not for publishment as we know he writes that material, but for himself? Does he journal?). Exploring and listening to music? Travelling? We know he probably does a lot of physical therapy and that of course everyday tasks are more time consuming for him than others, and that he still does some acting projects, but he has a lot of free time to fill and all has all the resources to discover and explore the various activities/interests in life! Perhaps nothing tells you more about a person than how they spend their time, so I was just curious about this.In any case, though this was in some aspects a personal and revealing look at parts of Fox's life, other areas remain a mystery (which he of course has a right to keep private, but I don't feel that concern is the case here so much as just plain oversight or editing down for time).Anyway, I've gone on quite long enough and probably few have read all this (and I don't blame you!), so in sum I'll just say that the real main flaw I had with this biography was I wanted more of it! That in itself shows how much it interested me (a confessed ""non-celeb culture"" type of guy), and thus how much it accomplished what I feel all good creations should: be interesting. And I think the last thing Micheal wants to be is uninteresting (the ""no, that's boring"" quote in the trailer made that very clear). There is no worry of that!",False
20,7,STILL M.J.F.,Pjtaylor-96-138044,n/a,16/08/2025,"'Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie (2023)' is proof that sometimes all you need to make a good documentary is a likeable subject, and there's nobody quite as likeable as Michael J. Fox. His indomitable spirit shines through in every scene, even those depicting the struggles that come with his illness, and his razor sharp wit cuts to the humorous heart of each situation he describes. It's upsetting to see the effects of Parkinson's on one of cinema's most enduring icons, but the picture's honest representation of the disease is equally as important. It's clear that Fox doesn't want anyone's pity, and the picture itself isn't interested in fostering that feeling in its audience. Instead, it wants you to see that Fox is just as charming, just as entertaining, just as gentle and just as full of life as he always has been. His Parkinson's diagnosis wasn't an ending, it was just another chapter. Essentially a companion piece to Fox's various autobiographies, the film is a fairly basic celebrity documentary at its core, providing us with an overview of its star's career and a look into his current lifestyle. It isn't massively insightful, nor surprising to those who have read the aforementioned books, but it is from Fox's perspective and that's what really matters. Unlike so many others of its kind, it tells its tale from the inside. It isn't interested in what others think of Michael J. Fox's journey, it's only interested in what Michael J. Fox thinks of his journey. Because of this and its subject's absolute integrity, it's a very wholesome and heartfelt affair. Its use of archive footage is notably considered and - alongside a handful of newly shot recreations - it compliments the various to-camera interviews with its star really well. It's worth mentioning, too, that Fox is the only person given the to-camera treatment, which is yet another signifier that the affair is intended as a true (or as close to it as possible) representation of its lead's life that allows him to tell his story his own way. It doesn't want any gossip or contrasting points of view, it doesn't want to eulogise the career of someone who's still alive or have others tell his tale for him, it doesn't need to remain objective because its very being is predicated on it being as subjective as possible. It's a portrait of a person unwilling to let his circumstances stop him from being the best version of himself he can be, a cinematic icon who didn't disappear when life dealt him a bad hand and people began to tell him how the rest of his days would play out. The flick doesn't wash over the dark periods in Fox's life, but it's overwhelmingly positive on the whole. By the time it reaches its uncharacteristically poignant final shot, it may not have conveyed any real theming or challenged your expectations, but it should have left you with a tear in your eye, a smile on your face and an unwavering admiration for the man who went back to the future.",False
21,8,Love Michael J Fox even more. Honest and inspiring.,lbunjevac,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great chronological outline of MJF career starting when he dropped out of HS to become an actor. Documentary styled where MJF tells his own story in present time on camera and actors recreate his past. Michael's honesty and genuine on camera charisma has not changed, even though he struggles tremendously to speak and move.A phenomenal story. To be diagnosed with this 'old person's' disease at the age of 29, had to come as a complete gut punch, especially at the height of his career. Michael J Fox is a champion who has never, and will never be still.An added bonus is the musical soundtrack. It will take you back in time. I only wish it went longer than an hour and thirty seven minutes!",False
22,7,Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Now this is how you do a documentary about illness! Clearly this is a man with considerable skill in front of a camera, but his general demeanour and willingness to reflect on the drawbacks and positives of his Parkinson's Disease is revelatory and engaging. Using his highly successful Hollywood career as a bedrock, he shares the roller-coaster ride that has been his life. From his burger-fuelled bedsit, through ""Family Ties"" then his struggle to get film roles, his astonishing success and then to his discovery and disclosure of his illness. It's all presented candidly, amusingly and by a fellow who has steadfastly refused to be beaten. Frequently looking a bit bruised and battered after a fall, and unafraid to illustrate the effects on his mobility and speech, he uses his celebrity status to fundraise for better research into this debilitating brain disease - but he does it without whining. He appreciates he's had a great life - he's a wealthy man with a wife of 30-odd years and four children whom he clearly adores. So many of the documentaries we see nowadays are presented by people who take a camera phone and just use it as an excuse for an highly personal rant. This man has taken the time to construct - from his own book - a narrative that structures how his own (pretty constant) physiotherapy, his dependence on medication and the love of his family give him continuing strength to combat his own demons, sure, but also to put things into a perspective and that I found sad, but actually quite heart-warming. My one complaint is the interviews he does with director Davis Guggenheim. Couldn't he have given himself a microphone? He does rather mumble. Anyone else think MJF now looks a bit like Mark Hamill?",False
23,10,@sleepyratingscale- wide awake,thebimp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved it!! I forgot how amazingly charming he is. His comedic timing is superb. He makes jokes about himself and his situation, so you can't feel sorry for him. He hasn't let Parkinson's disease stop him. Loved how they piece together aspects of his movies and tv shows to tell his story. Side note- I still think Back to the Future is the best trilogy of all time!! I had the biggest short man crush on him. It's so crazy that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in his 20s and for so many years was hiding it from the general public as he continued to act. I wanted to cry as I watched but I had the feeling he doesn't want me to cry about his plight but he just seems and looks like he is trapped. Though he has to fight hard to be still now or take medications to be in that state, he has not remained still and continues to advocate for more research and being unapologetically himself.",False
24,7,A quintessential piece of the Fox puzzle,eddie_baggins,n/a,16/08/2025,"A presence that loomed large over the pop culture landscape in the 1980's and well into the 90's, it's hard not to have some type of affiliation for beloved actor Michael J. Fox, whose diminutive stature never held him back from becoming one of the biggest celebrity icons of all time.For me, my childhood was surrounded by re-runs and re-winds of the Back to the Future series, while I can barely recall a moment browsing the TV that didn't involve a snippet of either Family Ties or Spin City but these key films and shows masked something much deeper for Fox as he hid and battled a debilitating Parkinson's diagnosis that has defined his life as the self professed optimist battles the incurable disease he has now been fighting for the past 30 plus years.Teaming up with Oscar winning documentarian Davis Guggenheim, Still is far from a typical expose of someone's life and career and refuses to dwell on the emotional toll of Fox's battle against such an horrific and all encompassing health battle as we are here gifted the Fox story as told by the man himself, who here gets to dictate how much we get to delve into his various ups and downs, often told with imaginative use of old film/TV footage and also honest and raw voiceovers and conversations with the key subject himself.It's a wild ride journeying back to the late 70's and early 80's where a boyish teenager from Canada moved to Hollywood determined to crack the industry seemingly against the odds, only to find himself the center of both the biggest TV show at the time and a movie franchise that changed the scene forever and throughout our look back at the making of the man the public knows of today, Fox remains an engaging and likeable storyteller who you can't help but root for.Whether it's humour in the face of adversity many would crumble at or his mindset to find an appreciation for what Parkinson's has done for him, not what its taken away from him, Fox uses his chance to gift Still to the world as an opportunity to ensure the narrative around him is clear as he faces the impending prospect of no longer being able to express himself or his tale the way in which he would like and while at times you wish Guggenheim would push harder into certain topics or moments in Fox's career, Still is without doubt a quintessential piece of the Fox puzzle and a must for anyone that has been a part of Fox's rise to fame over the last forty years.Final Say -A unique documentary that explores an equally unique and eminently likeable subject matter, Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie is a documentary about an unforgettable man told by the man in question and should be required viewing for anyone that has enjoyed his work over the past few decades.3 1/2 lunchboxes out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",False
25,5,Missing Something,damianphelps,n/a,16/08/2025,I didn't find what I was looking for in the Michael J Fox documentary Still. Many of the items shared I had been aware of previously. I was looking for another layer of his humanity but the film failed to deliver it for me.The film itself is well constructed using clips of Fox's work to deliver the imagery of events. The running time was perhaps 20 to 30 minutes too short to really go to a more interesting place than we ultimately end up.As a fan of Fox I'm very glad I watched the documentary but I think an opportunity for cinematic greatness has been sadly missed.Give it a look and see for yourself :),False

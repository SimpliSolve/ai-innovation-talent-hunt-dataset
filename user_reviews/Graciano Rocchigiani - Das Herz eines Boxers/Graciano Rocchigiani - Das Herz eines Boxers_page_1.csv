1,10,Recommendable for both box-fans and newbies (like me),filizfeliz,n/a,16/08/2025,"A really impressive movie which made me feel all the emotions, root for the characters and even cry a little.. even though I didn't know anything about boxing or Rocky before! The movie takes you through the various steps of the life of Graciano Rocchigiani, told through authentic and touching statements of friends, family and journalists. I learned that boxing is about more than just hitting each other brutally, how the sport changed through the years from underground to more mass-/higher-class appropriate, and what a major role one special person played in Graciano's life and this men-dominated world... no more details so that there is no spoiler!A great work of the director Christin Freitag, I am really looking forward to her future work.",False
2,10,One of the most moving biopics of modern cinema,konstantinmuenchau,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the most moving biopics of modern cinema.Truly captivating and intimate portrait of one of Germany's most important yet too often overlooked boxing stars. Besides portraying Rocchigiani in all his complexity and ambiguity, the film also makes you reminisce the ""good old days"" of Berlin in the 80-90s where a sense of freedom ruled the streets and backyards. So it's not only something for boxing fans, but basically a fascinating glimpse into one of Germany's (and Europe's) most complex and defining eras of recent decades.The fact that the biopic features many of Rocchigianis long time friends and family makes it even more intimate.",False

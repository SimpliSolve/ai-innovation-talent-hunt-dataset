1,10,Engaging and Full of Pathos,makoishy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Disco's Revenge tells the story of disco as a grand epic. Unlike most other genres, disco music along with its distinctive scene, has a compelling narrative arc. This captivating story is told in full from its humble origins in New York house parties, to its metoeric rise to mainstream popularity, to its precipitous fall from grace at the turn of the 1980s. The film tells this story by expertly interweaving interviews with the people who were largely responsible for creating disco with archival footage from the 1970s. Often the filmmakers will intercut interview with footage of the exact events their subjects are recollecting. The effect on the audience is to make one feel completely immersed in this lost world of the golden age of disco, and want more than anything to be able to travel back in time to experience it first hand. At times funny, at others tragic, and always highly engaging, Disco's Revenge is nothing short of one of the best music documentaries ever made. Plus, as one would expect, it has a killer soundtrack.",False

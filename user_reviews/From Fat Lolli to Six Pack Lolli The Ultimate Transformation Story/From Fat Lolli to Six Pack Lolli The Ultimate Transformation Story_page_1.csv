1,5,It helps to be a millionaire,s-a-apple,n/a,16/08/2025,Dude's a mega millionaire. Of course he can lose 125 pounds in 9 months when he can afford a personal trainer and a dietitian and eat organic everything and work out all day long because he doesn't have a real job since he sold his company for millions.I want to see documentary that profiles a normal person with a 40k/yr and a 9-5 job - THAT is inspirational.,False
2,5,I was enjoying it until...,jljacobi,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's some pretty explicit body and operative stuff in here that had me turn off the movie. Just didn't want to see hanging fat, and... You get the point. It was relatively interesting until then.If the explicit stuff (not sex), doesn't bother you then you might find something of interest here.I do want to take exception with one viewer who had an issue with the guy sneaking to get a burger. No one goes through all that, sees a new person in the mirror and goes back. No one. So get off your high horse. Why you would even assume a single burger spells disaster is beyond me.",False
3,6,Inspiring but......,mitchmenghi,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNo one can deny that Anthony has made a massive transformation that potentially saved his life.Like other reviewers the thing that I found was that having money behind you will help you achieve these goals much easier.At the beginning he boasts about how successful he was in business but that he struggled all his life with his weight. Some reviewers have said this is an ego trip. It is not, you cannot judge someone for telling a story and then saying its an ego trip. If he was lying then I guess that would be a bad thing, but just because he worked hard in business and made money does not make him egotistical. I did not feel at any point he had an ego, there was a lot of warmth and compassion behind everything.What I did have an issue with was the fact that he had a lot of money behind him, to the point that he had dieticians following him around hourly looking after him. He pretty much did not have to go to work anymore, he had time on his hands which a lot of people do not have the luxury of.As some other reviewers said, it would be good to see a real life person, working 40 hours a day, kids, wife, morgage, pressures of life and how they overcame obstacles to achieve goals without millions of dollars behind them.Overall thou, when you take that out of the equation, the documentary is good, and inspirational and had good intentions.",True
4,1,"100% Ego, 0% Inspirational/ Informational/ Interesting",ceonimdb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This guy clearly can't get enough of himself....shot after shot of him working out, posing, talking about how amazing he is at everything. If anyone else speaks, it's usually about how amazing he is. Good for him for having enough money and time to hire a bunch of trainers to help him power through that much weight loss in 9 months. Just don't expect him to impart any meaningful training or dietary info to help you on your own fitness journey. Wife needs help with the kids? Nope, gotta hit the gym and take more video of myself working out. If you're up for watching 90 minutes of self indulgent instagram posts strung together into a ""documentary,"" then this is for you.",False
5,1,A 90 minute vanity exercise,colbyreade,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are so many documentaries that show how ""average"" people change their lives by losing weight. This isn't one of them.Anthony's transformation is incredible and he should be proud of that ... he put in the work and the time ... but this movie is really bad. It's a 90 minute vanity exercise (pardon the pun). It's an attempt to inspire, but it does so based on a premise that is flat out impossible for 99% of the population to access.If you want to see what it takes to transform from fat to fit at any cost, this is a good story. If you want to see tea life inspiration to improve your health, look elsewhere.",True
6,1,Money Grab,haroldglennbuford,n/a,16/08/2025,So let me get this straight. A millionaire hires 3 personal trainers and a nutritionist and thinks you can do the same thing? Suuuuure. This was in no way educational or inspiring. Showboating to the fullest. Just a money grab to pay for all the expensive training and flying a dude from Ireland to cook for him. Don't waste your time watching this.,False
7,2,Lots of gloss/noise/glitz and little else,Polsinga,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a tedious 94 minutes of showboating Mr Lolli's change from a lumpy fat guy, and a self-proclaimed real estate mogul, to being on a stage in a small-time, low level physique show (in which everyone is his category was named ""the winner"").Clearly, this man lost a lot of weight and built his body to something quite different to what it was before. That is all quite fine. But for the viewer, there is very little in the way of details of how he did what he did and what he had to go through, day in, day out, week in week out, month in month out.
And apart from a couple of sad events that occurred during his transformation, there isn't any footage of him struggling, of giving up, of getting despondent/dispirited/demotivated or tired, or of being unable to continue when working out. There is no mention of any issues with giving up the crap food he was eating, or how he felt, day in day out.
Then there are these numerous and pointless few seconds shots of him saying ""Today is (enter date)"" blah blah blah - what exactly is the point of showing the viewer that Mr director? In 9-10 months, we learned very little of what Mr Lolli went through to transform his body, but we saw lots of footage of biceps flexing, irritating stomach showing (by Mr Lolli and from one of his trainers, who is highly irritating and clearly in love with himself), and lots of footage of him doing various exercises, but none of him struggling, or in pain, or also, how much money he had to spend for all that he chose to do and that he lavished on all the people involved with him, which looks like many thousands of dollars, once it is all added up.
And of course, Mr Lolli is not working, so he doesn't have that aspect to deal with, unlike 95% of other people.It seems that Mr Lolli didn't want to show any aspects of his journey that don't make him look good or that he didn't have to fight (win) over. Indeed, this a naked self-promotion for Mr A. Lolli, masquerading as a documentary, and which shows no failures of Mr Lolli, or any issues that face a large percentage of the population who are in similar positions to Mr Lolli, but who are not like him and do not have the resources he does.There is also just too much footage of pointless scenes, of highly obtrusive music, flashy lights, etc., which just adds to the off putting message of this unhelpful and waste of hard disk space.The various glaring omissions are quite significant, because glossing over numerous and complex issues, including the mental/emotional aspects that plague/frequent many of those who seek to lose weight or get fit, are very difficult barriers to overcome and Mr Lolli's 'look at how great I am"" advertorial does zero for such people.This is just an advert for how great Mr Lolli is. But we don't know what he actually went through to get from where he was to where he ended up.",False
8,10,Good Story plus Real Person equals Success.,lawartis-02991,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this documentary and at first glance you will focus on Anthony finances and I think that's an easy thing to do. That's not the story. It was his daughter that inspired him to lose weight. The Bible speaks about out of the mouth of babes. When a child says something true it changes you. Anthony wasn't an athlete as a child. In fact working out was foreign to him. He was determined to see the change in his 40s. That's not an easy thing to do. I was inspired by his tenacity and focus. It inspired me to do everything I can to be a better me. Anthony didn't have to change his appearance or body at all. He felt compelled to do it. He went for it and knocked it out the park. The director, cinematography, and editor should be very proud of this documentary. It was well done and an inspiration to all to make a change within and the outside will follow.",False
9,7,Impressive transformation but documentary is lacking.,cincinnatus513,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe transformation was very impressive and inspiring. While I will agree with other reviews that point out that we didn't get the day to day week by week details. It could have been better produced.
Yes he paid trainers because he has the means but that speaks to his intelligence of knowing what he doesn't know. For the people hating I don't get it. It's sad to see such hate. Someone mentioned that he went to get a cheeseburger after the show. He trained and ate a strict regime for months leading up to the show to get to in the ballpark of 5 to 7% body fat. BTW I think he earned a few cheat meals after the show. Getting your body fat that low is only temporary. For a man with that amount of muscle he would look great at 15%.",True
10,1,Empty Calories Just Don't Satisfy. Vapid Vanity Devoid of Values,jaybreen-58388,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most other reviewers have already noted the shallow nature of this documentary - how Anthony has the privilege of being able to hire expert trainers and nutritionists to come live with him, of buying the most expensive foods, of nearly unlimited time to neglect his loved ones in pursuit of vanity. They've noted how at no point in the movie does the viewer learn anything about the specific variables involved in transforming from obese to ripped in 9 months - probably because any medical, nutrition, or fitness professional knowledgeable about such a transformation would ethically have to speak to how dangerous and unsustainable it is to do this. Anthony doesn't attempt to hide the fact that this is a shameless self-promotion vehicle, or rather he does so under the guise of ""inspiration""; which he may well actually believe this documentary to be. Given that much of the footage was no more than six months old when it aired, it would be far more telling to check in in five years because the science of dramatic weight loss is in, and in nearly all cases people's bodies literally fight to bounce back to their previous state of obesity once it has been established. It seems to be a matter of biological reality. So, the real litmus test is what happens from now on with Anthony.Other notable takeaways include the values on display within the family and marriage. Early, we hear his wife explain how she has a ""list"" of qualifications for prospective boyfriends or husbands, and how Anthony met many of the items on her list in spades - presumably his having money offset the fact that he was obese if we read between the lines here. Take the fact that his inspiration came when his toddler reached for some french fries and this wife said ""don't eat those, you're going to get fat!"" before exposing her to a fear inducing video about how obesity leads to death. I'm sure this kid will have a healthy body image growing up...not. Questionable parenting decisions aside, Anthony clearly lived in a situation where his weight was tolerated but not accepted, further evidenced by her comments about how he neglected her and the kids to follow his insane weight loss schedule and dangerous flouting of doctor's orders to rest while healing from his blubberectomy, saying ""well he was never there, but now I have THIS"" pointing to his now chiseled physique and infinite buttcrack. Alas, people like this deserve one another, but spare the children, please!",False
11,10,Inspiiring,kmask2002,n/a,16/08/2025,"So. I read the first * review list here (thus far); the one which mentions the amount of money Anthony spent on the process. The person labored to discount the humanistic aspect of the documentary....missing the point(s). Deep within the context and content of the show is showcasing the determination he had (has) with regard to reaching these goals.
The elements of what he did can be done with any diet reg that anyone with access to ANY food chooses. The workouts are manageable on any floor or with any set of home weights and or rocks/logs around the house.
Bravo to Anthony for his accomplishments and sharing this....well done.

12,1,This Really Sucked,BTweezy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't believe I wasted time with this narcissistic pile of crap. I mean, I was going to fall asleep on the couch regardless, but this mindless egotistical drivel in the background was such a waste of electricity.I particularly loved the wife's reference to her ""checklist."" It's nothing special, pretty much the same ""checklist ""every other gold digging cooz in the world has, money. That's it. Thanks for sharing what we all already knew. You can be a fat piece of crap but as long as you're rich you can bag a hot gold digging piece of quiff.Shame on Jeff Bezos for letting this steaming pop of crap on his platform.",False
13,2,Money can buy you everything except..,Huggy_Boy,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe ability to inspire.Anthony - good job man!
What you did was insane and awesome.But for the rest of us who cannot afford several trainers, or workout for up to 6 hrs a day, and fly in a nutritionist, your story is not inspirational.You were flaunting your money again in the hopes of making more - yeah, don't think the viewers can't read between the lines.At the end of the documentary, I was just as disappointed as you visibly were when they announced the winner.On a softer note:
I am sorry for the loss of your friend/ trainer.",True
14,3,He seemed to have learned nothing,Sodriso,n/a,16/08/2025,"After all this man went through, after he spent all the money he did, after he surrounded himself DAILY with all those fitness and health people, FOR OVER 1.5 YEARS, the first thing Tony did when the body show was over, was to sneak away and go eat a burger.Really?So Tony seemingly learned nothing about food and how the fake foods he previously ate were a significant factor in him being overweight and obese and doing a lot of damage inside his body which he cannot see.Perhaps the education on food was not enough or clear enough?
I think this guy may well end up back where he was, and if he has a food addiction, which many people have without realizing it (including myself), he will put on the pounds again.Did he keep going to the gym, every day, once the show was over? Or 2-3 times a week? Or at all?There was one telling moment of his mindset, when his wife was explaining that he would deny her attention because he was so committed to his goal. And he explained, I knew I had to sacrifice some things in order to get to my goal in a short time, rather than take longer. Then ""once it was out of the way, I can get back to living normally"".This mindset shows that Anthony doesn't understand that he has to KEEP doing all that he did (but perhaps with less intensity since he doesn't need to lose weight, compete in a show, etc., anymore), FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.
This should not have been a one time thing, which Anthony seems to have treated it as it was.I hope since the show he has kept the weight off and stopped eating garbage, because that undoes all he has achieved.",False
15,1,Horrendous,trevholmz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm very much into fitness & there is zero inspiration from this. Should be called ""the transformation into an even bigger bigot"".",False
16,2,"Good for him, but...",ciaranmarley,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you thought body transformation shows are a bit dull and self indulgent then you ain't seen nothing yet!With massive resources at his disposal our hero decides to finally do something about the weight problem that has beset him most of his life. He sets about hiring a squad of personal trainers and a nutritionist (who came from Ireland but sounds about as Irish as Paddy the Greek) and films the whole thing.To be fair, he actually does the work and gets stunning results but this is hardly an inspirational tale. He and his buddy also decide early on that they are going to 'monetise' the whole endeavour which left me with questions about the true motivation here.
Very dull film which I switched off about half way through as it mostly consisted of him announcing the day and date of his training sessions into his phone camera.Not a character you can root for or particularly like. Also, telling a three year old not to have a french fry because they will get fat, set off alarm bells with me.I would love to see the movie about the person who has not got two cents to rub together, who has to use park benches and milk cartons because he can't afford a gym membership, who does this like his life literally depended on it and who shares a message of 'if I can, you can and no excuses'.
Now THAT would be truly inspirational.",False
17,8,A tale of focus and determination,poppaboyce,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anthony documented his own journey and the film is mainly made of his phone videos and handicam clips edited together.This is done really professionally and the quality is good.The power of self discipline and limitless determination is what this film shows.Also collaborate and take advice.These lessons apply to achieving anything.Sure the guy was a millionaire at the start of the film, but self made. So the attributes he shows he had already applied to getting rich.You don't need to start successful to become successful. You have to be determined to succeed.",False
18,1,Missing the point it was trying to be,ms-58966,n/a,16/08/2025,"Forget the money, forget the comparison to a regular person being able to accomplish what he did etc etc.This was a simple production attempting to be something it could not of been. It focused simply on Anthony and HE achieved and pushed , and therefore anyone can do it.I'm not arguing that he achieved something exceptional. Nor am I arguing that no one else could, because anyone can (maybe not in that timeline without the assistance) but it can be done.Why I am giving it a low star is the execution it self. This could of been a 15 min You tube clip and summed everything up. Very repetitive. He should of shared more details on the work outs themselves, the food intake etc.Good for him that he could afford the trainers and nutritionists. But why not share it journey where people could attempt to copy it at home. That would of been a film of inspiration, not this compilation of truly repetitive clips.He had the chance and blew it.",False
19,10,Don't listen to the haters!,rachelmason-48039,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst of all this IS inspiring, regardless of how much ""help"" Anthony had, he put the work in. Weight doesn't lose itself. Myself and my husband have both been put in the right mindset thanks to a Anthony and we have watched many fitness documentaries and the momentum is lost once the show is over. The fact he carried on despite his close friend passing away (who was one of the people to motivate him in his journey) is inspiring in itself. Yes you have to sacrifice time with family, if you want the results in a short time. That is ok it's his life and I'm sure his wife understood this as the end result benefits all the family which he also stated. If you don't like to see someone work out then don't watch a fitness documentary I'm sorry....that's not reason to leave bad reviews. He used his skills with marketing business etc to help promote something that can benefit your health this is admirable he could have just not shared his journey and still be rich think about it he was winning regardless ... thank you so much again Anthony 👏👌",True
20,1,Garbage,vikpeacock,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not inspirational by any means. If anything, the guy has no will power by hiring so many people to help him. Surely he felt like a cheat standing on that podium and having all those people there for him.All kudos to Mike (coach) as he knows what he's actually doing.",False
21,1,Not inspiring,karleeann-53246,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary was filled with shallow people and dangerous methods. This guy is going to gain everything back in the next five years when he stops training 3 times a day and his paid friends go home.,False
22,3,Some inspiration but too egocentric,dpaunovic25,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI have to say the first third part of this documentary is inspiring however after that it gets into a spiral of self presentation and bragging. As mentioned from other users it would have been great to focus more on the whole process and to choose a more relatable form like not having a trainer and a cook and doing all by yourself. Otherwise it seems like you need money to loose that much weight and get in shape.,True
23,1,"No inspiration, just bragging",sukhgash,n/a,16/08/2025,"No inspiration, nil learning about nutrition or exercise, just a guy who hired multiple trainers and nutritionist to get results like thousand other millionaires and actors.",False
24,10,What an inspiration!,ste-48176,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great documentary. You see how the gentleman, had taken on the challenge to be around for his small kids. It's given me the real kick up the backside to motivate me, as we can all watch films like this and do nothing about it! To all the haters that have left negative reviews, yes he is a self made man, from real estate! It's documented at the start for a few mins. So what ? Do something with your lives! Instead of being jealous. Just saying. I won't spoil it for others , but hope there is a second part, as the virus must of caused issues.",False
25,10,Inspirational!,NikoletaMorales,n/a,16/08/2025,I loved watching this documentary because it inspired and motivated me to change and I could relate to Anthony's story. Having a toxic relationship with food affects your mental and physical well being and I know personally how hard it is to change that. Seeing his full story in the documentary showed me it is possible to make a change if you want it bad enough! Thank you for showing us your journey and for allowing me to be a part of it as an RBT cast member. Watching your transformation live on stage in Atlanta was amazing and inspirational!,False

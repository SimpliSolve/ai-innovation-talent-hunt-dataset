1,3,A feeble and vapid attempt at milking the old formula,fredrikgunerius,n/a,15/08/2025,"Whereas the original Leaving Neverland from 2019 was an important document of two men telling their version of the truth about what happened at Michael Jackson's Neverland ranch in the 1990s, this follow-up documentary is a feeble and vapid attempt at milking the old formula and placing blame where it arguably doesn't belong. Suing a business for what one of their deceased employees did in his own home outside of work seems a particularly dangerous path to tread - and a little too obviously motivated by money. The lack of such motivation was supposed to be exactly what made Jackson and Safechuck's testimonies so hard-hitting and valid in the first film.",False
2,1,Factless and pointless,Stumacs75,n/a,15/08/2025,"A failed second attempt of a ' documentary ' that still doesn't cover the facts surrounding Michael Jackson's allegations.The two proven liars in this along with the desperate director just come across as false and needy for attention.There's also nothing new in this, just the usual sombre violin music played over shots of these men who have back tracked on their support of the deceased popstar.Of course, the future court case will shed a lot more light on the facts surrounding this cash grab than the two past films.And then I believe we are going to be treated to a third, a trilogy of this is beyond a joke.",False
3,2,"If you're looking for the truth... once again, you won't find it here.",amazon-85549,n/a,15/08/2025,"Same as the first so called 'documentary' - all anecdotal and hearsay, absolutely no evidence, nor any attempt to corroborate the facts. Nor any attempt to argue the facts that have been proven against it like the 'Train Station', the 'Grand Canyon' or the 'Mortgage Payment'. Even though Dan Reed does spend time trying to show his own arguments, like the letter 'begging for an interview' - would you give me a break, tbh e directors arrogance here just proves that he thinks people are stupid. I'm not a fan of Michael Jackson by any means, but I'm a fan of the truth which this is anything but.The sensationalist portrayal of the first 'documentary' was successful mostly because of the time, which was the me too movement. Times have changed now and people are so much more educated about the media agenda and that controversy sells more than the truth. I expect a bigger backlash this time.",False
4,1,Doesn't add anything useful,bobmoo79,n/a,15/08/2025,"With the first part we saw two grown men claiming they were abused, and having been rejected by 2 separate judges (admonished for lying by one), were trying to pursue the MJ companies for millions of dollars.During Jackson's lifetime they supported him as children and as adults in court while under oath, on TV, in the press, to friends and relatives. They changed their mind many years after Jackson died and after the statue of limitations ran out on their court testimony.This show adds nothing new. They're still chasing money, still getting nowhere, still can't support their claims with evidence, in fact are still contradicted by court evidence and testimony from people who were there at the time.Either way you look at it, these men are liars. Either you choose to believe their decades of support for Jackson and know they're lying now, or you decide to believe their abuse claims and have to accept they lied as adults while under oath in a courtroom.Finally, these men have publicly declared they're not seeking money but instead want to raise public awareness. So why then are they suing for hundreds of millions of dollars? And why did they initially file their civil claim under seal? Their claims only became public knowledge when the MJ Estate forced it into the public. Again, these men are liars, there's not doubt about it. It's up to you to decide what they're lying about.",False
5,n/a,"Simply, trash",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"More of the same, the same garbage without any foundation as in the first part. If you like to waste time and have an empty head, it's for you.""Leaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson"" - An Exercise in Sensationalism and RepetitionDan Reed returns to the charge with Leaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson, a sequel that not only lacks informative value, but also insists on exploiting a worn narrative without providing strong evidence or new perspectives. More than a serious documentary, this production seems like a desperate attempt to remain relevant at the expense of the memory of Michael Jackson, without any kind of impartiality or journalistic rigor.Repetitive and without new contentIf the first Leaving Neverland was already criticized for its lack of verifiable evidence and its obvious bias, this second part does nothing more than recycle the same testimonies without adding anything substantial. Wade Robson and James Safechuck repeat their accusations, but without providing additional documentation or evidence to support their statements, which makes this ""documentary"" a redundant monologue.Total lack of balance and objectivityA serious documentary should present different perspectives, but Leaving Neverland 2 completely ignores any opinion that does not fit with its narrative. There are no interviews with impartial experts, with lawyers in the case, with Jackson's family or with people who lived with the artist. The absence of any attempt at contrast or rigorous investigation shows that this is not a documentary, but a propaganda pamphlet.Dan Reed's shameless opportunismDan Reed presents himself as a denunciation filmmaker, but in reality he is a mercenary of the scandal. His only objective is to continue squeezing a controversial issue that has generated income and media attention. Instead of searching for the truth, Reed is dedicated to reinforcing a unique version of the facts, ignoring contradictions and elements that could weaken his story.An unfounded attack against someone who cannot defend himselfMichael Jackson is not alive to respond to these accusations, which makes this ""documentary"" even more questionable. It's easy to build a narrative when the other party has no way to defend themselves, and that's exactly what Reed does: presenting testimonies without questioning them, avoiding any serious scrutiny.An opportunistic and manipulative workLeaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson is just an unnecessary and opportunistic replay of his predecessor. Without new evidence, without objectivity and without the intention of thorough investigation, this production is an insult to documentary journalism. Instead of shedding light on the truth, it only perpetuates the morbid and sensationalism. A junk product that doesn't deserve anyone's time.",False
6,7,Forgiving Neverland,paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"This follow up to the acclaimed documentary 'Leaving Neverland' tells of the fight of the people abused by Michael Jackson for legal justice (that abuse having been the subject of the earlier film). The film is short and doesn't waste time repeating the claims made in the earlier film; it's more of an update for those hoping that after its showing, something would be done. Now justice needs to be timely, but it sometimes seems that with sufficient money, you can basically escape the law simply by fighting on every possible point. One can think about the current U. S. President as one example; and the fact that the case against Jackson's estate will not be held until 2026 while Jackson's music continues to make millions for his heirs is surely a sign that something is wrong with the system. Also, why is it socially more acceptable to be a fan on Michael Jackson than of, say, Gary Glitter? Answers on a postcard...",False
7,1,Would zero if I could,imdbfan-1878322745,n/a,15/08/2025,"What absolute dross.Zero factuality, just more sad music and repetitive nonsense, zero explanation of multiple issues raised regarding the first instalment, and the same old circular reasoning of ""it's true because they said it's true"".Despite the multiple issues raised casting serious doubt on these stories, including but not limited to literally alleging an encounter in a building that wasn't built until years after the alleged incident as proven by building permits and photographs, this was not touched upon and instead swept under the carpet in the hopes it would be ignored.I do hope no one watched with the expectation of anything new or logical as it's a complete waste of time.",False
8,7,"Less confronting, but valid",rqrrcqpdy,n/a,15/08/2025,"This wasn't as confronting as the original 'Finding Neverland' documentary. This focused on Wade and James, legal battles following the original documentary release.It made for an interesting watch. I was a little shook at the start when they replayed the accusers' descriptions of the abuse, from the original documentary - this felt unnecessary, as if it was only there for shock value.I would've liked to see how the relationship with Wade and James with their mothers has progressed, however, this was not explored.This Part 2 documentary felt a little rushed and served more as an update to the situation, which is far from over. Instead of interviews with family members and wives, this Part 2 featured interviews with legal representatives. We see more how slowly the wheels of justice turn.Michael Jackson, the man, was a legend like no other; the man was a prolific abuser of boys - both things can be true. This documentary focused on his darker side, but would've benefitted from a more balanced view, especially considering how much he gave to the world.It is difficult not to see the pain in their eyes and to see how much this entire ordeal has ruined every life involved. It's also sad that this is occurring after MJ has passed away, unable to defend himself.A well shot and well paced programme with, what feels like, more to come.",False
9,1,Don't bother!,dalinacristina,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're looking for an objective documentary about Michael Jackson's allegations, this ain't it. No evidence of Michael's guilt is provided, all we get are Wade and James's accounts, that are full of discrepancies. It all seems like a desperate attempt to get more money from Michael's Estate. Dan Reed does not address the issues and lies uncovered in the first part of this ""documentary"" and does not challenge his ""stars"" in any way, something you would expect from an unbiased director, interested only in the truth. Reed's own stance seems to be that of a detractor, reminding very much of the prosecutor Tom Sneddon, who made it his lifetime ambition to hunt and destroy Michael Jackson.",False
10,8,"It Feels Slightly Incomplete, but Still A Great Update on James and Wade's Legal Journey",ManBearPiglet,n/a,15/08/2025,"Okay, this is nowhere near as powerful as Leaving Neverland, yet its not supposed to be either. This is James and Wade's decade-long journey fighting the legal system and getting the their cases to court.Leaving Neverland was 4 hours long, and jampacked with compelling testimony from James and Wade and their family. This one is a little different, with more emphasis on the legal system, and insights from their joint legal team. It also includes interviews from former Santa Barbara and LAPD detectives, and how they believed Michael Jackson was a grave danger to children.Perhaps the biggest hypocrisy, is the fact nobody from the Jackson estate took part in this documentary, despite criticising Dan Reed for not giving them the opportunity the 1st time around. Dan Reed even shows a letter where he ""begs"" them to give their side of the story, yet they all did a disappearing act.And that's my only criticism of this documentary, which is no fault of the director himself. It would have been good, perhaps even amusing, if members of the Jackson estate and family gave their honest opinion, and tried to justify Michael Jackson behaviour, without resorting to the usual ""it's all about money"" claims. But we never get that, and that's perhaps why this documentary feels slightly incomplete, as it could have been another 30-45 minutes longer if those people had taken part.",False
11,1,The Fraud Behind the Accusations Against Michael Jackson,felipesos,n/a,15/08/2025,"Two men who supported Michael Jackson during his criminal trial - one of them even dated the singer's niece for an incredible eight years - conveniently changed their stories years later, turning into ""victims"" seeking money and fame. As if the moral contradiction wasn't enough, one of them was caught in a blatant lie when he claimed to have burned Jackson memorabilia, only for an auction house to come forward and disprove him, proving that he had sold the items. But the fraud doesn't stop there: both claimed to have been abused in rooms at Neverland Ranch that, at the time of the alleged crimes, didn't even exist! This is not just a memory lapse - it is blatant proof that their allegations are fabricated and that the media, conveniently, chose to ignore the glaring contradictions in this story.",False
12,1,Nothing new and full of lies,gridlerbing,n/a,15/08/2025,"Why is this yeah ""documentary"" even allowed to be called a documentary.No balanced view. No new evidence.It's just a cash grab from two washed up, bitter ex friends of Michael Jackson. The court case keeps dragging on with multiple ""amendments (lies)"" to their case each time they are proved wrong.The Acting from these two is wooden to say the least.The first documentary- Leaving neverland was debunked multiple times with provable lies throught so why would a 2nd one be any better?Go and watch square one if you're after the truth.Don't waste your time on this, watching paint dry instead, would be a much better use of your time.",False
13,1,Flogging a dead horse,dean-888-224138,n/a,15/08/2025,"Leaving Neverland has been comprehensively debunked and the 2 men proven to be serial liars who have changed their story numerous times.It's only because of ridiculous Calafornian law that their legal case continues despite been rejected numerous times. Clearly this is all about money and this programme is one sided nonsense and just adds further evidence to the obvious truth that it's just a big scam.When viewing figures were released by channel 4 in the UK it showed a drop of over 75% from LN1, clearly proving people are not interested in these hideous lies.It's obvious the script for their statements (filmed over many takes so they can perfect the 'anguish') is from a deeply disturbed mind and simply designed for maximum shock value.Please do not waste your time even thinking about this other than to write to the broadcaster to complain about it. It makes a mockery of genuine victims.",False
14,2,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,MarcRoston554,n/a,15/08/2025,"This so-called ""documentary"" is nothing but a shameful attempt to revive baseless accusations that have already been thoroughly debunked. It offers nothing new, instead relying on two men who have spent years trying to extort money from Michael Jackson's estate, with no concrete evidence to back their claims-just empty words and fabricated stories. The media's decision to give these discredited figures a platform shows a blatant disregard for the truth and a clear desire for sensationalism. This project is a desperate cash grab, aimed at exploiting a legendary figure's name for profit. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!",False
15,1,Absolutely horrible,imdbfan-4840278662,n/a,15/08/2025,"Where do I even begin with those 2 frauds. Acquitted in court, faced under the largest police investigation on a musician, and countless inconsistencies in the prosecution and STILL they expect people to believe that a little 'mockumentary' made by 2 failing and broke men whose biggest achievement in life was having the privilege of knowing Michael Jackson would sway the general audience. We aren't in 1993 anymore, 2005 and 2019 we are TIRED OF THIS BS. Michael Jackson will forever be an innocent man. Wade, James and Dan, Your recent extortion attempt towards Michael Jackson FLOPPED HARD. MJ already won once 20 years ago and the same will happen next year. IDIOTS.",False
16,1,How the Media Exploits Lies for Money,JohnFrogy11,n/a,15/08/2025,"Don't waste your time watching this one-sided ""documentary"" project, which seems like a desperate attempt to revive baseless accusations. It brings nothing new, just two men who, for years, have tried to extract money from Michael Jackson's estate without success, as they have no concrete evidence, only empty words. It's shameful how the media, hungry for sensationalism, chooses to give a platform to these discredited figures, ignoring the facts and the lack of substance in their claims. This ""documentary"" is nothing more than another piece of manipulation, with the sole purpose of exploiting a name, a legend, to generate profit.",False
17,10,Truth finds a way,zoemz-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"Truth's inherent power cannot be suppressed indefinitely. It persistently seeks avenues to emerge, even amidst resistance. Attempts to conceal or deny truth often prove futile in the long run. The weight of truth eventually overcomes obstacles and reveals itself. Its unveiling can bring discomfort, yet it ultimately paves the way for clarity and growth. This documentary lends crucial weight to the victims' testimonies. The filmmakers meticulously present corroborating evidence, strengthening the impact of the narratives. The careful approach avoids sensationalism, focusing instead on factual details. This measured presentation enhances the documentary's credibility and trustworthiness. Viewers are left with a sobering understanding of the events depicted.",False

It is very disrespectful to make up a story about a great man because of personal and financial problems in the family. Guys, pass by and look for facts.Everyone has known the truth about robson and safechuck for a long time. These two lack money and fame, but you can't build happiness on someone else's grief. I would like someone to think about michael's family. And also, it's strange to use your own children, for the sake of attracting sympathy and empathy of the audience. They should not have been involved here at all, it's at least wrong.",False
19,1,Total Garbage!,imdbfan-3410122677,n/a,15/08/2025,"Without any evidence, just stories that quickly fall apart upon examination, this ""mockumentary"" is a complete waste of time. What is Dan Reed's fascination with this subject if he isn't even going to do any fundamental research on the subject? He can't even be bothered to ask basic questions about the vast inconsistencies in the stories of the accusers and their families? It's basically 3 men, completely and totally obsessed with Michael Jackson, forcing their sick fantasies on the rest of us. They are a disgrace to real victims and their smear campaign against a man who can't defend himself is disgusting. I certainly wouldn't want to be them when their time comes!",False
20,1,Flogging a dea.....horse that they never even had.,imdbfan-3094965564,n/a,15/08/2025,"Leaving Neverland (1) was already an obvious money making scheme jumping on the back of a widely popular but WRONG narrative created by past allegations (mj acquitted in court) and the media.Despite every single accusation in LN 1 being debunked by factual information available on the internet alone, they decided to make a follow up to control the narrative. After being thrown out of court 3 times due to inconsistent evidence or no evidence at all, and the 1st LN being struck off any platform after being sued by the Jackson estate, they needed a second one to at least get the public on their side (which isn't happening).Unlike LN1 they thought the world would stand with them, but since LN1 the accusations have been debunked on a global scale and this ads 0 evidence to the false accusations presented in LN1.They're not flogging a dead horse, they're flogging a horse they never even had.",False

They rely solely on baseless accusations and fabricated stories, with no solid proof to back their claims. This is nothing more than an attempt to sensationalize and exploit a deeply tragic situation for financial profit. Don't be deceived by this manipulative narrative - it's all built on empty words and recycled lies that have long been disproven.

22,1,Don't waste your time to watch more lies,vcbqnjnh,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is basically a sequel to the lies of these two men. The first attempt was destroyed by their wrong timeline of events and their statement that this is not about money. Now they state that they are in a legal battle with Jackson estate. Let's investigate their share of profit, from the documentary....
Shame on Wade especially, who was MJ's star witness in his trial.Michael Jackson was proved innocent on all counts when he was alive and was the no 1 humanitarian in all showbiz. It is inappropriate and to attack a dead man... plus, this is a one sided doc. Like the 1st. Don't waste your time.",False

These accusations are not new, and the stories presented in this documentary have already been debunked in the past. Over the years, attempts to tarnish this man's reputation have been repeatedly refuted, with evidence and thorough investigations proving his innocence. This documentary, therefore, brings nothing new to the table. It only seeks to revive false narratives that have long been discredited, ignoring the clear facts and the truth established by the authorities.

I think let the man rest in peace. I can't believe they made another one. So many young children that also stayed with Michael admitted no wrong. FBI said they watched him for years and no evidence. What new info came out of this doc? Can you please fill me in on the proof? I chose to always believe children but there is something's off here. Very off. Why do a second one with no new information. No new evidence. It was thrown out if court. I don't understand why give them more air time.,False

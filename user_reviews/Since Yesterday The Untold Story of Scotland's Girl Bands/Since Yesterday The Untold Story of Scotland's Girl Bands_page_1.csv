1,8,Labour of Love,derek-duerden,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know that it's still fairly new, but I must say that I'm very surprised not to see any other reviews (yet) of this great slice of history.I've heard of some of these bands, of course, but I'm new to most that are chronicled here. As such, it's informative as well as entertaining and, essentially, allows the protagonists to speak for themselves. Even from the perspective of decades later, most are intelligent, funny, self-deprecating and realistic about their legacy and experiences (some of which are quite horrifying, given the exploitative and patriarchal nature of the business).There's even a nice coda bringing things up-to-date with appearances from some young girls clearly having great fun being part of this and optimistically looking forward to continuing things in their own way.I guarantee that it'll have you scouring youtube to check out more background on at least some of the players.Recommended.",False

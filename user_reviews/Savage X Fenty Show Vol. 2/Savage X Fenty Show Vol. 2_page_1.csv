4,9,If only society was this accepting EVERYDAY.,Sophia-Jones,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love Rihanna and her essence. Her love and attitude are life! I loved this creative showcase and fashion. I'm definitely a fan of all inclusiveness! Show off who you are and what you can do! It will inspire many! Thank you for being a leader in the movement, Rihanna!",False
5,1,Meh,ashleehutchings,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show was so try-hard and expired. Hardly saw what she was promoting. Dances were cringe, camera angles boring. Hyper focused on celebrities over the product. Super meh. I want to see more authenticity and less performance. I didn't catch much flow in this entire show, it was confusing jumping from one extreme to the other in which it lost its taste. Felt like the camera crew were a little overwhelmed with this set lmao. As much as I'm a fan of chaos and energy, a little more flow and synergy felt necessary to be able to fully enjoy watching it. Nonetheless, it was entertaining but if the next one is anything like this I probably won't be bothered to watch again.",False

7,1,Bizarre Weird & Gross,Kamandi73,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the most nauseating show I have ever seen. There are some really gross and creepy dancers grinding the crotches into the camera, and other vomit-inducing close-ups that made me shut this off.The dance routines are horrible. Just boring stuff, and totally amateur. The dancers were the weirdest bunch I have ever seen. The outfits are just bizarre. Between the gross close-ups and the boring dance numbers, it got depressing in a sad way.",False
8,10,THIS WAS EPIC!,jsprauve,n/a,15/08/2025,"The dancing, the music & the models were everything!
Rihanna really did her thing with this show x2! Love her creativity. This woman is a genius! The fact that she's inclusive is so beautiful. I would definitely watch this over & over again. :) I love me some Rihanna.üòäüíó",False
9,10,A beautiful insight into Rihanna's iconic creativity,rubysthom,n/a,15/08/2025,"My girl Rihanna has been my inspiration my whole life, seeing her grow into an entrepreneur has been so exciting! This series is a collection of behind the scenes textile designing, live performances, confronting today's sexual social issues and a fashion show montage of dance and interpretations of the female figure. Film isn't there to please male sexual desire, this is liberation for women",False
10,10,This Is What Diversity and Inclusion Looks Like,lyricalwhip,n/a,15/08/2025,"First off: Wooooooow.
Normally, I'm NOT into lingerie shows simply because none of the lingerie is made in my size. So, I've never seen the Vol. 1 show. I decided to briefly check this show out and I was blown away. It was diverse from beginning to end. Soooo corny, but the depth of diversity brought me to tears. I've never seen anything like it. Different looking people were constantly coming at the camera. Dancers of all sizes were breaking
it
DOWN. They worked for that check. Super synchronized and hype as hell.
The lingerie looked good on everyone and everyone was confident and bold and beautiful.THIS is what diversity and inclusion looks like folls. Although people were different shapes, and sizes, the lingerie looked good on everyone.",False

12,10,"Simply Amazing, The Best!",kowoego,n/a,15/08/2025,"Everything from the dance routines, to the fashion was absolutely breathtaking. I've never seen any brand whose passion for inclusivity and diversity translates to real action. The pieces were absolutely lovely! The models range is something for the books. History was definitely made! Thumbs up to every one involved in it! This is Diversity! Proud to see SavageXfenty being the trendsetter and visionary the world needs. Seeing people of every race, gender and sexuality be in control of their sensuality in a fashion show and be celebrated is something that is going to be referenced for centuries to come!",False

14,10,Legendary,womackjamesdrew,n/a,15/08/2025,Absolutely stunning artistry. Cant speak highly enough about this amazing piece of work. As a dancer I appreciate the high level of skill and execution the dancers presented.,False
15,10,LOVED IT,patiencekellin,n/a,15/08/2025,"Did not only help my attention, but it took me back in time. I was literally mesmerized and entertained and momentarily transferred back in time. I kept going back and back to when I was young and could wear these clothes and then I will go forward and see myself in these pajama outfits and robes. I just loved everything about the show. It was completely amazing when I first saw Rihanna, I remember why everything was so creative and brand new . Keep up the good work keep doing what you're doing. We love it I love the line I love the colors and of course the presentation was amazing. Keep up the good work.",False
16,10,Class,sarahc-47790,n/a,15/08/2025,"Pure class. Survivors support survivors. Love. This show is intriguing and invigorating. I'm excited to be purchasing a few things for myself and for my husband that I saw on the show. Its music meets dance meets fashion meets theater in this. While I was always a fan of Rihanna I never really took an interest in her brand. Hearing that Johnny was going to be in the show made me interested. I'm so proud that this bad ass woman is continuing to pave new roads, stand up for herself- AND to lend a boost to a fellow survivor. The media likes to use social media bots to down play the truth- spewing false narratives.. It would've been easy to let that happen and not use him. To let the trolls take a hold of his story again. Her support is paramount. Her talent flawless. And I'm inspired by seeing two incredible humans coming together for art.",False

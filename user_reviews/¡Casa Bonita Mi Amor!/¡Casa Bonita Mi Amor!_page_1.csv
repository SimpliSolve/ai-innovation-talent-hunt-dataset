1,9,Totally worth it,HypnoticPoison7,n/a,15/08/2025,"First of all, thank you Trey and Matt for taking over Casa Bonita and not giving up on it when you found out how disgusting it was. If you didn't do it, no one would have.Back in 2016 my husband and I were in Colorado to visit Casa Bonita. We were too tired to go and it closed before we had the chance to try again. We always regretted not going and loved that episode from South Park. We didn't grow up going there but did spend time living in Oaxaca and Puebla Mexico so it seemed like the perfect place to reimagine those areas.We visited again in 2023 for our ten year anniversary but were sadly turned away as there was a Willy Wonka ticketing system where you had to get an email invitation to make a reservation. One year later we finally got the email and I told my husband ""We have to go back!"". Just like Cartman, I would do anything to go. We drove there from Kentucky with our parrot and if you ask me if it's worth it, my response will be ""totally"". I wore the perfect pink shirt to match the new paint and even the security guard appreciated it. Once inside, we felt like kids again. You almost get lost trying to figure out how to get to the food, but it's fun. There is so much to do there that I'm not sure we did everything after seeing this documentary! Having our caricature done by a cranky old Welsh guy near the puppet show was my favorite part. We got to hear Trey's voice over the loud speaker announcing the cliff divers and puppet show and it felt so good to feel his involvement. You can hear him in Blackbart's Cave as well. They really did so many improvements that it felt like a new facility, not simply a remake of an old one. The actors were fantastic as well, especially the divers and the dancing they did before the dive. The pirate by the wishing well handed us a coin and told us to make a wish and throw it in. A preteen kid went before us and yelled ""I wish to be cool!"". He hung around for my wish, so I promptly yelled ""I wish to be cooler than that kid!"". That was probably the funniest memory I'll have from that place and need Matt and Trey to know they created the space for me and that kid to have those memories (or scars in his case) for life.If you've been there since the reopening, nothing compares. I recently shot pool with some Denver locals and they complained that the food there wasn't as good as Mexican restaurants nearby. I didn't find this to be true. Our food was pretty great and the sopapillas were fantastic. Our drinks were amazing too. The adults were having as much fun as the kids and that's how you know you've done a good thing. This place is so special and we would gladly go back. It's like a Mexican Meow Wolf. I'm so glad this documentary was made so I can relive the experience.",False
2,8,Love to see a good passion project!,travis-mckeithan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerBeing a lifelong fan of South Park, I knew of the purchase.The hardships and the amount of money they spent to ultimately make Trey Parker's dream come true. I feel like the documentary showed that very well.I almost feel like it could have been multi-episodic with everything that went on during the purchase and renovation. But overall a very enjoyable watch.The pace of the documentary was nice, giving a good back story of the location, the interviews with former owners and staff were beautiful.I can see how important that Casa Bonita is to the greater Denver area, and I really hope to partake next time I am in Colorado.",True
3,10,This really meant something to them!,eddidvd,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was really looking forward to this for a while and it really did not disappoint. Casa Bonita occupies a very special place in Trey and Matt's hearts, but especially Trey. This was very nicely showcased through the home videos from Trey's childhood, and his reminiscing of Casa Bonita's prime in the 70s. This sweet nostalgia had it's ""grip"" on countless Coloradans which explains the outrage at the news of the the restaurant's closure during the pandemic. Trey and Matt undertook the daunting task of reviving this local landmark at a great cost to themselves (financial and mental). Some might have ""cheaped"" out when it comes to repairing a locale of this magnitude, but not them. They ballooned the budget of the project gladly just to make sure everything would be perfect and safe. The documentary goes through the entire arduous process of bringing Casa bonita back to life better than ever, and you can really see they cared.",False
4,10,Nothing compares,mrvault,n/a,15/08/2025,"My dad worked for Conoco and we were transferred to OKC in summer1968, 68-69 being my senior year in HS. The original Casa Bonita (at 39th & Portland - about 5 miles from our house) had just opened and back then it was all you could eat for $1.25 The place was a monster hit and often the lines were insane. As a teenager, I could eat 3 or 4 platefuls of their great food with my favorite being the cheese enchiladas. As their popularity grew, they expanded into nearly Tulsa, Little Rock, Ft. Worth and Denver. The original was not nearly impressive like the Tulsa and Denver locations. At first it was just food and service but later evolved into having (sometimes) live musicians and a costumed monkey that sometimes scared the crap out of the little kids. But it was all fun. The service was so so good. You had a little flag on the table. Raise it and someone would pop over immediately to get whatever you wanted. After the OKC store closed (in 1993 I think), we would often come up with excuses to travel to Tulsa just to eat at Casa Bonita. We were quite impressed by the difference in the Tulsa location and the OKC original. They had caves, cliff divers, puppets, magicians, etc. The food was just as good too. Really bummed us out when that location closed down. After I found out there was still a Denver location, I started looking into it and found the story that it had been on South Park and the guys there had purchased it. Kudos to them and I have to get there for another taste. I can't ever remember happier meals anywhere better than Casa Bonita. Like everything, prices have increased through the years, but I wouldn't hesitate to go to Casa Bonita. This movie reminded me that not all good things have to come to an end. I'm planning a trip there soon.",False
5,6,Colorado's Biggest Kitchen Nightmare,MikeC19,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI grew up watching ""South Park"", and after ""BASEketball"", I found that I really enjoyed Parker and Stone. I'd do stuff like buy ""Team America"" just to watch them in the special features. I knew nothing about Casa Bonita, itself, other than the episode of ""South Park"" it was in, and that it was based on a real restaurant. I gave this a watch, and found most of it quite interesting. I enjoyed seeing the process of the remodel, and seeing what Parker and Stone are like in everyday life. Parker, as it seems is very enthusiastic, and enjoys coming up with ideas, solutions, and such. He can go into ""silly mode"", trying to make those around him laugh over and over, and throw people off with random ideas at the last minute. He *is* likeable, I'd say, though, and his interest in renovating the restaurant for the kids is genuine and noble. Stone was there, and handled finances, but other than some comments about what was happening, did very little in this documentary. He's also likeable, though. I think he laughs more than anyone in this, and that's fun. The manager handling the overall construction clearly did a great job with all he had to handle, and brought some great levity to the documentary. The Spanish lady, ""Loca"", man did she curse a lot. It was super distracting. There's really no reason for that. She was pretty annoying, in my opinion. Overall I just loved to see what happened in this documentary, but unfortunately the end was a real bummer. When Parker realized after all the work was done and they opened, that he couldn't be there a lot, because people would just bug him and want a photo, plus he doesn't live there, it was a downer. He likened himself to Santa in Santa's village. They tacked on another scene at the end, a positive one of him saying something that had been repeated throughout the documentary, but for me, the damage had been done. I was bummed out. It was absolutely fabulous to see the work and effort all these folks put into this place. It'll likely be there for another 50 years, and for all his effort, Parker and the construction staff did a great job, and that job will outlive the documentary. I'm proud of him.",True

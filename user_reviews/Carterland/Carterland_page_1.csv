1,10,Ahead of his time,mf-34858,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFantastic documentary that explores the legacy of Jimmy Carter. A man often derided as a great ex president, this film explores his accomplishments while in office and the personal sacrifices he made did ultimately cost him reelection. Perhaps the last true statesman, who asked americans for self sacrifice during the troubled mid seventies, seeing his devotion to doing what was right now matter the cost is a sobering reminder of how we have lost our way.I was a child during the Carter administration, but I remember the time well. While Reagan now gets credit for many of the accomplishments that Carter instituted, the truth is, the world would be a better place had Carter than reelected.",True

1,9,The Genius of Buster Keaton,MadReviewer,n/a,15/08/2025,"Probably Buster Keaton's best film, and oddly enough, it's not even a straightforward comedy  it's actually an action film, with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure.  `The General', which is set during the Civil War, is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton, of course) who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army . . . and is turned down because the army feels he'd be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier.  However, through a series of misunderstandings, both Johnny's family and his girl think he's a coward, and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier.  Months pass, and Johnny, sad and alone, is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North.  Johnny's efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girl's love  become an unbelievably funny and action-packed series of events, as Johnny tries to go from being a sad-sack buffoon to being a hero.If you haven't watched many silent films, they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal' film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression.  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive, as he's fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye.  While funny, Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well, and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well.  His timing, whether for a joke or for a tender moment, is absolutely impeccable.What's also great about `The General' is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldn't be made today.  No amount of insurance would cover it.  Keaton does all his own stunts, and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General' with a bike, he sits on a moving cattlecatcher, knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own.  All these stunts are fantastic, but it's scary to think that any one of these probably could've killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong.`The General' is a lot more than slapstick.  Personally, I think it's one of the first films to push the envelope of movies  it goes for action, romance, and humor, and it pulls all of those elements together into a terrific movie. If you've never seen Buster Keaton  or, for that matter, a silent film  go find this one and watch it.  It's a classic. A+",False
2,8,Buster Keaton at his best,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's 1861. Johnnie Gray (Buster Keaton) is a train engineer. He loves his train ""The General"" and Annabelle Lee. They won't let him fight in the Civil War because he's needed as an engineer. People tell Annabelle that he's a coward, and she won't speak to her until he's in uniform. A year later, Union spies have captured The General and kidnapped Annabelle intend on recking havoc on the South. Johnnie comes to the rescue.There are some hilarious impossible stunts that Keaton gets into. This is Buster Keaton in his prime. The story is a good melodramatic yarn. There is a lot of amazing train stunt work. The scale of the production is certainly grand. It's not really constant laughs but it is a joy to watch.",False
3,9,It is more appreciated now than when it was released,AlsExGal,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film flopped when it was released in late 1926 for several reasons. First, its premiere was delayed because ""Flesh and the Devil"" was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks. Second, people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian, not Buster the filmmaker and director, which is more of the role he played here. The film was funny, but it was not gag after gag, like so many of Keaton's other films. Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South. A title card declares he has two loves - his girl and his engine. when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist, but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession. His girlfriend misunderstands, thinks him a coward, and says she won't speak to him again until he is in uniform.Meanwhile, the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Buster's train. Unknown to Buster, his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft. Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train, still without the knowledge of his girl's captivity by the Union army.Forgotten with the arrival of sound, the film revived - often cut up from its original length - in the 1950's because Buster didn't preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain. That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today, often with poor video and hideous musical accompaniment.Today The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films, and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too. SHERLOCK, JR. is clever. OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious. The General is both of these things. It's story driven, races to a climax, and is fueled by cute, clever, inventive gags.Buster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in ""A Southern Yankee"".",False
4,10,Understated Perfection,imogensara_smith,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerBuster Keaton once said that if he hadn't been a comedian, he might have been a civil engineer. He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics. It's no wonder he adored trains, the most elegant of machines, and brought them into his movies whenever he could. When one of Keaton's former gag-writers loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War, he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this ""page of history"" to life. His first certainty was that the production had to be ""so authentic it hurts."" He even insisted on using historically accurate narrow-gauge railroad tracks, which he found, along with appropriate landscapes, near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove, Oregon.Most importantly, the area had stretches of parallel tracks, which allowed scenes of Buster on his train-agilely scrambling over the cars, balancing on the roof to scan the horizon, chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind him-to be filmed from another train running alongside. Buster, his train, and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Buster's hair while smoky pine-covered hills rise and fall around him. These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures, and they put to shame all later back-projection and process shots, models and computer-generated effects. The quality of Keaton's film-making is simply-pun intended-unparalleled. Every shot in The General is clean, fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times. The film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional, just like the grave, masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniforms.The General's narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look. Like a train, it stays on track, never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt. All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline. Adapting the historical incident, Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train (Johnnie Gray), rather than one of the raiders. As he saw immediately, The General is one long chase, or rather two chases, structured like the flight of a boomerang. First Johnnie on a borrowed train, the Texas, chases his own stolen train, the General. He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines, pursued by the raiders in the Texas, who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high command.The General is not Keaton's funniest film, but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs. A number of the gags, like the box-car that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks, have a long build-up for a relatively modest payoff. But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe, and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings. The cannon attached to the back of Buster's train goes off just as the train starts around a curve, so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders' train coming out of the curve. Riding on the cowcatcher, Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks, striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way. A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his train's wheels, so lost in thought he doesn't notice when the train starts to move, carrying him up and down in gentle arcs: stillness in motion.I agree with author Jim Kline who describes The General as Keaton's most personal film, the one that best captures his unique vision, spirit and personality. In many of his films, Buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero. But his competent, ingenious and athletic character in The General, who is also modest, tireless, and underestimated, comes much closer to his real nature. There is a shot in The General of Buster's eye isolated on screen, framed by a hole in a white table-cloth, that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertov's kinoglaz, the ""camera-eye."" Keaton melds with his camera; there's no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies. They have the same silence, the same strictness, the same strange blend of gravity and humor.The General might be the most serious comedy every made, but it's not a tragicomedy. That, as in Chaplin's blending of pathos and low humor, was something people took to immediately. But no one knew what to make of The General. Original reviews accused the film of being dull, pretentious, unoriginal, and unfunny. Even today, people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing. The General is challenging because it doesn't flaunt its virtues; like Keaton's concise and economical performance, it holds a great deal in reserve. Take the movie's most famous shot, of a train crashing through a burning bridge, for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train. The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film: he doesn't dwell on it or hype it. Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience, never manipulates, never overplays. He doesn't show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents, nor does he play for sympathy. Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold. But for those who can see the expressiveness of Buster's so-called ""stone face,"" who get his peculiar dry humor, who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed, these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated. Buster Keaton always has more than he's showing; you can see it in his eyes.",True
5,n/a,Loco and Motive,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"No one will top Keaton for physical risk, and risk is what deep film experiences are all about. This might be classed as a comedy, but for me it touches deeply enough. Its about a man who needs to prove himself by taking risks and being true. And its by a man who takes even greater risks and is more true. True to the spirit of the social compact, here displayed as the chummy south.He's always done stunts that amaze. Many of his other films have things in them that if the timing were only a little off, he'd be seriously injured, or die. But this takes the cake. Its almost as if he started with the idea that he'd have three locos to play with and had a year to think up stunts.And the stunts are so physical! And so dangerous. And so, so very effective.His trademark is the deadpan face placed as a sort of innocent cluelessness. Its particularly funny when you see the physical movements and you know that 1) they take incredible preparation and timing to pull off and 2) the fellow you see that looks so puzzled by the reality you see is the guy that devised and directed those stunts.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",False
6,10,The Greatest War Comedy ?,theowinthrop,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is ""generally"" (or should I pun and say ""General Lee""?) said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keaton's career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL. Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects, it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past, but getting the correct rolling stock, costumes, weapons, and props to make it look correct. And it worked so well that Keaton never really could (despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR.) out-do it. In fact, the closest thing to his best sound film (or film that he influenced that was a sound film) was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE, where he returned to a Civil War theme.THE GENERAL (as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE) is based on the ""Andrews Raiders"" stealing of the Confederate locomotive ""The General"", and an attached train, which was used to damage tracks and bridges. The raid (in February 1862) was from northern Georgia into Tennesee. It only lasted 20 miles, as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced. Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial. Others went to southern prisoner of war camps. The effect of the incident far outstripped it's military success. The damage (after all) could be repaired. But like Jimmy Doolittle's Raid over Tokyo in April 1942, it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale. The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky/Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time, and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public. Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhile.Despite it being a brief incident of the war, the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten. The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south. When Lesney did it famous series of ""Models of Yesteryear"" the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was ""The General"".The story, however, was ultimately a downer. But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period. First he changes the viewer's perspective - it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men, but on the Confederates. Secondly, he builds up the story of Johnny Gray, a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected (the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier). Because Keaton's family and girl friend (Marion Mack) see he is not enlisted, they believe he turned coward.Johnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake ""the General"" from the raiders, and the film has actually two chases in it - first Andrews and his men stealing the train, and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking it.Along the way are many comic classic moments, such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train, or when (at a moment of dejection) Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions. The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase, and finding Marion Mack there ""helping"" him, are wonderful - especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired (she throws away the ugly little ones). Keaton's reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful moment.The classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river, and the burning of the railroad bridge (with it's destruction of a second locomotive). It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history. By the way, the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest. He was Mike ""Turkey Strut"" Donlin, a frequent member (and starring player) of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the 20th Century. Donlin (who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases) left baseball to become a film actor (he had worked a bit in vaudeville). Keaton was a sports fan (and showed this in his film COLLEGE, where he shows his abilities in several sports) and hired Donlin. This was the latter's most famous performance - look at his reaction to the collapse.It must be regarded as Keaton's finest film, and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period. It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures.",False
7,10,Deserves its reputation: a masterwork.,Ben_Cheshire,n/a,15/08/2025,"Buster Keaton's love of history, engineering and operatic displays of action are put to their finest use in his masterwork, The General. However unwelcoming the concept of an incredibly accurate historical movie about the civil war may seem, or a title which refers to an army rank, rest assured that The General is imbued throughout with a wonderful sense of fun, as with all Keaton. The pervasive irony running through The General is the fact that little Buster is helping fight the civil war just by happenstance - all he really wants to do is save his girlfriend. The appeal of The General may lie in its ability to take you back to what it would have been like in frontier America, its remarkable visual beauty (incredible cinematography), or possibly Keaton's trademark operatic stunts, the climax of this movie which is one of his most impressive (the famous bridge scene was the most expensive shot in all of silent cinema).But the thing which makes this and all Keaton films a joy to watch is the irrepressible charm and appeal of his onscreen persona. You just can't help liking little Buster, and rooting for him in all the troubles he happens to fall into. 5 stars from me - one of the all time greats.",False
8,9,A wonderful silent movie.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Johnnie Gray is turned down for military action, as his job as a train driver means he's an essential worker. He's forced to take drastic action to retrieve his train, aka The General, when it is stolen.For many years I overlooked silent movies, I always thought they'd not be able to hold my interest, Sherlock Jr and The Great Dictator proved me wrong.The latest masterpiece I checked out was this one, and The General is just that, a masterpiece.I'm not quite sure what you'd class it as, a drama, a comedy, perhaps it's a combination of several different styles.It's fast paced, engaging and pretty thrilling, I was stunned by Keaton's physical stunts, he definitely wasn't afraid to roll his sleeves up, and get do his own stunts, he took several chances, but they definitely paid off.I love Sherlock Jr for its cleverness and the sheer imagination of it, I equally love The General for the effects, pacing and originality of it.It's a classic.9/10.",False
9,10,A Failure - only in it's time,sonofcohen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having read through the various comments on this movie, I find it interesting that no one has yet mentioned that 'The General', Keaton's pinnacle was a flop in it's day.  There are various theories as to why such an excellent film bombed.  Some suggest that the American Civil War was simply too close at heart at the time.  Veterans were immediate family members.  Others suggest that Keaton's choice of making the Hero, Johnny, a southerner was an error.  (If I'm not mistaken, in the book - and true story - that the film is based on, the heroes were not Confederates, making Keaton's choice just a little pondersome.)My pet theory is that Keaton alienated his fans by making a movie that is NOT a comedy.  Funny, oh yes, but not a comedy.  ""Our Hospitiality"" ""Sherlock Jr."" ""Steamboat Bill Jr."" are the sort of films that Keatons fans were accustomed to.  Genuinely funny movies.  But ""The General"" in an adventure.  And in the context of silent film, it is an excellent adventure. (By today's standards it is structurally weak.)  But it is not hysterically funny like most of the films in Keaton's main canon.  His fans didn't know how to take it.  And as a result it made considerably less money than his previous movies had.  Keaton followed ""The General"" with the more conventional ""College"" and financially speaking returned to the world of successful filmmaking.Today - indeed since the resurfacing of Keaton's classics (In the late 1950s?) - we see ""The General"" from a distance.  It is with this perspective that we see that it is in fact his best film.  Amongst it's accomplishments ""The General"" is chock full of his most ingenious business and stunt work. The only stunt which rivals anything in ""The General"" would be the house collapsing on him in ""Steamboat Bill Jr."" and there are those who will argue that the bridge collapsing under The Texas is more spectacular.  I have to say that this is simply wrong.  Both are heart stopping stunts.  But the house collapse seriously endangered Keaton's well being.  (Possibly apocryphally, all of his crew except the cameraman left the set 'cause they ""couldn't stand to watch.  The cameraman closed his eyes hile he cranked.) The destruction of The Texas was then the most expensive shot in film - and may still be in adjusted dollars. (Probably not.)  But nobody was imperiled by the stunt.  Nobody was actually in the train.",False
10,10,General Rapture,marcslope,n/a,15/08/2025,"Other viewers have pointed out this beautiful movie's visual, comedic, and dramatic strengths, so I'll just relate a particular moment. Keaton's character must keep the engine running at all costs, and he's furiously shoveling wood into the furnace. His girlfriend taps his shoulder, and idiotically hands him a tiny twig to feed it. He threatens, for a split second, to beat her senseless with it. Then he kisses her. Then he gets back to the immediate business of keeping the train going.Well, there you are. It's funny, it's tender, it's original, and I get teary thinking about it. Also note how visually sumptuous the movie is (as were a lot of late silents), like a series of Matthew Brady war photos in motion. Keaton never overdoes sentiment -- if anything, like his character, he shies away from it -- and yet it's an unusually heartfelt comedy, with the gravity of war and the sanctity of romance never very far beneath the surface.For what it's worth, the film wasn't that well reviewed at the time, and didn't perform very well at the box office. They had philistines then, too.",False
11,7,"""If you lose this war, don't blame me"".",classicsoncall,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI would have eventually gotten around to watching this film, but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number #17 on the 2007 version of AFI's Top 100 Movies of all time list. It didn't make the cut at all for the original compilation in 1997, so even before seeing the picture, I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion. I usually line up with the majority in most cases, but I have to admit, I don't quite get it with this picture. I found it entertaining enough on occasion, but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way it's heralded on the DVD sleeve. I don't think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy, so right there my expectations were greatly reduced. Keaton's somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition don't help. On the flip side, I wouldn't have expected slapstick to move the story along either, so at least I wasn't disappointed in that regard.What I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity. When Johnnie Gray (Keaton) dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army, and pondered his situation while sitting on the train's connecting rod, the resulting visual was pure genius. The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnie's thoughtful reverie, and was one of the highlights of the picture for me.The other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge. For starters, I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive. Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film, and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb - unbelievable.Oh yes, and I can't forget the sequence where Keaton's marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks, flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own. Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a pre-CGI world, it's difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed, particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own. For that, Keaton deserves accolades.In between all this clever film making however, I just wasn't inspired. The central plot element doesn't hold up for me - if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer, why wasn't he simply told the reason why. One could argue that then, you wouldn't have a picture, but for me it left the story on a shaky footing. If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier, the picture might have taken a different approach, but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero. Maybe I'm second guessing a master, but that's what I come away with.Conclusion - if this movie didn't make AFI's Top 100 Film List in 1997, I don't understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top 20. At the same time, Chaplin's ""City Lights"", in my estimation a superior silent film, fell OFF the list, while ""The Gold Rush"" moved up a few notches. I may not be a professional, but I know what I like, and this one just didn't do it for me.",True
12,9,Locomotive Majesty...,Xstal,n/a,15/08/2025,The locomotive majesty of silent motion pictures amplified tenfold by the genius of Buster Keaton.,False
13,6,The Locomotion,Prismark10,n/a,15/08/2025,"To me Buster Keaton is more unknown compared to his other silent era rivals like Harold Lloyd or Charlie Chaplain whose work were shown more often on British television. Maybe Chaplain is more appreciated in Britain because he was British.The General is an epic silent comedy and at the time was an expensive undertaking comprising of many extras, dangerous stunts and a steam engine falling from a burning bridge.Set during the Civil War Keaton plays a devoted train engineer called Johnny Gray who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army to impress his girl and is turned down because he is more valuable as an engineer but no one tells him that was the reason.His girl think he is a coward who refused to join and will have nothing to do with him until he shows up in uniform. Some months later his beloved steam engine his stolen by Unionist soldiers and in a serious of escapades he tries to recover it and also rescue his girl.It is an elaborate chase film with for the time some clever sequences and slapstick. However it does go on too long as a chase film and despite some flourishes it does not showcase Keaton's acrobatic skills as much as I desired.The film was inspired by a true incident but to a modern viewer you still feel ill at ease that even 90 years ago the Confederate South was somehow being painted as heroic.",False
14,5,Meh,yzelig,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWell made but didn't do anything for me. I'm a casual cinephile and this wasn't worth the effort of forcing myself to watch a silent movie.Not that there aren't great silent movies, of course there are! Maybe I need more exposure to get used to them but I found that this film didn't grab my attention. I found the first thirty minutes or so to be rather boring as the comedy really didn't land for me. Burster Keaton' deadpan face doesn't translate well in a film where you can't hear him speak

15,n/a,Richly inventive comedy with a logically impeccable plot that makes the hyperbolic slapstick seem plausible and inevitable; this is a work of art and a work of genius,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Buster Keaton's ""The General,"" about a man and his engine, puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen. From major comic situations to throwaway gags, ""The General"" always knows what to do.The story begins in leisurely fashion. A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray (Keaton) has two loves in his life: his engine and his girlrespectively, The General and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle, followed by two engineer-worshipping boys and, unknown to him, Annabelle Lee herself. He and his entourage arrive at the door; Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs, slicks back his hair, and gently taps the door with the door knocker. Then he turns to notice Annabelle. Keaton's understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness. Any other comedian would have done an explosive double-take.Now Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor, but the boys are there, too. Johnnie stands up, puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave. The hero-worshippers are ready to follow, but Johnnie lets them out first, then closes the door on them. This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy. At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pants.Now the two are alone. Annabelle's father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon: the War Between the States has begun. Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist, then turns expectantly to Johnnie, who cocks his head like a confused puppy. She asks, ""Aren't you going to enlist?"" Realization hits him, and he leaps off the seat. Before he can run out the door, Annabelle kisses him. This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porch.Johnnie races to the general store, which is now a makeshift recruitment office. Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line. The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions, and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again. He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation, but the man rejects him. Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer. Later, Annabelle believes that Johnnie didn't even try to enlist. She refuses to speak to him again until he's in uniform. What follows is a classic moment: Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine. He's so miserable that he doesn't notice when he starts moving up and down, until just before the train enters a tunnel.Time passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General. When (nearly) everyone is off the train having dinner, the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine. Annabelle, a passenger herself, was still on board. She is now their prisoner.But Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen, possibly by deserters. He pursues the engine by taking another, The Texas. Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas, but the Unionists think they're outnumbered and continue to run. What follows is the true joy of the movie: two long chases (separated by an important plot twist). Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop action.I love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas. At one point, the car, which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track, reappears in front of the baffled engineer, only to disappear later just as mysteriously. We see the logical circumstances that lead to the car's seeming magic act, and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied, preventing him from seeing what we see.Comic logic is important to ""The General."" In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable. In a throwaway gag, Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack. Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for it.We move to the second chase, where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him. Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle Lee.Marion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen. She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it. Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around, trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was. She has hilarious moments. The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine. An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire. She takes a small stick and daintily puts it in. Johnnie sarcastically hands her a sliver, and she puts that in, too. Then, in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping, Johnnie grabs her and half-throttles her before kissing her instead.The final section, most of it a battle scene, includes the shot where The Texas begins to cross a burning bridge, only to crash into the river. Owing to Keaton's disdain of fakery (one of several reasons his works seem modern) he did not use a model but a real train on a real burning bridge. The crash cost $42,000reportedly making it the single most expensive shot ever in a silent film.A worthy closing gag was too taxing even for Keaton's ingenuity. Johnnie's dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers. His remedy is only mildly funny. Is anyone complaining? ""The General"" is a work of art and a work of genius.",False
16,10,One of the greatest silent pictures ever.,braddugg,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of the greatest silent pictures ever.It's a film that's mostly made on a train. The name of the protagonist is ""The General"". Well, the protagonist is non other than the train itself. So ""The General"" is the name of the train and not of our hero Buster Keaton who is named as Johnnie Gray.The storyline is pretty simple, it's a lover's test to prove his love. He applies for a job in military during the civil war of 1860's and is rejected. His girlfriend thinks he is unfit. He must disprove this and win his lover. The train acts a protagonist and the binding force in their love story. It's the one that brings them together. How? Well, go watch the film and I am sure you will have a laugh out loud them. I recommend that it's a must watch and please do it with all your family together.It's a laugh riot and a meaningful one. There are layers to this, emotions, love and above all a cute silliness that can be embraced effortlessly.Buster Keaton performs all the stunts by himself and stands tall in each one of them. Considering the fact that this was made in 1926, the content is original and we have seen only films inspired by this and made many years later. So this is one of the first films made entirely on a vehicle and the trip is not just fun, it's funny, lovely and supremely wonderful.I loved this film and will watch it many times over and will pass on to the next generation too. A 5/5 for one of the greatest films made in the history. There are many that will be made, but this will be the original.",False
17,10,An instant favorite,vovazhd,n/a,15/08/2025,"I haven't had so much fun watching a movie for a long time. The General is a silent comedy (mostly slapstick) about Johnny Gray, a train engineer with two loves: his engine and Annabelle Lee. Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War (they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer). Things are then sped up a year, where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan. As it so happens, they steal Johnny's engine, a big mistake.Buster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny. His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy. He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies (but, of course, less old). He is often ignorant of what is going on around him, leading to plenty of laughs. This also makes him a very charismatic character.There are countless train related jokes. The first one comes right at the beginning, when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman, in a line much like a train. The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train, either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers. The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful. The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment. The finale is explosive.The General was a lot of fun to watch. It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies, and had plenty of substance on top of that. This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever. After my first viewing, it instantly became one of my favorites. It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies.",False
18,9,"""Undoubtedly the best train film ever made""",Bored_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"I do not like silent movies, but this one held my attention from the beginning to the end. I was so preoccupied with it that I didn't even smoke one cigarette. Train chasing during the civil war in America, a comedy that deserves at least 7/10 at today's standards, and considering that this is a silent film from 1926...9/10",False
19,9,The Great Locomotive Chase,lugonian,n/a,15/08/2025,"THE GENERAL (United Artists, 1926), written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman, is an acclaimed comedy masterpiece from the bygone silent era that is essentially a Civil War comedy, or, a comedy set during the Civil War reportedly based on the historic Andrews Raid. THE GENERAL isn't the military rank of Keaton's on screen character, but actually one of the two loves of his life: his locomotive called The General; and his girlfriend, Annabelle Lee (Marian Mack).In a prologue that begins in Marietta, Georgia, in the year 1861, Johnnie Gray (Buster Keaton) is a train engineer who finds time to court Annabelle Lee (Marian Mack). While at her home, her brother (Frank Barnes) barges in with the news that Fort Sumpter has been attacked, thus the start of the war between the states. Annabelle's brother rushes out to enlist into the Army. Expecting Johnnie to enlist for the Southern cause, Annabelle becomes disappointed with him when she is told by her brother that Johnnie didn't even bother to go on line, but in reality, has tried to enlist and was turned down for service because he is believed more valuable as a railway engineer. But poor Johnnie hasn't even been told of his rejection. Spurning him a coward, Annabelle breaks off her engagement with Johnnie. A year later, Captain Anderson (Glen Cavender), a Northern spy, makes plans on disguising himself as a Southern civilian, and, along with his followers, seize a Confederate locomotive to head North in order to destroy all communication lines along the right of way. The Union seize The General, and Annabelle, who happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Being a witness to the abduction, the great chase begins when Johnnie pursues the enemy by taking another locomotive to rescue Annabelle, which takes him to enemy lines. After saving Annabelle and retrieving his own locomotive, the chase resumes in reverse when Johnnie finds himself being pursued by the enemy, later climaxed by a well staged gun battle with the Confederate Army by his side.What makes THE GENERAL so essentially remarkable is that it's a straight forward story based on fact, and listed among one of the greatest comedies of all time. Keaton takes actual occurrences and builds comic gags around it. While he and his co-star, Marian Mack, each play helpless individuals, both perform their roles seriously and succeed into making their characters both real and funny. Keaton's confused facial gestures are more than enough to make this a worthwhile ride of fun.THE GENERAL is full of memorable highlights, including Keaton's attempt to utilize a cannon to attack the enemy train ahead that slowly lowers itself into aiming directly at our hero; Keaton losing the use of his handcar and seizing a bicycle with a huge front wheel, and not going very far with it; and a tense moment where, while being pursued by the enemy, Keaton, who safely reaches the other side by riding his locomotive across a wooden bridge, gets off to set fire to it, with the fiercely Union general giving command to the train's engineer to proceed across the burning bridge, only to soon realize that it will not hold up under the crossing; among others. Reportedly filmed on location and not in a studio back-lot, THE GENERAL captures the period flavor from the Civil War era, providing laughter in what would not be common place for comedy.Also seen in the supporting cast are Charles Smith as Annabelle's father; James Farley as Captain Thatcher; Frank Hagney as the Recruiting Officer; and Joe Keaton as a Confederate Officer.THE GENERAL, hailed as Buster Keaton's personal favorite of all his movies, which was not critically acclaimed at the time of its release, became one of 13 selected feature films shown on public television's 1971 presentation of THE SILENT YEARS, hosted by Orson Welles, with a copy print from the Paul Killiam collection and piano score by William P. Perry. Over the years, THE GENERAL has stood the test of time, winning new viewers of appreciation to this now Keaton masterpiece. Later distributed on video cassette by various distributors (and later DVD), THE GENERAL can be seen in either in black and white or with color tints, different time lengths (the majority being at 76 minutes), and with different music tracks, ranging from organ to orchestra l scores. However, the best way to see and really appreciate this production is to locate an old 1980s Blackhawk Video copy the William P. Perry piano score, the print with the score that's sometimes presented on SILENT Sunday NIGHTS on Turner Classic Movies. (****)",False
20,8,Keaton is one of the very best,willcundallreview,n/a,15/08/2025,"When you explore the world of silent movies you not only expect only music playing but also a world where physicality makes up for dialogue. The General of 1926 is one of those where its lead actor Buster Keaton seems to communicate with us the viewer via stunts, by also using his stone wall facial expressions but also utilises his surroundings to bring us laughs, but also just a sense of awe in how he does these things. In a day when doing production on a big scale was difficult, The General succeeds in bringing us massive crashes, great little things here and there for Keaton to use to get us to smile and of course a fantastic use of slow moving trains(who knew trains going 10mph could be so fun).I went into watching the movie with high expectations; after all it seems everybody who see's this comes off with a sense of them seeing something amazing. The film for me was maybe not perfect in fact quite a bit from it but I did find the movie to be a great one and coming to that conclusion took me quite a little while. I finished it thinking ""You know it was good but nothing like what people say about it"", but then it came to me the day after seeing this that this is more than good, it is very good and a movie that I really liked. The reason that came to me was Keaton who to me now is the master of doing your own stunts and succeeding, Buster Keaton gets all my praise and he actually makes this rather dull at times plot a hundred times better.So what does that plot have to offer? ,well not an awful lot to be fair although it does give you a few thrills coupled with laughs here and there but never gut busting in my opinion. The story is set in the American civil war of the 19th century, we see Buster Keaton as a train engineer turned down by the Confederacy because he is just too important in what he is doing (but no one bothers to tell him that). Keaton's character of Johnnie Gray has trouble though, Union spies are coming and they plan to steal a train and intend to burn all the bridges back towards their lines. The story of course has much more to that but it really is the kind of movie you just have to watch yourself to see what happens because well for a film like this, a lot happens.Buster Keaton alongside Clyde Bruckman directs this and does a great job yet again, not only is Keaton a fine actor but at directing and even partly the writing too he is just one fine silent movie creator. I think his skills come out most with Bruckman also when he is doing the of course famous stunts he did himself, it is not only the biggest I enjoyed the most though such as the him sitting on the train wheels as they move, just fantastic. When Keaton runs around the train he is fantastic but at times he runs from the end of the carriages to the front and jumps and grabs onto things and just propels himself into the right place, how he never broke his entire body I will never know but the added speed of the movies of the day makes this even more beautiful to see.If you're coming to silent movies as a new viewer or if you consider yourself a connoisseur of the era then both can enjoy this, is it Keaton's best work? , well some will say yes and me myself actually say no for now. What really shows how good Keaton can be is the fact that this movie is considered one of the best silent movies ever and yet could maybe be outdone by some of his other work. That previous point proves to me not only is Keaton one of the finest actors and maybe even directors of the silent's, but also that he could travel forward in time and fit right in with the movies of today.",False
21,10,Keaton is in top form,planktonrules,n/a,15/08/2025,"I just wrote a review for STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. and that makes this review VERY difficult, because I really can't decide which of these two films is better. To me, they are both nearly perfect and represent the best full-length material Keaton performed--at least when it comes to stunts and laughs. It's sad really, as just after these two triumphs came the sound era--and a seriously negative down-turn in Keaton's career, as MGM repeatedly gave him terrible material--pairing him with the brash and inappropriate humor of Jimmy Durante.This film is probably the best of his films when it comes to concept and consistency of the plot. And, for once, I have nothing critical to say about the film. No matter how many times I see it, it just seems perfect. This might just be my favorite silent comedy--period. It's that good. However, as this IS more plot-driven than most of his films, don't expect the rapid-fire laughs--there is a lot of set-up and story instead. This is NOT a complaint--just don't expect the pacing of his shorts--which, incidentally, you won't find in any of the full-length films.By the way, while all is practically perfect in every way about this film, this is NOT my favorite Keaton full-length film. While not as funny or filled with amazing stunts, OUR HOSPITALITY is an amazing film for its artistry. In addition to being the prettiest of his films, it also features among the best characterization for Keaton--with a full and rich plot. My advice is to see THE GENERAL and OUR HOSPITALITY and see two very different and probably equally great films from a master.",False
22,7,"Good, although I don't like it as much as I'm supposed to",cherold,n/a,15/08/2025,"Keaton considered this his best movie, but it was a financial and critical disappointment at the time. While its reputation has increased considerably, I find myself in agreement with the original reviewers. It's a well-made big-budget movie, but it's not Keaton's funniest by far.The movie deftly combines action and comedy, and there are some suspenseful moments amidst the slapstick. Keaton's physical skill is remarkable, although at times this made his gags more impressive than funny.The movie is pretty solid, but it lags towards the end as it gets into big war scenes that sometimes overwhelm the drama. It also made the movie less sympathetic; I can cheer for the little engineer more easily than I can cheer the Confederate army.Anyway, a good movie, but not nearly my favorite Keaton.",False

24,7,Amusing and fast-paced story based on true-life incidents in the American Civil War,ma-cortes,n/a,15/08/2025,"A fun tale of a lad, a lass and a locomotive. After being rejected by the military Confederate , Buster Keaton goes into action by taking a locomotive and while destroying the Confederate railway system along the way. As Buster drives The General to trainload of laughter. His First United Artists Picture. Love, locomotives and laughs. Join the Laugh Brigade. Enlist for fun with the commander-in-chief of laughter. Pass with your train-load of thrills, hilarious joy and side-splitting mirth. The laugh hit spectacular of the year. A true-life spy story of ultimate suspense. High speed and inconceivable bravery!Universally acclaimed as one of Buster Keaton greatest feature films, including a meticulous attention to period detail, this is based on a novel titled The Great Locomotive Chase 1956 , filmed under that title by the Disney organization and directed by Francis D Lyon with Fess Parker, Jeffrey Hunter. Being based on an actual incident in the Civil War about an engineer determined to recapture his stolen locomotive. A solid script, excellent battle scenes are mere backdrops for Buster Keaton's inspired set pieces and amazing acrobatics. A funny historical yarn with several sight gags to embellish this lavish period piece. It is a stunning action comedy set during American Civil War , containing thrills , adventures, ingenious stunt work, comic spills and lots of action, all of them make this film above average .The motion picture was competently written, acted and directed by Buster Keaton at his best. Buster Keaton made various magnificent silent movies, such as Hard Luck, Our hospitality, Shelock Junior, The Navigator, Go West, Seven Chances, Battling Butler, among others. Rating 7.5/10. Better than average. The movie will appeal to Buster Keaton fans.",False
25,5,Incredibly impressive visuals but totally lacking in story,spdowling,n/a,15/08/2025,"Buster Keaton's The General(1926) would not be made in this day and age, at least not with the use of a real moving locomotive. Keaton risked life and limb performing many amazing and dangerous practical stunts on and around the moving train that provided for a great spectacle but without a strong story and strong characters the film becomes little more than a series of spectacular but meaningless stunts. The real love affair of the picture is between Johnny Gray and his beloved locomotive, The General. The Annabelle character is so shallow and empty that it becomes impossible to believe that Johnny would care at all about winning back her affections. Indeed, Johnny cares far more about getting his train back from the Union Army than he does about winning back Annabelle but the human love story just left this reviewer feeling cold.It was rather surprising to see the film portray the Confederate Army as noble and righteous while portraying the Union Army as bumbling and clueless but the point of view lacked gravity and meaning as the grave circumstances behind the US Civil War were totally ignored. The simplistic ""us vs. them"" view of this momentous and tragic chapter of American History does a great disservice to the men, women and children on all sides who lost their homes and lives in the war. There is certainly a place for comedy in the horrors of war, as Chaplin brilliantly demonstrated in The Great Dictator(1940), but Keaton's failure to show any of the depth of the historic events of the time left me unsatisfied and a bit annoyed by the treatment of the US Civil War. I have a hard time understanding the near universal praise for The General(1926), to me the picture is akin to a modern film that has incredible action scenes but zero story.",False

1,10,"Excellent program, corruption exposed.",sandyinsm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought this program was excellent. The corruption that was brought to light, I think might be critical in solving the case. I'm hoping that the new chief of police will be able to get more information now that the last corrupt one is now in jail.Update: Indeed, the police have FINALLY released the voice recording of Shannan Gilbert and that does bring up questions in my mind. One has to listen to her and draw their own conclusions but to me she seems drugged and contradictory. She is afraid of her driver and then says things like she is not afraid of him. I would draw the conclusion that she was hallucinating and agree with the police that her case has nothing to do with the other murders as weird of a coincidence as that would be EXCEPT Dr. Michael Baden said her hyoid bone was broken and that doesn't happen by falling or drowning, it occurs with strangulation. So to me this point to Michael Pak. She hired Michael Pak for protection and to drive her out there, could he have been a driver for the other victims? However, this isn't new to the police, and apparently they do not suspect him.",False
2,9,Fascinating and disturbing,zinitime,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI knew of the Long Island murders, but very little about them, other than they are still not solved. I watched this documentary believing that I might hear more, and, hopefully, a resolution to the crime. Though the crimes are still unsolved, I learned a great deal of disturbing information about the police department of NY Suffolk County, and its District Attorney's office. It made me very glad that I didn't live there! The corruption at top levels was incredible. I pray that they truly have cleaned things up, but....... It is stories like this that make people distrust the police and our criminal justice system. And that is another tragedy! They promoted scum, unworthy of their positions.This is a fascinating, and tragic story. It's time to find the Long Island killer(s), and get rid of the corruption.",True
3,1,Nothing New,leighverwey,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw a more informative show on ID. They only exposed the corruption that was clearly apparent on ID. It was a waste of a good hour. How do ""journalists "" even get the air time.",False

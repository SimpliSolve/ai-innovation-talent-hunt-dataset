1,8,Thailand Wildlife,andybastian-82716,n/a,15/08/2025,"As someone who spends a considerable amount of time photographing wildlife across Thailand's national parks, I found ""Thailand's Wild Cats"" to be a compelling and enchanting documentary. It is an exceptional watch for anyone who cherishes nature, wildlife, and the raw beauty of Thailand's landscapes. This documentary not only showcases the mesmerizing beauty and diversity of Thailand's feline species but also mirrors the many wonders and challenges I've personally witnessed in the wild. The cinematography is outstanding, with each shot meticulously crafted to capture the essence and majesty of these wild creatures in their natural habitat in Thailand. I recommend this documentary to people who frequently travel to Thailand's national parks as hobbyist wildlife photographers.",False
2,6,Surprising low quality,abomai-14780,n/a,15/08/2025,"I assumed that NatGeo would improve after being bought by Disney, but it didn't. Most of the cat scenes are boring and made in captivity. I only gave it six stars because the banteng and peacock scenes are good.",False

1,10,A great and heart warming documentary!,bigjaxal,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNot gonna lie... when i was maybe 20 mins in, i thought this will end with something like 'and then we never heard from him again' kinda thing loll but by the end it was just amazing to see how all his work paid of and made a difference for the birds of the island.Although i dont understand why this job was executed this way. I mean surely there would not have been a problem to have 3 or 4 people who are rotated out every month or something like that.. why did it have to be 1 guy, allllllllllll by himself on an island? That is the only bit that didnt made sense for me. I mean, im sure even back then people knew the effect of long term living alone... it makes people feel some way. Really dont understand why it was done this way. Felt completely unnecessary..But good on the guy for sticking it!! Amazing work!",True
2,10,Psychological and Spiritual evolution,Silentium_Tremendum,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very usefull documentary. For me especialy, bc i had similar experiences in some way, so i can relate to him a lot.Also this docu shows a lot about living in isolated environment. Its actually very helpfull and educational about that subject much more than it is about birds and other animals which is main focus of this video. Ofc that animal side is also very educational, but for me personaly, psychological and spiritual side was in my main focus and that was the main reason i wanted to see this docu.I dont mind nothing about this docu, and im very gratefull for the honesty, especially hardships which main character was going through.Ty for this video.",False

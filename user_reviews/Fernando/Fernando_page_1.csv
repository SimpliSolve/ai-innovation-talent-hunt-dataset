1,7,The other face of Fernando.,odaleg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent documentary to learn about the last years of Fernando Alonso, since he retired from F1 until his return. We get to know the person behind the car and how his competitive personality has been formed over the years since he was a childhood kart champion. The negative point is that his entire career in F1 is ignored to focus on the years that he has not been in it. This causes us to miss the most important years in her career and events such as the conflict in Mclaren or the world championships.",False

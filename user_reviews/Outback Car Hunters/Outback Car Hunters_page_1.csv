1,8,Different From Other Restoration Shows. But I Really Enjoy It!,collectorofsorts,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm in the US and enjoy quite a few Aussie shows. I also watch quite a few restoration shows. So, I'm used to the norm. This one is a little different. But, it's every bit as enjoyable. Each episode has them hunting up two vehicles to restore. And, n most episodes, they sell them at the end of the show and tell us how much they made on the deal. Keep in mind that we're not talking museum quality restorations here. They're restoring them for people who actually use them. Daily driver quality stuff. I've watched about half of the season so far and I would highly recommend it.",False
2,7,"Nice show, but",tedthorne,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nice light entertainment, but not always accurate.Episode Ford Capri & Holden Commodore (Season1 Episode 10) and they have incorrectly claimed that the first Holden was built in 1951. BEEP WRONG
First Holden was in 1948, and was launched under Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley on 29th November 1948. It was officially designated ""48-215"", the car was marketed simply as the ""Holden"". The unofficial usage of the name ""FX"" originated within Holden, referring to the updated suspension on the 48-215 of 1953.[Holden was named after Sir Edward Holden, the company's first chairman and grandson of J. A. Holden.",False
3,7,Better that that!,carsstarters,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nice show. In hospital and only just caught up with it. Too bad they only got one season out of it. It was worth more than that, I thought. Odd the boys didn't fess up to who they really are. Neither of them are shrinking violets. Not in my experience. Dave, the one with the ZZ Top beard and superglued hat, is of course the acerbic Mr David Morley and GT is the inimitable Glen Torrens, both of them established motoring journos from way back. Love the beard Dave. Still got the VW bus. It was a bus wasn't it? GT is also a VW tragic and drag racer. If you want to know more about these bad boys, look 'em up.",False
4,10,Love this series! Outback + adventure + cars + laughs = winner,nathanegibbs,n/a,16/08/2025,This series is awesome! It's a hybrid between pickers and a car resto show. It's different but it works. The guys are funny and the car makeovers are cool. I'm a fan! Love it.,False
5,10,Jeremy Clarkson this is how you do it!,trixietigger-97421,n/a,16/08/2025,"Best car show in ages. Great scenery of the Australian outback. There's true blue Aussie characters, interesting old cars, and the really good point?They actually restore the cars or get them restored! I'm impressed with the thought and the work that into making this show.Bring on season 2! There must be a heap of barn or desert finds still out there waiting.",False
6,9,Honest to goodness regular guys,chdoyle-65848,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like the hosts of this show more than any American car hunter show. No pretentious bad boy American wannabes looking for cars to fix up for the Barrett auctions or for the Jay Leno type buyers with bottomless pockets and acres of cars in storage. They seem like regular guys trying to run a business in a job they love. I'm not a car guy but something about this show clicked with me. There's no back room scams like Storage Wars, just two car lovers searching to buy decent vehicles
and sell them for a little profit. I've seen most of season one and I'm hoping for a season two and beyond. Definitely one of my Discovery Channels go to shows.",False
7,1,Wheeler Dealers it isn't,linuxrulesok,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're looking for hints and tips on how to fix your car, this show isn't for you.I endured the 1st episode so that you don't have to.Basically two guys driving around Australia buying cars and showing absolutely nothing technical.Avoid.",False
8,1,The English do it better,sweetdrums,n/a,16/08/2025,"No technical skills are shown, basically two blokes driving around the outback looking for old cars.Reminds me of a great English show. Earily similar now I think it.",False
9,1,Worst ever,lesleyevers,n/a,16/08/2025,"No rain means no rust
In europe we recycle them at the scrapyard
The mini moke or that vw bus should never go on the road again EVER
If u hit a tree at 20 mile an hour u probably wont survive.Giving it a lick of paint is not a restoration what about structural strenght.",False
10,1,Cowboys,callgem,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGeez
What a couple of clowns.No technical ability no safety taken into consideration lol.Half the cars should never be anywhere the road again.Brakes X suspension X steering X
Steam clean coat of rough paint job.No.idea how they get away with it selling cars to the public.Be the perfect show to watch or show people how not to do it.They talk about hitting the niche market. Lucky they don't end up in jail with some of the scrap they pass on after they are done with it.Would be very interesting to see if any of the two of them have any kind of trade qualification. If they do must have been out a show bag.",True

1,9,Powerful and hopeful tale of survival,reedm-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"An impressive work of historical research and filmmaking to uncover this remarkable story of a family sibling group after their parents are arrested in WWII and saved by common heroic farmers during the Second World War in Germany. Through the use of archival footage, moving interviews, and creative animation the director tells the story of how her family survives, is separated, then finds each other again and celebrates the simple farmers who risked their own lives to save them.The music and ancillary characters add much to the telling of this story. Where actual footage is absent the filmmaker employs creative animation techniques.",False
2,10,"Astonishing legacy, incredible story and film",LaurieK-96,n/a,16/08/2025,"I finally had the opportunity to sit and watch this entire film. What an incredible legacy you've given your family and the importance of their story (your story and those that follow!) never being forgotten. Honestly I can barely think or breathe right now. It is such a horrifying / beautiful / heartbreaking / and yet supremely brave and loving story. A brilliant tribute to your family and, of course, the importance of these stories never being forgotten.I have seen zillions of film from this time period but never have I followed the story of seven siblings in this way.YOU, created something so AMAZING.",False
3,10,A beautiful hopeful film,diwechter,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first night, after Beth Lane's documentary, I could not stop crying - although I'm not exactly sure why. But the film was so incredibly beautiful!! And Beth is such a warm and amazing soul. The experience of seeing the film and meeting Beth (who took one look at me and said, ""This woman needs a hug!"" and then grabbed me into her arms and rocked me as I cried - I just cannot explain it, but I will never ever forget it!) And I will say, it is the first time I have ever seen a film involving the Holocaust and was not depressed throughout. These survivors created such hope - it was amazing. (I was crying, but I was definitely not depressed.) I hope that the whole world has the chance to see this film full of hope and humanity. Or at least all of my family and friends!!!!",False
4,6,Seven Jewish siblings saved from the Holocaust,jenseeli,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary moved a little too slowly for my taste. It was emotional, as the adult granddaughter of the youngest of the seven siblings traces her family's history during World War II. Their parents lived in Berlin, Germany. After both were arrested and detained, a neighbor hid the children at his farm in the country for two years. Then they were transported to the United States by pretending to be orphans. Their surviving father eventually joined them in the US. Now almost 90 years old, the sisters speak on camera about their experiences as the granddaughter explores the places in Europe where they lived, hid, and fled from the Nazis. It's astounding that this whole group managed to escape and stay together.",True
5,n/a,met them at my job,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI had the pleasure of meeting beth and her mom tonight when they dined in at my job! They told me about their film and i was so intrigued that i couldn't wait to watch it. I literally turned it on the second i got home and me and my dad watched it together. It is a riveting story. The courage and reliance of the family is remarkable! I recommend watching! It was so amazing to see their names in the book showing their baptisms and finding the mom's name was indeed veronika. It's just such an amazing movie. My dad and i were just in awe. It was amazing to see their story unfold and to have their story be told!,True
6,10,Incredible storytelling- a must watch,karensmchugh,n/a,16/08/2025,The story of the Weber family is quite incredible and will show you about determination and grit of these young children surviving in a war torn Germany. Wonderfully told by the daughter of one of the 7. Beth was able capture interviews with her aunts as well as go on a journey in Germany to see and speak to folks about the locations and other findings which I will leave out of my review as to to ruin her storytelling. It is a must watch story and an important one for us all to see.I had the pleasure of watching this on the big screen and had Beth Lane as a guest speaker after the documentary was concluded.,False
7,10,"Fresh, true and full of appreciation and love",find-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am very moved and overwhelmed by watching UnBroken by Beth Lane. Firstly, there is the story itself, a true wonder.And then, of course, the way she designed the movie. I particularly like the fact that Beth never stops giving the viewers pictures all the time. I mean that the cartoons are interestingly taken just as seriously as the conversations of her family, the historical witnesses and the reality of her visits to Germany. This makes UnBroken extremely exciting at every moment. And the film editing is also excellent. This is my immediate answer after watching UnBroken - fresh, true and full of appreciation and love. A 100% recommendation!",False
8,10,One family's vitality and resilience despite the odds,robin-axelrod,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beth Lane's Unbroken is a powerful and deeply moving tribute to her mother and to the unyielding strength of her family. Far more than a tale of survival, the film is a testament to love, courage, and the enduring bonds that sustain us through history's darkest chapters. With grace and emotional depth, Beth Lane weaves a narrative that honors her family's unwavering commitment to one another and their determination to embrace life fully, even in the face of incredible adversity. Beautifully crafted and profoundly human, Unbroken speaks to audiences of all ages, offering inspiration and connection across generations.",False

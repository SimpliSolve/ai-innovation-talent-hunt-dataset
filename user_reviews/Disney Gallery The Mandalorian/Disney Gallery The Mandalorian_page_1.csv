1,9,Great and new look on the Star Wars Universe,IanHutcheson,n/a,16/08/2025,"In this series of documentaries about the mandalorian it isn't only about the mandalarian, it is about the whole story behind star wars and the purpose of star wars. The 2nd episode blew me away, Dave Filoni talks about the connection of the prequels to the original trilogy and the ark of Anakin skywalker. This is a must-see for Star Wars fans.",False
2,9,This is the future of star wars,cockerilldominic,n/a,16/08/2025,"It makes me happy to see the love they have for Star Wars they are relatable and they are the reason this series work.
In my opinion the future of Star Wars should be in these people's hands the fans who love the show and know what they are doing.",False
3,9,Awesome Stories and Storytellers!,drcombs,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a super exciting way to introduce us to how the Mandalorian was put together. It's clear by watching the series that they but a lot of time into every single detail, whether that was costumes, production design, visual effects, sound editing and mixing, and so much more. There is a lot of joy in watching this series and getting to hear about a shared love of Star Wars from all these wonderful filmmakers.",False
4,10,I 100% recommend this,brandonrhewitt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this makes me respect the cast and crew so much with what they do behind the scenes just to make an amazing show like this like its so good to see all these creative mind and to hear there stories, its just so beautiful and people should watch this its so inspiring aswell it really captivates you when listening to the great minds behind the show its amazing.",False
5,10,Legacy,chillsesion,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everything about this documentary is perfectly made. But i'd like to praise about last part of Chapter 2:Legacy when Dave Filoni explains about Qui-Gon and Anakin and what's the purpose of Star Wars to exist. And why is he doing this. Is not about lasers, starships, lightsabers battles and all that stuff. The original idea as conceived by George is family, to give hope, to kids specially and to see how deeply Filoni is connected and understand that legacy and how truthful he is to George's vision is what had made this and all his (Filoni) star wars productions so successful.",False
6,9,This is the Way... to take you behind the scenes!,G33KEd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Season 2 of 'The Mandalorian' is coming this October. But in the meantime, since today is Star Wars Day, we're taking you behind the scenes of one of the best shows of 2019 in this newest docuseries on Disney+!The show is about how they made this fan-favorite show, such as the crew, including the show's creator Jon Favreau, episode directors Dave Filoni, Taika Waititi (who is also in the cast), Rick Famuyiwa, Deborah Chow, and Bryce Dallas Howard, the cast, such as Pedro Pascal, Carl Weathers, Gina Carano, Giancarlo Esposito, Emily Swallow, and more, including interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and round table conversations.This is one great docuseries to see for Star Wars fans!",False
7,9,Mustt watch,granthales,n/a,16/08/2025,Get a feel for the durectir and producer team. If you like the show this is worth a watch.Thank God without Kennedy. Like the wick witch of the west she does appear here and there for a selfie of sorts.,False
8,10,The best in-depth look at Mandalorian,santatony-29066,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watch this and love this series more than the show it's documenting. It's so refreshing to get a full back stage tour of the characters, technology, directors, concepts and more. It's a treat to get to meet the many directors and see all the different strengths they bring to the show. I really hope the series continues as well as this documentary.",False
9,10,Wonderful talk series with the crew,UniqueParticle,n/a,16/08/2025,A lot of very interesting things to learn and definitely makes you respect the people that worked hard to make everything! I very much enjoy docu-series or movies where the crew talk about all the aspects around it. I highly recommend this for anyone! The bits with music is so peaceful too.,False
10,7,Filmmakers perspective on bringing star wars to life.,cruise01,n/a,16/08/2025,(3.5 out of 5 stars)A lot of fun to see the directors and there hard work on bringing each episode to life. A lot of fun if you care about behind the scenes. I did feel like this documentary ran a little too long.,False
11,10,The passion for cinematography described in detail!,jkrugly,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just love these episodes covering so many different aspects of the movie business. I am not a director professionally, but at heart I am. I totally connect with what is being discussed from direction, acting, music etc. All my respect to all you wonderful people behind the production of the Mandolorian - and for capturing the thought process behind the scenes. It is totally awesome!",False
12,7,Fantastic Behind the Scenes View.,FKDZ,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whilst the show does linger on praising itself a bit too much, and negating any critique or negativity towards aspects of the show it still delivers a proper behind the scenes look at the incredible work.There's some really good bits here and there, and the behind the scenes footage is the stuff you will be constantly hunting for, just waiting for it to show again. The Volume segment is stunning, the tech and the way it looks still blows my mind.Season 2 drops the round table setting and imo that was fine, it's a lot more of a traditional behind the scenes extra than season 1 which at times felt more like a director's commentary.Both seasons where easy to watch and enjoyable, well edited and the stuff you wanna see is there. Recommended!",False
13,2,Lost its way,vacavilleca,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Mandalorian theme tune is great. The series started out fun and went down hill from there. I had difficulty staying awake throughout the last two episodes of series 3. The writing sucked. Barbarella and the B/W Flash Gordon were better campy than the Mandalorian series. Kill future episodes. I believe in suspension of disbelief. The series was so bad I couldn't even do this easily in order to stay engaged. Am I not taking the right drugs? Or are others taking better ones?Trying to liven up my engagement with the series, I renamed Grogu, Wagyu. And I named the red headed female Mandalorian Margaret. She was so unbelievable. So many of the other characters were also unengageable.If, and I hope the series doesn't return, the there is a 4th series, the writers should go into total campy mode. Then at least we can enjoy the humor. And the production cost would be less. Go back to the 1950s to get inspiration. And hire the writers of the reboot of the 70's show to handle future Mandalorian scripts.",False
14,8,Interesting look into the Mandalorian,jwwalrath-227-85487,n/a,16/08/2025,"Disney Gallery: Star Wars: The Mandalorian is sort of a group of DVD featurettes transformed into series form as it takes an in-depth look at the behind-the-scenes process behind and creation of the show The Mandalorian. This was interesting.Givien that this was a highly expensive and ambitious show, going for a movie-like quality, you learn about the tremendous amount of effort given to make this all come together, including one really innovative technique.Be prepared that there isn't as much behind-the-scenes footage in this as you'd think. A lot of this is the showrunners, producers, directors, writers, actors, etc. sitting at a table and talking about the show. I felt this would slow things down, but the roundtable discussion format runs pretty smoothly. Everyone involved shows passion for what they did. And don't get me wrong, there is some interesting behind-the-scenes footage. It's more prevalent in the later episodes when the focus is more on the look and sound of Star Wars.Showrunners Jon Favreau (director of such films as Elf, Jungle Book, and Iron Man) and Dave Filoni (known for his work on the Star Wars animated shows) sort of run the narration and discussion and provide an infectious love for the world of Star Wars. Expect to be surprised by a couple of big name directors on this.Overall, if you're not a big on behind-the-scenes stuff, this isn't going to change your mind. Still, I think fans of The Mandalorian or Star Wars in general may appreciate this.",False
15,9,A Must Watch If You Have Seen The Mandalorian!,MovieBuff11732,n/a,16/08/2025,"Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian is a documentary series about The Mandalorian.Mandalorian is one of my favorite shows out there. I was extremely excited to see this show because I was curious about the technology that they used to make this series. So you know that was what I was looking for with this series. I was a little interested on how they operated baby throughout the show too. This show explained all of the that plus more things I found interesting.The score for The Mandalorian was one of the things that I loved about the show. I was really excited to see that they had an episode all about the score. It was really fascinating to see the way Ludwig Goransson crafted the beautiful score in this film.The last episode was also really fascinating because it focused on the connections to the previous Star Wars canon. There was also a funny clip with Jon Favreau and George Lucas about the gun the Mandalorian was using.The two episodes on props and technology might have been the best ones. It was extremely interesting to know how they did the IG unite in the series and many of the other creatures or robots that they used in the film. The way they filmed the things that looked like they were on location was extraordinary. I bet we will be seeming many more Disney films and TV shows start to do this.The first three episodes I must say weren't the best. You always here about the directors and cast now so it didn't really feel like anything new. There was also a whole episode on the legacy of Star Wars. It was cool to hear Dave Filoni's point of view on Star Wars but besides that, the episode just dragged.Overall, Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian was a fun show about the series I would recommend for the people who have seen the original show.",False
16,10,Great show even if you've never seen a starwars,isminimccaig,n/a,16/08/2025,I love that you can watch this even if you've never seen a Star Wars great story great effect great costume race set altogether great movie!!!,False
17,n/a,Beating a dead horse,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SW has become an over saturated, bereft of original thought dumpster fire. Off to the glue factory for a once decent product",False
18,10,Excellent show,rosemarysac-62356,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love this Series. Characters and storylines are always entertaining and leave me wanting to watch the next one immediately!
👏👏👏👏👏",False
19,10,Disney Gallery: Star Wars: The Mandalorian,kaden_lewis,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was so cool to watch. It gives you an incredibly deep dive into almost all the stuff that happened behind the scenes of The Mandalorian. Some of the still they showed was so cool, I would never have believed they did it without watching this. It also gives you a deeper appreciation of The Mandalorian because you see hidden meanings of things, or things they were trying to imply. You also see the effort and dedication the crew put into this snow. It 100% paid off. This is broken up into two seasons. The first one was obviously for the behind the scenes of season 1, and the second the behind the scenes for season 2. However they were both different. Season one had 8 episodes where Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni sat at a circle table with whoever they were talking to and dedicated an entire episode to that. Season two was more straight to the point. It had 2 episodes. The first being the behind the scenes for season 2, and the second being the making of the season 2 finale. I liked the change because I feel 8 episodes was a little too much for a behind the scenes special, and it was nice to get something new.For all you people who watched The Mandalorian, I definitely recommend watching this. It was very cool to see the behind the scenes, and it made my appreciation for The Mandalorian so much greater. This was a very well done behind the scenes special.",False
20,7,Documentary about the making of the TV series The Mandalorian,Zeyders,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary series about the creation of the series The Mandalorian in the universe of Star Wars, will be very interesting to people who want to see what is happening behind the scenes. In which will raise different topics and in a clear form of storytelling.The first season, as I guess, was meant to capture all aspects and principles of the Mandalorian's creation and not have a continuation in the form of subsequent seasons of one or two episodes each. The following seasons feel more like an emotional chronicle over the work process. Regardless, and particularly the first season, were highly entertaining and in some ways interesting.Watch for those who are interested in the behind-the-scenes without the suspense - you can, but you won't get anything supernatural.",False
21,6,Credit where credit is due?,heathergirdlestone,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love to watch behind the scenes, especially with the directorial genius that was involved in the making of this incredible, groundbreaking series. The first mainstream tv series to be made for Star Wars and we are privileged get to see inside it.One sequence of shots really bothered me though when watching this. They parallel edited archive footage from the first film, shots my grandfather shot and lit. They picked apart so many of these original shots in detail, around the directors table and the individual directors Taika Waititi (whose incredible) discussed my grandfathers work and attention to detail, and then they even showed a photograph of Lucas behind his camera.Was Gilbert Taylor mentioned once? In an episode talking about the importance of not deviating to far from the original shots, and the importance of the old artwork influencing the new.They even mentioned the Dam Busters as an influence for certain shots and put Lucas's name solely to that. I feel that to have whole episodes discussing the original shots being such an influence on the new ones, and to rightfully mention the names of the people who made the models, but to not mention his name makes me feel that they chose to intentionally leave out my grandfather's name?They even discussed keeping shots as clear as possible for the CGI, because there are just some shots just that can't be sorted in post. His notes are all over this, and all it takes is a small mention to put credit where it was due. I acknowledge that there is a lot of people whose names haven't been mentioned, but to edit it in this way, to make it look like it was all his work and no one else's left a little bit of a bad taste, whether intentional or not. I have a lot of respect for George Lucas and everything that he has created, and I know he didn't edit this, but if I had filmed them and watched this I would feel incredibly shortchanged.Just sayin...",False

23,1,A self indulging making of about a destroyed legacy.,jimmycoffin-751-212853,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThey talk about practical effects and realism all the time but most of the whole season2 looks cheap CGI and terrible action sequences where CGI droids and every scene with the jetpack looks so fake and unrealistic.My fav episode of mandalorian was with the sprider cave. A favorite because it could have been so much better If they used stop motion or animatronics at the closeups. Instead everything Is just CGI. It looks to modern and fake, still, it was the only good episode of season 2, while the rest was a total uninteresting mess of CGI. Its do funny when the directors clap their backs and pretending they make worlds that feels real when they actually failed at conveying any sort impact In the action scenes as they did with the old starwars. Its never finns be the same no matter how much praise mandalorian recieved. Its still a janky, CGI filled mess. Not even the emperial walker felt menacing.Then we have these filler episodes with incredible bad acting and everything Is just ridiculus when there's hundreds of stormtroopers and none of them manage to hit the heroes!? Realistic? Not much.",True

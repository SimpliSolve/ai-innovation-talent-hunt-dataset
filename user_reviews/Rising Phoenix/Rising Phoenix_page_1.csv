2,8,Rising Phoenix is Must See,magmigda,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beautifully told stories of many Paralympic competitors, as well as the story of how parasports began and the struggle the Games have faced over the years to exist. Informative, inspiring, heart wrenching!",False

5,10,Best documentary ever,michaeleejiang,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky to work for Paralympic movements for 6 six years. Those were the best 6 six years. I met a lot of best athletes and people on this planet. This documentary brings back a lot of good memories, and re-inspired me to be a stronger and better person.",False
6,10,Exciting,virginialeigh,n/a,16/08/2025,I am not usually one for documentaries but this one was riveting and had me sitting on the edge of my seat. Although I was surprised to find myself in tears at certain times and laughing at other times. This has forever changed my mind about the Paralympics and something that I would like to attend in the future.,False
7,10,Real Super Heroes,ashleyhonorablenet,n/a,16/08/2025,"THIS Docu was extremely engaging. Loved the weaving in of historical context throughout with old footage testifying and linking the STILL forbidden controversial discourse that our modern society refuse to have, in addressing children and adults with disabilities. With a needed dose of humility for everyone, This Docu awakens the humanity in all of us, reminding everyone that none of us is perfect and we are all Superheroes. It reminds me of the Scripture in Corinthians which implores you to remember that each and every one of us was born with a UNIQUE Gift from The Almighty, and we should NOT focus on what is impossible, but lean towards that Gift from God and you will be exceptional. Never let what you are unable to do, Overshadow what you Can Do. This Docu reminds me of the Power in ME, The Power I DO Have!!! Engaging, Uplifting and Superbly Inspirational!! Support the Paralympicsüëçüëç",False
8,7,Inspiring!,MaverickV,n/a,16/08/2025,"Surely it is great, inspirational, and gives you goosebumps. The directors did a commendable job though it would have been amazing if they would have portrayed the stories of more 'not so known' Paralympic Warriors (I choose not to call them just Heroes). And more deeper day-2-day trials and tribulations they face and then how they overcome to reach to the point they are in, surely with the people in their lives who supported them all the way...Because my fellow humans it is NOT just about winning, success or showcasing to others - it is about conquering your own insecurities and fears and transcending them. It is about living that life of a true Warrior!But do give this a chance and you (who is in any stage or situation in your life) will be Inspired!",False
9,10,A Story Untold,kbaugh-87126,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a really interesting film set more as a group of stories than a standard documentary. It is equal parts uplifting and engaging. The important thing here is it shines a light on incredible athletes and people who are often hidden behind able-bodies counterparts.What I found most engaging was that with each person featured, the audience got to know their story and a little about their past and journey to the Paralympics. I can agree it can feel a bit rushed, but that's only because each person's story and journey had enough meat to be its own movie. But, it seems like Parasport champions don't get these kind of fictional power stories like other athletes such as Michael Jordan, Michael Bennett, IU basketball, the 1980 US Hockey team, a horse named Seabiscuit, the Oakland As, you get the idea. These are all inspiring stories, and every on of the athletes who participate in the Paralympics can equal them.I don't agree with The NY Times narrow view of the documentary lambasting it for showing athletes at the top of their game and that using the idea that this is some sort of advertisement as a negative. Of course it is! In the best way. The Paralympics do not receive widespread attention it deserves. Look what almost happened in Rio. If watching this documentary is an inducement for someone, who would otherwise be unaware of the amazing athletes or the sports, to take interest and start following, well that's sort of the point. And this film showcases it well. Documentaries are made to bring attention to the subject matter to shine the light in a positive or eye opening way or provide commentary on the subject matter.I rated this a 10 because I really want to encourage people to see this documentary because the content is fantastic. If this was getting more attention I'd realistically rate it an 8 from a pure technical film standpoint. Some of the cuts and editing choices could have been done a bit better. It did have that feeling that they needed to get everything in this one film because it was their only chance. This easily could have been set as a short docu-series with each episode focusing on an individual athlete and overlaying the history and recent olympics. However, the content, as mentioned, was fantastic.",False
10,6,A celebration of human potential,urbanswami,n/a,16/08/2025,"The history and current standing of the Paralympic Games, which has grown to become the world's third largest sporting event, despite major setbacks and the unlikeliness of the mere existence of the games to begin with -is what the plot summary should say.
The featured athletes' personal stories are inspirational sure, but I'd argue that the film's most potent message lies in the story of the founder of the Games; the man who saw and helped others to see the value of human life, the grace and beauty of the human form and it's motion, thus starting a movement that would not only challenge presumptions about disability, but also rekindle appreciation for humanity.",False
11,10,Most inspiring Documentary of the year.,matthias_benner-62769,n/a,16/08/2025,"Honestly? Just watch it, look at these inspiring people, their strength and unbreakable believe in their own and societies abilities. 100% Oscar worthy.",False
12,10,Wow!,kristi2374,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was SOOOOO good! I have not noticed it on my Netflix home page. In fact, I had to do a name search to find it on Netflix. I actually noticed it on the ""More Like This"" section on IMDB after rating My Octopus Teacher. Wow! I am so glad that it was there! I haven't ever watched the Paralympic Games, but I am just as excited to see them next year. I am actually more excited to see them than the Olympic Games. This documentary was so touching. I absolutely loved it!",False
13,10,Extraordinary!,bnoel-72310,n/a,16/08/2025,So well done! Everyone connected to this film should be proud. It's sooooo inspiring & uplifting plus although I've watched the Paralympics I learned something new about its history.,False
14,10,Empowering,jackiee1970,n/a,16/08/2025,I found myself captivated by this film. Very well put together documentary!The strength and determination of the athletes was inspiring.It was great also to really be informed of the history behind the Games which I never really knew. I found myself tearing up a number of times at the emotion and effort so many put into their sport and the behind the scenes of the Games.Definitely worth watching!,False
15,10,Astounding and deeply inspiring,tilokaudaman,n/a,16/08/2025,It is difficult to for me to discribe how moved I was by this beautiful film. It made me examine my own attitudes about people with diaibilities and renewed my belief in the power of the human spirit.,False
16,10,Immensely powerful message,stefanrofl,n/a,16/08/2025,One of the most powerful docs I have ever seen. Thank you to all the incredible super-humans for sharing your stories and spreading the message that you can overcome any unimaginable obstacle laid before you. This made a grown man truly cry his eyes out. Much gratitude from Norway.,False
17,9,Never give up,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"As far as inspirational documentaries go, this is up there with any other of them. Personal stories of success, but mostly overcoming expectations and defying what others may think of oneself. So while not every story leads to victory (in the form of medals or other merits in physical form), it is a victory in spirit form. In the form of not just surviving, but accomplishing something.Very well edited and for anyone who is looking to brighten their day, to see what the human will and determination is able to achieve. So we don't feel sorry but give them confidence and show them, that being born with a handicap, does not mean, your life is over. This really is powerful and a testament of what is best in the human race ... Arnold Schwarzenegger has said in the past, how humbled he is by what others have managed to do and overcome. And how great these people are compared to others, who may try to put them down in one way or the other. We are in this together! Lift others up, literally or metaphorically speaking ...",False
18,10,Best documentary I have ever seen,srgymrat33,n/a,16/08/2025,"Honestly this is incredibly good . It's well done , flows great , keeps you interested , educates and inspires . I loved the people they decided to interview , each with their own story . So many powerful events and powerful people .I am a huge sports fan , and obsessed with the Olympics so the content matter was an obvious plus . I loved how it portrayed para Olympics as real sports and the athletes as real athletes ( which they are ) but I think this will help people who feel different view them this way . I smiled and cried start to finish , and I left wanting to do better and be better and make the best of any situation .I started it at 11pm thinking I would watch half and finish it tomorrow , powered through it and now I am writing this review and texting every other true sports fan I know telling them to watch this immediately . Watch it - you won't regret it .",False
19,10,Inspirational!,kate-34291,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a complete delight. This documentary was both heartfelt and utterly compelling. I cried, I laughed and I learn't a lot. At times it even felt like a thriller and I was on the edge of my seat holding my breath praying things would work out. The individuals were breathtaking in their courage, their passion for their sport and for life itself. I won't give any spoilers but I will say this was one of the most memorable documentaries I've had the good fortune to watch. It changed me. It gave me an insight into and an understanding of a world I had previously been ignorant of. Who knew!? ... I really want to go to the next Paralympics.",False
20,10,Amazing Athletes,clintcarter-28550,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's great to see these amazing athletes, and the people who started and continue to run the Paralympics, get the attention they deserve. I hope everyone remembers to watch Tokyo 2021 and Beijing 2022!",False
21,9,"The Olympics are where athletes become heroes, The Paralympics are where heros go to compete",mag_dalena,n/a,16/08/2025,Completely inspiring and engaging look into the physical and mental strength behind Paralympic athletes.

24,10,Utterly Amazing and inspiring human beings,patriktaylor-18899,n/a,16/08/2025,A very fresh breath of air and insight into the world of Paralympics. It would be a crime to say anything bad about this documentary. Bravo to all involved.,False
25,10,Spectacular documentary!,ElanaSz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have seen this documentary twice now and recommend it to all of my friends to watch. It is a spatular story about real badass awesome superheroes. Learning about how the Paralympics was created was very informative; I will be in the stands next time for sure. The main interviewee's stories are powerful, inspiring, and I have the utmost respect for them. The cinematography was EPIC. Such a well-shot film. They had great locations. One of my favorite shots is when Bebe Vio is practicing in this old European mansion in slow motion, and they have camera angles from above and from the side in slow motion. They pace the lyrical editing with classical music. She was like a warrior dancing. Truly spectacular! Well done, everyone who worked on this movie!",False

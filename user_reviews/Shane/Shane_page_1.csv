1,7,"Reminds me how great and unique Warne was, could have done with deeper insight",wisdomwasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary is well put together. Shane Warne is one of the great characters in sport and the greatest cricketer of my time. This documentary serves to remind me there was nothing like him, the way he spun the ball, got into batsman's heads and got in the news was unlike anyone.It was definitely a positive view of Warne however to its detriment. There was a roll call of Shane's friends, however some, like Chris Martin and Ed Sheeran were wasted, instead of giving an insight into the effects of fame they talked about him as a cricket fan.It would have also been great to hear from some people who weren't as positive towards him. Steve Waugh on managing him as a captain, dropping him in West Indies and their relationship even from someone from South Africa like a Graeme Smith on what Warne was like as an opposition player, especially when he crossed the line.However it was good to get a greater insight into his family life, and his success in the IPL. Warne was truly one of a kind, and the good and the not always good made him who he was.",False
2,7,"Interesting despite the many meaningless, superficial interviews",grantss,n/a,15/08/2025,"A documentary on the life and feats of Shane Warne, arguably cricket's greatest ever spin bowler.A fairly interesting documentary. It covers well Warne's history from pre-cricket days to fame and then to retirement from the game. We get a sense of what drives him and made him great as well as the sacrifices he had to make. One of these sacrifices is on the family side and we get to see how his career affected his wife and children.The interviews with Warne himself aren't bad and give a decent insight into his mentality and passion.Far from brilliant though. While many of the interviewees are relevant and insightful, e.g. Allan Border, Mark Taylor, Ian Botham, Merv Hughes, many of the interviews are just people (some of whom are great cricketers in their own right) saying how great he is without contributing anything substantial. It gets a bit one-dimensional after a while.The worst offenders are the interviewees who have nothing to do with cricket - Chris Martin (of Coldplay, not the New Zealand cricketer), Ray Martin and, worst of all, Ed Sheeran. Heaven knows why they were interviewed. If I want to hear someone banging on about how great Shane Warne is, they should at least be someone who has played cricket at the highest level themselves.",False
3,7,One of the best of all time,bbctsxkwk,n/a,15/08/2025,"Good documentary, some parts are not really required, I watched this just after his passing away. What a cricketer, I grew up watching him destroy teams with that lethal spin. RIP Shane.",False
4,7,For cricket fans,happyismoho,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a passionate England cricket fan I hated Shane Warne, I hated him for his typical Aussie arrogance, his stupid hair and ear rings but mostly I hated him for terrorising our batsman and consequently me as a fan. In equal measure I couldn't help but be in awe of the guy, his charisma, his ability to turn a game on it's head, he was simply the greatest bowler I'd ever seen and I found this documentary really interesting.I still hate him though...",False
5,n/a,Great documentary,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great documentary but a massive shame it was spilt by very poor choices of people to speak on his behalf. Kevin Petersen was completely self indulgent, Chris Martin and Ed Sheeran didn't have a clue about cricket. Took away from the real magic that Warne was. Makes you wonder why a lot of legendary cricketers weren't part of the documentary - Ponting for example. Afraid the smoke behind the betting controversy may be a big reason.",False
6,8,"It's not luck, it's attitude",adamjames78,n/a,15/08/2025,"While this might skip over the 'not so nice' bits about Warne, you can't help get caught up the greatness of Shane Warne. I was privileged to grow up watching him and McGrath do their thing and this doco really does capture the essence of that era. Shane Warne was the most entertaining cricketer I have ever seen. A great trip down memory lane and a cricket tragic's dream.",False
7,7,"""Bowled, Warney!""",Lejink,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's so sad that very soon after this documentary was released, Shane Warne, the Australian leg-spinning cricketing legend, should pass away at the age of only 52. But it seems to be the fate of a select number of hell-raising, glamorous, big personality sport stars to be taken far too young and Warne, like motor-racing champion James Hunt and golfing superstar Seve Ballesteros before him, wouldn't ever enter old age. I still remember the shock of hearing the news of his death, all the more poignant as Warne had earlier that day only just communicated his own commiserations to the family on the death that morning of another Australian cricketing great, wicket-keeper Rodney Marsh, before he too passed.This documentary attempts to condense the great man's turbulent personal and sporting life into a 90+ minute documentary so of course it can only give a flavour of him, but it seems clear that while he was a flawed individual, being sometimes self-confessedly guilty of naivety, selfishness and pig-headedness, he nevertheless comes across as a good bloke, as well as being a helluva cricketer, who connected equally with celebrities (Coldplay's Chris Martin and Ed Sheeran pay tribute here and I recall eulogies on his death from fellow-fans Mick Jagger and Elton John) and the man and woman in the street.With the active participation of his family, including contributions from his ex-wife, three children, parents and younger brother, we get the back story of his youthful development, learning that his first chosen sport was actually Aussie Rules Football, but when this career stalled, he turned to cricket, encouraged in this by his once-disgraced fellow-countryman Test bowler Terry Jenner, where he found he could master the almost obsolete technique of leg-spin bowling, considered the most difficult bowling style of all to perfect.After a slow start on two Asian tours, his Test career kicked off firstly in Sri Lanka and went stratospheric with the ""Ball Of The Century, which was his first ball bowled in his first Ashes Test in England and which spectacularly cleaned up Mike Gatting. Then even as he started racking up the first of his over seven hundred victims, there were the almost inevitable cricketing run-ins he had later in his career with the powers-that-be, involving firstly allegations of match-fixing in Pakistan where he was cleared, then the pitch-report scandal in India involving him and Mark Waugh which he got over and then finally of taking an illegal substance where he was found guilty and suspended from playing for a year.He talks of his failed marriage but appears to have stayed on good terms with his ex-wife and three now-adult children. Family, friends and fellow cricketers (the latter including Alan Border, Sachin Tendular and Ian Botham but naturally not Steve Waugh!) all speak well of him as a great player, competitor and great company, although I might also to have expected to hear from the likes of Liz Hurley, Glenn McGrath and Brian Lara to name but three who also played major parts in his personal and sporting lives.Like I said, I might have wished for this film to be longer and show a little more of his cricketing exploits but I got enough from it to make my own judgement about the man behind the myth.R. I. P. Shane, a one-of-a-kind cricketer and thoroughly likeable guy, who died in an untimely fashion, just as he seemed to be at peace with himself.",False
8,10,Remember when sport was fun?,matthewgeoffreydale,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lots of things I didn't know about Warnie and, along with other great characters from his era (Swervin' Merve, Chapelli, AB etc), reminds me why I used to love watching cricket! A celebration of a possibly slightly flawed man and brilliant athlete who has given millions of people many hours of joy!",False
9,8,A great insight how he developed,kimhopkins-05853,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Shane"" I thought was a good documentary for all cricket lovers who wanted to know more about Shane Warne's life. Was released 7 weeks prior to Warnies shock passing in Koh Samui March. I can recommend this dvd to all cricket fans. He was not only a wonderful person who gave his all but also a very good father who loved his kids more than anything.RIP Warnie.",False
10,8,Bowled Shane,kellyandstephenbrown,n/a,15/08/2025,Grew up watching Warne McGrath and company dominate cricket. Learnt so much about Shane Warne after watching this. After Cricket career ended certainly came across as smug and arrogant..guess after being one of the best Sports people in the world for 20 years he deserves this attitude.,False
11,5,It was Ok,bronx777,n/a,15/08/2025,I'm guessing Shane had a lot of input into this doco as it skims over the trials of his career and speaks to his tribulations in great length. Some strange choices of character references (Ray Martin?) but otherwise a pretty good insight into the rise and rise of one Shane Keith Warne.,False
12,8,Hits different now,ayushparasar,n/a,15/08/2025,I was emotionally invested from the first minute of it knowing that he passed although I had a feeling I already know most of the stories that will be shown here.That doesn't change the fact that every cricket lover will absolutely love this hour and a half of Shane Warne's cricketing highlights and also giving some sense to what and who the person is or rather was.,False
13,10,Excellent biography documentary sports film,wedfan-52803,n/a,15/08/2025,I watched Shane documentary on Amazon prime today I found the documentary interesting about Shane warne highs and lows for the Australia cricket team I like the scene were Shane warne was banned for the 2003 cricket odi World Cup for taking drugs and he was banned for whole year that scene in the documentary well dramatic and I liked the clips were Shane warne gets his final wicket for Aussie cricket team in the 2006 ashes against England when he bowled out Andrew Strauss that scene was heartwarming and it had excellent interviews from beefy and kp and Andrew Strauss and the little master it was a good film.,False
14,4,Niche,papafuzzypeg,n/a,15/08/2025,"Unquestionably a great cricket hero, but somewhat an indulgent documentary, suited more for cricket fans, and excessive in duration. More appropriate as a programme to show when it's raining during a cricket broadcast.",False
15,1,I thought this was a cricket documentary,tdurkin-22382,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a long-time cricket fan and big admirer of Warne, who was at Old Trafford on that ball of the century day and whose death really shocked and saddened me, I was really looking forward to watching this.But the first face I saw on it was Chris Martin, followed shortly after by Ed Sheeran, so I gave up. Surely there are enough eminent cricket colleagues to talk about the great man without resorting to pop stars as talking heads.",False
16,5,Should of been better,mark-farrow-audiopost,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOk content , but it needed some more cinematic treatment to make it film . It's like watching a news feature rather than a film .What's going with Ian chappels hair .",True

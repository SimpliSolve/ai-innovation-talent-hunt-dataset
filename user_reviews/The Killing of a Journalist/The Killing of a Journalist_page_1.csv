1,10,Excellent portrayal of a Corrupt Government,naq-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story behind this documentary is rather complex, and to do a summary will never be enough to explain all the ramifications of the story--it is the tip of the iceberg in terms of government corruption, where every major public official is in some way connected with the death of one of the only journalists who dared to expose them.The Journalist, a young man named Jan, and his girlfriend, Martina, are found dead of gunshots point blank in their simple home. The police chief begins by saying that there will be a full investigation, but every other journalist in the room knows that something very fishy is going on here.Bit by bit, the story unfolds, and by the time we find out who actually committed the murder, it is a little more than one-third into the film, thus comprising the first act. However, the second act is much more complex, because the other journalists jump into action, finding out more and more details of what happened behind the scenes to cause this killing to be ordered, by whom and for what.The details are very complex, and as such, it is a bit confusing to sort out everything that takes place after the culprit is arrested --in particular, one needs a scorecard to keep track of every player in the game -- but that is essentially where the story really begins, since it is an indictment of the entire Serbian government, the senior members of the police and practically every one of the members of the controlling elite.The story also incorporates the trial of all who were responsible for the killing, delving into the incredibly corrupted system that has maintained control over the entire population--and even extends to the Justice system. It is mind-boggling how far up the chain it goes. Not a single member of the Serbian elected and appointed officials is exempt from the conspiracy.The third act incorporates the trial of the main antagonists involved in this organization, and the only name that can be given them is a Mafia. These people make the Italian Mafia look like a bunch of kindergarten bullies by comparison -- much much more sophisticated and much much more vicious.The one shortcoming of the film is that the filmmakers know the players so well that they somehow ignore the fact that we cannot keep all the various names sorted out in our heads, and so the entire project suffers from a lack of a Narration to keep up with what is happening and who is accused of what.The main lesson that we can come away with from the experience is that we, in this country, are not exempt from the same thing happening here.",False

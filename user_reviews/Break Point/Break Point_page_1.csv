1,10,Literally cried in last scene,surajkumardev,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not a movie
This is not a web series
This is the 'Journey' of Mahesh and Paes.No words only Respect.I wish I could meet with them .. Just to Say 'Thank you so much Mahesh and Paes'. You guys made India Proud.",False
2,10,One person can be singled out for what happened,karagir,n/a,16/08/2025,"Its an incredible story of two incredibly talented tennis players. In spite of the unfortunate happenings in their relationship as a doubles team, they still achieved things only a 'perfect' team could hope to achieve. So talented, they each were, individually! But together, they could only make us wonder about the possibilities had things not gone bad.Credit goes to Leander for coming up with a dream of partnering with an Indian.Credit goes to Mahesh that he decided to accept an offer a fellow Indian made( even though at that time he had not even made a mark for himself)
One can only wonder what then went wrong? Was it Rico?, Was the federation? Was it their parents? One can only guess.....
The support team(s) which included all those involved, bar no one, looked at the partnership as two separate individuals and not as one team.Too bad nobody had the guts to point a finger at Mr. Khanna for the Doha fiasco. Why did he not invite Mahesh to a preparatory camp, since he had retired 3 months back?Anyway, Lee and Hesh, you made us proud and it was so good while it lasted.I hope the same does not happen to Satwik Sai Ranki Reddy and Chirag Shetty, but then they have not yet scaled the same heights badminton as these two did in tennis.....at least not yet.",False
3,10,Break point!!,puranjanbasak,n/a,16/08/2025,Break point is a sports documentary on the lives of india's finest tennis duo leander paes and mahesh bhupathi!!I think it is one of the finest documentaries in india. The episodes hv been meticulously designed and u won't feel any boredom or unattachment. It is immersive and engaging. The theme music is wonderful. Towards the latter half u yourself would feel the same as the duo. The anger and frustration is real. Nitesh tiwari and ashwini iyer tiwari hv created it with care and sincerity. U should and cannot miss this depiction of the poster boys of indian tennis. Must watch!!,False
4,10,To the point Docu-series where even if u want to U can not pick sides,dhaval_333,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, I had tears too like most of us in last scene. Absolute honest and tells us everything we need to know about ""INDIAN EXPRESS""- Their ups and downs, their glory days their partnership, their passion, and chalupanthi and wrong noises around them.Loved it.",False
5,n/a,Break Point On Zee5 Review: An Engaging Postmortem of India's Biggest Sporting Tragedy,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was meant to be. Break Point, directed by film-maker couple Nitesh Tiwari and Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, is a throbbing marriage story. The seven-part documentary series charts the highs and lows of a famous relationship: the mid-90s coupling against all odds, the cross-cultural chemistry, the heady honeymoon phase, the rift, the lack of communication, the outsiders, the separation phase, and arguably India's most iconic divorce. At one point, both sets of parents even intervene to unite the two soulmates. It may sound like a gimmick, but the makers' own dynamic genuinely brings a sense of balance to an inherently imbalanced piece of history. Their own experience - of working and living together - aids the assembly of a complicated narrative about two people who struggled to distinguish between working and living together. The interviewing is sharp and detailed. There is clarity about the rhythm and editing, even when the material becomes repetitive. This merging of storytellers and story is no match made in heaven, but it's a compelling - and perhaps necessarily campy - portrait of platonic disintegration.Read the full review on Film Companion.",True
6,10,Mindblowing,tannukhan-44378,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are a 90 's guy than this is for u even if you are not a tennis fan it will blow your mind,I love tennis because of Paes and Bhupathi even at that time I can not watch their matches but in newspaper I used to read about them .This doc is a ride if emotions, love,ego,self respect and off course love for our country. We love you Lee-hesh ,you taught us to chase our dreams.",False
7,8,The story of Indian Express,sdadsasdasdasdasdasd,n/a,16/08/2025,"I should say that there's no better place to know about the ups and downs of the legendary Indian pair of tennis anywhere. The directors have done a very good job, there could have been voice over at some places so that the documentary feeling was more.All credits to the flag bearers of Indian Tennis. It's just the destiny that took over, that they didn't play together in the ATP circuit. But, they both have achieved enough, and it brings tear and the story grips you with emotions.",False
8,10,The greatest,nikree,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not jus the duo, but the documentary made is so brilliant. It is authentic and true, involving all the major characters and the narration from themselves esp. Mahesh and Leander.Even for a non-tennis fan, this is so enjoyable that you won't feel a second passing.Music is the perfect. Be it the theme or background music; it is so apt to convey emotions. At times, you're sad, cheerful, proud, confused and all others different flavours of emotions.Sports documentaries does the best to break the fame and reveal us as a vulnerable humans. And this documentary is spot on at that. You'll find out through their story, different fallacies of human behaviour and how we at times do stupid mistakes which is invisible to us.There's a great blend between sports and personal life of the characters. But primarily this is a personal journey of the characters through their sports life.A must watch, not jus for sports or tennis. But also cuz it's a great work which is worth watching in general. And also if you're a Indian, for the pride of the country.",False

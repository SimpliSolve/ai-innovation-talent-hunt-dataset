1,8,Artistic Inferno at the House of LaForge,do_phto,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA Life of Art is a nightmare-ish vignette uncovering palimpsestic allusions of the artistic and historical past of contemporary New York artist, Scooter LaForge. It is a decisive menage of personal and collective memories transcribing his long interrogation of the twentieth century's most recognisable cartoon characters. The film recalls with intensest vividness, his earliest electronic nanny programming, spliced with well observed commentary from outstanding American fashion forecasters, music legends, and avant-garde magic-makers.LaForge's paradigm may intertwine storytelling, aesthetics and an archeology of his own fruity past, but his imagery speaks not for the feint hearted. His collaboration in an expanded field with Ethan Minsker's gifted film editing and direction, combines usually censored materials and technologies to synthesise art's oldest theme: the celebration of life juxtaposed with the terror of mortality.Highlighting where thoughtful investigations of modern issues co-exist with puerile humour, sexual obscenity, and violence in comedy, the modus operandi of the film begets its stereophotogrammetry graphics. There are smeared animated glimpses of phantasmagorical squiggles that ejaculate colored stains into images of self-sucking masturbators which give the audience a volumetric type of dimensional felatio into LaForge's world. Acknowledging a debt to artists such as Bosch, Goya and The Chapman Bros, what ultimately takes root here is a prolific visionary's saucy canvas tales becoming embedded in our thoughts using theatrical fluidity of brushstroke, and a true riot of color. In paintings like 'Severed Hand', I see crimson ribbons menstrate roses from unhinged safety pins, hyperdermic needles perforating used condoms in all kinds of unusual places, while a white kitten urinates over a smiling fire-hydrant with all the deft fracture and psychological intensity of an apocalyptic feline firefighter. And that's not all folks!LaForge's oeuvre is full of metaphysical contradictions at once melding the squeegee scrape of Richter's post-photographic abstraction, with the corporeal deformity of a Bacon portrait. Certainly! Here is the sentence with corrected grammar:""In the spirit of Fluxus and Dada, there is an honesty in LaForge's postmodern appropriation of fashion symbols and anime, often drawing likenesses with the purpose of politicizing or ridiculing the subject. ''Talking Monsters' are like kinetic avatars, recycled from sidewalk matter, assembled and painted with equanimous societal values while watching fact and fiction anal intercourse.For me, A Life Of Art abbreviates the way LaForge dismantles but what it misses is what the artist withholds. I'm left longing to penetrate below the surface and decipher the ordinary of LaForge's life; where his legacy is at its most sexy. The artist's tenderness to surrender, as the studio lift elevates, is a very attractive point of arrival but it is here in the storyline the film needs to educate us more to grow.What I do love about the film and LaForge himself, is the comfort of knowing that all radical stimulus in art and life, comes without warning. I am reminded of the young poet Voung (2019) teaching, 'We make more of anything we find aesthetically pleasing...we reproduce it to keep it and extend it through space and time', which encapsulates poetically the serenity in LaForge's work.Don't scooter past scrolling without first groping a Bo-Peep at this man's first early biopic. It is only a matter of time before you'll catch art lovers above 14th St queueing overnight to purchase of a pair of custom-made Studio LaForgeous testicular spectacles for a 3D streaming version.",True
2,8,Super rad if you're into artsy stuff and activism.,oliviaphilip,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie about Scooter LaForge is super rad if you're into artsy stuff and activism. Scooter's, like, this cool New York dude who's totally grabbed the art world's attention with his wild creativity. The movie's okay, I guess. Scooter talks a lot and he's pretty interesting but there are too many people talking, and it's kinda overwhelming. I mean, it's cool to hear about his life, especially his struggles growing up, but sometimes it's like, too much. His art is influenced by, like, all over the U. S. and it's all about social issues, like AIDS, BLM and stuff, and he talks about it a lot. His art's like a time capsule, showing all these important events. Overall, it's a bit all over the place, but it's still kinda cool to learn about this edgy artist.",False
3,10,An art doc that is art,alanl-35503,n/a,16/08/2025,"A refreshingly stylized documentary on an incredible artist. Minsker injects his visual style and a ""wall of sound"" that drives the storytelling in a compelling and entertaining way. Many documentaries can rely too much on talking heads, but Minsker uses them in a balanced way along with interviews with LaForge and captures the artist as he rises in prominence in the New York art world.It doesn't linger long on LaForge's early days growing up or time in San Francisco, but gives you enough to understand where he came from.I was fortunate to see the documentary in an old opera house at the 7th annual Jim Thorpe Independent Film Festival in Pennsylvania.",False
4,10,Excellent Documentary,mrcthedj,n/a,16/08/2025,"From his early years as an odd man out to his drug fueled years in the swinging seventies and eighties, all the way up to the pivotal marches, Covid-19 and social upheaval of the polarizing 2020s; this doc covers Scooter LaForge's undeniable impact. A contemporary of the likes of Kieth Haring and Gail Thacker. His influence is timelessly infused within the fabric of LGBT culture during the highly romanticized days of old New York. He painted everything: Canvases, Sculptures, and even people! His artwork appears on a remarkably unique clothing line, worn by the socialites and punk rockers alike, including Debbie Harry. This is a great doc. It's the story of an artistic icon you might not realize you need to know.",False
5,9,A gem of a film!,craigahrens,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had no idea what to expect when selecting this wonderful gem of a film. The trailer captured my interest so I thought, why not. Boy am I glad I took a flyer on this film. This an area of art world I know very little about. That's what really captured my interest. I found myself wanting to learn about this and I wanted to learn about Scooter and his art. I quickly realized this was a whole thing. I mean a culture of its own. A culture very foreign yet intriguing to me. I thoroughly enjoyed the humanity of this film. The reflecting on Scooters career and how so many can relate to similar career struggles. I appreciated how writer/director Ethan H. Minsker presented this documentary. Meaning, it didn't drag. I didn't find my mind wondering off. It moved along at a very nice pace. I believe myself to be a hard critic and there were no flat spots in this terrific documentary for me. I soundly give this gem of a film two thumbs up!!",False
6,n/a,A Visually Stunning Glimpse into the New York City Downtown Art Scene,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Scooter La Forge, a Life of Art"" is a visually stunning glimpse into the New York City downtown art scene and the fascinating life of the popular neo expressionistic artist. The main attraction is director/producer/writer Ethan Minsker's use of visual effects and compelling animation. Minsker employs his own creative use of electrifying images, such as Scooter's mother talking about her son through a cardboard TV set, to enhance our understanding of the artist's journey, from his humble beginnings as a bullied gay youth, to San Francisco's 90's club scene, to becoming the darling of the New York art world.Intertwined are interviews with Patricia Field and Michael Musto. Scooter offers valuable advice to young artists, mostly by teaching them to be adaptable with their environment. Scooter paints his message of love on just about anything - using found objects such as clothing, sculpture and murals. The main thrust of this movie is love. This movie is a work of art itself.",False
7,10,A must-see.,lmedle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Never have I seen an art documentary so immediately arresting and disarming than Ethan Minsker's new masterpiece ""Scooter LaForge: A Life of Art"".The film begins with a few frames of what look like humble handheld footage shot in Manhattan's Lower East Side, with the filmmaker trekking forward into a teeming art gallery. But then the experience begins: hand drawn animations start sneaking their way in, worming their way around and through the art works, before growing and proliferating in colors.It's hard to review this film without getting carried away with a discussion of its formal qualities. Yes, Minsker has packed every single millisecond of this film with something unexpectedly artistic: hand drawn animation, text, digital 2d animation, stop motion, claymation, cutouts, and I honestly don't even know what else; this thing is just teeming with artistic abundance.As these formal qualities are exploding on the screen, we meet our subject: the artist Scooter LaForge who immediately treats us to an explanation of their surrealist philosophy. They profess to practice psychic automatism, in which they deliberately shirk logical deliberation in favor of pure flow state (as he rides his elevator to his expensive Tribeca art studio, he tells himself to ""get dumb and stupid."") What makes all of this work is the equal parts dazzling and dizzying editing Minsker has performed on the film. Minsker gleefully acquaints us with Scooter's art, which is dirty, random, beautiful, aggressive, deep, and pulsing with some kind of socio-cultural consciousness. Minkser lets the art rip, and doesn't hold back on the visual overload that results. Maybe it's this marriage of Scooter LaForge's bold and brash revival of neo-expressionism with Minsker's equally creative editing style that gives us no choice but to believe that Scooter is the real deal. Or maybe it's seeing Beyoncé wear his work on the red carpet. Perhaps it's both.The most interesting aspect of any artist who labels themselves as engaging in ""psychic automatism"" is that even if their psychic process is automatic, it's still psychic. Scooter's art may defy and even satirize a fine art reading, but it can't escape art history; none of us can. But more interestingly, Scooter can't escape his own history. Something made this beautiful, wild man, and there's a culture and society that raised him. Though Scooter's art feels abstract, it's actually constantly representational. He seems equal parts inspired by cartoons as he is Rembrandt and the erotic murals of Pompeii. His work is arguably a formal improvement on Basquiat, adding more play and identification to the semiological vomit that made neo-Expressionism so exciting.Scooter tells us his reading material of choice in elementary school were the journals of Andy Warhol, and we aren't surprised. We are amazed though when his journey takes us from his cartoon-filled childhood to holding a bona-fide place in art history.I read the film as a portrait of the forces that undergird Scooter's automatism. We're taken through the critical life experiences that nudged them one way or the other, towards one idea or another. The details of their life are important and exciting, but it's the whole picture that Minsker renders that's so powerful. Scooter LaForge: A Life of Art leaves us staggered and in a state of wanting to cry. Only we're too intrigued by its playfulness to do so.Scooter doesn't profess to know what his place in art history will be, because he isn't an art historian. Well, luckily Ethan Minsker is, and the gift he has given us here is formidable. A must-see.",False
8,9,In-depth Look Into The Life of Artist Scooter LaForge,loveroffillm,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is fascinating to learn what brings art out in an artist and this documentary shares just that. The soundtrack and visuals used in editing added to the effects of the story in a way that was engaging, beautiful and it makes it feel like a true immersive and artistic experience. It is heartbreaking to learn the dark sides of life that people go thru and uplifting when you see someone who is fortunate enough to leave behind a toxic life. So is the life of LaForge. It was inspirational to witness him make his magic from a healthy place as opposed to so many others who have not been so lucky.His work of art is a self expression of his thoughts, ideas and creativity and we get to see so much of it thru the film. We also get to witness his imagination on screen by use of visual edits.I am glad I came across this documentary and that I learned about an artist I hadn't heard of before. I will definitely be following his work and hope some ends up in museums where they belong!A little spoiler here - Chanel copied his design! Bravo!! Definitely a recommended film!",True
9,9,Unveiling Mastery: Ethan Minsker's Cinematic Tribute to Scooter LaForge,jzmurdock,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ethan pinged me the other day to see if I would watch his new documentary about artist, Scooter LaForge.""Sure, I'd be happy to!"" As always.It took several days to finish my current project and finally get around to viewing his latest film.A few minutes into the film I remembered why Ethan's one of my favorite documentary filmmakers, realizing I should have put it on sooner.A ""creative"" documenting another ""creative"", an artist making a film about another artist, doesn't have to be the best art documentary you've seen. But in Ethan's case for some reason, it always is. As I've lived in both places, Scooter's life in New York City and his connections to the southwest, resonated with me. His time in San Francisco are also quite interesting, as is his personal history at large.With Scooter LaForge as his subject, you discover he's one of the greatest artists you've never heard of. Although many have. Especially other artists.Huffington Post:
""I BRAKE FOR SCOOTER LAFORGE.""
For good reason and I thank them for that.Here's the esteem I hold Ethan in as a filmmaker. In 2022 I produced a WWI documentary/art film that won a lot of awards around the world.I can't help now but watch Ethan's film and imagine how much better my film would be, had he also worked on it.If you like Art, or are striving to be an Artist, one thing you always learn from Ethan's films is there's a lot going on out there you just don't know about.So if you love Art, if you love Unique Characters, if you love stories told about them in creative and engaging ways?

10,9,Mesmerizing journey,adorjanmarcel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Initially unfamiliar with the subculture depicted in the film, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself connecting with Scooter's art on a profound level. Coming from a background of more traditional paintings that resonate with my own experiences, I was intrigued by how Scooter's art spoke to individuals whose perspectives I hadn't previously engaged with. It offered me a glimpse into a realm where life is perceived through a different lens, expanding my understanding of creativity.The documentary aslo raised intriguing questions about resilience, creativity, and the transformative power of art in the face of adversity.Ethan's presence in the documentary added an intriguing layer to the narrative, blurring the lines between filmmaker and subject.

This documentary was so well put together, with a wonderful balance of showing and telling and some cool, artsy special effects, stop motion/animation added such a satisfying pop. I loved learning about Scooter LaForge as an artist and person.

12,9,A Colorful Documentary about a brilliant Artist.,ath0629,n/a,16/08/2025,"This colorful documentary follows the career of Scooter LaForge during a few tumultuous times in the United States.As a queer teenager he struggled in a small town because he was not afraid to express his individuality. However, his struggles led him to San Francisco at the end of the AIDS crisis. After a few years, Scooter made his way to New York City, where most of the documentary takes place.Scooter takes inspiration from his own past as well as the history of the world and the struggles of the present such as the COVID and the death of George Floyd.I was most interested in his many collaborations and how they influenced and changed the way he expresses himself. As he began to collaborate with Patricia Field ( costume designer for Sex in the City) , fashion became one canvas he used to display his art. From paint to fabric he is able to express his unique vision of the world.

13,10,An Intimate Portrait of a Unique Artist,dickmays,n/a,16/08/2025,"Scooter LaForge is an artist, raised in by artist parents in New Mexico, who survived the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco, relocated to New York City where the artist's struggle to survive and thrive was further challenged by the Covid crisis. His openly gay sexuality was a target of bullying, and the compassion and empathy he has for others is beautifully displayed in this film by fellow artist Ethan Minsker.Scooter has a unique voice, influenced by classical masters, ancient history, and modern day social issues. His paintings inspired by Pompeii were particularly moving, graphically sexual with sudden annihilation from Mount Vesuvius, Scooter draws parallels to his days in San Francisco with its sexual freedom and AIDS devastation. Scooter experiences life very passionately, and his performance fellow artists who wear his clothing and collaborate with him obviously have great reverence for his vision.Many different filmmakers could have made a film about Scooter. But Ethan Minsker brings his own artistry to the endeavor. They are personal friends, and Minkser uses this knowledge to paint a very intimate portrait of Scooter. Minsker infuses his film with stop motion, visual graphics, and other artistry of his own making which I found extremely effective. Other viewers might find these added elements distracting, but to me it is what made the film such a fascinating portrait.This is a movie that other artists are likely to find very inspirational. I watched the film twice.",False
14,10,Fantastic highlight of a unique artist.,christopherfrint,n/a,16/08/2025,"I did not know anything about Scooter LaForge before viewing this documentary and now I want to learn even more! I had a great time watching this well paced documentary about Scooter. The way Ethan Minsker presented it was very unique and kept my attention to the screen. I was really invested in Scooters upbringing and how it led to him becoming a professional artist, that sort of passion can be quite infectious for people around Scooter and for the ones who take the time to view this documentary.

The artwork is not just beautiful, but the documentary itself is stylized and wonderfully filled with important face-paced information and close personal stories of Mr. LaForge and his surrounding network of friends, family, and fellow collaborators.

However this documentary explained to me the art in a way that was both easy to follow and informative.Knowing a lot of people who experimented with drugs and other unsavory behaviour (not me I am too innocent) it was interesting to see how he found his own form of inner peace. A lot of people are addicts one way or another and his art is well worth his need to create.As a lover of fashion it was intersting to see how he combined art with clothing. I am not sure if I could afford one of his pieces but the designs are very cool. Respect as well for him mentioning that his style is openly gay especially with the growing homophobia around.",False

21,10,"Really interesting, great film about art and Scooter",cwells-575-680347,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a surprise. I love art, so I love this very stylized documentary. I really liked how the director used color animations to interact with the live action. Scooter LeForge, an artist (surrealist) originally from New Mexico, was first inspirited by his parents but also draws inspiration from what's going on, from political to personal.The whole documentary is an art piece on its own because of the time and effort put into every scene, often in a surreal way. It showcases a lot of art pieces, which I really enjoyed. The film also maintains a pretty quick pace, so it's never boring.The director, Ethan Minster, doesn't just tell you about the artist Scooter LeForge but also infuses his own personal style into the film. This is especially evident in the use of graphic design as special effects throughout, where the director's eye and style intermingle with the art presented by Scooter and other artists showcased in the film. Having Scooter's mother be interviewed on a quirky TV was a nice touch. It's punk rock, it's surreal, and it's informative, immersing you in art. Super cool.It also tells the story of how Scooter was bullied in school for being gay and how his art became his outlet. It makes me want to create art because Scooter's style seems so effortless, yet you can tell it takes a lot of skill and unique vision. His art is awesome, and this film is a well-produced showcase. Scooter's art isn't for everyone, and that's probably why I'm particularly drawn to his work. It also has a lot to do with NYC, once again highlighting NYC as the art center of the world.This film is very visual, with constant effects that are fun to watch and play nicely with the subject matter. It's very freeing because Scooter often finds items on the street and turns them into art. How cool is that? This film also explores other artists, with a lot of interviews with people in the art scene, so you learn a lot. The Coronavirus cave painting by Scooter, where he transformed his whole apartment into an art piece, was one of my favorites because he used the feeling of being trapped during the lockdown as motivation to express himself. The film also covers topics like his sister being kicked out of the Navy for being gay, the George Floyd riots, not making money but finding a way to survive: all motivating the viewer to appreciate all forms of art. Maybe you'll pick up a paint brush.",False
22,9,Art-filled fun,kbrzoznowski,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew some about the artist before watching this doc, but knew more about the director (had seen other art docs by him). I came away with a new appreciation for the art Scooter does and for the way a director can match the energy of a subject. Both are vibrant, colorful and fun - in the same way that Scooter's art is playful (but with a point), the doc techniques were the perfect mirror to it. No interviews felt like throwaways, the bright animation used to illustrate talking points gave it added interest and I could see myself wanting to watch docs on a few of the side characters in this too.",False

Minsker's unique style of filmmaking complements LaForge's artistic soul, and the film enhances what is already an epic life's work. There's a deeply vulnerable undertone, ever present. These two find a synergy and communion in the way they attack art and the art world. While the documentary is foremost a portrait of LaForge, his past and present as an artist in NYC, the film itself is a piece of Minsker's art, and these two realities don't battle each other. They work hand in hand to reflect the vitality that is the NYC art scene, as it lives and breathes today.",False

25,10,A film that takes on its subject's approach to art by transforming itself into an art object.,hrrygrnbrg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ethan Minsker, in his latest documentary film Scooter LaForge: A Life Of Art, takes up the implicit challenge posed by his own subject's work by constructing this film in such a way that it brings together all possible elements, ingredients, and additives to transform itself into an object of art in and of itself. The film does so, very cleverly and very entertainingly, by treating each scene, each shot, each segment itself, as a piece of art, whether by 'painting' directly on the image, animating an imaginary scenario to illustrate a point, playing with sound, or by simply depicting the creation of the artist's work in new and inventive ways.In the same sort of style that the artist attacks his pieces by painting on oddball existing items, connecting seemingly unrelated found items, or deconstructing familiar items. It's quite a challenge to properly execute those techniques or evoke those approaches within the medium of filmmaking, but Minsker, along with his many deviously clever collaborators, manages to do just that. And he makes it look easy, while still making the film experience fun and always surprising.If you're at all fascinated with the current art world and with those who still manage to live a life of art in this increasingly commodified world, this film is for you.",False

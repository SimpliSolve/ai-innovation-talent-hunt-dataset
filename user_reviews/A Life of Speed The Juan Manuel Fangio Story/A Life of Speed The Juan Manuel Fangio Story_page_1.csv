2,7,"A worthy celebration, but somewhat passionless",malcp,n/a,16/08/2025,"I read Fangio - his autobiography - about 40 years ago and remember seeing him at races and being interviewed and it is difficult to express quite how iconic a figure he was in life as well as in racing history. This film does address that in it's interviews with drivers like Stewart and Prost, but somehow it's coverage of his racing career is bland. Archive footage of 1950's motor sport is somewhat limited, but dressing it up by dubbing on a retro-style commentary didn't work for me and I also found it distracting that not all the clips match the races being described in the commentary. Aspects of his career that were massively significant - his crash at Monza in 1952, the 1957 German Grand Prix and his kidnapping in1958 are covered - although the kidnapping is barely touched upon - but somehow the sum is less than the parts. This guy was an absolute legend, but somehow they've reduced him to a collection of facts.",False
3,6,The life of a legend,bastos,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a technically competently made doc on the life of Juan Manuel Fangio, one of the greatest drivers of all time. It is nice to have some of Formula 1's greatest legends talk about one of their idols and the impact he had on their lives. It is pretty informative on the F1 side but it lacks on the more personal side. His life had a lot of incredible situations (he was kidnapped by Cubans for Chrissake!) that are barely mentioned and I think there should have been a lot more emphasis on the Ascari death, which isn't even mentioned! So all in all it's a decent doc that feels a bit incomplete.",False
4,6,No storytelling,polarb8,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is kinda sad that when there is good story to tell, had a chance to interview with some special names in Formula 1 history, but there is no storytelling. Time didn't pass while I was watching, several times I checked the bottom bar to see how many minutes to end. In my opinion; unfortunately this documentary is not so successful about reflecting Fangio's legacy.
But in otherside, it is good to see the old and original aspects of Formula 1 and motorsport history. If interested, then it might worth see it.",False
5,7,Illuminates Why Fangio Is So Highly Regarded,iquine,n/a,16/08/2025,(Flash Review)Was Juan Manuel Fangio the best F1 driver of all time? He is known as the godfather of F1 as he was the best and most accomplished driver it the early 40s-50s era and held the record of 5 World Championships until Schumacher finally topped him at the turn on the century. He was also able to win championships with several different manufacturers; a rarity. There is some great early racing footage in here. The documentary is straightforward and not creative except from a vague analysis they concocted to pick a best driver over every era. Guess who they picked...?,False
6,10,Amazing piece of racing history!!!! Wonderfully made.,lerooyy,n/a,16/08/2025,I cannot believe the people that give this documentary a low star review! So much love time and effort went into making this. Viewers are so damn ungrateful these days! You make it if you think you can do better.Loved watching every second of this. Thank you!!The average rating is bogus! Doesn't reflect the documentary at all.Wish there where more stories like this available online.Amazing.,False
7,7,A very captivating film,Mysterygeneration,n/a,16/08/2025,"""A Life of Speed: The Juan Manuel Fangio Story"" is a very captivating film that properly pays homage to one of the greatest legends of Formula One. Archive footage combines in this documentary with expert testimony and comments from Fangio himself; readers can relish both the intensity and elegance of a racing career that has become the watermark generations later. While this documentary on the entire career of Juan Manuel Fangio is first and foremost oriented to appeal to racing fans, it makes his story accessible and inspiring to a larger audience by showing not only his extraordinary skill behind the wheel but also the humble and determined character that made him a champion. Though sometimes the documentary glides over some tricky areas in his life, it is still reverent toward Fangio's legacy and portrays old-school motorsport with a real sense of excitement-for this reason, it's an absolute must-see for any fan of sport and history.",False
8,4,Disappointing.,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"I follow modern F1, but I'll admit my history is patchy. I know Juan Manuel Fangio of course, one of the very best... if not the best, but there's opportunity to learn much more. However, the bar is set high for documentaries these days and this doesn't really reach that bar. It's quite formulaic, pretty dry, certainly in the opening half hour which is a dull history lesson through Fangio's initiation into motor racing. Granted I learn he started at a surprisingly late age by today's standards, being 37 when he first raced in Europe. It was a different time in motor sport, near impossible to compare today's drivers to those from Fangio's era and the pacing of A Life of Speed grinds to a halt as this topic is covered. Today it's marginal gains, fast reaction speed, different tracks, radically different cars. There was no desire for comfort in the 50s and little thought to safety. I only mention this as it sadly seems to be the key point of the film. There's lots of familiar faces, Stewart, Prost, HÃ¤kkien, Rosberg, Alonso, Wolff, coupled with plenty of archive footage, but it feels as much a history of F1 and motor racing as Fangio himself and nothing particularly new. Senna's death, the horrific crash at Le Mans and some archive audio dubbing that sounds slightly suspect. Much is made of Fangio's achievements, winning 5 championships with 4 different constructors, but this feels bolted on and really should have been the central theme. For me that's where this suffers, structurally it's very loose, well intentioned, but lacking pace and a good story arc. Frankly I think Fangio deserves better.4/10",False
9,1,Drowned by muzak,simonlodal,n/a,16/08/2025,"I want engine noise! All I got was a wall of pointless background music, drowning out both voice and noise. Could not stand to keep watching (hearing) that.",False
10,n/a,I really liked this movie - F1 History,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really liked this movie and the F1 History. If you love cars and the F1 you should watch it. The movie is the story of Juan Manuel Fangio, the Argentinean won 5 times F1 world champion. He manged to win driving Mercedes-Bez, Ferrari, Maserati and Alfa Romeo. He was the only driver to win F1 championship with all these cars and that's why he is the best ever F1 driver.",True

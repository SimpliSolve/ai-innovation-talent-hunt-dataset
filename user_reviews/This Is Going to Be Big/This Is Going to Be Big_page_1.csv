1,10,Great Show Full of Laughs and Heart,symfonyman-62245,n/a,16/08/2025,"The director and editors did an excellent job here. I saw a preview of the show and thought it looked interesting because WAY back in the day, I used to do the high school play thing.I would get nervous before a performance and had dreams of forgetting my lines for years afterward. This led me to wonder how a group of neurodiverse people would handle the pressure... The answer, of course, is that it's the same. There are normal levels of self pressure (Halle to be the best for her Aunt), self doubt (Chelsea wondering if she could physically do it without passing out), and self discovery.It's all cut in with Wet Hot American Summer style interstitials of a PA rattling off a comment while kids play rugby.You will laugh and you will cry, and if you are an American like me you just might learn a little bit about John Farmhouse(?).By the end you will feel the pride that the audience must have felt during the final performance.I look forward to seeing what the director does next. Also if Chelsea isn't working on a stand up routine, someone point her in the right direction. She should be on stage making people laugh. Maybe an idea for a follow up documentary?",False

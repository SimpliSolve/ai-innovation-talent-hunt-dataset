1,7,I Got The Irish In Me,cdlistguy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a bit of fun. My only complaint is that they overdid the immigration aspect of the story. Their personal feelings about it were fine; it was just that the emphasis on the history of it, readily available elsewhere, took over the second part of the movie to a degree. As a result, it diluted some of the ""will they do it?"" excitement. With the right directior and editor, this could have been a nailbaiting one hour special!",False
2,9,Beautiful Storya Ajor,billcr12,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have some Irish blood and I loved The is My Home. Dave Browne and Dave Rooney are two musicians who live in Vegas. They travel to every state in America to play a gig and set a Guinness Book of World Records. Along the way(14,000 miles) and a shortage of cash, the pair struggle to finish their dream. It is a tour of the American landscape with a good deal of drinking and laughter. Immigration is a major theme and sometimes we need to be reminded that our ancestors came here for a better life. One of the best films of the year.",False

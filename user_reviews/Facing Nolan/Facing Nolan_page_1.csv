1,8,Big Tex,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"SXSW 2022
Greetings again from the darkness. Having been a baseball fan for as long as I can remember, I can list the handful of players that I got to see play in person who left me in utter awe of their talent. Lynn Nolan Ryan was definitely one of them, so when I saw Bradley Jackson's documentary listed on the SXSW schedule, I immediately sent my RSVP.Jackson opens with the numbers: 7 no-hitters, 100.9 mph, 5714 career strikeouts, and 51 Major League Baseball records. Big Tex. The Ryan Express. If he wasn't flesh and blood, Nolan Ryan could be the lead character in a graphic novel. An intimidating player with a Texas drawl borne of his upbringing in tiny Alvin, Texas. We see a fuzzy clip of Nolan pitching in high school, and his wife Ruth drives us by his childhood home. As a long-time fan, I'm relieved to see that Ruth Ryan is finally exposed as a guiding force in his life and career. Their first date is recalled ... watching ROME ADVENTURE (Suzanne Pleshette, Troy Donahue) ... as is their second - a baseball game to see Sandy Koufax pitch. Ruth explains that Nolan had no aspirations of a professional baseball career, and instead was determined to become a veterinarian. It was Mets' scout Red Murff who changed the trajectory of animals and hitters everywhere when he convinced the team to draft Nolan.Jackson includes interviews with players such as Pete Rose, Randy Johnson, and Jerry Grote (his catcher with the Mets). Rose talked about how difficult it was to face Nolan, while Johnson labels him the most intimidating pitcher of all-time. Others interviewed include Ryan's biographer Rob Goldman and former President George W Bush, who was one of the team owners when Ryan signed with the Texas Rangers.Some terrific archival footage shows Nolan's World Series contribution to the 1969 Miracle Mets, his subsequent trade to Gene Autry's (""The Singing Cowboy"") California Angels, and his early no-hitters and dominance. We learn about the impact of Tom Morgan, his first ""real"" pitching coach, and later, Ryan's stunning free agent contract with the Houston Astros - making him the first athlete to sign a million-dollar contract. Jackson even includes the replay of the moment in 1973 when Norm Cash came to the plate with a table leg instead of bat to face Ryan during his second career no-hitter.More footage is shown of Ryan's 5th and 6th no-hitters, including Terry Puhl's running catch. What a fun moment it is when Mr. Puhl proves that, even to this day, he still has the clip of that catch on his iPhone. And yes, it was the Astros' blunder of inviting Nolan to take a 'hometown' pay cut, that drove him to sign with the cross-state rival Texas Rangers and write the final chapter of his storied baseball career. What followed was his 300th win, his 5000th strikeout, and remarkably, his 7th no-hitter. Of course, one of the most famous events of Ryan's career occurred in 1993 when Robin Ventura charged the mound against the 46-year-old Ryan. What's fascinating is how this is tied back to a previous incident with Dave Winfield years ago. Winfield discusses what happened, while Ryan admits to the impact.The baseball content served up here is enough for any fan, but the real insight comes from the talks with Ruth and Nolan and their family members. Sure, he spent 27 years in the league and delivered a humble Hall of Fame induction speech (which is included here), but at the core of the player is the man with values ... the man Ruth chose so many years ago. The kids and grandkids speak of Nolan and Ruth as role models, and we witness firsthand the difference between the Hall of Fame pitcher and the man fishing on the riverbank or at the head of the table for family meals. We have Red Murff and Tom Morgan to thank for the pitching, Ruth Ryan to thank for the man, and Bradley Jackson to thank for this profile.",False
2,9,Ryan million $,canuckguymm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just want to clarify as mentioned in the documentary about Nolan Ryan being the only player in any sport to receive a million dollar contract.Bobby Hull playing hockey on the WHA 1972 had a million dollar contract before NR.Was a well presented documentary, absolutely mind-boggling how Nolan Ryan did not win a Cy Young award .I watched Nolan Ryan pitch a few times and it was always an amazing display how hard he can throw that ball.Nolan Ryan and Ferguson Jenkins are my two favorite pictures of all time.108 mph fastball is just incredible considering he did not have much training in regards to weight training or coaching.Congratulations on a great career and Hall of Fame enshrinement.",False
3,8,Almost Pitch Perfect,ThatMonkey,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been telling people for years that Fastball is the best documentary of all time. Not the best sport doc, but the best doc!Fastball is compelling, informative and the reveal in the final scenes pretty much set up this doc. Watching this documentary, I had one continuous gripe with this film. Instead of it being a love letter from fans, it comes off as a love letter from his family. Sorry, I get it, your dad, husband and grandfather are a legend, but family praise never comes off as genuine as fan or peer praise.I got way too much of his son which became so clear when the credit roll and you see he is the main producer, Family praise makes up at least 20% of this film and that is about twice as much that was acceptable. There is a touching scene with the whole family at one point, but that should have truly been the majority of the family involvement. Dave Winfield, George Brett and Pete Rose add amazing color. I would have loved Bo Jackson's take, but I suspect Bo doesn't like being on film, despite having the best 30 for 30 of all time.I learned a lot here and Hall of Fame players added great perspective and had they stuck with that formula, this would be an absolute 10. I still recommend this movie, just think that it unfortunately got bastardized by too much family involvement.",False
4,10,It's Hard Not To Be Romantic.....,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"About baseball.It's somewhat corny but so incredibly true for any fan of the game.I've had the honor of watching so many greats of the game- Randy Johnson, Curt Schilling, Doc Goodin, Steve Stone,Justin Verlander, Roy Halladay, Roger Clemens, Pedro Martinez, Clayton Kershaw, Greg Maddux, Mark Buehrle, Nolan Ryan.To watch a truly great pitcher is like watching a great artist paint a masterpiece- Nolan truly was one of the greats of the game. His skill and artistry were truly something to behold and that someone did such a momentous documentary while he was still living is brilliant. We have an horrible history of waiting until they're gone before we recognize the talent when it was walking amongst us for so long. I've met Nolan on a few occasions and he's every bit as humble and kind as he seems here and it's a true testament to the man.Thank you for a beautiful piece on a great talent- it's a great piece on a great man. And as a tried and true Chicago White Sox fan, I can say I've never been more disappointed than I have in Robin Ventura not making a comment on one of the best pitchers to ever play and one of the very worst boxing matches ever in the history of the game.",False
5,10,A must-see for every baseball fan!,christinajane-97528,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never written a review, but I couldn't pass up an opportunity to say what a fabulous documentary this is. Ryan is a legend and this captures it so perfectly. Hearing/seeing his story through the lens and voices of his wife, Ruth, his children and grandchildren, his former teammates....it was just amazing. An inspirational reminder of why I love this game so dang much!",False
6,10,A must watch for any fan of baseball (or any sports fan),tontogringo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started ""Facing Nolan"" thinking ""this will probably be dumb or boring, but I gotta check it out. It's Nolan Ryan."" I did not regret it. It was fun, interesting, and I actually learned several things I never knew.If you're thinking about checking this movie out, just do it.",False
7,10,A Wonderful Mix Of Baseball Exploits And Behind-The-Scenes Family Material,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nolan Ryan might be one of the most oddly-perceived star baseball players of all-time. On one hand, he was clearly dominant: 27 seasons (parts of four decades), strikeout record by a mile, 7 no-hitters, etc. His career arc (Texas native starring for both TX major league teams) also propelled him to almost mythic status. At the same time, however, he set some ignominious records-walks allowed, wild pitches, etc.-and his overall numbers (besides the big ones) don't look as ""clean"" as others. A fascinating figure, to be sure, and all of that-plus some great glimpses into his current/family life-is bandied about here in ""Facing Nolan"".At heart, this doc is a pretty standard biography of Ryan. Director Bradley Jackson begins with Nolan's Alvin, TX upbringing and then chronicles early-career stints with the Mets & Angels. Then, of course, comes the dominating return to Texas-Astros-and finally his last few seasons with the Rangers, where his legend grew to mythic status. Along the way, Jackson gathers input from Nolan's wife, sons, and daughter to flesh out who Ryan was when not at the ballpark.In fact, ""Facing Nolan"" has a very ""family"" feel to it, what with his sons-Reid & Reese-listed as executive producers. While some might say that could provide an overly-sympathetic look at Ryan's career/life, I never got those vibes here. In all actuality, I found the material on Nolan's wife to be some of the best of the entire doc. Scenes from modern-day Nolan working his cattle ranch and hanging out with his grandchildren were also quite touching and highly enjoyable in seeing where this momentous figure's life has taken him.Aside from the archival footage and familial input, interviews with Ryan himself and his contemporaries (George Brett, Craig Biggio, Randy Johnson, Ivan Rodriguez, George W. Bush, and many others) populate ""Facing Nolan"" and are always engaging. In a bit of an odd quirk, I actually found Nolan's direct input a bit boring at first, only to come to understand (over the course of the doc) that his laconic style is simply his personality and always has been.Despite my top-shelf 10 star rating, ""Facing Nolan"" isn't a perfect documentary. The narration can be a bit over-the-top (perhaps even corny) and there are certain themes introduced that aren't carried over throughout. But for whatever reason, the entire effort seemed to ""hit"" at the right time and elicit real emotion from this viewer. I learned that Nolan Ryan's baseball impact can't be measured by the pure numbers so often used to evaluate the players of today, and I smiled at his post-career journey to find purpose in his ranching and family life. In short, I had such a good time-and experienced so many different emotions-watching ""Facing Nolan"" that I couldn't give it anything less than the full 10 stars.",False
8,7,This Film Delivers Just Like the Ryan Express,KinoBuff2021,n/a,16/08/2025,"Facing Nolan (2022) maintains its integrity and consistently delivers the life and career of Nolan Ryan in a way that keeps even the non-baseball fans intrigued.This documentary says it take a slight curve of the typical biographical documentary, but its still pretty similar. But as its description implies, Nolan Ryan's life and career is told from the perspective of the ""batters"" he faced in his life whether they be family setting him up for a challenge, coaches and executives questioning his ability to pitch , or actual baseball players he had gallantly opposed while on the mound. Ryan could not have had his career without these challengers constantly pushing him to improve and compete against his competition.This is a pretty solid documentary. I liked the narrative , the many interviews (like the many batters he pitched against), and the use and explanation of the numbers fans and enemies use to describe is Hall of Fame career. My only complaint is that it while it remained truthful, this movie could be a little too sentimental making it stray from main narrative. But it always came back eventually.Give it a watch. Even if you don't like baseball, you will be astonished by Nolan Ryan's career and legacy.",False
9,10,Excellent documentary,tom_sloop,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFor some reason Nolan Ryan has always been a polarizing figure. From Jim Palmer winning the Cy Young in 1973, to the six voters who didn't vote for Ryan to get in the Hall of Fame. I knew reaction to this documentary would be much of the same regardless of the quality. So, because of this I wasn't even going to bother writing a review. However, some things were said in a previous review that need to be addressed.First of the all, the incident in which Ryan goes after the batter, or ""headhunting"", was shown in the movie. It involved Robin Ventura. It was shown from several angles and discussed thoroughly. If Ventura didn't want to get taken to the woodshed, then don't charge the mound.The second point is the ridiculous steroid point. Anyone who didn't see him pitch a nine inning game with the Angels or his first two years with Houston... go find the old film. Radar guns did not exist back then. They were trying to clock him with equipment that was not suited for that environment. They used the same equipment on today's pitchers side by side with a radar gun and converted the number to 108 mph. His peers use the word ""better"" and everyone loses their mind. The first 15 years of his career he had one pitch. The next 12 he had three. Yes the steroid era happened. #1 his dominance was before the era began #2 he was a workout warrior with minimal muscle gain... not really how steroids work.Want to point at his career walks - fine. Want to concentrate on his career win loss percentage - fine. But leave the bush league stuff at the door.",True
10,7,'Facing Nolan' Documents One of the Most Intimidating Pitchers in Baseball History,info-13436,n/a,16/08/2025,"Facing Nolan
Rating: 7/10
Director & Writer: Bradley Jackson
Style: Sports Documentary
Time: 105 minutesNolan Ryan now looks back on his career in this documentary
Review by Mike Szymanski
Even if you are not a baseball fan, this is a fascinating documentary about a family man who shows how the support of his wife and three children helped make him a star in his sports profession.Even if you don't know much about baseball, you may have heard the name Nolan Ryan who was an intimidating pitcher to stand up against during his time in the game. He struck everyone out. Older, younger, newer players, even fathers and later their sons, in the pro league. None of them could get a hit off of Nolan's 100-plus mph pitches.And, if you are from Texas, you know his name as someone who is a legend.One of the biggest fans of Nolan, who plays prominently in the documentary, is former president George W. Bush. He recalls some of Ryan's biggest sports moments, and remembers some of Ryan's biggest plays. He puts the guy squarely in Texas history as a hero.Throughout the documentary there are photos of Ryan with the likes of former president Bill Clinton and Muhammad Ali and other superstars.However, this documentary is not about the famous people Ryan met, but about the family around him. One daughter says she recalls when her father put a guy in a headlock on the pitcher's mound and immediately thought, ""I am not going to get a date anymore."" Already most of the guys she went out with were intimidated by her dad, and this would only make her dating possibilities worse.And when the family was told that Ryan appeared in a soap opera, not surprisingly called ""Ryan's Hope,"" they watched it online and one of the family members critiqued: ""It's a good thing you stuck with baseball, not acting.""
Nolan's rise to become the most dominating pitcher the game has ever seen, as one expert says, is something that his wife, Ruth, had to contend with early on in their relationship. She notes that she was told early on by a friendly coach that she would have to share her husband with the world of baseball. She didn't want to do that at first, but realized pretty quickly that she would have to, and she did.Ruth remembers their first date together in 1967. He took her to a movie called ""Rome Adventure"" and the romance continued for a lifetime. They knew each other in school; he was voted Most Handsome, she was voted Most Beautiful. He was known for his fast pitch, and he ran a cattle ranch on the off-season in case his baseball plans didn't pan out.Ruth Nolan talks about supporting him from the beginning of his baseball career
On their second date, he took Ruth to a ballgame to watch Sandy Colfax pitch, and studied his every move. Within 10 years of watching that game, he would have broken all of Colfax's records.Nolan wracked up 51 major league records, and many of them are because he is the oldest to accomplish a few baseball records while in his 40s.With his decades in the game, Ryan accomplished 5,714 strikeouts. He struck out all sorts of superstars. He also got seven no-hitter games in a row.Nolan was a reliever in the 1969 World Series ""Miracle Mets"" and four years later led the league with 329 strikeouts. He was also the first Major League player to earn a salary of $1 million.At the young age of 22, Nolan had a World Series Ring, and he went with his team on the Ed Sullivan Show to sing ""You've Got to Have Heart.""
Ruth recalled the year he was involved with the World Series, and laughs that it was the first - and last - time she ever tried champagne.Some of the baseball superstars in this documentary, like Pete Rose and Rod Carew are fascinating enough to see, especially how they talk with fondness about Nolan Ryan.His pitch was clocked at more than 100 miles per hour, but others believed it to be much faster. Some insist at least 180 mph.A culmination in Nolan's career happened on August 4, 1993, and is one of the most common questions he still gets asked about today. Robin Ventura was the Chicago White Sox third baseman who charged the pitcher's mound after Ryan hit him with a pitch. Ryan grabbed Ventura in a headlock like he would use for his cows and knocked him on the head before an all-out brawl ensued.Player Robin Ventura declined to be interviewed for the documentary, so it says in a scroll. That's unfortunate because it would have been nice to hear his side.The end of Nolan's career is sad. He was stopped in the middle of a game when his elbow was significantly bothering him due to a torn ligament. Only age could stop ""The Express"" and he never got to continue the game, or get back into the game ever again.His wife Ruth talked about how she cried during that game, knowing it was the end of his career, and she teared up while remembering it.In real life, the director became a dad during the making of the documentary, and he said he thinks that subconsciously he hoped to create a movie that celebrated achieving greatness with the love and support of people around you.Nolan ""is someone who always put family first, carried the banner for his state, and showed the sporting world what hard work and endurance is all about,"" said director Jackson.Joshua Myer's country music score in the film is delightful and fun, and perfect for the backdrop of the documentary. The documentary baseball footage is priceless, as well as the scenes driving through Alvin, Texas, where Ruth whimsically points out a tree that Nolan planted in the front yard of the family house.Facing Nolan and his pitch might have been scary, but the reality is that he seems like a great family man, and is a national hero.###",False
11,10,How is this not a 10,kchick-20272,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you even like baseball and you haven't seen it, you don't know what you are missing.Those who have been around a while will appreciate the wonderful history that keeps coming. From Tom Seaver to Bo Jackson and every where in between. The longevity of this man is an anomaly at the least. For those of us who have been fortunate enough to see in person this ""anomaly"" we were witness to as good as it gets along with the personal character we all hope we can have and instill into our own children. I personally am proud to say I have met Mr. Ryan, and he is just as you see.Facing Nolan: It's worth every God-damn second of your time!",False
12,4,Meh,sfbetts,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI paid attention to Ryan's career. I hope it was more dynamic and better organized than this documentary.If you go strictly by this film Ryan was a yawner who did stuff that was great.No discussion in any depth of his style, his attitude, his thought processes while pitching, what drove him, what kept him going.It's almost as if everyone got together at the start and agreed to keep it superficial and worshipful and to hide any insights or complexity from sight.Too bad. I was happy when I saw the documentary was available.Helped me pass a small piece of a Saturday night.Very bland, lifeless portrait with way too much Mrs. Nolan Ryan
Amateurish and dull.",True
13,10,You Don't Have to Be a Fan to Love This,coachsalm,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a must watch for every sports fan, and non-sports fans will enjoy this as well. Nolan's career arc coincided with the prime of my life as an athlete and sports fan, and I feel like I 'grew up,' watching him.It is rare that an all-time great athlete is also underrated. This seems like it would be impossible, and yet when you look at his career and notoriety, I feel that Ryan is underrated and under appreciated.Ryan pitched in a day when you could watch your local team pretty much every day, but rarely did you see the superstar players from other teams almost every day, like you can today. So players like Ryan existed, mostly, in a fan's imagination; you could read the accounts in the newspaper, and imagine what a player did, and then hopefully get a glimpse of him when he played your hometown team.This documentary does a good job of making you feel what it might have been like to see Ryan pitch regularly, while gaining a better appreciation for his greatness.It was a treat to grow up watching him play, and a treat to watch this documentary.",False

15,8,Strikeout Story on the Silver Screen!!,mjpiro,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFacing Nolan is the 2022 documentary of the story of one of the greatest pitchers in Major League Baseball history, right hander Nolan Ryan. Ryan was from Texas but was originally drafted by the New York Mets baseball club but did not find great personal success there. The team did find collective success winning the 1969 World Championship though!! Ryan was mainly used out of the bullpen as a Met, and the hard throwing right hander always saw himself as a starting pitcher so after three seasons in the big apple the tall Texan was traded to sunny Southern California where he became a member of the then California Angels. It was there that Ryan met up with a pitching coach, a coach that he did not have with the Mets or in high school. Ryan started to have tremendous success. First off, the Angels were a bit of a struggling franchise so they put the right hander in their starting rotation and after his work with the pitching coach Ryan's strikeout numbers grew exponentially, so much so that he threw over 300 per season for his three years in Anaheim!! Things eventually soured with the Angels and Ryan wanted to go back to Texas and play there professionally anyway so in the mid 1970's the Ryan Express signed professional sports first million dollar contract with the Houston Astros. Ryan found immediate success with the Astros, throwing a no-hitter for the club and taking a team that had never seen the post-season to the post-season and within one game of the World Series in 1980. In the mid to late 1980's though, Ryan was asked to take a pay cut with the Astros to sign more players to the team, and the team itself was going in a different direction, so the fireball throwing right hander decided to test free agency and signed with the upstate Texas Rangers. Ryan's success continued with Texas, firing two more no hitters and compiling some 51 major league records all told that still hold up to today!! The documentary is very well done. The testimonials in it are great as are the baseball highlights. You get a great sense of who Nolan Ryan and his family are and there is a great sense of nostalgia as you see the highlights throughout his career. 8 out of 10 stars.",True
16,9,The Ryan Express Sizzles and Pops,iquine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jaw Dropping.Seeing in true context, Nolan Ryan's stats and records is truly jaw dropping.His stats are truly unbelievable, which if you don't know his big ones and you aren't a serious baseball fan or too young, then halt what you are doing, watch, and learn. I won't waste time listing them. This documentary encapsulates his entire baseball career from a young tike to his very last pitch while mixing in his meaningful family life. It shows all his big moments and has lots of comments from players, teammates and even people who played with him in high school. It was special to hear from his wife, his childhood sweetheart, to see what it was like to live with him during his 27-year career. Yah, 27 years of throwing heat! They did highlight his toughness and mental toughness. It was interesting to get further background on the ill-advised time Robin Venture charged the mound on Ryan. (he declined to be interviewed) But guess who pulled Nolan out from under that pile of guys............Bo Jackson! From the opposing team no less. Just another reason to love that dude. They did show Bo taking Ryan deep to show that Ryan was human. They also dove into Ryan pitching with a bloody face and uniform and how much more intimidating that would have been to face him looking like he won a barroom brawl. I never remembered how his career ended. Sort of like a 90+ year old dying. Sobering and sad, yet it had to happen someday, so you quickly think back to a life lived to its fullest. This was a well-paced and smartly edited documentary that was highly informative and entertaining.",False
17,10,This is a 12 really. Remarkably well done.,laurelhardy-12268,n/a,16/08/2025,"I told my wife I'd like her to take a gander at this. I had watched 15 minutes the night before and then saved it on Netflix.She had watched the grandkids all day, so typically she would've bombed out early. And she is not big on documentaries, particularly ones around sports.Evelyn was glued to the TV for the entire hour and 45 minutes. I know y'all don't know my wife, but that's a testament to just how good this documentary is.Here's the thing: so many documentaries, even with fascinating subject matter, quite often become slow and/or stale. Not so here.The balance between Nolan's life in Baseball, his wife & family, and his childhood; are perfectly balanced. And with guests such as Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens & others, it's really excellent.Keep in mind, it probably should be with Nolan's incredibly storied career.I'm 70, so I saw Sandy Koufax play for the Dodgers. And, Nolan Ryan, when he started out. And I watched him suffer for so long playing for the 'Disneyland Angels'; (as my older brother so aptly dubbed Autry's terrible team back in the day.)And I was always amazed that a fireballer could have a career go on over 15 years. Well, he blew that number out of the water.The crux of it is twofold: His longevity and the 51 major league records he still holds to this day. 7 no hitters!?!? Really? 5800+ strike outs!?!! Really. That's a 1000 more than the 2nd place guy Randy Johnson (who sings Nolan's praises throughout this documentary, as well as other great players.).So that's it. Best moving documentary ever. Kept light, fun and breezy, but doesn't scrimp on the heavy moments.This is a 12 on a scale from 1 - 10. And I've never said that before about any movie or documentary.Nolan's career in the majors was not just remarkable, not merely stellar, but indeed, it was truly astonishing.And this documentary captures it in a very accurate and fun fashion.ThxBob R.",False
18,3,"Ponderous, engaging and a glaring Problem",paul-2569,n/a,16/08/2025,"A nostalgic view of Nolan Ryan's amazing career, and sort of an old fashioned doc about days gone by - BUT they revel in how great he did after turning 40 and totally ignore the many accounts of his possible steroid use, in an era of baseball and steroids, which would also go a long way to explaining that late career surge. There's also an annoying hagiography where anything remotely controversial is just glossed over, and one of his most famous moments -- a fight after he went head-hunting at a batter -- is not even included. Enjoy, but it's more of a lovelyromantic homage than a real, honest doc.",False

1,1,"The Most Intellectually Dishonest, UnAmerican Filth Imaginable",leftbanker-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"You would expect nothing less from Tucker Carlson, but even for this bargain-basement propagandist, he has really hit rock-bottom.This comes at a time when President Biden is trying to orchestrate the biggest transfer of wealth in human history, from the rich to the poor, America's working poor. He is being hampered at every step by Republicans who are defending a few hundred billionaires. I defy anyone to name a single thing that Trump did to aid the workers of America. His signature bit of legislation was to lower taxes for the rich.",False
2,10,Prove him wrong..,popscott-03157,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone has bashed Tucker... no one has proven his documentary false... Please provide us with YOUR investigation and results of why his claims in his documentary are false... Save your ""Tucker is a bad man"" for someone else. Save your link to someone else's opinion or your ""experts"" telling you (not me) how Tucker is bad.",False
3,10,Reviewing the Patriot Purge portion,gmac-9,n/a,16/08/2025,"What I liked most about the series of three episodes called Patriot Purge, is that it is largely made up of people telling their own accounts of what they saw and heard.We can acknowledge that Carlson himself, has a particular bias to one side of the story, and there are certainly some filmed scenes and pictures to sway a narrative, but his documentary also comes with a lot of real-life video evidence and personal account interviews to let the viewer see and decide for themselves in most cases.This offers a better approach to reporting, than a talking head on a TV screen just telling you what they want you to believe and/or how you should interpret what happened... rather than just showing you what happened and letting you decide.Your opinion of 1/6 can be whatever you want, but at least this series gives you some real information to consider.",False
4,1,Just inching out some cash the best way he knows how..peddling junk,wbsimsjr-32405,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are a few old school 'journalists' around fox..Chris Wallace has always been someone I feel I can consume what he conveys as news... tucker isn't 1/1000 of a percent as good as a news journalist. For those ""Please provide us with YOUR investigation and results of why his claims in his documentary are false.."" Unlike any other time in history, We (that means everyone) have access to astounding and troubling video evidence for a civil unrest event, people see and hear what transpired.. and listen to a president give hugs and kisses to those that were intent to hang the Vice President and kill Pelosi.. If this were the ""Great America"" that trump eludes to (presumably the 40's/50's) He and everyone associated with this event would have already been jailed. Carlson like any other propagandist from any authoritarian time period, marches to the Masters beat for recognition and or profit.. I wonder how many people teach their children the same value system of these people.............",False

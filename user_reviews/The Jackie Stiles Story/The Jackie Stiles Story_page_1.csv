1,10,Fans of Womens basketball will love this!,lholt-880-787691,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you were fortunate enough to watch Jackie play the game of basketball, you will love this story. If you know Jackie personally, you will love this story. If you are a basketball fan who has never heard of Jackie Stiles, you will love this story. With sheer heart and determination, Jackie elevated herself to the pinnacle of her sport. Her coaches and teammates adored her. And when she encountered the toughest opponent of her life, she attacked it in the same manner as all others-with laser-like focus and a resolute offensive game plan. You will be inspired and appreciate the humble, selfless person she is. This is a must see film!",False
2,10,Very well done,robb-98626,n/a,16/08/2025,"This story is well done. It highlights the talents, and personality of a wonderful person who just happens to be a great athlete. The reason she was/is such an exceptional basketball player is because of who she is as a person. This should serve as an outline for young athletes to follow to become the best they can be in life and on the court or field. It is not just lips service either. The things she did on the court are proven by film. There are funny things that make Jackie real as well. Her family is humble and are just good midwestern people. Jackie is a testament to her upbringing. I especially liked the comment from her teammate regarding being so competitive. As in just walking to class and needing to ""win"" that walk!!",False
3,10,Such an Inspiration,gma5times,n/a,16/08/2025,It is so nice to see such a down to earth and humble star. Absolutely an inspiration and great example of work ethic and humility winning out in the end. Jackie has faced success and setback with the same wonderful determination. This is a really good uplifting documentary. No self-aggrandizing or selfishness you would expect. I was very impressed that teammates and opponents alike recognized her great efforts. I highly recommend for young and old alike. My grandchildren liked the story as much as I did. I am very pleased for them to see such a good person to inspire them in their future endeavors. Very inspirational for me too. Such a great work ethic still. Definitely a documentary I will recommend to all of my friends.,False
4,10,HER STORY IS AN INSPIRATION TO ALL,faithblingpink,n/a,16/08/2025,"I Bought it!!! Loved it!!! I was inspired by it!! AND I even kept my 12 year old kid up past his bedtime for that much needed motivation to stay humble!!! To have a strong work ethic!!! To keep the faith!!! AND to know ""It's not about success but about significance!"" You don't have to be a basketball fan to LOVE THIS STORY but you'll definitely be a Jackie Stiles fan after you view it. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Anyone from Kansas to Missouri needs to see this because she a local hometown hero AND put SMS (now MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY) on the map! Small town girl to WNBA with so many awards but still with all the attention and fame she's still so humble. It's one that I'll be able to watch over and over and also have my son watch it to keep him focused; and encourages him to focus on the win and not the shots but most importantly to be a team player!",False
5,10,What a person...,derickcrooms,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a follower of the Women's game I'm surprised I never knew her story. The producers did an amazing job telling it in this doc, along with her own words, as well. The coaches, family, and friends who share their perspectives are nice also.From a production standpoint, I love how the filmmakers seem to strike the right balance in tone and tempo in how they present her story without spending too much time in one area.Jackie is a living example that, despite what is oftentimes said, you CAN be the best at your craft WITHOUT belittling others around you. She truly deserves every accolade that's come her way! #Matthew23:11.",False
6,n/a,The most inspiring documentary i've ever seen,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Jackie Stiles documentary was superb. One of the most inspiring bios I have ever seen! I'm not even a basketball fan and I loved every minute of this film! I never even heard of Jackie Stiles and walked out being a HUGE fan! This is a testimonial of discipline, dedication, and perseverance that catapulted this young girl to the top. The BEST basketball player ever. BAR NONE! Lebron wishes he could play like she did!! I've never seen a work ethic like Jackie possessed. A bitter sweet story of success and heartache, and how powerful we truly can become. A rare look into an extraordinary example of how we are all capable of manifesting our reality! This documentary should be in every elementary school as well as all schools!! It will inspire and teach how hard work and, focus,and the power of believing, can take you anywhere you want to go! Excellent resourcing and editing brought this story to life, it was truly amazing!! I give it an AA PLUS!!!!",False

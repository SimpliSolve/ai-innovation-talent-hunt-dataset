1,8,Recommended!!,Cyns-Corner,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a great documentary! You don't have to be a huge lover of music to enjoy this film. I do love movies, so this was of instant interest to me, and I'm so glad I was able to see this. It covers Williams' life and his vast career. Something that struck me was that I knew John Williams' music before I even knew John Williams! That's how immense his reach is, how broad his range across films of multiple genres. There were interviews by several well-known people including Stephen Spielberg, Chris Martin, and many others. A lot of behind the scenes moments are shown as well as many times where Williams himself talks about his various experiences (some challenging, some heartbreaking). This is a fascinating and touching look at the man and his decades of musical talent. Video review to come shortly.",False
2,9,He maps the human heart with music...,Njs2016,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a wonderful film. It isn't so much a documentary more a celebration of the music, life and humanity of John Williams. The celebration doesn't dwell on biography or deep musicological analysis but rather gives a guide to how this artist has for decades captured the essence of story, the heart of emotion in music.The excerpts of him conducting in the scoring sessions are wonderful, and throughout what comes through is his joy and his love in making music and moreover enabling others to make music. There is something truly humbling about seeing the partnership between Williams and Spielberg, they speak with one united voice. Spielberg in his imagery and narrative and Williams in music and emotional core. They also clearly adore each other and to see two artists who have such a deep personal and professional bond is wonderful to watch documented.I do wish this had been longer, a deeper dive I go his work and his process - but that is just greed! This is as good a celebration of the man as you will watch and makes you want to re-watch some movies just to hear those scores in their entirety.The film made me think about joy so much. The joy the music brings as Chris Martin says 'nobody had a bad day because they listened to a piece by John Williams' and what a legacy that is to leave to the world.We all have our favourite scores. Mine are the final Star Wars with the magnificent finale revelling in all those themes, and I have some that pop up fleetingly here like his work on Hook, which is always worth revisiting, a flawed film but an almost perfect score.For me, Williams is up there with Mozart, as being a composer who understands instinctively our emotional response to a story, but more than that here his musical work goes beyond 'the brief' and has often lifted a movie above and beyond what it may have been without him.He also genuinely comes across as a lovely man who cares deeply for his craft and for music, he has been and continues to be an inspiration not just for musicians and composers but for all of us who treasure creativity, craft and care.A brilliant celebration.",False
3,9,Reminder that craft and imagination is central to what humans can achieve,MaccaMagic,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was inspired by this documentary. We shouldn't be too quick to invite AI into our lives. We should marvel at human skill, creativity and recognise that craft takes time and unlocks so much. AI is not special, what people can achieve with imagination and experiences is.I found this film entertaining and insightful and validated what I fear. Human craft is at risk with further progression of technology.I loved the journey down memory lane of great films and tv, and the music that added so much inspired emotion. Took me back to so many great childhood memories, but also motivated me to revisit pieces I haven't seen for a long time, and others I've never seen.Amazed at how wide John Williams resume spans, and feel privileged to have been invited to know more about his life and family and those that have worked alongside him and how in awe they have all been of him.So glad I watched this.",False
4,10,"Fantastic, but wish there was more.",richard-crowley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like most of us, I have loved John Williams music since being aware of it in the original Star Wars. I also spend many hours listening to the soundtrack with headphones on, while holding the album cover.I loved this documentary, but it felt like it was scratching the surface of such a brilliant man's work, I wish it was a multi-part 90 minute series (similar to the recent Beatles documentary) with each film/episode being focused on his early life, work and then each decade of work from the 70's onwards. I could devour hearing about his process and work for hours and hours. Maybe Disney will release an extended version in the future from cut footage.Thank you sir for bringing so much joy to our lives.",False
5,8,A Glorious Homage! Great!,DLochner,n/a,16/08/2025,"Music by John Williams offers an engrossing dive into the life and legacy of John Williams, a composer whose scores have defined cinematic moments for generations. Directed by Laurent Bouzereau, the documentary pays detailed homage to Williams, following his career from his jazz-infused youth through his classical triumphs in Hollywood. Archival footage, intimate interviews, and firsthand accounts from luminaries like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas underscore the deep trust directors place in Williams to elevate their films through music. Spielberg recounts their 50-year collaboration with warmth, illuminating how Williams shaped Jaws, E. T., and Star Wars with his distinct style and emotional insight.Beyond just a career retrospective, the film reveals Williams' enduring dedication to his craft, showing him still composing by hand-eschewing digital tools in favor of the traditional pen-and-paper approach. Notably, interviews with fellow musicians, including Yo-Yo Ma and Gustavo Dudamel, highlight Williams' unique musical methodology and his influence on contemporary film scoring. The documentary captures Williams not only as a master of melody but as a creative force who has transformed orchestral film music into an emotional experience for viewers.This documentary appeals to both longtime fans and newcomers, showcasing the depth, humanity, and meticulous artistry Williams brings to every composition. Bouzereau's intimate direction and deep respect for Williams make Music by John Williams more than a celebration; it's a heartfelt tribute to the man whose scores have truly become the soundtrack of our lives""",False
6,9,A tribute to an amazing genius,dlmiley,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this film as the first red carpet event of the AFI film festival of 2024. Introduced by Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard, who produced the film, they expressed their devotion and dedication to John Williams. John Williams certainly deserves that dedication - filmgoers and music lovers will definitely agree with Messrs. Howard and Spielberg. The documentary details how Williams got his start in the film industry as well as his personal life which had a tragedy that I was not aware of until seeing this film. We learn how Williams came up with the score to films such as ""Jaws"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Star Wars"" and many others. There are also funny anecdotes of Spielberg's initial reaction to Williams' score of ""Jaws"" and Spielberg's quip about Williams' composing the score to ""Schindler's List"", which adds a bit of levity to otherwise emotionally devasting story. I also learned about the Boston Pops musicians' snobbish reactions to Williams' direction as well as many more interesting facts about this absolute musical genius. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in filmmaking as well as music.",False
7,10,A masterpiece about a true legend!,nikostsoup,n/a,16/08/2025,"A true masterpiece about the life and extrordinary work of a true legend, one of the very few of his kind still alive today. This documentary was so well made that even if it was 7 hours long it would still not be enough to honor all the incredible work the great maestro John Williams has done over so many decades on so many films. This world would not have been the same without the music that he has wrote over the years. Our parents grew up listening to it and so did we and I hope that the next generations will keep John's music to their heart. People like John Williams are great examples of talent and humanity and I hope that he is in good health and mind to keep up the amazing work, so that he receives more Oscar nominations. I wish the same for the people behind this documentary to get this to the Oscars 'cause a film about one of the people with the most Oscar nominations in the world, clearly would be Oscar-worthy.",False
8,n/a,A Heartfelt Tribute To The Greatest Film Composer Of All Time,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Chronicling the life & career of inarguably the greatest film composer alive today, Music by John Williams is crafted with heart, soul & admiration and celebrates the decades spanning legacy of the artist whose memorable compositions over the years have left an indelible mark on both film & pop culture. More a tribute than an in-depth sketch of his personal & professional life, Laurent Bouzereau's documentary provides a glance into the ideas & incidents that inspired his greatest scores, his collaboration with Steven Spielberg & endeavours outside the film industry but it isn't as informative as I expected and fails to offer any new insights.Brought to screen through interviews, behind-the-scenes footage & film clips, the documentary observes the significant impact his orchestral scores had then n now and garnered him a whole generation of fans all over the world. Perhaps, the only thing I can complain about is that it isn't long enough, for I would've enjoyed many more hours of it. Also, for no valid reason, there is too much Chris Martin in it. Nevertheless, anyone not aware of Williams' contribution to the medium is in for a treat as they finally learn about just how many iconic themes this legendary maestro has graced us with and how vast & versatile his body of work throughout the decades has been.",False
9,7,The Maestro,Fluke_Skywalker,n/a,16/08/2025,"You know the music. We all know the music. But do you know the man? ""Music by John Williams"" endeavors to tell that story. Does it succeed? Kinda.""Music by John Williams"" is somehow both overindulgent and thimble deep. Playing like a patchwork of DVD extra features, it ultimately becomes a nearly two hour gush-fest about the undeniable greatness of Williams and the cultural impact of his iconic work. As a lifelong fan of his, I've heard many of the anecdotes repeated here multiple times before. And as for the man himself, I didn't walk away from this feeling as if I had a deeper understanding of him, which seemed to be at least half the point of it all.In my opinion, John Williams is not only the greatest film composer of all-time, I'd argue he's the most important musical figure of the 20th century. No artist--not The Beetles, Elvis or Michael Jackson--moved souls and ignited imaginations the way Williams and his music have. The movies of Lucas, Spielberg and others simply don't work without his genius. They may be the engine, but Williams is the fuel.If you love the music of John Williams, you'll no doubt be moved by the well worn anecdotes here. Not unlike when you get together with old friends and recount the same stories you've heard time and time again.",False
10,10,The composer of my childhood and beyond,justwright-35606,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was 12 minutes into this documentary when I knew I was going to love it. I was an early collector of movie scores, and the composer whose work most filled my shelves was always John Williams. I was the nerd that played his scores while doing my homework. The first time I heard the Jurassic Park score I was in love with his work, though perhaps even before then, of course.This documentary is a love letter to a man so brilliant and great that you just can't believe how humble he is. His entire career is showcased here, as well as personal struggles I didn't even know about!Of course, I spent too much time on Amazon buying some of his earlier jazz albums because I didn't even know that's how he truly got his start.This documentary is a longtime coming. It's about time this man got the showcase he deserves in this format. The best night of my life was when I was lucky to get a ticket to watch John Williams conduct his music with the Seattle Symphony. Act 1 was phenomenal, but when he started Act 2 with ""Theme from Jaws"" and then welcomed Steven Spielberg onto the stage, an outstanding night got that much better. This documentary took me back to that amazing night, but it also brought me more of an understanding of the man and his music that I love SO much!",False
11,6,"A well-earned celebration, but Williams still deserves better.",Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't want to be too much of a downer, because this is a nice documentary. It functions well as a tribute to someone who's been praised to the moon and back approximately 683 times, and probably deserves another 683 trips of praise. Actually, maybe we should just praise John Williams to one of Jupiter's moons and back. Would that be more praise? The guy deserves it, in any event.Music by John Williams also scores points for celebrating Williams while he's still with us. A) it means we get to hear interviews from the guy, and B) it doesn't create any icky or exploitative effect, where someone who's passed away seemingly gets more tributes and documentaries about them pumped out because their name is going to be trending for a while. I work for a website that really pumps out articles following a high-profile person's death. I don't like writing them myself. I do, above all else, try to celebrate people who are still living legends, not even because I think they'll read what I say, but just because it feels more sincere to any other readers (hopefully) or me when you're not just eulogizing. In life, we have to have more respect for the living than the dead. People's beliefs differ on what comes after death, and I respect that, but people have to know what they mean to you - be it good or bad - while they're still here.I don't know. There's some rambling. As for the technical qualities here, it's all just very ho-hum, put together with just enough care, but not anything that makes things sing. I'm reminded of the much more thrilling Ennio Morricone documentary from 2021, just called Ennio, which presented a more compelling case for Morricone being a legend of a composer. I don't know if Morricone truly achieved more than Williams, if we're comparing them (they're both amazing, for the record), but Ennio (2021) presented the life story better.Also, some additions to Music by John Williams really drag it down. You're reminded it's a piece of Disney+ content when Kathleen Kennedy gets to call herself a filmmaker, via a title, when she's interviewed. And all the time spent interviewing Chris Martin from Coldplay was kind of weird... Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill were busy, I guess?",False
12,10,A great documentary!,djrmc24,n/a,16/08/2025,"Music by John Williams is a terrific documentary about the greatest music composer who has ever lived. Think about the most legendary music for a film and it will be from John Williams. From Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Superman, Jurrasic Park, Home Alone, etc, the list goes on. John Williams has made memorable music for all of his life and we should all be greatful to have had the chance to listen to it. This documentary really does a good job of showing where John came from and the journey he traveled to get where he is today. I really enjoyed this documentary a lot and it's one for the whole family. Music by John Williams gets a perfect 10 stars out of 10.",False
13,7,Music by John Williams,henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Straight forward but well crafted and affectionate look at the life and music of Williams, arguably the greatest film music composer ever. Whilst at no point do any of the film making and musical luminaries do anything other than gush at his talent and what a nice, hard working guy he is, this does in fact seem justified.He clearly works flat out, he adores composing and revels in different types of films so he can try and match his music to them - there is even a suggestion that he's not overly interested in films per se, just as a prompt to create. As you go through the film though, he does seem genuinely sweet, intelligent, giving and grateful and I would also think most will be surprised how much he has written - it's not all Spielberg / Lucas films. Worth catching.",False
14,5,"Great composer, average film",Groblini,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wonder if the great reviews this film is getting are reviews for the film itself or for the composer? John Williams is obviously a 10/10 composer. But is this a 10/10 documentary? No.If you are already into film and film music and have taken an interest in the work of Williams then there is nothing new here. The same anecdotes are trotted out, Spielberg hearing Jaws for the first time, Williams saying Schindler's List needed a better composer and Spielberg's response, etc etc.The only thing new I learned from this film is that John Williams' son is the lead singer of Toto.I suppose it's difficult to make an interesting documentary about someone who is so good at what they do that everyone who talks about them does so with awe and wonder. It really is extraordinary that one person has produced such a consistently impressive body of work, but a whole film where people have little to say other than ""listen to how great he is!"" with boyish excitement gets boring fast.The choice of interviewees was also a bit off. They had the important ones, but then gave too much screen time to Chris Martin and Seth MacFarlane, whose participation seemed a little unnecessary. When I saw Thomas Newman I hoped to hear more from him. Insight into some of his favourite parts from Williams scores perhaps? No, just more awe.If you don't already know that John Williams is a titan in the creative arts and has been more influential in the collective consciousness than most other people alive then you might get something out of this. If can already name more than 10 Williams scores off the top of your head right now, then you probably won't. Just go and listen to those scores instead.",False
15,10,Music to My Ears,dvlbr,n/a,16/08/2025,"This feels like it was made just for me. I cannot describe how happy I am after watching it. Not only it was educational and learnt lots of things I didn't know about the maestro, but it was so damn emotional and almost revealing, reminding me who is the greatest composer of all time.It was great to see all of the directors talking about Mr. Williams and music in general; it was seeing your friends after a long time. But it was so special to hear them talk about music and the crucial role it plays in film. That was, if I may, music to my ears. When you talk about Mr. Williams you talk about music.I feel like, after watching this, I can't stop listening to his scores. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. John Williams is the history of cinema.",False
16,10,A Masterclass in Cinematic Music.,JasonR8844,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Masterclass in Cinematic MusicThis documentary is a captivating tribute to a true musical titan, John Williams. His iconic scores have not only elevated countless films but have also become synonymous with cinematic excellence.What sets this film apart is its ability to delve into Williams' personal journey, revealing the serendipitous encounters and unwavering dedication that led to his extraordinary career. It's a fascinating exploration of his creative process and the collaborative relationships he forged with some of the greatest filmmakers of all time.The documentary's thoughtful curation of Williams' most memorable scores, combined with insightful interviews and archival footage, offers a truly immersive experience. It's a must-watch for any film lover and a testament to the enduring power of music in cinema.A perfect 10/10.",False
17,10,A Wonderful Tribute To A Master And His Medium,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"John Williams is to film music what John Madden was to NFL football or John Wooden was to college basketball. A figure who not only masters the craft, but makes it accessible to the widest possible audience. That's what director Laurent Bouzereau really taps into with Music By John Williams.For a very basic overview, this doc covers all aspects of Williams' doings in the music business, focusing specifically of course on his massive catalog of hit film scores. But his childhood, toils in ""studio Hollywood"", general musicianship, and personal life are also covered. Figures such as Ron Howard, Steven Spielberg, Seth MacFarlane, J. J. Abrams, Kate Capshaw, Chris Columbus, James Mangold, George Lucas, & Alan Silvestri (to name just a few!) also provide interview snippet insights on how/why Williams has become so iconic.One could easily have made this a ""hit parade"" of the famous Williams scores and garnered at least decent praise, and those tunes are certainly present here. From Jaws up through Harry Potter (and everything in between & after!), viewers will hear selections from the scores they love.But Bouzereau digs deeper here-and to great effect-not just leaning on the hits. Instead, we see the personality of John Williams really come out. It is an absolute joy seeing him plink around on a piano, or immediately reconnect with Spielberg and banter like it was the mid-1970s again! One can clearly see why this man has worked in Hollywood for 6+ decades, as he possesses top-of-the-line musicianship with the personality to make others feel at ease and included.It was also interesting to hear how Williams' pre-Spielberg collabs set him up for future icon status. Not only was he an accomplished jazz composer, but he worked on countless film/TV scores in Hollywood's ""studio era"" (1950s/1960s). I had no idea that orchestral scores for film/TV had nearly gone extinct between the Williams/Spielberg pairing almost single-handedly brought them back to the forefront of cinema!Much like the Madden or Wooden figures I mentioned previously, cinephiles' entire conception of the medium would be different were it not for the brilliance of John Williams. Scores for films will be composed long into the future, but he is truly one-of-a-kind and this doc captures that in every possible way.",False
18,10,A feel-good look back on the life Maestro John Williams,limelight-studios,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this doc with a smile on my face the whole time. You know each piece of music the second you hear it and it transports you to each scene of your favourite movies.I was surprised to learn more about his extensive body of work. He has touched the lives of all of us through his film scores and beyond.Some of the best scenes were the dialogue between him and Steven Spielberg. What a dynamic duo. They compliment each other in every way to make beautiful cinema.An untouchable legend we should be thankful for. I don't know if we'll ever have another John Williams. Such a great documentary! If you love movies, you'll love this film.",False
19,7,A wonderful little ode to a master,eddie_baggins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Currently 92 years of age and still actively involved in his career he has dedicated much of his life too, there's really no understating how much of an influence legendary musician/composer John Williams has had on not only the movie/music industry but all our lives over the years, whether we know it or not.Nominated across his working life for an astonishing 54 Academy Awards (that's not a typo), Laurent Bouzereau's rose-tinted glasses look at Williams in the Disney+ released Music by John Williams is a lovely reminder to us all just how lucky we are to have been passengers to Williams works that have spanned multiple decades and enhanced our lives and those that he was making music for in the cinematic landscape.Employing a range of Williams close working companions and friends to help him that includes Hollywood heavyweights such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Ron Howard, plus a range of other well-known experts and industry icons, Bouzereau is clearly a big of a fan of Williams as anyone, meaning this is a one note approach to exploring Williams life but there's no harm in that when the evidence on display speaks for itself.From the uncomplicated mastery of dread in Jaws, the cinema-changing sounds of the original Star Wars, the adventure seeking thrills of Indiana Jones through to the giving of life to long lost dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, one could spend countless hours delving into the genius of what Williams has created across his unforgettable career so what Bouzereau crams into his 100 minute doco is no easy feat and covers about as much as you could ever want to be transported into the world of a once in a life time talent.Gifting us a chance to slow down and appreciate all that Williams has done for us, the wider cinematic landscape and the characters and worlds his helped bring to life across his time is something that Bouzereau should be commended for as while we all know of Williams mastery of his craft too some level, this documentary allows us to really contemplate what a life without Williams would have looked like.At various times throughout this feel-good doco there are scenes from famous movies Williams have scored, played with and without his musical cues, themes and motifs and each one of these segments showcases what a world looks like that doesn't include the life Williams has sprung into existence and its a sad and sorry world we can be thankful we never had to endure thanks to the heartfelt works of a once in a generational talent.Final Say -While there's nothing ground-breaking about the way in which this documentary is done there's no denying that this joyous ode to an icon is a must-watch for diehard and casual fans alike, all who have been influenced or inspired to some level by the works of the one and only John Williams.3 1/2 lightsaber wielding conductors out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",False
20,10,The greatest music composer of all time,jared-25331,n/a,16/08/2025,"Music by John Williams (2024) is a phenomenal documentary movie about John Williams, the greatest music composer of all time. It was so wonderful to see the life of John Williams and how he was able to get into the music and movie industrial. Just listening to the musical scores he's composed in his legendary career was so special, it made me feel like a kid and it reminded me why I love the art of filmmaking and cinema. The interviews with several people in the filmmaking was great. It was also cool to learn about how he got or was told to do music for certain movies was very delightful.Overall, if you're a fan of John Williams and his music, then I highly recommend this documentary movie.",False
21,6,Everybody must see this!,moritzherz,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you think about the greatest musician of all time, there is no doubt that it is John Williams. And this documentary film shows exactly why.This man did not just compose the greatest and famost film music of all time (Star Wars), but also did Jaws, Harry Potter, E. T., Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Schindler's List, Superman, etc., etc., etc....If you play one of his tunes to people around the globe, people that speak different languages and have completely different culture, I can assure you, they will know the film. Neither Michael Jackson, nor Queen, not even The Beatles have achieved such recognition.So this movie is perfect for everybody. If you are new to film music, this is obligatory to understand what film music is.

22,9,A top class homage to a Music Maestro,madanmarwah,n/a,16/08/2025,"What can one say about a music composer who has provided music for iconic movies like Jaws, Jurassic Park, Harry Potter movies, ET, Raiders movies, Home Alone, Schindler's list, Saving Private Ryan and many many more.This documentary is for the hard core movie buff who understands and appreciates the role of backgound music in motion pictures. It chronicles the life and work of music Maestro John Williams who has provided music for many movies of different genres over the last 70 years or so. Now in his 90s with a large number of nominations/ awards to his credit, his work remains unparalleled. Whether it is the neoromanticism or the leitmotif or the 2 note ostinato in his music he had the power to reach the hearts of the average audience making the film director's job easier in the process. We get a good exposure of his work and thoughts through interviews. Director Steven Spielberg who has collaborated with him in around two dozen movies gives insights into various occasions of their work together.Someone has rightly mentioned that the background score of a movie represents half the movie. The BGM truly supplements the acting on the screen and brings out emotions to amuse, enthrall, excite or move the audience. A movie without BGM is bound to fall flat. Can we transmit the ominous danger of "" Jaws"" or the pathos of "" Saving Private Ryan "" or the emotions of ""ET"" without the mesmerizing musical score of legendary music composer John Williams. In an awards function actor Christopher Reeve famously said that he couldn't have flown as Superman if John Williams had not provided music. John is reported to have said that ""music is enough for a lifetime but one lifetime is not enough for music"". He also said that music to him is as essential as breathing.",False

Man, I had no idea the number of movies that he's done the score for. I knew the famous ones, of course, but there are so many more famous ones that aren't famous ... if you know what I mean.That night of movie music at the Hollywood Bowl looks absolutely magical. That's in the bucket list.I doubt I'll get to this bucket list item though because getting to Hollywood is very expensive and getting tickets is also very expensive and I'm only waffling on about this to get the word count above the minimum that is stupidly required.67/100.",True
24,10,A celebration of the greatest film composer to ever do it,parksiet,n/a,16/08/2025,"John Williams is obviously and without question one of the greatest film composers to ever live, and even that feels like an understatement. This somewhat basic documentary plays like a loving tribute to a living legend, and while it never dives into the deep nitty gritty, you can't help but just sit back in awe as Williams, Spielberg, and others reflect on the creation and impact of his most memorable scores. It's less of a documentary and more of a cinematic victory lap and celebration of Williams and his greatest musical works. Personally, my favourite aspects were seeing Steven Spielberg himself fanboying over John Williams; it is staggering on a cultural level to observe how much the two of them have impacted orchestral film scores and the film industry at large, but on a personal level its also incredibly endearing. No one has provided as much joy, excitement, and wonder to the world than this man. There will never be another John Williams - I'm so lucky I got to attend one of his Hollywood Bowl concerts a few years ago (the one featured in the doc)!

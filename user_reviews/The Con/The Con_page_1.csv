1,8,A good little true crimes documentary mini-series,freddy_at_home,n/a,15/08/2025,"I liked this a lot. Each episode is a new story. Interesting seeing how these people scam and lie. You would think, that could never happened to me, but this can happen to anybody. It's absolutely worth a watch. And you will be shocked over how rude and false some people can be. I hope to see more episodes of this series in the future. Fingers crossed!8/10",False
2,8,Good watching - especially Whoopi's narration,zjxmqpghwg,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a well done series that Kay's out how people have been conned is various ways. It's very insightful and helpful for all of us to learn how seemingly intelligent con-proof people get sucked in. The variety of cons ranges from the well known ones like the college entrance one to ones like the psychics that prey on vulnerable people. The amount of money involved are also mind-boggling. People paying thousands for worthless baubles they have been told will fight curses and defeat evil illustrates the desperation of people being conned. The shows also reveal how the con artists are ultimately brought down, sadly often after the money is gone.",False
3,9,Whoppi .. Not right as the narrator,tgordon-48292,n/a,15/08/2025,Love this show. Great content. Whoppi is overly expressive as the narrator in a raspy voice. It over shadows the show. It seems more about her and her vocal vicalinflectionnflection then the story. Keith Morrison got it right in Dateline.,False
4,10,Whoopi is why I ended up watching it!,CoWinkyDink,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love all documentaries! As a matter of fact, I fell asleep watching one on a streaming app - but because I have the *continue playing* setting on, ""The Con"" came on and woke me with Whoopi's animated voice (it was time to get up, so it actually helped!). I love Whoopi - her enthusiasm and passion are motivating! I grew up watching her in movies and comedy shows so maybe my opinion is a little biased. So I kept watching out of curiosity. The facts and perspective provided by people who were actually there brought a bona fide sense of reality, but it was Whoopi's animated narration made it very fun and entertaining - I couldn't wait to watch the other episodes! The other episodes were just as entertaining and fresh! I love these kind of documentaries - crime without the violence. I don't need anymore gory murder crap in my infotainment queue! I hope there are more to be made, but if not, I'm glad I was able to enjoy the ones I watched!",False
5,4,"Show ok, the 'scam goddess' and Whoopi are an epic fail",kfarrell05-610-499590,n/a,15/08/2025,"The show is just OK, however the addition of the so called 'scam goddess' Laci Mosley for season 2 is a terrible addition. As if Whoopi narrating wasnt bad enough then they added the 'scam goddess', which almost makes the show unwatchable .",False
6,4,A tough watch for the wrong reasons,Xavier_Stone,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched the Heiress show and the voice over of Whoopi is over the top. She shouldn't be a narrator, she interjects too much and she doesn't add much to the story.
The story itself is a lesson to learn about others. However this dude is conned out of $70k, rather easily, and he has to apply for bankruptcy and has zero money. He still feels bitter, probably because he was mislead and won't see any money reimbursed.
The show itself has little production value and the constant victim statements over and over gets old fast.",True
7,2,Poor Excuse for a Documentary,chron,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is over-produced, and under-informative. There is no depth to the content. There is too much B-roll. The script for Whoopi is pretty lame - like Dad-joke stuff.Still with real documentaries from real producers and directors.",False
8,5,Why Whoopi?,amyrach-32718,n/a,15/08/2025,"While the show is interesting, Whoopi Goldberg couldn't have been a worse choice to narrate this. First of all, her voice is annoying. It's not for 'radio' so to speak. Second, this is like a true crime documentary series and she attempts to make funny, witty comments throughout. It's not funny. At all! I found myself rolling my eyes during every episode and nearly turning it off. But again, the stories are interesting, some a bit fascinating. But I wanted to watch a true crime doc, not a farse of one. Why on earth the producer of this chose to make a joke of awful things that happened to real people was in such bad taste IMO.",False
9,1,Series OK. Narrorator...NO!,deenakurdas,n/a,15/08/2025,"These stories are old, I've heard of them prior to these coming out. I have a huge issue with whoopie... I use to like her in movies, then she became a monster with an overly loud mouth on a dumb talk show... so NO! Her voice as narrative, is disgusting! DO NOT BOTHER WATCHING THIS!",False
10,1,Whoopi is a terrible narrator.,Holdout1,n/a,15/08/2025,Whoopi is a terrible narrator. Won't be watching unless you change to a new narrator.,False
11,5,Cool stories - Narration Ruins it,christyaycock-64788,n/a,15/08/2025,"The stories they choose to highlight are fascinating!! I find it amazing that intelligent and educated people still pray victim to these twisted mastermind con artists. And they are artist!! Hopefully with this insight I'll never have to fall victim to these scams. It's just Whoopis rough and scratchy voice just makes me cringe while watching. My husband couldn't stand to watch because of her voice and went into the other room. She is NOT a good voice over choice!! Was Morgan Freeman not available? He would have been 10000000 times better. Anyone would be 10000 better. Another good documentary which was a bit sickening to watch on Hulu is ""Stolen Youth - Inside the Cult at Sarah Lawerence"" total sick con man.",False
12,3,Frustrating,reymunpadilla,n/a,15/08/2025,"The series manages to drag out 20 minutes to 40-45 minute episodes again and again.And most of these cons are frankly penny ante. A woman being conned by her supposed friend of ""thousands"" of dollars. A con man posing as a doctor.And of course the music festival that was so poorly run everyone has heard about it.Part of the con is on the viewer for sitting through this. Take my advice and don't do it.The only worthwhile episode is on a man posing as a Saudi prince. Even that runs for about ten minutes too long. I kept fast forwarding.The worst person in this series is not Goldberg. The worst is the vapid talking head they have posing as a journalist in every episode who adds nothing but annoyance.",False
13,1,Whoopi Goldberg - Narration is Terrible,reneereid-60278,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Con episode is very interesting, however, 20/20 needs to discontinue using Whoopi Goldberg as a narrator. She does not have the voice for it. Very difficult to watch and listen.The Con episode is very interesting, however, 20/20 needs to discontinue using Whoopi Goldberg as a narrator.

1,10,Outstanding,marlon-sharland,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the best things I've seen. A hard hitting and truly emotional story of love, compassion and outstanding bravery - and maybe even reckless obsession. Some stories stay with you long after watching and this was truly one of those. Edge of your seat stuff from almost the beginning until the heartbreaking, inevitable end. The courage and will to do right by the people of war-torn Ukraine is truly inspirational. Although at times a harrowing watc, the selfless (although maybe in some ways selfish too) actions of these people is to be applauded. Definitely eye opening and something I will never forget.

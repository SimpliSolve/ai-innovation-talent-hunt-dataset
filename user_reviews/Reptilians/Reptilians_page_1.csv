1,2,Made me laugh more than anything,AndromedaD-4,n/a,15/08/2025,"Every time I thought the takes were as crazy as it gets, they'd say ""how could these eyewitnesses be lying?"" The editing is atrocious, the animation is... interesting, to say the least. Bigfoot mentioned multiple times. There's narration over stock footage, but silence during the animation???I was hopeful for an actual analysis of the psychology of people who believe in the reptilian conspiracy theory, and what leads people to believe in those things, but this was just a crash course in general reptilian, conspiracy theory.",False
2,1,Time to strap on your tinfoil hats...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Alrighty then, well I thought that this was actually a sci-fi movie of sorts, so imagine my surprise when it turned out to be a documentary.Now, I've seen my fair share of dubious and questionable documentaries, but ""Reptilians"" from writer and director Silas James Rowland definitely is the icing on the cake. When and if you opt to sit down to watch ""Reptilian"", you have to ensure that you are wearing your tinfoil hat a few sizes too tight.This was definitely the most laughable documentary I've seen in ages. Talk about a laughable concept conjured up to people with way too vivid imaginations and too much time on their hands. Seriously? A race of reptilian humanoids Hellbent to take over the world? I don't know whether to laugh or cry at the absurdity that people actually being this stuff.The visual effects and CGI effects in ""Reptilians"" was not particularly great. It looked and felt like something taken out of a shoddy computer game.It takes a certain type of crackpot to believe in the topic that ""Reptilians"" deals with. But they are out there, sadly so.I would not recommend you to waste 76 minutes of your life to sit down and watching ""Reptilians"". It just simply isn't worth the time or effort. Some of us suffered through this and took on for the team. You're very welcome.My rating of writer and director Silas James Rowland's 2024 documentary ""Reptilians"" lands on a one out of ten stars.",False
3,1,Straight from the Internet to you screens!,nufercorey,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTo be fair, I was unable to sit through the whole thing. The director sitting there saying he saw a ""star destroyer"" like object in the sky when he was a kid was a red flag. That's in the first few minutes, I had to turn it off after about 20 minutes because little did I know, this was about to take a very stupid turn.What I did watch was basically exactly what you'd expect to see in a conspiracy theory facebook group. A bunch of people spouting off nonsense and trying to pass it off as, in the best case, a hypothesis to explain something, and at worst, the absolute truth.What really made stop watching was a woman, who of course did not want to be identified. Her whole ""theory"" revolved around the world being exactly as old as christianity tells us, and that Adam and Eve and the whole garden of Eden thing was a factual telling of the beginning of time. Guess what, the snake in the garden of Eden? A reptilian. And the church removed books from the bible to hide from us the ""knowledge"" we need to fight the evil reptilians, who are of course, the debil.Impossible to take seriously unless you've already lost your mind.",True
4,1,Ridiculous drivel,roydo43,n/a,15/08/2025,"Right off the bat the Director sits down and says he's not a big believer in conspiracy theories and the like and doesn't scour the internet for such stories but then goes on to say he's a big fan of the paranormal and how he saw a Star Wars-like space cruiser fly over his house as a kid. ANYONE who believes in Lizard People absolutely believes in conspiracies and the associated BS that accompanies it.This is not a cheap production and time and effort has been put into this film but don't go into this thinking you'll hear rational discussion about this topic, be prepared to listen to a cavalcade of questionable/paranoid characters discussing their theories that the world government is controlled by bipedal lizards masquerading as people.UAPs
Greys
Roswell
Reptilians
Pleiadians
Shadow governments
Are all covered. It's silly paranoid and fear mongering drivel. I'm sure there is an audience somewhere for this but nothing new or insightful is presented here and appears to be cash grab capitalizing on the recent UAP conversations.",False
5,1,Terrible,terhancock,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolutely terrible documentary. There is nothing but conspiracy theories with no original though discoveries or analysis. While some of this information could be true, it is the same story as we have already heard a thousand times. All beings have the potential for good and for evil. So stating that a certain type of beings are all evil. Is just plain ridiculous and absoliterally shows the lack of understanding of how anything in the universe truly works.There is not one stitch of evidence in this documentary to back up the claims of this director. I know for a fact that the images shown of what reptilians look like is completely inaccurate. They do not have ears.",False
6,1,Who gave this guy money?,cfchicka,n/a,15/08/2025,"This ""documentary"" is more about how people can become radicalized with insane ideas so very easily. While there is so much cool information about cryptids and ufo lore around aliens. All that information was skipped over and instead turned into a fever dream about how the government is evil, and Elon musk will save us. If you like Trump you will love this because it's nonsense on a stick.Also the director does an interview in his room that's so messy they just block out the background. Like you couldn't clean your room for your movie?When you have paranoid, fear based thoughts it's best to just not listen to them!",False
7,1,Morons,cahidi,n/a,15/08/2025,"The maker of this so called documentary is the living proof of how people with the lowest IQ can still make something to watch. No matter how stupid the contents of the movie is. This so called documentary is compiled without any hard evidence, yet they're flapping their mouths so bravely. Don't they know that the world are cruel to idiots? Aren't they scared of being ridiculed for the rest of their miserable lives? Cause to be honest, I find this so called documentary much much much more stupid than the one about flat Earth. Can you imagine something more stupid than flat-Earth people? Well, you're looking at this so called documentary now. Don't fill your head with this garbage. Find something much much much better to kill your time. Even if it's free, don't watch it.",False
8,1,"Stay in school, kids.",tf-24474,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis ""documentary"" made me believe less and less in every conspiracy theory I held before. The pace is annoyingly slow, the regression and diversion from the original topic aren't well planned and the ""experts"" really need some genuine reading into the beliefs and theories they already hold.Wouldn't recommend. 70 minutes of my life I'm never getting back.It makes me sad how after how far humanity has come, there are still people out there who believe in these outlandish ideas/fantasies. Many years ago, you'd be killed for saying that the earth was a globe or that germs caused diseases. Now we let people who think the human race is so mindlessly powerless that a group of reptilian monsters are running the world to homeschool their kids!!!I won't even talk about the crazy lady's absurd theology but the moment a Christian tells you that demons are physical beings, stop listening. Or maybe this ""writer"" fella is just cashing on this recent phenomenon of bozos falling for just about any bs peddled out, hoping to line his pockets...which makes it conflicting for me on how exactly to feel about him-Moneymaking genius or just a plain sick dude.",True
9,1,A bunch of religious nuts,brainwerx-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie is basically just a bunch of southern US religious nuts talking about how the reptilians have been ruling the earth, and it says so in the bible (the talking snake thing). According to them the vatican is also complicit in it this plot, as are other various leaders.All of them are scared, pretty much defines many americans, that run around with guns, the christian extremists that are afraid of the LGBTQ++ community, women etc. Add to that the idea that evolved reptiles rule the planet and you pretty much have everything covered by these people. I can't think of anything else that they are afraid off, but I'm sure they will find something more.",True
10,1,Q-Anon crap,dmoore3024,n/a,15/08/2025,"Amazing use of stock footage, three interviewees (including the director himself) speculating wildly about reptilian people, garden of evil, baby eating, demons, giants, and more.Besides the interviews with the director and the back of the head of the poor woman who has obviously adopted all the QAnon ravings, the rest of the film is a montage of stock footage and video game style special effects.Overall a very sad revelation of how far rational thought has strayed. We watched it thinking it would be a bit tongue-in-cheek and have some fun with the reptilian conspiracy. From the description, we thought there might be some discussion about why people but in to crazy conspiracies. None of that. Just ravings and speculation. A train wreck.",False

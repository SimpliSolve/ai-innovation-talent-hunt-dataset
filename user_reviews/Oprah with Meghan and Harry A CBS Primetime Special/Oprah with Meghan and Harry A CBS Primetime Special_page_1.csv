1,5,Interesting but obviously some unkindness.,jaybug-49925,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis interview could've been so interesting and positive. Harry and Megan are likable and enduring, but when they started slinging insults toward the Royal family, it lost some thing. They don't seem to realize that when you start slamming people you are close to, it actually backfires on you. I live in the US and thought they were being unkind and immature. It was not a good interview. The whole racist accusation was unnecessary and I'm not even sure it was correct. Even if it was, one person who said something stupid?",True
2,6,"""First line of interview"" we are""Not being paid for interview""",allanmichael30,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhy do an interview with oprah ? Why sue press and then make claims in the same way the press does. ""Oprah is the press"" Wake up Harry, Harry was also not present for most of interview.
Megan , Say so many vague claims and some about rasicm, Oprah ""shocked"" because of one question on skin colour and I thought if Megans mother had asked would she be going on Oprah. It turnned out ,that was before wedding and it turns out was a private conversation with Harry and another royal and not directed to Megan in a hateful way and it was a conversation Harry and ? was either a senior Royal or an aid Maybe?
That conversation was private and it will remain private""Harry says"", but did he not relise a claim in a big interview was on T.v. and far from private.------------------------------------------------------------------------- It was only ""one member of the ROYAL FAMILY"" who said this but was not the Queen or Philip Oprah said to press and she was told that directly.-------------------------------------------------------------------------It might not have been said in a racist context, however Harry the only person their, when it was said thought it was and did'nt like it, Yet pondered said nothing and told Megan later, without challanging it at the time. Why? ------------------------------------------------------------------------They then say the ""Queen is their only friend"" they can talk to from the family and they regulally do. Then Harry says his ""father asks for letter only"" and no phone calls and he does not speak to his brother either. The other big claim was Megan was made to cry by a comment from kate on wedding planning and made up, I thought this has never happened before to other brides, they never get upset over small things and make up with famly again. Yawn------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Megan also said someone, a Royal aid told her not to go out with her friends for lunch because of press harassment and spent months going nowhere, but in the papper daily. It also made her depressed being a royal and suicidal which was quite sad, but expected as Diana shared similar stories of Harassment. The big deal on the night of the interview was why the security they had was being removed, who ordered this and why ?
I wondered was it only when they went to Canada or before and now they need money from Netflix to pay for security.
I thought they made the right choice, as security is need, why risk it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Megan shares her side as being told where or what she can go as being a prisoner and compared her self to Disney little mermaid and Hary said he felt like a prisoner working as a prince.-------------------------------------------------------------Harry said that's what it's like being a Royal and they did'nt want a title for Archie but claimed Race could have played a roll on him not getting a tittle, even though Queen has final say and they are talking to Queen and she is no racist. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Its been dificult for media to remember Harry is a grown man and has right to do what's best for his family and that paying for his security is a small price for all the work he did and was good for the firm.-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can see that now they are happy without the pressure and the other Royals need to accept Megans and Harrys choice and Maybe call them to sort it out, as Harry seems like he wants to sort it out and maybe they did want their son to be a prince now. The crazy thing about all this is its been reported, Archie could automatically be prince still when charles becomes king.",True
3,5,How can you review this objectively,chrisrowexxx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well honestly I went in thinking that if anyone would create such an event in the royal family then Meghan would probably be the stereotype, being an actress and American etc. I detest social media and the ignorance to the damage it causes in the world. I watched the interview and believe that to them that was the truth, whether context or opinion may vary if everyone saw every event is irrelevant to them I believe they believe it's true.I see arguments of them being rich and influential and poor the, but there's the main divide whether race, money, any orientation that we are all people all the same and nothing else should matter. So people hating on them for being rich etc when they're poor are just as ignorant as anyone. It's well addressed the institutional racism in history when times were different but today especially it's just reprehensible.In the uk the response was typically pathetic, doing a show to look impartial but stacking it with royal fanatics and former staff that would never be objective and the only objection coming from the common people who were gogglebox style viewers. The problem is white people clearly don't fully understand how bad racism is where any mention any person of colour of this show was instantly offended, there needs to be a medium or then these wars will keep happening, people have to be understanding, more objective and just better. I hate that race and mental health is used and abused to excuse behaviour or blind people from bad behaviour etc.I felt sad for Harry but I didn't like Meghan, I didn't feel a warmth or introspective attitude that showed her anything than other as a victim with no wrong doing, most events no matter what you hear, it's rarely ever one totally wrong, there's always blame on both sides in some way.The royal family is dated and in my view I hate one comment more than us by one pompous guy, that the security issue, that uk tax payers would not want to fund security for an ex royal, not being funny we don't want to fund any of them, their renovations on elaborate properties and various other things. It's ridiculous, he deserves support as he's a target due to how he was born, they should pay, tax payers should not pay for any of them, if they're not self sufficient it should end, simple as that.This world has no privacy, less respect, worse people, stupider people, more opinionated, ignorant and entitled based on nothing other than social media power. Scrap social media and rebuild future generations with actual social skills, the worlds slowly regressing in quality as technology takes over, people seem worse now than ever and people need to take responsibility and be accountable.Stop airing stuff and just be better, these conversations need to end eventually and everyone should realise were all the same and the worlds hard enough without people hating for no reason, love as one be as one, end classes, race wars, sexism and just love people, hate for valid reasons or actions is ok. But hate based on ignorant idiotic views needs to die. I hope the royal family release a better statement and actually adapt and change their outdated, fake fuddy duddy ways. They may do a lot of good. But there's to much segregation and silence around important views, if tax funds them clarity is owed.",False
4,1,Staged,tradestarz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This interview seemed staged and practiced ahead of time. It seemed exaggerated and full of untruths. It was as if Harry and Meaghan had an ax to grind against royal family just because they didn't get their way. Oprah did a terrible job as an interviewer. She didn't challenge their ludicrous claims or seek clarification to support their accusations. It was a very one sided and unfair attack on the royal family. It was full of lies, contradictions, and hypocrisy. Harry and Meaghan are really good at playing the victim and playing the race card. This interview was a bad joke. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this garbage.",False
5,8,Better than most tv shows out there.,PeteB123,n/a,16/08/2025,"That was really entertaining. I even forgot to watch The Walking Dead. It was sort of like watching a two hour train wreck.
Storyline: Harry brings divorced black Los Angeles soap opera actress home to meet his ultra-conservative British royalty family. What could possibly go wrong?",False
6,7,Oprah with Meghan and Harry: A CBS Primetime Special,studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whatever your viewpoint on this after it had ended, this remains one of the most engaging and talked about programmes of 2021.Up there with Princess Diana's Panorama interview in terms of scandal.",False
7,8,Money grabbing Royals?,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"I will try and give a balanced opinion on this interview, as a Brit that loves The Royal family, it felt, beforehand like it was going to be a hatchet job. I will start by saying she has been treated shockingly by The Media, when you read some of the articles about her, they are abhorrent, take a minute, and look back.Some of the racist trolling is sickening, something needs to change, people cannot be allowed to hide behind an online profile and spill out vile, racist bile.I have to get this out, the hypocrisy has irritated many people, for a couple that wanted to escape, be self sufficient, and get away from the Media???? Do they think the Public are stupid, a Netflix series, and an explosive interview like this one..... It's insincere, please just be honest with us.If you think you know all the answers, good for you, I am as confused about the couple after seeing this as I was before. I see a couple that want to escape the expectations of Royal Life, and get on with their lives, I just question whether Meghan was naive to not know what she was getting into, that's one thing I find difficult to take in.The couple were expecting The British taxpayer to pay for security for them to live a life of luxury, at a time where many Brits face losing their jobs through Covid, that doesn't sit well.Let's just remember, all families fall out, this one just happens to be The Royal family. It's perhaps time for all parties to look to the future, move on, and hopefully quieten Piers Morgan down a bit. Maybe one day there will be some sort of reconciliation, when you think what Harry and William suffered with their mum, it saddens me that this has reached this stage.I'm sure there will be experts all over this interview, discussing body language and what was said and how. This will be news for weeks to come.Acting, two with acting skills, one without, it's not difficult to spot which one isn't an actor here.I liked how Harry spoke about his Grandmother, she is a remarkable, incredible woman, one I have absolute respect for.Overall, a good job from Oprah, but just remember there's another side to this story. 8/10.",False
8,7,RESPECT HARRY & MEGHAN!!!,nikolasbraniotis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah was a powerful moment of truth, exposing the harsh realities they faced within the royal family. With grace and honesty, Meghan revealed the emotional toll of relentless media attacks and lack of support from the institution, even when she struggled with her mental health. Harry's decision to step away wasn't betrayal-it was an act of love and protection. Yet, instead of acknowledging their pain, critics dismissed them, defending a system that resists accountability. Their story is one of resilience against an outdated institution unwilling to evolve. This interview wasn't an attack-it was a necessary stand for truth, justice, and the right to live freely.",False
9,1,Two Multi-Millionaires Complain to a Billinaire,reneecschmitt,n/a,16/08/2025,"A waste of 2 plus hours watching this complain session by Harry and his wife - Very disappointed in Oprah who made her fortune off the back of middle-aged ""White"" women use her platform to promote victimhood and in order for Harry's wife to trash her husbands family by using the ""Race Card"" with no receipts -This so called ""interview"" showcases Harry and his wife along with Oprah's vindictiveness towards the Royal Family and the people of UK and the Commonwealth -Fast forward - this smear campaign has made the RF more popular and these three popularity decrease.",False
10,10,Outstanding,tanyashawander,n/a,16/08/2025,Oprah thank you for providing a safe place for Harry and Meghan.I watched several times. Thank yo.,False
11,2,Self Pitying Dross from 2 Very Priviliged People,Film_Love4,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen even the Archbishop of Canterbury himself contradicts one of the lies told in this interview, you have to wonder whether Oprah even bothered to employ researchers.When multi millionaire Prince Harry began whining about how Daddy cut him off, I sailed over the edge. I can't believe somebody of Oprah Winfrey's standing lowered herself to this nonsense. Not only did she facilitate it, she actually pandered to it. A complete embarrassment all round, nobody came out of it looking good.",True
12,1,"Awful , hurtful interview full of unsubstantiated allegations",marilyngroves,n/a,16/08/2025,I watched this shocked and horrified at the unchallenged allegations in this interview.Oprah Winfrey or maybe her staff didn't do their homework before releasing this load of hurtful tripe.No respect for Oprah at all now.,False
13,8,Too many VICIOUS reviews!,eb999,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was impressed by both Meghan and Harry's intelligence and charm and give this show an 8 (which would be my highest number for this kind of show). However, the main reason I'm writing this review is to question the provenance of all the vicious one's and two's given by other reviewers. Considering the content of the interviews which included some negative feelings expressed toward the Royal ""business"", I would bet that these sickening reviews were perpetrated by this institution! With a lot of money, I'd guess it would be easy to obtain reviewers willing to create this type of Insulting garbage!",False
14,1,"Lots of one sided interviewing and open mouthed reactions, no fact checking",sross-70677,n/a,16/08/2025,Lost a lot of respect for Oprah after this one. Lots all my respect for Harry's Wife. Lost any sense of hope or respect for Harry. Felt really bad for The Royal Family after this one.,False
15,10,Brave...,applegrrls,n/a,16/08/2025,"I legitimately feel empathy for all parties involved because it truly can't be easy for any of them. And it's especially hard for anyone who, like his Mother, dares break the enchanted spell by telling the world royal life isn't really a dream. Even with all we know about royal life these days, I truly doubt any of us would be prepared for the excruciating public or private scrutiny. And the brutal pr against Meghan & Harry began nearly the moment that they met, and then only infinitely intensified upon leaving. Anytime anyone speaks truth to power I personally find it brave because in that very moment, they are risking everything. They stand together, loving hands clasped, souls intertwined & deeply in love. They are also brave enough to be honest with themselves, and each other, as they stand united against the royal facade. I'm neither anti nor pro royal because I'm not a royal. But any monarchy that truly does not rule, they are but powerless institutions whose only power is the appearance of power. Not a judgment. I'm not going to trash anyone like i personally know everything. But what is clear? Their pain is truth. And so is their families. The cost is high in pain for everyone. Sometimes we might lose a lot, but in my eyes, you're brave when you do what's right, and sometimes that's right thing is knowing the moment when its time to walk away. I find their love & philanthropy inspiring. But I still hope everyone remembers life is short, and they put the pain behind them & mend fences the best they can. And that goes double for anyone slinging hate at any of the them too.",False
16,1,A complete farce,aahl,n/a,16/08/2025,"Since the airing of this ""interview"" the majority of ""their"" truth have been proven to have been mistruths. It was cringeworthy to watch and had many inconsistences which where ignored by Oprah. Oprah has lost credibility.",False
17,9,MISSING INTERVIEW,sonjaelaine75,n/a,16/08/2025,Looks like the interview is not on CBS. More silencing of them. Sad the royal family cannot actually behave like decent people. The queen is horrible for all of this and whomever goes along with it is just as wrong!,False
18,1,Many claims proven false weeks later,sross-70677,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lost a lot of respect for Oprah after this ""program"". Lost all my respect for Harry's Wife. Lost any sense of hope or respect for Harry. Felt really bad for The Royal Family after this one.",False
19,1,Pity Party,savoera-86991,n/a,16/08/2025,Don't really want to waste anymore words on this. Why on earth did Harry support his wife in maligning his own family? A family he supposedly loves! Airing out their dirty laundry on such a public platform... not classy.,False
20,10,Scandalous,wczwdnmm,n/a,16/08/2025,A great chat to expose the abuse that goes on behind closed doors with the firm. They have to change their ways. I couldn't pick up my jaw which was on the floor the whole time. I enjoyed every minute of it. One of the top scandals of the 21st century. I don't blame them for leave after watching this .. thanks Lady O.,False
21,1,Absolutely garbage. Biased and untruthful,benford-11742,n/a,16/08/2025,"This has to be one of the worst interviews carried out by one of the worst interviewers America has to offer.This is not so much of an interview, rather than a very produced over exaggerated view of a couple that have no respect for the family that gave them everything.A prince who turned his back on his country. Family and commitments and a show girl who prostitute's a title give to them by a very loving grandmother and sovereign.I would not recommend watching this if you want a balanced view of the British Royal Family.",False
22,10,Meghan and Harry rise above the bullying,prettyjenna,n/a,16/08/2025,I personally loved this interview. It gave an inside look into something that we all already suspected. They told their truth and shared what they felt they needed too after constant bullying and berating by the UK tabloids and some American host. This was a much needed tell all and they are doing leaps and bounds better in the states as of right now.,False
23,1,This must damage Oprah,jdaubney,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think we all knew what nonsense would come out of the Mr and Mrs Markle, but Oprah has really damaged her reputation with this one. No longer will I watch her shows nor partake in any program of hers. I cannot believe she backed this horse full of.foolishness, baloney and.balderdash. It was nonsensical.",False
24,10,"Truthful and should have said more,",jigolov,n/a,16/08/2025,I think they were truthful. The only people who think they lied are the UK tabloids and royal sycophants who don't want to think negatively about the royal family. And third is an element of the public who are racist and also thinks Meghan isn't good enough to be a royal. Some people were biased towards Meghan before the interview because she is American and biracial. I am glad they did the interview as now there are many people now seeing that they told the truth if they didn't think so when it originally aired. The royal family needs to put a stop to the hate fest by the British media . And tell the palaces to stop the lies they are leaking to the media.,False
25,1,Is OPRAH a journalist?,bftjkjbm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oprah did not do her due diligence and let someone who has a vendetta against the RF to tell more than a dozen lies without challenging her-Harry married someone who wants fame and money more than anything and will eventually throw him into the lion den when she's done with him-everyone lives that Harry had found someone to marry; it was magical until she couldn't control her image and rise above what the media says or social media. Queen Elizabeth had done it all her life, managed to rise above and serve her life to her people -Oprah race baited and the wife enjoyed trashing the family-Harry should be ashamed -all she wants is money and the sooner people stop giving her a mouthpiece the sooner they can go live the private lives they desperately wanted -",False

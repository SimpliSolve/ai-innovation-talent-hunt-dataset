1,10,A breath of fresh air,btnjhph,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is a long film, but a fascinating one. Everyone who is female or who cares about the women in their lives should take a look. It is so interesting to hear these women speak, with their differing backgrounds and experiences. The film shines a light on what the mainstream media does not want you to hear about. Women, most agree, need their safe spaces, sports and opportunities without dilution or compromise, but there are being quietly eroded. And the treatment of women in our culture is so devalued and alienating that it's no wonder girls and women are opting out. Watch it, and make up your own mind!",False
2,10,The truth and nothing more,melissamarshall-38133,n/a,17/08/2025,"I am a woman. I am a liberal feminist. I am against fascism. I am against racism. I am against homophobia. I have watched in horror as a loud cohort of primarily heterosexual fetishists have taken over the gay community and begun to bully women and try and define them. The trans movement is at its core, highly misogynistic.This film is simple, clear and reasonable. It lays out its case with evidence and clarity. It's not a great work of art but it is a great work of rhetoric.We need to protect women's spaces. We need to protect women and children's bodies and minds. Non right wing people need to speak out because this issue could bring down the only political party that is standing between the United States and fascism. Speak up. Speak out.Every human that cares about women's rights, children's safeguarding and LGB rights should watch and share.",False
3,10,Scientific film,vjcoward,n/a,17/08/2025,"Well researched, accurate and thoughtful film. The information was delivered in a calm and helpful way that will help anyone trying to find actual scientific and balanced view on this topic. The interviews were very helpful and from a variety of contributors. I was particularly shocked by the treatment of the woman who had worked at the London Fire Brigade. Yet she was thoughtful and honest about her treatment. Many if the biological facts explained were obviously very basic but these need to reiterated in a world that increasingly sidelines biology taught across the world to everyone. This programme is a must watch.",False
4,10,Outstanding documentary. Do not be fooled by the propaganda.,chantesayers,n/a,17/08/2025,"Much has been said, incorrectly, about this excellent film.Informative, balanced, heartfelt and honest views on women and what it means to be an adult human female.There has been much misinformation and propaganda about the film which is being peddled by people who haven't actually watched it.I would invite anyone who is sceptical to watch with an open mind. Listen and think. There is no hate within this film, only compassion and emotion.A broad mix of content from a wide variety of women in many subjects affecting what womanhood means in the 21st century.Highly rated and well worth watching.",False
5,1,Absoulte Waste Honestly,singhjustin-02673,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerWe all know that a woman is an ""Adult Human Female"". But this documentary is made to justify their hate and ignorance towards transgender and the LGBTQ communities and also an insult to women as they deserve to be celebrated with freedom and their views of life instead of being forced to watch this trash that makes them hate on people and hide in their devices to spread hate towards everyone around them. I myself have respect for womens rights and I don't wish anything bad on them or anyone, but this so called documentary is not doing anybody any favours and hence why everyone is willing to take this rubbish off screen as we all have better things to focus on in life.",True

The documentary is expertly crafted, with compelling storytelling and excellent production values. The passion and sincerity of the film's creators are palpable in every frame, making it an unforgettable viewing experience. For its thought-provoking content, powerful message, and impeccable execution, ""Adult Human Female"" earns a perfect 10/10 rating.

7,10,A documentary for our times that everyone should watch,malcolm_featherstone,n/a,17/08/2025,"Clearly articulates the dangers to children's long-term health and well-being and female's hard-won rights and spaces by exposing the inconsistencies, logical flaws and plain reality denying underlying the gender identity cult being foisted upon us.Shows that the main driving forces behind the gender critical movement are courageous individuals (mostly women) who are left-leaning rather than the 'Alt-Right' commercially financed religious zealots they are often smeared as.This should be watched by everyone who is genuinely concerned about sex equality, and who want children's physical and mental well-being to be protected rather than becoming a tool for a twisted ideology to manipulate.",False
8,10,Thank you!,missmads-26241,n/a,17/08/2025,"Thank you so much for making this film. I cannot believe we're seeing a time where this film is even necessary. Everything in the film is so eloquently and intelligently put, with thought and care. It perfectly described my concerns and thoughts and those shared by the women in my family. This film has given me the courage to be more vocal on my opinions and concerns. I want everybody to watch this film with an open mind and hear women's voices! I can relate so much to the despair felt by many of the women talking, as a life long socialist and Labour voter, it feels so hard right now to see clearly a way to protect our core values and the sex based rights of women. Let's hope the tides are changing. Thank you!!",False
9,9,Gender Critical Arguments & Testimonials,Jemimaandtheholograms,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary predominantly uses interviews with left wing gender critical feminists to show the problems associated with radical gender ideology. Most of the women have been ostracized and even fired from jobs for daring to breathe their dissenting views. In an era where all the rhetoric surrounding gender is wholey one sided, radical, and unsensical, this documentary serves as a beacon of light in a dark dank cavern. These women have used the vehicle of this documentary to stand against the manipulation of our language to indoctrinate the masses into a totalitarian group think. Their resistance should be commended.",False
10,9,Why women won't & shouldn't wheest,honoro-58669,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerTalking heads piece from women who simply won't role over & be quiet when they see a problem.If you don't understand why women across the UK political spectrum are dropping their differences & banding together against Gender Identity, then this is the film for you. Clearly outlines the threat inherent with removing the concept of sex from UK legislation, and replacing it with the pseudo religious idea of gender.Everyone who has been on the fringes of the debate, or simply hasn't had the time or energy to wade into this topic can learn a lot about what has been happening on Terf Island for the last few years & why women's rights are being removed without majority consent or the main stream media fully engaging in the topic.The no debate era is over & this film is turning a well timed spotlight on the biggest issue we aren't allowed to discuss.Great viewing.",True
11,10,The film they tried to ban!,sarahspinsstories,n/a,17/08/2025,"Thoughtful and intelligent documentary on the chilling effect Gender Identity Ideology has been had on the lives & rights of women & gay men: experts sacked from their jobs, lesbians blocked from dating, women in prison menaced, work to end violence against women & girls stymied, same-sex attraction defined out of existence, ostensibly charitable organisations cheerleading & bullying people out of their jobs. A must-watch. I saw it with a group of 23 other women & there were gasps, laughter, booing (at a certain politician or too), and wild applause. Why not get together with friends & arrange a watch party so you can discuss it afterwards?",False
12,9,A serious and thought-provoking film,bronwendavies-41586,n/a,17/08/2025,"I would have liked it to have said a little more about who all the speakers were, it would have made the film more interesting for me.Having said that, I found all the women interviewed very interesting. I liked the format, where women were just shown answering a question which had been put to them off-camera: it helped me focus on what the women were saying, some of which was very powerful.For anyone wanting to understand why so many women in the UK are angry about the attempts being made to undermine sex-based rights that we had thought had been secured by the Equality Act 2010, and the sheer disrespect being shown towards women and our right to hold and express opinions, this film is essential viewing.",False
13,10,Excellent fact based film about the threat to Women's Rights,sahry-76202,n/a,17/08/2025,"I found this film interesting and informative and would recommend it.Very educated speakers on the issue of 'what is a woman?', and from a female perspective.Lots of thought provoking discussion and if you don't know about the threats of gender ideology to Women's Rights, you should definitely watch.A fairly academic discussion with some interesting viewpoints.Interestingly, I heard that a recent viewing at Edinburgh University was stopped by an aggressive male, who thought this film shouldn't be viewed.So if you like free speech and the opportunity to make up your own mind, this film is for you.",False
14,10,"excellent, clear concise outline of the issues",annascant,n/a,17/08/2025,"This was a methodical, clear analysis of some the major issues at play in the current debates over the influence of gender ideology. It shows how our establishments, laws, sports, justice,and the rights of women and girls are at risk. It shows how appropriate safeguarding and sex segregated spaces must be protected. It's a good 'primer' for people trying to get up to speed with the issues, a good start. Hopefully another will follow, giving more information on the dangers of the ideology for children, the social contagion aspects and the influence of schools.This is an important film, and the makers have insured a diverse range of voices, who are skilled at setting out what the critical issues are in straightforward language. This should be compulsory viewing for policy makers, politicians, parents, clinicians, police - everyone! It opens the floor up to debate, which has been so sorely lacking in the last decade. No longer. The issues need rigorous debate and wide discussion among the general public and this film can help to start these discussions This is a thoughtful, well researched piece without being wild or scaremongering, although it shows, sadly, that there is much for women and children to be fearful of.",False
15,10,"If you don't get women's concerns in this discussion, you need to watch. If you need a bump of validation, you should definitely watch.",qfnydghsy,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary is very to the point. There isn't much flash and pomp to it, but I think that getting to the root of the issue as quickly and straightforward as possible is the point.To those of you claiming that this is just hatred geared toward the ""LGBTQ"" community, at least half of these women are lesbians, so just stop. Stop, take a breath, and realize that you need to listen to points that you disagree with and think for yourself. This documentary is a good springboard, allowing the facts that are frequently buried and hidden to be brought to the table. If you want to be knowledgeable and 'right,' you have to at least know the opposing argument.",False
16,10,Best documentary ever bravo,telifoneline,n/a,17/08/2025,"Ten out of Ten. No not really it is a documentary by fascist extremists who are mad that they lost their jobs for spreading hate and there is no room for hate in our society
They are backed by organised religion and American extremism Christian's. This documentary is both boring and an insult to woman and real lesbians everywhere, by a small minority of dinosaurs who harass vulnerable people. They are lobbied the government to bring misery and suffering to many vulnerable people and are backed by the likes of Harry Potter author & also posse Parker and Caroline Farrow who left her home because she didn't want anymore free pizzas. The whole thing is poorly directed, the camera work is very poor and distasteful and I would rather watch royal coronation of King Charles on loop for all eternity, than to watch this documentary again. The shining was more entertaining but I have to give them some credit for this documentary, they didn't need any makeup or special FX to be scary they did a good job. I want a refund and I wouldn't even torrent this stuff it's terrible.",False

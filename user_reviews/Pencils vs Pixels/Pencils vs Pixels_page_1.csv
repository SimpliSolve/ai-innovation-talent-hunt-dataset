1,6,"Really interesting subject and amazing featured artists, but the documentary itself is not that great",weareinourprimes,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love 2D animation and i thought it was so cool to see all these truly amazing animators contribute in this. It's really interesting to hear about the transition from 2D to 3D animation from the animators themselves. I'm very impressed by the cast, which includes the creator(s) behind Gravity Falls, Klaus, Family Guy, as well as several classic Disney movies. They got so many amazing people star in this, a legend like Andreas Deja only got like 1 minute of screen time.It would have been cool to hear more from 3D filmmakers to balance it out even more. I also would've loved a more thorough introduction of the animators.The score (especially in the first half) is unfortunately incredibly bad. It was distracting at times.. I considered turning the whole thing off.An all in all an interesting documentary, that had the potential to be really great.",False
2,9,Very inspiring,russlaw-45041,n/a,16/08/2025,"A friend recommended this to me, and I have to say-it was exactly what I needed. It sparked something inside me that I hadn't felt in a while. Inspiration has this incredible way of sneaking up on you when you least expect it, and that's exactly what happened. After watching it, I picked up my iPad, opened Procreate, and just let myself go. No overthinking, no meticulous planning-just the pure fun of creation. It was liberating. I found myself sketching out a simple 40-frame animation, something raw and imperfect. Very satisfying and I'm glad I watched it.I think you should give it a go too.",False
3,4,A Real Snooze,pebsdad,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel like I've seen this before. It's clearly not new interviews and it's basically just that, a bunch of talking heads rapturously talking about what animation means to them. It even looks and feels dated.The talkers and their talking are interspersed with clips of Disney animation including a lot of hand drawn original art which is the most interesting but, again, we've seen it in countless other Disney docs. I found myself fast forwarding a couple minutes here and there to see if it gets interesting or changes the format but unfortunately it doesn't. If you give it a shot and feel like it's not your cup of tea after a couple minutes be sure it doesn't get any more flavorful.",False

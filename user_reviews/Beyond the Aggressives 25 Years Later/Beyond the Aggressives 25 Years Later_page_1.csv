1,10,Great follow-up to an important documentary,gregorybruhn,n/a,15/08/2025,"Director Daniel Peddle and the entire cast have developed an extremely worthwhile second chapter to the original documentary film, bringing the audience back into the cast's lives, struggles, and changes of the original film participants. It not only an expose of their lives and their own personal evolutions over the years, but a study in the enormous shifts in cultural understanding around gender and sexuality that have transpired over the past twenty years ago. It's a coming-of-age film (of sorts) both of the ""characters"" and of society as a whole. What resonates in the end is the plurality of voices that we've accepted into society, with more room to grow.",False

1,7,A VERY STRANGE AND UNSETTLING DOCUMENTARY,jmvscotland,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have very mixed feelings about this documentary. I thought I knew what this was going to be about but it turns that there's much more to this story than one might expect.It seems very strange to me that Ari's son Tyler appears to have been so accepting for so long of what his father does in his spare time. But it appears that, like Ari's parents and friends, Tyler lost patience and looked like pulling the pin on his relationship with his Dad.It's quite incomprehensible to me that Ari goes into these surrogate father relationships without being armed with what should be an iron-clad legal waiver of any future financial responsibility for the children that he helps these women to bring into the world. Frankly, I think it's just plain dumb to do what he's been doing for years without having that safeguard for himself and his OWN family as well as his salary from his lecturing work.There was mention of his spending upwards of half his salary on child support payments to women he trusted but who obviously turned out, quite predictably in my opinion, to be parasitic when the joy of having a child became secondary to the money that they concluded they could extract from Ari. The whole world is about money and Ari was smart enough to know what was obviously going to happen.By about half way through the documentary, I was sitting there wondering why the Hell Ari appeared to be so intent on continuing with something that was having such a profound impact on his life and especially on the relationships with his immediate family, especially his son Tyler and his parents.As in the title to this review, a strange and unsettling documentary.7/10 from me.",True

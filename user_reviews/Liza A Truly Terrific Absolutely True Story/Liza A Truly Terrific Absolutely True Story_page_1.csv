1,7,acting a song like no other,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. The list of icons known by a single name is relatively short and includes such luminaries as Elvis, Prince, Cher, Bono, Beyonce, and Sting. Immediately recognizable with only her first name, Liza Minnelli also fits right in. Documentarian Bruce David Klein has delivered a tribute to her early years as the daughter of worshipped idol Judy Garland and famed film director Vicente Minnelli, and outlines her own path to stardom after tragedy to being recognized as one of the greatest performers of all time.Liza is now 79 years old and wheelchair bound, and yet when the lights are on and the camera is rolling, her entertainer side takes over and she's charming, and a bit naughty. The death of her mother in 1969 (at age 47) was a distinct turning point in Liza's life. She says she was born and they took a picture - meaning she has spent her entire life in the spotlight ... although she makes it clear she was not born in a red sequin dress.We learn about those who have influenced her career, her life, and her style. Singled out are Kay Thompson as a mentor, Charles Aznavour who taught her performance, Fred Ebb and musical partner John Kander, Broadway legend Michael Feinstein, and famed choreographer Bob Fosse. We also learn of Liza's four marriages and divorces to Peter Allen, Jack Haley Jr, Mark Gero, and David Gest. Though Liza offers no real comment on the marriages, those interviewed are particularly harsh when discussing the late Mr. Gest.Liza's brilliance has resulted in the rare EGOT, with her Emmy and Oscar being won in the same year (""Liza with a Z"", CABARET). Not surprisingly, her outstanding performance as Sally Bowles in CABARET (1972) draws a significant portion of the commentary here, and it's stunning to hear Liza remark, ""I don't think I'm a real good singer, but I can act a song."" Her loyalty to friends is emphasized on multiple occasions - never more dramatically than when she saved the Broadway production of ""Chicago"" by substituting for Gwen Verdon.Not much time is devoted to the dark period, although her friendship with Halston (clothes and parties at Studio 54) is mentioned. Liza's half-sister Lorna Luft appears briefly, but not much personal insight is provided. Rehab for Liza is acknowledged, but let's be clear, Bruce David Klein set out to make a loving tribute to a fascinating performer, and that's exactly what this is.Opens in theaters on March 14, 2025.",False
2,7,Ebullient Albeit Incomplete Look at Liza's Iconic Life,EUyeshima,n/a,16/08/2025,"Director Bruce David Klein deserves credit for not turning this 2024 documentary into complete hagiography as Liza Minnelli's celebrity-filled personal life and dazzling career would've been easy fodder for the goddess treatment I was fearing from the cheeky title. In fact, even in her current frail state, there is an unencumbered spirit that infuses the often enthralling albeit rather incomplete account of her storied life. Of course her accomplished parents are covered here and not surprisingly her loving but fraught relationship with her iconic mother Judy Garland. It was the aftermath of Garland's 1969 death that led Minnelli to seek the guidance of five key mentors - performer/vocal coach Kay Thompson, singer/songwriter Charles Aznavour, lyricist Fred Ebb, director/choreographer Bob Fosse, and designer Halston. Klein wisely focuses on Minnelli's defining career achievements through their individual contributions. Fosse, in particular, gets deserved attention for guiding her 1972 twin juggernauts, the film version of ""Cabaret"" and the TV special ""Liza with a Z"". However, those looking for a more complete career retrospective might be disappointed because the film ignores true career milestones like her first Oscar nomination for ""The Sterile Cuckoo"", ""Arthur"", and ""Arrested Development"", as well as high-profile bombs like ""Lucky Lady"" and ""New York, New York"" (except the signature song). Close confidants like Mia Farrow and Michael Feinstein act as talking heads for Minnelli who provides brief comments throughout. Nonetheless, the film is a fitting tribute to a true legend who unequivocally escaped the shadow cast by her legendary mother.",False
3,8,A warm & breezy glimpse into a superstar for the ages...,mdw0526,n/a,16/08/2025,"A few weeks ago, we had a Liza Minnelli two-fer, starting with her delightful cameo on the ""Drag Race"" S17 finale followed by this breezy 90-minute documentary that's more a loving tribute than a deep-dive into all that is Liza (which would need a mini-series). I loved the doc from just the name, which sounds like a lyric from ""Ring Them Bells"", and I appreciated the film's focus on Liza's fierce loyalty, a theme as constant as her life in the spotlight. In this film, Liza's icon status is on full display, from childhood memories of Judy Garland to her ""Cabaret"" performance and EGOT-winning career. We hear charming anecdotes, like stepping in to save ""Chicago"" on Broadway, and witness how tragedy shaped her path. It doesn't dwell on rehab or personal darkness, but celebrates her resilience, reminding us that she sparkled from the very beginning.",False
4,10,Bliss. From beginning to end.,dave_hillman,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a huge fan of Liza Minnelli and saw this yesterday. A friend saw it last summer at the Tribeca film festival and told me I'd love it. But I had read a few reviews that noted Klein did not spend any significant time on Liza's films other than Cabaret. As a fan who loved her in other films such as The Sterile Cuckoo, Arthur, Stepping Out and especially New York, New York, I went in somewhat dubious.No worries. The aforementioned films are acknowledged in one way or the other, and it becomes obvious that the filmmaker's approach is not going to be of the traditional ""and then she did this and then she did that"" variety.A lot of material is covered in a fast paced 104 minutes and Klein leaves you wanting more. The film opens with a brilliant sequence detailing Judy Garland's death post-title card and from then on I knew Klein needed no advice from me.There are electrifying goosebumps galore, particularly at the too-soon end (you will know what I mean).There is a lot of backstage stuff I'd never seen. The movie is quite funny, sometimes wickedly so. There's a sly dig at Lorna Luft (blink and you might miss it) that made me laugh out loud. Liza herself semi-narrates and is interviewed on screen (to great, often touching effect).This is a doc that plays like a conventional movie and is accessible to anyone, not just her fans. Broadway buffs will devour it and I hope it receives the Oscar next year. Even though that's a dicey category at AMPAS, I can't imagine this dazzlingly edited, supremely entertaining romp not getting at least a nomination. It's the classy tribute Minnelli has long deserved and she must be over the moon with just how damn good it is.Minnelli has often said she has an eye for picking the right people for the right job when it comes to her work. Well, she's done it again with Bruce David Klein.This sparkling sleeper is a masterpiece. My friend was right. I did love it and can't wait to see it again. In a theatre, which it deserves.It's a flick that will make you happy, and it has entered the world at exactly the right time.",False
5,10,As advertised ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,kenponagajba,n/a,16/08/2025,How this woman does not have a Kennedy center Honor I do not know. She's one every award there is to win EGOT and dozens more. This movie deserves one itself it's fun funny and goes by so fast Don't blink. You'll laugh you'll cry and you'll clap. It's wonderful to see and hear Liza narrate on top of everything else. Pure Bliss. Do not miss this! I wait with bated breath to see it again on PBS what a wonderful love letter to one of the greatest talents of our time. Everyone clapped at the end of this in the theater and that does not happen for movies very often. I cannot remember any that I've seen in the theater where people clapped like this. That tells you everything you need to know. I would have sat through a second showing if they would have let me. The direction and editing are top notch they cover Liza from birth to legend in the blink of an eye. My only complaint is that it was definitely too short it was over so fast like a fun ride at the amusement park. Keep your eye on this to win awards and your hearts. Enjoy everybody.,False
6,6,A bit of a disappointment for those hoping for an exciting story,muffintoprescue,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a lifelong fan of Liza I went into this expecting more. It focuses very specifically on the period of her life between the death of her mother and around 1980.It's really far more about the lives and talents of the many people with whom she surrounded herself and found influence creatively, and I do understand that in many ways that *IS* who she is. However I was hoping for exciting stories and what I got was quite a lot of discussion about how she met and worked with people like Halton, Kander & Ebb etc... and those stories, though beautiful and lovely in their own way, aren't particularly exciting.The documentary seemed to go to great lengths to steer clear of any in depth discussions about anything that might be controvserial or lascivious, and there is even a moment in the film when Liza denies anyone having ever done drugs at Studio 54, which feels less like naive denial and more like a woman who is bound and determined to maintain as pristine a public image as she can (despite her openness about struggling with addiction.)What was really shocking was that her deep and longstanding connection with gay men wasn't even *mentioned*. In fact the only time queerness came up was when it was briefly acknowledged that her first husband was gay, which was yet again a topic that might have been interesting to discuss but was breezed past.There is very little in the way of actual interviews with present-day Liza telling her own stories, and that to me is where the whole project failed the most.It might have fared better as a 60 minute TV special than a nearly two hour documentary, as after the first hour I actually found myself getting bored.Liza herself is a *STAR*. The documentary, for me, just isn't.",False
7,10,A very different sort of biography.,planktonrules,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""American Masters"" is unusual in that is does biographies of famous artists...sort of. What I mean by that is instead of the usual focus on dates and specific events, the focus is much more on both the people around them that shaped the artists as well as their personal style and personalities. This is particularly true with Liza Minelli in this bio, focusing on her friends, personality and those who helped shape and create her on stage and before the camera.The reason I really liked this one is that it really hammers home how lonely her life could be...with problematic marriages, an inability to have children AND how much she is there for others. She seems like a grand lady, who, sadly, in too many cases was used by those who should have just loved her. So, keep some Kleenex handy as you watch...just in case.",True
8,7,"""And then of course it turned on me...like it always does.""",moonspinner55,n/a,16/08/2025,"Splashy documentary on actress/singer/dancer/legend Liza Minnelli isn't really about her movie career or her albums and concerts--it's about Life as Liza: her famous parents (Vincente Minnelli and Judy Garland), her many mentors (Kay Thompson, Charles Aznavour and Fred Ebb among them), her many friends, her marriages and love affairs, her addictions, and her resilience. Beginning with a recent Minnelli interview (in which she's surprisingly bossy), writer-director Bruce David Klein eschews Liza's stage and screen credits (except for ""Cabaret"") in favor of her personal life--something which Minnelli isn't particularly keen on discussing. What Liza does like to talk about is her friendships--she's a loyal lady and gets loyalty in return--and Klein has assembled some good interviews, previously unseen on-stage and backstage footage, and snippets of razzle-dazzle to make this a fast, entertaining 100mns. Half-sister Lorna Luft is interviewed, but their current relationship isn't brought up; Klein would rather give us the histories of Kay Thompson and fashion designer Halston, also a predictable jaunt back in time to Studio 54. I guess if you want to go through Liza's career step-by-step, the many TV-made biographies will have to suffice. Here, we get Vulnerable Liza, Tough Liza, Hard-working and Exhausted Liza. She breaks into song at the end (""But the World Goes 'Round""), accompanied by pianist and great friend Michael Feinstein, but Klein drowns Current Liza out with a clip of '80s Liza belting the song on-stage. We want to know how the lady is doing, but this scrapbook of memories is stuck in the past. *** from ****",False
9,8,The Evolution of an Icon,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's fascinating to see how something truly wondrous comes together from the ground up, witnessing the various components that go into the assembling if its finished form. It's particularly intriguing when that ""something"" is an individual who's tremendously gifted in some way and uses his or her talents to produce astounding works of creativity. That's especially true for those in artistic and entertainment pursuits, as is the case with iconic actress/singer/dancer Liza Minnelli, the famous daughter of actress/singer/dancer Judy Garland and filmmaker Vincente Minnelli. Writer-director Bruce David Klein's new biographical documentary of the legendary entertainer is a revealing look at the professional and personal life of its subject, told in nine chapters, most of which focus on the influences who helped shape the life and career of the storied stage, screen and concert performer. Under the tutelage of her famous parents, as well as mentoring collaborations with multi-talented entertainer Kay Thompson, singer Charles Aznavour, director Bob Fosse, composers Fred Ebb and John Kander, and fashion designer Halston, Liza emerged as one of the most distinguished and readily identifiable figures in show business, rocketing her to stardom on multiple fronts. Her singular look, polished persona and stellar performances placed Minnelli in constant demand, thanks largely to her determination to follow through on every venture she took on, a quality that helped earn her an Oscar, an Emmy, three Tonys and a lifetime achievement Grammy Award. At the same time, Liza's personal life was as ambitious and colorful as her professional pursuits, one filled with more than its share of highs, lows and challenges, all of which are candidly examined, including the stresses brought on by relentless press coverage of these developments. These explorations into her life are backed up with a wealth of archive footage, film clips from Minnelli's Academy Award-winning performance in ""Cabaret"" (1972), and recent interviews with friends, collaborators and entertainment industry observers, including Michael Feinstein, Ben Vereen, Mia Farrow, Joel Grey, George Hamilton, Chita Rivera and actress/half-sister Lorna Luft, among others. This combination of elements makes for an insightful profile of the entertainer, even if it sags a bit in the middle and has an occasional tendency to gush in the presentation of its content. Nevertheless, for the most part, ""Liza"" is a truly terrific true story that shows how success arises when it's carefully conceived, deliberately constructed and meticulously packaged, yielding a result we can all genuinely admire.",False
10,7,Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story,henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary looks at the life of Liza Minnelli following her mother's death and how she then needed to develop herself and outside of her mother's shadow. This is explained in parts which focus on the individuals that influenced and guided her.An odd but extremely fascinating documentary. Minnelli comes across as a pleasant but rather insecure individual, but completely a star and seemingly a loyal friend, but did seem to need guiding lights and mentors throughout her complex starry life. Her life does though also come across as one long party with lots of smiles, glitter and thousands of friends, who are all her 'best friend'. How this helped her is the big question. She undoubtedly has many close, loving friends, but you do get the impression that there are plenty of hangers on as well who may have had a hand in shaping her. Hence, there is a tone of sadness throughout.",False
11,7,What A Fantastic And Nostalgic Look Of Her Life,Yohghurt,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI truly enjoyed this documentary. I would say she has the most colourful life as a star. She lived her life somehow differently than her Mother but her talent and charm outlives. Truly she's one of the start who surpasses fame as a nepo baby. Hearing her singing voice at her age was truly phenomenal, it was from years and years of training and hardwork. Bless her heart. I get to have a look again how she started and how her friendship to my favorite designer 'Halston' became a huge impact in her life. Though still at this age she still refuses to talk about the bad side of Studio 54 it was all a good memory for her. I've seen few documentaries and Liza has really stood out to be the best and loyal friends amongst celebrities. She might have her ups and downs but loyalty is what she truly nurtures.",True

1,n/a,Deranged,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSean Quinn demonstrates nothing but contempt towards the people of Ireland in this documentary. His business dealings were ludicrous and the excuses he's given about that didn't know what bonds he was dealing in is farcical, he's damn well know what they were if he didn't get his profit out of them! I found the documentary / PR exercise nauseating. It was everyone else's fault but his. He was so wealthy that when he did is deals with Anglo and owned well over the central bank allowance in shares of Anglo his arrogance was to conseal it from the regulators! Come on! Look for anyone looking and deciding to watch this self promotional documentary go right ahead as it does give a good story about humble beginnings but that slides to delusional entitlement. The man's arrogance & entitlement knows no boundaries.",True

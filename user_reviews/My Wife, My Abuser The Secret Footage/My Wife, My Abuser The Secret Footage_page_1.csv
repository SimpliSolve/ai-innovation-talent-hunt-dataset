1,8,"So sad, avoided at first but it's worth watching",cqkcnnpg,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI avoided at first bit of a tough watch. Made me think so much and analyse my own experiences, of others and reflect on how hard it is to convince and convict when you're a victim/survivor or abuse.Her behaviour was in the videos and interviews are like watching a snuff film of how to catch a psychopath. So disconnected with reality, so cold.20 years for him to have enough and tell someone. He's had a life sentence and she should have had much longer than what she got. So now, he has to deal with when she comes out. I fear there will be another Netflix on when she comes out and what she did to wangle her way in and kill him and her kids in revenge and how the system let them down.I hope he rebuilds and heals and never has to see her again. I don't normally pray but I will be for his family tonight.",True
2,6,Very important messages watered down by Netflix,arushaelworthy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wish I could have scored this documentary higher. I think it's so important for people to see what can happen behind closed doors and to break down the stigma of men being abused by women.However, Channel 5 have done their usual trick of creating two episodes when the content could easily fit into one and arguably would have been more impactful that way. The use of hidden camera footage is very repetitive. I thought the 1:1 interviews with the victim and police involved were good but would've been just as effective in podcast format.I watched this on Netflix and am a little surprised they bought it without condensing it, but I'm glad they did as it means I could watch it without ads and it'll gain a much wider audience!",False
3,9,A Frightening Insight Into The Mind Of A Psycho Woman,fatfil-414-451797,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI knew nothing about this case when I started watching the documentary, and by the end of it, I was so angry the wife only got 4 years in prison. If this and been reversed, and it was a man attacking a woman over 20 years, I'm sure the sentence would have been harsher. She was purely evil, a calculated, angry, evil piece of work. I'm no shrinking violet, but some of the things she said and did were so beyond just domestic abuse, especially in front of the young children was just shocking. I was genuinely horrified by her behavior, the attack on him with a wine bottle could have been fatal. It was heartbreaking to watch, and the fact that he knew some violence was coming and he went to change his clothes to keep his decent stuff was so sad. He had normalised all this horrific behaviour, and never wanted to fight back. But it was the secret footage where she was physically and mentally abusing him I found the most upsetting. She had absolutely no thought of her kids as they watched this horrific scene unfurl.",True
4,10,Must see,katarinaprgomet,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerVery hard to watch ,but everyone should go and watch it ,man and women equally. Not a fan of some people acting like it's his fault somehow and that he should do this or that - that's full on victim blaming right there. Years of coercive control and emotional abuse would do that to anyone, there is no middle ground there ,other end of it would be if he went into reactive abuse mode ,which thankfully didn't happen in this case, and I'm saying thankfully for his and children's sake. That woman is obviously sick in the head and it's shocking that she got only four years in prison it should be at least 20 with lifelong safety order against her. Hope her sentence will change now after these footages are made public.",True
5,9,Very hard to watch,djpost-70347,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI had not heard of this case before, and decided to watch the documentary out of curiosity. It provides a shocking insight into the abuse that Richard Spencer, a hard working and kind family man suffered at the hands of his cruel, violent, alcoholic wife Sheree over a period of 20 years.During this time, Richard endured increasingly frequent and horrific bouts of violence, cruelty, humiliation, and verbal abuse, some of which was captured on their nanny cam, and finally used, together with photos he had taken of his injuries over the years, to convict her. This only came about after a concerned family friend went to the police, and Richard finally opened up to them when they called at the house to speak to him.Sheree was arrested, and taken to the police station. Throughout the entire police interview, she was emotionless, calculating, and trying to accuse her husband of being the violent and abusive one in the relationship. Even when they showed the footage of her yelling at and beating Richard, including threatening him with a carving knife, there was no emotional reaction whatsoever, just excuses and lies. When they showed the photos of Richard's injuries (including one time when he'd gone to hospital after being beaten repeatedly with a wine bottle, and she had accompanied him but insisted they use a false name), she claimed that he done most of them himself.And perhaps the biggest insight into this woman's twisted mind came when the police told her that they were keeping her in overnight and that they had asked Richard to bring her an overnight bag from home. Her first words were not to ask how the children were or how Richard was, but to say ""He'd better have packed my hair straighteners"". Which he had done, of course because he was still trying to make her happy.Thankfully, the police saw her exactly for the piece of work she is, and she was charged with coercive and controlling behaviour, convicted and sentenced to 4 years in prison. And she even continued to protest her innocence, and blame Richard for all of it right up until the dying minutes of the trial when she finally admitted the game was up and pleaded guilty.These were two intelligent people with successful careers, living in a beautiful house, with the outward appearance of the perfect family, but what was going on behind closed doors was genuinely shocking. Richard's fortitude and restraint in the face of extreme provocation was remarkable, not to mention his loyalty. Even at the end he was concerned about ruining her life by giving evidence, despite everything she put him and his family through.The part I found hardest to watch was that she not only physically assaulted, verbally abused and belittled Richard in front of their terrified young children, but would later tell them when they were alone that it was justified because daddy was a terrible and useless person that they would all be better off without. The impact this would have on those poor children didn't even enter her head. In fact, throughout the whole thing, she showed no remorse or consideration for anyone but herself.The abuse itself is shocking but far more moving for me was the way Richard admitted to managing this situation over time. He developed coping strategies, including compartmentalising everything in his head, so that the part with the abuse was just something to be endured as a price to pay for being with his family, and not upsetting Sheree any further.He'd mitigate the impact of the abuse by changing into shirts with poppers instead of buttons when he sensed it was coming, so that the shirt wouldn't tear when she grabbed hold of it. He and his eldest daughter had worked out a code in the form of a wink when his wife was beating him or verbally abusing him, so that his children could ""side with"" Sheree to avoid upsetting her any further, and he would know that they didn't mean it. When she shut him out of the house in the cold, he knew where the warm spot on the wall was nearest to the boiler. Just heartbreaking to listen to.And the staggering thing is that despite enduring all of this for two decades, not once did he complain to anyone, retaliate, or react in any way beyond physically restraining her when the violence became particularly bad. All he did was keep photos (and later video footage) tucked away on his laptop as an insurance policy in case she tried to stop him seeing his children.Richard is building a new life in another place with his girls, and Sheree is apparently subject to an indefinite restraining order, but a 4 year sentence is short, given the length of time that she put her husband (and her kids) through this stuff. Given how unbalanced she clearly is, I couldn't help wondering if she will come out of prison and want revenge.Harrowing and disturbing viewing, but a very well made documentary on a very difficult subject that is sadly all too common in our broken society. I sincerely wish Richard and his girls all the best for the future and I hope they can rebuild their lives happily and move on from this.",True
6,9,A reminder Domestic Abuse happens in both directions.,pringlepowell,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIgnore a previous review that said the videos were repetitive. Not one video was repeated but because the abuse is so consistent, it might appear that way.This is the hidden side of domestic abuse. The stigma around men being beaten and controlled by the woman in their life is often ignored as men don't feel they can report the abuse. In this case one of the victim's friends broke the news to the police, meaning he would probably have lived with the abuse until the end. His wife is a narcissist, deflecting all allegations away and simply sticking to script by reversing his account of events, from manipulative behaviour, abusive language and assaults.Good interviewing from the officers to hold back such horrendous videos until his wife had given her accounts, however one video was not sufficient.Good impact documentary that I would highly recommend.",True
7,10,So distressing to watch but a must see,tmvbwzqwsz,n/a,16/08/2025,I had no idea of this story before my friend told me about it. Gripping and insightful documentary which is a must see. How any person could be so evil and inflict the pain and suffering on someone she was supposed to care about is completely beyond me and inflicting that also on her three young children is completely baffling. Richard is so brave to share his story and awareness of the abuse he suffered at the hands of his wife. She is evil through and through and is not fit to be a mother. I'm completely baffled that she only got 4 years in prison after the pain and suffering she has caused not only to her husband but to her children and the physical and psychological damage she has put her family through.,False
8,10,Definitely worth watching 10/10,pmasson-07449,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerDon't really watch documentaries so glad I watched this.Extremely unsettling knowing it's real life.So glad Richard found the support & courage to get his life back.Therapy for Richard & kids is a must.Bless them & hope they all recover.As for the abuser karma will avail.How that was in charge of decisions for prison is beyond me.How many decisions were affected by an abuser.Highlights that abusers are not all men.What got me she was moved after months to an open prison which you do not get till near release!CorruptionIf abused make sure to video what you can before lies can be told against you.,True

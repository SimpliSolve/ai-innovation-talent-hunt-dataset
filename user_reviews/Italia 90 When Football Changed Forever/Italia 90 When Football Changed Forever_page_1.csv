1,3,Mixed feelings about this,mcoats-71101,n/a,15/08/2025,"I remember this World Cup very fondly - it's probably the first one I really can recall, apart from some blurred images of Mexico 86. So I had huge expectations when I saw it advertised.I'm now 1.5 episodes in and it seems incredibly repetitive. The first episode focuses totally on England, which is disappointing but I guess understandable. Even so it was purely about hooliganism and what was happening back in England at the time with some flashbacks to Heysel etc. - it's a shame they focused so much on that when you think about the personalities and games that took place during this WC but ok.Now in the second episode it's just an almost complete recap of the first. More about hooliganism, more flashbacks to Heysel, more short pithy sound bites from random journalists saying the same thing about England being sent home if there's any trouble.When are they going to show any of the football?!",False

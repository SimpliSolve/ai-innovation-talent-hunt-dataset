1,7,Media and police malpractice,heather-60379,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember when this case was unavoidable in the news and a national obsession, people passionately ""believed"" the parents were guilty based on weak circumstantial evidence, opinions about child beauty pageants, and police supposition.Ignore the other reviewers who say it's a documentary series made by/for the Ramseys. The actual facts of the case are that the police jumped to conclusions, ignored and kept secret the DNA evidence that exonerated the family, but the police just ""believed"" the parents were guilty. Everything flowed from there. It was sickening media and police malpractice. The hell this family was put through reveals a lot more about the public's relationship to sensational ""news"" that was really just entertainment and clickbait.",False
2,8,A great lesson learned,jnqtjfhy,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary aligns with what really transpired. I recall years ago that if I was in a similar situation, there is not way on this planet I would trust law enforcement or the press. I would lawyer up right away and say nothing.The mistake they made is thinking that because you are innocent and grieving that law enforcement would respect what you are saying. In reality, history like this has proven to do the opposite of what you see on TV. On television, they would not have a series unless they get them to talk. In real life, you simply stay silent else every word will be used against you. Even the media interview was used against them silence is the strategy when innocent.This is still an unsolved murder in my opinion, and yet law enforcement to this day believe the delusional statements made by the incompetent first responders. And the cop that said she feared for her life when John Ramsey looked at her was the most incompetent.",True
3,7,"Interesting and Sad, But a Little Unsatisfying",tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an Interesting and Sad, But a Little Unsatisfying documentary about one of the most famous unsolved murder cases in modern times. This three part series does a good job laying out the case from the night of the murder until now. The case outlines all the permutations and crazy years of focusing on the parents as the prime Suspects. The documentary does a lot but, what it does not do, is definitively point the finger at an alternative suspect. I think the main point of the series is to create pressure on the intransigent Boulder Police to allow outside agencies to use modern forensics to identify the real killer. This is still so sad and I hope the killer is caught while her Dad is still alive.",False
4,7,Police ineptitude saved the murderer,Podkowa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew the case of the mysterious death of JonBenét Ramsey from podcasts. At first view, the case is like hundreds of others - the child goes missing, no one knows anything, no one has saw anything, so the parents are suspects. The difference, however, is that here the police literally did everything not to solve the investigation. They make a lot of mistakes, and while collecting evidence, they forget why they called.Could we find out who killed the girl if only the police did what they should? I don't know, but it would be nice if the police were not extremely incompetent in such delicate cases.The documentary doesn't talk about anything that hasn't already been said. However, it's a very good summary of the investigation, the collected evidence and the theorys about the girl's death (perhaps focusing too much on one of the theories, but still).It's sad to watch documentaries like these, because they remind us that sometimes the perfect crime is the result of a lack of knowledge and investigative skills, not a calculating villain with super intelligence.It's worth watching, but it's even better to google the case and listen to a podcast about it (for example, ""Deception Detective"", who recorded 7.5 hours of material on the subject), because Netflix, as usual, omits a lot of police negligence, and oversimplifies some threads.",False
5,7,If you haven't had a child MURDERED.. shut up!,erikalucasrealestate,n/a,16/08/2025,"I appalled at the comments of both law enforcers, and non-law enforcers on the Ramsey's!! Carol Mckinley talking about how insincere Patsy looked, commenting on her wearing large black subglasses.... ?? Carol, why don't you let us all know what to wear and how to act when we walk out of the church following our childs burial mass!?!? Can you be more ignorant and insensitive? When a family member passes through ""natural causes"" it must be horrifying walking out to the insatiable media and their cameras... can u imagine if it was your young child that was brutally murdered? You're a disgusting person.",False
6,7,"A life taken away, a family destroyed, a society ashamed.",LeonardoOliva69,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary compilation of one of the most controversial and talked about cases during the late 90s.Who really killed this 6 year old girl still remains a mystery and although there have been many suspects, the real culprit has never been found.This documentary is clearly biased towards the vision of JonBenet's father and his family, focusing on how badly the Boulder police acted. By saying this I don't mean that everything is bad...it is obvious that the police acted irresponsibly, negligently, that they planted false evidence and hid information that could have exonerated the family of guilt and yet they didn't. A witch hunt that only slowed down the investigation for years. Perhaps only Lou Smith, the detective who from day one said that the theory of the family's guilt was impossible, was the only one who did things right.As with any case that is so old, contaminated forensic evidence prevented any culprit from being found.It is a strange case from any angle, from the letter written asking for ransom, from the location of the body, the marks, everything that happened. The United States society has a huge problem that goes beyond beauty pageants for 6-year-old girls, which are aberrant in themselves; but also in terms of the possibility and access that sick people have who only want to satisfy their carnal and sick desires at the expense of the innocence of their victims.One more case that I unfortunately doubt will ever be resolved and that left a family devastated and a society exposed to shame.",False
7,6,Important things missing in this documentation,athallica,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was surprised and disappointed by the fact, that the participation of John E. Douglas was not mentioned in the documentation. He was invited by the Ramseys' lawyers as an objective reviewer. He made an excellent analysis, including the behavioural aspect, especially of the ransom note and based on all this he believes that the parents are not the killers or that they cover up their son. It doesn't add up.If you are interested in this part of the case, I recommend his book ""The cases that hunt us"", in which the Ramsey case is one of five or six cases analyzed, and the only one, Douglas participated in. (Jack the Ripper, Lizzy Borden, Black Dahlia Murder, JonBenet Ramsey, Zodiac Killer).Important miss IMHO.",False
8,n/a,That creepy Kid,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have a strong suspicion that the ""creepy kid"" could be the real killer, with the parents possibly attempting to cover it up. His interview with the police and his peculiar behavior over time seem to suggest something is off. He consistently exhibits strange mannerisms and doesn't stray from his rehearsed lines during conversations. It all feels calculated and unsettling. The DNA must be manipulated by the parents ..who knows she wore the same underwear at the time of murder !! There are numerous accounts of the brother's troubling behavior, such as smearing feces on her bedroom walls and leaving unsettling ""gifts,"" like the Christmas package. These actions paint a picture of someone with deeper issues that may warrant closer scrutiny. It raises a valid question: why hasn't the investigation delved further into the brother's involvement? Given these red flags, it seems like a critical angle that has been overlooked.",False
9,6,There's Very LIttle New Here and What is New is Gross,pinotgris-70342,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've watched every JonBenet Ramsey movie, tv series, documentary or tv special since this tragic story aired almost 30 years ago. Other than my heart still sympathetically going out to John Ramsey and his family, there is very little new here. In fact, the only tidbit that I didn't know (to my recollection) was the salacious and disgustingly unnecessary description from John Mark Karr of the 'supposed' sexually explicit encounter he had with her and the autoerotic asphyxia torture of JonBenet by him. Way to turn on all the pedophiles out there, Netflix! Shame on you! I hope the Ramsey family didn't listen/watch that portion.",True
10,10,Opened my eyes,jsclark56,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like many, I had my suspicions that someone in the immediate family was guilty of Jonbenet's murder. However in viewing this documentary, I realize that's exactly what the Boulder PD wanted us all to think with the lies and misinformation they fed to the media. I am shocked that reviewers here are still clinging to the idea that the family was involved when the series showed a deposition of a police detective ADMITTING that there was ZERO evidence implicating the family. The same detective also admitted that the Boulder PD planted false information in the media and WITHHELD the exonerating DNA evidence, probably to cover up their absolute bungling of this case/crime scene. These poor people were put through the wringer and while I didn't learn who murdered this poor child, I did learn once and for all that it was no one in the family. I am so sorry that they had to go through this in addition to the horror of losing their daughter.",False
11,7,Creepy,danielcereto,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just finished this one. The documentary is interesting but at the same time has it's flaws. The execution is acceptable. The length is a but long, and the case is quite interesting to keep you entertained for three and a half hours.First, if you don't know anything about this case, you're going to find it quite interesting if you love true crime. I don't want to spoil anything but it feels creepy from minute one.Second, first episode is great. Second feels too long, but third one is great again. Even the ending is not as accurate as it could have been. Some information is missing.So, overall a good documentary that shows only some light to a dark story.",False
12,8,How To Destroy A Crime Scene,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"And an investigation.Our so-called media just loves to paint people into corners, especially when the people are wealthy, famous, and/or can be perceived as 'controversial'. The Ramsey family were certainly wealthy, and some viewed the pageant circuit as controversial. It could also be argued that the family was somewhat famous, at least in the immediate area, so check, check and check.Given Joel Berlingers diving into other cases, I went in hoping for a documentary that explored all aspects, and not just the popular narrative driven by legacy media. I was not disappointed.Given the perspective of The West Memphis Three, and how his and one other doc managed to overturn the insanity of 'Satanic Panic' and ultimately free three completely innocent young men, I'm hopeful that we may someday be able to say that Jon Benet wasn't harmed by Patsy, by Jon, or (the worst accusation I've heard) her brother, Burke.The ultimate failure ultimate goes to the ridiculous handling of the crime scene and that of the police. I've never seen such a mismanaged cluster by so many, who jumped to immediate conclusions, yet made absolutely zero effort to explore all options, and not just one.OF COURSE any investigation should and usually does center on the small inner circle, HOWEVER, you must simultaneously and methodically gather as much evidence as humanly possible, retain the integrity of the scene (remove all family immediately) and perform extensive and thorough forensic searches AND NOT TELL THE FAMILY TO DO SO, and CERTAINLY not alone. It's nothing short of a miracle that none of the family were charged- but they've certainly endured an ugly cloud of suspicion and ludicrous accusations since that day, and due to the complete and utter ineptitude of numerous law enforcement representatives, nothing of any substance was ever found.One hopes that, much the same as the Memphis Three case, if no one is arrested, maybe innocent people are able to prove their innocence. Which is directly contrary to how our justice system is structured to work- INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY- not the other way around.",False
13,6,Frustrating watch,cb_whitewood,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was not familiar with the JonBenet case prior to watching this documentary, but by the end I understood why this is a case many are passionate about. You're telling me they found the guy... but nothing could be done? The justice system and police force are stunningly useless for solving what MUST be a horrific thing to go through! That frustration really colored the entire watch for me, but I was also deeply unsettled listening to the recorded phone calls with the perpetrator.Trigger Warning: there is a good bit of audio where the perp tries to excuse/justify his actions, and this man goes into detail. If you're sensitive to this sort of thing, definitely avoid this documentary or at least that portion for how graphic it is.Honestly, can't really recommend this. It's made well enough, but extremely depressing.",False
14,4,Seriously?,saintsandstrangers,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you watched the 2016 release, ""The Case Of JonBenet Ramsey"", on Prime Video, you will be disappointed by this 3 episode series!. This series is so slanted towards the pro-Ramsey side, that a very large amount of evidence is completely ignored/omitted. This was largely about John Ramsey and his continual denial that no one in his family could possibly know anything or anyone involved in the death of his daughter. If you have not done so already, please watch "" The Case Of...."", which is on Prime Video, and watch a team of expert forensic investigators, as they deal with the evidence regarding this horrific crime. The case they make, in regards to who actually could have committed this murder is extremely compelling!.",False
15,6,"Fascinating and Tragic, Sadly Missing the Most Likely Scenario",jordan011,n/a,16/08/2025,"A good documentary and a fascinating and tragic true crime show.The reason I have given this a mediocre rating is that it clearly attempts to portray the family as innocent. After quite a lot of research it seems the most likely conclusion is that the young brother of the poor the little girl did it, and the parents covered it up in a fairly incompetent way.This theory is instantly dismissed in the show despite plenty of evidence for it, and I would recommend anyone research this theory online. It explains essentially every aspect of the case and is the most likely scenario.This would have been a 9 or 10 star rating were it not for the bias and sadly not presenting this most likely scenario.",False
16,9,"Harrowing, but fascinating.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"John and Patsy Ramsey are panic stricken one night when they discover that their six year old daughter JonBenét has vanished, their world is shattered when they discover her dead body in the house, a flawed Police investigation follows.The first thing I'll note, this is not a series for the sensitive to watch, some of the content, particularly in the second episode is very harrowing, truly shocking.It's a very revealing, in-depth look at what happened to that poor child, I'm sure we'll all have our views and opinions as to who was guilty, and what happened, one thing is clear, John and Patsy were truly failed by The Authorities.It's incredibly well made, with some very powerful interviews, it's just a shame that The Boulder Police didn't offer up their point of view.The Police carried out a truly shambolic investigation into the crime, why on Earth wasn't an experienced Detective called in to hunt for the killer?The Media also deserve a heap of criticism, their behaviour was truly reprehensible.9/10.",False
17,10,I wasn't sure how to rate this,RaeGal-44611,n/a,16/08/2025,I wanted to rate this low because of the behavior and botched investigation by the Boulder PD especially the cop who wanted her 15mins. What a Joke you are. Shame on you. You had one job to do and couldn't do it. Ignore all the evidence and do your job. These parents were devastated and I know If that was me as a mother I would need to be high as a kite to get through the day.Then.........I wanted to rate this high because it clearly shows the family's point of view. This does not show us anything new and I really don't think there will ever be anything new. They lost their opportunity when the police failed to do their job and not be bias and dumb.Everything points to a crime of opportunity after some sick weirdo broke in to hurt her and then things took a turn. I pray one day they find that weirdo.,False
18,1,Nothing but a Pro-Ramsey Infomercial,nicktab,n/a,16/08/2025,"Look, if you believe that an intruder would stick around to write a War and Peace length ransom note on the Ramseys' own stationary while three people were sleeping in the house who could wake up at any minute, with absolutely zero sign of a break-in, and the ransom note's handwriting being uncannily similar to Patsy's when analyzed, then I can't help you. This was so one-sided toward the Ramseys I couldn't watch the final episode. At least tell me that before I waste my time watching this drivel. Did the Boulder police botch the first 24-48 hours at the crime scene, hell yes. But that doesn't mean the Ramseys still aren't responsible. A more balanced presentation would have been nice.",False
19,10,A Gripping Exposé of Injustice-The Truth About JonBenét Ramsey,hwnzfdt,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary exposes the truth behind the tragic case of JonBenét Ramsey. While the Boulder Police and media spun false narratives to blame her parents, this documentary shows how badly the investigation was mishandled. The authorities, lacking proper homicide experience, fed lies to the press rather than admitting their mistakes. JonBenét's family endured unimaginable pain, worsened by media harassment.Thank God for Lou Smit, a humble and skilled detective who sought justice. His work proves the real killer is still out there. Every community needs a detective like Lou. A must watch!!!!",False
20,10,Interesting and sad,g_veldman,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary perfectly illustrates how the police and media can go down the wrong path-and convince the public of it as well. How difficult must it have been for JonBenét's family? To lose your daughter and then also be falsely accused. Any rational person can see that the theories accusing the parents are complete nonsense, even without watching this documentary. The father was not paid for the interview. I could feel his love for his children and wife. I don't know how you can find joy in life after this happened. He is a strong man. Hopefully, new DNA testing will be conducted. Perhaps then this cold case can finally be solved. RIP JonBenet and Patsy.",False
21,4,Incredibly Biased,aljosc,n/a,16/08/2025,"While the documentary as a whole isn't poorly made, it is extremely biased towards the intruder theory. It attempted to present itself as non-biased, but this simply isn't true. Copious amounts of important information are omitted to turn viewer opinions away from skepticism of the parents. If you are new to this case, it will be an enjoyable watch. If you are already interested in this case, you will be yelling at the TV the whole time.If there is anything this documentary did well, it remembers to present the victim as a human rather than a piece of evidence in a murder case. You will really get to know JonBenet and feel sad about her horrible fate. This is something many true crime docs forget.",False
22,8,The Media and Police haven't learned anything,rjm650707,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI rememeber all the news when this story first came out and over time the misinformation and lies was so obviously insane to just sell papers and get attention. The intentional leaking by the police to the media was so stupid. You can't go off of opinions and theories and leak them as truth like the Boulder Police did. The media sure loves to talk and not tell facts and truth. I feel so angry for the parents and family. All the stupid online sleuths leave Burke alone! The stupid female detective who went on to accuse Jon of killing his own daughter on national TV, shame on you!! I hope you pay for your lies!!! Mr. Ramsey, you are a true hero for how you handled this whole ordeal! May God bless you and your family!",True
23,10,Best Documentary of the Year!,acaciapollock,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary revealed so much important information about all of the lies Boulder Police Department deliberately put out into the media over the years. It also showcased how an entire department can have such a bold and unprecedented prejudice for the guilt of a suspect(s) without any shred of evidence, which blinded them and caused them to completely botch the case from the beginning. This well told story needed to be filmed to get justice for this poor little girl and to call for a well rounded investigation into what happened to her. Few documentaries get me to feel as passionately about the outcome as this one did, as I was immersed in every part of every episode. I felt incredible empathy for the immediate family and anger for JonBenét for what she went through. Definitely a recommended watch!",False
24,1,Did the Ramsey paid you for this documentary?,messagejulied,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just how many evidences was left out from this documentary. Starting by the end of the call that was not played. I highly recommend people interested in this case to watch true crime rocket science en youtube or to read perfect murder perfect town. This documentary was the most basic, easy put together documentary. It feels like it was a high-school project that ended up on Netflix. The only true scoop that we are getting is that John pretty much had veto on when to end Patty's like when she was at the end of her life suffering with cancer and even that scoop was not really researched at all, no details.",False
25,9,Another Quality Documentary from Joe Berlinger,Pequod88,n/a,16/08/2025,"It can't be stressed enough that there was only one murder in Bolder in the year before the killing of JonBenet Ramsey. Inexperienced police, coupled with unprecedented media coverage, is a recipe for a corrupted crime scene, hasty conclusions, and an unprofessional refusal to admit mistakes as additional facts come to light. Retired Detective Smit emerges as a voice of reason, professionalism, and wisdom.The beauty pageants seem odd at first glance, yet wealthy parents encouraging charismatic kids to perform and compete is only creepy when a pedophile joins the audience. Shirley Temple was an uncontroversial star in the 1930s with routines and roles that put her precociousness in the spotlight. In the late 90s, the innocence of the kids and applause of parents and grandparents may well have been tainted by a serpent in the room.While a sick photographer or fringe character may have become obsessed at a pageant, the real story is profiteering media looking to make entertainment from tragedy, and detectives looking for a book deal and notoriety. DNA science has come a long way since 1997, yet tainted samples are not likely to lead to justice. The documentary does a very good job of digging deep and exploring many possibilities.The appeal and spread of unlikely conspiracy theories has become much more prevalent in the years subsequent to the murder. Amateur sleuths who favor the fantastical over the factual are everywhere, yet Detective Smit, along with some retired detectives and investigative reporters, provides evidence that professionalism and a genuine desire to ferret out the truth can still be found. Director/Producer Joe Berlinger has a long track record of stellar work, dating back to Brother's Keeper (1992). Recommended.",False

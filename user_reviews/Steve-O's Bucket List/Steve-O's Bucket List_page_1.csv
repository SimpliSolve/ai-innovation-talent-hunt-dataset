1,6,"Funny, but definitely overhyped",AngusRocker22,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're a fan of the Jackass crew you'll get some enjoyment out of this, but temper your expectations - most of the stuff you've heard about this special is way overhyped. It's in the format of the actual Bucket List Tour show, so the vast majority of it is Steve-O explaining the events leading up to the bits, and then over-explaining the bits instead of letting them play out on screen, then you see the actual bits - which were usually pretty short. I kind of wish he went with something like a more traditional Jackass structure, but Steve-O's bread and butter is his tour now. Overall, if you're a Steve-O fan, and want to some of the old crew back together, you will likely find this entertaining.",False
2,6,You May Vomit In The Bucket!,damianphelps,n/a,16/08/2025,"Awkwardly I gave this movie the same rating as Steve O Gnarly. The problem is its actually a better movie, but its not worth a 7.Steve O is a good story teller and can be interesting to listen to. He did a good podcast with DCEO that was a good watch.Bucket list is a little bit of a mixed bag, some of the stunts are entertaining and funny, a couple of them are a bit ew.Clearly a man with no shame and absolutely an attention whore (as he readily admits).What will be interesting for me is where he goes next. He has grown as an indivdual and a performer but I will be fascinated to see where the development takes him :)PS for some reason I found the fainting hilarious.",False
3,4,It is way more sad than funny.,gina_gemini,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been a Jackass fan and am not easily shocked but I guess there is a reason some of these stunts didn't feature on that show. Besides the shock factor Jackass tried to keep a balance between being shocking and funny and entertaining, at least for their target audience.Here, Steve O tries to think of the most shocking ways you can perform a stunt and hoping that it'll make for viral entertainment. But in reality the end product is the sad attempts of a middle aged man near the end of his career looking for one last hoorah, and hopefully a payday.I don't know what more to make of this but I wish he would work harder on his stand up act if he looks forward to transitioning into a more age appropriate career.",False
4,10,Amazing!,callelitegrann,n/a,16/08/2025,"Steve-O delivers once again with out question. I laughed so hard at this, the way he tells the stories and talks about his journey is something else.Normally these shows ease you into it but this one does not, it slaps you right across the face and throws you in to a world of Steve-O craziness.The way everything is put toghether makes you long for a sequal so lets hope we see one even more screwed up and crazy than this one. Let it be known to viewers, this is not for the faint of heart. This show will push your limits and put your stomach to the test.Prepare for alot of laughter and well planned crazy entertainment.",False
5,2,Just Sad,mau_rodrgues,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI grew up watching jackass and I always liked the balance between funny and crazy stunts, but here it's just something very sad to watch, it's not funny at all, the back sedation stunt is one of the saddest things he did, sedated and taking Paintball shooting as always, nothing new, it's not funny, it's just humiliation, even worse than the vasectomy, I hope Steve understands that humiliating himself isn't the part that made jackass funny.He always mentions how he was a drug addict and managed to overcome that, but now it seems like he just wants to satisfy his Ego and not be funny.This special is just to shock the audience and not to make them feel funny...",True
6,2,Vile and not funny,TheGMang,n/a,16/08/2025,"We're good Steven. We don't need anything else from you. We're good on the 'content' and the hot sauce and the everything else.This special isn't funny even though he thinks it is. It's not shocking even though he thinks it is. It's just gross and vile. It's not entertaining even though he thinks it is. He's been smelling his own farts for too long. He says as much.Any humor or charm this dude had is long gone, completely. This doesn't even feel remotely fun like his other material. Even the bit with irrelevant Burr is completely limp, but it's the closest thing to interesting fun stunt work in this cultural diarrhea.So your time will be better spent watching essentially anything else in the genre.Steve could put some kind of spin on things and make it fresh or relatable or fun. Maybe charity of some kind. Cleaning up garbage. Raising awareness of something we can all get behind with a wacky silly stunt. Literacy. Anything. This special shows just how self involved empty this guy really is upstairs. Completely vapid and degenerate with nothing redeeming. Just burn out already because you've already overstayed fade away. Dude.",False
7,1,See garbage without having to smell it,farleym-19442,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show reflects no talent rather the willingness to do anything shocking to make a dollar. If Painted penises, bowel movements, self mutilation are your thing you have found your place.I fear that some confused children may find this crap amusing and try to duplicate his ""humor"" and end up harming themselves.To brand this a love story is hard to wrap my head around. I see some hangers-on gathering to grab some crumbs as they fall.I am unable to think of anything else about this movie other than I am glad I watched it on a free site. To pay for it would have been the real crime.In case I forgot to mention it. I found this without merit as entertainment. Merely a freak show; an accident on the roadside of life's highway.",False
8,2,Surrounds himself with better people,thestevemcinnes,n/a,16/08/2025,"The guy made fun of Brendan Shaub, but I legit get zero comedy from him. Im begging to watch Shaub after 20 mins of Bucket list Y
You would get better from The Man ShowMaybe Steveo should stick to stunts as he is the only one that finds himself funny.He legit just rambles about how he is sober and how cool he was, but everything feels vain and living on past glories.If this ""special"" is his his first, Im just guessing his second will be silence because I can't imagine anything better than him just blabbering without punchlines, set up or structure.Im sad he thinks he is a comedian. Just do deep podcasts and have great depth. You inspire and help me let alone everyone suffering.That said, happy for your sobriety and proud of your sobriety brother. Stay gold and more than happy yo dispute. Just being honest.",False

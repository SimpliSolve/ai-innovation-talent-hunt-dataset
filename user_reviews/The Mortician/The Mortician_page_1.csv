1,7,Heartless Sociopath,pnwgirl,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's hard to know how to rate this, but I'd give it a 7 out of 10 for the storytelling. The whole thing is deeply disturbing. David Sconce tells his story, as he puts it, ""I'm an open book. I'll talk about anything."" Very soon you come to understand it's because the guy has no moral center.He figures because some ash from other cremations get into the next cremation, that completely justifies stuffing bodies in by breaking collarbones and using a meat hook on the corpses to throw them in there 15 at a time, like cattle. He sees it that way so it's okay.""No one cared about these people, they were scattered at sea. I just don't understand why it makes any difference. They weren't going to be viewed.""Wow. Just wow.It's not enough to say he's a narcissist or a sociopath, though he probably checks every box. The deeper truth is that some people refuse to see the humanity in others. And when that happens in a position of power like this, a mortician, a doctor, a caregiver... it just becomes evil. The kind that hides behind logic, hides behind business, and destroys lives in the process.Gut wrenching documentary. I'm glad the story was brought to light, but I really hated giving this psychopath a megaphone to tell his side of the. He's a disgusting human being.",False
2,8,It Just Gets More and More Shocking,thalassafischer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Mortician is a well constructed documentary and I am making sure to hide this behind a spoiler tag, since I don't want to ruin it for anyone else. The story unfolds chronologicaly, a little like a novel. You have been warned!Lamb Funeral Home was a trusted, reputable business. Images of old-timey conservative religious people are evoked: the kind of clean living, hard working Americans, who have the peculiar constitution - possibly supported by their Christian faith - to be able to run a funeral home in which the deceased are treated with dignity and the grieving family is comforted.Enter All-American suburban preppy grandson, David Sconce. David was handsome, with wavy blonde locks, and a reputation as a football star. Really, the perfect family.As I am sure you know, a lot of times these picture perfect families are the most sinister. Of course this little creep was actually a sociopath almost in full view. Like the villain in an 80s teen flick, upon graduation and being pushed to get a morticians certificate to join the family business, David starts committing crime after crime. At first he was just cremating too many people all at once, it was a bit of a let down. As a horror fan and someone isn't especially squeamish, I am like yeah its dishonest, disrespectful and sacrilegious probably but not shocking. He would just stuff too many bodies into the burner and wasn't too particular about whose ashes were whose, so families didn't realize they were taking a mix of sometimes 3, 4 or more bodies home in an urn.But it gets SO, SO, SO much worse! David is gleefully stealing gold teeth and jewelry and selling it at pawn shops for cash. His young wife catches him in the garage, diligently smashing human teeth with a hammer to get at the gold.By the end of the first episode, it is clear David is a psychopath, a grim blight to his respected and unsuspecting churchy family.Oh wait, surprise, the entire family are secretly psychopaths stretching back to grandpa. There are so many more details.",True
3,7,A Gruesome Docuseries That Blurs the Line Between True Crime and Psychological Horror.,Papaya_Horror,n/a,16/08/2025,"HBO's ""The Mortician"" starts strong, hitting hard-especially for someone like me, unfamiliar with the story of David Sconce and the Lamb Funeral Home, yet all too familiar with the real-life atrocities that sow the seeds of something profoundly dark, unsettling, and inhuman.Unlike many documentaries that tiptoe around real-life horror, ""The Mortician"" doesn't flinch. It tells a story so horrifying that one might argue it shouldn't be told at all-or perhaps, it absolutely must.It reinforces a truth I often find: reality is far more terrifying than any horror film you'll ever watch.""I don't put any value on anybody after they're gone and dead."" - David Sconce""I don't put any value on anybody after they're gone and dead."" - David Sconce
That single quote crystallizes the chilling apathy at the heart of this story. Delivered with dead-eyed indifference, it feels like a final nail in the coffin of human decency.Though ""The Mortician"" is a well-constructed three-part docu-series, it doesn't quite reach its full potential.Episode two lingers too long on familiar exposition, where a deeper exploration of the families impacted, or Sconce's warped moral reasoning-could have added depth.Director Joshua Rof√© clearly knows how to balance intrigue and revulsion, peeling back the layers in a slow-burn fashion that grips the viewer.But there are moments-particularly in the midsection-where the pacing dips, and some emotional beats go unexplored.The first episode lays the groundwork brilliantly, charting the early warning signs of a psychopath with a chilling, psychological precision.It plays like a grim psychological prelude, grounding the audience in the very real nightmare that unfolds.Flaws aside, it's absolutely worth a watch. Like death itself, it confronts us with something inevitable yet harrowing-and what makes it even more terrifying is how a trusted business exploited grieving families, turning loss into a real-world horror show.""The Mortician"" unveils another grim reality: a true story of desecrated bodies and a grandiose narcissist whose delusions of power spiraled into something monstrous.It is an unflinching, grotesque mirror reflecting a brutal truth:
No industry is immune to horror when profit is the prize, and ""The Mortician"" doesn't let us look away.",False
4,7,Grotesque,hkgxukw,n/a,16/08/2025,"He was wrong for not getting the permission from the families.He is definitely an odd and creepy guy.What is interesting is that with mass regulations and oversight, the industry remains ridiculously greedy. The doc liked to mention how cultures used to and still want to treat the dead with respect. That comes with a hefty price tag. Average funeral costs are 20k for cheap. The wealthy get proper burials while the poor can barely afford cremation.David had valid points about ocean cremation and other types of scenarios but he was wrong to disregard the loved ones and wrong to profit in the manner he did. He should have done it all above board and would still be living off the hog had he just done it the correct way. Greed is a heck of a drug.Who believes he has no contact with his Mother?",False
5,7,Why!?,toro_tt,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBIG SPOILER!Chilling last scene when he thinks the camera is off and confess to 3 murders like it was nothing.What I DONT understand is at that moment, the guys that are filming him already tricked him that the camera was off because they had to reload it, he then wants to tell them more about the murders if they promise not to tell anyone and they just answer that they dont want to know, that they DONT want that information.They had him right there and then!!A confession. Justice for the victims families. But choose not to? Why!!??Due to fear?I just cant understand why they told him that they dont want that information..
Imagine a family member of one of the murdered victims watching this..Its just incomprehensible.I cant understand why!?",True
6,10,On the edge of my seat every episode,blacksh-42467,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary has had my mouth open the entire time. I can't lie. It is really well done so let's start there. Whomever decided to do this documentary, kudos to you because you have my attention. However, the subject matter is very sad. David is evil and lacks any human compassion but the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I would recommend watching it, just prepare yourself, especially if you've recently lost someone. This probably isn't the documentary I'd recommend. Unfortunately, a lot of this documentary is about greed and evil people. Now I am worried about what happens after we die and go to the funeral home. This family can't be the only ones. Smh.",True
7,9,As Beautifully Crafted as it is Disturbing,tommylib,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Mortician is an outstanding documentary, well crafted, perfectly edited, and deeply disturbing.HBO is killing it with documentaries lately and The Mortician is no exception. The gruesome details of the Lamb Funeral Home practices and the disturbing sociopath that is David Sconce are slowly and painstakingly unveiled in this three-episode masterpiece.The depths of the criminal activity emerge even as each of the self-serving witnesses give their own sides of the story. Everyone is likely lying to one degree or another and, despite that, a compelling picture of the actual crimes emerges clear as crystal.The inadequate prison sentences, engendered by the lack of statutes at the time, and the distress they cause the victims is deeply painful to watch and also completely compelling.I was nauseated at every turn but never considered turning it off. Not easy to watch to be sure, and difficult to digest but absolutely worth it.",False
8,10,Holy moly,richardrc-18596,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat a documentary. I'll keep it short and sweet. This documentary was very informative about a topic you never think of. Death. And the process thereafter. Educational and sinister all at once. The lamb funeral home was full of schemers and crooks. From sweet old Mrs lamb to the son. They were all in on it. And the workers all knew and were all in on it too. Just a shame. At the beginning I actually somewhat agreed that it doesn't matter how many bodies do get cremated at once as they are just bodies. But then, after awhile and seeing/hearing some of the people's stories, you do agree it's not right. Idk how I'd feel if one of my family members was a ""victim"". Considering I'm a Christian and the soul is the ultimate part of our person, the body being cremated alone or together and the ashes remaining are really irrelevant. But, to some, I understand the importance. I will say if the contract they signed (not the forged ones) stated tissues would be removed then I would think legally they can do whatever with them. Maybe immoral but it's now their property. I def think sconce has killed 3 people with waters being 1 of them. I think it's really telling that he never mentions or talked about his own kids. Didn't even seem to care about them. Egotistical, self-centered, narcissistic, sociopathic turd.",True
9,3,One episode would have done. (Mild spoiler),joachimokeefe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDavid Sconce, the mortician in question; turns out he would have been at home in Auschwitz - on the administrative side. As the series runs, it seems that his sweet, charismatic mother, and grandfather (who founded the Lamb Funeral Home) were no better, it's just that David industrialized things.The d√©nouement is David hysterically suggesting that corpse-robbing and body-desecration weren't the worst he got up to, in the same way that the Robert Durst HBO series led to a prosecution for murder. This time, it doesn't work. It's horribly fascinating watching a full-blown sociopath acknowledging the horror of what he's done and finding nothing but amusement in it, but that's all. Think Heinrich Himmler, giggling.So after three long episodes, Sconce still doesn't get it, or his comeuppance.If you want a takedown of the US funeral industry, read Evelyn Waugh's 'The Loved One' (the 1965 movie has a 6.9 here). If you want to gawp at a lowlife getting TV validation for three hours, I suppose you could do worse than this.",True
10,10,The Horror and Greed of the Funeral Industry,jeannettelouisesmith,n/a,16/08/2025,"The crimes committed by the Lamb Family and David Scone were horrific. I sympathize with families who were betrayed and fell prey to the greed and heinous mistreatment of their loved ones. The justice system completely failed the numerous grieving families. It's time to rethink the traditional ways Americans honor and bury their dead. Cremations contribute to climate change and traditional burials negatively impact the environment. Like Laurieanne Lamb Sconce, it was her job to ""care"" and appear sympathetic in order to make money off of people's grief. Keep your loved one alive in your spirit - without going broke or betrayed.",False
11,8,Mortician review,jacobcasack-68362,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI liked it but I hated the snitches. I don't think anything is more pathetic than an old man snitching and bragging about snitching as if he's some kind of hero. At one point he said he's blacking out his face to protect his identity not because he's scared of the kind but because he's afraid of what he'll do to the guy if he saw him. That doesn't even make any sense. All these employees snitched on the mortician family to avoid getting time but act like they're heroes or something for testifying. All of these families were grieving their loved and acted like their family were murdered. Their anger was misplaced. David's right, after a person dies their bodies are just flesh. Does it matter if organs are taken out of a body that's about to get burned to ash.",True

1,6,"""Volcanic UFO Mysteries"" (2021): Hot Topic Tantalizes",jtncsmistad,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lots of questions. No answers. At least none conclusive. Yet.The captivating documentary ""Volcanic UFO Mysteries"" features video footage of what appear to be flying crafts hovering around, above and disappearing into, active and smoldering volcanoes all about Latin America. Speculation by some observers is that these may be alien ships juicing up with fuel derived from inside these volatile mountains to enable further flight around the world and across the universe.And then the film hits us with this eruptive revelation: Reports from mainstream media outlets and the U.S. military itself about unidentified craft (even going so far as suggesting possible aliens within them) somehow disabling nuclear missiles.What on earth? Or more aptly, not of our planet at all?",False
2,1,Watching this made me want to jump into a Volcano,Dan_Hansell,n/a,16/08/2025,My family and I bonded after watching this show. We don't see eye to eye on many things these days but we all agreed on how foolish this show was (and then we watched kitten videos on Youtube).I don't recommend.,False
3,10,important doco that needs to be seen,miguelitos,n/a,16/08/2025,Objects are being seen that cannot be explained. I enjoyed Stephen Bassett's and Jaime Maussan's commentary. Mr. Maussan does a good job of summarizing the evidence without jumping to conclusions.... Maussan makes it clear that he has some suggestions for what we are observing but that in fact...He has no idea what it is. This type of dialogue is important with this topic because we need to gather data and study these objects objectively. Scientific evidence legitimizes the study of UFO's and opens the door to a wider study and an increased opportunity to solve the mystery.,False
4,10,Hands down most convincing UAP videos I've seen to date.,adderallnationdestiny,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't expecting much from this little doc, but this had better video of UAP's flying around and going into a volcano (of all things) than any military or civilian video I've seen. The documentary starts out kinda cheesy with cartoon illustrations setting things up for the viewer but then they start dropping epic legit UAP vids that I've never seen before. I'm shocked this hasn't come up more in main stream media. Very cool stuff. Highly recommend watching!",False

1,6,Glitter: The Popstar Paedophile,Prismark10,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gary Glitter was the epitome of Glam Rock back in the early 1970s. Even his backing band went on to have their own hits.By the late 1970s he had disappeared. Glam was overtaken by punk and he was made bankrupt.It was not the end, he made his comeback in the mid 1980s. In the ITV kids pop music show Razzmatazz. Glitter explained his thinking behind the video for his comeback song Dance Me Up.So many people had asked Glitter where he had disappeared to. He decided that the video be set with Glitter in prison.Fast forward to 1997. Glitter's dark secret was out. Child pornography was found on his computer after he took it to a branch of PC World for repair.By then Gary Glitter was doing well with the nostalgia crowd. He was happy to mock his glam past in ad campaigns.Now he was jailed for four months and faced accusations of sexually abusing girls. Those claims did not succeed in court.The game was up for Glitter. His name was mud and in the late 1990s he had fled to southeast Asia.The press had a field day each time they saw Glitter near a computer. There were reports of Glitter abusing kids in Cambodia. Later he was jailed in Vietnam for abusing two young girls.After the revelations about Jimmy Savile. Some famous stars had nowhere to hide. Glitter was sentenced to 16 years behind bars in 2015 for abusing three schoolgirls between 1975 and 1980.There was a bit of finger wagging in this documentary but little that was new. A few celebrities were interviewed to give their insights, that Glitter like Savile was always hiding in plain sight.There had been suspicions in the past about Glitter. Most of the press seemed to be happy to play down such allegations as almost hijinx. Well other popstars had undersage sex and did not even get a police caution. No wonder these celebrities thought they could get away with it.",False
2,7,Terse documentary about the rock star,kirk781,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGary Glitter was primarily a famous glam rock star in 70s UK famous for songs like ""Rock and Roll part 1"". The film associates mainly with his child pornography issue (due to which he ran into the law circa 1997 first). I am not sure how many revelations are new in this documentary since I am not from UK and had only a cursory idea of who Gary Glitter was. The scenes involving his fleeing to Cambodia and Vietnam and being arrested there were new to me.I wished the documentary had dug deeper though than just surface level. This person was the surface. Rock and Roll industry was probably full of such folks high on power thinking that law couldn't touch them.Eithercase, it's only an hour and it hardly gets boring or overwrought; not a bad documentary.",True

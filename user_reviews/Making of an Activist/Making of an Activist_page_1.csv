1,1,A movement based on a lie,ksgillihan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being an activist is not a bad thing. Many huge changes in our society were brought out by the movements of activists. However, if you want to sink your heart and soul into something, at least be honest and upfront about it. Consider the fact that the very notion of the case of Michael Brown being not about race in any way; you might want to take that into account when you want to form your life around something and then turn it into a filmRemember ""hands up, don't shoot?' Yeah that never happened. We've known this for years and years yet there are still people out there who swear it happened and they rant on and on about the lie the media made up when the case first happened. These kinds of people require strife and division in order to feel like they have a place or that they are important. Or most likely, for nothing more than attention.Michael Brown was not killed by a blood-thirsty and racist police officer, he was killed because he was caught doing criminal things and he tried to take the officers gun. That is a fact. Two different investigations including one by the FBI, spear-headed by the attorney general of the United States even. They found that the officer did nothing wrong. Yet the media never said they got things incorrect. Then never even addressed it. How is that ok? This film is a farse based on a lie.",False
2,9,Thoughtful and moving documentary,luckyc-76416,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a thoughtful and moving documentary about a difficult and painful subject that I recently had the chance to watch in the US.I don't usually leave reviews on here but felt compelled to do so because of the current imdb rating which is very different to Letterboxd where I usually review and came across this film, and where it is highly rated.It's a compelling doc that exposes how much the police have been getting away with in this day and age, but it gives me hope that there are people our there who are trying to combat these injustices.The filmakers did an amazing job in crafting a compelling narrative throughout the film, the cinematography is beautiful and utilisation of archive material is outstanding. I also really loved the music and sound design. Highly recommended.",False
3,10,User who rated low clearly didn't watch,dnfoubert,n/a,16/08/2025,"I normally do not leave reviews, but felt the need to because of the inaccurate review with the low rating. The one star reviewer obviously did not watch this documentary. ** This is not a documentary about Michael Brown ** Michael Brown is mentioned, his mother interviewed, and Ferguson footage is shown - but this documentary deals more with the data that has since been (and is being collected) on police violence, the impact of police unions and contracts, and lack of accountability in police disciplinary actions.This is an important watch for anyone living in America, and provides data and resources needed to impact change.",False

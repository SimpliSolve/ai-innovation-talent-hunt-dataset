1,9,Puts you in your feels!!!,RoyMince,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a type of film that you see about every 5 to 10 years and they're always relatively good like your sports movies. Very creative and entertaining this one dives deep into historical points. It's amazing what humans can accomplish when everyones vibes are in sync. That leads one to believe they are meant for a bigger purpose on this planet. Do you listen to the messages or do you ignore them? That's a question that you ask if you ever faced with having to fulfill a destiny. This is the kind of film that a done really right itself but overall the cast and crew did an amazing job with the acting, and it was a very well written project. Two thumbs up. I would Recommend to all, great job.",False

3,10,Best feel good documentary I've seen!!,clarisamogollon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Music is such a powerful force and when music and passion get together, anything is possible. This documentary gave me goosebumps and happy tears and excitement as if I was there. I shared the documentary with friends and I got exactly the same reaction: happy tears, excitement and the overall feeling that anything magical is possible. Highly recommend this, even to non music fans.",False

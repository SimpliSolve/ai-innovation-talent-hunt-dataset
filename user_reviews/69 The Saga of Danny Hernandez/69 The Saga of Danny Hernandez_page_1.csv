1,6,Don't blame the director/documentary for the garbage 69 is!,Diogo_VilaVerde,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't planning on reviewing this title but after reading the few reviews I feel like I had to.People are giving poor reviews on the documentary because they don't like the subject. Me neither folks, that guy is an absolute piece of garbage but the documentary is done in a competent manner and it is interesting actually!It is presented with a lot of evidence and footage in a somewhat impartial manner, so you always see his side but at the same time you see people talking about the absolute trash he is.So,in my opinion, you shouldn't blame the quality of the documentary on the subject the director choose to document, because the documentary is done quite well and makes you want to see it. It's not Citizen Kane of course but give it a try ! It's not like it's going to change your mind on what the rapper is but at least you can follow how things got to this point !",False
2,7,Conflicted- but I think the quality is there,itsamandacrispino,n/a,16/08/2025,"A little annoyed at myself for even clicking this doc out of curiosity, because idk how, but i didn't know of him at all, and the rainbow hair got me. And obviously I don't think this person deserves any more attention. I will say, I'm pretty intrested to see what it's creator comes out with in the future. So many poorly thrown together documentaries come out on streaming platforms, and at least after watching this I didn't feel duped in that way. I felt like even if it wasn't 100%, the person who made this cared about doing a good job.",False
3,5,An interesting watch for one seeking a man,Mysterygeneration,n/a,16/08/2025,"""69: The Saga of Danny Hernandez"" is a fascinating up-and-down look at the rise and fall of the controversial rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine. Where the documentary really succeeds is in capturing the chaotic energy of his meteoric rise to fame, but at times it feels like sensationalized spectacle more than deep exploration into the complex persona behind the rainbow-haired provocateur. The film touches on serious topics relevant to the influence of social media and the implications of living life from controversy, which it lacks nuanced storytelling to unpack. Despite all its inadequacies, ""69: The Saga of Danny Hernandez"" remains an interesting watch for one seeking a man behind the headlines, although some deeper questions are left open.",False
4,1,absolute garbage,plargreg,n/a,16/08/2025,Hope this makes no money and everyone realizes this person deserves no attention or fame,False
5,n/a,No one forced you to watch this.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Did someone forced y'all to watch this? No? Then why are you giving this 1/10 lmao.You are giving 1 because it's about 6ix9ine. It's like you hate Tom Cruise so you go and rate every Tom Cruise movie ""1"" star. Use your logic.If you do some research about 6ix9ine's life, you will actually understand him. He is a good person(i'm not being sarcastic).",False
6,1,Just watch ratatouille,youthinkicarelolqq,n/a,16/08/2025,There was no point in making a documentary on the same concept of ratatouille,False
7,1,Terrible,jonathanalfarof,n/a,16/08/2025,This is the worst documentary ever. I don't know why Hulu made this documentary film.,False
8,8,Not a 69 production,The Sheen,n/a,16/08/2025,I'd never known anything about Tekashi69 other than his ridiculous persona and him being ridiculed on The Breakfast Club. Never heard his music. Watched this and it was genuinely interesting. It does not promote him whatsoever. Just tells a pretty crazy story of a kid from NYC who happened to create a not so great story for himself. Give it a whirl. It's very well done and worth watching.,False
9,1,"There's no saga, no story.",ridwanulkarim,n/a,16/08/2025,Desperate cry for attention and shamelessly claiming to be a musician. Just ploy of personal branding by a shameless hoodlum.,False
10,1,Waste of time,curejudith,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sorry but this guy is an idiot, rude and pathetic. What a waste of time.",False
11,9,Learn to watch a movie objectively and through a critical eye.,katienunn-58944,n/a,16/08/2025,"You should listen to what the producer said at the very beginning of the movie. That they were interested in the difference between the persona people show online versus their real, interior self. Who is Danny Hernandez? The people who are reviewing this in a negative way cannot understand that you can watch this from an objective standpoint. This documentary talks about the real world themes such as the cycle of poverty, generational trauma, anger, what masculinity looks like, etc through the story of 69.I truly do hope that this movie begins a conversations about rap culture, why young men and young, at risk youth are attracted to hip hop, and what it means to show dominance and masculinity in our society.",False
12,10,Don't rate it bad if you haven't seen it,Nhanna5094,n/a,16/08/2025,I've never liked 69 but the other night one of my homegirls had said she started watching this show with interviews from people who knew 69. I've only ever known him as a troll and a rat. But i lit one up and turned it on. It's the story of a Spanish kid from the hood and how his hunger for fame (and i feel like some internal desperation for acceptance or something) selfishly ruined his own dreams and the lives of people he cared about and supported him. It's kinda sad in its own way but more cautionary than anything. The story will also hold your attention it was interesting,False
13,10,If you really pay attention???????,locatots,n/a,16/08/2025,"He is who he is. You are who you are
Be kind.
Its only a documentary.",False
14,10,Vikram Gandhi had an ax to grind,gdkjdndf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Vikram Gandhi definitely went into this project with an ax to grind. Throughout the interviews, you hear him throw not-so-subtle shade that he tries to disguise will feigned praise, which is ironic b/c although he claims during the prologue that he wants to know who the real Danny is, it's pretty clear that he was producing this film to gain clout from the clout maker himself.You're supposed to believe that Vikram is asking the ""hard questions,"" but all he does is pander to 69's haters. There's even a point when Shotti points out that Vikram's preoccupation with Scumgang is comical b/c Scumgang never existed, ""If Takashi saw this, he'd laugh."" This was-at best-clumsy filmmaking and at worse, it was dirty journalism.Despite Vikram's high school Slam booking, he did a great job at finding generous interviewees. Shotti fo'sure provided the most balanced perspective on Danny, where it seems like Vikram also did a good job at gathering interviewees that would paint the picture he has of the 69. Either way, the best parts of the film are when you're hearing people closest to 69 tell their stories.",False

1,9,One of the Best!,ozomatfan,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I say one of the best, I mean, obviously, Willie. But I also mean documentaries. This was an in-depth ride. Honest, and heartfelt. So many people influenced, and so many people appreciate him and you can see why in this part series there was many things I was not aware of, which made this even better than I could've imagined. And to see how many people he has helped in their careers along his way shows why it's called ""family"". He tested boundaries in his style, but never sold out. The musical journey of Mr. Willie Nelson. Is one that will last forever. I highly recommend this, no pun intended.",False
2,9,Willie Fans (and who isn't) will Love this Doc,vmvzsyfk,n/a,16/08/2025,"A wonderful documentary, chock-full of great music, big stars, like Dolly, Parton, Ray Charles. Johnny Cash, and a fascinating storyline, in which the state of Texas plays a pivotal role. Although the film was made with Willys full cooperation, it does not flinch from his marital dramas or his financial struggles. For those of us who are so used to Willy, always being part of the backdrop of our lives, it was interesting to remember that Willie did not achieve fame as an entertainer in his own right until his late 30s or early 40s. Filmmakers lucked out in that Willy was stuck at home during the pandemic, which gave them extensive access to him and his family. The result is a warm, emotional film that will have the viewer clapping and dancing to the best. . My guess is that the film will be edited slightly. Some parts, regarding his financial struggles were too long. I'm really surprised this hasn't been acquired yet because it is a gem.",False
3,7,Stellar first episode not matched by the other 3 episodes,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As Episode 1 of ""Willie Nelson & Family"" (2023 release; 4 episodes of about 50 min each) opens, we are on Willie's farm called ""Luck"", outside of Austin, TX as Willie talks about the Red Headed Stranger album. We then go back in time to Willie's upbringing and youth. Considering Willie was born in 1933, this provides a fascinating glimpse into the daily life of average (and poor) Americans. Turns out that Willie (and his sister Bobbi) were raised by their grandparents. ""They gave us love and music"", observes Willie. At that point we are 10 minutes into Episode 1.Couple of comments: let me state upfront that I am a casual Willie Nelson fac. I've seen him in concert several times over the last 15-20 years. When I think of Willie Nelson, to me he's always looked exactly the same. This documentary reminds us that in fact Willie took a long journey to end up where he did. I was entirely unfamiliar with his early output or what his background was (very humble). Episode 1 is stellar, period. The remaining episodes are pleasant enough but lack the element of surprise. There are plenty of talking heads along the way: Dolly Parton, Kenny Chesney, Sheryl Crow, Rosanne Cash, and many others. By the time we are in Episode 4, it feels like too much. Meanwhile Willie Nelson, ""like a shark"", comments a talking head, keeps moving forward, now 90+ years young. It's Willie's world, we just live in it.""Willie Nelson & Family"" started streaming on Paramount+ some time ago. I just now got around to seeing it. If you are a Willie Nelson fan, be it casual (like myself) or die-hard, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,10,Doesn't Get Any Better,tomtpcarpe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Willie fans, the merely curious, and those who haven't a clue about this American icon will enjoy watching this jewel. His story is fascinating, from his early days living with his grandparents through his struggles in Nashville to his final successes. Sure, he had some financial woes of his own making, and didn't have a lot of marital success until his last, it is all these things that make him the unique man he is. One thing that comes through in this documentary is his complete honesty, his devotion to his band, and his love for his family. The respect other superstars had (and have) for him is manifest in the number of collaborative albums and shows on his resume. And Trigger, his iconic Martin N-20, should finally rest at the Martin Museum or in the Smithsonian when the great man passes and joins the broken circle.",False
5,8,A Good Watch,pmtelefon,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a big fan of Willie Nelson. I've been listening/buying his music for decades. I listen to him almost everyday. (In fact I'm listening to ""Teatro"" as I write this.) I'm also probably the only guy who drives around Long Island (NY) with a ""Willie Nelson for President"" bumper sticker on his car. I've read pretty much every book he's ever written but I still took a lot away from ""Willie Nelson & Family"". The stuff I already knew was presented in a fresh way. The stuff that was new to me was was cool. I really enjoyed ""Willie Nelson & Family"". My only knock against it is that I wished it was three episodes instead of four. However, that has more about me and my attention span than it does about the show. The show was great.",False

1,8,"Wow,a must see and our kids too",kouts-48386,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOk, i am not from u.k and not leave there. , i am from Greece , so let's say that i dont have all the ""media background"" and gossip the British have seen.First time i learned about this girl and her isis travel it is from this film.Just to be honest, it is a very ""hard"" documentary.If you think of it clear mind ,she is just a 15 year old girl, fell for isis propaganda and with her (only) friends flew to join them.In 4 years ,she lives things we probably (i hope we will not) never lived in 30-40 years of our life. Lost 3 children etc etc.So when they critic her ,for been hard like a rock in the interview and that she not feel guilty bla bla...
Guys she is like that, because in 4 years she lost 3 kids.She doesnt care any more. She will just abandon herself if she stay at the camp and probably just die there.In this time of social media we live,this documentary should be shown to schools, so young ppl dont fall to such traps.Also the whole fiasko started by letting 3 underage travel abroad without asking parental permission at the airport. Wtf....",True
2,n/a,Fascinating,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWatching this documentary I was filled with disbelief, shock, disgust, hate and a small degree of empathy. First of all the fault of the London police must be recognized and highlighted for failing to directly inform the three families about the investigation into the missing Bethnal Green schoolgirl Shameera. Which as it turned out the three families never received the letters sent to them. They were hidden by the girls themselves.Watching Shamima in this 90 minute documentary she came across to me as someone extremely calm and collected that chose her words very carefully. This is a girl who at the age of fifteen went to Syria to join ISIS. She was married off within three weeks. And she gave birth to three babies and lost all of them, and yet she was very composed in the interview. I found her to be somewhat very detached and lacked emotions and empathy.I found it very hard to believe that she spent those years within ISIS territory and just went about as a housewife and at no time she partook in any ISIS activities, especially when a former ISIS morality policewoman said that she had seen Shamima in the training camp. All Shamima confessed to was seeing severed heads in ""bins"", and she was ""unfazed"" by what she saw.As for her situation where she has had her British citizenship revoked, that I think might be excessive. I believe she should be returned to Britain and face a trial for her actions and found guilty and be incarcerated for life in such way to ensure she cannot recruit anyone in prison.Nevertheless it was a very intriguing documentary and I recommend it.",True

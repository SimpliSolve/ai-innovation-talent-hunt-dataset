1,8,Well Crafted and Historically Correct Documentary on Lincoln,bobzmcishl,n/a,16/08/2025,"This four part documenatry about Lincoln and his military and political objectives to keep the Union together and ultimately emancipate the slaves and pass the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution is immensely entertaining and enlightening. It is also well crafted, using various photogrpahic techniques combined with narratives provided by historians with varied backgrounds. Lincoln had to weave his way through a complex set of problems, dealing with military setbacks, political pressures from abolitionists, Southern sympathizers, and citizens cool to the idea of emancipating the slaves at the expense of prolonging the Civil War. Lincoln kept an open mind, listened to intellectuals like Frederick Douglas, and finally found a general who could win battles, and provide the political capital to achieve emancipation, renunite the country, start on a path to reconstruction, and pass the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. The series also covers two other facets of the aftermath of the Civil War: the backlash against reconstruction, and rebuilding the image of the Southern insurrectionists and basically trying to rewrite the history of that period, including the building of monuments all over the South to glorify the leaders of the insurrection. This is a series that all American's should watch to get a better understanding of how the history of that era still affects us today.",False
2,10,Detailing first hand account,waqasshafiq-88236,n/a,16/08/2025,"I do not understand that viewers are not considering the fact that, this is based on actual transcripts of historical events. Not everything about dark past is a conspiracy. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it - Churchill has given a chilling reminder about this! Enjoyed this show tremendously and learned so much about our history
PS: I'm an immigrant to this beautiful Country of ours.",False
3,10,Kudos to the artists involved in making this series.,larduffy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kudos to the artists involved in making this series. The writing, animation and graphics are superb. Visually the use of the veil of lint and static on these animations and graphics effectively set the place and time. Overall a well thought out piece of work.At a point it is necessary to ""separate the wheat from the chaff"", setting apart what is true and logical from the worthless.Well written history describes what took place in the past, what it represents in the present and, with hope, can be accomplished in the future. It should be striving for an understanding of ourselves and for our neighbors.",False
4,9,I see people are butthurt over this documentary,Asianmochachip-899-256879,n/a,16/08/2025,A quick google search and reading a few books on Lincoln will confirm much of what is in the documentary. Lincoln was a complex man. He was a politician caught up in the precipice of saving the Union. What did that mean? He finally did the right thing...and emancipated the enslaved. Unfortunately the people who need to watch this won't and instead downgrade this documentary.,False
5,2,"Mostly accurate, tries too hard to contextualize 19th century from a 21st century perspective",ygsnhymfd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Realistically, showing 21st century protesters successful removal of a statue of Lincoln is a disservice to the memory of the person who was most responsible for holding the union together and ending the practice of slavery in the United States.The digs at Lincoln were strange. Frankly, Abraham Lincoln is one of the great leaders in American history and this series' message was along the lines of ""Lincoln was good but wasn't enough, his ideology was flawed''....which once again is a huge disservice to President Lincoln and is a bit obtuse because some of the people are holding him to a 21st century ethic. Abraham Lincoln was born in 1809, he died in 1865.Not you, not me, not anyone reading this; has done more to benefit the United States of America and its people in the last 160 years... this series could have given credit when it's due instead of making it seem like Lincoln should've been divine and omnipotent.",False
6,10,Brilliant,mandypearsall,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very telling that those who have written bad reviews of this brilliant production apparently feel threatened by the actual TRUTH about the civil war and that most of the contributors/narrators of Lincoln's Dilemma are Black. Seriously???? Damn those ""uppity"" realists and their perception of history. And.....just an aside-we ALL watched the footage of January 6. Unless you are delusional and/or a Trumpian nutcase we all know what really transpired that day please try to do not embarrass yourselves any longer. ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³",False
7,5,The opening scene,worthjen,n/a,16/08/2025,"To open with people at the Capitol building who were contesting the results of the 2020 election in an Abraham Lincoln documentary is out of context. It had nothing to do with Lincoln, and was inappropriate in my opinion. I'm glad I kept watching however as I did see photos and quotes I hadn't heard about Lincoln before. My rating would've been much higher if the opening scene wasn't so out of place.",False
8,10,Excellent Documentary Series!,slc6279,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is well done, educational, and illuminates a Black perspective on Lincoln and the American Civil War. I highly recommend this series, although it may be disturbing to people who have never gotten an unbiased education in history.",False
9,1,A story with an agenda,jkozarevich,n/a,16/08/2025,Many interesting facts about Lincoln and the war but underlying agenda was shown in the opening January 6 protests. The protests had nothing to do with Lincoln and degraded the content.,False
10,3,What was the economic motivation?,unshaven,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary doesn't add much to what generally is known. Though is several hours long it seems to omit the economic impact slavery had. If slavery had a value it must have been money and power. Would it be far fetched to deduce there is econimical reason why Lincoln wanted to free the slaves? Could it be this changed the power dynamic in favor of the North between the south and the north?Lest also not forget that this Unified America is built on the economical gains it made from it's slavery. Bitter as this might be.I am against slavery, racism and any abuse of humans, but also a realist. Even as I write this I realise that I am the child of the generation that came before me. And with child I mean the resulting product of the conduct of my forefathers.A weighted insight into the human, economic and impact on the future, would have made this valuable and important documentary, alas it is not.",False

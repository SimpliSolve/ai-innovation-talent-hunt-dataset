1,10,RM does knocks it out the park,mackkayla,n/a,17/08/2025,"First of all, debuting your documentary at Busan International Film Festival is incredible. Wouldn't be surprised if more idols start attempting to do this. But the film itself is wonderful. Definitely one that will be loved by all once it makes it's worldwide release. There's so much real and authenticity, which we've seen from RM before, but it's more raw this time. You do go through all the highs and lows with your emotions but it's very satisfying at the end, to have seen the end result. I am proud of what RM has achieved, especially in a short time of 9 months of filming, editing, promoting and showcasing.",False
2,10,Emotional rollercoaster,anne-marieoptekamp,n/a,17/08/2025,"I had the privilege to watch this documentary at BIFF.It was wonderful and sometimes painful to see how the making of this masterpiece unfolded.RM doesn't hold back and shares his raw emotions and deepest feelings with us.Being the genius musician he is, it seemed he had to hold back parts of himself for a long time and finally could let it all out.It was also great to see how he created the perfect team around him so he could express himself exactly the way he wanted.

3,10,SUPERB,raymondawan,n/a,17/08/2025,"Definitely not your average celebrity documentary movie. This is ART. The visual, the sound and the score...love it. A depth insight of RM on his journey making his last album before going for his military enlistment. The portray of his genuine feelings on his fame as one of BTS or solo artist and himself as Kim Namjoon. Visually satisfying and the music score very good. They might as well release an music score soundtrack album. Deserves a standing ovation for the creativity and concept, how the storyline flows eventhough it's a documentary. It's a journey. Also the music featured in the documentary was expectedly good.",False
4,10,The Essence of Kim Namjoon: A True Pioneer of Art & K-Pop,gracyjoseph-61650,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is, without a doubt, the best documentary I've ever seen. Watching it felt like connecting with Namjoon on a deeply personal level. Just like the RPWP album, the RPWP documentary is incredibly unique & profound.Words fall short of expressing how impactful this experience was for me. I watched the documentary three times, & with each viewing, I felt even closer to RM, his artistry, & the immense influence of his work.I'm so grateful that he has found a way to express his art so authentically. This documentary reaffirms why Kim Namjoon is not only the leader of BTS but also a true pioneer. He has literally paved the way for K-pop, fearlessly experimenting with genres & blending art forms.

5,10,Deep dive into RM's second solo album process,qtjjsnmqx,n/a,17/08/2025,"This was a really fascinating look into the whole journey of how RM created his second album. His creativity seems off the charts with exploring different musical genres and working with various musicians and producers. I love that he formed a Team RM to help him through the project - they looked like they were having so much fun throughout the whole process. Seeing and hearing the backstories to the music, the lyrics, the music videos, but especially the filming process to document the project was so interesting. I loved the director's decision to have filmed portions in 16mm and Super 8. The juxtaposition of the ""old-timey"" and often out-of-focus looking footage with the modern footage was really cool, even though you know the whole thing was shot over 8 or 9 months.",False
6,10,This documentary is a timeless human journey,lilianrm,n/a,17/08/2025,"RM: Right People Wrong Place is the best documentary I ever watched.

Namjoon can simply touch your heart and your soul without even trying. Riding a roller coaster of emotions with him while we are apart by oceans, was one of the the most wonderful experience of my life. Namjoon is like a philosopher and a great story teller who you want to listen to his story for the rest of your life.

7,10,RM is perfectionist,rizwanfatima-67278,n/a,17/08/2025,"Rm is a one of the best song writer, singer, producer not even that he is a great group leader.

8,10,It was a beautiful experience,erikaagg,n/a,17/08/2025,"I watched the documentary and it pleasantly surprised me. It led me to admire him, respect him. It's not the typical portrait of an idol full of ostentation, dances, and catchy songs. It's a more human work that goes beyond, showing the fragile and vulnerable side of a person like any of us. Kim Namjoon has the ability to make you reflect. It's a kind of therapy, much more than a superficial idol. It leads you to admire him not only as an artist, but also as a human being. It's a profound experience that feels like a conversation with a good friend. Now I understand why so many people connect with his music and with him. I highly recommend that you watch the documentary; you won't regret it, it's really worth it.",False

Rpwp just brings home how growing into yourself is messy. Growth is not linear, and the journey back to yourself is filled with detours and confusing crossroads. There's rage, yes. But also grace.Namjoon felt lost in the spotlights, w/ impostor sindrome at being the literal and figurative voice of a ww band, needed a little perspective & new artsy inspo. Finds a new place in the world, between dreams and reality a great bestie that knows a lot of cool people & cool places to hang out, taking not the role of a mentor but a guide. He wasn't quite ready for this wild ride, gets a little over his head, he needs a hug, a vacay & a bottle of whiskey .Rpwp is a cinematic masterpiece that's a deep-dive into ""namjoon's brain"".It was even structured in a way that you felt his journey of feeling lost to him finding his place - feeling like he's existing as himself.",False

12,10,Embodiment of self love,itxayesha,n/a,17/08/2025,"Namjoon is an embodiment of Love. No matter what he releases he would always promote self love. In his whole album, he described his journey of finally loving himself. He came to point of self love where he is in unbothered by people's remarks about himself. The song ""Lost"" is perfect discription of how sometimes we all humans feel during any stage of our life. In this song, he describes the fact that he is indeed lost, not knowing what type of person he is. But progressing towards other songs in his album, he slowly slowly accepts the fact that no matter what he is satisfied and happy with himself. Listening to this album, I feel humane and seen. He is so good at describing his feelings and emotions. Namjoon truly posseses interpersonal intelligence. He loves himself in a way that urges me to love myself too.",False

Throughout the entire film, I was overcome by various emotions from sadness, joy to all-consuming love for this man.It was amazing to experience the side of Namjoon when he is an ordinary 29 year old guy from South Korea, and not just the side when he is a world star, the leader of the group BTS. He is very real, humane with his earthly experiences, and to the same extent he is truly a worthy wonderful artist.The team that Namjoon has gathered around him is simply amazing, creative and talented people, each in their own field. I would like to thank RM and his team for such a truly heartwarming film. This is one of those rare documentaries that everyone should watch, because it will not leave anyone indifferent.",False

15,10,"Finding Growth in Discomfort: RM's Journey of Art, Healing, and Self-Discovery",Shal_7,n/a,17/08/2025,"Watching this documentary, I found myself reflecting on things. It resonated with me in many ways and reminded me of many things.My takeaway from this documentary is that growth requires discomfort, but it's also okay to rest in comfort when you need to heal. Read a lot, talk a lot, listen to all kinds of music, do weird things, open up to people, and learn about others. And most importantly, just live.One line from Kim Namjoon (RM of BTS) that stays with me: ""Don't be afraid to choose your own path. It's okay to get lost; if you make a mistake, you can always turn back.""I think even non-fans should give it a try to watch this documentary, just to give you a different perspective on an artist in the making of their art.This documentary amazes me and becomes one of my comfort movies.",False

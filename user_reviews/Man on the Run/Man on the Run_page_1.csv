1,7,informational movie,shashank-m,n/a,15/08/2025,"This shows a really high profile scam which went unseen with a lot of big figures spanning across countries and industries. The movie is informative but is not in best form of entertainment or even a good documentary. Could be taken better for cinematic effects or experience but would recommend everyone to watch the movie for sake of learning about one of the biggest scandals in recent times. When the key politicians and big name firms get inloved, everything from investigations to serving justice could be a challenge but requires the justice to renew the faith in the democratic systems. Watch for information.",False
2,7,"dirty money, dirty people",ferguson-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Remember that time you paid pop star Brittany Spears one million dollars to jump out of a birthday cake at your party? Or the times you paid huge appearance fees to celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, and Paris Hilton to hang around your lavish parties? If not, then you're no Jho Low. And thank goodness for that. Jho Low was in cahoots with then Prime Minister Najib Razak to siphon billions from a fund designed to assist Malaysian citizens. Their fund was called 1MDB (1 Malaysian Development Berhad) and thanks to researchers and whistleblowers, this film from Cassius Michael Kim lays out a textbook case of corruption, fraud, and greed.The FBI have called this the largest kleptocracy case to date. Kleptocracy is defined as corrupt government officials embezzling funds for personal gain. And yes, that is the where the billions of dollars come in, however, in this day and age, celebrities must be involved for the general public to much care. To satisfy these viewers, the montage of associated celebrities is impressive, and the use of these funds to finance Martin Scorsese's Oscar nominated film, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2014), may provide the perfect example of irony. Government corruption funding a film highlighting Wall Street corruption. To top it off, that scenario is then used as the basis for a documentary focused on the two key players behind this conspiracy of fraudulent activity.In addition to Jho Low, Prime Minister Najib Razak, and the celebs, the story also involves Najib's wife, the FBI, Goldman Sachs executives, and numerous other folks who got caught up in the web of greed. Wherever there is dirty money being spent, you can be assured there are dirty people involved. Filmmaker Kim allows many to communicate their perspectives and observations on Jho Low, though the reality is that he remains a somewhat mysterious figure. An enigma who, while conspiring with the head of a country, managed to live the high life by spending money bilked from Malaysians.A 22-carat diamond ended up with the Prime Minister's wife, and both of them got what they deserved in the end. However, the newest game of ""Where's Waldo?"" is now called, ""Where's Jho Low?"" He is the titular man on run, while others pay the price ... including a country that teetered on financial failure. The director does include an interview with the former Prime Minister, and we do hear from others who are familiar with the case. Unfortunately, none of the celebrities who accepted the fees agreed to appear on camera, either due to shame or fear of self-incrimination. Still, there is plenty of slime on display.In select theaters beginning September 22, 2023.",False
3,5,The trick with these sorts of things ...,mformoviesandmore,n/a,15/08/2025,... is to make them interesting.Unfortunately this one fails. It is a complete flop.It is made even worse by the awful drowning soundtrack.People won't care about this movie and in that way it mirrors how people don't care about what happened.The story could have been told in 15-30 mins.Here we just get endless padding of mournful soundtrack and people making comments which don't add to the story.I'd suggest you just use Google to get a summary of events and save yourself the time to watch it. Certainly.don't extend the financial losses by spending money on a ticket.The long list of people who chose not to participate - did so wisely.,False
4,7,Good Introduction,atleverton,n/a,15/08/2025,"To one of the biggest financial scandals of recent times. It does a good job of introducing the players, and explaining what happened. I have two observations. The first is that the audacity that some people have, you are caught red handled stealing money from the country you were elected to lead and you blame other people? Shameless. The other observation that I have is about the practice of paying celebrities to attend your parties. So basically if you have enough money you can pay pretty much whoever you want to show up, it doesn't matter what shady or immoral things you might be up to. It's a bizarre world.",False
5,8,$681 million was resting in the PM's bank account!,Pairic,n/a,15/08/2025,"Man on the Run: Great documentary about the IMDB scandal. Corruption at the highest levels across the globe. The film tells the tale of the ongoing 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal and the involvement of former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak and the fugitive businessman, Jho Low in a scandal that shook Malaysia. Razak was sentenced to 12 years in prison, $681 million was resting in his account. He likely got away with murder though, an official from the Attorney General's office was found dead in an oil barrel. The official had signed a warrant for the arrest of Razak while he was still in power. Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Paris Hilton, The Fugees, Kim Kardashian, Goldman Sachs et al were also involved in this affair. The conman Jho Low is still on the run. Enormously entertaining. Directed, written and executive produced by Cassius Michael Kim. On Netflix. 8/10.",False
6,2,Huge amount of superfluous long scenes,Danviewer,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe movie positions itself as a DocuDrama. DocuDramas have a general script of chronologically illustrating how the events progressed. Unfortunately, this movie kept enumerating countless examples of depraved and perverted behaviors of various celebrities.It's ok to drive the point that celebrities were head over heal with Jho Low, but to keep coming back to this point over and over again is distracting from the main theme.Worse yet, the movie is a disjoined set of events, hodgepodged to attempt to make a poor story telling.The director needs to learn from other famous docudrama producers and directors to acquire the necessary knowledge to make such movies.I gave it 2 stars because it does have some semblance of history, but not enough to capture my attention to the end. I found many 1MDB youtube documentaries much better made and information than this waste of time.",True
7,10,Breaking the Big Bits into Digestible Parts,dvjtt-39939,n/a,15/08/2025,Love the narrative and how it ties back to how this affects the everyday lay people from hawkers to illiterate rural Malaysians. The 1MDB fiasco seemed hidden behind clouds of financial jargons and conspiracy when the news first broke but the documentary did an amazing job explaining how this came to be and why nobody knew all the details behind it. Perfect for people who have no extensive knowledge about business/finance workouts as this documentary breaks difficult concepts and illustrated them into very digestible pieces. Highly recommended for all Malaysians to build understanding of this turbulent times.,False
8,2,"Misleading trailer, tons of overproduced fluff",Vic_W123,n/a,15/08/2025,"The trailer seemed interesting. That this would be an exciting documentary about a ""Man on the Run"" (aka Jho Low), who stole a billion dollars and used it to fund an extravagant lifestyle full of parties with rich people and celebrities. Only problem is, it isn't that at all. The trailer is basically just scenes taken from the first 5 minutes and then for the rest of the documentary, Jho Low is only talked about sporadically as a connection point for a number of other shady characters.You know when a teacher would give you a minimum word count but you were 200 words short at the end of an essay so you would add fluff in there to make it longer even though it added no value? Well that's what this felt like. The documentary could have been about 60 minutes instead of 98 minutes and it would have been substantially better. The creators would drag out their creepy artwork(?) shots for 30 seconds instead of moving on to the next scene.In the end it's not a documentary I would recommend to anyone, which is sad because it's an interesting topic.",False
9,10,Hollywood dreams and corrupt schemes,bkcinephile,n/a,15/08/2025,"Financial malfeasance is certainly noxious, but as subject matter for a doc film runs the risk of being pedantic or procedural. Man On The Run deftly weaves the facts and faces of the 1MDB scandal into a pacey, emotional, (but still dense) narrative. A mostly charismatic and sympathetic cast of characters tells the story, and the filmmakers manage to get some of the bad guys in too. The film also surprises with a great dose of humor and levity. The Malaysian subjects particularly bring a lot of heart and warmth to the film. Creative visuals capture the flavor and rhythms of the region, and the soundtrack really shines. I was able to see the film on the big screen and enjoyed it from start to finish. Kudos.",False
10,3,As If We Don't Know Stars Get Paid To Do Appearances?,PalmBeachG,n/a,15/08/2025,"Man On The Run uses celebrities as the hook to get you to watch this expose on a name you would never recognize otherwise. It's common knowledge that celebs get paid for appearances so big deal. They don't know where every dollar comes from people they are acquainted with for gosh sake. As far as the man ""on the run"" part of the story and the fraud he committed - it's a web of corruption and politics at the highest level but a rather boring story overall IMO. It actually put me to sleep 3 times and came back in the morning to finish it. Doesn't say much for such a short documentary or story. One thing I did learn from it though is who the man is that is on the run - will remember the name now Jho Low, which by the way sounds like a fake name anyway, If I hear it discussed in a social setting at least I will know who and what is being discussed, so I will give it that which is what my 3 stars are for.#JhoLow

11,10,"Impressive Story, Insane Characters, Very Well Done",krunner224,n/a,15/08/2025,"An impressive look under the hood of how fraud at the highest levels of government was staged and then pulled off, ""Man on the Run"" is both impressive for its access and storytelling.How two people brazenly stole hundreds of millions of dollars from their own country, flaunted it publicly, and even got so far as funding the Martin Scorsese film, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", which was ABOUT CORRUPTION -was as baffling as it was fascinating.But beyond the villains - the story also did a fantastic job of illustrating the cost. The financial burden they put on an entire country for their actions juxtaposed with the everyman's desire to just be able to live was beautiful, heartbreaking, and ultimately a very strong call to action for accountability.Absolutely worth the watch, and a VERY relevant film no matter where you're from.",False
12,8,Netflix vs The Fat Man,KentaroGod,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerFirst and foremost kudos to those who put up all the information pertaining to the case of IMDb which took more than a decade long to unravelYes initially I felt It was a exaggerated but we can see the whole new version that felt neglected by the nation how disgraceful Malaysia was put on the map link to corruption size second to none and what saddens me was from the interview we can see the hardcore poor citizen does not even knew the cases at allWe can witness a lot of the people involved are reluctant to participate in the making of this docu dramaOf course by watching you tubes video is more educational and more informative then the movie aboveBear in mind that Netflix needs to make money too.It is truly an eye opener for a lot of audiences about a beautiful and rich country only to be destroyed by a corruption scandalWatch it whole .. rate it yourselves. Hopefully when the man is not on the run we can see a second chapter coming along.,True
13,8,Horrifying,blanche-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat a disgusting and depressing story.The sad thing about Malaysia having development funds stolen by the Prime Minister and this Jho-low character is that this goes on everywhere - and we all suffer. Look at all the money that Hamas took from Gaza.To thing that those crooks at Goldman Sachs are still in business is appalling. And let me see- $671 million in the private bank account of the Prime Minister - oh, a Saudi prince gave him that money with no strings. Then where's all the fund money?Meanwhile he's giving his wife a $27 million diamond, Jho-low pays $250,000 to come to his parties - the ones that spray Cristal - finances Wolf of Wall Street and then escapes to the Arctic Circle in his $250 million ice-breaking yacht so he can't go on trial.Meanwhile Malaysia continues to be an undeveloped country.People, wake up. These kleptocrats are stealing your future and your children's. Get some education and start voting.",True

1,6,Shocking Series,itriatay995,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched Black Coast Vanishings by chance, and I was shocked to watch this documentary series. You know if it were not New Zealand, I would not be this shocked. 6 people (3 men and 3 women) disappeared from Piha, New Zealand, within 30 years. Yes, 30 years! Nevertheless, there are no clues whether these mysterious disappearances involve any foul play. I have always thought that New Zealand is a safe country and the criminal justice system works much better compared to other countries in the world. Nevertheless, this series shows that there are a bunch of criminals who are hanging around the streets without any proper investigation. It makes you think that there is no will to act! This was indeed shocking to watch. Finally, I did not like that the director mixed each case with another without a time frame. Still, watch it and you will be surprised.",False
2,5,"Stunning cinematography, sad stories, hold the conspiracies",madamejem-27311,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBeautifully shot programme.Absolutely stunning cinematography.I struggle with the story line, which links stories of people who have disappeared at Piha in what seems to be very different sets of circumstances.I find beauty & respect in a rugged beach and have generations of family who have found community, peace, sport & recreation at Piha.I don't think the development of this show is fair.What are they trying to showcase?Promote?Divide?As a platform for grieving families I understand it may be an outlet to connect and share very sad moments in their lives.As a lover of the beach and community at Piha it falls short.",True

1,8,Great show (minus the alpha obsession),tabnabber,n/a,16/08/2025,"This chimp is ""the alpha"", you'll hear 5 million times as the show repeatedly attempts to force all the chimps into a manmade ordered hierarchy.The concept of alpha males is considered outdated in the context of animal behavior, as it oversimplifies the complexity of social structures and hierarchies. Modern understanding emphasizes cooperation, flexibility, and the diversity of social roles in both animals and humans.Ignoring the controversial alpha theory this is a great show for all ages, showcasing the lives, personalities, and relationships of rescued lab chimps in the world's largest chimp sanctuary.",False
2,10,"So interesting, funny, heartwarming",JasonBelle,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely loved Meet the Chimps. Educational, extremely interesting, funny, well narrated and filmed. They seem to be doing such good work there, and watching them interact with and discuss the various colonies and personalities of the residents is deeply satisfying. Really hope Disney is all systems go for additional seasons.",False

1,8,Unbalanced but compelling,whatgift,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was ready to hate this, not being a fan of that style of music and initially it seemed that the doco was essentially glamorising criminals.While they are indeed criminals, they are trying to better their situation and turn their lives around, and trying to give hope to their communities.The style of music lyrically is somewhat controversial, and it's clear that Australian police don't get it. This doco has at least got cooperation and involvement from the police, but presents it in such a way that is in itself unfair - while the police's actions are undoubtedly heavy handed, it is not unfounded since they are dealing with criminals. Bringing the race argument into the discussion also seems unnecessary, and just distracts from the narrative.In the end, it's a compelling story, told well but mostly from one perspective. You can feel a real empathy with the group members, and really hope for them to succeed, whether you like their music or message.",False
2,10,Fascinating,sophiestargirl,n/a,16/08/2025,This sucked me right in. They have a new fan! Can't believe the police power that got put into them! Do the white Aussie rappers get the same treatment????Other than that it was great account of their lives and trying to succeed. Music should not be banned or silenced.Story telling is what we do. I loved how these boys from western Sydney put that in music. Yes they have shady past and grew up in rough area. But them breaking out and being recognised shows kids as well that there is more in life.I mainly wanted to come complain about the police pressure. That made me mad. I'm all for police but not when it's always on POC and disadvantaged areas. Put support and finance into those areas!Proud of these guys using there creativity and voice.You have a new fan.,False
3,10,"Honest, Raw and Real",jiordybabe,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is amazing. Personally, I'd seen them live at a festival 2 years ago and didn't know a lot. This was an insight and made me think twice. The message was clear and I think they should be nothing but proud of this. I hope it reaches people and questions their thinking - must watch for sure.You can see the clear divide between people who have remained on the picket fence side of life and the everyday people just trying to make it. Sometimes people forget empathy and the biggest takeaway is that the NSW police are out of touch with reality and need a scapegoat. They should probably start looking towards real issues because one four isn't what they make it out to be.",False
4,1,So many unanswered questions,pigsrings,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBut did any of you not see that guy laying on the ground in the pub with 3 men stomping their feet onto his head?? Plus 3 out of the 4 one four members have served time in gaol for gang related violence.Sydney was getting out of control. That's the only reason the police created new laws to be able to better deal with the violence. They didn't have any power to deal with it that's why the laws were created.And sure EX gang members deserve a second chance. These guys should get a second change IF they have really left all their criminal activities behind them.I want to know what grounds the police had their final search warrant for, you don't get a search warrants just for s&8ts and giggles. And also was the final act stopped or was the searching by the police done after One Four performed. The ending was very rushed and seemed to be brushed over. Hmmm.",True
5,10,Even if you're not a fan of the music,kaneo-09105,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWorth a watch for sure, shows the opression and struggles of people who offend yet try and change their lives. Isn't the prison system meant to be about reabilitation? The documentary is eye opening to the views of a minority in power, one of the biggest gangs in Australia and they all wear blue.Let them grow, even if you don't like their music. They served time and paid for the mistakes. The ones that didn't go to jail still ended up struggling because of the cops.Hope this Netflix documentary stops or reduces the police presence, what a waste of tax payers money. They even had the cops side included in the doco and yet they still looked incompetant with a chip on their shoulder.In saying this the Kid Laroi has got to be an unofficial onefour member, big respect.",True
6,10,"Great insight, great story",tristanlinds-40199,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a pretty important doco for all Australians, and also non Australians to see. Amazing insight on these lads growing up in Western Sydney, and into how the Australian police force enforces censorship.Shows a harsh reality of friends growing up in the rougher parts of Australia, then discovering music and using it to tell their stories in a raw form, why? Because that was their reality. Music should make you feel something, and ONEFOUR's absolutely does. But powers that be don't like people expressing themselves if it doesn't conform to their ideals.They were no angels but don't deserve the treatment they have received and continue to receive from NSW police, when they are trying to better their lives and tell their story.",False
7,10,Enjoyed getting to know Sydney's realest,maddyjdwyer,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed watching this documentary. Great storytelling. I hadn't really heard of Onefour prior to watching this (they are drill rappers from the outer suburbs of Sydney). This documentary touches on interesting insights into the music scene in Australia, police abuse of power and life in Western Sydney. It has interviews with a wide range of voices, including members of Onefour and their families, NSW Police and people in the music industry. Also fun to see some well known people like the Kid Laroi speak about the group and their journey. This film is definitely a must watch for anyone interested in Australian hip hop.",False
8,10,"Highly recommended! Balanced, compelling, and touching. Was not aware of drill or Onefour but I want them to succeed!",mosesberewulf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very interesting look into a music group who represent a community in Australia that are apparently not welcomed by mainstream media, police, or the establishment. If you enjoy contemporary art, music, and culture this is for you. It is also a revealing insight into how far Australia has ventured into empowering Police to infringe upon civil liberties. Shocking. Overall a balanced and well produced documentary. My only wish is that it would be even better if they explored the creative or recording process more - perhaps in the follow up?Recommended viewing, it has got me interested in finding out more.",False
9,10,Shows the real Australians,alreupena,n/a,16/08/2025,"Totally agree with the movie. Being a Samoan myself, I had my fair share of dealings with the police. 25 years ago, Ipswich in the western suburbs of Brisbane, is a different place compared to it now. Lots of racism from Police to teachers at both primary and high school. We were labelled ""gangs"" and were only 13 years old lol I really hope one four overcome their adversary.So many white Australians who have done far worst, including terrorism to drug trafficking, are aloud to write a book about what they did and make money out of it. Yet, one four are banned to perform which allows them to bring income for them and their families. Talk about basic human rights violation. Mind you, Australia violates basic human rights laws everyday. But, everyday Australians do not know that their Australian Gov do it.So their goal is to fizzle one four out to get them back into the trouble that they're trying to get out of....? Yet, NSW gov does not invest in those disadvantage communities to make it better, but make the communities turn on each other?This movie really show how and who Australians really are. I experience it myself. I hear horror stories from tourists who visit australia.",False
10,10,An engaging and insightful documentary,guyinaghillesuit,n/a,16/08/2025,"An enlightening and engaging documentary exploring the experiences of a young rap group who have brushed with the law.As an Australian citizen, watching these young people try to escape a life of crime through the arts and being oppressed using archaic anti organised crime laws brings a real fire to my mind. I recommend a watch whether you're a fan of the music or not. Watching as the police repeatedly overreach as a method of crushing freedom of speech shows how backwardly conservative Australia really is leaves this viewer with a stony heart.At the end of the first viewing my mind recalls growing up in western Sydney, how the common criminal elements were restricted to drug use and domestic violence, as well as concerning rhetoric around sexual consent. This film acts as an astounding criticism and in many ways is a stark display of Sydney's complete and utter sledgehammer approach to policing and leaves the viewer wondering, why do the police never speak of tangible plans to engage with their communities.A must watch.",False
11,10,Must-see viewing,wordsworkartworks,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brilliant, well-structured documentary about racism, retaliation and redemption through music. It should be mandatory viewing for all. It's multi-layered: cultural, social, legal, political, and has generated a lot of discussion with friends. Was a real eye-opener about the boys, the music and the challenges they face. Everyone deserves another chance, to flourish and to make an honest living from doing what they love. So much respect for the resilience the boys have demonstrated. Never give up.Police money would be better spent building bridges between the youth and police - set up music studios in PCYCs, etc - do something positive and constructive for better outcomes all round.Score 11/10.",False
12,n/a,"9,9",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wauw. If you have any interest in social issues or the music industry in general, this is a must watch. I don't think I've ever felt so frustrated and angry after watching a doc while also being inspired at the same time. The documentary depicts the struggles the Samoan community face on a day to day in Syndey. Is shows how they find music as an outlet for their battlescars and trauma. It shows how police, fueled by fear and a lack of empathy tries to portray these young men and their art as the root of all crime in Sydney. This all whilest their art is the one thing that is strengthening their community and giving a sprinkle of hope to their youth. It depicts the mental toughness these guys possess, thanks to their love for their family, community and their art. Absolute warriors that deserve to be seen by the world!✊🏽",False

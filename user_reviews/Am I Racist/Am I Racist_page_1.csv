1,8,Great Dive into the Racism Controversy,ingodwetrust-58966,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a fan of Matt Walsh's since i watched ""What is a Woman"" and this movie was just as good in my opinion. It's definitely not for everyone. It definitely exposes what's going on in the world today with everyone calling everyone else racist which a lot of people are profiting from. Some of the moments in this movie can seem a little long at times, but not too bad. There were also a few moments in the movie where I was just wondering how there can be people like this in the US. How Matt Walsh kept a straight face while making this movie is amazing. If you are curious or not about watching this movie, just go see it.",False
2,8,It's a Good Start,tfurmato,n/a,16/08/2025,"My biggest complaint about the movie was that it was too short. It could easily have been 15-30 more minutes, and covered more conversations. The amount that was payed out to some of the activists was so outlandish, it's a shame we couldn't get more content from their interaction. Maybe even a litttle behind the scene action too. Daily Wire could easily come out with a second movie to this, with a lot of that content in it, and it would still be interesting to watch.The premise of Matt going on a journey was fitting, and it all works. The laughs were deep and plentiful. He artfully exposes the pushers of racism, who claim anti-racism.",False
3,8,7 quality 8 for relevance,contacttedjohnson,n/a,16/08/2025,We laughed more than I expected and the commentary really was not provocative. The documentary does a good job of showing not telling and the unifying overall message is exactly what we need these days. Glad to have someone call out the racism and division being spread under the guise of DEI. The movie is heads and shoulders better than any of the other daily wire films and I would happily watch it again and recommend to everyone I know. I think that even people that don't Share the producer's worldview can appreciate the social commentary and the fact that he seems to only punch up not down. The people that he confronts negatively are people specifically trying to spread here and division and making money on it can't picture a more worthy endeavor in filmmaking.,False
4,9,Brilliantly sarcastic take on the racism and hate industry,rutledgech,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the first movie in a long time where the arguments being presented are so absurd - so logically cork screwy -that laughter rolled through the cinema. There are horrible racist acts happening in our society - but the conclusion that our society is racist to the core, or that we are all racists, is bunkum. This film sets out to show the DEI industry (and cult) in all its intellectual shoddiness.The skill of this film is to depict exactly the absurdity of these ideas.Walsh is a remarkably skilled actor - wins the Borat award for straight faced interviews with people tying themselves up in absurd arguments. There are so many scenes that begin with a grave and seriously proposed premise...that then get taken by the 'white guilt/society is totally racist' workshop and TV show crowd to total farce.A broader theme - brilliantly presented and established - is the degree to which we, as a society, have become a herd of grazing sheep, digesting whatever the media (of any type or any ideological leaning) present to us as ""expert"" information. The film is a must see as to how we are all being manipulated unless we keep our critical thinking skills in shape.",False
5,10,Hilarious movie. Well worth the watch and everyone should see it.,invisible_mango,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is excellent. My wife and I saw it over the weekend, and we haven't laughed this much in a long time at the theatre. We both thought it was hilarious.On top of that it is also enlightening and gives you a glimpse inside the world of DEI and systemic racism along with those who profit from it. Eye opening. I feel like everyone should watch this movie.It's also great to watch it in theatres because watching it with a crowd is just enhances the experience. Everyone was laughing the whole time.I don't want to give any spoilers at all because it's worth it to see it all unspoiled. Many of the situations that Matt Walsh finds himself in have to be seen to be believed.Fantastic watch and well worth the price of admission, and I'm far happier to spend my hard earned money on a movie like this than many other movies coming out of Hollywood these days.",False
6,6,"Almost There, But Too Obvious",buteea,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had high hopes for Am I Racist? After seeing the trailer, and while the film had some genuinely funny moments, it didn't fully meet my expectations. Matt Walsh did let the other side talk, and in many cases, they exposed themselves quite a bit. However, I think the film could have gone even deeper if Walsh had taken a more subtle approach. Many of the questions and comments he made sounded pretty much exactly like what they were: A right-wing person trying trying to pretend to Take on a left wing view of race relations.Throughout the mockumentary, it was clear that people were suspicious of him-often because his satirical comments were obvious, and this put them more on guard than they probably would have been if he had asked more genuine, open-ended questions that were worded in a manner more in line with how they actually think.One such moment was when Walsh interviewed Robin DiAngelo. By presenting contradictions in her thinking in a 'confused' and inquisitive tone, he managed to highlight the flaws without being overly confrontational or raising much suspicion. If the film had maintained this kind of subtle questioning throughout, I think it would have been even more effective in exposing the contradictions in modern discussions on race. As it stands, the film feels like it missed an opportunity to dig deeper and reach a wider audience by over-relying on obvious satire. I predict that it will fall short of reaching or affecting people who do not already stand on the same side of the discussion as Matt Walsh.It's still worth watching if you enjoy political satire, but I think it could have been stronger with a more nuanced approach.",False
7,5,Lack of Direction,TheKeeMaker,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie would have been much better if Matt stuck to being himself. It wasn't necessary to play a character who drops plates and says random things which don't apply to the scene. This film had great potential but felt a bit haphazard in its approach, there could have been much more thought given to where the interviews would go and what the point of them would be. At times, for example the story of the alleged racist mascot, the film opens lines of thought which never actually go anywhere. As a viewer, you expect Matt to find out the truth behind the mascot story, or at least attempt to but, no, the thread thats opened up is dropped and the film moves on to something totally different. I really wanted this to be better than it was. Still worth a watch.",True
8,7,Worthy of a Review,scryptkeeper-09126,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Am I Racist?"" is an amusing documentary that features Matt Walsh on a largely whimsical journey to educate himself on the in's and out's of racial discrimination.As far as the comedic elements were concerned, the humor was witty and well-placed; serving as both an adept tool for moving the plot along and extra icing in terms of the overall presentation.The story (though intentionally hyperbolic in nature) was more coherent and streamlined than most $100,000,000+ movies that have fallen by the wayside in recent years, and the through-line message was spot on.For entertainment value alone, the film is worthy of a review. Moreover, it's a thorough presentation for those looking to learn a thing or two about one of the greatest modern blights few are willing to address.",False
9,5,Potentially cutting satire undermined by Walsh's dumb clowning,arcweldx,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAm I Racist? Is Matt Walsh and the Daily Wire's follow-up to the documentary What is a Woman?, their satirical critique of transgender ideology. What is a Woman? Succeeded because Walsh simply let gender experts and activits talk freely. No jokes, just honest listening with some insightful but straight-faced questions. It was the experts and activists who made a mockery of themselves and revealed the incoherence and intolerance of their beliefs. Funny, troubling...and honest.Am I Racist? Might have succeeded if they'd followed the same formula. Take the centrepiece of the documentary, Race to Dinner, where DEI consultants Saira Rao and Regina Jackson are invited to berate a group of white women about their racism as they all enjoy an expensive meal. The ridiculousness of the situation is the stuff of high comedy and I would have loved to hear the whole conversation. Sadly, we hear little of it. Matt Walsh, channeling Borat, crashes the scene disguised as a waiter, interrupts the speakers with his own dumb comments, does stupid slapstick like dropping plates. What could have been a roast of ""anti-racist"" lunacy is actively undermined by the clowning which takes centre stage.There's much material to mine when it comes to the excesses of the DEI industry but so little appears in Am I Racist? The treatment of the subject matter comes across as generally lazy. Another example is the ""racist"" blow-up involving a theme park animal character ignoring two black girls. The real story may not be as it seems, but instead of doing actual investigation they just take the cheap shot of paying the girls' mother $50K for an interview, implying that she was a grifter for being motivated by money. But who wouldn't take $50K??All in all, a lazy effort with too little substance. The moments of real potential for satire are undermined by taking the focus away from the subjects to Walsh's Borat-style clown act.",True
10,9,Comedic documentary.,lbslukas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Am I Racist?The film explores the varied approaches to that question and what it means to be Anti-racist. From talking to Anti-racist experts to patrons from a southern biker bar, many different viewpoints are on display.Matt Walsh takes his deadpan humor and gets his DEI certification to meet with people like Robyn DeAnglo (White Fragility), and other voices behind the Anti-racist movement.The film exposes the amount of money Anti-racists get paid from the people trying to become anti-racist. There are a few people on the street/ biker bar that share their thoughts on race and racism in America, that was enjoyable.There are some really hilarious scenes and some good chuckles through out.A recommended watch.",False
11,6,"80% Cringe, 20% hilarious",jonathanbroomhead,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ok, here's the thing, this movie is a comedy. Matt Walsh's demeanor throughout the film is over the top and cringey. It's because this is supposed to be a comedy even though it does expose some of the ridiculous characters driving the DEI movement.As a comedy, a lot of the movie wasn't like super funny. Definitely cringey, but not usually in a funny way. As an expose on the drivers of the DEI movement, it also wasn't great. However, there were 1-2 moments that had me absolutely dying of laughter. They weren't the over the top moments either. Once or twice Matt made an off handed comment or gesture that had me dying in laughter.It's worth a watch, but don't expect much.",False
12,5,Dude needs to let people talk,bigbadbassface,n/a,16/08/2025,"So much of what the interviewees are saying is ridiculous and they talk themselves in circles. They make outrageous statements about inherent white supremacy, and draw so many invisible lines it's honestly sad. The fact that people pay to go to seminars to talk about how evil they are is so so sad on its own.For whatever reason that's not enough for this guy. He's constantly trying to make jokes (that never land) then repeats them over and over. The intent is clearly to make everyone feel uncomfortable
But it totally takes away from the impact of what he's trying to prove.It's sad because this could have been an amazing and impactful mockumentary, but instead ends up boring. My grandmother used to say you have to ears and one mouth for a reason, and this guy needs to learn that lesson.",False
13,10,Epic!,Illustriousfuel,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the best films of the last 20 years! I can't wait for more movies from him 👍 I suggest that everyone I know, and everyone they know, go see this movie. I felt like I was right there with him on every step of his journey. It's an inspirational piece of art. We should honestly all go see it twice... nay, thrice! Be a part of one of the greatest new movement in moving picture film, I truly believe this masterpiece will be a historical hit, and I also believe everyone could learn some amazing things from watching this film. Please view responsibly, may cause sudden shift in opinions and perspective 👍 party on Wayne!",False
14,10,Brilliant,oldfinds-16025,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's plain brilliant how Matt Walsh manages to navigate the world of hypocrisy . I love how he connects to simple people black and white, without any gaslighting from the so called media ..hard working Americans or motorists.In the end it's all about money, so as long as the issue brings plenty they will do and say anything. Walsh is hilarious how he gets in to groups at first giving a false name .I wonder, how in the world those seeking therapy for thens of thousands of dollars managed to recognize him? Walsh is not on each of the nation public TV or news networks, first page... but they did.I loved his first movie ""What is a woman"" and I had to see this one as well. I am glad I did, a refreshing angle of today topics , otherwise frustrating, upsetting and in the end false .",False
15,6,"Good message, questionable approach",jwag777,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the last five minutes of the movie, Walsh finally spells out the point of the prior hour and forty minutes. A point that I happen to agree with. But I would have to question the method he used to get to that point. Walsh basically made light of the topic he was addressing, racism, which is all good and fun, but it won't change the minds of the radical anti-racist folks he had on and interviewed in the film. In fact, it'll probably make them more vigilant, which I'm not sure was Walsh's intention.Stunningly, Walsh, who is a terrible actor, and his obviously fake wig evidently tricked the likes of ultra extreme anti-racist advocates like Robin DiAngelo, Regina Jackson, and Saira Rao to where they actually let him film them for this documentary. Which completely eludes me, except for the fact that they were paid handsomely to be on it, which Walsh makes no bones in pointing out. In fact, the money these and other anti-racist people make to talk and teach on the subject is definitely eye-opening, and makes you question their real motivation. And that was certainly one of Walsh's objectives here.But as a conservative-leaning person, I'm not sure I can recommend this film. The disguised anti-Matt Walsh was irritating at times, and to me not very funny, although he was supposed to be. He didn't ask several obvious questions I had that I would have asked these people. Plus he made light of the subject too much. I think a more straight forward point approach would have been more affective. There were also two group sessions, one that the real Matt attended and one the anti-Matt taught, that I couldn't tell whether were legit or staged. That's never good. So I'm on the fence about this film. Good message, questionable approach.",False
16,2,Matt Walsh just got in the way and was annoying,MovieWatcher906,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was embarrassed watching this movie. Do i agree with the DEI craziness? No!Matt had a couple of decent back/forth situations when he indirectly pointed out the no win, craziness of their scenario play outs. But, for the most part, Matt was just RUDE and seemed like an attention starved adolescent. It could have been satirical and comical in a way that didn't make you feel like his point of view was just lost in the barrage of stupidity.I really walked away from this movie thinking it was a spoiled opportunity. Now, i will admit that i am not familiar with Matt Walsh and his style of comedy, and maybe I should have known what to expect if I knew anything ahead of time about Matt Walsh.",False
17,9,More Mock than Doc but cleverly done.,harmonybee-92668,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is good for a combination of reasons.It does an outstanding job of highlighting the business of racism in the west and all it's contradictions and hypocrisy, in some truly hilarious ways. At other times, it does so in the most embarrassing and saddening ways, reiterating that there are some truly delusional people in exceptionally powerful positions dictating what we should be thinking and how we should be viewing eachother.Matt Walsh is a controversial figure. I don't agree with all of his views, however, I do agree with a lot of what he and his team are attempting to spotlight in this docufilm. I feel as if they could have used the run time a little more wisely to educate the audience more instead of spending around two thirds of the film making fun of certain institutions and individuals viewpoints, despite how funny it is to watch.Overall, I think this film is great. It's so honest and refreshing to see.The last decade has seen a steady increase in what is essentially tyrannical behaviour masquerading as activism in order to have people respond emotionally and therefore being much easier to influence and control.There a plenty of moments in this film that demonstrate that your average people just want to get by without conflict. We don't want to be pulled into arguments we never started, we don't want to be force-fed retoric we don't agree with and we do not want mass media's hate fuled war.Well done Matt Walsh and Co.",False
18,6,Matt Walsh is not funny or stupid,jfo-95056,n/a,16/08/2025,"In What is a Woman Matt Walsh played Matt Walsh, the everyman, whose sarcasm is neatly wrapped in pretend curiosity. And it works. In Am I Racist, he changes the formula. Now he's playing a character: a do-gooder numbskull klutz. (The dumb version of those he means to satirize).Like Borat before him, he's embodying the very joke he means to expose. Even the film's voiceover is in-character, guiding us through this imbecile's faux arc. Unfortunately for him and us - and I don't think he'd be too offended by this point - Matt Walsh is not Sasha Baron Cohen. All politics aside. SBC is an extremely funny dude. And comedically savvy enough to appeal to both sides of the isle. I'm not sure why Walsh decided to go explicitly for laughs - particularly ones that stem from his character's mild antics - being clumsy, unremarkably awkward, interrupting - whereas any viewer of his knows that the laughs he creates most often come from him pointing out the antics of his targets. And he does so by being a strong and relentless arguer, not a brilliant satirist. Throughout the film Walsh's usually dependable practicality and occasional wit seem stifled by a nagging sense that he should try to be funny.There are moments: shout out to the carjacking the next car joke.I wonder why the argument of this film had to be anchored in satire? I understand his targets are probably worthy, maybe even deserving of it, but unfortunately they - like Walsh - never do anything particularly outrageous or funny. And because it's going for laughs, its thesis and insight (and entertainment value) are only highlighted if the scenarios they create are in fact funny. Surely just as many (or more) laughs (and insights!) could've come from playing it straight - which is resoundingly and on many levels Walsh's wheelhouse.Even in his piece de la resistance interview with RDA I found myself wishing he'd release himself from the chains of this character, the burden of going for laughs, and just have a pointed conversation (or interrogation) with her. I expect that would've been hysterical.",False
19,4,Expected a lot but was ..... quite boring!,a_jana,n/a,16/08/2025,The movie is so simplistic it seems to have been made for a very naive audience with an one track mind. The director has made no honest attempt to understand the nuances of the arguments he does not like. The entire humor seems to be based on mockery - the laziest form. I expected much more reading the description but got so little. Matt has not really made any obvious arguments except the commercialization of a concept which happens in each and every walk of life - including education. That does not mean we bash education as a necessary societal tool.I have seen some great documentaries - this one was a really ordinary one.,False
20,7,A movie everyone should see,gijoe-48397,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I'm at least peripherally aware of Matt Walsh and what this movie was about, I wasn't exactly raring to go see him expose ideological grifters. When rumblings started about how funny it was, I raised an eyebrow. I couldn't see myself being anything more than annoyed and angry about these idiots. I am pleased to admit, I was wrong. Matt and the team behind this film were able to communicate a satirical journey Matt goes through regarding intersectional identity politics. He never confronts anyone; he just lets them talk (for a fee of course, which he shows) and prompts logical/fair questions that reveal who these people truly are and how their 'ideas' are nothing more than a grift for power and money. It's not without flaws. Some of the humor is that 'cringe' material that will turn many off, but it's thankfully minimal. The 'story' feels tacked on as an excuse to string the documentary together rather than anything of substance. Not a deal breaker, but don't expect great writing here. Finally, I feel Matt could've gone harder acknowledging racism isn't gone and may have just changed targets. Overall, I recommend this to everyone. It's not Matt or Daily Wire pushing any of their own ideology in any way. It's just Matt interviewing people and they expose themselves in often hilarious ways.",False
21,10,"Inspiring, funny, true, family movie",paigeschwartz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I took my entire family to see this movie and each one of us were laughing hysterically! I haven't laughed this much during a movie in a long time. The whole movie theater seemed to be laughing and enjoying it too!I also loved the message at the end of the film. Our favorite part was how Matt would be patient and listen to people's responses to his questions because most of them can't even answer these questions at all! Awesome work Matt 👏🏻 we watched 'what is a woman' last year and that one was great too, wish it made it to theaters. Keep up the good work Matt, if you don't do it then who will?",False
22,7,Basically good,racunzasmeti,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'll give this a fair 7. I don't think it's as good as the What is a Woman documentary, but it is definitely still entertaining and well-paced. I think my biggest problem with the movie were parts where Matt really overexerts himself and obviously plays a bit. At some point I really thought people had to be paid actors, there's no way they don't catch on that Matt is exaggerating. Matt especially at the group therapy scene at the start overinserts himself into the conversation and it comes off as awkward, weird and just...very a-holeish. The film also really lacks researched sections that What is a Woman had and thus doesn't feel as strong of a movie. A lot of the movie was done well, but I think I genuinely felt a bit ""cringe"" when seeing some of the scenes. Still worth the watch though. Has some funny moments and great discussions.An angle I wished for and didn't get is, like in the previous documentary, confronting university experts to explain their support for DEI practices. Asking for evidence for systemic oppression and being able to validate whether they are true. Perhaps that's what I missed the most in this movie.While I may have focused a lot on the negatives, I think 7/10 is still a fair rating and I did enjoy watching this overall.",True
23,2,Came looking for funny--came up empty,mikeborgen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a pretty liberal guy, but I love laughing at hypocrisy. I love when people have to squirm to defend their position if they're in the wrong. That did not happen in this film.I was hoping Matt Walsh was going to congront subjects in his film in a confrontational and logically debatable style much like his famous ""what is a woman challenge"".Instead, there is no confrontation, there is only trying to blend in and mildly use Borat type Antics for cheap laughs. Overall, the arguments were weak and lazy and nothing was really said in this documentary.This film was a complete waste of time. Instead of making a documentary on the subject, Matt should have literally just had conversations honestly one-on-one or panel with people and stated his positions and that would have been much more funny with facts and truth, battling cognitive disconnect and victimization. That would have been a far more interesting and poignant watch.Overall this was a week, lazy attempt, a Borat
Style ripoff that missed the mark.",False
24,8,"The people who need to see this, won't",Cyns-Corner,n/a,16/08/2025,"Definitely worth the watch, though the people who would benefit most from checking it out won't. So this is essentially a ""preaching to the choir"" situation. Still, it was pretty funny and had relevant points to make. Walsh does a good job of just sitting back and let these people who profit off of manufacturing ""racism"" everywhere just bury themselves with their own ludicrous words. Will it change their minds? No, because people like this who are hell-bent on keeping ""racism"" alive (even though, as Thomas Sowell said, it's on life support) stand to lose too much if the problem goes away for the most part. Video review to come shortly.",False
25,7,Kind of sophomoric at time but funny,rfc-19739,n/a,16/08/2025,"I will admit I am drawn to movies sometimes that push back against the main stream movies and how they are done recently so this one fits the bill. As my title mentions, some of the humor is pretty sophomoric at times which actually helps the movie in my opinion. Makes a topic that can be a untouchable rail and softens it up some. Waldron plays the character so dead pan it is almost boring at times, but in some parts it is exactly what the film needs. Part of the appeal is when he talks to some of the other said ""for a lack of a better term"" and not to have a spoiler , it can show how talking positively on a topic can change the feel of it. I think most people will know if the movie is for them will know this before even going to see it. Will admit a few of the scenes run too long but what you going to do.",False

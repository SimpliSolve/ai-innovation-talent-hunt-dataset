1,5,Vitalik: An Ethereum Story,shavitben5,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Vitalik: An Ethereum Story"" promises to tell the story of one of the most innovative minds in tech, but delivers little more than a glossy overview. Instead of diving into the philosophical, technical, and emotional struggles that shaped Ethereum, the film opts for surface-level praise and vague narration. There's little exploration of Vitalik's complex personality, the intense debates within the Ethereum community, or the real-world impact of decentralized technology. It feels like a missed opportunity - more of a puff piece than a documentary. For those hoping to learn something meaningful about Ethereum or its enigmatic creator, this film leaves you with more questions than answers.",False

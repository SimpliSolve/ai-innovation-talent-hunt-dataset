1,8,Unbelievable,Pilolai,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cannot believe that her own mother would send her on a roller-coaster ride! She went on a mission to the moon and back, to end up with the outcome she did. I appreciate the creator for his patience and following through to the end. But I can't say I appreciate how her parents handled the entire situation.",False
2,1,Everything About this Doc is HORRIBLE,arfdawg-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"An assaulted teen gives birth in the deep south and receives conflicting narratives about her infant's fate. 36 years later, her mother gives a deathbed confession that the baby never died.A filmmaker helps her uncover the truth.It takes more than 90 minutes to get to the point that could have been told in ten. This documentary is slower than molasses and comes up short in every way.The characters all talk in slow motion the exposition is in slow motion and then there's no payoff. They interview the woman involved and her place is a mess. Bottles of alcohol all over and dirt on the floor. You couldn't cleanup for the cameras?And the mother in this is a witch.The filmmaker/narrator really needs to get a real job.",False
3,8,An incredibly crafty documentary,erikbbergstrom,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhere She Lies stands out to me among family mystery stories for its main subject matter, Peggy Phillips. Peggy's on the search for her daughter who she's come to believe is still alive, even after being told in the delivery room that she'd passed. It's framed in the beginning as a ""puzzle"", but it wasn't until after thinking about this movie awhile after finishing it that I realized the filmmakers gave us a clue as to what this movie is really about: not so much the missing daughter, but Peggy herself.Peggy mentions in the beginning how she'd cut puzzle pieces to make them fit when she couldn't find the right ones. I thought this was a clever opening, never really understanding how crucial it'd be to the overall story of this film. It's got all the intriguing twists and turns of a documentary of this nature, but at each one it's Peggy cutting the piece to make it fit.It's a very timely film, in that it explores Peggy with a very close lens at a moment in history when some legitimately believe there are powerful people selling and cooking babies to eat. Peggy is nowhere close to this level of crazy, though it's clear by the end that she's spent so much time lying to herself that she came to believe her own truth. The filmmaker's sister sums it up very succinctly: when faced with trauma or pain, humans will do what it takes to run from it, whether physical or emotional. They will, essentially, cut their own pieces to make them fit.The lead-up may not take viewers to a place they expect or hope for, but that's usually the case with truth. It's never as tied up with a bow as we'd hope; or, in Peggy's case, a fully-completed puzzle. As a story of a mother's search for truth about her daughter, it might make a good 15-minute read on the bus. But Where She Lies is so much more than that by the end. It's made me really think about the human need for structure, for answers, and for hope. Peggy never got to see her baby after she was pronounced dead, so she did what any of us would've: she held on to the hope that they'd be reunited one day. And even when she didn't get the answer she'd hoped for after nearly 60 years, she still didn't quite let go.I applaud the filmmakers for truly showing compassion for Peggy, even when it was clear the story they went after morphed into something completely different. I thought every component of this independently-produced documentary was well-done, from the music to the inserts and the overall presentation of the interviews. Here's hoping this movie gets the spotlight it deserves, and that others can connect with Peggy and her very personal, tragic story and use it for some introspection later.",True
4,10,Heart Wrenching,amylynnrobert,n/a,16/08/2025,God bless Peggy and her family. God bless Zach and his crew for telling her story with such delicacy and compassion. This is how humans should treat each other.,False
5,10,Fantastic Documentary with unexpected twists!,wardsheridan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love documentaries, I watch them all! So when a friend told me about this I had to see! Such a great film, compelling story, and incredible Documentarian to handle the heart wrenching facts. It's unimaginable what this woman went through her whole life, and after years of looking for answers, Zach Marian finds them for her and gives her closure! An unexpected twist in the middle, and interesting characters draw you in and make it a must-see. Don't miss this one!",False
6,10,Inspiration for journalists,julie-49380,n/a,16/08/2025,"To see such absolute care given when investigating the story is inspiring. The temple of the film allows one to completely absorb and feel the situation. As a viewer, I felt the story in its entirety has been skillfully documented. It is a gift to be a director that is willing to slow down and earn the trust of a mother that has not had a reason to trust in life. My take away was never give up hope and to except asking questions will lead to a truth. I wasn't able to stop watching till the end.Part of me may still question how Susan could resemble Peggy so much. The film directed in such a way leaving viewer to still want to believe. Thank you for delivering excellence.",False
7,9,DOC is awesome. Story is embarrassing.,adayfortori,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is well made and researched. It is presented in an interesting manner that does hold the viewer's attention. However, having a branch of family from nearby in Tennessee Appalachia, the story just embarrassed me. This woman doesn't appear to comprehend alot and seems to have been taken advantage of by all these people who led her to believe that her baby was a part of some huge conspiracy that encompassed hundreds of people, at least a dozen institutions, and several decades and generations. When you watch the doc you will understand. Good grief people!I hope the doc team chooses to make another doc and solve a real mystery. This just isn't one.",False
8,9,Wholesome,scuffysd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very tastefully filmed doc. Answered all the questions and followed through giving the viewers closure as well. Still some questions remain, though it really makes you appreciate the story, and remember it. Great film. God Bless Peggy, Darlene & their family.",False

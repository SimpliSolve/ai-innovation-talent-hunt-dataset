1,8,Nice portraits of the human-animal bond!,jrr-66063,n/a,16/08/2025,"I caught 'Cat Daddies' last night at a showing in Columbus, OH and really enjoyed it! It's a pretty straightforward premise: the doc features 8 or so men and their pet cats and shows how their human-animal bond enhances the life of each ""cat daddy"". I kept expecting it to morph into a lecture on masculinity and the history of the femeninization of cat ownership (which I actually would have dug, too) but it didn't -- probably to its benefit.The issues of gender, the effects of global warming, the state of American healthcare, Covid, homelessness, race, poverty, social media, etc are all present and important parts of these men's lives -- but they are woven through the film in a skillfully apolitical way. By steering clear of a social ""deep dive"", 'Cat Daddies' allows the focus to stay on the individual, emotional bonds between men and their cats, and -- like pet ownership itself -- remains something (most) everyone will probably enjoy!",False
2,6,real men with cats,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. There are so many ways to divide the world, but few lines of demarcation are clearer than 'dog people' versus 'cat people'. Being firmly planted in the former group, while being confounded by the latter, it was for edification purposes that I agreed to watch Mye Hoang's documentary. We got off to a rocky start when a Mark Twain quote popped up: ""When a man loves cats, I am his friend and comrade, without further introduction."" Nope, Mr. Twain and I will simply disagree on this.We are all too familiar with ""crazy cat lady"" syndrome - an often reclusive, usually elderly woman, whose love of cats has resulted in a veritable feline zoo in her home. The memes are all over social media, and they are usually good for a chuckle and a cringe. But what about the stereotype of men and cats? In the 1970's and 80's the catchphrase was ""Real men don't eat quiche"", and there was even a (comical) best-selling book by that title. But men with cats ... well that's a stereotype that never needed a book. Even many women shy away from the guy with a cat. It's this baggage and history that inspired Ms. Hoang to explore the topic. Well that, plus her own husband's personality shift associated with a cat.The filmmaker first introduces us to ""Nathan the cat lady"", which is how he's known to his 300,000 Instagram followers. He's an actor and has 4 cats, each of whom play into his popular, often humorous posts. But it's not all fun and games for Ms. Hoang. As she shifts from California to New York City, the camera turns to David, a homeless immigrant and former construction worker. David's story is the most poignant, and actually seems a bit out of place with the other 8 subjects in the film. In fact, David and his cat and his story could easily have been the focus of an interesting documentary short.""Real men"" and their cats make up most of the rest of the film. A fireman, long-haul trucker, trainer/stuntman, and avid hiker are included. Each offers up a tale of how their own mental well-being was transformed by their pet cat. There is also a segment on a non-profit cat rescuer whose mission is to minimize the number of stray cats strutting aimlessly. Perhaps these stories resonate a bit more as we approach two years on the pandemic calendar. One thing is certain, in a purr-fect world, cat ladies will now share the market with cat daddies.The film had its World premiere at the 2021 Dallas International Film Festival, and will be featured at several other film festivals prior to year-end.",False
3,8,One of the best documentaries about cats!,MehdiTaba,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is an affecting and insightful exploration of the profound connections between cat lovers, cats, and individuals facing homelessness. It beautifully captures the mutual benefits of these relationships, showcasing the positive impact they have on each other, enhanced by plenty of adorable footage that evokes strong emotions.The filmmaker's choice to focus on David Giovanni (the homeless and sick man), particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of social media, adds depth and poignancy to the narrative. The film offers a refreshing perspective on masculinity and strength, moving away from stereotypical representations.The direction, screenplay, production, and editing are all exceptionally well-executed, complemented by a fitting film score, excellent audio mixing, and impressive cinematography. The film maintains a positive and cute tone while being moderately paced and well-balanced. Overall, it's a cool, sweet, entertaining, interesting, emotional, sad, humanistic, ethical, cute, well-made, positive, beautiful, neat, and informative film that is sure to resonate with viewers.8.3/10.",False
4,n/a,"Cute idea, but reinforces a lot of harmful stereotypes",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a cute idea for a documentary with the intent of (apparently) dispelling stereotypes about masculinity. Unfortunately it collapses under its own weight, often times reinforcing these stereotypes instead of correcting them.The strange narrative of ""I've never had a pet cat because I'm a dude"" seems pretty ridiculous. The guys claim they've never been around cats and I think one says he'd never even seen one as a child. Did they all grow up on a deserted island??Most people grow up with a cat, or have a friend who has a cat, or a relative, etc. Unless you have an allergy to cats, I don't understand how you can go your entire childhood without any interaction with a cat of some kind. The director presents cats as some rare and foreign species. It makes it difficult to take any of these stories seriously.There are a few exceptions. I enjoyed the man who started a catch, spay/neuter, and release program in Brooklyn. That was awesome and even educational. The homeless man pulled at your heart strings. And I enjoyed the backstories of some of the social media famous cats.But for every good moment, there is a counterbalance of truly cringy scenes. Multiple men joke about using their cats to score dates with women. It just reinforces this shallow stereotype of one-dimensional men who'll do anything to hook up.How about featuring some truly authentic men who've loved cats their entire life with no ulterior motive? I know plenty of men at work who love cats without any qualms about masculinity. Again, this documentary claims to squash that stereotype, but only seems to reinforce it.And it's interesting that gay men are completely erased from the narrative. A lot of gay men are cat lovers, so it would have been great to hear some stories from someone who's gay. Instead we see a lot of typical ""bro"" types who want a pat on the back for having a cat.Ah, well. The cats themselves are adorable. I enjoyed seeing them and learning more about them.",False
5,7,Dogs or cats? The answer is obvious,smekalok,n/a,16/08/2025,"After this film, I was finally convinced that I am an unconditional cat person. A few stories, a few furry bundles of joy and pressing social issues. Perhaps the kindest documentary film you can imagine. It's also worth mentioning and thanking the MOYGOLOS studio, which did a great job dubbing the characters (with the exception of the cats, of course). In some places, I admit honestly, it becomes quite boring to watch due to the pace of the story. But on the other hand, this is a documentary, not an action film. 'Cats' is a calm, kind, sometimes sad, but not very interesting film. The biggest plus is that we are shown real people with their real stories. I think that partly thanks to this film, some people can pay attention to the problem of unfortunate homeless pets around the world and try to help at least financially. But from a purely cinematic point of view, I will say that the film is long and could have been made shorter by at least 1/3, or even half. But overall, the film is sweet and kind and leaves a pleasant aftertaste.",False
6,10,"Humuorous, authentic and uplifting at the same time.",Cowtownus,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the movie that made me get in the car and drive to the Newport Beach Film festival this year. The director knocked this one out of the park. An entertaining, uplifting film that moves the great conversation about masculinity forward. As a matter of fact, this movie turns the stereotype about cats upside down, too. The men came from different walks of life. Each one's story interesting and left you wanting to know more. The movie looks and feels like a Hollywood type budget movie with vast sweeping shots of beautiful landscape. Throughout the movie I was looking forward to what I would see and hear next.Definitely, worth your time and price. Don't be shocked if you want to adopt a cat after this movie. Wish more movies were like this!",False
7,10,Something for everyone that has emotions,maflamingogirl,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a wonderful film!!It went by way too fast, you fall in love with all of the cat daddies and of course, the cats!! Pulls at your heart and makes you laugh all at the same time!! See it if you can!!",False
8,10,A must watch for any animal lover,harrietcameron,n/a,16/08/2025,"An amazing experience, watching this in the DC cinema with a full house of other enthusiasts ready to experience what Mye Hoang had instore. I was not let down!You don't need to be a 'cat person' to enjoy this movie.The movie was funny, sad and hit at the heart strings in all the ways the interaction between humans and animals do.If you are lucky enough to go see this on the big screen, then get out there an enjoy this movie as it should be seen. The collective response to the onscreen events will be an impact that's lasts and makes you need to get all your fellow cat daddies to see this movie.",False
9,4,Mildly entertaining at best,Davalon-Davalon,n/a,16/08/2025,"On one hand, I find it refreshing and touching to show what can only be described as ""straight guys"" and their relationships with their cats. Some of the men and their cats were genuinely interesting; others, not so much.The problem is, this documentary delves into the private lives or the mindsets of some of these men for way too long. Some of what they're discussing or sharing has nothing to do with cats, although an effort is made to finally connect the men with their cats.There is a lot of talking and a lot of it was not that clear, as the men are not professional actors and they really didn't know how to speak on camera.I appreciated some of the sections more than others, and I certainly was impressed that these men all made efforts to ensure that their cats had a good life. But some of them have turned their cats into moneymaking machines via Instagram, etc. I guess I cannot blame them, but on the other hand it felt strange to know that part of their motivation in having these cats was to cash in on it. But that's human nature. At least the cats all looked well-fed and loved, and that's the most important thing.",False
10,10,Good for the soul!,bwbvwpj,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is funny, sweet, inspiring, moving, and soooooo good for the soul! I'm one of those people who rarely writes reviews, but I feel compelled to spread the word on this one! See it if you can!!",False
11,9,"Great film, I didn't want it to end!",IHeartMoviesandTV,n/a,16/08/2025,"A purfect movie because it was very unique to see the several stories of how cats can affect people in a positive way. People don't realize the intelligence cats have overall and the emotional connection they can nurture with people, if only that person invests in them.Also, just seeing the different ways people live life with cats, from homeless to firefighters, was definitely something that makes you think ""I wonder how other people live with their cats and how they treat them?""In close, when leaving the theater, I heard someone say ""I think I'm going to get a cat!"" That says it all, doesn't it?",False
12,10,The purrfect documentary,JustinConnorDonne,n/a,16/08/2025,"I normally don't like documentaries, but I love Cat Daddies. It has everything, storylines, music, emotion, looks and feels wonderful. It's touching, heartwarming and uplifting. I'd watch it again and again. And I'm eager for more, to follow up with a couple of these cats. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie for everyone, even if you don't like cats, the human stories are compelling! If you want to see an interview with the director-producer, learn why and how she made the film, her own cat story, the challenges during pandemic, and much more, check out @TheKittyBoss on YouTube or the The Kitty Boss podcast everywhere podcasts are available.",False
13,8,Paws up,scarlettsdad,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a cat dad and a feral cat volunteer, this documentary definitely spoke to me. Starting with internet star Nathan the Cat Lady and including a truck driver, a stuntman and the man I most identified with who saw the problem of homeless cats in his neighborhood and ultimately started his own TNR nonprofit. The most moving was the homeless man whose only concern was for his precious cat.The point, I suppose, was that men who love cats aren't sissies. I get that. As a man who manages a program in a large feral cat rescue organization, I am surrounded by women. I am 65 and single. I know that many assume I must be gay. Look, I love dogs, too, but cats have always been in my life. And like the guys in the film, it wasn't by choice...they chose me.Cats are cool. They don't automatically love you. So when they do, you've earned it. One of my cats sleeps next to me every night and is in my lap as I write this. The other was a traumatized feral who came in to my life 8yrs ago. She's now an inside only cat and afraid of everyone but me-and it took a really long time to gain her trust. And I can't imagine my life without them.So I'm a cat daddy, too, and could totally appreciate this movie. But to people who aren't, they may be expecting a cutesy doc and be disappointed. There's not one scene of a gay guy dressing their cat up and there are no cat fashion shows. Just regular guys who ended up falling in love with furry little creatures. Don't expect much more and you'll be fine.",False

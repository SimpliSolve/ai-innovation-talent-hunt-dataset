2,9,"It gives justice for the ICC, showing its importance to exist",cjgpbg,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary gave an excellent insight into the workings - and of particular importance, the reason of existence - of the ICC.When wars nowadays seem like a bigger mainstay of world affairs, the ICC's work to prosecute war criminals is undervalued. With a charismatic lead character of Mr Ocampo, ICC's first chief persecutor, every minute of the documentary is intriguing, helping us reflect too what is our role when conflicts rage on, and justice seems more and more out of reach in many places.Go watch it wherever you (it's streaming online), and may war, or any form of human-caused atrocities, not be a part of your everyday.",False
3,10,Behind the scenes at the ICC,regieweiss,n/a,15/08/2025,"A thought-provoking film which unveils the workings, challenges, highs and lows of the ICC from the first case in 2008 to present day. It shows there are no less atrocities in the world, but the fight to end impunity has not diminished. Covering three prosecutors over 15 years, the film shows the ICC's progression from the Prosecution perspective, with insights into what happens behind closed doors to bring a war crimes case to trial. Candid conversations and robust discussions captured on camera are being shared with audiences - a true must-see for anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of a war crimes prosecutor.",False

1,1,Not the most intelligent or accurate documentary I've seen,kirstenholmes-23716,n/a,15/08/2025,"Even as a Trump hater, I can't give this one any love. Its premise is that Trump is Revelation's antichrist. (head desk) and we're headed for the apocalypse. It tries to comment on nationalism but has no idea what nationalism even is. Come on, folks. Surely you can check your own basic definitions if they're the crux of your entire film?",False
2,3,This movie knows it's audience...Pro-Trump Chrisitans,gregorycbacon,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is categorized as a documentary. It should fall into political commentary, although I understand that is not an option. Through a series of interviews and a voice-over you're given several reason from a Christian view point on why you should vote for President Donald Trump. This movie caters heavily and unapologetically to it's audience of Christian that support President Donald Trump. If you fit that description and want reasons for your support, this movie gives several. If you are genuinely curious about why a person would want to support Donald Trump and are interested and willing to listen, it shed light from a Evangelical Christian perspective. If you are against Donald Trump, an atheist, or don't care for religion this movie will just anger and frustrate you and serves no purpose. The three stars comes from it's ability to have look professional (lighting, editing, etc), and ability to give information in a clear way. I can't give it anymore stars since most of the rhetoric given is pathos (appeals to the emotions of the audience) and what little statistics are given are unverified. This film falls victim to many logic fallacies giving it very little substance and is largely driven on the viewer's emotions and commitment for Jesus Christ. It's not strong or bold enough to change the opinions of any viewer. The interviewers are not relevant enough in today's politic climate to warrant any reason to watch for political reason. The most well known is Mike Huckabee who has not held a politic office since 2007. This movies knows its audience and caters towards them.My stars:
1 - worst movies I've ever seen
5 - neither good nor bad, meh
10 - best movie I've ever sen",False
3,2,Reasonably well-made propaganda film,jakelawson,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's not the Leni Riefenstahl tour de force it tries to be, but it's got some decent production values and strong message discipline. There's no attempt to educate; it's just a repetitive slog of the same buzzwords over and over.It's fact-free (or at least accurate fact-free), and it's self-contradictory in an almost comical way, but to judge it on those terms misunderstands the purpose. It's a get-out-the-vote advertisement that plays to the fears of its target audience. If you're afraid of ""satan"" or a ""one world government"" or ""black people,"" then it will probably resonate with you.If those don't induce panic in you you'll be rolling your eyes for the entire run time. It's dumb, but it does what it sets out to do and does it in a reasonably professional fashion.",False
4,1,I struggled to watch,mattyrogers-18023,n/a,15/08/2025,A Documentary is by definition supposed to be factual but when you site a book no matter how old it is no matter how many people love it as though it's fact and use quotes from said book as evidence to support your flawed opinions you've already lost any chance you had at your film being treated as valid & factual. You may as well quote Harry Potter to prove Trump is a disciple of Voldemort. I want the hour and a half this film took from me and I want the brain cells watching this killed. Maybe the sequel to this film could determine if there is A prophecy about him in the ministry of Magic's department of mysteries Hall of Prophecy to learn if he could in fact be not a Disciple of Voldemort but in fact he is Voldemort reincarnated!,False
5,1,Perfect for Trumpets,bluefoxniner,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLow budget, low IQ, zero fact based drivel engineered to feed the insatiable appetite of narratives and lies to a hungry Trump base. There's a reason they lack critical thinking skills...it's because they'd rather allow garbage like this do the thinking for them.",True
6,1,Misleading title,Reviewsies,n/a,15/08/2025,"Should be called, ""Trump 2020: The World After Trump"". I wouldn't recommend to watch. Very boring and poorly constructed.",False
7,1,So biased it's funny,coletterowens,n/a,15/08/2025,"The trailer makes this ""documentary"" (more like comedy) appear unbiased but that's clearly not the case. Overuse of the bible to portray their message rather than facts and statistics. Essentially trying to scare christians into voting for Trump. Pathetic",False
8,1,"If I could rate 0, I would.",isummers-57977,n/a,15/08/2025,"This has to be the most unintelligent ""documentary"" (if it even deserves that title) I have ever watched. They actually used Venezuela has an example of socialism. Trying to fear monger, and scare every single uneducated white person into believing globalism is evil. Not one person who believe in globalism is in the entire ""film"". Blindly supporting Trumpets who believe ""God"" is the reason for everything.",False
9,10,Great for Understanding what President Trump has Accomplished,missyp-07711,n/a,15/08/2025,This is a Great movie that really puts the politics of our country in perspective.,False
10,7,i give it many stars for nothing,torchiam-192-639252,n/a,15/08/2025,"I give it 7 stars because it is really very well arranged. But give it more star will disgust myself.But, this is, maybe the most cringe doc i watched recently. I am from China. I watch it as a standing comedian show. It really opens my eyes. I know there are religion nuts in the west but not that many!And as the term "" propaganda"" usually attached to China or North Korean. I mean you guys do it much better than us. It is not propaganda, it is literally brain wash.And good luck,
long live your political correctly democracy,
long live the 2nd amendment.",False
11,1,the lies never end.,filip9255,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the worst thing you will ever see in your life, nothing ever made is more filled with lies and bullcrap than this pos fable. This is the furthest from a documentary you can ever find, anyone that likes this move should not be allowed to vote in the USA. Since I need more characters to fill this review I'll tell you exactly what this movie is about. This movie is about how gullible and uneducated every single trump supporter really is, they have no sense of reality and the makers of this garbage know this, they know how dumb their followers are and this is the reason why they can get away with lying so severely.",False
12,1,Another lie,roxi-creations,n/a,15/08/2025,"If T could tell more lies this would be it. They are now trying to sell this garbage to raise funds for the worst President ever. America is not now, nor has it ever been a Christian nation. Most self proclaimed Christians have no idea who Jesus truly was or what his values are. This film purports to be in support of a judeo-christian nation without actually showing any Christian qualities.This is just another lie created by and for the cult. Worse than even The Witnesses could create. If we let these insane people in control of our nation, the freedom which I fought to protect will be nothing but a memory.",False
13,1,"Lol, you're a political addict",aryehwismer,n/a,15/08/2025,You should find something better to do with your time than watch this. Maybe you should listen to the God Awful Movies episode for this to get a better review lol.,False
14,5,Severely Lacking,thenerdykid,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm not going to lie- I did not finish watching this. To be honest, I'm only 13 minutes in, and I'm just not hooked enough to keep watching. I gave this a 5/10 because it fulfilled its goal; it provided a perspective about the world's future following the Trump Era (he might win in 2024, so it may not be over yet). But, beyond that, there isn't a lot of redeeming qualities. It's highly subjective and doesn't communicate much, if any, factual information, especially for a documentary. I'm sort of confused by the guests that they chose for the film. I would expect that there would be educated experts, rather than mostly pastors, to touch on the heavily political aspects of our society. Also, it wasn't really balanced. It was mostly just praising Trump and criticizing left-leaning ideals without providing evidence as to why their views were factually corroborated and supported. In my opinion, if you're going to do commentary, I think it has to be an equal blend of fact and opinion to really convey the message effectively. Also, it just seemed really repetitive and because of that, I couldn't keep watching. It just felt like I was re-watching clips over and over again. But, anyway, it definitely catered to its intended audience and that's fine. I just don't think it was my cup of tea, especially when I wanted it to be an in-depth documentary.*Note: To be honest, I don't think my opinion is nearly as valid as the rest of the audience that watched the whole thing (because I didn't). I just had a poor impression of it. To put it in perspective, I was able to sit through the Star Wars Holiday Special, but I couldn't get through this. But, if you enjoyed it, that's completely fine, and I 100% don't have a problem with that. Again, I just don't think it was for me personally.*",True
15,10,Great Documentary,ksnyder-56849,n/a,15/08/2025,Great Documentary about why Globalism is not good. L,False

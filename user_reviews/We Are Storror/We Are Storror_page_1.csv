1,10,WOW! One of the most heart pounding documentary films I've seen in years,imdbfan-2326534452,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a defender of Michael Bay for years. I grew up loving his movies. He's partially responsible for my obsession with film. He's a master at imagery and movement, and maybe most especially making what you're seeing on screen exciting, and DAMN did he ever make this exciting. I've never heard so many audible gasps from an audience at a documentary screening in my life.SXSW's screening was fun, but didn't do this movie justice. Whatever distributor purchases this NEEDS to give it an IMAX or Dolby release. BRAVO MICHAEL AND STORROR! GREAT MOVIE! GREAT DOC!Mr. Bay... more documentaries please.",False
2,10,I think Michael Bay just made the doc of the year,imdbfan-2553405233,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a fun documentary. I'm sure there will be other documentaries up for Oscar contention, but I really do think Bay ought to be up for a nomination here in some category for this one. It really is that good, and I wish people would give up the Bay hate and just accept him as a true American auteur. He brings his unique eye to the medium of documentary filmmaking, and somehow it really, really works. It's exciting, and at times surprisingly emotional, watching the story of these guys as they enter the latter stages of their careers in parkour.I remember Michael Bay mentioning doing an elephant documentary years ago. Here's hoping that happens someday, because his style and documentary filmmaking totally mesh.",False

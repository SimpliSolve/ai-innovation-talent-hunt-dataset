1,2,"Easy money., poor production.",isamuominae,n/a,16/08/2025,"They had a capacity to put this ""short flick"" on the Japanese movie theaters for a very short limited time. Aiming for making cash because Japan have the most loyal consumers of the Quuen in the globe I bit this bait without realizing that have ONLY one hour length! Not enough, Freddy old footage is not remasterized (except one cut) so watching this old analog stretched 480p (or worse) quality on the big cinema screen was really awful in every aspect.All footages of his singing are all butchered too, impossible enjoy his incredible voice and music... they didn't had the capacity to let this happen.And the interviews, there is no a single famous artist interviewed, not even the other Queen members appear.Pure waste of time and money, I never paid any ticket that had only 1 hour length in my life... and I got my lesson on the worst way possible.Anyway, ths documentary don't add anything relevant about him, is just a lazy cheap trap for the Queen fans.",False

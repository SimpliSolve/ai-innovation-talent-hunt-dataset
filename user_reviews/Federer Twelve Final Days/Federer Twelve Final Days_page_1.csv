1,6,Decent,eb-77766,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well, the headline pretty much sums it up.It was watchable and as a Federer fan since 20 years I was never going to miss this.However, the editing was not for someone who knows more about the story of those 12 days..A few things I miss from this:The big 4 (Roger, Rafa, Andy, Novak) had a doubles practice together before the match. Absolutely nothing about it.. to me a big miss.Roger and Rafa had a last practice in the morning before. Nothing from that either.Rafa flew in just to take part of that match and left early morning after. Cam Norrie was there and replaced him (no one knew why he was part of the team until Rafa left). Nothing about that either..So.. I just think they didn't include some parts that some fans would have enjoyed to see and that was quite sad.Otherwise it's emotional and interesting but predictable. What I enjoyed the most to see was how much credit Roger gave to Novak. They have not always been on the best terms but it felt like Roger really acknowledged him here and I feel that Novak was extremely grateful for that. It was really nice to see.All in all ok and basically what you can expect.",False
2,8,"I'm not crying, you're crying!",blaircatlinbrown,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIs this a perfectly constructed documentary? Nope. But it is one hell of a behind the scenes glimpse into a man that for the entirety of his career had kept his job emotions and his family close to his chest. As someone who grew into adulthood watching Roger (we're the same age), the emotions hit at a whole other level. Is his swan song a swan song for all us forty-somethings? When he said ""what's next?"" as he sobbed, I completely lost it. If a man with his fame and money and non-athletic pursuits can feel that at a major milestone, then no wonder us mere mortals struggle from time to time. Seeing Nadal's emotional reaction also got me. I knew they were friends and that Rafa has always been a sensitive soul, but PHEW! Their love for one another was palpable. My only true complaint is a tennis nerd complaint...why did we have to spend so much time (it was only a few minutes, but still) with Roger defending Novak? That dude is a straight up jerk and we all know it. Sure, he's great at tennis but that doesn't change the holier and better than thou vibe that oozes out of every pore in his body. If the point was to show just how kind and generous Roger can be, mission thoroughly accomplished. Could there have been a better arch to the story? Could the music and camera work have been a bit better? Sure. But ultimately, this documentary gave me exactly what I came for: a peek into the life and emotions of a man I've had the privilege of watching play tennis for over two decades.",True
3,7,A Great Capstone on a Career,michaeldp-89038,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you're a tennis fan you're guaranteed to love this. This documentary follows the final twelve days in the illustrious career of Roger Federer and it lives up to the hype.Overall, the only problem I have with this documentary is the premise. Simply, there's not enough content to truly fill an 88 minute documentary to keep the audience fully entertained for that time period.That being said it was a really nice bow on the career of Roger and it provided great insight into his thoughts going into his retirement. Furthermore, it was really interesting to see Roger talk about his knee injury and how both he and his family were impacted by these types of injuries as his career came to a close. I also really enjoyed hearing from Murray, Novak, and Rafa during the documentary and their perspective on Federer's career.Roger is my all-time favorite player and I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. A must-watch for any tennis fan.",True
4,6,"Nothing new, but for Federer",Schrodingermind,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like they say, it was not meant for distribution. It's clearly evident. A normal fan knows it all and this documentary shows nothing new. However, bringing Rafa after midpoint is a good move and a refreshment to repeat feel and shots, and matter. It did not show any conflicts, like day 1, 2 or so. Or like someone in Federer team who did not want him to retire or something. But, yes, it didn't happen. So, they had to show what it is. Regardless of shortcomings in the documentary, it was very emotional during the end, seeing Rafa Roger friendship. Roger strikes balance with Novak too. Roger gets a perfect career end. He deserves. And he will always be in tennis, whether he quits or not. His innovative moves, strokes are still read and followed by next gen.",False
5,9,A Heartfelt Tribute to a Tennis Legend and His Unbreakable Bonds,hasanozsoy,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Federer's Last Twelve Days"" is an emotionally charged and inspiring documentary that delves into the final chapter of one of the greatest tennis careers ever. As someone who was introduced to tennis through Federer, this film resonated deeply with me. His influence not only turned me into an avid viewer but also inspired me to pick up a racket and play as an amateur.One of the most commendable aspects highlighted in the documentary is the unique camaraderie among the top players. Despite fierce rivalries, Federer, Murray, Nadal, and Djokovic have managed to maintain genuine friendships. This is particularly exemplified in the heartfelt moments shared between Federer and Nadal. While I knew they were friends, this documentary reveals the depth of their relationship, going beyond mere friendship to something more profound. Watching Nadal shed tears, arguably more than Federer himself, was incredibly touching and showcased the strong bond they share.The documentary also captures the unparalleled admiration people have for Federer. His charisma, sportsmanship, and the respect he commands from both fans and rivals are extraordinary. It is hard to imagine the tennis world ever seeing another player who is both so universally loved and respected. ""Federer's Last Twelve Days"" beautifully encapsulates his legacy and the indelible mark he has left on the sport.",False
6,10,Such a beautiful human!,A26845,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never been a fan of tennis, but this little documentary was such a gift! An insight into Roger Federer - a true gentleman. My interest in Roger Federer piqued when I came across his beautiful speech he gave at the commencement ceremony at Dartmouth College. This documentary was profound to watch and I found myself getting teary numerous times while watching it. I was moved by this little documentary about this gem of person I did not know anything about. I think that speaks volumes about the kind of person that Roger Federer is. He is a sweetheart, a genuine person, an empathetic soul and such an elegant person that it's kinda hard to ignore his brilliance. He has a new fan in me!",False
7,9,Good one...,kulkarnimahadev,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is must watch for Federer/tennis fans. The documentry is beautifully carried n heart melting. I was in tears coupe of times while watching. I am huge huge fan of Federer n his classy play, so it touched me to the core. I am sure every fan will be definitely in tears while watching this, especially his retirement speech, even Nadal s tears.Director has done a great job by bringing other tennis greats of his era, Nadal, Djokovic n Murray.Considering any sport, Federer is the greatest sports person ever on this planet so far. No one has played their respective game so gracefully as the legend Federer. He is ""God of Tennis"".Love Federer.",False
8,9,"SO LONG, LEGEND.",andrewchristianjr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Roger Federer. The man who made me enter the world of tennis. Thank you! I never thought this documentary would be this emotional. Damn.When this documentary only tells Federer's last 12 days, it means I'm waiting for a documentary that tells Federer's career from the beginning to become a tennis icon and even sports in general.Synopsis:
Helmed by Academy Award-winning director Asif Kapadia and director Joe Sabia, the Federer documentary is an intimate follow-along through the final 12 days of Roger Federer's illustrious career. Originally a home video never intended for public viewing, the film captures Federer at his most vulnerable and candid self, as he says goodbye to a game and the fans that shaped his life for the last two decades. Featuring interviews from legendary rivals and close friends Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokivic, and Andy Murray, Federer: Twelve Final Days provides unprecedented access to the relationship between these unparalleled stars.",False
9,5,Federer: Twelve Final Days,henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"A film crew follow the best player that ever lived - I will countenance no arguments - through from his public announcement that he is retiring to his final match in the Laver Cup in London with all his friends and contemporaries.Certainly this is a very detailed look at Federer's last dozen days which evidently does not sit easily with the openly very emotional man. Clearly he is adored by family, friends and his partners in tennis with Djokovic, Murray and Nadal having much to say. On the downside, I will admit that I wasn't so keen on the, inevitable I guess, back slapping at press conferences and alike which seemed to stretch on for far too long to make the point. This was compensated for though by the last 20 minutes or so at his final match which was really very touching. It was sad that he seemed to believe his life was in some ways coming to an end - although I feel sure that his legend with continue to grow with the next part of his life.",False
10,8,"Federar, the human being!",SoumikBanerjee1996,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are only a handful of athletes/players in the world whose names are forever linked to their sport, and Federer undoubtedly stands higher among this elite group. Not only has he become phenomenon, a source of inspiration, but also an icon for millions of people globallyI really adore how the documentary delves into his personal life, showcasing his family and the relationships he has with friends and colleagues.Although I have watched countless matches featuring him, marveling at his effortless skills on the court, specifically those classy, almost effortless one-handed backhands that are in a league of their own.But this was the first time I witnessed him as a person rather than just a legendary player; he came across as a genuinely nice human being who deserves all the love he receives.Now, Just to clarify, I am not a hardcore tennis enthusiast, I certainly don't possess extensive knowledge or claim to be well-versed in the statistics or analytical aspects of the game. However, I did grow up hearing names like Roger, Nadal, and later Djokovic and Murray, so seeing them all together here was a real treat, a delightful experience!",False
11,10,A very well made salute to a sporting legend - Federer,vikaskalibaug,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a huge fan for me, tennis is Roger and I am sure there would be many fans who thinks the same For somebody like like Roger who dreamt, eat and Slept tennis. As a fan, I was curious to know how he handled the last few days before his retirement and this documentary lived up to it.Right from the day he filmed the message till the day he played his last match at laver cup. He handled all the press conferences without getting emotional and with such a great poise and I am sure it would be very difficult for him to hold it till he played his last match where all fans in the arena cried for Roger. Go watch his wonderful and emotional journey of last few days of man who is greatest ever to pick up the tennis racket.",False
12,10,A Grand Slam of Inspiration! The Great Roger Federer's Farewell Documentary,APurchasedSpiritLedSurvivor,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis emotionally charged documentary traces Roger Federer's career, family dynamics on the road, retirement, and final match. It beautifully captures the emotions within his family as he gears up for his last tennis match. The retirement of great athletes always resonates as a big moment for sports fans, and this film uniquely offers a glimpse behind the scenes, capturing the emotional unveiling of Federer's retirement decision and so much more.Documented are the factors that influenced Federer's retirement decision, including the individuals and reasons behind their impact.

This provides insight into the physical toll injuries and surgeries have taken on him, a perspective captured eloquently in the documentary.

This contrasted with his initial statement, which primarily reflected the difficulties he faced with his physical setbacks, whereas his subsequent remarks captured a more enduring emotional perspective.

13,1,Very niche movie with lots of shortcomings,onze-kris,n/a,16/08/2025,"It shows that it was never intended for the public and feeling the need to show this is why I stopped being a fan of Federer when he was okay with being called the goat.Young Federer was more a brat that had a real good touch. Federer later in his career was more calculated and what was called inn9vative is something what players much lower on the rankings tried out repeatedly. The short return for example is nothing new . Most off the time you see players go to the back to give themselves more time. The Downside to that is that you give the serving player more time. So by getting closer , relying on his touch. He took time away meaning that his returns shouldn't be as good as when he was more in the back.At the time Federer was being called the goat it was clear that Nadal was the greatest gravel player ever. And that he worked hard to adapt to other surfaces . And Djokovich was starting to catch up in titles on those two. Murray as a tennis player was really unlucky with them being in the same era when he played tennis. But I don't think he should be mentioned. It where those three ( federer, nadql and djokovich) and a couple of players below them but still at a very high level.He hept most of the time neutral on subjects, which sports player really should be, or artists , entertainers and certainly the press. Headed a rare exception on the brevity vote. I think it slipped his tongue. His neutrality is something that deserves my respect. Too many athletes particularly in the USA are misused for political and fina coal gains.Anyway as a tennis player , federer was especially early in his career a joy to watch. Later in his career he sometimes seemed disrespectful to his opponents. (And his rivals) his rivals seemed to the public fine with it. Although Djokovich started openly talking about winning the most grand slams. Which from an objective standpoint would mean he would be the greatest.You also should look at who your rivals are. Djokovic probably had the toughest time as he joined the nadal-federer rivalry later arguably playing the best two players at that ime wnd getting good results agaimst them.. And federer faced some players that were near the end of their career early on. And Nadal was no real force on other surfaces early on.. for example one of the finalists he beat I Australia was bwghdatis . While he was fun to watch, it is because the Australian open was not played by all players that he took some easier titles.Anyway back to the movie. I found the balance interview, bts and matches very bad. Editing was amateurish.If you are a fan of Federer I think it's okay, but rather it should be regarded as a document instead of a movie..
I don't call my home videos movies and this is nothing more than a home video with a bigger budget.And it lacks the creavity that federer certainly showed in varying degrees throughout his career.",False
14,2,What a wasted opportunity,gavinmart-586-928585,n/a,16/08/2025,"Somebody needs to replace this half-baked legacy attempt with something decent quite quickly because this will only do more damage than good to Federer's reputation.I watched, hoping to find out more about a man who I've watched play for a couple of decades or so and wanted to round that account up with a genuine insight into the man, his motives and his career choices. There was very little of anything of substance here. Why put this dross out there at all? Surely this is just the platforms racing to get titles out there, and the result of some hasty promotional deals done at the expensive of what could be a fascinating insight into a legendary man.I wouldn't bother to be honest. It's a durge, it's vain at best, and the sad result of the current trend to satiate platform audiences demand ahead of providing depth of content.",False
15,5,Beautiful Story and Even More Beautiful Person. Production Value Does NOT do him justice. Left me wanting much much more.,brianbaucum,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is Rodger Federer. This seems like it was a bunch of your buddies uncles putting some cheesy documentary together about their buddy. The music selection.....oof! That was a touch opener. I know what you were going for, but it was a huge miss. If you are going for ""Explosions in the Sky"" pay them! They would have made this film all connect!They really did try to reach for the emotional strings to tug at, but you can't try the entire film. Where is the build up, where is the drama??Just again...seems like a bunch of suburban dads who have clout in the industry put this together. It really was a struggle to watch.",False
16,1,My favorite athletes and the classiest person in all of sports,tdakich-29975,n/a,16/08/2025,"Roger Federer is my favorite professional athlete of all time.The grace and the brilliance of his game and the class with which he approached Everything is admirable. This documentary does nothing to promote Roger or tennis or the people associated with each.I have never watched anything with such poor musical selections. It is actually boring, has really bad music, and is unwatchable. If you love Roger as much as my family does skip this and go to YouTube Videos because they will much better portray his greatness and grace. Looking forward to the next chapter of Roger his contribution to mankind will continue to be inspiring.",False

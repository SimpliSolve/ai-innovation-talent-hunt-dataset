1,5,"Man took a brain, man kept a brain, makes for a scant story.",Steve9920,n/a,15/08/2025,"1 hour 18 mins could and should have been condensed to an adequate hour. It is a fascinating story, but only because it involves the most famous celebrity brain of the 20th century. Otherwise, it is largely the life story of the man who took/stole it, and basically, well..kept it for way too long with little product. But it is well produced with lots of interviews with mainly the same few people. Lots of photographs of the period which this viewer had not seen before, all very good quality.The book 'Driving Mr Albert' is far more entertaining and informative on the subject, a journey that is for some reason missing from this documentary.",False
2,7,this is not...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAn albert einstein ducumentary per ce, its on the contrary a loose woven together biographical documentary about the man who due to his job occupation had the hounor of dissecting mr einsteins body post mortemly, and due to several circumstances became the ingenious physicists brainkeeper, allthough in a big laboratory glass jar, kept in the secretest hideout whereever he and his family (and einsteins brain) moved, so dont come say that einstein wasnt a globetrotter...its not a sensational documentary, allthough its a fun and peculliar anecdote in the history of mankind. Its more a kind of pick-a-neese story about the pathologist who did its daily deed at job as every pathologist does every day, and the keeping of the brain was an agreement with the einstein family and society, that in a way brought him more attention than he liked, just like me the introverted grumpy old man... having said all these headless things due to IMDB character limits, there are just one thing left to say...its wellspent viewingtime and a recommend.",True

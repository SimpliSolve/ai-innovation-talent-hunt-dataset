1,8,Good Docu-series,mycannonball,n/a,16/08/2025,"My interest in the topics varied per episode, but all were produced well. This series explores incidences where sports and crime intersects.The episode where the college basketball players are fixing games was one of the best and hardest to watch, because you wanted to shake those kids and tell them to STOP, DON'T DO IT. The episode where the ice skating judging was fixed at the winter Olympics was also a great one because it was so high profile.A good series if you're into sports or crime stories, even better if you're into both.",False
2,8,Very interesting series.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"You don't need to be a sports lover to enjoy and appreciate this quality six part series. If you can think of a notorious, newsworthy sports story, it may just appear here, one or two are before my time, but some I watched unfold, including Salt Lake City's figure skating, and the story of Hansie Cronjer.It's very well produced, it's interesting, and informative, I couldn't detect any sign of bias, everything is impartial, both sides are put, you are allowed to some extent, to make your own mind up, and draw your own conclusions.I did prefer the episodes where I enjoy the sport, such as the football and cricket, however the story of Salt Lake City is fascinating, if somewhat ambiguous.It's very well produced, well put together, and easy to watch.Great series, I hope we see some more, as there are a few events they could cover, think of a well known sprinter ....Very good series, 8/10.",False
3,8,"Very good, But...",lukinsawyer,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's very good but, they didn't do a great job at hiding that they spliced together audio from the interviewers to have them say exactly what they wanted them to say. Sounds like a robot talking in some parts. Other than that, seemed great.",False
4,7,Good stories,Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series told some really good stories of corruption and sports. Each story was well put together from a documentary standpoint. Using relevant archival footage and interviews, and for the most staying unbiased and sticking to the facts.",False
5,9,Engaging and Shocking!!,sriramthestranger,n/a,16/08/2025,"These are some true insider stories that escapes a normal audience. Last 3 episodes were quite shocking. I mean the extent Greed and Easy Money makes a man go. Oh my God!! And, worst of all the leads involved in this don't want to understand how things work and more interested in the money. It highly questions the integrity and their position in the society. Fantastic series to watch in Netflix!!",False
6,7,Very cool,hossammota,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLike in sports or not, you can watch because the series is not interested in sports. I may not be more interested in exposing corruption that happened in a particular sport, and how this corruption changed the life of a person than when he was one of the best athletes in his field. I have one imprisoned and at the same time you can sympathize With the story of one of them, you feel that he is somewhat oppressed.The episodes are as follows:
Episode 1: Basketball (Hedrick Smith)
Episode Two: Car Racing (Randy Lanier)
_ Episode Three: Football (the Italian club Juventus scandal in 2004) After this episode, you can doubt the integrity of any football match you watch after that.Episode Four: Snowboarding (Jaime Salle and David Peltier)
Episode Five: Horse Riding (Tommy Burns - The Sleeping Man)
The sixth and final episode: Cricket (Hansi Cronier)",True
7,8,Great series to watch,thijsdocumap,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's very well made and enjoyable to watch from beginning to end. This is the kind of content I still have a Netflix subscription for.Stories are interesting, editing is nicely done and its quite informative without a noticeable bias.",False
8,7,Good stories and direction but the stories are over-streched,smartbendo,n/a,16/08/2025,I believe the series would more interesting if the episodes were 30-40 minutes long instead of one hour. I started skipping after the second episode. The first 2 minutes pretty much summarize everything.,False
9,8,EXCELLENT SERIES,sunildaswaney-63642,n/a,16/08/2025,An excellent series on sporting scandals. If you are interested in sports on a wide scale then you will definitely enjoy this series. I really enjoyed watching the ice skating scandal the most!8/10.,False
10,6,Why just these stories,ruud_rohit,n/a,16/08/2025,Where is the episode about cheating Patriots and cheater Tom Brady? Destruction of evidence by NFL to cover up the severity of patriots cheating was one of the most shameful thing to happen in sports.Episode on that Would be the biggest hit ever.,False
11,9,Captivating,mmolina2525,n/a,16/08/2025,Incredible storytelling! Captivating series that will keep you wanting more details about each sport. Even if you have no idea about the sport (looking at you Cricket) you will still be intrigued by the human touch put on each story. Some sad scenarios in reoccurring tales of having the world at your fingertips only to let greed and corruption knock you down. Definitely worth the watch!,False
12,6,OK,djurrepower,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe a little overproduced. Some episodes went on for way too long, and some just weren't that interesting. The first episode was pretty good together with the soccer one, but it's clear that all the other episodes are sloppy seconds. So maybe just watch the 1st episode, after that the soccer episode, and leave it at that.6/10: sure, but not really.",False
13,2,Somewhat Interesting,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"However, the lack of remorse when reminiscing and waxing philosophical on the historical facts but expressing some ridiculous levels of regret over being caught, you see exactly why this is called 'bad sports'.You're ALL guilty of felonious activities, and willfully skipped down the path for money and drugs, but when you had the opportunity to walk away and become part of legitimate society and said 'nope! I'm good!', and I'm supposed to feel sympathy or empathy?Nope. I'm good.",False
14,8,Interesting and enjoyable series,rws_20,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've seen all the episodes and they were all interesting and kept my attention. Some episodes were better than others, but that's usually the case with these documentary-series; the Need for Weed one was my favourite - that one had a bit of everything.I wouldn't mind seeing a second series, I'm sure there are plenty more stories out there to be told. But overall, definitely worth a look.",False
15,9,I didn't know about these events,Erik_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well done series. Each episode has the key players interviewed.It's an inside look into history and it's quite satisfying to watch.The best part is that the producers don't attempt to force feed the viewer with any politics, even though these events may have been quite political when they occurred.",False
16,10,Solid Story-telling,guybennett-12388,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a sports doc junkie, but have zero interest in things like Figure Skating, and Horse Jumping. However, every episode of this series gripped me, because the story-telling is so strong. The profile that emerged of the callous self-effacing horse-killer Tommy Burns was riveting. An anatomy of tough, enterprising, lost teenager who - morphed into an adult who did the dirty work for his rich, greedy masters. Great show.",False
17,10,there always be haters,inabon-57692,n/a,16/08/2025,"JUST INCREDIBLE STORIES. EVERY SINGLE EPISODE IS GREAT!!! DONT LISTEN to HATERS.SHOCKING AND EXCELLENT PRODUCEðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
BAD SPORTS IS DOPE FROM BEGINNING TO END FOR REAL!!!!",False
18,1,Lost me with skating,michel16555,n/a,16/08/2025,"Those Canadians lied and cheated there way into a gold medal. There is no evidence at all that French juror was corrupt. I think the Canadians or Americans put pressure on her to say that she had a agreement with the Russians. But this was made up. And she knew it and backed down with guild. Putting up a mediashow and some unrelaable foggy Russian mob ""evidence"" and tje Canadians amd Americams get their way in getting a gold medal. If anyone was cheating it was the Canadians and Americans.",False
19,8,Very well done documentary,oliviagummo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBad Sport, ""need for weed,"" attracted me because it is an amazing story about a man that came from nothing, became a criminal to get what he wants, and in the end meets his downfall. They find a way to really let you know the character before they ultimately show how he met his demise. The script is mostly interviews from the people involved in the story, but years later after they are released from prison so you get to hear first hand accounts of what happened. This makes it more interesting because you never know what could have been doctored when watching a movie recreation, but in this you hear their story and opinions. The lighting and color of the flashback scenes were perfect for the time, mostly because they used footage from that time period, which I thought was perfect. The music assisted with the storytelling a lot because it followed the mood that the subject was in at the time and brought the viewer back to that time with him. I would love to adapt a lot of the practices used in this documentary into my own documentary making because they would show you the subject, but then use b-roll to take you back intimate with them. I also enjoyed how they researched and got actual footage to use from that time instead of using new footage. It was most interesting to hear the recounts of the story from different perspectives where one of them turned on the other, but now they have grown past that negative relationship into a positive one.",True

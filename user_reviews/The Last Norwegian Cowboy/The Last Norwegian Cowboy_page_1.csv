1,7,A movie about work and friendship,OJT,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Last Norwegian Cowboy is a charming documentary about 92 year old John Hoiland who is running his large ranch in Montana all by himself. Rich people are lining up to buy his property, but John's wealth is not in the value of the ranch. It lies in the freedom to work his own land.So goes this description of this portrait, well worth a watch.Johns father Emanuel came from Norway as a refugee back in 1915, and John inherited a farm that has been his life since.Director Frode Fimland started off directing with ""Siblings Are forever"" and this is his sixth documentary - all about humans in their core.Humanity shown at as ow pace.",False
2,10,A masterpiece,ricmac-82648,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sometimes...place, time and story just click together to represent something that is hard to define in words, better left to quiet reflection.This is one of those films you might stumble across without being prepared for the raw beauty of what is being revealed, in the beautiful setting of rural Montana landscape. The filmmakers deserve special credit for capturing John Hoiland's stoic and humble life, working a small ranch, that is one of the last few surviving in the area. It highlights various themes in quiet beauty, such as friendship, honest hard work, the passing of time. A very well made piece of documentary and a credit to all involved.",False

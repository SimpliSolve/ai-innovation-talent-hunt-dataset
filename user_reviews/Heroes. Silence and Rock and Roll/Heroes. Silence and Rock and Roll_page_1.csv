1,8,Good piece,pablo_moriano,n/a,15/08/2025,A very good documentary about one of the greatest bands of Spanish music. Nice to see them speaking so openly and honestly. Shame they didn't last longer but what life is about.90 minutes that go by in the blink of an eye.,False
2,8,Dont understand,jtheater,n/a,15/08/2025,"I dont understand why bands like this decide to end. In the begining they said that the difference beetwen them and the others is that ""we wanted more""... and they give up.",False
3,7,Good documentary about a mediocre band,manoletevb,n/a,15/08/2025,"To be honest, I never got why Heroes del Silencio was so popular. Average band. However, this documentary tell us the story of a group of guys that one day got the dream. Good edition, good production. An interesting piece for the memories.",False
4,9,Love it,blackart-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"Bands that stick longer than them become play by numbers or a corporate act like a business. Only a few continue to release great music, most of them that keep together.... Live off the classics. So, understand the band and love the documentary.",False
5,9,I wish I knew...,cernamaricela,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found this by accident or would of watched it when it released in April. I also found this band by accident growing up with Jaguars, Union & Mana. But Enrique in his youth drew a lot of attention. I first noticed him with Maldito Duende & then of course HÃ©roe De Leyenda. I was not sure if I was hooked on his looks or the music but I know I enjoyed listening to his voice. But why is his hair dark now, I don't get it. Lol. I enjoyed the whole documentary, I didn't want it to end & hoped the band would perform one more time since 2007.",False

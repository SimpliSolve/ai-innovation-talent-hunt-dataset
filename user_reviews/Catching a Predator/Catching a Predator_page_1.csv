1,9,Shocking Story !,lyninbyron,n/a,16/08/2025,The Police did a brilliant but revolting job of sifting through the video footage of these filthy crimes that this disgusting human committed.Thirty years of prison is not long enough for this piece of rubbish and he'll probably enjoy it!I hope he rots in hell!,False
2,10,Great,mikeiskorn,n/a,16/08/2025,This was a brilliant documentary about such a sick case. I just find it so hard to imagine that so many people got hurt but nobody knew. That's to the BBC for shedding light on this subject.,False
3,9,"A shocking, sickening story.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bravo BBC for this hard hitting and shocking documentary. It's hard not to watch this and feel both sickened and saddened by the events that took place here.How on Earth was it possible that this guy got away with his crimes for so long, it is just beyond belief that he got away with it. You can only imagine the horror felt by the officers that had to sit through the footage, and witness his sickening crimes.Sinaga, I only hope there is such a thing as Karma.A very well produced, factual drama, similar in tone to the Forensics series, it's very procedural and informative.You'll need to be aware of what you're in for, this is a sickening story, 9/10.",False

1,10,"Chaotic, surreal, music documentary experience!",nicksplosivez,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even after having experienced the manic performance that was King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard live back in August 2019, watching this concert film still felt like a whole new event.Of course this is no ordinary concert film, spliced in-between the segments of live music (all of which are shot from different locations throughout Europe) there are bits of road-movie behind-the-scenes moments.The grainy film stock perfectly fits the distorted sound of the band. Likewise the constant improvised handheld camera movement perfectly matches the chaotic vibe of the concerts. The sound design as a whole brings this to a surreal level, at times live songs will blend into other non-live songs, or the sound from the documentary footage will fade in & out. The colour is also wonderfully garish & in-your-face.Definitely a high for fans of the band, but even for those who aren't familiar with King Gizz, it's a unique and stylish concert documentary that I wish I could've seen in theatres.",False

3,10,CHUNKY,P8nGriffin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe greatest concert film in recent memory, befitting of the greatest rock band in recent memory. That Self-Immolate tease at the beginning is still so frustratingly good, thank God for the Bootleggers program finally giving us (unofficially) official live versions of it.",True

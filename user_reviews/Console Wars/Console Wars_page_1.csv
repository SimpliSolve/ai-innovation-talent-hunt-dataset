1,6,The Story of Sega,anfski,n/a,16/08/2025,This should have been titled The Story of Sega. Its basically the history of Sega from its beginning going up against Nintendo and its ending with Sony.,False
2,7,Visuals Carry The Show In This Oft-Covered Concept,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"As the kid gamers of the 1990s now edge closer to 40 years of age, the topic of the Nintendo/Sega console wars is an oft-covered one. Despite being based on the Console Wars book from a number of years ago, I feel like this is the third iteration of such material I've seen on various streaming platforms in the last year or two alone.As such, your mileage may vary depending on your level of knowledge coming into the viewing experience. If this is your first go-round with the 90s console wars, it will probably rank a bit higher. If not, however, there really isn't much new here that I hadn't already read/seen elsewhere.Probably the hallmark of this film is its unique visuals, using a 16-bit motif on numerous occasions and to nice effect. What it may lack in out and out originality it somewhat makes up for in presentation.Overall, I enjoyed watching ""Console Wars"". I am 100% the target audience for this sort of thing (about 10 years old when this was all transpiring), so that certainly helps. The combination of being largely beaten to the punch by other avenues, yet looking so slick, makes me settle on a solid--not spectacular--7 stars here.",False
3,7,Finally a Documentary About the Console War,r-m-duffy,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Console War refers to one period in history where two companies, Nintendo and Sega battled it out for market supremacy. Nintendo long held a stranglehold (ie monopoly) on the industry due to both innovation and monopolistic practices. Sega of America sought to open the market through... well, watch the documentary and find out how they did it!I enjoyed how Console Wars built up Nintendo as a villain, then gave them credit for saving the fallen video game industry. But unlike other documentaries, this one doesn't pull punches and mentions some of ""cute"" Nintendo's cut-throat practices. War was declared and strategized by the upstart aggressor - Sega, which means the documentary focuses on Sega. There's not much nostalgia or other video game history here, just the story that the documentary seeks to tell - about THE Console War and the two companies that took part in it.",False
4,n/a,Sega fanboys,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a pretty enteraining story about the rise and fall of Sega. A bit (16 bits??) too sentimental however. Sega games and hardware were never all that, and it's pretty obvious that they never had a chance after their cowboy marketing strategies were eventually exposed by a lack of quality titles. If they ever even had one.To say that it was all the fault of a jealous Japanese executive is pretty cheap and I wouldn't be surprised if that golden guy from SOA blast-financed this whole thing, just to get even. :)",False
5,7,Today the gaming industry totals over 150 BILLION dollars. That's more than the entire movie and music industry combined.,imseeg,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a fun nostalgic trip back to the late eighties and early nineties when the first popular gaming consoles were launched.It all started with Atari. That company didnt last long. Then Nintendo popped up and the rest is history. But for a short period there was a fierce competition with a new comer on the market called SEGA, which games were more tailored to teenagers instead of little kids. Suddenly lots of blood and gore and action was available in gaming to millions of teenagers. They were lovin' it.In the end SEGA did not last, but it is fun ride to watch how they became the biggest and how they destroyed their own succes.",False
6,10,"I got my Sega Genesis for my 12th birthday, it was AWESOME!!!",freddy_at_home,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Sega Mega Drive here in Europe, aka Genesis in the US, was a fantastic machine. We used to play it for hours every day. It had no memory, so I would put it on pause the night before I went to school, and then me and my friend would cycle as fast we could after school, back to my home. My mother would then often have cleaned up my clothes and turned off the machine. DUDE, we worked for days to get to the final boss... Sometimes I just hated my mom!!I loved Nintendo too, but the Sega just kicked ass. I bought Sonic after being with my mom to the bingo, I won $250 that day, that is like $1500 today. I bought the game for around $65 that time. That was a lot of money for a kid. If you wonder, yes my mother took the rest of the money, her ticket. I didn't care, I was high on Sonic. Man, I had many great days, weeks, month and years with Sega. What a time to grow up. Magical!This documentary gave me so many fun flashbacks. Me and my friend, who played at my house back in the day, sat here with me and we smiled, laughed and just loved this documentary. And we had some few beers too.Really fun watching this. And to the guy who left a review, saying that Sega really wasn't that big of a deal... Dude, I'll challenge you any day LOL.If you ever was a gamer or are a gamer, this is a must watch!! 10/10",False
7,9,mostly sega,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,A great summary docu about video gaming consoles in the last century.amust watch for old as young.,False
8,8,Welcome to the next level!,coreaderz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary nicely done and awesome! entertaining and at the same time very insightful. it is produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg as well which means it's full of jokes and fun editing. highly recommended to watch, even if you've never played a videogame in your life!",False
9,4,Very cherry-picked and uninformative.,skidshajmil,n/a,16/08/2025,"A lot of people say that this documentary covers the story of SEGA, and while that's mostly true, it doesn't do a good job at it either.Documentaries don't usually require linearity, but for something regarding the advancement a whole industry, they really missed out on it. Failing to cover the more important aspects from the Japanese perspective, and rather just villainizing them, and not to mention completely avoiding talk about the deal between Nintendo & Sony for the Nintendo PlayStation, and how they shot themselves in the foot.The documentary also does not, even for once, acknowledge the contributions of Yu Suzuki of Sega into helping make leap into 3D gaming consoles, but has the audacity to showcase his creations such as Outrun and other scaler-sprite based games.This documentary does not do the homework for you, YouTube videos does it better.",False
10,8,Great nostalgia,danielcereto,n/a,16/08/2025,"I grew up in the 80's and my first console was a Nintendo 8 bits, and I think it was the most successful present received from my dad in my entire life.I discovered the NES from a friend and it was magical. A magnificent entertainment system and using colors! That was the starting point to became a Nintendo fan.But after having the successful NES I started dreaming about having the Sega Mega drive and it was even better! I remember Sega a the best console at that time.But, again Nintendo beated Sega with the Super Nintendo. One of the best consoles ever. And I bought it too. The 90's were fantastic. Pure Nostalgia...
This documentary explains everything from the point of view of people who created those dreams. Interesting to know what happened to Sega and why. If you're around your 40's now you're going to enjoy this documentary as a kid.",False
11,9,Excellent!!!!,bethjazotte,n/a,16/08/2025,Um excelente documentário sobre a origem e ápice das empresas Sega e Nintendo e a guerra entre os anos 85 e 96 pelo mercado até a chegada da Sony com o PlayStation! Vale a pena! An excellent documentary on the origin and peak of the companies Sega and Nintendo and the war between the 85s and 96s on the market until the arrival of Sony with the PlayStation! Worth it!#documentary #hbo,False
12,10,Great ending,bevo-13678,n/a,16/08/2025,I like the bit way the end where they went SEGA SEGA SEGA!!!!!!!?,False
13,4,Missing a lot of information,Metal_Robots,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lots of pointless pixel-arty segues (bizarrely ALL with vertical scan lines) and some interesting interviews with key '80/'90s figures in the industry. Other than that this mainly plays out like an account of Tom Kalinske's Sega marketing career.The interviews are probably the best thing about this, all the other information is scant (no verbal mention of the Master System, 32X, Sega CD or Dreamcast at all?!?!) and no details at all about the Saturn or even pictures, just a brief mention of it at the end.Anyone who is interested in this subject already, will already know more than is revealed in this program. As stated previously the only interesting content is the interviews with people like Howard Lincoln from Nintendo and Tom Kalinske from Sega. Otherwise you could get all the info in this show (and a lot more) just by reading the Sega and Nintendo pages on Wikipedia. I get the feeling this was not made by people who have any genuine love for the subject.",False
14,8,Very similar to other docs about Game Consoles...,suripat,n/a,16/08/2025,"...But, nonetheless, good. Watch it if you played through your youth in the 80s/90s and you will love it. After watching this I understood, somehow, why I did not like anything Nintendo, until today.",False
15,3,Not a complete history,thatcyberdude,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is hardly complete it's missing the Magnavox system,no mention of Epoch, barely talks about Atari and I don't remember them saying anything about Coleco. So if you just want to learn about Nintendo and Sega then watch this, if you want to learn about the history of game consoles look somewhere else.",False
16,3,really one sided skips a lot of information for almost faux drama.,jingorous,n/a,16/08/2025,A really interesting period in gaming turned into a rocky paced documentary its ok but really one sided and not entirely accurate because of it.,False
17,4,A boring beef between some dudes,Zotapianola,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a mediocre and badly paced documentary that somehow manages to turn an exciting topic into a total borefest.
It's like watching a reality show for boomers.
I'd recommend instead watching any video from the LGR and the Gaming Historian Youtube channels.",False
18,3,Nostalgia rush that never arrives,mtyducs,n/a,16/08/2025,I am right in the middle of this time when video games blew up. And this movie does nothing to get me to reminisce about those days.....which would not take much for me to get that nostalgia rush. The only part of the movie that took me down memory lane was a scene from Swingers.,False
19,5,A Decent Introduction,Raptorclaw155,n/a,16/08/2025,"If something like this were released in the first decade of the 2000s as part of some G4, VH1, or MTV feature, this would have been among the best made-for-tv documentaries about the history of video games ever made. In 2020 however, these types of TV documentaries have really been outdone in terms of their depth of research and scale of what they cover by independent content creators on platforms like YouTube or Nebula. This type of mainstream programming is inherently hamstrung by the fact that it is tied to the whims of distributors, and financers, and so it must adhere to certain limitations to make it as appealing as possible to a mainstream audience.The unfortunate fact for those who already have a decent depth of knowledge about this topic is that the content here is very surface-level and rarely explores topics it mentions any deeper than a simple mention. While this might make it feel a bit hollow for those who already know about this topic, I do believe there is some value in this as a work of nostalgia for those who grew up during this time and as a decent introduction into the history of the gaming industry for those who aren't likely to watch a 2 hour exhaustive documentary of the Universal v. Nintendo court case over Donkey Kong on YouTube. The information here, while obviously telling a story wherein Sega of America is the protagonist and therefore biased, I believe is just deep enough to be interesting to those who had no idea about any of this, but surface-level enough to be accessible and not turning into a college lecture.This movie's biggest strength for me was that most of its runtime was spent interviewing the major faces of the American gaming industry at the time and hearing their own thoughts and opinions about the various stages in the development of the Sega/Nintendo rivalry in America.It's a little hollow, but if coming from the position of an outsider possessing no prior knowledge about this subject, I would recommend it. At the very least, it's entertaining.",False

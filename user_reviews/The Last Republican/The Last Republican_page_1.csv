1,9,Reminds us that character and principles matter,lodges-40032,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was privileged to see this movie before the 2024 elections. Having it in mind made this liberal's despondency over the election a little more bearable. First, it's a fun and funny movie, which is rare for a documentary about such a serious topic. The director and subject have a great repoire (sp?) despite their strong divergent political positions.All Americans under the age of 25, regardless of political party affiliation, should see this movie to illustrate what we used to know in the days of Pres Reagan, Sen McCain, etc - we can have different viewpoints but still respect each other. That's how progress is made in the UNITED States of America.Major respect for Adam Kinslinger

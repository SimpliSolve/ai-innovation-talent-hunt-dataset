1,8,Enjoyable twist on the usual Space documentaries that ads to the enjoyment,bluesman-96747,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are a fan of similar offerings such as Spaces Deepest Secrets then this will already be up your street and has some of the same scientists taking part.It is the Phillip Marlow comic book element that adds a nice twist to keep it from being too serious.You of course, do learn something new into the bargain.If I do have one criticism of this and all of the other factual cosmos based shows it is that there are moments when they veer from science to science fiction in terms of attempting to assess possibilities that are so absurd that the first reaction is an eye roll.I look forward to more featuring the same characters though.",False
2,1,"Absolutely pathetic, sadly",bwdude,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am very interested in the theme as such.And the show has some competent people like Phil Plait attached to it.But as if that ""Comic Noir"" thing wasn't a bad enough idea already, it's done in the most cheap and pathetic way possible.So much so, that I could not even watch the first episode to the end.Please give me an interesting documentary, but without the cheapo wannabe-novelty.",False
3,4,I Don't Hate The Idea,tvdefrancesco,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat I do hate is the pathetic attempt. Cheap, completely phoned in. I've made power points better than this. Little Finger completely phoned it in. It's insulting how bad this was. I only gave it a 4 because I love shows about space and the Universe and want these types of shows to keep getting made.How the Universe Works, Cosmos, Secrets of the Universe, NOVA, even Ancient Aliens puts this show to shame. I don't blame the cosmologists & Astronomers. The abysmal graphics, tone, and heart of the project was apparent.",True
4,1,It must be rather painful to be THAT uninspired,st_stoimenov,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why, oh-why, you CRETINS are always so eager to encase everything in such a disparate and an out-right degrading package, regardless of the content -- or the subject -- that is being parceled up. You really need to learn how to control your pleonexia, stop employing this awful perfunctory sensationalism as if it is the genie that grants wishes and can sell virtually anything.",False

1,9,I loved it!,NatashaWM,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hilarious! I haven't laughed this hard at a comedy special in ages, situational comedy at its best. I find his jokes very relatable and I can see myself re-watching this special, and other shows of his in the future.",False
2,5,Getting boring...,jochemunlimited,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a matter of taste and this should be my taste at first, but it is getting boring for me fast. Lame situations and nothing to smile about. There is nothing special or original for me to take from this. So I never watched something of this man, but it will not happen again.He can perform and get a crowd going I think, but it is not my cup of tea. So a 5 for the effort but still below 6 because I do not like it.",False
3,10,Great Comedy and then some.,tiffknu,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm so happy to have discovered David Arnold through his Netflix special. He's the real deal as far as I'm concerned. I literally laughed more than I've ever laughed during another comedy set & he has me questioning all other comedians now. No joke!See what I did there? In any event, I look forward to his continued success and his comedic journey. He's truly a rarity in his field, and quite frankly a bit underrated. We have to do something about that!The way he both honors and incorporates his family into his comedy is honest, refreshing, and done with so much care that, even as a viewer, you begin to reevaluate your own familial relationships... Mind blown. This man's gift to the world is comedy, but it may just be even more than that.Essentially, all I can say is he's good. Real good.",False

1,10,A must watch documentary,MaryamA-907,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was really touched to watch this documentary. Very raw and honest story of women fighting for their voice. We need more of these documentaries to show how resistance and strong Afghan women are. Proud of my sisters for always being a voice for other women.Aryana is a woman whose voice should be heard and we need more women like her and Fazila who advocate for women's empowerment in the society.Let's keep it up and rise each other up. Women must be heard, must be seen and take space to speak up in the society.Thank you for all Afghan women who keep their fight for justice and freedom. Love.",False

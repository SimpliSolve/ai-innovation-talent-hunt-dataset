1,8,Powerful and important,tom_b_hughes,n/a,15/08/2025,Filmed over several years. The ever important voice of the trans community is told through the experience of Georgie Stone.Not just a story of her gender reassignment but a story of a young woman and fighting for what she believes in.An empowering short documentary that is a must watch.,False
2,10,Beautiful and Empowering,JasKiller,n/a,15/08/2025,"Georgie has a beautiful story and I'm glad they are letting people see it. Letting trans people tell their own stories is a perspective that is very often ignored.This shows bits of her journey and her activism in Australia where the courts were very much involved with each and every trans person's lives. It's a quick story and is easy to engage with. My favorite part was seeing how much support that Georgie has from her family. There is so much love in their eyes when they look at her, every kid deserves that. Watching her move into adulthood, take on her career, and advocate for herself is pure joy. Definitely recommended.",False
3,10,Beautiful and moving,georgie-17703,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is incredible - Georgie shares her journey so bravely supported by her amazing family and Maya Newell weaves the footage together seamlessly. This film is so moving, so important and I hope everyone chooses to watch it.",False
4,9,A careful handling of a sensitive issue,mdrew-59471,n/a,15/08/2025,"Only the most close-minded people could be offended by this story. Maya Newell, a director with experience of transgender issues, has shown us some insight into a remarkable young girl/lady. We are lucky that there is footage of 9 year old Georgie sharing parts of her story enabling us to see the dilemma and the trauma that trans kids can feel. The contributions from her parents and twin brother, although brief, help build that story. But Georgie is the real superstar - a young lady who put herself through a court case that had the potential to change the lives for the better of thousands of kids. No spoiler - watch the doco to see whether she was successful. I highly recommend this short film, created over ten years, and handled with great sensitivity.",False
5,5,Humanizing,keikoyoshikawa,n/a,15/08/2025,"This mini-documentary is all too short. I didn't know anything about Georgie Stone before watching this film, and that's why I wish it was longer and more detailed.A quick check on Wikipedia gives more context, and I think that should be have included in the documentary. Otherwise, it is confusing - for example, I had to ask myself: 1) who is this girl?, 2) why is she doing a documentary?, and 3) what's going on here?That's why I couldn't give it many stars. Which is a shame. Perhaps a remark or a follow up documentary is in order? I feel there is much more to her story that should be told.",False
6,9,A beautiful and important film,jojo-21812,n/a,15/08/2025,"Depressing (and inevitable of course) that trolls have piled into this film with their standard approach of giving it 1 star to down vote it. It's a powerful and touching film about the reality of someone's life. Not the lies and the fear and the hate that so often characterise government and media coverage in countries like the UK, nor about so-called 'ideology' and all that rubbish, but about the genuine, authentic experience of someone growing up and simply wanting to be who she truly is.Moving and powerful and should be seen by all those who can still retain an open mind, compassion and humanity, in the face of relentless hatred and monstering of trans people by powerful voices in Britain.",False
7,n/a,Boring,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found this to be boring. I also had to fact check several statements and events from the film and found them to be falsehoods. I would but recommend this film to anyone especially not children. I would avoid this and I rate the film just 1 star out of a possible 10 stars.Ranking it against all of the movies I have seen in the past decade, I would place it at 637 out of 658. That's a bad rating. I wish the acting had been more genuine. I also wish that the falsehoods I discovered were not included in the film. They take away from the overall theme of the film.You may want to watch with subtitles as the accents are heavy.",False
8,10,Beautifully handled!,gavinchadwick,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAn honest and raw documentation of this young girls life and the loving and supportive family that helped her through her journey.What struck me is how the family got onboard obviously from an early age and began documenting her story. As if they one day knew that they would create this documentary.This should actually be used as an education tool!Georgie is such an authentic, intelligent and engaging young woman! Her courage is quite exceptional, especially when speaking of her journey. I think the most poignant moment was she openly admitted, "" she didn't want to be trans, but she is and always will be'
BRAVO GEORGIE AND YOUR FAMILY!",True

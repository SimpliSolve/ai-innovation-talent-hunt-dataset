1,n/a,It could have been a good unbiased documentary but...,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerITs a great little story but its been loaded with the usual narratives and bias that go well beyond fact and relevance and strays frequently into the usual feelings or opinion over substance and fact to support the usual flimsy inflationary associations.Yup its to insinuate an underlying political narrative tone without being able to assert itself fully as truth without creating a profitable counter lawsuit.The usual presentations to align political figures and other movements or fascism as simply truths or absolutes is standard practice.For those who can't see the transition from objective reality to opinion or personal perceptions and bias its just the usual slow indoctrination to bias which is no different than how neo nazis are often nurtured.Slowly and systematically. It a great story with very important topics one should read up on or know about but save yourself this runtime imho and just hit up the wiki.Maybe watch a few more center media outlets reporting on the subject if video is more your format.This nonsense could have been cut down to about 30 minutes of actual quality content and instead of real objective presentation which is dry and historically doesn't sell as well (which is why it has died with responsible journalism) rather than the great bulk of time spent painting a picture and pulling the viewer into the emotional connection with the subject.Nothing wrong with watching such entirely normally evolved documentary styles that are naturally made so by the market and profitability.Successful styles like dramatization simply sell better and are emulated until it becomes the standard due to natural market competition of sink or swim in anything from documentaries to news media and so forth.How does the saying go we get the world we deserve because we choose it with each action as individuals.Just be aware like most documentaries so strongly related to modern political narratives as this is it has no shortage of disingenuous selling the point and drama without limits because thats what we love.Self indulgence and embracing our biases and dysfunctions as psychological necessities for the simpler people.Little different from any lab animal with an electrode attached to its pleasure center and a button for its basic need food.It will flog that good internal chemical feeling until it starves itself.Thats how the content and dynamics sell because they know enough to exploit our very core nature and instincts leveraged against our more evolved conscious reasoning and potential for objective understanding that is always working to balance or struggle against our emotional side and instincts.Still at the same times despite having no shortage of attachments or name dropping of what are the most left leaning media connections politically it does seem to be a bit more careful than many about how wild it gets with its line of reasoning or how quickly and steeply it starts from to find more people who must vote based on identity and not individuality.,True

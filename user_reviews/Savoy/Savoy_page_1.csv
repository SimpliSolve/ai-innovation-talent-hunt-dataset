1,8,A unique docudrama,cranberry_ln,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe uniqueness of this docudrama is in that combines acting with real-life, historic video and audio recordings, and it does a very good job. Transitioning between the two feels seemless.It was interesting to hear how real people talked back then.Something very important that this film does, is honor Kochava Levi and give her the credit she deserves. It shows her resourcefulness, wit, courage and humanity, a true heroine.It also slightly touches on the hypocrisy of society where she is shamed and juged while a man doing exactly what she did is called a hero. You would think that things have changed since then, but not much, which is why this film is important.",True
2,6,An important movie with great videography,adsasori,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie is a great made documentary switching flawlessy between real footage to actor footage made for the movie.Very recommended for anyone interested in the terror history of Israel or the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .The movie plays in important role of bringing new views of the historic story as in exonerating the name of Kochava Levi and showing her part of the story.I had some minor neat picks with the movie as the lead male who doesn't look like his real counter part.Overall, very well made documentary, recommended for any historic documentary fans, it's just not my cup of tea.",False

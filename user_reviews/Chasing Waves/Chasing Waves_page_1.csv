1,8,Inspiring!,nazlimustafa,n/a,15/08/2025,"I haven't been into surfing in any way before, but this documentary series looked interesting and I gave it a shot out of boredom. I have to say I really liked it and will be following the World Surf League and pro-surfing in general from now on.All of the surfers seemed like very kind and cool people and following them for a rather long time span was also enjoyable. I want to name a few inspiring ones in particular: I liked Shino Matsuda's self-reflected and overcoming attitude in her journey with ups and downs, Hayato Maki's philosophical views of the ocean and mostly Yuma Takanuki parts. For someone like me interested in the japanese culture, his parts were definitely the most interesting ones.",False

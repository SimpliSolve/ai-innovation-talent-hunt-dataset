1,8,A very good documentary about a true visionary and his ideas and their impact,thesien,n/a,16/08/2025,"The High Frontier is a very good documentary about the life and work of Gerard K O'Neil and his impact on modern space exploration. The documentary also has the same name as the book O'Neil wrote in 1976 about how space colonies could be built in the near future.The documentary features O'Neil's family, Freeman Dyson, Jeff Bezos, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C Clarke, Peter Diamandis and others talking about how dramatic O'Neil's ideas were and how much impact they had on them. O'Neil was a professor of Physics at Princeton who contributed massively to the design of particle accelerators and then started to write about how mankind could go into space in the near future.For anyone who has read The High Frontier the documentary provides interesting background on O'Neil and shows how his ideas impacted others. For anyone who hasn't the documentary should be a good introduction to his ideas and should encourage people to read the book.",False

1,9,Better than I thought...,jonnyv,n/a,15/08/2025,"A decent trip through Canadian rock and roll nostalgia. A lot of great clips and all 3 band members participated significantly. I would point out a couple of shortcomings. One, I would have liked to see a little more focus on the songwriting process. Two, like a recent Rush documentary, the presentation of the band mostly ignored any downsides of their behavior over the years. Did any of them ever use any substances or have other difficulties in life? There is also no mention of any of their family life, marriages, children etc. The inclusion of this would have made the documentary more complete. But definitely worth a watch.",False
2,9,Watch it ...,Reviewer99,n/a,15/08/2025,A great story about the Toronto based band. This documentary will set them apart from Rush whom they were confused with at times. Individually they're great musicians too. Song writing was okay with straightforward hard rock lyrics of the period.,False
3,10,Honest,nitro72,n/a,15/08/2025,"Emotionally charged & visually fresh, this fast-paced (yet in-depth) doc is (above all) honest, with tons of info, anecdotes, & perspectives. May resonate best (or only) with fans, but that suits me just fine. #nitrosMovieChallenge.",False
4,n/a,Where Can We Watch This Movie???,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,Why make a movie and not let people watch it? I've searched all over and can't find where I can watch this??? And even the streaming service aggregators do not even recognize the title.,False

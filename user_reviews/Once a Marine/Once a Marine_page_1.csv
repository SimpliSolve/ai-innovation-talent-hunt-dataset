1,7,This proves war is stupid,intermedx,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have no sympathy for these guys as they chose to be part of an invading force. It also reaffirms my belief that most combat types are idiots and stupid.That said, the movie is good for ANYONE considering joining the military to show how it can utterly destroy your life as well as the lives of those you kill in combat.",False
2,10,Insightful and moving,bgessner7-429-599936,n/a,16/08/2025,"I never write reviews but felt compelled to with this film as it deserves more than the ignorance spewed in the one and only review so far. This is an extremely candid documentary, as advertised. These men didn't choose to go to war, politicians made that decision for them, and they simply answered the call. Those that have the audacity to slander our soldiers need to realize that if they weren't brave enough to volunteer in the first place, a draft is a possible scenario and I guarantee those spewing hate would be the first to s*** their pants and commend the heroes that willingly put their lives on the line so that civilians like them don't have to.",False
3,10,Uncensored Insight,Chels1006,n/a,16/08/2025,"Agree with review 2. Men and women who have been to war have been trained how to survive, but they aren't trained how to reincorporate themselves into civilian life. The VA is woefully inexperienced at being empathetic to veterans and often rely on medications that could do more harm than good, instead of addressing the root of what they need. Most vets would agree that civilians will never have even an inkling of understanding a fraction of what they experience. I applaud these men for bringing awareness in their own words about how these guys are left hanging without knowing what to do after that DD-214 is processed. There are many resources and methods available for coping with PTSD & other issues when leaving service outside the VA. I would hope they continue to fight for themselves and wish we could get an update on them if possible. Thank you guys for making this video, but most of all for the honesty in sharing your experiences.",False

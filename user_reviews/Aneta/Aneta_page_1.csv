There were so many mistakes made when it happened that may be why we'll never know the definite conclusion; suicide, or hominid√©? When I tell you I got the chills watching this, I'm not lying, and it is very enjoyable piece. I did decide to watch it after seeing some reactions, and I was pulled right in, not being able to leave. How can you lose a heart? How can you not collect all available evidence that could be very vital for the case? Why do you not get blood samples from the witnesses if you know they spent the night drinking, doing drugs with the victim? WHY.",True

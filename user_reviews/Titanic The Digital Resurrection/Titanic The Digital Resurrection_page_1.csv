1,6,Perhaps Poorly Advertised/Marketed?,Jeg_er_Bertie,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a decent little 70 minute run-down of the sinking of the Titanic, but it is almost completely repeated information from any other Titanic documentary, meanwhile three people stand in front of huge screens showing the digital twin. This special focuses on the emotional experience of the passengers and crew and details some information about who was on board. That's fine, but I was not expecting that; based on the title and synopsis, I expected this to be a documentary about the process of the Titanic's digital resurrection. I. E., how she was scanned, how the 3D model was constructed and processed, and everything that went into creating the digital twin. There is almost nothing detailed about the digital resurrection itself.I also think this special was made too soon, because it talks about how the scan opens up the possibilities of future investigation, but doesn't go into that yet due to how recent this was scanned.Ultimately, if you have seen one or two Titanic documentaries AND you've already seen pictures and/or models of the new digital scan, you've essentially already seen this documentary.",False
2,6,Worth watching but not groundbreaking by any means,Mccadoo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most of what's here has been done before and better. The scans are impressive but most are a bit dark so it's hard to discern a lot of detail. Overall it's a great effort to show the entire wreck but it's nothing that hasn't been done already in other better done documentaries.The biggest problem I had with it was the leaps they take with the facts. They present a simulation of the ship hitting the iceberg and the exact damage it did to the hull as if it's a forgone conclusion when in fact it's anything but. They are making educated guesses but in truth there's no way they can know exactly what the damage is because that part of the hull is buried in the ocean floor. They present their theory as fact when it's really just supposition. Struck me as very disingenuous.They so this numerous times throughout the documentary and after a while it gets old. In truth they have no way of actually knowing what actually happened and are making some very large assumptions based on what's left of the ship. That's what I found most disappointing here. To the point that I almost stopped watching several times.If you're even just an armchair expert regarding the Titanic sinking this documentary isn't going to show you anything new and the opining of the three hosts will probably begin to sound hollow to you very quickly. Still, the digital reconstruction is impressive if also very grim when you see how far the wreck has deteriorated since it was first discovered back in the 1980's. I suppose it's worth watching for that at least.",False
3,6,Reasonable TV documentary,rwmj,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was marketed as a breakthrough documentary, but if you've watched Titanic documentaries nothing much will be new here. We do however get beautiful renderings of the ship taken from underwater scans which really help to understand the wreck.I would have liked a bit more detail about how the ship was scanned, how the huge debris field was investigated, and how the pictures were pieced together. Along with how the iceberg simulations were made (like, how do they know the shape of the iceberg?)Still, it's entertaining enough and at 70 minutes long it was about the right length for the material presented.",False
4,7,"Wreckage in high-def, depth in short supply",pinkmanboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"The idea behind ""Titanic: The Digital Resurrection"" is, on paper, pretty fascinating: to use the most advanced underwater scanning tech ever applied to a shipwreck to recreate, with near-perfect precision, the wreck of the Titanic and the massive debris field surrounding it. And honestly, on a technical level, the documentary is a milestone. The visual detail is jaw-dropping-from the first descent of the remotely operated cameras to the stunning digital flyovers of the wreckage, everything is captured with a level of realism you rarely see in this kind of production. The team at Magellan, who processed over 700,000 images across two years to build a 3D model of the ship, deserves serious props. Visually, it really does feel like we're walking across the Titanic for the first time-not through some Hollywood dramatization, but through the real, mangled, ghostly remains sitting 3,800 meters below the surface.But while the technical precision is impressive, the storytelling doesn't always keep up. The documentary jumps between genuinely interesting discoveries and pretty flimsy conclusions, like it's trying to stretch some of its findings into something groundbreaking when, really, they just confirm what we already figured out decades ago. For example, the assumption that a certain mast's position means the crew was trying to launch another lifeboat as the deck was going under-it comes off as a bit obvious, even naive. Sure, it's cool to see the steam valve that kept the lights on during the final moments, but that's not new, and it doesn't really change our understanding of anything. What's missing is a sense of true investigative purpose. Instead of breaking new ground, the film often leans on speculative interpretations and old myths dressed up as fresh revelations.Maybe the documentary's biggest win-aside from the tech-is how it shows the disaster for what it really was: brutal, violent, and far from the polished, almost theatrical image we've gotten from films like James Cameron's ""Titanic."" ""Titanic: The Digital Resurrection"" gives us a shattered scene, where the ship was literally ripped in half with staggering force. The break-up theory is explored here with surgical precision, backed by solid explanations about accumulated structural stress and the cascading failure of key components. That kind of analysis, supported by modern simulations and scan data, actually contributes something meaningful to how we understand the tragedy. This is where the film really shines-not when it tries to reconstruct a crew member's final steps based on a single detail, but when it lets the Titanic's physical remains tell the story more than a century later.Another strong point is the respect the film tries to maintain for the site as a mass grave. The Titanic-as-tomb idea is handled seriously, though the documentary does run into some contradictions. It wrestles with the ethical stance of ""look but don't touch"" versus the archaeological urgency of preserving, studying, and maybe even retrieving artifacts before the wreck decays completely. The comparison to Pompeii is a powerful one and raises legitimate questions about what's actually being done-or blocked-in the name of honoring the dead. The criticism that banning access to the ship's interior is keeping important discoveries out of reach is valid and presents a moral dilemma that any future Titanic project will have to reckon with.That said, there's definitely something a little forced in how the film tries to tie tiny pieces of evidence to specific historical figures. Efforts to dramatize things like a bracelet or a pair of binoculars by identifying their supposed owners often feel out of place-random curiosities in a film that should be leaning harder into scientific precision than emotional pull. And at times, it tips into full-on sensationalism, like when it tries to turn every twisted piece of metal into some major clue, even when there's just not enough to support the theory. That kind of thing distracts from the genuinely significant findings and waters down the impact of the real contributions.All in all, ""Titanic: The Digital Resurrection"" is a stunning technological achievement that unfortunately stumbles when it comes to narrative structure. The quality of the 3D images is beyond question-they're historical records that'll stick around, especially since the Titanic itself is being eaten away by iron-eating bacteria at a terrifying pace and may vanish entirely in a few decades. But while the film dives deep into the ocean, it rarely dives as deep into the analysis. You get the feeling there was a more powerful, more insightful documentary hiding somewhere in the shadows of the wreckage and the silence of history, but the script, maybe too eager for answers or mass appeal, decided to keep things on the surface.",False
5,8,Awesome,c_rey-18654,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was pretty amazing seeing the scanned image to scale; a shame the wreck is in such a state of decay by the time this could be pulled off but nonetheless, very cool to see. I also found it interesting they included a simulation of what would've happened if the ship hit the iceberg straight on. It's often talked about never visualized. Personally, I would've loved to see more of the scan itself. There were theories and stories discussed, that if you're not already an avid reader of Titanic, you might find pretty interesting. I wouldn't have minded it being even longer, keep everything in but show us more of the actual scan. Overall, I really enjoyed it.",True
6,6,Well-worth watching...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Of course I had to watch the 2025 documentary ""Titanic: The Digital Resurrection"", as I had the opportunity to do so.I was rather impressed with the replica that they were capable of making from the data that the two submersibles, named Romeo and Juliet, gathered. It was really impressive and just put a lot of things into perspective. I have to say that it was awe-inspiring.The documentary does also shed some light on some aspects of the sinking that I had never heard about before.All in all, this 2025 documentary is definitely well-worth checking out, provided you have an interest in the Titanic or the tragic events of April 14th, 1912.My rating of director Fergus Colville's 2025 documentary ""Titanic: The Digital Resurrection"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",False
7,8,"< 1912 - 113 Years Later, TITANIC Continues To Fascinate Us All >",paulscudder,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched> Monday, 19th May, 2025 @ Edge Water Studios, Singleton, Lancashire, England. Rated 4 * * * * Very Good < Cert. Would be a U > This was yet another documentary of the worlds most famous ship wreck laying at the bottom of the Atlantic. One of many thousands of documentaries made, and books written. This first time 'digital' creation in such a large scale was of big interest, and fascination on how it looks from the outside in such detail, having taken thousands of photos of it, and put together in modern day digital form, which will be able to be kept forever, for all to see when we are dead and gone. Still their are questions to be asked, and are unanswered, and will never be answered, as they are taken to the ships grave. A few interesting facts that I have come across over the years, and my deep interest in the subject matter of the Titanic, similar to the history of Jack The Ripper, another part of British history, which is unanswered, back in 1888 - 137 years ago, WHO WAS HE? Fact One > The financial owner of the Titanic, White Star Line was J. P. Morgan, who was going to be on board the maiden voyage of the Titanic, until the very last minute, when he withdrew his luggage and didn't go on this fatal voyage to New York. WHY? Fact two > During the voyage, the ship was troubled with fires breaking out in the engine room, from the 29 large boilers, as big as a large two story house, as the stokers working 24 hours firing up the ships boilers with coal to keep the ship going, especially at full speed ahead. So big an operation this was, and the immense amount of coal having to be used, meant that all ships sailing at the time, had to be cancelled, so they could give their coal to the Titanic, so it could sail. The passengers travelling first class on these cancelled ships, were offered tickets for third class on the Titanic, which majority took up the offer, as they didn't want to give up a chance of a lifetime to sail on this most famous and spectacular ship of its time, though Titanic did have a sister ship called the Olympic, which was like a 'twin' in size and decoration inside. The theory of these boilers, is that when water poured in through the sliced open part of the ship, that the iceberg caused, creating explosions of the boilers, with the freezing water and the extreme heat of the boilers. It was found that some parts of the ripped open ship, the metal was bending out, rather than bent in. Fact 3 > More of a theory, than anything else, that circulated over the years, was it the Titanic that sunk that day, or was it the Olympic, in case something did happen, they didn't want it to be their pride and joy of the Titanic. I very much doubt this theory, myself. Finally Fact 4 > In hindsight, if the ship would have gone head on into the iceberg, the ship would not have sunk, as it would have just caused a massive jolt, possibly throwing some passengers out of their beds as they slept, and possibly only filling one baulk head with water, if that. The pointed bow of the ship would have just took the damage, which would have been far less than slicing open the side of the ship. At the time though, you just wouldn't think to do that, as instinct would tell you to turn the ship away, as best you can, as they did, but unfortunately it does take up to a mile in distance for a ship that size to turn in time, as is what happened, sadly.

8,3,Superficial and shallow,soarer-04861,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off the Magellan scans are amazing, and Parks Stephenson is a great guy, but this documentary was disappointing, but I expected it to be. It's another generic format documentary that came across as cold and insincere. Much of the content was filler as expected, and the shots they show of the digital scans are heavily darkened with shadows so a lot of details are lost. This is merely casual viewing for someone flicking through Netflix/Disney, not your well versed Titanic enthusiast, fortunately there is a lot better content on Youtube these days with various creators genuinely passionate about Titanic that go into a lot more detail. I suppose 'The Digital Resurrection' is still worth a watch but it's a reminder to me how lazy documentaries have become, a lot more effort was put into Titanic documentaries decades ago and when you see the likes of this one it shows.",False
9,2,Run of the Mill,seanie188-261-717849,n/a,16/08/2025,"As stated in other reviews, the scans are good. But thats about it. The experts reactions to things are cringey and fairly overly dramatic for facts that are not really groundbreaking.What I found most annoying was the increduality of the so called ""experts"" over very normal facts that anyone is aware of.I did find the ship break quite interesting however. I dnt think people were realistically 'trapped' in there....just my opinion...but thought that was a far fetched idea.Give it a miss.....unless you have it on for background noise. Youtube has far better content, suprisingly enough....",False
10,3,They Scanned the Titanic,ChrisC-741,n/a,16/08/2025,"The headline says it all. While the technology is incredible, and I thoroughly enjoyed the visuals of the scans of a ship wreck we all know is destined to disappear, the remainder of this special was hollow with no clear agenda and dialogue that read like a teen attempting to hit the minimum word limit in a school paper. The messages were redundant, no real information was gleaned from the scans and while I appreciate their focus on the acts of heroism on board the ship that night, that focus was temporary as the dialogue shifted to pure speculation in a poorly executed attempt to humanize a ship wreck that is already inherently human in nature.",False
11,5,Needed More Science,SarahS-213,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe digital model of Titanic is amazing. The documentary, however, mostly consisted of keeping the audience on the edge of their seat with no payoff. Worse, it left out a frustrating amount of information.For example, they talked about the iceberg damage on the bow of the ship being buried in the mud, but they also presented a digital depiction of the damage. How did the model generate that result? Show your data?They also howed a hypothetical scenario demonstrating the damage to the ship if the crew hadn't turned, and condemned the crew, saying the ship wouldn't have sunk in that scenario. Couple things! The ship wouldn't have sunk if they had started turning a second sooner, or if the rudder had more authority, or this, or that. Also, the demonstration showed the bow of the ship compacting like a pancake, nice and neat. 5 compartments. Ok, but where did everything in the bow go? No splintering? No metal being pushed back through the ship? They didn't show any data supporting how this neat pancake would have happened and saved the ship.Where's their data showing that shape of the iceberg? They can't make the conclusions they did without that.And although I want Murdock exonerated-- unfortunately, they didn't provide data for that either.The dramatic presentation of the show made me want the data!",True
12,3,May I see it? No,mickeythechamp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Still knocking out some 2025 releases before my mid-year review episode on my podcast. I wanted to check out this doc after I saw it pop up on Disney plus but man I was presented with a low quality one. This is such an over dramatic wasted potential doc that I wish was so much better and actually SHOWED the impressive idea and premise of this entire doc, but no, we are left with a fine enough doc that is interesting enough, but overall just missed the mark on so many vectors.After 2 years of work, a full 3D scan of the Titanic has been made. Researchers can now for the fist time see the Titanic wreck and analyse what might have happened that awful night.The problem with the doc is the presentation. It is presented in this overly dramatic way and with some clearly written dialogue for the researchers. It breaks the documentary illusion and breaks these actually smart people to be props more than raw researchers that I would rather listen to. The other big presentation problem is no doubt that this is a doc about the most advanced 3D scan of the Titanic ever, but we don´t really see it. They even blow there load a bit early showing the 3D scan before their built up, even the poster is the 3D scan. But we never get to see it in its full glory and that's a shame, when that is the entire premise and reason to even do the doc to begin with.The doc is broken up into a few chapters or happenings that all tell different stories of that night. The flooding and boiler room talk is so interesting and it makes so much more sense how this happened to something called unsinkable. The other part is more human stories that is just pure speculation but interesting none the less. The problem is once again, speculation. This doc came out way before real research has actually been done to the 3D scan, and there is a lot of what I call arkeological talk in this doc. ""We can assume"", ""It is possible"", so we haven't actually researched this proper yet, but we kind of need to show this of now. Maybe this should have been researched more so we don´t need to do this song and dance next year again.This is not a bad doc in it of itself and I was interested about the whole idea. But the staged presentation and the cringe dialogue and the overly dramatic presentation just took me out of it. And the lack of focus on what is actually interesting, the big to scale scan of this ship is just not utilized or shown properly and that annoys me when that is what this entire lure of this doc. Again, gripping enough but just so annoying on too many aspects.",False
13,5,Mostly filler,christinaflinn-48444,n/a,16/08/2025,"Disappointed. They claim this documentary will bring new information, but there was nothing really new in it, only how the ship had broke apart. Everything else has been proven before. Good if your new into the history of Titanic, a good way to give you a decent oversight. It definitely focused well on the human tradgedy and heroism. But its mostly a filler documentary and apart from the 3D scan view it doesn't bring much to the table. There are better documentaries out there. It really felt like it was just a way for to try and drag out the info and give the scientists their 15 minutes of fame. Sometimes it felt as if they were speaking to the audiences like they are children and I personally hate that condescension.",False

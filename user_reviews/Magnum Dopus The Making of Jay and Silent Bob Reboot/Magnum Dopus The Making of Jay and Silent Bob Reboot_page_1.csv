1,7,"J&SBR Special Feature given a separate release, why?",eric20other2002,n/a,17/08/2025,"Home video releases has had many unfortunate changes over the years and this is another example. With J&SBR, there was a quick release with a decent amount of special features, but no commentary, then Kevin Smith did a YouTube track for it.Here we have a documentary on the making of the film that for some reason wasn't included on that release. Perhaps it was licensing rights because it was directed by Josh Roush. Of course this isn't the 1st time a making of ended up on another release. The J&SBSB making of went onto Vulgar's DVD release for some reason.The film itself is a well done film.",False
2,6,hanging out with old friends,SnoopyStyle,n/a,17/08/2025,This is a documentary from Kevin Smith on making his movie. The first ten minutes is about the genesis drama. It talks about the logistics of the movie rights. There is Jason Mewes' recovery from drug use and Kevin's heart attack. The rest of over an hour is basically behind-the-scenes stuff and that stuff has no real drama. It's DVD stuffing. It's a little overstuffed but this seems more for family and friends. Fans will like this fine. There are some fun stuff. Mostly it's bringing in the various actors to sing their praises. It's fine for fans.,False

1,7,The kind of mysteries Netflix should be involved with! [+68%],arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love stories about small towns. So, this one really intrigued me from the get-go. The piece begins with the (ten) inhabitants talking about their decision to move to Larrimah in the first place, and what they love about it. We then move to the mystery of a missing man and the filters of suspicion suddenly switch on. Frankly, the slow-burn reveals of the townsfolk surprised me one after the other. Not only do some hold major grudges against the rest, but they're also completely open about it.The aesthetics of the place (and its people) had my attention throughout. The pub with the crocodile, the pie shop, the bush, the stilt houses, the large open spaces, the dogs, the sunsets - there's something about the place that even a complete outsider like me can get drawn to. The interviews are spread out between all of the residents of the town, and everyone gets to voice their thoughts. The place, the story of the missing man, the people (their ongoing grudges and motives) - I feel this has everything needed for a neo-noir crime drama, at least on paper. It's predominantly Australian too - like, where else do you see folks candidly talk about murder while chugging beer, smoking, or laughing their butt off?",False
2,7,"This is such a quirky, but interesting documentary.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Larrimah is an Australian town with only ten residents, until recently it has eleven, only Paddy was killed, The Police believed that Paddy's adversary killed him, and the motive was pies...What a fascinating story this is, not the usual documentary I opt for on Netflix, but it's totally engaging.I loved the pacing, early on I didn't quite know which way it was heading, it all seemed sweet and lovely, with some very interesting and very open people, but as it develops, the scandals and open hatred comes seeping through.I honestly couldn't believe some of the revelations, wow, there was some real resentment, and in a town of eleven people, that was likely to cause problems.It's a little padded out in parts, but the interviews are so interesting, especially the lady from the pie shop. So many characters.What an incredible place, it really does look like a place that has once seen better days, but is somewhat off even that pace.Very entertaining.7/10.",False
3,8,Tiger King in the Aussie Outback.,rochfordsimon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWithout any tigers involved, this documentary reminded me of Tiger King. Plenty of drama and feuds between a tiny community.It's 2 x 50 min episodes. It doesn't drag and all the information is squeezed in perfectly. For a town of 11 residents , the entertainment and stories flow as good as any top shelf soap opera.It's also very funny at times. Plenty of thought provoking scenarios in this 'Who Done it?' Documentary.It is a real little gem of a find. I surfed into on Netflix and watched both episodes back to back. This would make a great film or mini-series.You get a glimpse into the sad, boring lives of people who have chosen to spend decades in a human dust pond.",True
4,7,How bizarre,rlbrooke,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ok, weird anomaly watching ""Last stop in Larrimah"", after watching ""Pain Hustlers"", ""Transparent"" inadvertently!!. I'm a true blue Aussie and obviously now a Jay Duplass fan without knowing it. I'd heard the podcast and the visual will hope help find the culprit. Worth the watch!Pure coincidence in hitting the button to watch this informative documentary but insightful to the going's of the outback especially where a missing person/murder has occurred (think Pete Falconio) for us regional mob or the city slickers and I guess the rest of the world. Maybe they'll keep us updated on news as it comes, but won't hold my breath!!!!",False
5,9,Fargo in Aussie,Marathonmax,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was great. They way the story is told, will keep you guessing. Guessing which side you're on. They cinematography is really well excecuted and the line up of real life characters is unbeliveable. A gem for the true crime audiences out there. But it also tells the tale of humans- humans with too much time on their hands, living in the middle of nowhere, drinking the day away, just being.I kind of want to go visit the town now, that i feel like i know everybody there. Meet the colorful characters, have a beer, and talk about what REALLY happened that night Paddy went missing. Great, great documentary.",False
6,6,Wake in fright Ostraya!,glenaobrien,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen an old bloke disappears from a remote town in the Northern Territory, half way between Darwin and Tennant Creek, the hunt is on to find his killer. For a town of 11 people there's probably more than enough seething hatred to go around and inspire a bunch more murders. For goodness' sake what is wrong with people? We almost seem to love to hate or at least find pleasure in making our neighbours out to be the worst monsters on earth. If you have the Pollyanna outlook that 'people are basically good' leave your optimism at the door, friends, because this movie will knock the wind out of your sails quicker than a goanna up a gumtree.The ineptness of the police investigation at least adds some humour and the director leaves in place some of the worst interview takes to underscore their hapless attempt to secure a conviction. By the end of the series there's a huge flashing neon sign saying, 'Here's the guy who did it', but poor old Paddy's body is still out there somewhere rotting in the scrub (or maybe in the belly of a croc) while his killer remains free. This would make a good double feature with Jesse O'Brien's horror comedy, Two Heads Creek (2019), though here the murder and mayhem are real. Wake in fright, mate, for this is Ostraya!",True
7,10,Land of plenty feuds,Roma73,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love Fargo (the film), you'll probably enjoy this as a real life whodunnit, with a wealth of eccentric Fargo-like characters, each and every one of them far stranger than fiction.In a nutshell, this true story revolves around 11 people who are the sole inhabitants of a tiny villlage off the beaten track in northern Australia. Did I say 11? I mean 10. One of them has mysteriously disappeared, presumably murdered. You'd think with such a meagre population it wouldn't be too difficult to narrow down a suspect or two, right? Yeah, unless the potential murder victim had more than a few enemies among his ten-fold brethren.To further complicate matters, the remaining ten don't like (any of) each other much either, and that's me putting it very mildly.This 2 episode series is hard to compare with anything else, but I can say this: the individuals who tell the story - Larrimah's population, all of them potential suspects (and some cops from the nearest glimpse of civilization) - had me completely absorbed. There's lots to say about them, but it's hard to find the words, I assure you. And if you have yet to watch this, the less said the better.",False
8,7,A fabulous true story but direction falls a little short,jjolla888,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn intriguing docuseries whodunnit from a tiny township will keep you glued for its entirety.However, i found that i was searching for a bit more context throughout. For example, the individuals were interviewed at various points in time and in various locations .. but it was not made clear when and where. Nor was it explained the economics of the place, particularly since some of the friction came from selling pies. Perhaps this was done on purpose to keep the audience guessing right to the end.I couldn't help but pull up the google and find out more about Larrimah the town .. only to note that the population around the time, as reported by census, was 47 people. The latest estimate (as of 2023) has it at 10 .. so maybe the harping on 11-to-10 drop is a bit of stretching the truth to get a great story.Overall a great watch - you get to see a really remote town - coincidentally on the same stretch of highway that the British tourist Peter Falconio was murdered in 2001 (and also with plenty of controversy about how he died)",True
9,9,Original and interesting,JR_1_,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLarrimah redefines 'small town'. Almost everyone is a murder suspect in this town, with a population of 10 citizens, and almost everyone had an altercation or feud with Patrick Moriarty. It is a very interesting documentary. To see the once thriving Larrimah be run into the ground, by its own residents, was very sad. The clashes between the neighbours seems petty at first, but we soon learn that the tension run much deeper and darker than expected. I felt sympathy for Fran Hodgetts. I do not believe she was treated fairly by those interviewing her and the filmmakers. Instead, it looked like there was attempts to make her into a laughing stock, purely based on her eccentric personality. The things she said about Patrick in the past footage was edited and replayed to make her seem suspicious or the likely murderer - but on reflection, anyone who had a feud with someone would say similar tongue in cheek phrases such as 'What goes around comes around'. Nothing she said screamed 'Murderer' to me, and as we see at the end of the documentary, it is fairly obvious who the likely killer is. I expected the town to crumble as the documentary was coming to a close, however I was surprised at how pleased and emotional I was to see that there is new hope for Larrimah. Hopefully the new and old residents can learn from past mistakes and build a promising future together. I have every hope.",True
10,8,"Rather Intriguing Fargo, Australia",helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was quite a surprise and I found myself intrigued from beginning to end- a very quirky, frustrating, enigmatic tale of the murder of someone who may or may not have been a great Irish immigrant, may or may not have been a great neighbor, may or may not have been a pot-stirrer, and his dog (NO NOT THE DOG!!) neither of which deserved to be killed in cold blood for nothing in particular.The residents are a menagerie of characters- some of which feel quite slimy- amongst them Fran and Owen, of which seem to be painted in an unflattering light yet they do absolutely nothing to help themselves fight the portrayal. They're both quite vitriolic and full of blame for all their problems on anyone but themselves. Then there's Karen and.her husband, but she seems to like the camera more than her husband. The name definitely seems to fit, as she epitomizes it in virtually every way possible.So many people are castigated by the others, including a lot of whining, miserable miscreants who can't seem to find a way to keep a business afloat yet keep plenty busy with keeping the rumor mill running full steam, having no problem with tossing ridiculous accusations and nonsensical claims with absolutely no regard for the man who has been missing and presumed dead or those they happen to share a community with.All that being said, it's a seemingly lighthearted and somewhat cheeky true crime documentary but never loses sight of the fact that an innocent man lost his life and has never been heard from again. It's a rather interesting story told in a fascinating way that's a fresh new way, so be prepared for every budding artist to now put their spin on this and fill the void with some of the insipid work the genre has seen since Jimmy Hoffa went for a walk.",False
11,4,Bad Day at Outback,jgreco7,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere's a-feuding and a-fussing and a-fighting in Netflix's documentary ""Last Stop Larrimah,"" population eleven, minus one, all in all, a homey expose of the simple pleasures in the land-down-under: beer, meat pies, the great outdoors, beer, man's best friend, and deep-rooted, festering, personal animosities.In a way, the outback is Australia's badlands, where life is close to the land until it's eventually underneath it. For some, like local eccentric, Paddy Moriarty, whose head meets with a hammer, maybe too soon.There's larceny in the heartland, so it seems, and intense loathing, bitterness, heaps of grudges and accusations, but worst of all, insanity where there ought to be sanctuary. The inhabitants of misery's reward, this narcoleptic watering hole, have forsaken modesty and a shirt, to air their petty grievances, with some reluctant remorse, over the course of five years. Wasted effort, it seems, for a lot of ornery Aussies, one transplanted Irishman, and a dog.",True
12,8,Well made and actually funny.,deloudelouvain,n/a,16/08/2025,"Last Stop Larrimah is a well made true crime documentary about the disappearance of Paddy, an Irish immigrant, in Larrimah, situated in Australia, in the middle of nowhere. Larrimah: population eleven... that says already enough about the locals you will encounter there. I immediately had to think about Wrong Turn or The Hills Have Eyes. No need to say the people living there are a bit ""special"". Only eleven people but still a lot of hatred towards each other, not really the idyllic lifestyle you would imagine. Almost every single person is interviewed and they brought some smiles on my face. I actually found a lot of their stories funny even if there's obviously a serious crime commited. It's all very well shot, interesting to follow. I always dreamed about living off grid somewhere in the middle of nowhere, but there? No, thank you, I'll pass for that.",False
13,10,Exceptionally well researched!,rebeccadburgess,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerRIP Paddy Moriarty.I literally signed on just to give a review for a greatly portrayed Aussie doco/investigation.Thanks for giving each town player a voice too.Was it Richard who said there's two sides of a story and the truth is somewhere in between?Or something to that effect. You guys really captured the heart of Larrimah. I cried at the ending.Peter Allen gets me every time.Each new piece of evidence has you on the edge of your seat secretly convicting the next person who is spoken about poorly by their 10 person town neighbour.I love that Larrimah's legacy lives on in the young new blood that is now running in its veins! I hope Larrimah's new baby gets to write a whole new story for the town!I was going to stop there but I need 600 words so good luck to the crocodile as well.Maybe there will be some little baby reptiles kicking around town soon.Perhaps someone will invest in reviving the tourist park.What else?Part 3?Ok. I'm still going apparently.I LOVE WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE.I HOPE WE FIND PADDY AND HIS DOG.PLEASE MAKE YOUR NEXT INVESTIGATION ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THE WIEAMBILLA KILLINGS!,True
14,10,The plot thickens like Fran's pie gravy..,southaussie62,n/a,16/08/2025,"So, I watched this yesterday, and I really enjoyed it. It starts off with some interesting characters living in a very uninteresting town in the middle of nowhere. Early on we get a closer look at the characters (11 in total) and their backgrounds. There's Fran the pie lady that's lived there forever and who lays claim to establishing the town, and Paddy the Irishman who arrived from Ireland years ago, who on his way to wherever on arriving in Australia decided the trip was taking too long so stop and decided to settle down in Larrimah. Initially it seems Paddy is liked by everyone. Problem is it's hard to find anyone Paddy has a good word to say about! What is revealed about the townsfolk when the police arrive to investigate Paddy's subsequent disappearance is eye-opening. All is not what it seems in this seemingly chummy little town. Very well put together with lots of things you just can't help laugh about. The ending is unexpected, though not surprising, and for me at least it pointed the finger clearly at the murderer. There should be more doco's like this one that keep you guessing right to very end.",False
15,1,"Embarrassing, boring and not an endearing character in sight",sallymichellenelson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Too slow to be that boring.It's basically an episode of ""Days of our lives"" Aussie bush version.Maybe this is a typical small Aussie bush town but damn did they have to live up to all out crappy stereotypes?! How embarrassing
The alcoholism is at the centre. They'd have to all be drunk driving every day. Disgusting.The cussing like it's normal. Classy.Living in a town with so few people is asking for trouble. Not only are troubled people attracted to towns in the middle of nowhere but familiarity breeds contempt and it certainly did here. U won't like these ""characters"".Xxx.xxxxxxzzzzzz.",False
16,4,A waste of almost two hours Yo!,kmcgrath1488,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI thought eventually they may come to a resolution about the disappearances of one of the residents and his dog but after a long boring slog of interviews with mostly totally unlikeable residents you are left hanging. Every resident seems to have a serious drinking problem and if this is a sample of how things are in the rest of the country then their AA meetings are overflowing. The residents all seem to hate police in general and their investigations seem to be rather amateurish. Their main investigation technique seems to be considering everyone a person of interest and browbeating them to confess. HBO must be desperate for content by airing this mess Yo!,True

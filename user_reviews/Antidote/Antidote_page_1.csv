1,8,Antidote,andrewlullman,n/a,15/08/2025,A truly moving film of how Russian's leader inhumanly murders opponents by poison and whatever else. Every moment is worthwhile watching. It shows that democracy doesn't exit in Russia like it does in Ukraine and less in America today than it did before. It also examines an extraordinarily kind hero who tries to inform the world of a blatant dictatorship that needs to be abolished. While maintaining his family and supporting his daughter. It also reviews Biden and Europes exchange of actually killers for individuals imprisoned because of their opposition on Putin. It is a very meaningful film having been to Ukraine and Russia in the past.,False

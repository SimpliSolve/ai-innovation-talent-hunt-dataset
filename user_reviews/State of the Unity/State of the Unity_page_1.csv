1,9,A message of unity!,churkj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Had the pleasure of viewing this documentary recently. Even though it was filmed back in 2016, the message could not be more true today. A simple(yeah right) drive across the 50 states in a Volvo station wagon on the brink of destruction, and a profound thought of what brings people together. Nathaniel and Jillian share this message through stories, and their own music. Without giving anything away it is amazing to see walls that people build up be torn down when they open their minds and hearts to something greater. This is definitely a message that should be shared today. Unity is not an idea, but ultimately a changing of the heart.",False
2,10,The Real Deal,rebeccachurch-23985,n/a,16/08/2025,"State of the Unity was a great film about 2 very genuine people trying to unite people of all backgrounds. It obviously wasn't an easy task if you watch the film. Living one gig to the next trying to spread a message all people should consider was a leap of faith. They used their gifts to bring love, laughter, generosity, perspective, and unity to a country that needs it now more than ever. Jillian and Nate are the real deal. They are genuinely kind and loving people with a desire to make the world a better place. They are raw in their experiences. They don't hold back. If you like passion, encouragement, and hope, give it a go!",False
3,10,A message of connection and hope!,denisedk-77443,n/a,16/08/2025,"My husband and I have watched state of the unity twice. Why? Because we found it so completely inspiring. What Jillian and Nathaniel are doing may seem like a small thing, but we found its impact to be quite large. We believe they are creating ripples on a pond with each signature on that car, ripples on a pond that will continue to go out throughout the world and cause acts and thoughts of unity, compassion and connection. These are the actions that we need in the world right now in order for us to progress in a positive way. The light that emanates from the two of them is causing such a connection with the people that they encounter that we know that anyone who watches this documentary will be inspired. We highly recommend you watch this documentary!",False
4,1,"Self-serving ""feel good"" doc loaded with toxic positivity",slark-02877,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTalk about tooting your own horn. If this documentary was produced by someone other than the main characters, it might have turned out okay. Instead we see two people really trying so hard to make themselves the center of attention. All of their ""on the road"" problems were self-inflicted. The whole things smacks of toxic positivity. It's less about actually bringing people together and more about how much the filmmakers can make themselves look good and promote their own music careers. Once you realize how much these two crave the spotlight and will do anything to get it, the whole film becomes practically laughable.",True
5,10,Unique Story,katemdinolfo,n/a,16/08/2025,In a time where people are afraid to stand on their truths this is a inspiring peace by those who aren't afraid.In isn't often where you see people advocating for peace over division. I've often wondered how the health of the individual and the earth would be different if we ended these eras of fighting with unity.Personally I've seen how lack of acceptance for difference has torn friendships and families apart - for what benefit? None. We don't have the right to force people to conform to our perception of the world if they don't see use foe it. We can only shine as we are and encourage others do to the same.,False
6,10,A Road Trip to Unity!,kristikidwell,n/a,16/08/2025,"My husband and I attended a musical performance by The Bergamot in Sedona. During the performance Nathaniel and Jillian spoke about their journey in making The State of the Unity. Throughout their performance they talked about opening your heart to others we think are different from us, and how we have more in common than we think. This led us to The State of Unity documentary.We loved this documentary in its pursuit to bring people together to share their common messages of hope, love, and encouragement. The Unity Car is truly the vehicle that draws the curious in, along with the gentle lead of two talanted and generous spirited musicians who want to see a kinder country. The film illuminates the fact that people, opposite in political or ideological perspectives, mirror one another in their desire for connection and respect. A main message communicated in many defining moments within the film is; while we have our differences, we also have much in common, which can serve as our foundation of acceptance and understanding.Watch this movie and feel your heart grow a few sizes bigger!Kristi and Mark.",False
7,10,Worth all the tears!,kasiaperkowska,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a sweet, inspiring movie - it's exactly what we all need right now! I love the fact that these two incredibly talented humans are using their talents for good. Spreading a message of love and diversity is exactly what we all need right now. The amount of tears I produced while watching this was pretty impressive - had me in all my feels. I don't know very much about movie production but I do know as someone who loves to watch them the movie was beautifully created with lots of home made videos that give my photographer heart the warm fuzzies. Keep doing what you're doing and we will be watching again!",False
8,10,Excellent Movie!,tonicrowderinfo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Last night, I had the privilege of seeing State of the Unity and I absolutely loved the movie! Jillian and Nate did an excellent job of bringing the audience along in the car right beside them. I was laughing, smiling and crying throughout the entire movie. I wish I had been taking notes of all the wonderful and deep sentiments shared during the film. I would certainly watch it again! After the movie, the couple gifted us with two beautiful songs and an interesting Q and A. They are just as warm and genuine in person as they seem in the film. I hope many others will see this movie and be inspired by what two people with hope, and a dream can accomplish. Watch the movie. It will be time well spent.",False
9,10,A message every heart could heal from,jchristine-87636,n/a,16/08/2025,"What I appreciate most about State Of The Unity is we don't know any of those people who showed up. We have no background of the lives they live or any poor decisions made. All we know is that love showed up and made a difference. Love created a movement.No matter anyone's mistakes, creed, or origin, everyone is deserving of what should have been so freely and purely given since birth - love.Not only love but acceptance. Because ultimately that is what love allows us to feel is accepted. Love gives us the opportunity to shed off any facade we've held up for far too long.... State Of The Unity links us all by a cord we've all so desperately needed help threading....",False
10,10,"Timely, Balanced, Skillful, Uplifting",shantiknight,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film reflects on the questions we've all been asking over the past seven years, finding our footing on land that often feels more like sand (or quicksand) than a solid oak wood floor. Seen through the lens of working artists, witnessing people from all 50 states sharing love, this film demonstrates the common threads that bring us together as people, that help us see the best in each other and believe that there's more to living in this day and age than just being right. Bolstered by academics, The Bergamot's inner thoughts, trials, and hypotheses feel relevant and, most importantly, hopeful. This is a film we need, that can be enjoyed by anybody and that will continue to bring us together for years to come.",False
11,10,Unity is the American Dream,melissapaigemaguire98,n/a,16/08/2025,I had the pleasure of attending a screening of State of the Unity and I cannot recommend the film enough! It is a beautiful documentary featuring a beautiful couple spreading love and togetherness through music and art. In todays world we are all guilty of becoming jaded and indifferent to each others plight and risk becoming disconnected. This films ethos and practices combat the notion at the seams. The positivity and light is contagious I dare you to watch the film and leave in a negative headspace it's not possible!!! I hope these two continue making art for social change for many years to come.,False
12,10,Wonderful message of positivity!,sggfpskzn,n/a,16/08/2025,"My wife and I recently had the pleasure of seeing a screening of the film State of the Unity. This film is about husband and wife duo who form the band The Bergamot. They travel across the country in a Volvo wagon to spread the message that there is more that unites us than divides us. As can be expected, there are setbacks and obstacles, but also beautiful moments of serendipity and connection. Their music and performances are interspersed as well as some input from experts on why we are so divided. Overall, it was a beautiful, uplifting message that if we take some time to actually see and know ""the other"", we find that we all mostly want the same things. See it if you get the chance! We all need a lot more positivity these days. This film delivers!",False
13,10,Soulful and deeply moving.,djzwcy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the best and most moving documentary I have seen in my lifetime. The love and compassion ebbs and flows through a great storyline. The love they share just plain moves you.. I weep at the sight of love, At Friday nights show I wept and then I wept some more.We saw this show at the Acorn theater in Three Oaks Michigan. I didn't know much about the Bergamots so much that when we were waiting for the show to start they had a picture of themselves on top of the car on the screen. I thought the car was just dirty, took me a few minutes to ask, is that writing on the car? Then I learnt.Wow what a soulful spirit led journey two humans who believe in the power of love and unity. This documentary isn't about challenging your beliefs, it's about honoring your beliefs and those of our neighbors. We humans have more in common than we care to share , the documentary brings that to light.We need this movement now more than we did in 2016. With 35% of people reporting they have severed a significant relationship over the last ten years. Unity and love is the way out. Peace, Tim.",False
14,10,A shining light of hope in this challenging world,bconklinmk,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is timely and timeless, capturing a beautiful portrait of The United States of America at its core.It depicts our foundational values on which we were founded including: unity, freedom, and love.This documentary embraces the true soul of our country that often goes unseen or unreported because negatively takes precedence. Nathaniel and Jillian offer a perspective of hope and positivity amidst the deep rifts we are all experiencing.The reality of life encompasses great difficulties as well as incredibly joyful moments when we choose to seek it out. Thank you for promoting light and love!",False
15,10,"Shine ON, Unity Collective!",jcherry-15259,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed State of the Unity. As a follower of their band The Bergamot for many years, the film provided me an intimate and honest view into the trials of life on the road in pursuit of a dream, as well as a sense of the generally goodness of people across the country. Jillian & Nathaniel's passion, curiosity, determination, and radical empathy radiate from the screen. I thoroughly enjoyed the thought leadership from Pat Ashton and David Anderson Hooker, who's message that what's important is not a shared vision of the future but rather a vision of a shared future really hit home. It's interesting to compare this 2016 experience with today's social climate to see how far we've come and how far we have to go to become more unified. Change starts with individual actions, and State of the Unity strengthened my belief in that.",False

1,7,An interesting look at the Indonesian legal system,atleverton,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is very good at dissecting the intricacies of the Indonesian legal system and add laying there its flaws. While the Indonesian legal system is certainly unique within the world, it seems that this case is problematic for the reason that many other cases in the world are problematic - media attention. Sometimes I wonder if it would be a better system when you were accused, charged, tried of a crime in secret. That way if you were innocent no one would ever know that you had been accused of a crime, and if you are guilty then your trial has more of a chance to be a fair one without the glare of the media. Of course that system also would probably lead to abuses of power as well. This is an interesting documentary that plays more like a sensationalistic film.",False
2,7,Fascinating story,aggelosandreou-17839,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOkay so I'm not Indonesian and I had never heard the story before. I can understand that there is a lot of emotion around the case, but as a ""third eye"" and a European with experience of a vastly different legal system, I tend to agree that the suspect was treated unfairly. To my mind, you can't convict someone without demonstrating direct and hard evidence. I'm not saying Jessica didn't kill her but I can't say with confidence that she did. There is no motive, no evidence, nothing. Just a mafia-style father celebrating his win over a young woman.As a documentary, it's your typical netflix crime doc.",True
3,6,"An interesting case, but too long.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"A detailed look at the trial of Jessica Wongso, who was arrested and charged for murdering her best friend, Mirna Salihin, by spiking her iced coffee with cyanide.It's a little over long, this could have been edited down into less than an hour, at times it's very slow and padded, which is a shame, as there's some good content.It's a fairly interesting documentary, the case itself is pretty interesting, bud it's more of a study of Indonesia's legal system, being from The UK, it seems totally alien, one thing that doesn't differ around the world however, the scrutiny of the public and media.I have actually been to Indonesia, I don't actually think this does anything to promote the country, it pretty much takes aim, and fires two barrels at the country, detailing the country's legal system failings, as well as the bias that exists.Was Jessica guilty? I'm not convinced that this case was black and white.6/10.",False
4,7,Anti climax ending,andarswesa,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film does not conduct an interview with Hani. Who could be the key witness. Because he was a colleague of the victim and perpetrator who was at the scene of the crime. Many other trial facts were not revealed. This film is more of a dramatization of the feud between Edi Darmawan Salihin as Mirna's Father and Otto Hasibuan as Jesicca's Lawyer. Perhaps the aim of this documentary is to reveal the weakness of law enforcement and justice in Indonesia. Even if that is true, it seems unethical to take advantage of the perpetrator and the victim's surviving family. As if opening an old wound that hasn't healed yet. The ending is anti-climactic, leaving the audience with their own assumptions and perceptions, without a clear conclusion.",True
5,7,An Alarming Look at the Indonesian Legal System,andrewobriandunlap,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The (Indonesian) criminal justice system needs to be reformed."" That was probably the truest statement made in this documentary, which could also summarize the entire movie.Their ""expert"" witnesses were highly dubious to say the least. They literally brought in a physiognomist (a sort of pseudoscientist judging someone's character based on their facial features) to testify in court! I was flabbergasted! I will not reveal the verdict in my review, so as to avoid spoilers. I have my own suspicions and probably agreed with the outcome. But suffice to say the methods they used to reach that outcome were shockingly backwards and therefore I think the verdict should have been different.Obviously there are many beautiful aspects of the diverse Indonesian culture and people, but after watching this documentary I will not be planning a trip there anytime soon. No place is perfect, certainly not my own country (United States). But this documentary revealed some serious and frightening flaws in their society. I think it's worth a look, especially if you have even a passing interest in Indonesia.",False
6,6,"I felt I was watching a B Movie, but",corretorfabiovieira,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ungornately, this is a real live crime.When I was watching it, I almost forgot that that happened for real.It seemed to me that I was warching a B movie with a nad script and argument that nobody would believe. Unless you were a Indonesian Justice Member.What a shame.Everytime I see this kind of situation, I confirm the ideia that we have to much to evolve yet.Here in Brazil we have these kind of justice as well.The specialists that are more interested in look good in pictures than protect the truth.Nobody cares about the other people as long as they can perform their futile show.",False
7,7,She 1000% Did It,sajecha,n/a,16/08/2025,"She is absolutely a murderer. I just saw an YouTube interview with Jessica Wongso and she didn't even make any sense on anything. She was laughing and smiling in the entire interview. She never apologized for anything. She didn't even remember anything that happened that the interviewer asked.If you thought or had an inclining that she was innocent then think again and scratch that idea because her explanation of everything was so weird and so suspicious.She had 8 years to at least come up with an excuse, a reason, or something but her explanations were so exasperating.She 1000% did it and then has the nerves to deny it.The interview is in 7 News Spotlight YouTube Channel.",False
8,1,Does not paint Indonesia in a good light,shigantic,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you go by this, everyone in Indonesia is insanely vain and vapid. Their legal system is an absolute joke, with everyone involved believing and relying on science and arguments that would be laughed out of any other court in the world. The attention seeking father of the deceased woman was allowed to bring a gun into the court room, as well as place a doctored photo into evidence that was only at the last second discovered and removed. Every high school debate tournament I've seen has been head and shoulders above this country's highest court. Looks like there's a new entrant in the way too crowded race to see who can recreate the world from Idiocracy first.",False
9,5,More a story of the Indonesian Legal System - Scary,thejdrage,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being from a legal family (American), I watched to see how it's done in Indonesia.Now that country is off my bucket list!The two things I took away from this documentary is: The family dictates how far a coroner can go in an autopsy. In this one, the police wanted a full autopsy, but the family didn't allow that. In this instance, they allowed only small blood samples. Nothing in depth.Second - If you are not beautiful (and in the definition of Indonesian beauty), you are guilty - automatically in the eyes of everyone observing the trial!! Innocence is being beautiful! OMG! You can't make this stuff up!What's unfair is that it (probably) gives a bad and unfair view of an entire country.But back to the documentary, it's odd and long. The film clips are often the same.If you need something to pass the time, or to iron to (Google it!), pay bills, do dishes, this is it.",False
10,10,Thank you Netflix,wozpn,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn Indonesia where you can be sentenced to 20 years without any evidence. Absolutely disaster for Indonesian judicial system. You can listen yourself from the father saying: ""This is the longest, the most explosive the most historical ever, Killing without evidence, they put in jail for 20 years i convinced the prosecutors and the judges. Thats how it ended, happy ending. I win."". For those who still supports Jessica to stay in Jail, please wake up. One day if this case were to happen to you and yet authority had no evidence and yet you were blamed and yet you were sentenced for 20 years. Welcome to Indonesia. Be very careful.",True
11,1,The Worst Netflix Documentary,haniffavirgiasari,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would say that i'm quite a big fan of Netflix Documenteries.But this one is really bring it down, i could say like that just because im that intense following this case since day oneAnd there are so many important details information during court is unrecorded in this Netflix film😩First questions, is why is Hani the one who's sit together with them ( Mirna & Jessica ) didnt get interviewed at all?!I think its really important to asked her, because she is the one who's in that emergency situation.For me this is more likely a youtube documenter instead of Netflix,Overall, i regret to watch this, cause its just waste a time😔",False
12,2,Victim's Dad & Editing Made This Unwatchable,lauren_blair,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love true crime, I've seen most docs out there. This was a very hard watch - not because of a traumatic crime, but because this is a horrendously made documentary. A very interesting case, but I genuinely learnt nothing from this documentary. The actual victim, Mirna, was barely mentioned - however her intensely unlikeable father was in it waaaay too much. He was smug, arrogant and genuinely seemed to believe that he was a hero and worldwide celebrity. He forged and planted evidence, brought a gun to court and seemed to thrive on his overinflated ego. Why did they give him so much air time??The editing of the timeline of the murder jumped around so much and the facts of the case were so poorly presented. It seems like the actual case was barely spoken about; it was all about the trial and far too much focus on random people's opinions. No background info on the victim or killer, no real interviews with witnesses of the crime, no explanation as to why cyanide was apparently proven not to be the cause of death... Why was there more information on the defence lawyer's golf course (?) name and the prosecutor's new car than a possible motive for the murder (which they all bizarrely say isn't that important) or how Jessica actually got cyanide in the first place??The courtroom footage itself was absolutely disgusting and shocking. That's not necessarily the documentary maker's fault, but why was there such a focus and so much footage of the horrible circus of a trial..? People clapping, cheering, laughing continuously throughout was really jarring. And WHY were there so many 'experts' but they all seemed to testify as if they'd just rolled out of bed? I genuinely was shocked hearing the man present evidence of Jessica being the killer because of the shape her eyes made, and how his scientific basis came from watching movie stars. Why did the documentary not lean into that angle, about the absolute farce of the trial?I still don't know what relevance half the interviewees really had to the story. I still don't know what the prosecution argued in order to get a conviction, or why all of sudden after the defence's expert witness was deported that the lawyer went from ""we are 100% winning this"" to ""we knew we would lose now"". What..? Because of one random 'expert'?? What was the bit about with opening the bottle in court? There'd been zero information about a bottle leading up to that, then a brief mention that the coffee was transferred to the bottle. Still no idea why it was opened in court. What was the bit about a bribe too??I'm going to read up on the case as the tiny bit of information the documentary *did* provide was intriguing, but the documentary was a waste of time.Also, Netflix - don't create a trailer that says ""there was a rumour of a love triangle between Jessica, Mirna and her husband"" and ""there were alleged ties to the mafia"" and then not mention it ONCE in the doc. There was like one line on Mirna and Jessica being lovers but that was never explained.The one thing I learnt is that there are some people in the world stupid enough to take a sip of discoloured, sharp-smelling coffee that your customer just drank and is now convulsing on the ground. My jaw literally dropped at that. I need a full documentary on this woman tbh.",False
13,10,One of the best,sirroc-88375,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie is to show on how corrupt Indonesia law system is. It doesnt matter if Jessica ordered coffee prior, or showed no emotion or her facial shape or her chinese western zodiac etc, as long as the fact that the cause of death was not firmed, no autopsy and non cyanide evidence in dead body and yet Jessica was still sentenced to 20 years in jail. It just showed Wow wow wow and wow to Indonesian law system. Be caution foreigners. Make sure to think twice to come to Indonesia and pray you dont get in trouble with the law or authority. It looked like money talked a lot and can buy law in Indonesia.",True
14,1,Frozen in disappointment,Coldmistyocean,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary falls short in several aspects, leaving viewers disappointed.One major flaw is the bad editing, which disrupts the flow of the narrative. The documentary fails to provide a clear explanation of the murderer's motives and actions, leaving viewers puzzled.Moreover, the unnecessary and potentially misleading explanations throughout the film can be frustrating. For example, portraying the victim's father as a mafia figure without sufficient context can be misleading and irrelevant to the central story.The most concerning aspect is the documentary's potential to inadvertently glorify the murderer, as it seems to give her undue attention and fame. Overall, it leaves much to be desired and may not be worth your time.",False
15,2,Indonesian flop,d_penn,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe case of the century - in Indonesia
Calling this the case of the century is a bit wild. I mean, yes, the interest was huge, but the case itself is virtually non-existent in terms of evidence. Not that this keeps the accused out of jail.The true crime case has to do with the murder of Mirna Salihin. The accused is Jessica Wongso, her friend, who is currently serving time in an Indonesian prison. Jessica supposedly put cyanide in Mirna's iced coffee, but there's no actual evidence that proves this.In fact, there's no real proof that Mirna even died from cyanide poisoning. Not any that we hear in this documentary. Quite the opposite. Also, there's talk of the ice coffee smelling awful which doesn't really jive with the whole cyanide thing. Not that this is really talked about in the documentary which is just one strange thing.Overall, the documentary is just very lacking in many things and tends to skip lots of details that are otherwise interesting.",True
16,8,This open the eyes of many people,johnylim,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary so good to cover both side. And true the trial was kinda forced, and it spike new movement to Indonesia netizen.The lawyer, judge, father of Mirna, and many other people who related to this case was appeared in many podcast.Netizen found many more Oddities from one of the judge, prof Edward, and Mr. Edy salihin.Many of their statement was countered by netizen with other old record of the trial and interview.They Suspect one of the Judge unreasonable getting so rich after the trial End, meanwhile Mr.edi salihin was broke now.Some of the statement like ""Jessica goes to the cafe 3 day before the Incident"" was countered and Prof edward who made that statement already confirmed he was mistaken.The movie lack many thing:they didn't tell Jessica was on Singapore the day before the incident.there is no original DVR/Harddrive, it suspiciously gone missingthe cctv video footage was doctored, the cctv spec on that cafe is 1920x1080 25fps, meanwhile the ""cctv"" video in the trial was awfully bad, it just 960*576 10fpsONE of the police whose handle this case (Ferdi Sambo) was arrested 2022 ago For premeditated murder and OBSTRUCTION of JUSTICE and drag 65 other polices with him to the trial, some of them did a manipulation of cctv, the body, crime scene and the case, they make the ""victim"" looks like the ""suspect"" whose did bad thing to Sambo wife, turn out the real suspect is Sambo itself.And many more other things.Thanks to netflix, they really show how fragile Indonesia law here, ""Money rules the law""",True
17,3,"Fascinating case, sun- par documentary",fkffycky,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA very poorly made documentary about an extremely interesting case!To me it feels like the producers had an agenda to convince viewers that Jessica was innocent and have done this with some seriously Cherry picked court scenes and interviewsQuestions I had were-
Why wasn't Hani, the primary WITNESS of Mirna's death, interviewed?Why was only a mere one or two sentences from an interview with Arief, Mirna's husband, shown? You would think he would have had a lot of insight into Jessica and Mirna's friendship that should be extremely relevant, no?Where were scenes of testimony from the above people in addition to the testimonies of the cafe staff?Why were the interviews with the toxicologist so lacking? No explanation is offered about how cyanide is metabolised in the body over time, how it may present in tissues, blood samples over time to potentially explain or prove wrong the contentious results that were the basis of the defense' case
Why were the producers so obsessed with zooming in on Mirna's father's watch, ring and gun continuously? A pathetic attempt
To imply he's in the mafia perhaps but also why and to what end? The documentary offers no insight into the significance of his maybe mafia affiliations to the story of Mirna's murder which begs the question- why is this relevant at all then?Why did it gloss over Jessica's past in Australia!?!? The doco uses a line from one interview where someone says ""those are separate issues"" and decides not to go there, doesn't explore the MULTIPLE suicide attempts and boyfriend taking out a restraining order.. or the incident where she crashed her car into a nursing home? I would think this is pertinent to Jessica's complex character and therefore enormously relevant!Frankly I'm utterly convinced it was Jessica, but I would have loved to see an exploration of who she is, with an empathetic lens perhaps.",True
18,3,A Youtube Documenter,tania_mutiara,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why wasn't Hani, who was with Mirna and Jessica, interviewed at all?I think this is crucial to address because she was in the middle of the emergency situation.This film feels more like a YouTube documentary than something you'd expect on Netflix.Asking random people on the street about the case makes it seem like the production team was trying too hard to stretch the content.Additionally, Jessica Wongso, as the accused, barely gets a chance to speak, which makes the documentary even less valuable.The film mostly rehashes past events without providing any new or meaningful information to the audience.This documentary showcases to a global Netflix audience that the Indonesian justice system is still chaotic-if you have money, you have power.",False
19,1,Not worth your time,tumisbuncis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let me save you your time. This documentary is not worth to watch.Not only was it poorly edited, it was also very draggy. If you heard about this case once, you probably already know it better than what this show is giving you. The documentary was to confuse the audience with unreliable and unnecessary opinions. Asking random people on the street about the case makes it look like the production are trying too hard to put content in the show. Too much fluff, not enough gist. 30 minutes of this was more than enough.It's more like a battle between the father and Otto the lawyer rather than a commemoration of the victim. Otto was just saving face for losing the case, and for him it was never about fighting for justice or truth; it's just for him to win. The father was on the show just to be on the show. Very little regard, or even respect of the deceased.Remember who is the real villain here; the production house took advantage on a 7 year old story, disregarding anyone who cares about the deceased, all the while reaping the profits. It's truly shameless.This show is giving Jessica, the killer, the 15 seconds spotlight she has been craving all this time. If you'd like to contribute to that, you might enjoy this circus shitshow.",False
20,9,"GOOD SOLID DOCUMENTARY,",pik923,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHard to write about this without giving information about the film. Justice system in a Muslim run semi-dictatorship with the police and Justice system completely powerful, always interested in seeking and providing 'guilty' verdicts.Islam today is unquestionably misogynist. Indonesia is today unquestionably misogynist.May I suggest you watch the entire documentary - don't miss a word the translation because most of it is in subtitles.Watch how the court worked with and without evidence, the testimonies of experts that will floor you for sure....Personally I'm convinced the father of the murdered young woman has deep connections with the judges - yes I'll even say bribed...and the treatment of Jessica after the verdict is equally as horrendous.Something is very wrongCongratulations to the brave film makers.",True
21,4,Mehh,raspecwamen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJessica was sketchy.. but Mirna's family didn't allow autopsy.. so you can't really determine the C. O. D.. it really could be natural cause..
Also the part where the soap opera actress was so cringe and unnecessary. .I think Otto did ask good questions during the trial. Both sides didn't really have enough evidence. If only autopsy has been done, the outcome would have been different. Maybe Mirna's family is hiding something.. who knows? But the judgement was already there before the trial even started. Weird thing is the cafe's CCTV has good footage for everything, but not the one facing the table where they were sitting.Overall it was not that good.. not that bad either.. has justice been served? Don't think so.. I cannot really tell if Jessica did kill Mirna.The barista in the end smiling while talking about Indonesians got killed by coffee? Dude....",True
22,5,A tail of two college friends that ends in mystery and tragedy,kayec-39927,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMore to do with the story than the movie. Very distressing and confusing in its entirety to say the least. Of course I'm so saddened for the deceased but towards the mid part of the netflix film I had to have some support for Jessica. No disrespect intended but in a third world country I don't know if true justice exists to much corruption. Long story short, I was left with not knowing Mirnahs true cause of death and a possible innocent persons life was ruined. The country needs reform across the board, their modern way of thinking is shallow and materialistic don't know how sustaining that is. The film was however interesting, decently developed and complete.",True
23,1,Lowering-down the quality of netflix documentary!,ohertzz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Totally not a fair and well-balanced documentary (if we can call it documentary 😏). Too many leading opinions, bad framing on Mirna's father and prosecutor team, even showing piece of gossips and character judgement. What is this?I also keep wondering why should they only involved experts from Jessica's side? There were many strong experts' arguments from the other side as well. This one, indeed, lowering-down the quality of netlix documentary!And now, many people talking about this in social media. Influenced by their framing, defending Jessica, questioning judge's decission without seeing the case comprehensively from all sides. Congrats beach house! Congrats Jessica! You made it!",False
24,8,Great documentary painting the real Indonesia,portillamail,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doco will be an eye opener about the flaws of the Indonesian legal system as well as the increasing superficiality of the society, inspired by their wealthier neighbours. Indonesia is a place you don't want to be if you get in legal troubles. They have no issue giving people the death penalty for minuscules issues, like a bit of drugs or blasphemy. Thanks to the director and producers. Some people give the doco a low score because they don't like how the case is presented but the doco in itself is great and accurate. Now I'll repeat it:

25,4,The Indonesian Legal System,lisa-silvestri,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn my opinion, whether Jessica is guilty or not, how could they truly know? Their legal system is so unfair and just plain strange!In court, the accused is able to pass notes to a journalist, complementing her on her wardrobe.Facial analysts brought in as expert witnesses, seriously?The murder weapon was supposed to be cyanide, they never touched on that subject. Where would Jessica have obtained cyanide?This documentary is interesting, but not really about the case, more about the justice system. I should say, the lack of a justice system.How can anybody get a fair trial? I'll never go to Indonesia, that's for sure.",True

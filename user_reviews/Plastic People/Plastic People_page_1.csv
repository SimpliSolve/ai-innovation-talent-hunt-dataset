1,7,Scary Yet Informative,Yohghurt,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's quite disturbing.. We are no longer homo sapiens but we are now homo plasticus.. its shocking to know how plastics will affect us in the long run.Even if we ignore or avoid plastic its already late, we've been contaminated for years from the land, ocean and unfortunately within the air.This documentary proves that knowledge is power and awareness is our shield yet we are so powerless.. its already in our body and we cannot do anything about it.Informative documentary but it couldve been more convincing for viewers yet I wish it will reach out to every people children to adult. We must be aware.",False

1,8,Him is him,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you know Bayern Munich, you will have heard of the Mia san Mia (which translated means We are We) ... so it's a riff on that .. and as always with me: no pun intended. Now I am biased to say the least - as a fan and supporter of the club. So while Thomas M. Transcends the club and has people liking him that hate the club he will be forever be associated with ...

And that there is more to the man, to the mystery ... I reckon some things we can't completely grasp ... also: there is the ""finale dahoam"" this season ... Champions League final is set to be played in Munich ... now that would be a perfect ending ... even if it is not in here ...",False

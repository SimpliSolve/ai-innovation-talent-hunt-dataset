1,7,Glomar Explorer doc,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a documentary about Glomar Explorer. The years are late 60's to mid-70's. The CIA wanted to raise a sunken Soviet submarine in the Pacific. They recruited Howard Hughes to be their cover story. Meanwhile, the world was obsessed with Watergate.I already know about the Glomar Explorer. In fact, I knew it first as the CIA's intended cover story with Howard Hughes doing undersea mining in an educational short. I did not know about the CIA covert operation until much later. This documentary weaves that story into the overall political situation. I never considered it, but that's an interesting aspect of the story. It's a bit scattered at times. Seymour Hersh is heavily featured in the investigating. Nowadays, he's turned into anti-American opinion maker. One can certainly see that started in the CIA-Nixon dirty tricks era. In fact, this doc almost makes the CIA look good while dirtying some of the reporters. Maybe this is a CIA plant.",False

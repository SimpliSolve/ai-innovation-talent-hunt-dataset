1,8,Enlightening,osvaldoantunes,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very good, brings a wider view of what happened, how it happened and why it happened. Also it names and shame some people and organisations involved, much needed to bring accountability on such a tragic event and fall out of the idea that it was just a crazy act performed by a lunatic and that it couldn't have been avoid. Every mass shooting in the US could have been avoided. This one has some sad particularities that drove me get to know more about it, and this movie so far was the best study presented.May all the victims rest in peace.",False
2,7,Good info- poor presentation,tsteffen-04476,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary was actually very informative and I came away with a wealth of information that I had no clue about before. However, it is very hard to follow and doesn't do a good job of transitioning from each topic. Feels very scattered and rushed.",False
3,8,Interesting programme,grahamhamilton,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gun control in the US is a joke, yes anyone can get a gun and they can also massacre innocent people.It's a vicious circle, the answer, buy bigger guns, how stupid are people.",False
4,n/a,"Background music 70%, voices 30%",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,The nonstop background music was a headache inducing distraction while straining to hear the interviews of the people. Never have I had such a hard time watching anything due to sound choices.,False
5,7,Lie Vegas,unknownduck,n/a,15/08/2025,"Clearly Las Vegas is the most corrupt city in the USA, which is the most corrupt country in the world. I hope people stay away from both after watching this and boycott MGM everywhere. RIP to the 58 victims.",False
6,7,"horrific happening, shallow docu...",ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"Because there are room for a deepploughing 10 episode crime tv-.series of doumentary stuff in here. but one thing for sure, yet another example it is, how voulnerable you are in open spaces in the usa (or britain or even norway if at a political summer camp). give the victims a real comprehensive amount of damage compensation payment, and do the lock out on the vouchers that has let this aftermath become as it has.productionwise its touching many aspects of the happening, but it could have gone deeper on the individual vouchers in clark county , city of las vegas, and the state of nevada. the grumpy old man recommends a look, and my advice is...always plan an emergency route out of the venue when attending large crowds or concerts, it will happen again im afraid",False
7,10,Powerful and Disturbing,Disney135,n/a,15/08/2025,I have been researching the horrific and deadly attack in Las Vegas since right after it happened and I have watched several documentaries (all of them were obviously hard to watch) but none were as powerful and disturbing as this one. To see the faces of some of the surviving victims who were interviewed was hard to watch (I cannot imagine what these people experienced) as they spoke about their involvement in this attack (I will forever refer to it as terrorism because those people were clearly terrorized even if it was not officially a terrorist attack) and their outrage at the resort company suing them (something that was not ever done before after something like this). The brief part with the attacker's brother was interesting when he spoke about their lives and how their father was a known criminal . I'm not a major conspiracy theorist but I think they covered up what happened with Stephen Paddock. My continued sympathy lies with the families of the fallen and the surviving victims whose lives were destroyed in such a horrific and unreasonable manner.,False
8,9,Will never visit Las Vegas having seen this.,nigelmacdonald-97173,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'd always wanted to visit Vegas until this mass shooting. Of course I knew the mob history and heard about the sleazy side, but after watching this it seems the corporations and MGM in particular are as bad, if not worse than the mob. There was no excuse for what the shooter did, but if you wanted to try and provoke someone to take his course of action, they went exactly the right way about it and the cover up afterwards should be a national disgrace. Even Ellen Degeneris has blood on her hands, but that should be no big surprise.",False
9,10,The House ALWAYS wins!,frankiepozos,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIncredible documentary! This filim is on the money. Ramsey Denison provides an intelligent thesis for the how and why of the worst mass shooting and the corporate coverup that shrouds the simple truth. Denison does the worlk LVMPD and MGM deliberately failed to do. The victim accounts are harrowing. High roller Stephen Paddock and all those souls who went to see Jason Aldean- lost to the house. Spoilers- reneged comps, cops ordered to turn off body cams, changing timelines, Ellen DeGeneres slot machines etc., they all fit into the horror. I love Vegas but this doc makes you miss the halcyon Mob days. enjoy, Patti",True

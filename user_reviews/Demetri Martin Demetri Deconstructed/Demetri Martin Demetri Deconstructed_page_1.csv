1,7,A funny and mostly successful special.,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've liked Demetri Martin's standup in the past, and while this one wasn't quite as strong as I remember those past specials being, I did enjoy it quite a bit. He has a way of making mild anxiety about strange but relatable things very funny, and it was consistent enough here to make the odd joke not hitting forgivable. The rate feels pretty good throughout, enough for me to say I found it funnier than a good 2/3s of the specials I've gotten through on Netflix. Not top-tier, but still one of the better ones.The framing device largely works. I wasn't crazy about it entirely (some editing feels a little strange) and it's a way to kind of fall back on certain parts not working by framing it all as a simulation. I don't think it's an airtight way of addressing an imperfect routine, but there is some novelty to be had from the way the whole thing's set up and presented. Points for trying to do something different, I guess.",False
2,6,Ditch the weird editing,smc7777777,n/a,16/08/2025,"The editing was very strange and distracting from an otherwise decent special. I dont know why they thought it was a good idea, as it completely kills the momentum of each bit and is distracting every time they do a weird cut or add some flair or whatever it is they are trying to do.Demetris jokes are good enough by themselves so you dont need to do any of that. With his style you just need to pay attention and theres always a good payoff, but its hard when the editing is so distracting and serves basically no purpose aside from looking quirky.They should re release this special without the weird editing. It will be easier to follow.. the jokes dont need additional help.",False

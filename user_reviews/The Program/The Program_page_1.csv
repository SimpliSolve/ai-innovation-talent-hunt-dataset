1,8,A great introduction to modern UAP-ology,John_Human,n/a,16/08/2025,"This IS the most up to date documentary on the phenomena. The pacing and the editing left a lot of room to digest the revelatory substance. There is no doubt, something is going on.The first 2/3's of this documentary are some of the most important points to understand about modern phenomena. The normal person who doesn't know much or anything about the topic will face undeniable facts, from reputable sources. It was a perfect way to show anyone, that this topic is something to take seriously.However, I am left with questions and potential motives about some of the witnesses/interviews, feeling very skeptical about one in particular.Overall, it is a fantastic documentary. One that I would share with my friends (and some of my fam).",False
2,6,Same old stuff,Mikesf-243-760546,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary seems like a dime a dozen. It's the same old stuff that we've been hearing for years now. This is just another film regurgitating what we've already seen on YouTube, the news, etc. I have a lot of respect for James Fox, but not worth the money for the rental. Tell us something we don't know and then this would be a better review. It gives you a little more insight in how the government has gone out of their way to hide certain aspects of this case, but nothing that would surprise you. I don't understand why these whistleblowers don't just take a chance and tell us something of value. I'm tired of hearing, I can't talk about it. Oh wow, you don't say...",False
3,8,Great summary for those interested in the topic,plaptas,n/a,16/08/2025,"James Fox delivered a really good overview and summary on what's been going on in the government for the past few years in regards to the UFO/UAP topic. Don't be fooled, if this was a show presenting you a proof that this topic is real and we have alien invasion on the way, you would hear it in all news stations. What The Program does well is at least showing you that the topic of UFOs shouldn't be dismissed or ridiculed as there are many government, intelligence and military officials and who have been involved in it for years. What would be great is to make it more a documentary and less drama music and the deep voice of the narrator which is a bit childish for me. Anyway, best one I've seen so far. Well done James!",False
4,10,James Fox never disappoints,robmiller1985,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you follow the topic it's nothing new, but still interesting. It's documentaries like these that will captivate casual believers and keep them up to date with what's been happening. The fact that congress and the media are finally taking this seriously is something I never thought I would see in my lifetime. I don't usually leave reviews but we can't let this get buried by the disinformation campaigns and ""skeptics"". Supporting people like James Fox is crucial to disclosure. At this point you're either willfully ignorant or a part of the problem, it's time to get on the right side of history.",False
5,6,Falls short of Fox's prior work,knifemagnet,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Program has an interesting start as it seems to attempt to shine a light on a reported, and beyond government oversight, crash retrieval program that has been in existence for some eighty years. As hyped as I was going into this film I was ultimately disappointed - it simply provides cliff notes to information gleaned from public Congressional hearings and tidbits from witnesses: if you have been following all of this on your own there is little to be had here. Some witnesses are included despite them saying nothing, and that paints a telling picture of just how muddy this entire endeavor is, despite people believing we are on the path to disclosure. Yes, that's right, in the year 2025 it says more to say nothing - ""I can't comment about that"" effectively is a comment 'about that'. Quite sad. For me this tends to go off the rails a bit when it begins diverting off the trajectory of 'the program' and, once more, into witness scenarios - the sort you see on every other UFO/UAP/ET documentary or cable series.Then you have the issue of witness integrity... And I sure do not envy James Fox for attempting to vet these people. One of his witnesses began to tell a slightly different story - that goes on to a very sensational arc - on a podcast: this part of this witness' story was not told in this film. This was so bad that, during yet another podcast with this 'witness', Fox threatened to leave if the witness was going to entertain discussing that story... That part of the witness' story by the way, despite spending time with James Fox and being interviewed etc, was never told to James. What's more, this same witness includes a massive detail in his story in this film that was left out in a podcast interview - which makes little sense (if you see a craft why is it left out here and there?). What that says to me is that this specific witness it not as credible as he may seem. Was this witness lying outright? I doubt it. But it is rather odd and a red flag. For some that might equate to Fox taking a hit in the credibility department... I do not hold him responsible. I do believe Fox is trying to inform and build momentum towards disclosure and, as a non-omnipotent human, he can only do so much in validating a witness. Some problematic people may slip through the cracks. I will not comment on this witness more than you can look for yourself on YouTube by looking at, perhaps, Julian Dorey's podcast.So all in all, this is a very mixed bag. The Phenomenon and Moment of Contact both tower over this. As someone that has been into this subject since I was a kid I do look forward to more from James.",False
6,10,He's nailed it again!,emms75,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been waiting for this release for so long, finally watched it this evening. James is determined to get to the truth, and he delivers his research in such a brilliant, compelling way.Absolutely highly recommend this movie, and indeed any of James' others, whether you're new to this idea or not.He finds the most credible witnesses and mindblowing cases - I'm gripped from beginning to end.Like most, I was once highly skeptical that extra terrestrial visited Earth, but I feel we are on a journey here, helped along by the likes of James Fox who is committed to raising awareness of what will be the most important revelation to mankind.",False
7,7,Love James Fox but....,gdhxtjvgh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love a good documentary and my favorite topic is anything related to UAP's. I think this particular subject comes under a high level of scrutiny because of the decades of controversy, cover-up, and sensationalism. There is so much truth to the UAP phenomenon and I believe James Fox is outstanding in his investigation and content put fourth in this documentary. However, what I think is unnecessary, and reduces its credence, is the constant soundtrack music. Especially during interviews. It is not only distracting, but overly sensationalizes the topic. I actually enjoyed ""Moment of Contact"" much more from James Fox.",False
8,10,Disclosure by proxy,ktdavidkd,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm going to keep this simple...we ARE NOT ALONE, WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ALONE! Those of a belief in God know that He is the creator of multiple universes, and uncalculable varieties of life forms and varying intelligences throughout the cosmos. Why? Because He's God. It is uninformed, uninspired, self-centered and egoistic thinking that bouys a belief that we are the best God could do. We are zygotes, a blink of the eye to the negative quadrillionth power in the universal timeline thus far. How do you profess the belief that God is who He says He is, ""I am that I am"", yet limit Him on the possibility of Him having created different life forms more advanced than us? ""They"" are just another representation of His omnipotence; a different form of life that He has ALSO bequeathed with free will. And just like us, because of the free will He gives us ALL, some do right, and others commit evil.",False
9,7,As Documentaries go,JoyceB-73,n/a,16/08/2025,"As documentaries go, this has all the requirements. Many different views and people and opinions and facts of course. The fact the American people have to make a documentary in order to get information out to the public is always the thing that makes me shake my head.Who on earth ever said that our government was aloud to make these types of decisions for the people. I have never seen a statement in any document reading like this ""The President, Congress, or any other area of American government has the sole right to decide which i formation ""we the people"" are aloud to have or are having the choice made to hide the truth from the American people"" just because they think we are not intelligent enough or reasonably capable to accept &/or comprehend information deemed from out of this world or foreign to an average individual ""American"", being the key word Nowhere is it written that the American government is not
only aloud to hide information, but also only the government has the capacity and intellegence & understanding of whatever it is to be able to make the decision on what to share and what to hide and make the decision to do so. We pay the government salaries. We are the governments bosses and they should at the very least make a find of any kind from another world a top priority to share with the people. Like everything the government hides from the people, it is always about money! Take money or money from invention or technology out of the equation, what other motivation is there? We may get frightened by what we see or know? Did the government have that experience? Then why can we the people not be trusted by our own ""elected"" government. The truth is, elected or not, we ca never trust our government to be honest with us if they are also in total control of the money!Our American society should have learned many many years ago to take the money responsibilities away from the government, meaning they have no say on how any funds are distributed to anyone. An entirely seperate elected and 100% documentarion open to the public, group be handling the money. Any government. Office that needs funds must apply and have specific requirements met to get their funds allocated.Until the money gets taken away from the government rule we will never have a translucent and honest government running ""our"" country! Personal statements and views and opinions are mine and do not reflect this site. It just needs to be said.And in the end of the documentary we still have no answers and no truth revealed as it will always be with this government. Thank you!",False
10,5,"Out of respect for James Fox's prior documentaries and efforts, I'll rate this a 5/10 review.",StonehengeDSB,n/a,16/08/2025,"Of all the documentary filmmakers who've delved into the UFO/UAP phenomenon in the past 30 years, James Fox has put out some of the best work on this subject:. Films such as I Know What I Saw, Out of the Blue, The phenomenon, Moment of Contact, have all been stellar imo. I purchased this latest one, on day one of its release, filled with eager anticipation. Having watched it I must say this is a massive disappointment. Caveat, perhaps for the uninitiated, they may find some intrigue in the recent legislation and the drama surrounding it, culminating ultimately the unfortunate dismantling of the disclosure bill. But for those of us who have been following this issue for quite some time, there is nothing new in this documentary. I guess you could say I'm kind of shocked at the lack of anything revelatory. While The Program is factually accurate unlike a Dr. Steven Greer documentary, it's nonetheless still full of fluff. This is unfortunately, perhaps the inevitable byproduct of what happens when news casters, film makers, etc. Put all their eggs in the UFO money making basket, as ufologists or disclosure advocates, they run out of anything new to say on the subject matter.",False
11,10,James Fox never disappoints,rossettoart,n/a,16/08/2025,Honestly I love everything James Fox's makes so my opinion may be one sided. Been waiting years for this and it was honestly worth the wait. If you're a newcomer to the whole ufo/uap world the movie I start with for everyone is James Fox's Phenomenon . It's great for learning everything that you need to know to get started basically were this concentrates more on the government secret side of things the phenomenon covers the worldwide cases that bring legitimacy to the topic case by case. This one truly tells about the government reverse engineering programs and other things they've been hiding definitely worth the watch.,False
12,4,Nothing new.,qywedxu,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you're an avid follower of the ""Disclosure"" issue, even an average dabbler, you'll find that you most likely have seen most of this material. I'm glad I didn't pay full asking price to see this doc. This segment covers the ""program"" or the reasons why the government has been hiding this information from the people. It is frustrating to say the least. Especially, what Hal Puthoff says to justify his silence and the reasons he seems to support is justified reasons to hide disclosure. We all know the phenomenon is real and it's being hidden by personal (both private and government) who operate within their own government within a government. That in and of itself is a crime, or it darn should be!You'll get some decent UAP footage but again, you've probably have seen it. I don't think the movie or documentary reveals anything new and definitely not ground shaking. I would wait until it's released for viewing for free.",True
13,10,James Fox as you'd expect.,samuellanyon,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary gets the right balance in terms of delivering for those of us long termers interested in the topic of UAPs and disclosure along with those of us that are new to the topic. I always appreciate the structure associated with James's documentaries. He introduces us to themes and details in a way that makes cuts through the noise and makes you understand what's relevant. The segment involving Craig Lindsey and the background behind the Calvine photo was particularly impactful. Honestly, given the number of individual whistleblowers (mostly retired) who have come out in the documentary to describe their first hand accounts is so impressive. Career military and intelligence personnel who are entirely cogent and willing to put their legacy on the line is the thing that does it for me. I am not one for conspiracy theories but the sheer volume of case studies, whistleblowers and dismissiveness from the likely ""people in the know"" is what makes me think that sometimes, you need to question what you are being told by the people in power. Please keep doing what your doing Mr Fox.",False
14,10,A must see!,justintime-22235,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether you're new to ufology or a longtime researcher this new riveting documentary from the legendary director James Fox will keep you glued to your seats! This is by far one of the best documentaries on the topic and a must see! The storytelling is superbly written for anyone new to disclosure or the veteran researcher alike. My partner and I have been eagerly awaiting the release of The Program for almost a year and a half and it did not disappoint! Thank you James Fox and the rest of the team for bringing this masterpiece to the masses and for continuing the fight for government transparency on this most important issue. Allie & Justin with the UAPSociety. Much Love, Peace and Namaste.",False
15,9,Love all of James Fox's work,JoeyCeee,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great interviews, great camera work, great narration.JF's documentaries raise questions, give answers, no wild speculation.

I definitely want to believe, nothing wrong with that as far as I see.I look forward for more documentaries like this, and the truth.",False
16,3,The Program that we still know nothing about,Bethea1985,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPhysicist Harold Puthoff will be taking these ""alleged secrets"" to the grave. The man, born in 1936, is 88 years old! He states he is scared of jail time if he were to break his agreements and disclose what he knows. The UAP hearings, The NASA disclosure (nothing sandwich), this all has not provided any hard evidence outside of what has already been released. With the legislation passed by congress protecting whistleblowers, still nothing has come to light.Mr. Fox has indeed made and intriguing documentary for the person that knows nothing on this subject. It's a retelling of things the public should have known for years since the Pentagons release of info on UAPs after the New York Times story. Good narrator for the film. Well paced. Well shot. The info that was put out was coherently presented for a novice. I just wish there was something new worth the price of the rental fee I paid.",True
17,9,Quality once again,jedpb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Firstly, if you're taking this documentary in with the anticipation of disclosure come the credits - seriously, what are you doing? If there had been disclosure about intelligent life not from Earth you'd have already heard about it.This documentary serves as an as-good-if-not-better instalment following on from Fox's previous release ""The Phenomenon"". Regardless if you're a keen and up to date enthusiast of the subject, it's a great piece that brings some smaller details to the table, little bits of info or an intriguing sentence here and there that you wouldn't have heard or read about otherwise.For those new to the world of UAP's / UFO's / NHI etc. Kick back and enjoy, because we're in a wild time when it comes to something that was ubiquitously ridiculed until recently.",False
18,2,Dramatic creepy music and a lot of build-up but nothing happens.,pecksrinne,n/a,16/08/2025,"Once again I wasted time on one of these ufo shows.. Always the same thing, dramatic creepy music with creepy soundeffects and a lot of build-up but nothing happens.I know just as much as I did before watching this. Are the governments hiding ufos? Sure looks like it.Are we going to find out someday? I hope so.Are we getting any closer to the government opening up their files or something? Does not look like it but thankfully there is a whistleblower who will tell us under oath of what he saw, not in this movie but maybe in the next, lol.So sometime in the future we will maybe hear about it. In the next movie maybe, where they will tell us the same story again with dramatic music.I´m so stupid for even watching this crap.",False

20,5,Peter Coyote still lives,Bernie4444,n/a,16/08/2025,"The only thing of value in the hodgepodge of alien gobbledygook is that we know at the time of its making, Peter Coyote is still alive. Yes, Peter Coyote is a good actor in many well-known movies. However, he is better recognized for over 242 presentations in which he served as the narrator. He knows how to maintain a straight face and a calm voice. Without him, this program would fade into just another UFO narrative in a sea of narratives.Aside from that, this is merely another rehash of old clips discussed in a sound bite format. They added footage of up-to-date (2024) conversations that will eventually become old hat in the next documentary.If you are interested in this sort of thing, then you will want to watch ""Hagar 1: The UFO Files"" (2014-2015). The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON).",False
21,1,do not waste your time!,abdulk-94496,n/a,16/08/2025,"This director of this film is as fraudulent as Graham Hancock and Jeremy Corbell. Don't waste your time watching this, most of the stuff discussed is things we all knew already. On his appreance on JRE, all he kept saying was ""he cleaned up the audio"" of videos that are already all over the internet. If you want to waste your time watching a whole documentary for a few minutes of ""cleaner audio"" then do at your own risk. I feel these type of documentaries would have done better in the 80s/90s where the internet wasn't around. Information is updated so fast nowadays that there is no real purpose of watching these since they are just stuff that are repeated again, it would have been cool if he had some exclusive stuff that was never seen before.

22,1,Fluff Piece,zymxxsc,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSave your $20. If you want to see modern disclosure look up UAP HEARING ON CSPAN on YouTube. For the casual or uninitiated, be prepared to be absolutely floored. Unlike this documentary which took 20 seconds of the least interesting portion of the aforementioned video and then added an 1hr 41min of dramatic music, James Foxs face, and interviews with every average Joe he could find - rather than the highly vetted/verified/senior government officials who testified in the aforementioned video.Also $20 is an immaculately steep price. I cannot possibly fathom what production value this documentary could have in any feasible way required that price tag.I can go see a brand new movie in theater with a bag of popcorn for $20, hell they'll even butter me up for free.

23,1,Dont waste your time... watch something else.,cerivs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unless you want a lesson in ""gaslighting,"" or a summary of what has already been exposed, this is a ""politically leaning"" production showing you nothing ""new"" while making it sound like something is being revealed, while at the same time, revealing nothing.If that was the producer, director, and interviewers goal, they achieved it.Even the govt's efforts to ""reveal or even confirm"" anything about this topic, is spun as we're trying but not even scratching the surface.Watch some with Greer instead.This film just reinforces the idea that if you ask, and find anything, you are subject to being prosecuted to the fullest extent of the US's laws as a Natl security risk.Hence, there is no ""transparency"" so you might as well avoid this topic as you're either a ""traitor"" or a looney aka ""conspiracy theorist.""",False
24,1,This is 2024's version of Blaxploitation,Identity_T,n/a,16/08/2025,"James Fox's decision to platform Jason Sands reflects a modern form of exploitation that trades on mental instability and unverified claims for entertainment and profit. Much like Blaxploitation in the 1970s, which commodified racial stereotypes to attract audiences, this new wave of exploitation relies on individuals whose credibility is questionable and whose stories are sensational enough to capture public attention. Instead of race, the focus here is on exploiting vulnerability-whether through psychological instability, delusion, or outright dishonesty-and repackaging it as evidence to fuel a growing appetite for conspiracy narratives.Sands' claims of participating in a ""secret space program"" and being ordered to kill extraterrestrials are not grounded in any verifiable reality. His Air Force service record reflects a conventional, honorable career in Signals Intelligence and aircraft maintenance. There is no evidence of involvement in space operations, advanced aerospace technologies, or clandestine programs. Yet Fox has chosen to amplify Sands' narrative, prioritizing spectacle over substance.This decision is not about uncovering the truth; it is about capitalizing on an individual's instability or fabrications to satisfy public curiosity. By giving Sands a platform, Fox compromises the integrity of serious UAP inquiry. In recent years, credible investigations and testimonies from scientists, government agencies, and vetted whistleblowers have brought the subject of UAPs into mainstream discourse. Platforming individuals like Sands-whose stories are riddled with extraordinary and unsubstantiated claims-cheapens that progress. It reduces legitimate research to spectacle and reinforces the stereotype that the UAP field is a breeding ground for fringe ideas and unreliable sources.Just as Blaxploitation films often overshadowed authentic depictions of Black life, Fox's work overshadows credible efforts to understand UAP phenomena by muddying the waters with sensationalism.Fox's actions reflect a failure in ethical storytelling. As a filmmaker, he bears responsibility for vetting his subjects and presenting narratives that hold up to scrutiny. Instead, he exploits Sands' claims without regard for their truth, turning a person's likely psychological or personal struggles into entertainment. Whether Sands is driven by delusion, dishonesty, or a need for attention, Fox's platforming of him transforms those struggles into a commodity. This is not storytelling; it is exploitation.The cost of such exploitation is significant. For individuals like Sands, it places their instability or dishonesty on public display, inviting scrutiny and ridicule while providing no real support or accountability. For the broader conversation around UAPs, it undermines trust and credibility, dragging legitimate inquiry back into the realm of sideshow entertainment. Fox is not advancing understanding or contributing to the truth; he is creating a spectacle that serves no one but himself and his audience's appetite for shock value.The parallels to Blaxploitation are clear. In both cases, the subjects are reduced to tools for profit, stripped of dignity, truth, or context. What Fox has done with Sands is no different. It is a modern exploitation of instability and deception, repackaged for a public willing to suspend reality for the sake of entertainment. Such practices do not serve the pursuit of knowledge; they only serve those who profit from confusion.",False

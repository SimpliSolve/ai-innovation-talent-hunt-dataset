1,8,Amazing plot twist,gwenolds,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first half of the movie was boiler-plate Christian documentary, but then they told you the rest of the story. Impossible not to see God's hand in it. I was blown away. Certainly anyone that has had father issues; good, bad, or MIA... will get something worthwhile out of it.",False
2,7,Inspiring documentary on the importance of the role of fathers,Wuchakk,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Show Me the Father"" (2021) is an inspirational documentary that focuses on why fathers or father figures are strategic in one's life. While it was directed by 'no-name' Rick Altizer, it was produced by the Kendrick brothers, Alex and Stephen, known for inspiring dramas like ""War Room"" (2015) and ""Fireproof"" (2008).There are naturally a few motivational speakers or preachers, such as the genuine Tony Evans. The story covering Deland McCullough and his mentor Sherman Smith is particularly noteworthy; not so much at first maybe, but stick around for the last act and there's a serious 'wow' factor.Speaking of the climax, it's driven home how many people, especially men, are walking around like the living dead, hampered by an invisible curse that weighs them down. The flick effectively informs about receiving the blessing of the heavenly Father and moving forward with faith, hope and love.Like me, it'll probably prompt you to look back at your life and connect the pieces, answering questions, not to mention reignite the fire of motivation.The film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes.GRADE: B.",False
3,10,It's about time the real Superheroes in a movie were DADS!,pastorsteve-92314,n/a,15/08/2025,"You can see the latest sci-fi or action movie...and leave with an adrenaline rush. But when was the last time it had a lasting effect?? Everyone loves a great movie...especially a movie with a twist. Wow...all I can say is POW-WOW-ERFUL MOVIE!!! A must see. You will NOT regret seeing this movie. I promise you it's not some hokey sub-quality Jesus-flick. The message of what Fatherhood is at every stage in every way good and bad...absent or present. I will first say ALL MEN SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE. Dads...you have kids, especially sons...this is a movie you need to see. Wives...give your husbands a night out with this movie. All couples should see this movie. Okay...everyone who has had a dad (all of us) need to see this movie. Saw this tonight with my wife Caroline and a bunch of friends...and wow...a bunch of us stayed in the theater room after to talk about it and pray for our families.",False
4,10,Mind-blowing stories,drugrxman,n/a,15/08/2025,What an awesome film. This movie appeals to everyone who needs the love of a perfect father. The Kendrick brothers have blessed us once again with a heart-felt film which brings so much glory to God the Father.,False
5,10,"I laughed, I cried, I was shocked! Great heart-warming stories!",jeanbcreede,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thought that this movie was exactly what I needed to see today. It touches your heart no matter what your situation is. I am no critic, but the photography, music, acting, and interviews were top-notch. I was interested during the entire movie and left wanting to be told just one more story. Some of the stories had surprising endings. This is definitely the type of movie that America needs to see.",False
6,9,Great Message - Even For The Non-Religious,joe6629,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some very inspiring stories and a pretty amazing twist toward the end.You can take what you want from this film and even though I'm not religious, I think the message is crucial: Fathers are incredibly important for us as individuals and as a society. With the relentless Leftist attacks on the family - and especially Fathers - it's awesome to see a well-made, Life-affirming film for a change.",False
7,10,This Documentary Spoke To Me.,filmbuff-05706,n/a,15/08/2025,"Show Me To The Father is the 7th film from the Kendrick Brothers, and their first documentary. It is also their best movie yet. This movie makes me hope that they make more documentaries.The documentary is focused on a handful of men, including Alex and Stephen- The Kendrick Brothers themselves, some football stars, and more, and their stories about how their Earthly fathers have pointed them to their Heavenly Father.What makes SMTF so powerful is that they are true stories. Their previous stories have God working in unusual ways- such as making infertile women have quite a few kids. This movie is different, they are real testimonies of Christian men whose fathers raised them or led them to honor and follow Jesus.From a filmmaking standpoint, this is easily the best made film by the Kendrick Brothers. Albeit bright at times, the cinematography is glorious, the camera placed well- simply put, it looked like a regular movie and not a low budget one.However, SMTF works best emotionally. It did an amazing job pulling my heartstrings and even making me teary. One story is from Jim Daly, founder of Focus on the Family.Jim came from an abusive home, and also had many foster families, none of whom actually adopted him. He tells the story of how he looked to his Heavenly Father for the love he seeked, rather than looking to man.This is where the movie hit me personally. I am a child abuse survivor, which occurred from my stepfather, just 5 years after the death of my biological father. Jim's story doesn't exactly match mine (my abuse was more emotional than physical), but we had similar low points and we both had to look to faith for healing.Football star Deland McCullough also tells his story- how he was adopted and never knew who his real father was, and how he looked to his childhood coach for fatherly guidance. This story (told in parts) has an amazing plot twist that could be ranked up with The 6th Sense or Fight Club- even the 3 women behind me gasped at the plot twist- and again, this is a real-life story!Among the other stories, we hear from Alex and Stephen themselves, about how their father Larry has helped them grow, and how that has affected their fatherhood, filmmaking, and even their marriages. This includes yet another plot twist in the story of how Stephen adopted a girl from China.With awful Christian movies like God's Not Dead, Unplanned, Loving The Bad Man, A Matter of Faith, and other poorly made movies being produced, it is wonderful to see a film like Show Me The Father released. It touched me and even made me tear up, and I don't even have kids yet. Even non-religious viewers could be moved by how these Christians have found hope through their faith.Even if you are not a Christian, if you want a powerful, moving film, there are few that I could suggest more than this one. I owe my deepest gratitude to the Kendrick Brothers for this fantastic movie. This simple Christian movie has what the best movies of any genre does- HEART.",False
8,10,A much needed film!,jeanneb-47632,n/a,15/08/2025,"Loved this film. A series of beautiful life stories, where lives were completely transformed by our Heavenly Father. No matter who or what your earthly father is/was, the Heavenly Father loves you more than you can imagine. Please have the courage to watch this film in its entirety. You won't regret it!",False
9,10,Amazing testimonies of Love!,critilin,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is a beautiful movie that touches your heart. I agree with other reviews that all MEN should see this movie and all young people should see it. If you have a lot of questions about your identity, about God's love, or even about your parents ... you should see this movie. God will speak to your heart!",True
10,10,Wow. Great stories,cbethanie,n/a,15/08/2025,"The role of a father is so important. Grace. Redemption. Amazing stories, powerful blessings.",False
11,9,Wonderful Movie and a much needed message,mhuneycu,n/a,15/08/2025,This is a wonderful movie and a much needed message. Pay close attention to the statistics about sons and daughters who grow up without a father. Every Father should watch this movie and see the impact they can have if they simply recognize the love of God the Father and then reflect that love onto their family.,False
12,10,"Great movie, finally a true story that shakes your heart",taliagarciay,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is based on true stories, I learnt so much and enjoy it feom beginning to end. It touches your heart so deeply ahd gives you tears of joy of true and hope. Having a good feeling the movie.",False
13,9,Poignant,crazi-swans,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe inspiring new documentary from the Kendrick Brothers about the power of a father.A collection of true stories about growing up with or without a father, and how that changed them as they in turn became fathers, and how they view their Heavenly Father. Heartfelt and honest, with a variety of different perspectives and insights, featuring Tony Evans, Jim Daly, Stephen Kendrick and more!Engaging and well edited, the interviews are well placed, and I enjoyed hearing each of the heartfelt stories of triumph and heartache. I'm not typically the documentary type, but this was as engaging as a screenplay, and I can see why this movie was close to their hearts. Definitely, an inspirational film to share with the family, that points to the only perfect Father.Many thanks to Sony Pictures for providing this product/product information for review. Opinions are 100% my own and NOT influenced by monetary compensation. I did receive a sample of the product in exchange for this review and post.",True
14,10,"Emotional, educational, heartwarming and hopeful!",khbutler2004,n/a,15/08/2025,"This doc was the best I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of documentaries about a lot of different stuff!The perspectives from the men on this show were foreign to me because I'm a woman, but I learned so much from these Godly men.Throughout this documentary I thought of my imperfect father who I loved so much and who tried his hardest. He was a very good dad and I wish he was still here on earth.My advice is to watch this! Watch this! Watch this, and keep your heart open, because when the story is over, your heart will be full! You'll see your father, grandfathers, brothers, uncles and mentors in a whole different (and hopefully respectful) way.",False

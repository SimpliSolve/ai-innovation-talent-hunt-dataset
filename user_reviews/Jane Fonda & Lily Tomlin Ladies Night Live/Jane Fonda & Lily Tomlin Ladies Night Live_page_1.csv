1,5,Some funny moments,kristinrutkowski,n/a,16/08/2025,Too many of these comedians hung up on pandemic jokes. It's getting old- try something different. The ones who went in a different direction were actually funny .,False
2,3,netflix failed project,activesilver,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched a view of these shows (bill burr, amy shumer and now Jane and Lily) and they just don't work somehow.Not even Iliza could save this one, the idea of these shows is nice, but sadly it failed.",False
3,4,A few funny segments,Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,"A few of the guest comedians put on a really good show, Tracey Ashley and Iliza Shlesinger killed it. However a few segments weren't funny and all were stuck on the pandemic. Unfortunately all the segments with Jane and Lily were unfunny and bland, which was surprising.",False
4,2,"Ugh, I hate to be the one to say it...",bbbalson,n/a,16/08/2025,This is unfunny from the overly scripted Lilly and Jane bits to the female comedians. Even the ones that are funny cant save that poopshow that this is.,False
5,10,It gets better and better! This reivews seems to be just hate,avatarguille,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started watching it, and it starts a but slow. But it's gets better while keeps going.Amazing to see so many woman in the stage being open and funny and lovely.Thank you !! <3.",False
6,3,"Sorry, but this flopped for me",jobaybe,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely LOVE stand up comedy, but this show was not very good at all. Some of the gals made me slightly giggle at times, but I was getting bored by the political and pandemic jokes. Enough already. Jane and Lily, I'm sorry to say were just plain awful from the get-go. It was all so scripted and awkward and I felt kind of bad and embarrassed for them. They were almost unwatchable. Sorry ladies.",False
7,1,Hard to watch,juliedupont-70287,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a fan of stand-up comedy as well as Grace and Frankie, I had high hopes for this special. Unfortunately it's so bad, I actually found it painful to watch. I don't think I laughed even once through the whole thing. The bits featuring Jane and Lily are simply awful : poorly written jokes with a very awkward delivery. As for the comedians' sets, they are repetitive and often amount to woke virtue signaling instead of actual comedy.",False
8,3,Bored with the topics,sredick-56362,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lily & Jane were overly praised, yet minimally entertaining. The comics forget that not everyone watching is from Los Angeles or NY... Nor a liberal. I'm a middle of the road Texan woman. I just want to laugh and not think about the pandemic or ""being woke"". Surely women can still talk and make jokes about a new subject. This offended me more than it entertained. Iliza... Love her but would rather not learn who she voted for during a ""comedy show"".",False
9,4,"sorry to say, but...",isaacmizrahii,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm old. And as far as 'women's rights' goes, nothing else ever made sense to me, considering that women, if the man was out with the job(which got less and less true over my seventy year span), then the woman was doing most of the parenting. This was obvious to me from the time i was a teener, and i respected their roles and contributions...
AND...i consider myself 'woke' and don't like that some people might criticize this way of being/thinking/acting. But who likes having it, or anything else, shoved down their throat?And aSIDE from any of the above, AND that i've enjoyed Jane and Lily's work for a half a century, i found this comedy special to be cringeworthy... disappointingly bad. Tired and unfunny.I can understand how Netflix might have thought it would be a good idea... something that would appeal to the 'woke' crowd(myself included) but didn't they watch it after it was done?I'm sorry to say that i did...
i WAS going to give it five stars, but then i read some of the biased 9s and 10s and did the opposite of what i usually do, when a movie has been underrated and deserved a (much) better rating and DOWNrated it a star.I believe in fairness, after all...and to say that this special was any better than mediocre would be overly generous. No matter HOW much i like the hosts.",False
10,10,Representation Matters!,DAPVH,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a Mexican-American college-educated Latina, it was a magical feeling to see other Latinxs killing the stage. Honestly loved and was able to learn and get something out of every single comedian. Amazing and genius! Loved how womxn from all walks of live were able to gather together and be in unity. Beautiful is an understatement.",False
11,3,Disappointing,poor_ginger,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Grace and Frankie for the quick-witted -and snappy dialogue. If, like me, that's what you're expecting from this special, you'll be sorely disappointed.Jane and Lily are painfully awkward and over-scripted. We know that they can act, but it seems comparing is not their strongest suit.I honestly didn't laugh once at any of the guest comedians, either. This was either because of repetitive lockdown jokes, pedestrian material, or US-specific observations that people outside the country will struggle to understand.Such a pity for something supposed to celebrate women in comedy. Sadly, it has the opposite effect and only serves as a low yardstick by which to judge us.",False

1,7,James Cordon was bad choice,a-albalushi,n/a,16/08/2025,It takes you back and dig out those old laughs but the editing was big mess and all over the placeJames Cordon was definitely a bad choice.,False
2,7,Ruined by James Corden,thomasbgleeson,n/a,16/08/2025,A behind the scenes look at the 6 meeting up and reminiscing was enough and also the best part of the reunion. The obvious questions and terrible catwalk really made this a bit trashy. Why are people still hiring James Corden? Unfunny and unable to allow anyone else to talk. Was good but could have been much better.,False
3,7,"Alright, but I just can't stand Corden",eunbi0530,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a reunion special where the main cast reminisce about the past, we are shown some fans pov and how the show influenced their lives, some behind the scenes that maybe most people didn't know, it is a nice treat for a reunion, but I also understand those disappointed that were expecting for a follow-up episode after all these years.BTW I found it super weird the lack of references to either Ben or Emma.I wasn't a big fan of FRIENDS, yet I still found it a good reunion, but I just can't stand James Corden.",False
4,10,Where is emma??,knightmohsen,n/a,16/08/2025,Awesome seeing them together again and relive those moments but it missed a huge part. Where is emma?? They taped her first birthday to watch it back after 18 years which was 2020. It would have been really fun to see her after 18 years.,False

6,9,"Wonderful, Nostalgic, Stirring up memory & emotions",blackwar,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hooked up on Friends at its peak, happens to be when i was a foreign student studying in Texas, USA (1999-2003).I felt overwhelmed emotionally watching this Reunion show. Thanks again for the memory.Suddenly started to recall all the beautiful memory & international friends i had during my student years, some regularly sat together with me watching some of the episodes.Most profound...lovely, beautiful experience watching these 6 guys getting together!",False
7,n/a,"Amazing, just sorry about James Cordon",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was so happy to see the cast together in present time, hear them talk about the show and hear their thoughts and discussing old memories. It was really relatable. All the fun and mooving flashbacks and bloopers was just amazing. I was just so sorry that James Cordon tried to make this into a his own weird talk show. Other passages that wasn't with the cast were great, I actually really appreciated the short stories were people all over the world described how much this show has ment to them. I can really relate, Friends has been a show that has followed me for the last 15 years and I still enjoy it just as much as when I watched it the first time, I probably enjoy it even more now.Again - just sorry that James Cordon which I felt was so misplaced here tried to make this to something completely different than a meaningful nostalgic reunion.Overall so happy about this episode. Would have been even better with more behind the scene materials.",True
8,10,"I am not Crying, you are",sourabhauthenticmundra,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just beautiful reunion of 6 people who drink coffee and say funny things, for me F. R. I. E. N. D. S will always be the best show and this reunion is worth watching.",False
9,6,Great to see them!! Disappointed With random people,famousjax,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved seeing the group together!!! But could have done without all the strangers and celebs talking about how they felt about friends and the lady Gaga part? I fast forward the parts with the random peeps and celebs, as nobody cares about random people or any celebs besides the Friends cast and who worked on friends as The magic of the show is the friends!!! Keep it with that as that is what people want to see!",False
10,9,Only one thing spoiled it ...,jonsmithinbelper,n/a,16/08/2025,"... and that was the simpering, sycophantic nonentity called James Corden. On behalf of the UK, I wish to apologize to the USA for him being over there and on your screens: having said that, please don't send him back. Despite him, I thoroughly enjoyed the programme. It's plain to see they are all still good friends and the love between them shone through.",False
11,6,Matthew Perry: I don't hear from anyone.,drewnes,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a fan of the show, I wanted to love this so much, but I couldn't help but get sad. Why was this the first time they have set foot in the same room after all this time? I think Matthew Perry has gone through some hard times because he did not seem to be enjoying himself. The Fresh Prince of Bel Air Reunion had me feeling nostalgic and happy, where as this one had me feeling nostalgic and sad. Also where is Paul Rudd??",False
12,10,I laughed.....I cried.....,epoen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really didn't expect to enjoy this reunion. I wanted more Friends episodes, and maybe a Big Bang crossover episode. But traveling down memory lane as I watch this special, this is far better than I anticipated. It is definitely a fun and special....special. If you're a Friends fanatic, this is a must-see and a must have addition to your collection.",False
13,6,Mixed feelings,radufl,n/a,16/08/2025,"'Friends' was pretty good, and I always watch the reruns. Two decades later, we're all a bit older and less fun, however Jennifer Aniston and Courtney Cox look really weird - I have no idea why some good-looking celebrities mess up their faces when getting old. Matthew Perry was also looking tired and older than you would expect. On the other hand, Lisa Kudrow and Matt LeBlanc were really funny and seem happy with their looks.A lot of pointless and crap footage: some other celebrities (?) with no link to the show, a painful to watch Lady Gaga moment, fans of the show from other countries, a cheap fashion parade etc. Part of the reunion was hosted by the obnoxious James Corden, a very bad choice. I expected more former 'Friends' guest stars or additional cast to show up, but it wasn't possible apparently.The bloopers, rehearsal and unreleased scenes were interesting and quite funny, as well as some of the stories shared by the cast.Overall, I wasn't expecting much, but it could have been much better.",False
14,5,Could it... BE any more of a wasted opportunity?,Petaine,n/a,16/08/2025,"So, all that hype for this, huh?Well, it started okay, I had some laughs, but the more it went on, the more boring it got and I eventually ended up skipping scenes too. What's with all those randoms speaking about the show? No disrespect for these people, good for them, but put their takes on YouTube, don't waste precious screen-time for it! And while at it, what's with Beckham and BTS and Gaga and that cringefest fashion show? I'm here to see Friends for crying out loud, not Crawford and Bieber. You wanna do that runway part? Put guest stars of the show to do it!And what's with that host guy? Why not have a guest star ask them the questions? You know... someone we the fans can relate to?!Oh man, so much potential wasted. You have the cast of Friends and you put them on a table to re-do their scenes? Why not have them re-create the scenes on the actual sets, in full character and clothes? I mean, you have the sets available, don't you?! How funny would it be seeing Ross putting on that ""Frankie says relax"" shirt? Or Joey in the Sergio Valente skinny jeans, especially now that he put on a few pounds? Or Phoebe in the maternity pants, Rachel in the bridesmaid's dress and Monica in the fat suit? How funny would it be to have Ross and Monica make the routine?I understand that there may be certain limitations with Chandler but you could at least find a funny scene for him to re-create.So, so, so much of a wasted opportunity. Oh well...",False
15,9,why James Corden,michael_gunawan,n/a,16/08/2025,"It'll be better w. Graham Norton, Jimmy Kimmel.Any more ideas for the host ?",False
16,9,Rest in Peace Matthew Perry,DivineCove,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this 2 days after we learned that Matthew Perry had died, hoping to lessen my sense sadness for the loss of this gifted and troubled man. I came away with a greater appreciation for what these people created and will probably do a re-watch of the entire series. That said, this reunion program has it's highs and lows. I could have done without anything that had to do with the live audience in the park with James Corden, or any other bits that included cameo appearances by celebs not part of the show or tangental characters...except maybe Janice. These sections felt forced and cheesy. The strongest moments for me are when the Six are by themselves, reminiscing, or doing table reads that are followed by the actual footage. I also appreciated the background conversations with the show's creators. I wish (knowing where we are now) that there had been more opportunities for them to be more vulnerable and transparent with one another. Still, it is worth watching.",False
17,10,Homage to the Greatest TV series ever written,shtjkapoor,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a wonderful reunion.It felt like i was part of the this reunion with my friends. You will laugh and you will cry. You will become nostalgic and you will miss those old good laughs.To some of us, they were like family.This brought tears to my eyes. This series will always have a special place in my heart.",False
18,9,So wonderful seeing my FRIENDS again.,CainCrow50,n/a,16/08/2025,"Honestly i only didn't give it a 10 because of the useless, pointless James Corden.Otherwise this was absolute perfection. Sweet. Funny. Lovely. I loved it.",False
19,6,The James Corden segment sucks,MovieRankingReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Friends when I was younger and was rooting for a reunion episode. Well, they finally did it but instead of a time skip episode, we instead got a reunion of the actors reminiscing about their time on Friends. I was very disappointed by that as I really wanted to see where the characters I loved were up to. Nonetheless, I was still interested to watch it just because we haven't seen the actors together in a long time as well. So was it a happy reunion or unneeded?Firstly, I enjoyed watching the actors returning to the set and meeting each other again. Seeing them interact again, you could still see that they all still retain the chemistry between each other. It was interesting and fun to watch them just talk about their time on Friends such as their first meeting, their favourite moments and things that happened due to their fame. They also do some re-enactments of some great moments from the show and this was nice to watch as we see them easily bring these characters back to life again.I also really loved seeing them react to some clips from Friends as it was intriguing to know what they thought of it. It was also quite a blast to see them react to the bloopers as well, although I wish they included some more bloopers as well. They also reacted to that time Matt LeBlanc broke his shoulder on one episode which was just such a great moment. They also do a quiz show with the cast to see their knowledge on Friends which was hilarious. There are also some very interesting interviews from the creators of Friends about how the show came into being and why these actors were casted.However, my biggest issue with this special has got to be the atrocious editing. It constantly switches from actors reminiscing to talk show to documentary to quiz repeatedly. It's clunky and very messy. It's very jarring and annoying as it never seems to stay focus on one thing for long enough. It baffles me why it had to be a 100-minute special when they could've done episodes that focus on different things. They could have one episode of Friends cast reminiscing, one episode about how Friends was made and another episode being a quiz with the cast etc. The choice of having it all crammed together is a terrible choice and it doesn't work.There is a talk show segment with James Corden and I hated it. James Corden feels too hyperactive and obnoxious with his talk show segment taking too long or just being too awkward for my liking. I actually wouldn't have minded if they got rid of his segment entirely. There are some moments where it shows how Friends impacted non-celebrity people which was just too cringy and distracting. Some celebrities come in as well such as David Beckham and Kit Harrington where they talk about their favourite episode. However, I could give no care whatsoever to it and wanted them to go back to the Friends themselves. There is also a very weird segment that appears randomly with Lisa Kudrow singing ""Smelly Cat"" again which was great but then gets ruined by Lady Gaga and a random choir which was pointless additions. Lisa says it herself ""I think the song was better when I sang it alone"".Overall, when they let the Friends cast do their thing and the focus is just on them, it's great. When it keeps derailing to something else, it's bad. If you're a huge Friends fan then you definitely need to watch this. However, if you're just someone who knows about Friends and might like documentaries or something, then I can guarantee that there is not much worth watching this as you won't gain much. It might not be the reunion I wanted but there was some enjoyment to be had for sure.",False
20,10,I wish there was more!,matheu-lex,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't believe I had to wait 17 years for this! Soooo many good memories and laughs, so many afternoons waiting for a new episode!!!Watching them together again was... mind blowing!I wish there was more!What an amazing Sitcom!",False
21,7,Almost,tothbali,n/a,16/08/2025,"There wasn't enough new material or depths of the stories everybody wanted to hear. You didn't have time for Paul Rudd, Ben, Emma or Emily but you had Mindy Kailing and Lady Gaga and a bunch of random lesbians touched by the show?? You gave only 10 whole seconds to Gunther? A random african lady got more? Wow.It made me nostalgic and I still love the show and probably will rewatch it again, but I think the fans and the cast deserved something better than this rushed something with Corden. Graham Norton would have been a better host choice btw.",False
22,10,Most of us found this gem during a hard time in our Life.,asad2711,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know like me most of us found this masterpiece when we were going through some tough times and this show really was that little light inside the tunnel.I felt so good watching this ""Reunion"". Haven't felt this way watching anything for a long time. It was emotional, it was nostalgic and it was beautiful. I can never truly express in words what this show has meant to me.I hope that everyone whose reading this get through their hardships and struggles. I hope you all find happiness.Sending lots of Love to you all from Pakistan.",False
23,6,So Much Filler,deepfrieddodo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brilliant for anyone who was particularly obsessed with the show, but really Friends: The Reunion is nothing special, and probably a bit of a disappointment to others. It's great to look back, skim the surface of what was going on behind the scenes, and hear from some key people, but there is just so much filler.Irrelevant people are drafted in purely for fame's sake. Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Kit Harrington, Malala (?!) and so many others have absolutely nothing to do with the show, they hold no relevance. Yet they are shoehorned in to talk about their favourite episodes (no one cares) or explain scenes (which everyone has seen). What's worst about these people being shoved in is that it means that the actors behind characters such as Gunther or Janice are brought in for one line and then shipped out. Having James Corden host was just painful too, obviously they weren't going to bad-mouth anything regarding the show but he is such a brown-nose it's painful.It is good for some genuine moments with the core group, although they're hidden behind a lot of created skits. The real revelation is how much plastic surgery each member has had, at the beginning it's downright disturbing, with only Kudrow and Le Blanc looking vaguely natural. You do see some of the acting slip in reinactments, but mostly it's okay, although Le Blanc is the only one to really show any charisma.I'm sure many will love this, but in many ways it's just kind of sad.",False
24,5,James Cordon spoiled it.,DaRaja01,n/a,16/08/2025,"Was great seeing the whole game for together again, but why in the hell was James Corden the host. Also not much of that was in the interviews on the storylines would of liked to see a bit more.",False

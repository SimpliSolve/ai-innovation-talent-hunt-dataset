1,6,Insightful...,philip-00197,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerVerging more on the topic on; the difficulties of making a documentary, than that of how Hollywood becam Tinseltown.Pawel Ferdek sets out to find an explanation as to why the polish community, initially had such success in Hollywood (Warner, Goldwyn, Mayer). His initial aspirations well and truly derailed. Shifting focus he attempts to decode the recipe for success within the movie industry - fair to say that approach also falls flat on its face.Undeterred, and in true Hollywood spirit, Ferdek once again shifts focus. The end result becomes a documentary on; dreams, courage, failures and desperation. By a twist of fate, Pollywood became way more relevant - to way more people.You could argue Pollywood is not what it says on the package, that it doesn't follow any kind of script and that it doesn't deliver what it set out to do.But you could also lean back and allow the lack of structure to represent what most of us encounter on a daily basis.Arguably the level of chaos is greater for those who are willing to sacrifice ""everything"" in the pursuit of their dreams. But plans gone astray and disappointments are woven into the fabric of most lives - thus Ferdek somehow, manages to create a relevant sidetrack.However, Ferdek doesn't manage to fully embrace the changes his documentary is undergoing. Instead of following the new leads, he rather sternly clings to his original idea. The end impression is rather that he persisted in failure than that he jumped at the opportunity provided.",True
2,3,Totally misses the point.,brynn-settels,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you watch this documentary you'd think that Hollywood was created by Polish immigrants.
It manages to basically ignore the fact that they were Jewish. It's like like making a documentary about blues and say it was created by Americans, without mentioning they were black.
A Polish director, trying to give Poles credit for what was a Jewish creation, while the reason they left Poland was the terrible anti-s√©mitism. Not a word about why they left.",False
3,9,"Funny as hell, the most creative ""documentary"" ever",chervenkov,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thought it was really creative movie. Really messy structure and progression. The main character and director Pavel Ferdek is such a troll. There is one part, where he walks up to the policemen and says that they should let him in since Polish people originated Hollywood. Obviously big parts of the film were tongue and cheek. Enjoyed it as someone who is from Eastern Europe, the opening scenes showing his small town and how the Polish immigrants were doing all sorts of wacky stuff just not to starve.My favorite part were the conversations between Pavel and the big time directors and producers where the talk seems semi genuine, semi troll. He gives them vodka as a gift, how stereotypically funny is that.",False

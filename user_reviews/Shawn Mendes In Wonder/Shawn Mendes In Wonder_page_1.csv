1,8,"Enjoyed it overall, however...",katprichard,n/a,16/08/2025,"I couldn't quite figure out what their angle was. There's not enough tour footage for it to be a tour doc, not enough old footage of Shawn for it to be a biopic, etc. So that was quite confusing. I did end up liking it a lot though. If you're not interested in Shawn you probably won't like it, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie!",False
2,6,"Lots of Style, Not Much Substance",radrobd,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm a big fan of Shawn's music but I was expecting more into his personal struggles and rise to fame. It was pretty standard music doc without anything real. I like Shawn but it actually made him sound pretentious. I get that's musically talented but the attempts to portray him as just a regular guy fell flat and made him seem a little arrogant.It also glossed over his rise to fame and his MAGCON years. In one sentence they talked about how he went from doing Vines in his bedroom to becoming a superstar but without anything in between.Also we were promised a raw look at Shawn, but didn't really see much. Yeah he likes relaxing with his girlfriend when he's not on tour and doing ""regular"" things. Who doesn't? What about his insecurities and anxieties he always talks about? Briefly superficially mentioned.And the end climax where he has to cancel a show in Brazil because of his voice? Seen it before. Bieber's documentary and countless others have shown the same thing. And we know he's okay because he has a new album.In the end it'll please only his hardcore fans but anyone else might find it boring.",True
3,6,Lacking plot but good for fans,issy_w5,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA nice, enjoyable and nostalgic watch for fans but not much here for anyone else.",True
4,6,Meh,loklomail,n/a,16/08/2025,"Better than travis Scott one ngl.
Like I like both artist, but the travis Scott one was like just sayin his tour and stuff, people know what happens, you can just google it, but at least this gave some special things like Shawn's relationship with camila and stuff.
Not the best documentary, but certainly not the worst :/",False
5,7,Good but could have been so much more,deanjcooper,n/a,16/08/2025,It's sweet just safe way too safe. After witnessing the style of Billie Eilish's doco. I can't help but wonder how much better this could have been. It just felt too PG and Disney. I'm positive there was so much great unused footage that could have shaped this from good to iconic!,False
6,10,Loved every second!,pitmalischi_larisa,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou know ppl think that this must be like revealing something bad about Shawn or His life to be enjoyed and comment that the most interesting part is with the voice problem , that is not enough to be considered good, that is plain and simple But I think that Shawn is about that, simple and pure talent, down to Earth and the fact that for him to cancel a concert is so upsetting it just means that he respects His fans so much ... I am glad to see him soo loved and appreciated and have a strong bond with His gf. Love every second!",True
7,7,Standard documentary about a modern singer - Nothing groundbreaking but it's fine,nthonglam,n/a,16/08/2025,"I come to this without too much too much expectation because at the end of the day, the protagonist of a whole documentary is a 22 year-old. Even if he's world famous, Shawn's still a pretty unproblematic pop singer so I don't expect too much dramas or surprises to come along. A reviewer said that the drama comes across melodramatic and I agree.
I think the right mindset coming to this documentary is to not to have too much expectation, to know a little bit about Shawn's personality already (sweet, hopeless romantic, drama-free). Only then you can take it for what it is - a glimpse into Shawn Mendes' year of touring, little bit of family and friends, little bit of famous girlfriend, some aesthetic coming-of-age footage and some good jamming sessions.
I do enjoy it though, as much enjoyment as you can have watching a documentary about a modern pop singer with some success.",False
8,10,Wow,aglaehocquet,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cried a lot, tears of sadness, tears of joy
I can't explain how proud I am of this human.
I love shawn en what he does from the deepest of my heart.
Well done!",False
9,4,Fans of Shawn Mendes will find lots to enjoy here but not much for anyone else,Sir_AmirSyarif,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fans of Shawn Mendes will find lots to enjoy here. Unfortunately, there is not much in 'Shawn Mendes: In Wonder' for anyone else. The documentary only shows run-of-the-mill problems like imperfection mentality, insecurity, vocal problems, and homesickness, but refuses to reveal anything new, authentic, or interesting about the life of an incredibly popular musician. There is an attempt to add a touch of drama with a scare over Mendes' voice in the last act, but it does all come across as melodramatic rather than an actual concern. Shallow.",False
10,10,the best,thaynadesouza-03184,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just loved everything in this documentary, everyone should watch it. is inspiring and exciting, Shawn Mendes is a successful artist !!!",False
11,3,A lot of tears,mulderik-05971,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cried throughout the whole documentary, uncontrollably at the end. Not by how I was touched and moved by the documentary but by trying to rip my nails out during watching it.",False
12,10,Absolutely stunning,bbkivines-20824,n/a,16/08/2025,A great well shot documentary. Feel good and shows how humble and talented Shawn actually is,False
13,10,perfect!,sralarii,n/a,16/08/2025,"So emotional and beautiful, you can really feel connected with him. everybody should see this!",False
14,3,Not much here,lmkixx,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was an unfocused documentary in my opinion. I expected more than this. Wasn't about Mendes' childhood, not much on his family or inspiration. Nothing in depth on any of his relationships or inner thoughts. Just some repetitive concert clips, a visit home and a vocal injury and it's effect on a concert. Maybe they should have just done a concert documentary because this wasn't that interesting. It needed some realness, some insights into his character or something.",False
15,10,Amazing!!,aniekje_w,n/a,16/08/2025,I find it incredible what a beautiful person and amazing talent he is.,False
16,1,"Boring, dull",mariiroma,n/a,16/08/2025,"This boy is the definition of the white male privilege, he's so dull and boring and I don't know how he's filling stadiums. The documentary could have explained how he got there, which is what I was really expecting, but instead decided to be a documentary about nothing! There is no message! No story! Congratulations to those involved for filling so much time with so little content, that's a real talent.",False
17,10,just perfect üòç,daniellyr-46441,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the documentary it is possible to see and even feel a little what he goes through before concerts and tours, which you can feel incredible for having so many people have high expectations of you and hope that this never fail, difficulties with throat problems and the effort to always please everyone, ensuring that it is always an incredible experience to go to your shows, not to mention that we found out more about the history between him and Camila Cabello, we see some important points of his city for him, and his emotion and his difficulties, I certainly loved it too much",False
18,10,Wonderful,rimantejankunaite,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to know Shawn Mendes better, watch it. This documentary is sweet and touchy. The soudtrack fits perfectly, videos are so pure, honest and natural. Loved it!",False
19,3,Boring,kimpoychiu,n/a,16/08/2025,Don't like it. It's genuinely fake. A lot of people knows what's real or not.,False
20,10,loved it,mclarabn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very happy to feel more connected to my idol, this documentary is so incredible.",False
21,1,Very superficial and dull,simone_elmgreen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not really sure, what I was watching. The documentary seems to lack focus and there isn't really any raw or real conversations from Shawn, it seems very polished. Or maybe he just isn't that interesting. I'm sure fans of his music will adore it and leave loads of (undeserved) 10 star reviews, but if you're not a fan, then don't bother watching it.",False
22,10,Amazing!!!!!,juliaroberta-53409,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary is the incredible and we can see how talented shawn is!!,False
23,10,Shawn Mendes documentary rocks,paulroberts-53775,n/a,16/08/2025,"At a very young age Shawn is a global superstar,he is a kind hearted fellow who cares about his family and friends especially camilla cabello.
I liked his music before but after this documentary about his 2019 tour,I'm a fan because believe or not this guy is humble.
So if you are a fan or a casual listener of his music this Netflix documentary will be a good watch and learn something about this amazing young man at the start of his phenomenal career.",False
24,2,The 10 star ratings are clearly diehard fans,thefendiprint,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI went into this not particularly caring for Shawn but I do also like a few of his songs so I said why not. Unfortunately like many other reviewers have mentioned, this doc has no real focus, plot or point. It wants you to think we are seeing deep inside who Shawn is, how he got to where he is, raw emotions, the usual documentary/biopic storyline etc etc. However, this is almost nothing of the sort. Sure there are scenes of the tour, and there are scenes of him recording. But all that's actually here for display is your ""average"" boring straight white male privilege. It doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of who really IS Shawn Mendes. I feel like I know just as much about him as I did before and that's not a very good thing is it?Now, does that make him a bad guy? Not at all. But that doesn't mean you need a feature documentary when you have nothing to show or talk about. I should feel engaged, not bored out of my mind. There is nothing deep here at all, and it is probably one of the most shallow and pointless docs I've seen. Skip this unless you are a diehard fan, because you quite literally won't miss anything.",True
25,10,Perfect!,mariafernandagondim,n/a,16/08/2025,"He's the most sweet and dedicated person in world. So talented and lovely with the fans... deserves all the love, respect, successful and happiness in the world",False

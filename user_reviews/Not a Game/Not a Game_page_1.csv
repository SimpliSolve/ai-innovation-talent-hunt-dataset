1,7,A nice documentary to show the real failure of parents and parenthood in modern society,sevliadis-kostas,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a nice documentary for gamers and non alike. If you have any problems with your kids you have to remember they're kids and it's you as a parent who needs to discipline them..not the other way around..because a kid will always be a kid..it's the adults responsibility.,False
2,6,Is this just fantasy?,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well it can become real life for some ... it starts off quite good to be honest. Showing off the rage games can actually conjure ... but trying to show many different aspects of gaming too. In many different countries too ... which I mean there is so much spanish in this, I was a bit put back by that ... but that is me.On the other hand this shows that it cares about gaming all around the world. Still this can't actually paint the broad picture it sets out to do ... it was never going to achieve that. Cliches and all that will creep up on us and the documentary ... still there are some nice little nuggets and some interesting little stories we get to see. So I've seen way better documentaries, but also far worse.",False
3,2,No Idea what they are trying to say,wtoner-74928,n/a,16/08/2025,"This feels like a person with a very superficial knowledge of games has just done a disorganised brain dump of everything they know. There's no obvious narrative and I'm completely unsure what the point of the documentary is. Rambling, meandering poorly structured waste of time.",False
4,1,Bland and boring,ehudmi,n/a,16/08/2025,Confused documentary gets boring pretty fast. Trying to maneuver between the pros and cons of gaming.Unfortunately what is clearly obvious once again is it's mostly the old and the do-gooders who are con and the young and the business sector are pro.It's a little like watching a political debate. It's not about facts but mostly about beliefs.I believe gaming is the future. It's here for now and may or may not last but being against it is simply being a luddite.We deserve better documentaries. If possible use facts and not beliefs. After all it's supposed to be documentary. Not drama and not a morality play...,False
5,4,Messy,theimacman,n/a,16/08/2025,"A video game documentary that spelled it ""Mortal Combat"", for shame.",False
6,8,"Many bad reviews because there are ""too many"" subtitles.",brunosastre,n/a,16/08/2025,"Probably americans are not used to subtitles and it makes more difficult to get the whole picture. Stop being lazy, please.",False
7,4,"Unfortunately, this is quite bad",Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel like if you're into gaming this isn't going to tell you much you don't already know, and if you're not into gaming, you're probably going to find it boring and too scattershot to really get much information out of.It jumps around so much- that's my main criticism. It bounces from one topic to the next with very little by way of segues or any sense of flow, and it's remarkably frustrating. It might be forgivable if more of the individual stories were interesting, because while some are decent, other segments are really boring.While I appreciate the effort at presenting a somewhat global look at gaming throughout the world, maybe the broad focus was what led to it being so all over the place, unfocused, and ultimately unsatisfying. It could have just been too ambitious, and I think this particular type of documentary approach is far more suited to a miniseries, rather than a 90-something minute long documentary.",False
8,1,Great example of telling people good things about their bad habits,Ruskington,n/a,16/08/2025,This incredibly one-sided documentary is little more than a bunch of dubious 'experts' and 'pro gamers' romanticising their lame addictions. Yes there may be some small positives for certain unfortunate individuals (who are used mercilessly as pity-bait) but the case for gaming addiction being anything other than a mental illness and serious societal problem is laughable. Throw in some lame woke rambling from this wretched assortment of 'urban strategists' and 'gaming consultants' and you have one of the worst documentaries of recent years.,False
9,1,Mess,maytekinaliyeva,n/a,16/08/2025,Thousand languages in one documentary.my brain got burned down.after one point gave up reading subtitles then stopped watching altogether.,False
10,2,Can't watch must read,potterworld,n/a,16/08/2025,I generally enjoy a good documentary but what's the point of watching a documentary if 75 to 90% of it is reading subtitles.,False
11,8,A must watch for parents with children who play video games,peter-114-840499,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some of the bad reviews put me off initially. But I'm glad I did watch and I felt I should write something here.This is a very good documentary, with some interesting stories that show the impact video games have in people's lives.I feel it should have been a series, maybe 4 episodes as it packs a lot in 90 minutes. But that is a minor issue compared to the insights.Some of the reviews on here are completely miss-leading, complaining about subtitles is a poor approach when reviewing a documentary and it is obvious to me that some people just haven't watched it.If you have children who play games or you are a gamer yourself, this is a must watch.If you don't care about games, this is also must watch.",False
12,1,A scaring crusade,eliavnnn,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentry is bad almost as bad as it's made.A pointless scaring crusade against gaming.There is nothing bad about our kids gaming. We need to be better parents. Explain and talk.Netflix took all the worst cases in the world, putting it in one angry movie with a very firm agenda. Garbage.",False
13,8,A different documentary for gamers and no gamers alike,mark_1187,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am into video games and I've seen most of the gaming/esports documentaries out there and this one has a complete different approach. It is a gaming documentary for the ones who love gaming and specially the ones who don't.It is a balanced movie supported by experts, pro gamers, gamers and families.The stories let the viewer make their own judgement, educate and give the audience the opportunity to empathise with the experiences of real people, some of them very tough.Gaming and Pro gaming are here to stay, have revolutionised entertainment like never before and the good surpass by far the bad.If you are a gamer, a pro gamer, but specially a parent or someone that has no interest at all in games, this is for you. Human and different... A must watch.",False
14,10,Best gaming documentary I have seen so far!,zeno-zokalj,n/a,16/08/2025,"High Score was fun. Part because I'm a gamer and part because I've met some of those gamedev in my career.But this is something else. This is a true scientific and educational documentary that explains phenomena of video games, esports and gaming culture. It will help parents understand today's world and help them find a way to communicate with their children.As a gaming dad, I knew most of these things but here it's all laid out in simple language so people who are not in gaming can understand it better, at least for the sake of their kids.Video games don't cause violence, people do. Just as you don't kill people after hearing a death metal song, just as you don't blow up a building with C4 because you saw John McLane do it in Die Hard.If anything, games offer people who are frustrated (often in dysfunctional families as a source) a way to get rid of that frustration and to run away from all the things they have to put up with during the day. Maybe bullied at school, maybe having abusive parents, being introverted, gay or something else that might get them undeserved hate or mocking.But seeing all those people who were saved by gaming was so emotional and I hope it will help people understand all the benefits of gaming. And as they say in the trailer. You don't want your kid to play games 12 hours a day, but you don't want them to watch TV, climb trees or read for 12 hours straight.Boundaries are important, but boundaries should be set with at least basic knowledge of the subject we're restricting in one way or another.Today people are finally getting the difference between watching hours of movies and series and hours of gaming. Gaming has many benefits that movies and series do not have. Eye hand coordination, reflexes, connecting to people online worldwide, creating bonds and friendships with those people while TV is totally devoid of that and you are just fed with often meaningless content with no interaction on your part. And that makes us less healthy in the long run. Mentally and physically.I often hear how parents limit their child's gaming sessions to 30 minutes per day. I would like to ask them if they do that themselves. Do they stop a movie after 30 minutes and continue next evening for another 30 minutes? Because it's similar. Not the same, because the time their kid spends building their city in Minecraft is doing miracles for developing their imagination, while the time spent in front of the TV doesn't have any health benefits.Watch it and try to understand it.I don't know who is review bombing this movie, but it's comical at best.Especially the 1 star review which said: ""Thousand languages in one documentary.my brain got burned down.after one point gave up reading subtitles then stopped watching altogether.""That's exactly what too much television does to you.",False
15,8,computer gaming is...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"A universal phenomenon that everybody does... just not me... but my 3 sons do the tricks, and ive had my time of ignorant opposition towards their all time consuming activities in the dark stinky bear hives, drinkink cola and doing the peepee in the empty one because theyre too busy doing game , forgetting the toilette duties, when i mentioned pampers up and go once for my youngest (18) the game controller came flying and i had to flee the scene of outragous anger...but this is a managabel documentary with a good pr for the gaming communities and soforth, even convincing me the grumpy old man that gaming aint as bad as i thought. Im just convinced that physical excersise and real sport on an amateur level aint as bad as the young ones of today thinks...but i will absolutely recommend this one, could be a holy grail to emphasize their hobby and activities, i guess its a better moral builder than watching e-porn 24/7...",False
16,8,Great variety of topics awful on screen text color choice,niobe-999-328831,n/a,16/08/2025,Had so much fun with this documentary but I was very frustrated with the inability to read people's names and titles and such because the white text blends with the background the majority of the time.,False

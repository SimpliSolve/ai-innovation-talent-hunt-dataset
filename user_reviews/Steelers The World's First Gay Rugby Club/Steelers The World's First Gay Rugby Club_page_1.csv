1,8,Rugby is not a gentle sport,Red-125,n/a,16/08/2025,"Steelers: the World's First Gay Rugby Club (2020) is an English documentary written and directed by Eammon Ashton-Atkinson.Rugby is a very physical game, and the players don't wear protective gear. If you have the stereotype that gay men can't play rugby, think again.The Steelers are an all-gay team, and they are tough. Director Ashton-Atkinson is a member of the team, but an injury kept him from playing for the Bingham Cup, which is the most important tournament in gay rugby.We follow, two players--Simon Jones and Andrew McDowell. Most interesting to me was the coach, Nic Evans. She is a former rugby player and a lesbian. However, she encounters misogyny even from the gay men.The question to be answered is whether the Steelers can win the Bingham Cup. They were the first gay rugby club, and they're an excellent club, but they've never won the Bingham Cup.We learn at the start of the movie that the Steelers reached out to straight rugby clubs at the beginning. However, they were rebuffed. Now they apparently play only other gay teams.I learned from Wikipedia (not the movie) that gay clubs do play straight clubs, and that some clubs are ""inclusive."" Rugby is definitely not my sport, but movies help you learn about matters outside your comfort zone.We saw this film as part of Rochester's great ImageOut LGBTQ Film Festival. It doesn't yet have enough ratings to be meaningful. I liked it, and rated it 8.",False
2,10,Emotionally engaging portrayal,awrvy,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great documentary that captures the journey for many gay men, through the eyes of a few players from the world's first gay rugby club.The journey towards belonging is poignant and is one that everyone in the cinema related to, in what was a very vulnerable and honest portrayal. Not a dry eye around.A recommended watch for anyone wanting to relate to someone (or themself) coming to terms with being gay. Thanks team :)",False

4,10,Powerful documentary,xxywqmcyv,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely loved this documentary! The stories of these individuals, what they've been through, what they've overcome and how they all come together to form this fantastic rugby team was just so well told. It was emotional, heartbreaking and uplifting. 10/10.",False
5,3,Bit dull,craiglesuk-1,n/a,16/08/2025,As a gay man who loves sport I'm afraid I found this a bit dull and uninspiring to be honest. Personally I would like to have learned about more of the players. Focusing on just three people left me a bit disconnected. There was also far too much time spent on the coach (and far too many tears) and yet we were never told why she was moving on? I was interested In Simons story but that was about it. I feel like the documentarian wanted to connect with the viewer emotionally but he needed to dig a lot deeper for that.,False
6,10,Real people with real stories... loved it!,michaelschuddinck,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary has so much heart, and touches some of the bases on the underlaying issues within the LGBTQ community. It is great to see people speak out and poor their stories within something, we can relay to. It is heartbreaking, but as well uplifting and has one of the most powerful messages I have seen in recent LGBTQ cinema. It is real, it is open to anyone and the documentary is well made. Standing ovation to the creator and the people within this documentary, as it has been a long time coming, to see something which really reflects within the community and isn't a pastiche. Keep your box of kleenex within distance.",False

12,10,An important piece of film making about a side of gay life you don't often hear about,leighholmwood,n/a,16/08/2025,An interesting and important piece of film making that shines a light on an area of gay life you don't often hear about - gay rugby. It shows why being part of a community of like minded people and having a safe space where you can be your authentic self is something we should all have access to. And it's just nice seeing a group of people coming together to do something they are so passionate about. Go the Steelers!,False
13,10,Amazing documentary showing the true impact of team sport,mtyfmjx,n/a,16/08/2025,Through individual experiences and narratives this documentary shows what a positive impact this club has had on just a few of its members.

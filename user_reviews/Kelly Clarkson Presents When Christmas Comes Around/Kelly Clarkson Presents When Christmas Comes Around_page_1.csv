1,8,Kelly Clarkson Presents: When Christmas Comes Around,studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"An excellent festive special to go hand in hand with an excellent festive album. It's hard to make one, let alone two, and that's what Kelly Clarkson has done.She comes across as being very genuine too, which a lot of the stars who do this sort of thing don't, and that goes a long way.One of my highlights of the festive tv schedules, thanks to ITV2 for showing it here in the UK.",False

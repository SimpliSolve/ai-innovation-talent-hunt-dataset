1,8,Giving hope.,Sillyreviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film shows a beautiful portrayal of an amazing skater that just happens to be trans. It shows how devastating and hard it is to deal with dysphoria but also how to find a possible way out of it. Leo the person that the documentary revolves around is truly amazing and truly takes you into his life and the hardships the he faces. He is an real fighter and that is really what this documentary shows, how difficult it can be to be ""different"", to need to fit in because otherwise you can't progress in the industry you love but also how you can breakout of that and that hiding your true self isn't a long term option. The film is incredibly inspirational and gives hope. I only can say one thing watch it!",False
2,9,inspiring,reborn-966-808248,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just saw this documentary with my girlfriend. I found it wonderful. Important that it is seen by everybody. Amazing that he stepped out of the competition, not going to the olympics.She wanted to be a he, so simple. No matter what reason, he felt it in his bones in his being that he was not in the right body. Many people feel that way.I don't feel that way I feel in the right body but we should not judge if somebody feels different. Finally deep inside we are all human beings with a heart and Leo has a beautiful heart. :) Kagib.",False

He deserves the world and nothing less . Period. This documentary is raw, real, and the most down to earth authentic experience I've seen. I hope this helps to educate people who don't have a lot of insight of this subject or topic. It's very helpful to see through his eyes. The 1 star review below is based on someone's beliefs about the topic which is wrong bc it has nothing to do with the quality of the documentary. The doc is amazing whether you agree with what's in it or not. He is amazing.",False
4,5,Boring after a while,dawiddgk,n/a,16/08/2025,I invested my time into Leo story and at first it was fine. Early days/ skateboarding / having fun and all that jazz.Unfortunately after maybe 30minutes the documentary became another trans/ i am sorry person drama which i don't really like.I enjoyed Tony Hawk story and it was much more engaging despite he's just about money but this feels like a story about trans person who is lost in his life.I do enjoy watching people who follow their carrer despite the circumstances and changes in life but i would gladly see more of the baker team/ neen Williams / interviews or even some old footage but no. There is nothing like that.,False
5,10,sick as hell!,sam-66013,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved this story, super inspiring.At the core it's about our choices in life - do we choose the easier path, or do we choose the path that might be harder, but we know is right for us.",False
6,10,I love Leo!,riordanholly,n/a,16/08/2025,"Truly inspiring and heartwarming and totally made me love the person Leo is. This is definitely more about lifestyle rather than purely leo's skate career, but thats fine, we are all humans at the end of the day who have lives and have struggles. I ended the movie feeling good and empowered to embrace myself whatever that may be.To negative reviewers who are still using incorrect pronouns after still watching this film - take your hate elsewhere, and educate yourself.Shout out to Alex white was cool to see her on the big screen.",False
7,10,Heartwarming,nrgigaba,n/a,16/08/2025,I didn't know Leo Baker before this documentary but after watching the trailer for the documentary I wanted to watch it.The love and support he got from those around him was just heartwarming. I love seeing how his world opened up when he stopped pretending to be who he is not and started being himself.We need more stories like this to be told.,False

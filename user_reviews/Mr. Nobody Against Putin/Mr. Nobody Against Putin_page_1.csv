1,8,In the shadow of power,andreasonne_,n/a,15/08/2025,"In an age where autocracy tightens its grip and dissenters disappear without a trace, this documentary emerges as a stark and timely reflection on resistance. The film follows an everyman who finds himself inadvertently drawn into a quiet confrontation with one of the world's leaders. The title is evoking Kafkaesque anonymity, and the film's greatest strength is its restraint. There are no grandstanding monologues just the suffocating tension of a man who loves his country, his town, his presence in society, but is against the regime and the war against Ukraine.Visually, Mr. Nobody Against Putin captures the haunting contradictions of modern Russia. The beauty of a frozen landscape at minus 45 degrees sits uneasily alongside the brutalist remnants of Soviet architecture. There is warmth in the people, their resilience, their humour but also the omnipresence of state control. The film lingers on chilling images: children marching through school corridors, clutching rifles with solemn determination.The documentary does not offer easy catharsis. It does not promise a hero's victory or a resolution. Instead, it delivers something more unsettling: a creeping awareness that injustice can happen anywhere. To anyone. When they least expect it.",False
2,7,How relevant it is makes it emotional and heartwarming,peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.The exploration of how Pavel Talankin navigates through the school's in Russia and the politics he surrounds himself and others makes a more emotional and purposeful observation. With good camerawork, fun energy and a likable personality from Pavel himself, Pavel Talankin doesn't shy away from the conflicting politics happening in the current times in Russia and offers to make sacrifices to show the issues and what is needed to be explored.With good music work, discussions from people, and emotionally explorations of the themes of innocence and war, the filmmakers including Pavel makes things thoughtful and great. Especially with how Russia and the current politics are happening, it touches me and I feel invested with the journey Pavel was in.Obviously, it does suffer from some pacing issues regarding the midpoint but I did enjoy it. As a whole, I do hope Pavel Talankin remains safe because knowing how Russia is and their system, Pavel has risked himself and I hope no further troubles will carry around with him for long.",False
3,8,Fighting militarization and propaganda in a Russian school,Dilip,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw 'Mr. Nobody Against Putin' at a film festival in early April 2025. Not only did I enjoy the film, especially learning about the fun and brave main character and co-director Pavel ""Pasha"" Ilyich Talankin, but I got to enjoy a Q&A session and later talk with the other co-director, David Borenstein.Pasha is from a town of 10,000 in the Ural Mountains of Russia and has a job of organizing events and documenting them and everyday life at a school (K-12?). Things change dramatically when Russia invades Ukraine and schools are asked to give not just scripted patriotic pro-war education, but also are exposed to military education, including marching in uniform, having grenade throwing competitions, and more.Pasha is a hero; he loves his students who look to him for safe conversations and a space in his video office/classroom. What he does in the face of government militarization of the classroom makes for a fascinating story.",False
4,10,All Too Relevant,rhiannonkatrin,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hi Pasha,I took my brother to see this today at Sundance (it's his birthday tomorrow and he lived in Eastern Ukraine from 2017-2019) and we were both so intrigued and touched by your film.One thing that deeply impressed me was the way that you used your talents and position to resist. So often I feel like I don't have power to make a real difference in my community or my country, but your film was such a powerful testament to how we really can by using the tools and gifts at our disposal.It was also so deeply relevant, not only to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but also to the propaganda that we see currently in the United States. It was a powerful reminder to me of the active role I need to take at home in trying to seek out truth and share it as well as I can.Your love and care for Russia, the children in your school, and your community, was evident throughout the film. Sometimes, the greatest form of love and patriotism is dissent, which you've done so courageously here. Despite the horrors you exposed, it was genuinely beautiful and hopeful. Spectacular work. Sending so much warmth and love.",False
5,10,An intimately human look into the heart of Russia,ericstonehill,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWas VERY fortunate to have caught a showing of Mr Nobody Against Putin at Sundance. Pasha is an adept cameraman and storyteller who swiftly takes the audience directly into his town and his life, as well as into the lives of several students and teaching colleagues as Putin snuffs out free-thought in their national education system.Pasha acknowledges the risks he's taking and perseveres against an impending noose, so that the world can have this universally human view into a Russia rarely seen outside of their country. Amazing film. Amazing work. We all hope this war ends as soon as possible and I wish for Pasha's continued safety.Additionally, here in Salt Lake City, we also have copper mining and metal smelting operations that contribute significantly to our pollution. That, unfortunately, hit close to home from so far away.",True
6,10,Must see movie,vcstqdc,n/a,15/08/2025,"Pasha, I just had the pleasure of watching your film at Sundance. It was absolutely incredible! The camera work and film quality were brilliant. Thank you so much for the information that you shared and the risks you took to send it. Thank you for your bravery.To everyone looking to watch this film please do not hesitate. Regardless of your political position or beliefs I think you will find this movie informative. The pacing is excellent and the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat as you become invested in this tiny town and the hardships that come for its citizens who are being drawn into the war. It's an incredibly relevant and important film.Thank you again to everyone who worked on this! Well done!",False
7,10,Amazing film at Sundance,dmcclain-30182,n/a,15/08/2025,"We saw your film at Sundance and it was amazing! The film itself was outstanding, but I am more impressed by your courage and humanity in doing this for the rest of the world. We always think how can one person change things, and usually give up at that point, but the fact is that unless individuals like Pasha stand up, the world will never change. There is a lesson here for Americans under our present regime. The themes of ""enemies within"" etc. Are all too real. We are hoping your friends in Karabash will be able to see this and take courage from your story. I am also curious about the loyalist history teacher, was there more depth than the party apparatchnik would suggest? Were the tears at the graduation ceremony real?Thank you!!!!Don and Deb McClain and Bob and Annette Cooksey.",False
8,10,"Great film, fantastic storytelling & message",lilahuizenga,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched the film during a screening at Sundance and along with the rest of the audience I laughed, and cried, and experience a range of emotions in between. Great storytelling. The narration, the choice of videos used, and the storylines woven together felt thoughtful and purposeful.As someone who's felt run down by the news over the last 3 years, this film gave me a bit of hope. And a push to continue speaking out and helping the people who are.Thank you for the work that's been put into this film and all the sacrifices made. I'd recommend for others to watch the film - you will enjoy it!",False
9,10,Amazing !!! Your are the bravest man ever,dana-826-608246,n/a,15/08/2025,"We watched your movie at the Full Frame Festival in Durham today: Pasha: You need to know an entire three level theater stood and clapped for you today. Your movie brought us all to tears... your sensibility, sense of humour, striking courage and kindness is a diamond shining over our declining world. The love you have for your students, your school and your community truly came through in the intimate interaction you were able to capture in your videos. We felt a personnal connection with the student whose brother was sent to Ukraine and our hearts are breaking for these families and the sufferting they must be feeling right now. We hope your movie can enpower others to stand up. We all need to do that while we can here in the US! We think about you Pasha and wish you happiness in your new private life and career!",False
10,10,Must watch - Heartening and important film,Dugongplayer,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe story follows Pasha, the type of teacher some of us were lucky enough to know, who provided a safe space for the school's misfits. He films the propaganda machine as it grows and evolves following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There are a lot of times when you laugh in this movie, it brings a light heart to a very heavy subject. But ultimately you are left with a dystopic view of what war does to regular people and particularly children. Pasha sacrificed life as he knew it in a small town in a country he loves to bring us this story. It's incredible that a film was able to be stitched together by the co-directors and editor in a way that is very enjoyable to watch. Part of that enjoyability is the excellent soundtrack.",True
11,10,Eye-opening and ever important,martinpersson97,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis incredible, very ever relevant, and all around incredible political thriller documentary, is definitely a treat, and a highlight of the year.It features some very prominent issues and questions and offers a unique insight and view, seldom seen. Very beautifully written and paced, and eye-opening for the somewhat uninitiated. Well put together indeed.The cinematography, cutting and editing is stellar, a very beautifully made feature, artistically, yet realistically made. Immensely beautifully put together indeed.Overall, a film everyone should see. Be it lover of film, or otherwise. A very Impossible feature!",True

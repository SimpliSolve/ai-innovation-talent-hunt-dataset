1,9,A First and A First in So Many aspects,julmo-884-710515,n/a,15/08/2025,"I might be slightly bias in my rating as I have a daughter who has Downs Syndrome
That said Otto's idea are brilliantly brought to screen by Pete&Bruce The story is a mash up of Otto's life as an adopted unwanted baby&the many horror films he has obviously watched&studied. Its short,scary,& will stand the test of time as a Gothic horror,Reminds me of so many movies in the gothic era. Its not about Downs Syndrome. Its a story of cruelty, evil, strength,courage, friendship and its funny too. A brilliant effort if you can watch the documentary coming out on SKY soon it puts everything into context.",False
2,n/a,"Like Otto, shame about the credits",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Came across this documentary and found Otto a very likable character to spend time with and the doc interesting despite the home video quality. It's cheaply put together and despite this the central character Otto who's back story we discover and follow as he makes a micro budget short horror film comes across as very likeable while taking on his challenges.A shame having read afterwards that the two television producers have entered them selves for awards as the two sole directors of this documentary when clearly Otto should have been one of the two directors. A shame the producers didn't feel they should credit Otto as a co-director (a big part of the documentary is the film footage he directed). This gives a bad look of the TV producers taking advantage of the character then claim to be wanting to help, that is until it comes to chasing awards.",False

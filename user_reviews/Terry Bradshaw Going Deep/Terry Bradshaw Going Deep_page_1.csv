1,8,Terrys One Man Show,Theedg3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very good special from HBO. This is a look at the life and career of Terry Bradshaw told by the man himself. He's the show here - telling stories, opening up about issues, talking the highs, the lows while also singing and telling jokes on stage. Surprisingly emotional, powerful at times when Terry opens up about things. Surprised to see low ratings.",False
2,2,Terry needs to retire from television,Xavier_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"His antics on the NFL broadcasts are getting old and he is sometimes losing his train of thought. It's a tough assignment and the other hosts are just helping him limp along at this point.He already has a television show about his ranch which is similar to the Kardashians if you want to see that type of tv. Basically a show about nothing, heavily scripted with made up drama.This show is no different and is heavily scripted. I'm not even sure who the audience is. If he's reading lines from a teleprompter who is writing it?",False
3,10,Just as the title says Terry goes deep with this one.,tynelson-38932,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is amazing. I started watching fox nfl pregame when I was a young steelers fan, learning about who Terry Bradshaw was to the Steelers country. But to see this show have a great mix of the Terry Bradshaw I waited all week to watch on Fox every Sunday morning, and a serious ""this is what this life really does to people"" is honestly amazing! I am so glad to see this and coming to find out even more about his life then I did. Truly a remarkable figure to look at.",False
4,3,"Terry in Branson, Missouri",algernonsidney,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a lifelong Steeler fan. Terry gives some great insights now and then. He shows his humility and gratitude for the people in his life.I don't care about Terry as a singer or a comedian. There was way too much of that garbage in this show. I would have liked more interviews with people in his life. I would have liked more clips from his career.There isn't much value here, even if you love the Steelers. In fact, I seriously wonder why he would put his name on something like this. Terry's life is a great story, but this just seems like an exercise in vanity for the sake of vanity. Who wants to hear Terry sing?By the way, Terry didn't go to Art Rooney's funeral either.",False

Also classic old playing footage and interview clips are shown of Terry and he talks and gives his takes on the past it's all covered from his humble rural Louisiana upbringing to his drafting to the NFL and his early struggles with coach Noll. However the Steelers team would build up and Terry would win 4 Super Bowls! Yet Bradshaw telling of his lows are honest and emotional as he reveals how his depression and splits with ex wives affected him. Thru it all Terry became bigger than life on TV with FOX's NFL coverage. One thing is for sure Terry learning to throw the ball at a young age has always helped him go deep on the field and in life and no matter when down Bradshaw has gotten up and thrown even harder and deep. So if you are a football fan or sports history fan and admire the legendary Terry Bradshaw watch this excellent ""Going Deep"" doc.",False
6,10,A look inside,Stleto,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe show was very entertaining. I like that he is showing his vulnerability before and after his playing days. As a Steeler fan - most of the game flashbacks were fond memories of days of yore. While he might be suffering with depression - it seems that's getting more comfortable with himself as a person. There's one part of the show where an audience member spoke of how he suffers from depression, and he thanked Terry for sharing his story. I felt that was very heartwarming. So - if you have HBO -- take an hour out of your day to see a different side of Terry. It's worth it.",True

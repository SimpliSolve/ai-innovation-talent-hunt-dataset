1,9,"Special, heartwarming film",prberg2,n/a,15/08/2025,"Really special film. I learned alot about Marlee and her story, but also the deaf community. I loved how the film showed the importance of communication, and without that, many in our world lose that important connection to others. It was a little bit 'chaotic' but I think that might have been somewhat intentional for someone from the hearing perspective. Took a bit to keep up with everything going on in the film, but I feel that gives us a tiny glimpse into what it's like to be a deaf person. Hopefully a little more empathy as well. An emotional journey with lots of fun and heart as well. Some really funny parts too. Well done and a really enjoyable film.",False
2,6,Somewhat dry but still inspiring and emotional,peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.The emotional journey of Marlee Matlin is well intended as the exploration of her career and her personal lives is explored thoroughly to provide an understanding of what she goes through, her life and why she is an important figure for Hollywood and for the deaf community. With a good sense of time and editing choices, this documentary does a pretty solid work on telling who Matlin is with some good discussions and tone approaches.Disabled actors getting the chances for fame is something that I loved to see more. Allowing them more opportunities and chances makes me feel good inside and that more people are getting the chances that they won't ever think of. This documentary does offer some solid decent presentation choices. However, I did wish the documentary had been a bit better executed regarding with some topic approaches like her career as an actress and other aspects. Because some of the discussions felt like you could read her page of Wikipedia to learn about her, which does causes to lose a few of its steam and emotional impact.Otherwise, I appreciate this documentary. Giving the chances and Matlin a voice to say on the behalf of the deaf community.",False

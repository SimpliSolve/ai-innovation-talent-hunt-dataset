1,8,Inspired to find out more,caroleanne-57166,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is beyond beautiful and I found it far more moving than I could ever have imagined. Seeing nature developing like that - especially the animals growing into their natural selves - was just gorgeous.I watched the film with a people from both our local Environmental group and Climate Action group and we were all deeply moved by the way animals help nature to heal itself. At the end we had questions around how the estate supports itself - camping there isn't expensive and nor are the wildlife tours they do, so hardly enough to support such a huge estate and country house (complete with battlements!)I felt that it could have gone into so much more depth around how healing the land benefits farming, how they manage the land and the animals, how they make enough money to support the estate. They talk briefly about the need for it to support itself but never any more than that.And they talk about how challenging it was to tread a path that caused so much strong reaction and hint at the end that this is changing or has changed, but don't develop that theme either.So I really, really loved the film and would have given it 10 out of 10 for sheer beauty and inspiration, but felt that it could have developed quite a few of the themes to make it more informative rather than just inspirational.",False
2,8,Just sit back and enjoy it!,bjfssk,n/a,16/08/2025,"There seem to be extremely positive and extremely negative comments generated by this film which is interesting. I found the best way to view this was to sit back and just enjoy the journey. Of course it's highly edited and geared to show only one outcome: what the land CAN do if we let it. That's a hugely valuable experiment that few dare to take on, whatever the motivations.The detail - the obvious wealth involved, the actual animal management, the final settlement of the controversies with neighbours - could be argued forever. Without going into the rights and wrongs this film is a cinematically beautiful product and it hits the spot in surprising ways. If nothing else it makes us think outside the box. This was a visual feast and came with an eye-opening view of what's possible! Let's celebrate that at least!",False
3,6,Wilding,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's something quite fascinating about the recuperative ability of the land to recover from centuries of man's abuse displayed in this documentary. Isabella Tree and husband Charlie have inherited a country estate that can barely manage to grow weeds. The soil is knackered and desperate action is required. They hit on the fairly radical idea of abandoning the place to nature (except their front lawn!) and the film now follows the reclamation of this space by birds, bugs, deer, pigs, cattle - creatures that would have roamed the land freely a few hundred years ago. They even bring in storks! It's a stunning piece of photography to look at, but the underlying narrative is really quite weak and I found it allowed sentiment to overrule the one thing it fails to address - scalability. They live in a castle with no evident money worries. None that we are told about, anyway. So this looks like a worthy pet project that though laudable and impressive will, as one of their neighbours raises at a meeting, not feed the nation. When the vast majority of these complementary farming techniques were in use, the population of the UK was probably less than 10% of what it is now; malnutrition and starvation were rife and distribution methods, without refrigeration, left the food supply subject to the vagaries of the weather. What this doesn't address in any way is just how this method of nurturing the land is going to provide for an hungry population. It's largely presented by Isabella Tree herself, and she is an engaging individual but one who presents the most complex of arguments in far too simple a fashion - as if it were a lecture on the relative merits of organic methods without addressing in any way their limitations of their practicalities or economics. ""Duncan"" the horse and a few of the pigs have some great fun at a charity polo match and it is a very watchable film - but a little too light and fluffy.",False
4,6,A visually stunning British documentary,eddie_baggins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Based on the best selling book by Isabella Tree, who also acts as this features main talking head, British documentary Wilding is a mostly unremarkable exploration of a remarkable work of nature as director David Allen for his debut feature examines the rewilding project of the Knepp Wildland in West Sussex.An estate that is owned by Tree and her partner, the Kneep Wildland project is an entirely fresh way of looking to farm and sustain land outside of the stereotypical fashion that modern science and agribusiness has set in place with an idea to instead let the natural environment and animal species create their own ecosystems from the ground up as man takes a massive backwards step from the whole scenario.It's a controversial approach and one that bought Tree and her team much vitriol and hatred early on in their journey but after decades of sustained practice and a commitment to the cause, the benefits of what their approach can gain is there for all too see, especially with Allen's keen eye.When we say that Wilding is unremarkable as a film it can't be a statement that reads true when one talks about the visual elements of Allen's film that are beautiful and unique in equal measure.Whether its pigs exploring local watering holes for fresh food or deer roaming the estate, Wilding has numerous moments of breath-taking beauty and while the films flashbacks and more staged elements don't real as natural as the modern day segments, even they have their moments, a scene involving 1000's of butterflies descending on the property is gorgeously staged.For anyone seeking out a documentary that connects the viewer directly too nature the way in which is intended to be found Wilding will be a major winner and while it may struggle to find a broad and wide-ranging audience, this is a well-intentioned visual exploration of a true life underdog story.Final Say -A visually outstanding British documentary that never soars to great heights otherwise, Wilding is a workmanlike feature that never outstays its welcome but never becomes a must-see at the same time.3 busy beavers out of 5.",False
5,9,What lies beneath listening to nature,jihadsaade,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think the film invites to dream about a different reality.It doesn't provide the viewers with a complete study on how to shift from commercial farming to permaculture, but, what it gives us is a glimpse of the possibilities that lie beneath this practice and the unlimited wisdom that the earth carry with it.The visuals are beyond beautiful, the directing work, the sound design and music are meticulously crafted .I'm very happy that I got to discover this film in Phoenix Cinema in Leicester and it feels like there is a movement of collective consciousness happening right now that bring back the long lost harmony to our current broken system.",False
6,5,"Heart-warming, but in a one-sided way",euroGary,n/a,16/08/2025,"I attended the world premiere of this documentary in a small but packed cinema during the 2023 London Film Festival. It tells of the efforts of Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree to 'rewild' the former's family farm after many years of intensive agriculture have left the land exhausted.Townie lovers of nature will find much to enjoy here: not only the amusing antics of horses and pigs (the re-enacted escapade of the porkers in a refreshment marquee could have been written by James Herriot); but insects, flowers and tree roots are all amply featured. The camera work is spectacular (what ever did we do before drones?), even if some of the sequences are obviously staged (eg, a harvest mouse running through a drain pipe) or use CGI.But it is what is left out that makes this less a documentary than an unquestioning filmed hymn to Burrell and Tree. Basic information is not given: for instance, how extensive is the rewilding experiment - does it cover all of the farm, or just a small part of it? (And if all the farm is involved, how profitable is it?) Also, in her narration Tree makes a quick reference to the farm's animals being 'managed' - but 'managed' how? In many institutions involving animals, 'managing' them is done with a gun - if that is the case here, why not say so and explain why it is necessary? And what is the purpose to the farm of the camera-friendly animals we see - are they merely decoration, pets, or are they eventually sent for slaughter?Also missing is hardly any expression of differing points of view - essential for creating a balanced piece of non-fiction work. A brief sequence of neighbouring farmers having doubts about the Burrell/Tree experiment sees them dismissed as old-fashioned meanies; their concerns about ragwort - apparently an extremely damaging plant which Burrell and Tree have growing in abundance - are never addressed. And if all the UK were turned over to rewilding, how would that affect our ability to feed a population fast heading toward 70million?So, for all the spectacular camera work, this is pretty much a propaganda piece only. The missed opportunity to counter alternative points of view - leaving the viewer with the impression Burrell, Tree and the film-makers do not have the courage of their convictions, which I admit may be doing them a dis-service - weakens their own argument.",False
7,2,Ecology for airheads,mike-499-205871,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really? A huge estate just left to run wild? And you can afford to let that happen with no visible means of financial support while you breezily dream away your days interspersed with the odd game if polo? Well fine, I suppose, if you have the cash. But it's not really going to help in the long run. The country needs to embrace nature while maintaining a stable food production base. I can't believe I'm saying this, but Clarkeson's farm demonstrates a far more sustainable way of caring for the land of this planet than this sentimental slice of environmentalism lite. Photography was quite nice though.",False
8,1,Modern-day Dilettante Farming,mikekisil,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen the credits rolled I was expecting acknowledgements to Disney, the BBC's fondly-remembered ""Animal Magic"", the Green Party and the uber- conservationist David Attenborough himself but amazingly, none of these made an appearance. The problem with worthy docu-dramas like these, is that you only get glimpses of the true picture because the filmakers and their subjects are out to get a story across but not the real one. This film is a prime example of that type of disingenuous storytelling.Here we have an audience-friendly, photogenic farming family inheriting a farm on its uppers where pater has to make some tough decisions about how a knackered farm is going to provide a living for his family. He gets a local tree-hugging guru to tell him the soil is no good because the oak trees are not ""talking to each other"" because their underground communication links have disintegrated - cue some fancy CGI to show what has happened. So pater decides to sell off all the farming equipment to the local farming community in an emotionally-charged outdoor yard sale overseen by a rustic auctioneer on a day when, of course, it rains. And it's not just a shower but a wandering monsoon. The bit that's missing here is the ""fly-on-the-wall"" conversation with the bank manager or whoever pater has to convince that he has not gone crazy with his idea of how to make his land productive once more. It is the lack of financial information here that is a big hole in the narrative. With Longhorn cattle costing in the £900 region each, Exmoor ponies at £3,000 each , Tamworth pigs at £350 ea and the three types of deer costing between £300 and £750 each (I couldn't find a price for Beavers or Storks on Google) - the intial cost of bringing to the farm the animals chosen, was not chicken feed !Then there was the confrontation with the farmers surrounding the property who were sceptical of the project - their objections were glossed over in a scant four minutes of farmer ""mutter, mutter"", so that quite valid worries were not heard. These pragmatic people who seemed to espouse the view that farmers had the prime duty of feeding the nation and doubtless have had a hard time of it since Brexit and the scaling down of farming subsidies, never really got a chance to air their views before the filmakers went on to the next view of cute wildlife or, gasp, a pair of breeding storks that managed to lay a couple of eggs that hatched two really cuddly storklings - alhough if you watch one dismember a rabbit for dinner, it might not look so cute at all. And we've forgotten the beavers !!What the film really did fail to do is explain in the usual ""end credit"" frame if the estate has been successfully saved. Get on Google and see how much it costs to go on ""nature watch"" tours through the estate, or how much it costs for a stay on the premises as a camper or in Knepp Estate-provided accommodation and you realise that this is less about a ""wilding"" project and more about a unique entry into the hospitality industry that Hilton or Premier Inns have just not thought of. And lets not forget they do a decent business in the sale of venison, beef and pork.",True
9,2,Nonsense,grm-39453,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was disappointed, I expected organic farming. I got some rich couple who sell expensive tours of a estate with some animals running about on it.Not wild boar, of course not, might be a wee bit dangerous?Not wild cattle, but a breed. And regular horses.This is how the world was they claim. Well, explain New Zealand then. Or the Pacific Islands.They also forget most of the people way back when, were not well fed. Animals and plants went extinct even then, they suffered from disease, hunger, climate change, disasters.Right...
Watch bats eat for 70 pounds. Look at butterflies for another 70.""visit wildlife refugia"" it actually says in yep a 4WD vehicle for 110 pounds.What a joke.",False

1,8,"His words, your voice",kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have to admit I was not too aware of August Wilson. But I know I am not alone in that sentiment. Since Denzel Washington decided to give him the voice or rather the platform (on film that is, no offense to all those who've seen the plays) for people to discover his work, that has changed. This is a bit of a behind the scenes look, on people touched by his work.It could be more in depth for sure, but it always can, especially with someone who has put such words onto paper that were and are so helpful to a lot of people. Giving them not just that voice I mentioned (sorry for the pun), but the confidence and the power to be who they are or want to be. This is light entertainment and gives you enough to lift you up. What he already did for others",False

3,10,Fabulous film!!!,ggbcb,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely LOVED Giving Voice, a new documentary about the annual August Wilson Monologue competition and the thousands of high schoolers who enter the competition for the opportunity to perform on Broadway. Some of Wilson's friends started the monologue competition as a way of coping with Wilson's death at age 60 from liver cancer. Yes, I am totally biased as August Wilson is my absolute favorite playwright (ok, maybe he is tied with Shakespeare). I miss live theater madly & this had quite a few clips filmed in actual NYC theaters that I totally know & love and miss.This uplifting, inspiring, & brilliant film had me crying tears of joy more than once. The 6 competition finalists featured were all amazing & I was rooting for each and every one of 'em. And, as an added bonus, 2 of my favorite actors (who I have had the privilege of experiencing perform live), Viola Davis (who also donned an executive producer hat for the film) & hottie Denzel Washington, add some commentary about Wilson, the competition & art in general. Another bonus was some film clips of Wilson himself & his wife explaining the choices he made after learning of his cancer diagnosis. Thumbs way, way, way, way up! Inspirational doc that evidences August Wilson's brilliance & spirit through amazing young actors!",False

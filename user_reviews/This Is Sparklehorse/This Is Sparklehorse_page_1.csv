1,9,Ethereal Genius,edskan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sparklehorse are a band I have loved since I was a teenager. They had a huge impact in my life and through Mark Linkous' songs I really felt it was ok to feel about the world in the way that I do. The imagery he paints through his songs is masterful and they do a good job in this documentary in exploring his life and accomplishments.There are quite a few interviews with people who knew Mark (some more well known than others) and you can tell how much they loved and respected him. The old footage and interviews with Mark are also very insightful. I have watched a few interviews on YouTube about Sparklehorse, but if you're a fan of the band it's definitely worth paying the 6 dollars or so to stream it. I found out a lot more about Mark and feel very blessed to have discovered and connected so deeply with his music.",False

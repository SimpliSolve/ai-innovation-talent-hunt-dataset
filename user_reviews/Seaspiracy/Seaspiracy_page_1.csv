1,9,Shocking,keikoyoshikawa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought this documentary was going to be all about the crimes and unethical conducts by the fishing industry. Instead, the film-makers have also illuminated the various non-profits and advocacy groups that are contributing to the destruction of the oceans through their neglect, obfuscation, or - worse - complicity. And governments, too.This is an eye-opener. And quite depressing at the same time. There doesn't seem to be any good answer or solution, short of reducing consumption. Which in itself doesn't seem to very feasible, given that for many people seafood is an important part of their diet, and global population continues to grow. :(The only sliver of hope is perhaps plant-based seafood products. That, like lab-grown meats, for example, seems to be the only realistic way to achieve sustainability. But, as the film ends with, that depends on all of us making a choice.",False
2,9,Exposing hypocrisy of NGOs,jethrosa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really like the way they expose the hypocrisy of those NGOs. I am always annoyed by those NGOs, especially the ""green"" NGOs, keep telling me ""don't use plastic straws"" kind of minor things yet obviously and intentionally ignore those bigger threats. Moreover those NGOs intentionally mislead people because they are probably funded by the related industries to conceal the real threats. How hypocrite and ironic is the world. This is not a perfect documentary film (maybe too few resources to make a series ), but this is by far the most meaningful documentary delivered by Netflix.",False
3,8,Eye-opening,Neon_Gold,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a scary documentary for a mix of different reasons.It's informative and shocking. The statistics that it gives really make you gasp.You can tell that this film maker really does have a passion for this subject.It's heartbreaking but not really in a way that will make you cry. More in a way that you will be in complete shock and disbelief. At the people who can do things like this.I think the biggest issue I had with the movie is it is trying to fit an insane about of subjects into a documentary that runtime is an hour and twenty nine minutes. It's shoves much in that it has to constantly topic hop. I think it's interesting in a way because it shows how it is all connected but it can just make you feel a little bit untethered to the films I thought.Other than that I think it was great and eye opening.,False
4,10,"I love seafood, it's my most favourite thing, i have to rethink that entirely now",pinky_scotty,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such a great documentary, I wasn't expecting it to be.
Very well made and such great points made. Horrendous impact on sealife.I'm going to cut off seafood entirely from my diet and do my part to save the oceans.",False
5,10,I work for Sea Shepherd so I'm biased...,omartodd,n/a,16/08/2025,"But I do think this is one of the best films about our work and the issues presented I've ever seen. I gave it 10 stars because I think it presented well, stayed on topic and pointed out the things hard to hear but without malice. Great ""first person"" viewpoint too.",False
6,10,Probably the most important documentary out there,smallbeeb,n/a,16/08/2025,"The whole world needs to see this. Now.
The global fishing industry is driving the climate and ecological emergency faster than any other and it is imperative the truth of this is brought to light.
The filmmakers put themselves in very dangerous situations to document this - don't let them down!",False
7,10,Informative and shocking enough,mnilanjan,n/a,16/08/2025,Was surprised by the role of non-profits in this horrendous sea fishing crime. All areas of our lives seem to be riddled by the same issues of greed and fraud,False
8,6,Shock-spiracy,christopherlewisprice,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have to credit the filmmaker for presenting some shocking discoveries about some of the worst excesses of the fishing industry. I will certainly rethink my food habits and be far more mindful of the fishing supply chain when choosing to eat sea food in the future. I hope too that NGOs and regulators take note... Consumers need to be able to make better informed decisions when presented with ""sustainable food"" stickers. We must have clearer definitions of what sustainable means and the regulators must be more transparent.However, I cannot ignore my inner skepticism when I hear stats banded around unsubstantiated. This is shock journalism and one where absolute truth is substituted for the ""story truth."" Cartoon reconstructions of guns firing and images of bloody seas substitute well referenced facts. That jarred for me and meant I spent most part of the film, pausing to fact-check on my phone, or at least view sources to validate claims made in the film. Many of the claims are valid, but some should be taken with a pinch of salt.It is an important documentary and one that will inevitably achieve its ultimate goal, which seems to be recruiting vegans. Whether veganism is in itself a sustainable or realistic long term solution to the problems the film addresses, I believe more evidence is needed.",False
9,10,It's sad that films like this aren't nominated for Best Documentary Oscars! Oh I know why......,MrPositive1,n/a,16/08/2025,"....money talks, just like in the film. If you can seriously eat fish without trying to moderate your consumption after watching this documentary, then you have no heart.",False
10,n/a,It's a good enough doc that you might not eat fish again!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"You may not eat fish again if you watch this passionate Netflix documentary, Seaspiracy, about global corruption, from destroying marine life with plastic garbage to slaughtering whales and dolphins using slave labor. I may exaggerate my tone as director/narrator Ali Tabrizi too often does, but if there is just a small portion of truth here, you best pay attention to see what you can do about our seas.Perhaps the most depressing disclosure is the destruction of marine life and habitats by the growing amount of plastic, which can accumulate in square miles like colonies, seemingly indestructible fake food for unknowing fish like dolphins and whales who ingest without the ability to expunge. To see creatures entangled in monstrous nets as collateral damage is to weep for our inability to stop the imprisonment.As Tabrizi gets closer to Asia, Japan's wanton fishing of sharks for their fins leaves a numbing feeling of waste and cruelty. But crueler still is Thailand's supposed sustainable Grind, an occasional herding of whales resulting in a blood red harbor of death.Yet the bad that men can do is evident as young men corral fish while these youths are themselves enslaved by ruthless employers. Maybe more depressing is Tabrizi's disclosure that non-profit organizations can be more corrupt than whalers.With that human flourish, Tabrizi's 90 min doc makes his point about the universal corruption of humanity and the need to preserve the seas, which need all sizes of fish to sustain itself. Typically, Tabrizi is in hyper mode, but I doubt few of us will give up fish in our diet. His answer to curbing the global exploitation of seas and men can, however, spur us on to better, more humane practices.If seafood disappears, according to a study, by 2048, then most of us will not have to worry. Except for our grandkids, hmmm. I may stop eating fish right now.",False
11,7,A lot of good with just a few questionable choices here and there,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gotta take points off (unfortunately) for the stupid title, the sometimes awkward narration, the occasionally corny writing (""the real
Loch Ness monster"" and ""blood shrimp"" instead of blood diamonds, for example), and the weird/corny animations.Everything else is very compelling though. Knew about over fishing as a problem, but wasn't aware it's as bad as this documentary suggests. Interesting, slickly made, and ultimately very disturbing stuff.",False
12,10,I wish it weren't so...,loonatwok,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was shocking, heartbreaking and very informative. Most of us realize earth is being destroyed by human behavior and then you watch this and it takes it to another level. I had no clue how bad it really is ..... Im glad I now know but wow do I feel hopeless.",False
13,7,I feel like I've seen this before,m68film,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've seen a few feature length docs about our oceans and shark finning, and the plastic gyre, and dolphins in the cove, etc. I actually didn't learn anything new. Be careful when watching documentaries these days, as the filmmaker will conveniently leave counter information out.",False
14,5,Good Intentions but very skewed.,HermanMoore-224455,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe makers heart is in the right place. Ali is a bigger shock jock than Howard Stern. Ali is on his way to Michael Moore status by using fear and extremism to make a point.The point of the film, we as humans need to understand we are ruining the seas, mostly because of over fishing due to severe over population. Bill Burr is right after all ( I will leave it at that)The main point of the film is the oceans will be vacant seas of nothingness by 2048, this is based on a report done in 2006/2008 that was eventually reconsidered in 2009 and to be found inaccurate, this doesn't stop Ali from scaring every numerous celebrities.Ali also claims that 46% of the plastic in the pacific garbage dump is from the fishing industry (fishing nets), however at the end of his comments the viewer is completely confused on the facts of what makes up all of the oceans plastic content, and we humans are given a weird reprieve of the plastic problem we have created. It is all the fault of the darn fishing industry and we can fix it if we stop eating fish. Tell that to the billions who live around the pacific and their primary food source to exist are fish (and other ocean creatures).If you google or watch some YouTube most marine biologists claim 80% of the oceans plastic content is from man, 10% is from fishing industry, not 46%. There is actually such a thing as sustainable fishing, and feel for the editing power of film to make people look like idiots (the many interviews he does).Ali uses hyperbole to sell his film and while the message of the film is from the heart there is a middle ground we can reach.",True
15,10,My first ever review.,laurabethjones,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely heartbreaking and shocking to watch. How can we live in a world where this is normal? Everyone needs to watch this documentary. I knew it was bad, but I didnt realise it was this bad....",False
16,10,FINALLY THE WORLD WILL SEE,sirbarristan,n/a,16/08/2025,"The fishing industry is one of the, if not the most destructive industry on the planet. It has for decades and decades wreaked havoc on the oceans and I just really hope that this documentary goes viral so the world finally will see what eating seafood contributes to! Watch this and Earthlings and you will rethink everything you've been taught to believe about what we eat and how it ""magically"" appears on out plates. Despite the depressing watch I'm more hopeful than ever that the world can change for the better as long as the information spreads wider and wider! Go vegan for a cruelty free world :)",False
17,10,"My ignorance,",bhpsykrgx,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am more environmentally aware and passionate then the average person. But this documentary just opened my eyes!!! Brilliant, tons of information .A must watch !!! There are some stupid reviews questioning the editing etc, this is not meant to be a Hollywood Movie. Information that is easy to digest .",False
18,10,So important,martianmaikel,n/a,16/08/2025,This is one of the most important documentarys today and everyone should watch it.It gives a good look into the criminal systems behind fishing and a really good overview for unterstanding why it is important to save or oceans or to just leave them alone.,False
19,6,Heart breaking,samuelmorley-72620,n/a,16/08/2025,WERE KILLING ARE WORLD THE sea the land were poisoning are planet and it's sucks to know that we're not going to change until it's to late. Money is the cause of all evil.,False
20,10,Bravery and heroism of today to shoot such movie!,kamimontenegro,n/a,16/08/2025,"Respect to the director and his intentions to show the world how money and power lead people to conduct terrible things to living creatures on our only planet, including human beings.It is not easy to get rid of old truths, old habits, old way of thinking and traditions. Now we can no longer pretend that we don't know. Thank you!",False
21,6,A simplified representation of complex relationships.,DLochner,n/a,16/08/2025,"Director Kim Andersen made a name for himself with the films ""Cowspiracy"" and ""What the Health"". In both documentaries, the meat and food industries are accused of conspiracy-like machinations and veganism is propagated as the sole solution for more climate and environmental protection ""Seaspiracy"" is now proceeding in a similar way. The protagonist Ali, played by the director, takes the viewer on what appears to be his own research into the depths of fishing and whaling. The film looks like a YouTube stream Overfishing is a key but not the only factor affecting marine ecosystems That is why the new documentary should be enjoyed with due caution and understood as a food for thought. A simplified representation of complex relationships.",False
22,9,A Must Sea.,bbonneyfilm,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a definite eye opener that will not be easy to digest. If you focus on the information being presented and not the filmmaking, then the film gets the job done. I thought some of the graphics and editing choices (especially the animated re-enactments) cheapened the overall feel.Aside from that, this is another crucial viewing along with the producers other films 'Cowspiracy' and 'What The Health'. We're living in critical times when the consequences of our food choices no longer go unnoticed. You can make a difference simply by what you choose and choose not to eat each and every day.",False
23,6,Good message but mediocre presentation,markmckessock,n/a,16/08/2025,I wholeheartedly agree with the message if this documentary. I think that we truly do need to do something to reduce and reverse the impacts on our oceans. I don't necessarily think we need to stop eating fish entirely but that is beyond the point.I do however have to agree with other reviews stating that the presentation and general journalistic practices used in this film often times border on sensationalism. Its difficult to see someone take a cause you support and use gotcha journalism and non contextualized statistics/infographics to defend it.,False
24,5,"Irritating, ego-pleasing methods",rrtyui,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an advocator for life, and someone with an endless love for sealife, whales and dolphins especially, this documentary irritated me immensely, even though the message was absolutely correct. The guy is not presenting facts in most cases, and simply comes off as what he at one point in the movie critisized; namely a ""feel-gooder"" for lack of a better word.Here are some observations to strengthen this claim:1. The ""interviews"" with companies and people who did not directly agree with him were conducted in a way where he, instead of having a conversation, simply started off by calling them murderers. The phone call to a restaurant at the start of the documentary where instead of going ""Hey, I see that you're using plastic straws, could I make a case for switching to paperbased alternatives?"" he simply says something along the lines of ""You're using plastic straws and are murdering sealife, you monsters"". Of course they're gonna hang up on you, you sound like an agressive, extremist lunatic. All the ""interviews"" with these people made him sound like he WANTED them to ignore him, just so he can say he's the good guy, and they're bad.2. In the case of Dolphin Safe, instead of praising them for being honest, accepting the interview, and doing the best they REALISTICALLY can, he simply bashes them for not meeting his absolute ludicrous, idealistic standards of perfection. He later uses the fact that they can't guarantee no dolphins are killed to insinuate some conspiracy amongst other well-meaning groups.3. Some presented ""facts"" are straight up misleading. Yes, 35 billion are subsidised to fishers. Yes, 30 billion could combat world hunger. But fish is food. Take away those 35 billion and you'd need 65 to combat world hunger.4. At the start of the documentary he's leading us to believe he wants to save the ocean life from plastic pollution and unsustainable fishing, and then does a complete 180 turn once we've started to believe he's being realistic, to stating there is no such thing as sustainable fishing and we should all just stop eating fish because they have feelings. I signed up to watch a documentary about how to save the ocean, not whatever it turned to. Vegan activism? I don't know what to call it.5. He states we should all stop fishing, and talks about how sad it is that west africans can't fish anymore and the sad effects it has animal life on land in the same breath. What? You think if all the fishermen stopped fishing they'd just disappear and not do something else, just like those africans, to make a living?This may have become a bit ranty and hard to understand, I apologize for that.The documentary is still worth a watch, just be prepared for it to be 60% informative, good content and ethical values next to 40% cringey youtube compilation worthy vegan activism.",False
25,9,Great stuff,Leofwine_draca,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA good, well-made documentary from Netflix. I was thoroughly engrossed by SEASPIRACY, particularly the format which draws you in gradually on familiar territory and then ends up wowing you with insider footage and facts and situations you'd never considered before or knew nothing about previously. The narrator/documentarian is a likeable character and his international quest takes him into perilous situations that shed new light on mankind's abuse of the oceans, a crime for which we are all complicit. Great stuff.",True

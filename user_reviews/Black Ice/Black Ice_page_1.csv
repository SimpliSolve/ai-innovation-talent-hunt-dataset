1,6,Its a story I did not realize I wanted to hear and so glad I herd it.,subxerogravity,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a black man who loves Hockey enough that every time a new version of NHL comes out I make a Fantasy New York Rangers team out of every black player, and as a Black man this is a story I'm far too familiar with yet it feels fresh coming from the league that's not the fav of most African Americans, but to hear out loud something Canada would like to sweep under the rug was informative and an important step to eliminating the situation.If you hate racism as much as you hate hockey you should see this movie. Canada's History has as much black history as American History and not surprisingly, hockey is a huge part of that.",False
2,10,message needs to be talked about,novalog44-482-842848,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie is very insightful for people who don't know this history. I'm pretty educated in hockey but I didn't even know of the color hockey league until watching this documentary. Before AMC even stated to view this film it had dozens of 1 star reviews from people in the US. Did they really even see this movie? Probably not. They saw a trailer it upset them because racism is not real and reviewed it one star. I wish there was a way where you had to verify that you actually saw these kind of movies to review. I bet the reviews through AMC are amazing since every time I see a movie it asks me a review whenever I log into the app after seeing the movie. This was a 5/5 film. I really recommend it.,False
3,10,Wonderful story. Amazing message,alanad44,n/a,16/08/2025,"Since getting the amc premiere membership I've been seeing a lot of independent files, documentaries and such. As someone who works in sports this is a topic that is not spoken about but is very apparent even if you don't witness it first hand. Glad this movie is out and I hope people actually watch it instead of just reviewing it one star not even giving it a chanceCopy and pasting because it's not the required characters Since getting the amc premiere membership I've been seeing a lot of independent files, documentaries and such.

1,9,A must watch for everyone who cares for elderly people or will become elderly someday,LilvE,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been following Teun since I heard about him: a young nurse who moved into the closed off area of a care home to live there and experience what life there is really like for people suffering from Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia.I've seen his theatre show about his experience and read his book. This documentary is next level. It shows how other countries care for their elderly, how people suffer from the horrible disease that is dementia but also shows the joy they can still experience. Especially if they can make themselves useful and mean something for someone else. Hearing that 1 in 5 people will get the disease at some point in their life is hard, but it also drives home the fact that we need to be better in organising our care and working together internationally, at prevention as well.I'm not a medical or care professional, just someone who's interested in this subject. I went to see this film with young people who are in nursing school. They found it difficult to watch at times, just as I did. But I think it will help them a lot. And there were a few funny moments in there, too. The only thing I think could have been highlighted more, was that carers everywhere are working very hard and doing their best within the system they need to work in.Teun's story is extremely important and I'm glad it now reaches more and more people. Don't hesitate, go and see it. It will open up your view on people with dementia and life in a care home. It could be you someday.",False

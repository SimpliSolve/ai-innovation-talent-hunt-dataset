1,8,Good ideea for a real purpose.,jxibska,n/a,16/08/2025,"Writter, Producer, Actor Stefan Mandachi, you are trying to hard into letting people see your actions and accomplishments . Even though the movie should be about the cold true fact that Romania has a bad infrastucure whith slow or no real involvement of the government, at some point it feels more like self promotion movie . Or Maybe it was just amateur editing and directing , being ur first. Who knows :) .",False

It's not easy to watch because it hurts, but still it must be seen, because we need to know these things and truth must be told, it must come out. I gave it a 9 because it is not a pleasure to watch, to see how many people die every day in Romania because of the lack of highways, but everything else is awesome executed, good research, exceptional message and I appreciate this man that had the courage to do it and gave his time and money to bring these things to our attention and to try and change something.",False

8,10,Must watch!,ruxanahaisan-42523,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie brings to life the personal tragedies of the victims of car accidents and their loved ones. This is the result of 30 years of bad leadership in Romania's political system!

13,10,A documentary that hurts,madalinadale-99445,n/a,16/08/2025,"A cruel reality especially for us Romanians. Frustration and anger amplifies as we remember that almost each one of us had at least one person we knew involved in a deadly car accident. I was surprised of the insolence the ex prime ministers talked about who it is to blame for the situation Romania is in now.
This documentary is like a reality pill taken on an empty stomach meant to shaken your comfort zone. It can make you despise even more Romanian politicians and their politics. My question at the end of the movie: what can I do to help the situation change?",False

23,10,The sad truth,mateescuandrei-54135,n/a,16/08/2025,"Congratulations Stefan for all of this. Even if all of us know the truth, sometimes is better to have people like you to remind us that we have to fight, not just to live everyday accepting what we have. It is what it is because each one of us accepts the corruption. Maybe we are afraid of doing something but you reminded us that we are not alone. From my point of view, it is not just a movie, it is way more than that, it is the real Romania with all its problems. From politics, to people that are doing nothing to change the life that we have in our country. Thank for everything you did. I am sure that it wasn't easy at all, but in the end, your work is a piece of art.",False

25,10,Speechless,mirceamaghiar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Best romanian documentary i've ever seen. It is such a contemporary drama that should be history by now. So many tragedies could have been avoided only if they, that are supoosed to take care of us, would have just done their jobs.
The other aspects of the movie, the interviews, stories effects and sounds just made it so real. It really touch and awake you especially if you are romanian.
i highly recommend!",False

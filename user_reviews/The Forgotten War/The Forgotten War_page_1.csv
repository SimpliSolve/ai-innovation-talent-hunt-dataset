1,n/a,History for the ignorant,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I assume this is targeted at teens or people who similarly don't yet know much about the world. It says nothing but the obvious (OMG, so obvious) over and over again.
Can be skipped if you have in fact ever read a history of the 20th C.",False
2,9,You need to watch,angie-jacobi,n/a,15/08/2025,"History is repeating itself. Here's a reminder of what happens if you let it. We're at the phase now, where you need to know what will happen if you let it.",False
3,3,Hard to follow,Jack_C_,n/a,15/08/2025,"With dozens of awesome WWII movies to copy from, The Forgotten War somehow manages to completely lose this viewer's interest. The plot is incoherent and random nameless characters are just thrown in the first 30 minutes. You never gain emotional connection with anyone.I had more fun writing this review than watching it. Don't waste your time.",False

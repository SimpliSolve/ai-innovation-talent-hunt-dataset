1,9,Stunning but a strong point underplayed,gs-53802,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this with feelings of awe, fear and that captivating feel you inly get from underwater cinematography.However.It missed the emphasis of the final message.A true act of limits and daring, for sure, but the emphasis of how dangerous Allessia is, to herself and her safety crew was wholly diluted.Portrayed as a heroine.What she did was selfish, I felt no element of compassion or others safety.I was left feeling that he passed purely down to her own actions and nothing more.He clearly had very strong feelings which impaired his actions, ibfelt she did nothing to try to help him and only focused on her achievements.Such a sad loss.",True
2,7,"Well made, extraordinary story, but...",mybeat,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAbsolutely extraordinary story and well done documentary from a filmmaking stand point mixed with amazing music and underwater footage! A Homage to life. And also a deeper meaning on how people are desperately looking for a purpose/meaning of life and just wanna be seen, connected, acknowledged and loved. I dont want to spoil anything, but all i can say is: If you always play with fire you will eventually get burned! So this is the risk you are and must always be aware of!For me personally this sport is insane and these people in my opinion are looking in the wrong places to feel alive and special!Is a world record worth your life if you know hundreds of people died doing this..?!So unfortunately the films ending didnt have the impact it should have for me.. But it seems for others it does.. I just dont understand... Its still a great documentary.But i just can't wrap my head around, why someone on earth would risk his life everyday, just to have a world record!?",True
3,8,"""How can one person touch so many?""",kawtharffathalla,n/a,16/08/2025,"I often find myself deeply fascinated by people's passions, at the same time it sometimes frightens me the idea of how the obsession with passion can possibly be the end of you literally and figuratively. What does it really take to go after your passion? And how willing are you to sacrifice for it?I watched this documentary without any knowledge of freediving or the story and it immediately grabbed my attention right from the opening scene, that itself kept me on the edgeIt's such an interesting element of the story structure how stunning they capture the concept to be as an extreme sport, yet how dangerous of an endeavor it actually is. It shows you both sides of the athlete's obsession about it and the lengths they go for it, which leaves you questioning wanting to understand the depths of satisfaction beyond passion given their lives are at dangerous risks knowingly.The cinematography was stunning, incredible archival footage! It takes you through the diver's journeys from top to underwater beautifully it's sometimes scary. The interviews were heartfelt and informative enough for you to understand a bit of the extreme sport, while at the same time, it maintained sensations and delivered emotionally making you feel for the tragedy and how their story intertwined in destiny.",False
4,10,AMAZING,jeilaleila,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow this movie has to be the most heart touching, movies I have encountered in such a long time! Oh my goodness this documentary was just beautiful! I know im not the only who cried. I do not think I have ever cried to a documentary before, but i can down right tell you, this one is the first. Down to the pictures, the recorded footage, the recorded audio, actal people who were really there to experience every minute of the journey that took place, was just astonishing. I love how the timeline of the story was at a steady pace. It wasnt a drag nor did not seemed to leave any important parts out. It told a beautiful story. Just AMAZING!",False
5,10,Simply Profound in Everyway,d-papadakis,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHaving halfway expecting a dry documentary about free diving, a much less interesting take on it than the old movie ""The Big Blue""; boy was I wrong.No spoilers, just if you watch it you will love every minute. The story, cinematography, the commentary, and the music weave together to pull you totally in. And for sure you will be sobbing at the end but the whole presentation has foreboding but beautiful mood so that doesn't count as a spoiler.For me however, I don't think I have every heard spoken a more precise and deep description of what loss is. This is spoken at the end of the movie by the father of one of the main characters. And it is nothing less than profound in its insightfulness and understanding about how human beings feel about loss. That is if you are smart enough to put it into words, and these words really moved me. I will always remember them.",True
6,7,Beautiful and annoying at the same time,Ramdapanda,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSome might find the setup of the documentary interesting and heart tugging from a story perspective, for me it was needless. I'd much prefer being straight to the point and focusing on the relationships and journeys of the characters rather than it being a mystery and ""ohh you have to watch to the end to find out"" sort of storytelling in documentaries.With that said, it is beautifully shot and it gives an insight, albeit dark one into the sport of freediving.SPOILERS BELOW - (not relevant to scoring)Others have mentioned the arrogance of Alessia with some even blaming her for the death of Stephen. For me, it was a needless death caused by really poor safety planning.How were they able to plan for several weeks without ever thinking of having a scuba diver follow Alessia through the tunnel and make sure she gets to the rope?Or even more simple, put a bright light on the rope so you can see it.Or have a backup plan if Stephen wasn't ready in time.Personally, documentaries like this, where people have died needlessly for the lack of very basic safety precautions (another example being 100 foot wave) frustrates me to no end.",True
7,10,Best Documentary since Free Solo,kevin-rixon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beautiful and profound and a celebration of love and life and living. It gripped me as much as Free Solo did in its edge of seat drama and tension. So cleverly structured and paced. I could sense its foreboding nature throughout but still could not anticipate the final heart wrenching outcome. Emotional and beautiful storytelling. Thank you for sharing this very personal story set against a beautiful score. I could not look away for a second and was transported into this unknown world, not experienced since The Big Blue. If you loved that film, this one will stay with you too. I will carry this story with me for a long time. Bravo!",False
8,6,Good documentary of a pointless sport,kvsider,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFree diving is probably the most pointless sport I've come across so there is a huge merit in making a documentary about it which is this watchable.During this docco, we see divers putting themselves in danger and putting the safety divers in danger all the time.Among all, Alessia is the most dislikable character as she selfishly and routinely puts herself in danger doing these dangerous dives knowing full well she wasn't prepared for it.At the same time, her charismatic boyfriend loved by all the community is portrayed as this life saving angel who would give his life to safe someone else.The doc reaches its pinnacle when in one of this expected accidents, he dies saving her. Tragic as it is that a great guy lost his life it's difficult to feel sympathy for this people and their sport .",True
9,9,Intense in every way,gusffern,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched this.I'm not a freediver, but as a rescue diver, I found this beautiful and intense, and I understand the feelings that moved Alessia and Stephen and many of the comments they made.Also having been to Dahab, I know how beautiful, but also how dangerous it can be.But I don't think you need to do any diving or love the sea at all to enjoy this story of living the moment and pushing your limits. At times stunning, at times anxiety-inducing, it's beautifully edited and it's a great story of two people finding their calling AND finding each other.I ended the movie with a few tears and an even deeper appreciation for ""carpe diem"" and for the beauty of (and respect for) the ocean.I strongly recommend it.",False
10,7,Insightful Documentary about Freediving,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not A24's best film but it's still pretty good.It's an interesting documentary about freediver Alessia Zecchini and
Stephen Keenan on the goals, life, accomplishments and challenges they processes throughout her career with good insightful discussions and some gorgeous camerawork. Director Laura McGann does a pretty good job on capturing the career of Zecchini and maintaining the documentary's tone without feeling sloppy. The camerawork of the underwater sequences were absolutely gorgeous and beautiful. Documentaries about ocean life I always love because of the gorgeous production and shot compositions provided and The Deepest Breath does have some wonderful underwater scenes.Throughout, there were some really good editing and emotional moments that were genuinely interesting and touching. The conversations between participants were insightful but admittedly there were a few discussion moments that felt a little dragged on. The soundtrack choices felt a little cheesy and some pacing could have improved. Overall, it's a pretty good documentary.",False
11,10,Heartbreaking masterpiece,bartulbuselic-54834,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe scene where her boyfriend sets her in only position she can survive,knowing its last thing he will do on this Earth,he chose her,not himself..
Its the most heartbreaking,beautiful,scariest,deepest scene i have ever seen in any documentary,this movie will stay with me for a while...The diving is so scary but i trust them when they say its the most beautiful thing in their life,they say its like fyling,so how can we even imagine what it feels like to be 100 metes below surface in pitch blackneww,nothingness it must be the most terryfing and most beautiful thing one human can expirience,10/10.",True
12,7,Interesting,marianneczka,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerReally good documentary. Gripping, interesting visuals, good tension, intriguing topic that isn't much explored etc. But plays a little bit too much on human emotion. The interviews with family members are a bit too emotional in my opinion.I also disliked the fact that even though the main protagonist (the male diver) loses his life to save the girl, she still goes onto establishing more diving records. I find it simply disrespectful towards him.This should've been an eye opener for her and she should value her life more. I agree with another reviewer, I just cannot comprehend them wanting to lose their lives for a medal/ the beat a record.Maybe it's in human nature to be this competitive, but how does an extreme sport include a person fainting or ""blacking out"" a lot of the times still considered normal and something to continue pursuing.I feel bad for the families and close ones, that they have to suffer just because of the stubborn nature of the divers.",True
13,4,This documentary is a charade,Geekofriendly,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDISCLAIMER: Until recently, I used to be a very active freediver, an occasional safety diver and instructor. I am familiar with the tragedy that happened at Dahab.I forgot why I really, REALLY dislike Alessia Zecchini. Actually, I can't stand her. My entire body sounds off major alarms I can only interpret as intuition: ""This woman is bad news!""This documentary reminded me why. She's a head-strong brat who was so reckless as a freediver that it was bound she'd get someone killed. That just happened to be her good friend/coach/boyfriend Stephen Keenan. And now she's made a poor man's guilt-trip documentary that wants to pay homage to the man who saved her life by sacrificing his, but still somehow winds up focusing mostly on her and her freediving journey.The VERY FIRST scene is Alessia having a blackout right before surfacing from a deep dive. As a fellow freediver, I was deeply appaled and offended by this directorial decision, because it would be like a documentary about Ferrari that opens with a major car crash.Blackouts are not as common a thing at freediving competitions as this documentary would lead you to believe. And especially underwater blackouts are something that should be avoided at all costs! Responsible, capable, and upstanding freedivers know where their limit is and prepare beforehand so they do NOT put themselves and their safety divers at unnecessary risk. Alessia Zecchini is NOT one of those freedivers. So if the documentary wanted to portray the potential dangers of competitive freediving, Alessia Zecchini is one of the last (if not THE LAST) freedivers to talk.The Vertical Blue competition where Alessia had 3 blackouts one after the other was one of the most irresponsible things I've ever seen a freediver do at a competition. Putting herself in danger is one thing, but being so selfish to put her own petty goals over the safety of the safety crew is disgraceful. And a reckless, truly dangerous decision done in the utmost poorest of taste.I don't think Alessia feels her share of the responsibility for Stephen's death. I didn't think she did after the accident happened and - after seeing this documentary - I still don't think she does. But I think she should.""The Deepest Breath"" is a disjointed documentary about competitive freediving à la Alessia Zecchini that tries to whitewash the fact that Alessia's approach to life was/perhaps still is to put herself and her ambitions first and disregard others. I'm truly sorry if I misjudged and miss-stepped, but I found way too many parts of ""The Deepest Breath"" a despickable, self-indulgent charade.4 stars because the documentary does want to head into the right direction, at times with surprising candor. But it falls way short.",True
14,10,"Impressed, but bitter",gptdmjxx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Captivating storytelling. The filming technique was spectacular. What impressed me most was how the mass collection of varying sources were orchestrated so seamlessly. After watching, my immediate reaction was of bitterness towards Alessia Zecchini. My interpretation of how the movie portrayed her was as an immature, selfish, attention-seeking person. It was disappointing for me not to hear her say she loved Stephen Keenan. I unfairly judged her based on my skewed perception of her portrayal. Even if I had been there, I have no right to judge. The guilt she felt must have been gutting to say the least. I sincerely hope others are kind to her and don't perceive the character she was portrayed as the way I did.",False
15,10,Phenomenal story 10/10,pabsryan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerContrary to a 2/10 review I have just seen. Stephen was definitely not an 'idiot' but a hero in every sense. He had a decision to make....life or death to save another and he chose death. It's very easy to sit behind your keyboard and say I would have done different but you'll never know until in that moment.It is a beautifully told story, incredibly emotional and pulls at the heart strings. For those who have never watched deep diving like this before, the athletes who do it have all of my respect. The bravery, courage, focus and discipline it takes is on another level. At any point it can all end for them but they do it anyway.",True
16,n/a,Disappointing,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's much to love about free diving, but you won't find it in this film. The subjects have so much ego, are so competitive and goal-oriented that they degrade what coule be an art, or even a spiritual practice, into just another dumb extreme sport.The only people with an iota of self-reflection or wisdom are the characters fathers, which is kind of suprising considering how free diving can be a transcendental experience.The sea is just a backdrop for their ambitions and awards. No mention of the physiology of freediving, the the cultures in which it is tradtionally practiced, the stunning (and threatened) marine environments where they dive. It might as well be a documentary about tennis or golf.",False
17,7,The tragedy of obsession,glenaobrien,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had never even heard of the sport of free diving before watching this documentary. The idea is to see how deep you can dive on a single breath. From childhood, Italian diver, Alessia Zecchini is obsessed with the sport and with chasing the world record dive. Restless Irish adventurer, Stephen Keenan becomes a renowned safety diver in Dahab, Egypt. The two meet during a competition there and develop a romantic relationship. They attempt to dive the notorious Blue Hole which has already taken many lives. The film makes it clear that there will be a tragedy but cleverly holds off on the nature of it until near the end which adds a nice element of suspense and surprise.In some ways the film is a portrait of the tragedy that obsession can bring. Watching the divers black out due to the loss of oxygen to the brain only to be revived again for another attempt leaves you wondering why people would put themselves through it and how free diving can be seen as a legitimate sport with such evident risk involved. Writer, director, and cinematographer Laura McGann (who covered roller derby in the 2016 documentary Revolutions) skilfully weaves together a compelling portrait of the human need to push oneself to (and beyond) the limits of physical endurance. She also highlights the deep personal connections among the competitors, judges, trainers, and safety divers for whom the deepest breath is only a moment away from the last breath.",False
18,10,Heartbreakingly beautiful,orlamartin-88166,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWOW. A beautifully made documentary, I was enthralled from beginning to end. I didn't know much about free driving before watching and was blown away by the courage, passion and bravery exhibited by the free divers in their pursuits for record titles.The story weaves us into the lives of Stephen and Alessia, who, I felt were destined to cross paths. I sensed the foreboding nature of the documentary but was not ready for how it played out. A lot of tears. That last photo of Stephen and Alessia is something that will stay with me for a long time. A truly heroic act.Go and watch this but have tissues.",True
19,10,"A wonderful story of achievement, life, love, friendship and selflessness.",feiticeir,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like one reviewer already posted, if you liked Free Solo, you will love this.A wonderful story of achievement, life, love, friendship and selflessness that also includes the sport of free diving.We are taken in personal story(ies) about free diving, the dangers and the rewards of such an extreme sport.What it takes to beat and set world records.The love for the sport it clearly shows, as the love for the the sea and adventure.At certain point you can guess where it leads, but you are not going to discover how until the very end.I couldn't look away. I was hooked. At certain point, I was feeling empathy and my heart was beating slowly, like I was holding my breath.I love this kind of documentaries. The personal stories, the home videos, the intimacy we start to feel.In my opinion, it is well written and directed. All the things appear are at the precise time.What it means to be selfless and a hero.What a wonderful story ! Thank you.",False
20,9,What it means to have the deepest love...,CouchTV,n/a,16/08/2025,"This emotional documentary film dives deep, not only into the ocean, but also deep into our souls.What does it mean to have the deepest kind of love? This film covers it in many ways, through real characters.For a parent who deeply loves a child, it may be to set a child free to discover his/her true passions in life.For any person who tries to find deep meaning in life, you may feel lost many times before you find your true calling.For those of us who have experienced deep love, we are moved by the sacrifice and selflessness that has been given to us.Searching for our deepest love, finding it, enjoying it, losing it...this film helps us understand the triumphs and tragedies of life, and in the end, hope. Because when you see the deepest kind of love, it's a celebration of the best aspects of humanity.Another documentary, The Rescue (2021, National Geographic), evokes similar feelings and emotions.The whole team that participated in this documentary, including the director, editor, music as well as all the real people...thank you for making this.",False
21,5,Poor structure & dislikeable lead,prasadgollakota,n/a,16/08/2025,"Where to begin. First, the biggest structural mistake in a documentary is to treat the audience as stupid. This documentary does that tremendously well. 10/10 for that.It frames everything with a build up to a climax, only to bait and switch the climax on the assumption you dont know the story or you wouldnt look it up prior to watching. In this day and age its a cardinal sin to assume this. Its also why a documentary like Senna is one of the greats. Kapadia doesnt assume the audience is stupid and everyone knows the end, so its more about the journey. Here, its as though youre taken on one journey only to fall down a ""lets pretend secret"" trapdoor. 0/10.Second main flaw is the main character isnt very likeable and that seems to be the case from start to finish. 0/10.Otherwise it was well made. This is where the 5 marks came from.Ps. What an utterly stupid activity.",False
22,10,"Breathtakingly shot, edited, & scored. The best HEARTBREAK.",icaremore,n/a,16/08/2025,Moved me in an uncommon way and I've been a paramedic since 2001. It's an amazing journey and I can't say enough for the production & direction. This was done in a way honoring all involved. Perfect. Simply perfect. I'm a documentary fan and love learning about others lives & what's out there. What shocked me is how incredible this material was put together and to tell this tale of love & loss. But yet unimaginable hope & love permeates the film. All I can say is they got it right. And that happens less often theses days. It's worth the time & them sum. I already want to rewatch it with my daughter.,False
23,10,Left breathless,Kkearns5282,n/a,16/08/2025,A beautiful story about living life's passions and for some those passions come with great risk. It's not for us to judge their decision to undertake such a risky sport but to recognize this is what for some give them a true appreciation of life itself.There is a budding love story cut far too short but I think will echo in the hearts and minds of the people who bore witness to it and an act of unconditional love and self sacrifice that is beautiful in its tragedy.As the film reaches its conclusion I truly felt short of breath as you know something tragic is impending and there is nothing you can do but wait for it. It's not an easy film to watch but an important one.,False
24,10,A profound journey into the Abyss,prolead,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWith its compelling fusion of human endurance, and visual spectacle, ""The Deepest Breath"" delivers a tour de force in documentary filmmaking. This transformative exploration of the world beneath the ocean's surface deftly chronicles the thrill and danger associated with extreme deep-sea diving.The documentary skilfully guides us with precision and sincerity, immersing us not just in the turquoise depths of the sea but also in the hearts of those brave enough to traverse its depths. It balances fact-finding, personal narratives, and thrilling footage seamlessly, creating a visual treat and an intellectual journey. Each frame is a stunning palette of bioluminescent blues, effervescent greens, and shades of black that manage to be simultaneously ominous and serene.Keenan and Zecchini's personal stories humanize the adventure, painting a vivid portrait of their courage, dedication, and almost mystical connection to the ocean. The soundtrack complements the narrative arc flawlessly, intensifying the emotional experience for viewers.The end is a combination of success and failure depending on whose point of view you take. Keenan would see it as success because he saved Zecchini from almost certain death and while Zecchini survived the ordeal after completing her dive would have taken in at as a failure because she lost Keenan to the deep.The deep blue waters claimed its son. Keenan rests in peace.",True
25,10,A Love Story,ravenclaw_girlrules,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI love extreme sport documentaries. It is worth noting that this documentary is less an encapsulation of the entire free diving sport, and more of a love story between a free diver and her safety.The sheer amount of footage made this documentary extremely exciting. While free diving at this level is not something everyone can understand from a risk perspective - setting records is human nature. Attempting to beat records gives people a sense of purpose.I actually think this one could've been a bit longer - but I understand from a love story perspective why the story 'ended' in the tragedy. I would like to know why Steve waited ~20 seconds to go down. I'm happy there was no 'blame' shifted to Alessia for missing the rope/being pulled off course.",True

1,10,Transformative and cathartic,mozet_tre,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film had a profound impact on me. Unlike so many other climate change related films of our time that load us up with facts, or try to scare us with the impacts we know are coming, or try to make us feel good about the solutions we have to combat it, this film offers a much more cathartic and nourishing approach. By facing up to grief head on and treating it so carefully and respectfully, the film leaves us with something that lingers, and in a way helps to heal and give us energy to move forward. A must see for anyone worried about climate change, or too scared to face up to it.",False

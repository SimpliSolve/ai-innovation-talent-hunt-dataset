1,5,typical fund raising film posing as a documentary,howboutthisone_huh,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a documentary, I can't give this one star but if it was just about the topic, I would because it's completely off based to reality. Come and live in my world for a time and you can see for yourself the effect of illegal immigration. You won't see a comfortable two story house in houston suburb though. Production wise it seems quite a bit of effort went into producing a professional film but for what purpose. People go missing at alarming rate in the US because we allow a great deal of freedom of movement. Many consider that their human right but where does the right of the individual end where the community begins. So what does that have to do with missing persons? It's simple, the people found there shouldn't be there any more than I don't go hiking in the hills of wyoming. What the film shows is that a tremendous amount of resources are expended on people who make a poor choice and end up suffering for it. It doesn't matter who pays for it but if I went hiking, died, the media wouldn't write about it but I, or my estate would have to pay for my foolishness. And if I was dumb enough to make it difficult to identify my body, no one would probably know because I've never heard of any case where any effort is made comparable to what I see in the film. It doesn't matter who pays for this effort but all these resources could have been expended on another mission that would have had more impact and maybe prevent these deaths. Such as, prosecuting those making money off this human trafficking. Such as educating people about the dangers. Such as cutting off the resources on the US side from helping them. Such as making it illegal to help anyone who crosses illegally especially in areas like this. Such as creating stiff penalties for anyone providing employment or any assistance that allows them to stay in the US. I have met quite a few people here illegally but I've never met anyone who came here without help. I've never met anyone who didn't have help on the other side too. My sympathy goes out to all the families with missing family members but I won't be donating to this cause or condoning what they are doing.",False

1,6,"Great performance, but...",englishsid,n/a,16/08/2025,"Who edited this?Having seen the live performance of this show, I find the edit here disappointing and disjointed. It lacks the natural flow and energy of the original, making it hard to follow the actual story being told. Key moments, like the entire early days in London section, have been completely skipped, and the setlist feels jumbled and out of order. These choices seriously impact the coherence of the narrative.That said, the music itself is still stellar, Bono and the Jacknife Lee Ensemble deliver powerful and dynamic performances that truly shine throughout.Just a shame the story is actually lost.",False
2,7,Interesting concert documentary about Bono,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Andrew Dominik's portray of Bono during his one-man music show ""Stories of Surrender: An Evening of Words, Music and Some Mischief"" is an electric, flashing and interesting examination about the polarizing yet talented musician Bono. Using musical performances basing his memoir and his personal connections, Dominik offers what Bono is telling to the audience. His passion, his growing up years, his beliefs, and what makes him special.The camerawork, direction and the atmosphere of how this documentary is used is well structured. Interlacing with good musical performances from Bono. What succeeds about this documentary is that even if you aren't a fan of Bono, his delivery and words draws you in. His poetic-like personality and music flows a personal journey into the minds and offering a unique experience.I won't say I am a U2 or Bono fan but I found myself being intrigued watching this. Overall, a good documentary.",False
3,6,Beautiful. Pretentious.,mos7ro,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love U2, my favourite band for long time, but I have been developing an (I don't know how else to call it) rejection towards Bono that is growing more and more with time. This a very beautiful pice, only surpassed by its ego driven and pretentious story. Bono is too self-righteous, the authenticity he tries to force while telling this story end up being -ironically- a little overacted. Still a great singer, still great composer and I don't doubt he is a good person with good intentions, but this comes across... he is coming across more and more as the years pass, as fake. Interestingly he does mention at the beginning this can come in that way, self-centered, but that warning doesn't save it from being what it indeed is, a pretentious piece.",False
4,10,A Surrender That Touches the Soul,ckycr,n/a,16/08/2025,"In Stories of Surrender, Bono achieves something truly extraordinary: he strips away the myth, the stadium, the noise - and stands alone with his story, his music, and his vulnerability. What unfolds isn't just a play or an intimate concert; it's an emotional surrender - honest, devastating, and deeply human.As a viewer, you don't see the U2 frontman. You see the son who lost his mother, the friend who loves his bandmates with quiet devotion, the man searching for meaning in the chaos of a life lived out loud. The theatricality is there - because art demands it - but there's no empty spectacle. Every gesture, every reimagined note, serves a truth that aches and embraces.What's most powerful is that, though ego is inevitable for any artist, Bono doesn't hide behind it. He channels it to open up, to move, to make you cry if you need to. And I needed to.Stories of Surrender is not about understanding Bono. It's about understanding ourselves through him.",False
5,7,Bono will not be held back!,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Bono: Stories of Surrender"" (2025 release; 86 min.) opens, Bono is telling the audience about his heart problem around Christmas 2016, which leads him to bring a highly reworked ""Vertigo"". Bono then goes back in time, to what things were like growing up in Ireland between himself and his dad. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is directed by Australian director Andrew Dominik (""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford). First there was the book ""Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story"", then the book tour, then the New York one man show ""Stories of Surrender: An Evening of Words, Music and Some Mischief..."". And now we get the film version of the one man shows, taped at the Beacon Theater in New York. Please note that I did not read the memoir, or catch the book tour, or see the one man show, so I watched this documentary as a stand-alone. It is important to understand that this is not a traditional Bono bio-pic. Instead it is Bono reflecting on his life and work. Check out the Pavarotti stories he shares with his dad (Bono playing both himself and his dad). This also is very much a Performance, not some off the cuff remarks. I quite enjoyed it for what it was, nothing more, nothing less. Bono is now in his mid-60's and brimming with energy. He will not be held back! The U2 songs that Bono performs (backed by some strings and drums) are all heavily reworked. But in the end this is quite enjoyable, and with a running time of not even an hour and a half, this flew by in no time. Please note that Brad Pitt is a co-producer.""Bono - Stories of Surrender"" premiered at the Cannes film festival a few weeks ago, and now is streaming on Apple TV. It is currently rated 71% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, which sounds about right to me. If you are a fan of Bono or of U2, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
6,10,Astounding exposure of vulnerability,scb05,n/a,16/08/2025,"I understand the 7min standing ovation at Cannes.U2 fan, or not, to expose oneself to the demons and desires on stage, confess your need for parental acceptance and approval, and to realize, our parent(s) are not immune to this life's challenges in it's short tenure, takes a brave heart for the average person.Bono exposes himself full throttle, through stories of his youth and the band, his marriage, becoming a father, and his struggles of losing his mother and seeking approval from his father- and how all that has driven his desire to make music.Everyone shares his story in their own way,
but he makes sharing that story ok.I have never given 10/10 but it is right for here.Listen to his story- embrace your own.",False
7,7,Almost A Masterpiece,carlcasso,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ok first things first .I'm Irish but I've never been a huge fan of U2 or Bono.I don't mind their music but I've never bought a U2 album or gone to a U2 Gig.I was expecting much from this film.To be brutally honest I was going to switch it off after the first few minutes .I've now idea why Andrew Dominick allowed such a pretentious egotistical into to the show .Having said that , from what I know of Bono he probably gave Andrew little say as to what way it was going to start.I advise any future viewers to skip past the pretentious start and get straight into the show .It's actually really good and very entertaining .He uses U2's music to create a story and does the songs proud .I really enjoyed it and would recommend watching it to anyone whether a fan or not .Well done Bono.I'm sure it took a lot of balls to put this out.It worked .",False
8,10,A 25% of U2 is better than your Swift,danielperdomot,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bono's Stories of Surrender is not just a documentary - it's a masterclass in artistry, authenticity, and emotional depth. In an era dominated by flashy spectacle and often superficial lyricism, this intimate journey with a quarter of U2 reminds us what real storytelling looks like.Through his spoken word, stripped-down performances, and candid reflections, Bono proves that experience, vulnerability, and soul still matter in music. He doesn't rely on trends or gimmicks - he relies on truth, and that makes all the difference.This show effortlessly eclipses what many of today's top-charting artists offer. Unlike Taylor Swift's meticulously marketed personas or Drake's algorithm-friendly sound, Bono invites us into something far more enduring: a life lived through art, love, conflict, and purpose. Stories of Surrender is proof that depth will always outshine hype.If you're tired of the music industry's noise and hungry for something real, meaningful, and deeply human - this documentary is a must-watch. Bono's voice may be weathered, but it carries the weight of history, heartache, and hope like few others can.",False
9,6,Chaotic & Compelling,statchmo-317-162086,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't overly impressed with Bono's book, upon which this is based. Frankly it was mostly boring with occasional moments of inspired writing. Too occasional. So I wasn't sure I was going to watch the film, but the trailer was compelling enough that I sat down to watch.On the upside, I watched the whole thing, and didn't get bored.On the downside, much like the book, I found the film to be chaotic, fragmented, and hard to follow.And yes, sometimes self-indulgent. Sorry Bono.I actually liked the re-workings of the songs musically, but found the changed lyrics jarring at times.I think if you're a U2 or Bono fan, this is a must-see. The best bits for me were the conversations with his father, with Bono playing both roles. The Pavarotti impression was pretty fun too.It does take a pretty healthy ego to indulge in a project like this, but Bono has never shied away from that aspect of his personality. After all, it's almost required to be a (short) rock star.Watch it and see what you think.",False
10,5,Stories of Pretender,An-Read,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bono and U2 released The Joshua Tree with Bullet the Blue Sky on it in 1987. The song had to do with El Salvador and was a musically and lyrically compelling statement turning the spotlight on US military intervention and its consequences for the people there. It was also a reflection on ordinary people -- especially Christians -- in America and their support for what would be considered war crimes in any other÷way-around situation. Over a quarter of a century later, it took the same Bono about 20 months of wholesale live-streamed murder of civilians and 5,000 children aged five and under killed to open his mouth about Gaza and deliver one of the most disingenuous utterances possible...That's pretty much all one needs to know to see this high-end cinematic depiction of a relatable version of Bono neatly interspersed for authenticity with lower-key moments for what it is. At some point on stage, our rock star takes a glass of beer and turns it upside down so that it's revealed to be a prop. ""Show business"", Bono says. Which inadvertently becomes the perfect visual summary for his perfectly staged exercise in sincerity. Now, don't get it wrong. It's not that some of those personal stories told in the film couldn't be interesting and actually relatable. And we'll get back to them in due course. It's not that the work doesn't feature some moderately interesting technical ideas and creative choices. It's just that when someone attains such sky-high levels of hypocrisy as our glorious ""quater-man"" storyteller, nothing they say can really be taken seriously anymore. So, instead of discussing the technicalities -- which will be properly done by many others anyway -- let's try a little substance oriented tangent here...Let's give Mr Hewson the benefit of the doubt. Let's try to see him how he'd like to be seen. As a humanitarian, as a speaker for the poor and oppressed, as a spiritual seeker (I'm sorry but, given the band's output over the course of two and a half decades, trying to see him as an interesting musician would hardly be possible today even as an abstract thought experiment). OK, what was the great Marcus Aurelius' main rule? ""Look things in the face and know them for what they are?"" It totally makes sense, doesn't it? So let's do it...How many wars of choice aka illegal military interventions in other sovereign nations mostly composed of direct violatios of international law and oftentimes outright war crimes started by Western powers in this century was our humanitarian vocal about? There's been no shortage of those lately. Did he have anything to say about the invasion in Iraq, for example? Or the destruction of Libya? All of them proved to be illegal actions in pursuit of hidden agendas based on lies and fabrications -- which was kind of evident from the get-go -- and resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths and pretty much complete destruction of civilian infrastructures of entire regions. Sadly, none of them were of much concern to Bono. Nor did he have a lot to say about the genocide in Yemen or thousands of Palestinians killed even before the ongoing slaughter. He was too busy making friends with the George W. Bush and Madeleine Albright types who probably see Agent Orange in their wet dreams. So much for our great humanitarian and man of peace...A speaker for the poor and working folks? Has Bono been spotted once near the real deals like Chris Smalls? Or Chris Hedges? Kshama Sawant? Any union rank-and-file? Actually helping actual people to actually organize so that they could have a chance to stand up for their rights, for their right to simply survive? Meaning as opposed to be thrown an occasional bone through the efforts of some golden hearted philanthropist? Not really. Bono was too busy dicking around the WEF types who probably see unionizing in their nightmares. And that's when he wasn't devising another clever tax evading scheme. Or referring to the wild idea of properly paying said taxes in his homeland to ensure that those less fortunate have some semblance of social safety nets in place along the lines of ""if you are rich, it doesn't mean you should be stupid"". So much for our working-class hero...Everyone knows Bono's dictum, ""We work with everybody"". Well, first, this ""everybody"" seems to be weirdly selective and manifesting an obvious elitist slant. And second, how's it going? What are the practical outcomes of Bono's cozying up to every major oligarch and war criminal on the planet? Releasing the Collateral Murder video by WikiLeaks in 2010 became a resonant event, was covered by major mainstream media outlets, and produced serious consequences. Dozens of even more horrible videos involving children and coming in from Gaza on a daily basis produced 52 standing ovations with which one of the main perpetrators of those crimes was welcomed on the floor of the Congress by Bono's partners in making the world a better place. So how is this approach working out? ...For the sake of brevity, we aren't even going to start on spiritual seeking. Rather, let's get back to the film. Given everything mentioned above, one question is likely to haunt you if you choose to watch it. In this situation, in this world of today with all those things happening as business as usual, doesn't someone of Bono's stature (no pun intended) with all their financial independence, creative freedom, platform (no pun...really), army of followers as well as knowledge and experience have any other topic to focus on apart from...Themselves -- like as in Bono, not God? Again, don't get it wrong. If we were talking about some sort of reclusive artist carefully eschewing any social contexts, we could opine on their general outlook but such a choice on their part should be deemed natural. Talking about someone who has spent decades presenting themselves as the greatest social activist on this planet, however... No tales to tell except those that the fans already know and everyone else ain't necessarily that interested in? No events that happened or unfolding to draw attention to? No other person or their work to highlight? No subject to delve into? Now? In that position? If you do care? Come on...So, long story short, the film may be expected to polarize the audience. Those who comprise the fanbase, still consider what U2 has been releasing for more than 25 years real music and are prepared to take anything its frontman has to offer at face value will probably see it as a stylishly arranged, maybe a bit redundant but still interesting, portrayal of Bono's introspective self bringing up his childhood, relationships with his parents, and the origins of the band. And may totally enjoy themselves. But those who tend to have a hard time trying to dismiss the obvious systemic contradictions in Bono's declarations and activities, which we touched on here and courtesy of which he found himself largely -- and quite understandably -- disowned by his people, will probably see it as yet another instance of posing done by the rock star persona and nicely illuminated from all sorts of artsy angles, but, at the end of the day, offering zero actual genuineness. And may have not such a good time...But even if you happen to be in the second camp, examining the story of Bono and the band -- which is indeed fascinating in its own way -- may be helpful. And this documentary is a valuable contribution in this sense. Bono himself isn't likely to go for this kind of soul-searching. But others probably should. Because it's almost impossible to believe that the very people who had enough vision, artistic potential, and personal integrity to create the magic that is U2's early albums could somehow mutate into their current incarnations -- both as artists and human beings. So there is a great lesson there. It looks like even if you are OK and you gain success at the level where the whole world is yours, it's not the end of it. It very much looks like it's only the beginning...",False
11,10,Masterpiece,fashionela,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have read the book, and I have seen this beautiful monodrama two times in one day. This only means that I am more sure of what I am about to state. It's a masterpiece. The way Bono talks about his life in front of the audience in Naples is equally captivating as seeing Al Pacino yelling or Brando's performance in The Godfather. And what is especially captivating is his telling of his life story. It is very emotional, and yet he manages to speak without falling apart or shedding a tear. Maybe it didn't break him on the stage, but I am sure it moved the audience.Between his intimate confessions, he is not reciting Shakespeare; he is reciting songs he wrote as a teenager with the same enthusiasm that led four teenagers in Ireland to become one of the greatest rock bands of our time. He showcased that his performance is captivating, and that he really doesn't need the Sphere to get your attention.",False
12,7,"Confessional, Startling, Infuriating, Humble",david-meldrum,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film of Bono's show promoting his memoir is as intimate, confessional, and occasionally startling as the book itself. With a well-designed stage show that takes in new versions of a variety U2 songs, and some imaginative staging of the monologues, it's a show that even at times plays with the idea that Bono may be an unreliable narrator of his own story. It won't convince the die-hard Bono-haters, nor change much the extreme Bono-fans think; but it is shot through with insight, and a good motivation to seek the book out. Andrew Dominik wisely shoots it in black and white, adding to the confessional tone, and the show mostly focuses on Bono's complex relationship with his father. Occasionally both infuriating and thrilling, it's at once what you expect it to be ... and nothing like you expect.",False
13,4,The music is great but the ego driven pretension is tough to watch,sotampacane,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI was once a huge U2 fan and recognize that they have made a lot of great music over the past 45 years. Bono is a great frontman but his posturing and hypocrisy just gets me annoyed.I went into this willing to watch 90 minutes hoping the good will outweigh the bad. It was very interesting in spots and I assume that seeing it live probably would be better than this. But the way it was edited had me looking at my phone constantly praying it would move itself along.A two minute bathroom break an hour in? What the heck were they thinking.I am sorry about his father and the challenges on that relationship but that alone cannot carry this film.,True
14,9,Bono at his best,mpsdsng,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a performance by Bono. Mixing is life, his parents, the creation of that big band that is U2, passing by old themes performed in a completely new way.Bono is a great performer in U2 and a very good actor.The story he tells, the ambiance, sound and image, all come togheter in a Simple but profund movie.The time passes by without you note it, auch os the pleasure in absorbing all the elements presente by a (almost) one man show.And that's what he confirm: his a one man show, however he has always present all the important elements of his life, long life.Recomend to see this movie at least one time.

15,7,Would Have Been Amazing Live,CineChamber,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was like a powerful poetry and an inspiration speech combined into a story with musical aesthetics to expand the emotions. It was honestly really cool and interesting, but also wasn't the most entertaining to watch. This is much more of a listening piece. While the written words and lights can give some extra tone to what is written here, this is made more for your ears. I would have had chills if I saw this live.",False
16,8,"Starts off slow, then becomes unstoppable",wickhamak,n/a,16/08/2025,"Patience is required at first as it takes around 20 minutes to adjust to the content and then the story telling soars along with the music. A one man show told from the view of a retrospective on a rock stars life, son and band member, with touching insights on his relationship with his father. The arc of the story goes from school, band creation, growth of fame, riches, social campaigner and family tragedy. For those of us who have lived through the journey along with U2 it draws you in and inspires you at the same time. Strongly recommend you make time to watch uninterrupted. It's a beautiful story.",False
17,8,Bono as a poet,jahzielu,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerVery artístic and dramatic performance of life stories told by one of the icons of las century.Relationship with his parents and how deep they influenced his career and perception of life is very beautiful because is constructed by U2 songs.One of the most interesting things is when Bono question himself if his philanthropy work was more a necessity of being the attention focus or a real willing of help the others. I think that after that crucial moment, his public appearance are much more selected and his protagonism is more measured. I like as exercise of build a new approach to an outstanding artist career.",True
18,3,"Far Too Stagey, Over-Produced and Over-Rehearsed",MogwaiMovieReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love the music, love the man and love the stories (which I've mostly heard before), but the presentation is far too stagey, over-produced and over-rehearsed: it comes across awkward, stilted and lifeless, and all the humour falls flat. The halfbaked and halfhearted renditions of the songs are uniformly awful, too. Would have been much better to just have shot it like a stand-up gig with two or three cameras at the side of the stage capturing the atmosphere on the night. You get the feeling he was hoping to make a ""Stop Making Sense"" or a ""Swimming To Cambodia"" but ended up with a 90-minute-long unfunny sketch for the Stephen Colbert show.",False
19,10,A deeply pious man talks about himself hour n half.,fostrhod,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bono: Songs of Surrender 2025A deeply pious man talks about himself for an hour and half.Thrown in for good measure are recollections of his Ma and Da and the ""chairs"" in the band.His band members are portrayed as chairs on stage which Bono shifts around to highlight there various plot lines and creations and meetings between the band.His stories of his Da are deeply emotional, he felt he never lived up to his dad's estimation. It finally falls into place when Bono records a song for Pavarotti.It's an interesting production, very brave on Bono's part, but then the audience are cheering acolytes who clearly are devoted to Bono.Nice reworking of some U2 songs in a simpler keyboard and strings setting.Most definitely worth watching if you like U2, or a fan of music.... Tedious if not.Ironically I watched the film 40 years to the day of U2s resurrection and global sainthood at Live Aid, Bono on the day was a dick,(saving an girl
In the crowd, haha) and still remains a dick. The music would grow and become essential The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree are essential to me, although I haven't given them a decent listen for a good 5 years or so, the film has pulled me back in.Tedious but excellently staged 8/10.",False

But he's the leader of the band
He is a lonely man...P. S. This is not a well-made movie that will drive no-fans to get to know Bono better. And it's not for people who believe Bono is a hypocrite with a big ego!Some find the film self-indulgent, with Bono dominating the narrative without contributions from others. The film is monotonous, stating that Bono's perspective alone becomes exhausting over the 90-minute runtime. The stage choreography is described as flat, with minimal movement, making the filmed version less engaging compared to the live experience. The lack of deep insights into U2 makes the film feel one-sided, with inter-band tensions explained away poetically rather than explored in depth.",False

Clearly he has lost touch with his place in the universe ... this film did not need to be made. Very, very, very, very boring. The U2 songs are not the same without the other members of the band. I always wondered why u2 hasn't been able to release much good music over the last 10-15 years ... and it's clear that their egos expanded beyond their reach. Apparently they live in a bubble and have little interaction anymore with everyday life.

Quite frankly, just about every time one of their songs from the last 30 years comes on the air, I jump to another station.As punishment for this snooze fest, I'd like Bono, and the rest of his band mates, to sit down and listen to all their music from the 80's...and the get your heads out of your asses and show some humility.",False

1,8,"No documentary of the year, but really good",nikierdei999,n/a,16/08/2025,"Angèle lets us peek into her raw life beyond her carefully cultivated image. We get to see even some very homey and relatable quarantine shots of her. The base themes of the documentary are not very original (fame and its positive and negative effects, anxiety due to stardom, tabloids etc.) and the people who have been following her for years won't get a lot of new information. However, after watching this documentary I feel closer to her (even though as me too, I have been following her since her first big hit, Loi the Murphy). She feels as if she were my friend, so the documentary really succeeded in humanising her. The details of her journey made me admire her and the journey that she has been through more. I could see her perfectly chiselled self at one of her concerts in Belgium this December, and after watching this documentary, I appreciate the work that she has done to be this self even more. 8/10.",False
2,4,adore angèle but this was underwhelming,alexei-jendayi-546-367169,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love angèle and great to see some footage of her working on music and living life. Def relate to the feeling of not knowing who you are and feel for her life being turned into a circus. As for the film itself, it's an overindulgent promo piece that should have been 15-20 mins. Bino in BTI days said more in a handful of hotel notes. It's also a bit too woke, winey, pandering and virtue signaling. Literally every girl i know is bi - like yeah and what? Don't know if it's a cultural thing but in the US, UK, Russia ppl would just roll their eyes. Not to take away from angele's experience but this will not age well. Seeking validation from others is a bad look. Finally, the film doesn't have much in common w angele's amazing music videos. Again, love angèle but never made to the end of this. Ultimately feeds the same machine that stole angèle's basic human experience. I would have much rather just watched angèle working in a studio or performing. Leaving this for algos and studio execs to discourage them from making artists we love do cringe things.",False
3,1,"I like Angele, but that's not enough.",akcakayamehmetr,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wish they had given a little more detail. This information is not enough for us to know him. He is told more like a teenager. Superior blind. Anyway, I went and watched the whole movie anyway. But in the end I got really bored. It could have been explained in a more interesting way. Angele's relationships could have been entered in more detail. After all, most of their songs were written for their relationship. I mean, the songs I listen to. Especially the description of their relationship would be very helpful for us to get to know him. So does his family. More detailed family relationships could have been explained with special videos and photos.",False

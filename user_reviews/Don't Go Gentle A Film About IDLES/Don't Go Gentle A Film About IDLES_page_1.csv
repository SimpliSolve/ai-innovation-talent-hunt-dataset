1,10,"Rage, rage against the dying of the light",prim_rose,n/a,17/08/2025,"Impressive, entertaining, dramatic, human, global - the story of IDLES - the path of a post-punk band formed in Bristol at the end (edge) of the '00s of XXI century to recognition, full stadiums and legions of fans around the world - reveals without euphemisms the darkest and brightest sides of life, glory, human relationships, the modern society, the constant fight with your own inner demons, for which there is no universal recipe. Acceptance, empathy, self-criticism, self-improvement, connecting with other people - through music, through lyrics, through multimodal messages that are both sincere and overly influential - are all in the nature of IDLES and radiate in an incredibly vivid way from every scene and every statement in this movie. Seen on a big screen, Don't Go Gentle: A Film About IDLES also influences the viewer (and concertgoer) through cinematography - camera, palette, cuts, pauses, track-list - at all levels this documentary corresponds fully to the sensitivity and philosophy of both IDLES themselves and anyone who not only listens the band, but identifies with its community and vision for the world at this point and the place of man in it.",False

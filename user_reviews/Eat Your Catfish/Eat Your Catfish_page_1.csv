1,9,Beautiful and anguished look at caregiving,aliminx,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie triggered me. I've been a caregiver for three people, one of them family. All of them are gone now.This was a beautiful look at a beautiful woman living a tortured existence with touches of happiness. Her relationship with her son was clearly strong and as he stood up for her and pushed back at his father when his father lacked patience or empathy it was quite powerful.Mostly, though, the reason it triggered my emotions was due to the show of patience and impatience that comes with being a caregiver. The sleep you lose, the broken appointments...the kindest people in the world have a breaking point - it's hard to find your center when you're broken down by the inevitable stress of caring for someone who relies on you for everything.This was a beautiful documentary. It made me cry. It made me google the names of everyone involved in it. Just beautiful. Anguished and sad. And, beautiful.",False

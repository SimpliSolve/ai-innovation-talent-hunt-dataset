1,10,Lovely film about how we express ourselves without words,brianmcquery-74050,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched ANALOG LOVE on the first day of lockdown in 2020 and shared this with the filmmakers:It was quite a trip to explore a time when people shared their love of music and expressed themselves in a singularly focused yet separate way. In a time when we are ordered to separate you think about the mix tape and how you gave someone this gift and they went off and experienced it on their own and interpreted what you meant and how you felt about them by your choice of songs and how you arranged them.Perhaps when we get the world back, ANALOG LOVE will have an even more profound impact on people as they reflect on this period of isolation and what they did or didn't do with that time and how they could have used it to express themselves.I hope people watch this heartfelt film and make a mixtape (even digitally) for someone they love.Bravo.",False

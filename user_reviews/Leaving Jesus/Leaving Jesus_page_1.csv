1,n/a,"God, this is good...",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ellen Fiske delivers this documentary with eloquence; capturing, extraordinarily, strong people that are fragile in the moment - but brave at heart.Leaving a religion can be, and often is, one of the most traumatic events in a person's life. For many it is not merely a change of belief - it's a disruption of an entire lifestyle. In its most traumatic expression it also comes with, various degrees of abandonment from the nearest and dearest.Leaving Jesus doesn't scrutinise the methodology used in assisting those ""trying to break free"", which is probably a good thing as there is plenty to delve deeper into on that accord. What it does do is show a pallet of; some of the fears and trepidations facing those brave enough to embark on path less structured by religious dogma.It is an interesting look into the turbulence the subjects are going through, arguably for two reasons. It provides insight into the emotional ""rollercoaster ride ahead"" potentially facing anybody considering ""losing their religion"". It also provides insights, for those that always have lived their lives ""on the other side of the fence"" by means of presenting the rationale of believers.Leaving Jesus is arguably a ""humanitarian must see"". It has a compassionate approach void of any judgmental rhetoric and provides a subtle glimpse into a turbulent period of people's lives.",False

Very emotional, evenly and deliberately slowly paced, and beautifully sad.The cinematography, cutting and editing is incredible, you might believe it's either a drama or a documentary, it is just so well made.Overall, definitely an incredible, emotional and ever important film, highly recommended watch for anyone!",True

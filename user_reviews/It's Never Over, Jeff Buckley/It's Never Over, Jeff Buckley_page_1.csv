1,8,"Excellent, but a little incomplete",mcb1970,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the second documentary about Buckley (the first, ""Everybody Here Wants You,"" was produced by the BBC in 2002), and this one is better in nearly every way.The filmmaker has chosen to tell the story of his life and all-too-brief career mainly through his mother, Mary Guibert, and two previous partners, artist Rebecca Moore and musician Joan Wasser, which brings an intimacy that illuminates his creative spark and inner life, dreams, struggles, personality, and character beautifully, warts and all. Former bandmates and friends round out the picture of a talented, complicated artist who burned brightly and all-too-briefly. It's a must-see for anyone who appreciates his musical legacy and loves a good biographical documentary. It's appropriately detailed and quite moving. I felt myself welling up with tears more than once, as his music was a big part of my 20s. The stories and testimonies of his former partners, in particular, are touching and well done, revealing sides to him that flesh out the rock star and make him human and fragile.But the story is occasionally and oddly incomplete. One noteworthy former girlfriend, Elizabeth Fraser (formerly of Cocteau Twins), who was a big influence on him musically and who is also famous for having sung a legendary cover of one his father's most famous songs, ""Song to the Siren"" (in 1983, when Jeff was just 17), is absent entirely from the narrative. Even Cocteau Twins' influence on him as a musician and singer has been excised, even though he was known to occasionally -- for fun -- cover some of their songs in his intimate Sin-Ã© live sets. (He even recorded an unreleased sketch of a duet with Fraser of his song, ""All Flowers in Time (Bend Towards the Sun),"" which one can find online if you look hard enough.) Much time is spent on his love of other artists like Led Zeppelin, however.Fraser's relationship with him, which was roughly from around 1993/1994, during his rise to fame, was not a secret -- she wrote songs about him, partially dedicated Cocteau Twins' final album to him in 1996, and co-wrote the hit Massive Attack song ""Teardrop"" about him following news of his death -- so who knows why all of that was left out. Even if she didn't want to be interviewed (as she had been for the BBC film), excluding her and her band entirely from his biography felt like a mistake, as it was a much less predictable musical association than Zeppelin or some of the other influences that were explored.So, sometimes the film seemed to be aiming to craft a specific narrative rather than tell the whole story. But every good storyteller edits out something they wish they could include! I just wish this film had been just a bit more thorough, as some of what was omitted is actually rather interesting. And again, it needn't have required Fraser being on camera, but perhaps without her it simply didn't work and had to be cut.To be sure, the film recaptures the stunning news of his untimely death in a way that feels painfully fresh, and reminds us that Buckley was a gifted artist whose loss continues to be felt -- in music, art, and not least by those who were closest to him.""It's Never Over"" is a fitting and moving tribute to Buckley's life and career.[UPDATE: I subsequently learned that Elizabeth Fraser declined to be interviewed for this film, which is consistent with her inclination towards privacy. Too bad neither she nor Cocteaus were mentioned, but if she wasn't willing to be interviewed it might have fallen flat on screen.]",False
2,7,It Really Is Never Over,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.Jeff Buckley was one of a kind whom we lost way too young. With this new documentary about his career and life, director Amy Berg, while follows the predictable biographical documentary structure that does feel repetitive, still carries an solid emotional journey to explore what made Jeff famous and important and his important musical work. Using good archive footage, participant interviews and discussions, it helps to add flavor and meat to what made Jeff special, his ideas, his background and an understanding of his personality in general. Allowing viewers to get into his world and learn what made him special.With good music choices and styles throughout, Berg approaches things appropriately and emotionally, helping tone engage with the emotions and perspectives well. I am not familiar with Jeff's music but the documentary does offer a lot to let you learn about him. Despite some pacing issues and with the predictable structure that does make things feel a tad dry with its ambitious tone, still, you feel the blues and vibe well.I'm kind of surprised a music documentary about Jeff hasn't been made sooner, especially with how his legacy and music has changed over these years.",False
3,8,Very well done,agjunk-79290,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jeff wasn't ever looking to be a worshipped idol (but oh how I did worship him!) so footage of him sharing himself (outside of performances) is not abundant, however director Amy Berg and team expertly crafted this film with his art and writings, photos, sound, and color-as well as interviews and so much of his music-to enhance and expand on the spirit of who he was as a person, partner, son, friend, bandmate, performer, and it buoyed me along with out feeling lacking at all. I wept at the end of this film from just the sheer loss of this human spirit and talent.",False
4,10,Incredible,mattiasw-17253,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wish there were more documentaries about Jeff Buckley out there, his untimely death was so tragic and i wish we could have heard more of him.This documentary is incredible, you tell everyone who was apart of the project really cared about the subject matter and the music of Jeff Buckley in general, I loved the previous Amy berg documentary about janis joplin so I am genuinely looking forward to what more she decides to do in the future even if it isn't a music documentary.Absolutely brilliant piece of media, go watch it if you haven't it's inspiring and deeply moving/tragic.(Idk what else to write because of the character limit)",False
5,10,"""It's never over""",OllieP-8,n/a,16/08/2025,Truly amazing definitely the best documentary's I've ever watched it's truly a work of art this is an absolute must watch and it's absolutely incredible to watch his life and what obstacles he had to face to become what he is famously known for. Also I love the fact that so many old interviews were used.,False
6,1,I was on the brink of insanity,TonyG-733,n/a,16/08/2025,"This ""documentary"" of images and clips with commentary was the biggest pile of nothing. I would say it's the worst piece of ""cinema"" I've seen in my life. This man has lived the same life as 30% of America besides his fame and yet, the director of this film tried to pose it as a sad life. Nothing about it was sad and all I have to say is, you will not like it, DO NOT WATCH IT.",False

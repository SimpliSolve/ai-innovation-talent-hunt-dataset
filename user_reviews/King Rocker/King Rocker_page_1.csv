1,9,Blast from the past.,Today-but-then,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like others have said, real, honest, fun.
Brought back some great memories.
In the early 80's we could travel around Brum & the whole of the WMPTE (West-Mids) bus network for 2p a journey, so going up town was cheap as chips.
Tickets for gigs were ¬£3-ish, so again, even a broke 14 year old could see some crackers. Pretty sure I saw Fuzzbox at The Odean, but like many, memories are a bit ropey.
King Kong was iconic by the flyover.
Best watched recorded so you can FF the ads.
For an immersive experience, fill an ashtray with old Embassy or JPS dog-ends, open & spill a couple of cans of Holstein Pils, leave for a couple of days & then watch in a dark room. üëç",False
2,9,Lovely stuff,davidgatheral,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's amazing to watch Stewart Lee build a riveting viewing experience from scratch. First he has chosen a wonderful subject in Robert Lloyd, the unusual rock star, virtually undiscovered in Birmingham and London. Stewart has been reading books about to make a film work because for some reason he has added a giant statue of a monkey that used to be erected in Birmingham for less than a year when Stewart and Robert were kids. When Stewart and Michael lack footage of some of Roberts stories, the monkey is rendered as a cartoon and acts the story out. I mean, what is the monkey doing in the film and how does it succeed in pulling the film together? Should use the word, genius?Robert Lloyd seems a good bloke. Drinks a lot and seems to have a good time in general. Plenty of friends and a nice son. When you listen to the Nightingales songs as available on Spotify and Deezer, you are very glad you have finally been introduced to them.I think the best bit for me was watching the clip of the Nightingales, Fuzzbox and Ted Chipppington on TV. That is pop as God meant it.Great film. Very entertaining, gripping and interesting.",False
3,9,Rocking.,TheDontTellShow,n/a,16/08/2025,"An investigation into the mysterious existence and five decades-long career of The Nightingales' lead Robert Lloyd, Britain's ultimate post-punk survivor.Stewart Lee is obviously enamoured with Robert Lloyd and his legacy, which makes the documentary self-indulgent (nothing new for Lee) but also infectiously fascinating. They just play a great double act, Lloyd insisting that everything just happens and that's how it's gone, and Lee constantly overthinking and finding profounc significance in banal historical moments.It's fun, fascinating, well-assembled and the music is great. Loved it.8.5/10.",False
4,10,Fay Wray went away but King Kong is here to stay,nickknibb,n/a,16/08/2025,There isn't anything in here I dislike. I was hooked from the start as I remembered Manzoni Gardens and trying to scale King Kong after shoplifting in Nelson House weighed down by a leather belt and overly large Brothel Creepers. Stewart Lee drove this vehicle wonderfully and I was hanging on every moment. This is no talking heads/clips compilation but a glorious tribute to one of the best bands to ever come out of Brum. I will watch this film again - but this time with a curry and a couple of beers so I experience the full effect. Good on you Stewart Lee and Michael Cumming for bringing this to our humdrum screens.All hail Robert Lloyd and the Nightingales and bring King Kong back home!,False
5,10,Bloody Wonderful.,beckypalfery,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was bloody wonderful. We were aware of The Nightingales but discovering the story of such a fantastic human staying true to his art made us talk about how we judge success in our own lives. If you do what you want to do, you are successful, and to navigate this world and still be a funny, creative and a warm human you have succeeded.
The thread running through of the journey of the giant King Kong sculpture from Bull Ring to car lot to Art Gallery was perfect, Robert Lloyd is a real artist in a world of surface tripe.
My youth, going to gigs and working in record shops, spent in part, in the midlands, was brought back to life through their journey and I feel pretty privileged to have lived through that time. Thanks for making a real treasure of a film and for reframing that period & Robert with the love and reverence it deserves.",False
6,6,Not much of the Rocker,kevin c,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is, ostensibly, a documentary about a musician i'd never heard of. But i was captivated throughout. I'm a big fan of Lee, and his warmth and love for Lloyd and his music carries this. To him The Nightingales are a band worth celebrating unashamedly, rather than treating as a curio.You never know where it's going, and strangely there's not a lot of music. And i liked how Frank Skinner, John Taylor, Nigel Slater and Robin Askwith pop up throughout to entertain.One quibble was the appalling Sky presentation. In the second half adverts every five mins proved disruptive. The is an enjoyable documentary celebrating the outsiders, the also-rans and the nearly-weres; and the enduring appeal of cult bands and scenes that exist away from the scenes of mainstream success",False
7,10,Fantastic,ben_watson-39953,n/a,16/08/2025,"King rocker is the realest documentary of the past few years. Genuinely funny and doesn't take itself too seriously, yet also manages to feel warm & human in ways few other productions have been able to match.",False
8,10,"Life-affirming, lovingly made",spearmanmichael,n/a,16/08/2025,"Warm, bit rough around the edges, p*ss-taking, just like that band it's about. A proper documentary that weaves facts, half-truths and a bit of welcome over-reaching of ideas",False
9,8,Endearingly rendered portrait of an iconoclast,svendaly,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've heard Stewart Lee (and Michael Cummings on one) on a round of podcasts promoting this so am well versed on the challenges they had in funding to get this made - as well as it being impossible to distribute in a Covid world.Furthermore challenges around available footage plus the amused frustration created by finding out elements of story that Lloyd either forgot or hadn't bothered to tell them - with the difficulty on having the opportunity to include these. His friendship with The Ramones is an example of this, albeit they managed to pull off getting this included via Danny Saltzman.What they have managed to cobble together is a charming ride through the life and career of a real outlier. Lee's relationship with Lloyd is truly one of warmth and really helps the engagement throughout.So listen to the band!",False

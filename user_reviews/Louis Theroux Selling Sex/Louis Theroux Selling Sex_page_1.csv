1,7,World's Oldest Profession,refinedsugar,n/a,15/08/2025,"Right away this doc poses the question if ""selling sex can ever be a healthy way to make money"". Louis has been down this road before, but 'Selling Sex' approaches the topic by genuinely fleshing out the people doing this line of work. Sad undertones, financial realities & society's judgements. It doesn't break new ground, but it's down to earth nature is inviting and makes for an easy watch.He talks with a 33 year old single mother of four who's been doing it since she was 29. No mention of the children's father(s) are made, but it left me curious. He also speaks with a retired couple where the wife does it on the side and a 23 year old funding her last year of school who did webcam work before escorting. There's uncomfortable spots, but they're heartfelt because it reminds you these people are human.As someone who hasn't experienced either side of the coin - the subject is interesting. Fascinating to listen to a male partner who accepts their spouse doing this line of work as an element of hurt lingers beneath the surface. A daughter's uneasy task at 14 years old grasping her mom doing this. A young woman battling mental issues, a broken childhood. Broader issued like whenever they get pleasure from it. Like his brothel journey, Louis gets some talk from the client side and what they get out of it.Interested in this sexual marketplace or just open minded, this is an intriguing look into a practice that is becoming more common place. Much more accessible in this modern digital age. Where it falls on the morality scale, damage done to those involved is left open to debate. Though illegal in many places, you learn it's above board in the UK too.",False
2,n/a,A b-side.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"The fact that some men here comment on the level of attractiveness of the subjects says more about them and why they were watching this than about documentary. Also, ""Louis looks sad""? Really? That's just his style! It's called deadpan.",False
3,10,It's the best documentary about sex work,tujo-75625,n/a,15/08/2025,It was so moving I brought tears to my eyes. It also empowered sex workers by telling the stories of clients who wouldn't be able to enjoy sex if it wasn't for sex workers. Would highly recommend,False
4,3,A Victim Skewed Narrative and Surface Level Investigation,isabellekharrison,n/a,15/08/2025,A diverse range of subjects (at a stretch) but very pessimistic narrative which did not do justice to the individual stories and motivations. This could have truly shown an important view on the individual needs and benefits of SW as an income and personal need but the constant reflection on previous experiences and childhood while in no doubt relevant created a not so subtle narrative around trauma from early age and young adulthood. Would have expected a better investigation and less biased narrative. Not his best work and disappointing given the A+ individuals that agreed to partake.,False
5,1,Terrible documentary,niina-63634,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was not objective at all. The questions were leading the interviewees to a predetermined direction and the commentary presented a biased view instead of providing some kind of fresh viewpoint to the subject. Would not recommend anyone to waste time on this, there are already too many similar documentaries.",False
6,1,Not Louis's best,rigidrecords,n/a,15/08/2025,"Let me start by saying I love Louis Theroux and most of his documentaries. This one, I felt he feel short. Mainly the subject matter is so tired, been done a million times. Yes, women sell themselves and get money. It's been called the oldest profession in the world.
Secondly the people he finds to portray are crazy. They red haired lady is WELL past her prime.Time to settle down and stop thinking your 16 still. (my opinion of course)
The other women from Knottingham is another, she looks almost 50 with kids.
Also, prostitution in the UK seems way more tame than the US.Sorry Louis, just not your best material. If you need suggestions for new documentaries, ask your fans.",False

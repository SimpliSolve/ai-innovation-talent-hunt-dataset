1,1,A jaded view of our society over the last 50 years,rodw-77-924268,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is difficult to review a ""documentary"" without delving into the accuracy of the opinions given.The entire film was a series of talking heads complaining about the oil industry, in particular, but society in general.It portrayed an overly negative view without delving into any of the positive outcomes of society and seemed to catastrophise every modern event.The presentation was slick and aimed at portraying a serious factual presentation of information but the lack of balance made the whole show feel like a propaganda exercise rather than a genuine effort to discuss the merits of society over the past 50 years.The use of young children saying how scared they felt about the future, using language beyond their years made it all fell rather scripted and not very genuine.These sorts of films tend to blur the lines between what is a true factual documentary and what is really a blend of fact and fiction.",True
2,3,"Well Inensioned, but porly exicuted.",brelanda,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary covers the Oil Industry as it relates to the way it was implemented in Great Britain concerning the North Sea.It covers the uneven and poor management of the sectors of the North Sea. The way the government, in the 70's to the present, prioritize financial gains over environmental concerns or energy independence.A lot of information is contained in the film and well developed, but the production is so flat and uninspiring. It will take viewer all the concentration and desire of a college student pulling an all-nighter to pass an exam on the history of belt buckles in relation of the development of pants.It's all in there, but next to no one well get anything out of it.",False
3,10,Exposes the history of North Sea Oil and how it is now.,ssaatzer,n/a,15/08/2025,Shows what we need to know about the history of North Sea Oil. How badly managed it has all been and how those who manage these things don't really care about people or the environment. Especially the ocean. The arrogance of man and the greed. It breaks my heart really to watch it all. I know that I consume the same as the next person what comes out of all this. I have benefited. But these people knew the fullness of what is behind it all from the very start. I don't appreciate how long this review needs to be. Why do you require us to write a full essay on it. That is bad manners. I dmire those who have committed and so I will too.,False
4,10,Brilliant Film,chrissieaba,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well researched and extremely well documented. The real problem with our society today is exposed as the enmeshment of the big oil corporations with our political bodies and therefore their control over our society. It was a chilling and frightening watch but so important that we, the population know who really are controlling our society.I would have liked to have more information on how this enmeshment could be disabled and how we as a society regain control.I was shocked to learn that the North sea oil is not for the UK's own use but the whole area is carved up and licenses sold to other countries drilling companies.Change needs to happen and this film is going to be part of ensuring that change happens.",False
5,9,An eye-opening peer into the machinery we are all a part of,mystifying-68452,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm glad I watched this. The documentary lays out the physicality of the North Sea oil infrastructure from oil platforms, pipes and refineries to the products we use. A machine is a good analogy. It also covers how politics intersects with this physicality - the divvying up of the sea into squares to be leased out to big corporations an foreign interests.There were some shocking stats in there on how many licenses are given to non-UK entities like China. It undermines the argument that we need new oil fields for our energy sovereignty.The voices of the youth were maybe a bit hyperbolic, but it stems from real fears they have for their futures. Scientists continue to be surprised at the pace of climate change exceeding predictions, so maybe they are onto something.Definitely worth a watch. Everyone needs to watch this. Especially politicians and those working in finance.Following on from viewing, it's important to take action. Email your MP. Find out about campaigns like Stop Rosebank and Just Transition for off-shore workers.The screening I went to mentioned the report from Friends of the Earth Scotland: Our Power: Offshore Workers' Demands for a Just Energy Transition. I'd highly recommend as further reading.",True
6,10,Interesting and thought provoking documentary,drpsimmons,n/a,15/08/2025,"I agree with all the positive reviews. It was quite slow and thoughtful, but that gave one time to think about what was being said. Try to stick with it, as you will probably learn like I did. I discovered a lot about the economics of the oil business, and how the North Sea has been carved up and sold to foreign companies. Not only has that squandered the potential wealth from the North Sea, but it has reduced our political control over closing down our reliance on oil, as the government must do to have any chance of hitting the net zero targets. It was good how they interviewed children about their worries, after all they are the ones who are going to have to deal with the consequences of our failure to cut greenhouse gases.",False
7,9,Good background,mtulley-69419,n/a,15/08/2025,"Probably not in the league of 'don't look up' for stars or production values, but an interesting film none the less. Reminds us how recently we started Oil extraction in UK - and more than half gone now. Of course if we want to keep below 2C we have to use less than half of current rates by 2030 - 7 years time. So in 7 years time, half of the petrol cars on the road will be parked up, and half of the gas central heating will be removed. But that's only if we want our kids to have a liveable earth.This review site seems to want more characters, so just have a look at Ireland retrofit - Electric Ireland Superhomes. Great scheme to retrofit, make homes comfy, affordable and green.",False
8,10,Unforgettable film demands action now!,rcstubley,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI saw this at a community screening followed by a discussion - a good way to watch this thought-provoking film, which demands that we DO something about our planet-wrecking fossil fuel industry. There are lots of powerful people who DON'T want change because they'll lose money.... The plastics industry/pollution relies on oil, bankers have made huge profits from oil and plastics, as have wealthy politicians and shareholders... But the young people, scientists, activists, lawyers and others in the film were clear and inspirational... we need to change to renewable energy systems, stop polluting our planet with plastics, reduce our consumption and carbon footprint... For starters, join the weekend of action in London 21-24 April 2023!",True

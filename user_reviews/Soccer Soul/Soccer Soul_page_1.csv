1,7,"Good documentary that plagiarizes the documentary ""Heroes"" verbatim.",juancruz1974,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs an Argentine, I naturally loved it. But it must be said: at least in the original Spanish version several phrases are shamelessly robbed from another similar documentary called ""Heroes"" (Mexico'86 World Cup). Also the music and some filming resources are copied from that same movie. I would have appreciated more originality in that respect, but overall it is a good movie and will not disappoint soccer fans. Unlike Heroes (which was about the whole tournament), this one is almost 100% centered on the Argentine team and includes interviews with several significant members of the Argentine national team.",True
2,5,The picture of mediocrity and safe documentary-making,SmudgeSmill,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love a documentary that explores the different perspectives of an event, or a historical story. This was not that.This documentary was solely focused on Argentina, and in presenting Argentina in a positive light -- most notably evinced by the fact that, multiple times, they referenced Diego Maradona and the 1986 World Cup and even showed footage of that tournament, entirely without mentioning the Hand of God moment. This was a missed opportunity as documentarians, but also as Argentines.I enjoy watching a bit of 'soccer', but I don't worship it. As such, I found this to be overly emotive and taking itself way too seriously with the evocative narration and music.If you have a couple of hours to spare, just rewatch the world cup final rather than watching this.",False

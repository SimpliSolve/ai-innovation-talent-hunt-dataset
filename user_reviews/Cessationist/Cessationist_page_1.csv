1,4,A Mixed Bag,cchenders40,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rightly condemns false teachers, faith healers and the like. Heretics like Kenneth Copeland, Hinn, Bakker and so on.But strings clips of godly men who are open to gifts like Sam Storms, Carson, John Piper, and others along with them but ate not faith healers or false teachers. It is a manipulative tactic to make these men look guilty by association. This documentary was not done in good faith toward other faithful men. Yes please condemn faith healers but don't smear godly men in your own camp (reformed). I am shocked that this exists. There is no hoping snd believing all things here.They also constantly change arguments, show partial verse quotes, and ignore key texts. Make arguments from theoretical implications of texts, and experience.Very disappointed with this documentary.",False
2,1,Just an attack against beliefs they don't have.,lisaempoweredwellness,n/a,15/08/2025,"Someone has an agenda. I have not, nor ever will be part of the charismatic movement but never would I attack them the way this movie does. From a Christian standpoint a) they take biblical references out of context. Matthew was very much talking to a certain group of people at that time, Paul spoke those words but in context that looks much different than what is depicted here and easily seen by my 14 year old when we took the movie scriptural clips and read the whole context. Why would we as Christians support attacking vs teaching, leading to Christ and honoring/respecting his chosen?People are free to believe all this. I'm not saying they can't. But when you provide information like this, against a group of believing Christians, and then take things out of context it's hard not to see the irony in what you are doing vs what is truth.Watch the movie, go read the context of the scripture they are giving. Also note they reference things ""not happening"" but don't take into account this isn't the main theme of the Bible, there are a LOT of things not placed in there due to the irrelevance to the main subject/theme of the Bible. Jesus didn't heal everyone that came to him and not all that were healed were documented. That goes for all the things the apostles and beyond did. Not all was documented there either. Not relevant for salvation and eternal life. So to take that and dramatically use it to prove some point is making up stuff to prove things God doesn't even deem important to scripture.What if these same people spent time going out and spending time with these pastors and people that they feel are being misled and just taught them the word and left all this out? Guarantee they could spend years without even getting to this subject and teach them how to respect the gifts and beyond.",False
3,1,A good comedic film,flyingmattressman,n/a,15/08/2025,"The fact that this movie was even made is hysterical.Cessationists are essentially the atheists of Christianity, they see something they don't like and don't even try to experience it in a biblical way. They just say it doesn't exist.Prooftexting, taking scripture out of context, ignoring church history that doesn't agree with their view is all in there.Tons of Cherry picking of bad charismaticism to prove their point, but no mention of Sam Storms, Jack Deere, R. T Kendall, and many other grounded continuationists who see miracles/signs occur regularly.***If you want for more detailed criticism of the movie and the points it makes Remnant Radio has already done a 3-part series picking it apart.***If you're a continuationist, you're more in line with the Bible and Church history and no, you don't have to agree with Modern Charismaticism either.""Pursue love, yet earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy."" 1 Cor. 14:1.",False
4,3,Watch with your Bible in hand!,dmpgfhm,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie is done well as far as videography. The Biblical manipulation they go thru to malign the scriptures is Antichrist. Ex. Using St Augustine as an example of a cessationist. ST A quote ... Even now, therefore, many miracles are wrought, the same God who wrought those we read of still performing them, by whom He will and as He will; but they are not as well known, nor are they beaten into the memory, like gravel, by frequent reading, so that they cannot fall out of mind.The scriptures are clear. This movie has some weird agenda. Sorry ... wish I could say better.'Remnant Radio' does a great response to the lies and misleading examples in this movie.Read your Bible. Believe the Bible not these guys.",False
5,10,Very Well Done!,justinpfrye-16734,n/a,15/08/2025,No matter what side of the conversation you fall on this is a phenomenal movie that clearly portraits what cessationists believe. The videography and story telling is top notch. You will walk away with biblical teaching as well as a lesson on church history. Both working together to clearly explain why the sign gifts have ceased and the harm caused by hyper charismatic continuationist today.The negative reviews I saw for this movie sound like they didn't even watch it and contain the same misrepresentation of what a cessationist believes that is so often shared.I've watched the remnant radio response videos to this movie and they are filled with straw man arguments and caricatures all while ignoring the great harm caused over time by people who teach and preach the supernatural to manipulate those who are hurting and sick and get rich.,False
6,3,"Some good -, but overall highly deficient discernment and theology.",fitforfaith-ministries,n/a,15/08/2025,"PROS+ Great production quality, images, visualizations and music.+ Some good discernment on the excesses of (extreme) Pentecostalism and Charismatics (Aimee Semple Mc Pherson, Alexander Pagani, Benny Hinn, David Diga Hernandez, Eric Shonebarger, Isaiah Salvidar, Jeremiah Johnson, Jim Bakker, Jimmy Swaggert, John G. Lake, Kathryn Kuhlman, Mark Taylor, Michael Brown, Mike Bickel, Mike Signorelli, Morris Cerullo, Paula White, Robin Bullock, Ryan Rufus, Sid Roth, Smith Wigglesworth, Todd Bentley, Todd Smith).+ Correct exhortation on not speaking gibberish, not having the primary focus on tongues, and not confusing ecstatic experiences -which occur even in Pagan religions- with Christian salvation.+ Quote Dan Phillips: ""In biblical times when you stood up and you spoke in G-d's name and it was not G-d's word, you were stoned to death. Today if somebody does that, either it's inconsequential or doesn't come true, nothing happens. It's just another day ... in the Charismatic community. At least they should be excommunicated."" I fully affirm this notion.CONSThis documentary is a Calvinist gong-show (see list below). Practically all of the speakers are Calvinists. The same method has been noted in many books and movies by that group, when a cult-like mentality is applied by exclusively selecting / endorsing Calvinist interview partners. A documentary on discernment should be balanced and not just come from like-minded people.Min 05:10: Appeal to emotionalism when Elijah raises the widow's son. Here they still pretend to accept miracles.Min 06:20: ""There were times, 3 of them in Scripture, where G-d gave to man the power to work miracles""5500-1400BC No miracles
1400BC Moses & Joshua 65 years of miracles
1400-800BC No miracles
800BC Elijah & Elisha 65 years of miracles
800BC-30AD No miracles
30-100AD IESOUS & The Apostles 65-70 years of miracles
100-2024AD No more miraclesThe interview partners are essentially claiming that miracles in biblical history only occurred during 195-200 years in total!! This is one the most ridiculous claims ever heard and every serious reader of the Bible will instantly have one's hair stand on end when hearing such a claim.Not only does the Bible tell us countless miracles of Samuel, Samson and many others in between those 3 times, most importantly the Bible itself refutes their erroneous claim in Jer 32:20: ""You have shown signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and TO THIS DAY in Israel and among all mankind, and have made a name for yourself, as at this day."" Jeremiah was written ~585-570 BC, meaning 800+ years after the Exodus and 200+ years after Elijah/Elisha.Min 10:30: Here Sam Waldron manipulates the viewer by confusing IESOUS being the cornerstone and foundation of the church, with the spiritual gifts itself. The foundation of a church building has little to do with the gifts used inside, but Waldron suggests that because the foundation was laid in a specific moment, so spiritual gifts ceased instantly after that moment. A truly ridiculous comparison.Min 11:20: Here Tom Pennington explains the qualifications of an Apostle, but he either unintentionally or rather intentionally leaves out the Spiritual Gift of Apostleship, which definitely continues to be a gift for believers selected by the HOLY SPIRIT. The mission is to have authority over unclean spirits and healing (Mat 10:1-2), and further to encourage and strengthen other churches, to plant new ministries and churches, go into places where the Evangelium is not preached (missionaries, 'apostello'), raise up and develop leaders, and call out and lead pastors. Their own Conrad Mbewe, whom they sent out to plant Calvinist churches in Africa, is pretty much in such a role (although on the bad side).Min 14:20: Steven Lawson and Tom Pennington tell us that there is no mention of signs and miracles once you pass the book of 1Cor. This is a highly ignorant claim, knowing very well that the narrative of the Bible was nearly closed with the 4 Evangelia and the book of Acts. Everything that follows are simply letters and the next narrative is Revelation, which is our future. To now say that because we have no narrative between Acts and Revelation, we have also no use of Spiritual Gifts, is a straw man fallacy.Min 18:40: Nathan Busenitz endorses Augustine and uses him to strengthen the argument for Cessationism (while leaving out that Augustine changed his view ...). Augustine was one of the most problematic figures in ~Christian~ history, being the doctor of the RCC and the patriarch of Calvinism, and of countless heresies that came into the church through and shortly after him, only to mention the Apocrypha, infant baptism, financial tithing, sex being evil, perpetual virginity of Mary, prayers to saints, the 7 Catholic sacraments, amillennialism .... He was also the father of the doctrine of persecution.Busenitz shows therefore a fundamental lack of discernment, which is sadly very common amongst academics. Solely based on Chrysostom and Augustine, he then suddenly concludes: ""The view of the (early) church has been decidedly Cessationist"". This is a very poor scholarship.We have to be aware of the fact that quoting history and / or historians opens the gate for every kind of false teaching, because we can find a historian for nearly every theology we want to propagate. This would not be such a problem if we would only use reliable historians. But this is definitely not the case as perfectly seen by the common use e.g. Of those church fathers 'Augustine' or also very often 'Origen', both very problematic figures of 'Christian' history. At the end of the day we have to go back to the Word and avoid extrabiblical sources - what is possible in the vast majority of Bible studies.Busenitz then drifts into primitive manipulation, by putting Continuationists into the role of those desperately searching for historical reference points and associating them with a heretical movement which literally no Christian of our day has ever heard of:""In order to find evidence of miraculous gifts throughout church history, the modern continuationist has to redefine what those gifts are. They generally do so by pointing to french movements and french groups like the Montanus movement, which was declared a heresy by the early church.""Min 32:30: Sam Waldron goes here as far as to open war within their own rows, by discrediting D. A Carson, John Piper, Sam Storms and Wayne Grudem as having 'reformed inclinations' simply because they describe themselves as 'open but cautious' (so as to say 'Second-class Calvinists' in his eyes; later they sequence a video of Sam Storms with Mike Bickel, and even use the repentance of Sam Storms from Cessationism to discredit him; David Lovi/Les Lanphere have obviously a serious issue with him). Firstly, all of those are problematic teachers (and Calvinists) and this is an inhouse discussion. Secondly, one like John Piper can hardly be anymore Calvinist than he is. This war within their own rows shows that they are divided even on that issue.Min 58:30: Here Sam Waldron underlines his evil intentions, by criticizing Sam Storms' correct preaching of 1Cor 14:1, where Paul commands to earnestly desire the gifts of the HOLY SPIRIT. Waldron then states that ""All commands of the Bible come to us within an assumed context"" and terribly twists the Bible when stating that Paul violated IESOUS' command to not take money on the journey (Mat 10:9-10), but had accepted donations on the journey. Even to the most naive viewer it should be obvious that there is a huge difference between taking money along, and receiving it. IESOUS never forbade any apostle to receive money or material gifts, He only said that they ought to start with essentailly nothing.Min 62:50: Scott Aniol creates the false notion that speaking in tongues is always referring to known languages. He uses Act 2:8 which correctly refers to known languages and then extrapolates this to be the general rule for all expressions of tongues, while ignoring 1Cor 13:1 !!!Speaking in tongues includes both 'foreign languages' and an 'ecstatic / heavenly language' (see 1Cor 13:1 with the clear differentiation btw. A) tongues of men and B) tongues of angels who obviously do not primarily speak earthly languages; and 1Cor 14:2 with the remark 'no one understands' the 'mysteries in the Spirit'). Speaking in tongues serves as A) Communication with, and impression of unbelievers (Act 2:1-15, 1Cor 14:16, 22), B) Edification of the church (1Cor 14:5-6, 12, 24) and C) Edification of yourself (1Cor 14:4, 27-28). Tongues spoken in public must be interpreted (1Cor 12:10, 1Cor 14:2, 11, 13, 27-28), but we see this almost never being practiced in today's churches.Nathan Busenitz then supports their perceived abolition of ecstatic languages by stating that it occurred for the first time in history ever when noted through the Charismatic Movement, which is an unsubstantiated claim.Min 95:55 confirms their de-facto abolishment of Spiritual Gifts: ""Well, if we don't have the Spiritual Gifts, what do we have? We have the self-authenticating Word of G-d. When we have the HOLY SPIRIT promised to bless that Word, there is no reason for disappointment ... that is all we need.""LIST OF INTERVIEW PARTNERSAndreas Wiget (not Wigit ...; Calvinist)

7,10,Very well done!,gheffner-89532,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerCessationist is simply the Biblical proof for the Christian belief that the Apostolic Era gifts of the Spirit have ceased. Miracles still happen, God still heals, and God is still sovereign. But the pretended ""gifts of the spirit"" pushed by charismatics are not among His miracles. Excellent movie. Take special note of Justin Peters and John MacArthur's contribution. The poignant story of Eutychus pointed out what the Lord accomplished by the hand of Paul and the contrast of the spectacle made by Bethel Church over baby Olive was a dramatic, though sad, way of explaining the differences of that era with ours. A solid movie that strengthens rather than weakens faith.",True
8,n/a,We need unity,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Probably one of the saddest documentaries I've seen... Just one camp in the church trying to prove a point while trying to sever itself from the other parts of the body that they believe are wrong.It's pretty interesting how they pick all the scriptures that back of their theology when there's many more that would actually contradict the theology they came up with. But they don't talk about those.One being the gifts of the spirit. The gifts weren't for the apostles to approve their message, though that did happen. The gifts are for the church for the benefit of all 1 Corinthians 12:7. And the Holy Spirit is the one who gives those gifts and last I checked the Holy Spirit didn't die.I do agree that the church has a lot to get in order, I just don't think the message this documentary displayed was the right answer.,.I pray we can overlook our differences with issues that aren't salvific. And that every side would humble itself and realize it needs the other and that it would stop trying to cut each other off and tear each other down.",False
9,10,Very accurate,dougjpeterson,n/a,15/08/2025,I spent many years in the new apostolic Reformation and the Uber charismatic circles and this was very well done. There are certain people who want to protect these heretics displayed in the movie. I'm not sure why but this movie was very accurate and well done. I know that there are certain individuals that marked it negatively and didn't see it only because they are trying to spread misinformation. It's unfortunate but I recommend watching it. If you are someone who loves God and loves his word then you will definitely love this movie. I would suggest praying before you watch it. Read every scripture in context that is a brought up and pray after you will see for yourself that this is a great movie.,False
10,10,The 1-Star Reviewers Don't Understand The Bible,kubrick4277,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary film takes the Bible and explains the context for the verses that continuationists use to claim that spiritual gifts and prophecies are still occurring to this day. The cessationist viewpoint is the only way to rightly understand that A) there are no living Apostles, B) the spiritual gifts and prophecies ceased after 1 Corinthians, and C) anyone who is claiming that A & B are not true have AWFUL Hermeneutics and are making a mockery of God by claiming that the Holy Spirit is working through them.And tongues, by the way, means discernible language. It's an actual dialect, not gibberish that someone claims is a real language. They're fooling themselves and weak-minded individuals who aren't looking for God, but rather to have their infirmities taken away from them. That's not what God and the Bible is about. Anyone who thinks otherwise is an apostate. Period. Full stop.",False
11,10,Sola Scriptura > personal revelation,rosesaphira,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're a born again believer and you're unsure how to back up your belief that the gifts of healing, prophecy, and tongues has ended, this movie is a wonderful resource! Wonderfully filmed and I love that they take you to the scripture. The history behind the charismatic movement is so revealing and it exposes the deceitfulness and danger of believing that God gives man the power to heal in this currant age. The mental gymnastics (misusing scripture) they have to do to make people believe that the gift of speaking in tongues is still around is crazy. So many people grow up in the charismatic word of faith movement that they don't even know anything different. I hope this documentary reaches the right people and will give those who believe in the truth to give a defense.The word of God is sufficient for everything. No new revelation is needed.",False
12,9,Humbly and Pray and Read the Scriptures too,tcal_enchristos,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""Cessationist"" is a 2023 documentary directed by Les Lanphere that presents a defense of cessationism-the belief that certain miraculous spiritual gifts, such as prophecy, tongues, and healing, ceased with the apostolic age. The film features interviews with notable Reformed theologians, including Joel Beeke, Phil Johnson, and Steven Lawson, and critiques continuationism, which holds that these gifts continue today.Content Overview:The documentary argues that miraculous gifts were clustered around specific periods in biblical history-namely, the times of Moses and Joshua, Elijah and Elisha, and Jesus and the apostles-to authenticate God's messengers. It posits that after these foundational periods, such gifts ceased. The film also critiques modern charismatic practices, highlighting instances of what it considers to be abuses or excesses within the movement.Critical Reception:The film has elicited mixed reactions:
Positive Reviews: Tim Challies, a Reformed blogger, commends the documentary for providing a valid defense of cessationism and offering a fair critique of continuationism. He appreciates its examination of scriptural evidence and its balanced treatment of opposing views.Negative Reviews: Critics argue that the documentary employs manipulative tactics, such as juxtaposing extreme charismatic figures with respected theologians like John Piper and Sam Storms, potentially leading to guilt by association. Some reviewers feel that the film misrepresents continuationist positions and relies on selective scriptural interpretations.Conclusion:""Cessationist"" is a well-produced documentary that articulates the cessationist perspective and critiques aspects of the charismatic movement. Its reception varies, with some praising its thoroughness and others cautioning against perceived biases. Viewers interested in the debate over spiritual gifts may find it informative, but should approach it with discernment and consider exploring it with humble prayer and their Bible.",True

1,4,For most people nothing new.,richiestyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is all pretty old news for people who usually follow a bit of stuff on the subject of UFOs and aliens. Most of the images of the TR-3B used in this documentary have been on YouTube or internet in general for a long time, and therefore not innovative in terms of information. What also annoyed me was the way too long nagging from Richard Dolan and Jeremy Rys. Especially with Jeremy it took too long for me and because of that I started to lose interest.Verdict: missed opportunity!",False
2,6,truthseekers doing their hard job,alterschwede-36868,n/a,16/08/2025,"Its work and its documentary work. I think they just seeking and try to find the truth and wha they say is true.I think a lot of people they its speculation but the ufo phenomenon is well explained in the documentary
the triangula ufos are real .",False
3,1,Starting to think this is all a money scheme,wescartee,n/a,16/08/2025,"The more I get into watching these UFO/alien documentaries, the more I start to think they are a bunch of liars. The same people are always on these docs, and the never provide any strong evidence at all. They make wild unfounded claims over and over. ""Stay tuned next week to find out if we actually have evidence for any of this"". Majority of these ufologists are cons, just trying to make an extra buck. Don't waste your time with this ridiculous documentary.",False
4,2,This was really boring,hbuch,n/a,16/08/2025,I've seen two black triangles. With 3 other people. Both were seen at the same time. Flew over us very low. Then stayed hovering in the distance for several mins so we had time to really see the details. I thought this was going to have some kind of info that would be interesting. Maybe even explain it with some actual science. What I saw is not what they show over and over. Maybe I saw an older model in 1997? I don't know. I still wonder what I saw and still look for info. This show didn't have any info that was worth paying to even rent it. I can see these videos/clips for free on YouTube. Disappointed should have known. Wasted 5 bucks and a hour of my time. I mean this Tyler dude couldn't even be bothered to film himself on a set or outside even. He's in his bedroom. Really dude. Was it during covid lockdown?! Wanted more out of this.,False
5,1,"Same desperate nonsense, different viddy.",konstantinavalentina,n/a,16/08/2025,"You can get all the CGI woo woo, and potato cam videos of satellites after dusk reflecting sunlight off their solar panels and disappearing as they fall into Earth's shadow, plus blurry camera bokeh filmed with triangle aperture so oooo spooky triangle lights ... on youtubes for free.All these people want you to buy their books, videos, or other swag at UFO conventions, and the willingness of easily duped masses to part with cash for stories about flying saucers is well documented.",False
6,1,Lies and nonsense,dogg-99079,n/a,16/08/2025,"Full of misrepresentations, deceptions, and other BS in general.One example is when they show the google patents page of an abandoned 'triangular spacecraft' patent, and blatantly lie to the audience that the US Navy applied for it when the applicant is displayed on the screen and it is an individual. The US is crossed out and the word abandoned is on screen. I had a quick look and one of this individual's other abandoned patents is titled 'Cavitating oil hyperspace energy generator'. I'm surprised that they didn't try to also pass this one off as a 'navy' patent.If you enjoy being taken for an idiot, watch this.",False
7,9,"Very informative, if you haven't already been exposed to this information, and entertaining.",sjnsujon-33471,n/a,16/08/2025,"Of course, Tyler from SecureTeam was featured as a prime speaker (who else?). If you don't take anything else away from this video it is that the TR3B's (triangular UFO's) are man-made from back-engineered UFO technology. No real surprise there. Anyway, it's an entertaining and informative show that drills down into the supression of information by the dark side of the government.",False
8,1,Not worth paying to watch,cpobarnet,n/a,16/08/2025,Just stick with the CGI videos on Tyler Glockners YouTube than spend money on this rehash of known information. Would see more value if they don't use actual frauds in the documentaries. Especially if you are trying to come across as authentic.,False
9,10,A Government Coverup? Yeah.,wradams-06504,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great movie introducing us to secret government projects and how/why they are covered up. I loved the movie and will watch it again with a friend. Before you blow off the subject, take a small part of your day to check out this movie. I found it very interesting, although the issue about common space agency insignias was a little much for me. Worth a second watch to understand better. Go check this out!",False
10,3,Disappointed again,matt-233-497899,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know why I keep watching UFO ""documentaries"" hoping to finally see something that will confirm my sincere hope that aliens exist. Grainy footage and anecdotes isn't gonna cut it. My expectations were even lower for this one. I was just hoping for some insight as to how a TR2B might operate. There was about 5 minutes of that and it was pretty weak. There was a guy who attributed a quote to a long time director of the Skunk Works. He literally said to google it. So I did and there's only a few mentions of it on some UFO sites. That's like saying the bible is true because the bible says the bible is true. And maybe the reason air and space agencies often have arrow iconography on their insignia is because through all of human history we've know that pointy things fly well. That seems a lot more likely than a huge global conspiracy. Eh why do I bother.",False
11,2,Run. And keep your $,casey-42712,n/a,16/08/2025,"Three words. Tyler. Glockner. Fraud.Can't believe this hack is still getting views let alone getting people to actually believe him.Nothing new, all conjecture, ""animations"" and of course bad photos.As unbelievable and patently planted as Luis Elizondo ""testimony"".",False
12,1,Nothing You Have not Heard before; A Pointless Presentation Of Nothing!,silicontourist,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am an avid believer that we share our universe, and beyond, with other planetary inhabitants/species/races. I don't however believe in people making useless non informative home movies - I wouldn't give this the acknowledgement of being a documentary - that do nothing to expand information on the topic in question. It gave no definitive information of what a TR3B even was (which would have been of use to people watching, who are not familiar with the secret space industry).All the films and images shown were of terrible quality and could have been cleaned up better for viewing purposes and, a lot of it was regurgitated stuff seen on hundreds of similar exposure sites. There are just too many people flooding the internet with needless info; that has already been told thousands of times already!",False
13,1,"Terrible and amateurish, no new info.",SamRawr,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is basically an hour and a half of Secureteam videos with Tyler doing his thing. There's nothing new other than a few wacky conspiracy theories about triangle shapes being used on space-related arm patches. Doesn't seem to have grasped that they represent rocket exhaust plumes from vacuum engines, thinks they represent TR3-B's.Very minimum effort, poor sound editing and content that appears to have been shot with an iPhone in a motel with zero cinematography or lighting skills to speak of.It really isn't worth the money at all, DO NOT BOTHER RENTING/BUYING IT.",False
14,1,Darcy Weir is a Liar. Ed Fouche is a Liar.,hen-53537,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yep, Darcy Weir terminated LunaCognita's channel in Feb 2021, then lied about it in Tyler's interview published Aug 19, 2021. Oh, and his documentaries sucks. Oh, and I like how Edgar Fouche rages about Bob Lazar and Dan Burisch being hoaxters, when he himself got caught lying and false copyright claiming Alienscientist's video! Ed Fouche already exposed himself as a liar, he admitted it on video, ""where Ed bascially admits to lying about his entire story, and making it all up."" Source is alienscientist dot com slash fouche dot html in archive dot org. Unfortunately, too many liars, conmen, and disinformation agents have infiltrated the UFO community. Be very careful who you trust. Do your research too.",False
15,9,Great Documentary on the Triangle UFO.,bdesima-22815,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very good video to watch if you have even a slight interest in the TR3B UFO. Gives a good background on similar craft, and how they might lead up to the vehicle being both man made, and from another world.",False
16,3,"Not Unwatchable, But A Miss....",heratyplant,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is simply a stretched out episode of Secureteam on Youtube, although they've upped the ante by including, what appears to be, interviews specially done for this show, Dolan being a coup for them.I don't want to rain on Tyler's parade, he's just doing what he can to earn a buck & that's totally fine. The mistake here that I couldn't get passed, other than some poor production decisions, was made right from the start with Tyler himself. The show starts with him in bed, waking up & starting his day, in what appears to be a hotel like apartment. This is a classic documentary trope that is used to indicate that the following will be about the documentary maker as well as the subject, here being UFO's. This actually never pans out & we hear nothing of Tyler's recent difficulties & the strange things that happened to him & his YT channel. If they didn't want to talk about these topics, the doc should have been framed differently; for me this was a missed opportunity, as he could have finally cleared up these mysteries & it would have made it more worthwhile to watch & different to his usual schtick.I also don't understand, when I heard him mention this doc in a YT video, why he talked about it as if he was a bit part in the show, rather than the 'star' of it, with his branding all over it, bit odd!Honestly it really isn't terrible, the UFO footage & commentary is fine if you like this topic, but it's just a bit lazy & should've been rethought!",False
17,10,The start of the TR3B,coronzia,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAmazing...the fact that the government has been working on projects from the 1940s to the development of the TR3B, the information of everything about TR3B is very interesting. 5stars.Highly recommend watching this documentary.",True
18,2,Pure speculation!,robertanderson-28156,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a long time advocate of disclosure of the UFO/UAP topic and having read many books on the topic as well as watched near enough all the films and listened to nearly all the podcast made on this topic, my review is this:This film has some nice videos of things that show strange lights in the sky and yes i would say some are anomalous.The information from the interviews in some cases interesting but its all speculative and there is no hard evidence to back up what they are saying. In many cases its there thoughts and speculation on the matter.So overall there is nothing to be gained by watching this film.",False
19,3,TR3B are old technology!,manicheayiti,n/a,16/08/2025,"People should know the real deal about this topic. Please save your bucks because The truth is the following -->TR3B is not only old technology! YES, TR3B are old technology. But wait...did you know that the advanced aircrafts known as TR3B were a failure. According to Peter the Insider, director of the ACIO's 12 Division, TR3B were replaced by TR3C. Some of the experimentation flights were made on Mars. If in 2021, they're making TR3B as new advanced aircrafts, well the production group either don't know about the subject matter or they just want to pretend to share disclosure. People should know about the upgraded models, such as TR3H, TR3I, etc.",False
20,10,A Great Primer on How Classified Programs Work,sjnsujon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter a tasty breakfast, Tyler and his team provide the uninitiated with a baseline for how secret aircraft are developed. Then, they present sufficient photographic and documentary evidence for an individual to advance from having no knowledge of TR3B (or any other secret program) to possessing a reasonable basis to believe that such programs exist and that the TR3B is both real and probably one of them. Apparently, chevrons are a major thing but we aren't sure why. However, there are plenty of technical terms and names to provide MANY jumping off points for an individual to embark on their own study. There was original commentary from surprisingly big name guests, plus interesting technical analysis. Some of this may be old hat to very experienced UFO researchers, but I believe everybody can learn something. I did. This is a great documentary to send a friend to who needs some edumacatin'. Great Job.",True
21,10,Connecting the dots,cc-34149,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis video was very helpful for connecting the dots on a hot topic of the TR3B in Ufology. If you want to see a credible overview of the TR3B, this video is a ""Rosetta Stone"" for the topic and can be used as a basis to conduct further research. This video needs to credit Tyler Glockner and Richard Dolan as starring in the video. Well done and I look forward to a follow up in Part 2.",True
22,10,A Treat To Watch,dr-51381,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis Documentary is Truth-based and not just another UFO mystery. Right away I noticed that this is different than I expected and would be something that even a skeptic would enjoy watching. I've followed Tyler's work for several years and he is dedicated to his research, authentic & serious about his craft :)I can honestly say I learned some things & gained new perspective watching this video and strongly recommend it. It's something the entire family can watch together and the kids will want to watch it too, my almost 8 year old Grandson hung right with me from start to finish, he loves science and he loved the graphics. I like that he learned some things that no school will ever teach in a way that made an impression on him, he's telling his twin sister all about it right now!This is one to watch and I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as my family did.",True
23,10,Awesome Documentaries,khanbdfx,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGreat Documentaries, Recommend. This was a great movie for beginners and experienced UFO hunters. There alot of new information and some already gone over in many videos. Overall it was a cool experience and I'm glad i could help support secure team.",True
24,10,New information provided,colemanik,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis was a great movie for beginners and experienced UFO hunters. There alot of new information and some already gone over in many videos. Overall it was a cool experience and I'm glad i could help support secure team. #TeamUfOhio.,True
25,9,Excellent,Johntrek187,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was superbly done. This film hones in on the TR3b or black triangles, that are US produced advanced craft. These black triangles have been flying since the 80's and this film explores their existence with numerous first hand accounts of seeing these craft. Numerous video clips and pictures showing the existence of this craft. Not only here on earth, with our atmosphere, but also flying through space and along the surface of the moon. This film highlights credible individuals both in the military, in the secret aircraft programs, and journalists who have covered this story for years. They lay it all out and is very well done and is very convincing. We most definitely have these craft operating today. Who knows what else they have now...",False

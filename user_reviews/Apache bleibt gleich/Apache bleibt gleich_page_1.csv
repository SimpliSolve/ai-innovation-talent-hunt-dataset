1,10,APACHE STAYS APACHE,orlandosiekas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow! This documentary was something else. It was something else for many reasons. It was well edited and a really interesting documentary. It gave more background information about Volkan and made a good case for him. I like what he said about his style of music. I think he can be taken seriously. His message is clear. He wanted to show the world what happens when you live life like you do. This documentary not only showed some of his background, but also showed his life as an artist. I thought this was a very solid documentary and I like what he had to say. There were quite a few scenes of him being interviewed that had the ring of authenticity to them.",False

3,4,Not real but also not dishonest,umut-meier,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWe are guided into this Apaches' documentation through many interviews about him (real name Volkan) and his work and this is where my first point of criticism comes into play. These people are completely disillusioned and raise Apache to the level of a prophet with ""He revolutionized German rap"" and ""He's the only one who unites target groups"".I find this statement quite disrespectful towards other artists, although I don't listen to German rap like that. Yes, almost daft.In complete contrast to these statements, Volkan surprisingly draws a compeltely different picture. And here is, where the documentary has earned the additional stars. It's just good to see that this boy didn't become so big by chance (no pun intended), but that a lot was also planned and calculated. The whole environment helped him and made him thrive. He's a well-behaved boy and he shows it, despite the Rap Image. You have to give him credit for the fact that negative tones are also sounded and not everything is celebrated as awesome. But here, too, a lot of potential is wasted because, as I said, it is only hinted at. Not much is really real here. You have to read a lot between the lines and that ultimately results in the picture of the product ""Apache"". Neither human nor artist. Here, unfortunately, the documentary regularly thwarts itself, since there is a back and forth between intelligent monologue and completely thoughtless gibbergabber. I'll just say this much, 2 boys are sitting in the car and bragging and bullying about women. Typical rapper clich√©s.Now we come to the end and why I decided to write a long text after all. The film involuntarily shows that something is wrong with Apache in my opinion. In a video you can see that he performs and sings at the school dance prom. And no, he doesn't rap. He sings and it's fantastic. Then in the next cut comes the autotune distortion, which completely sells off his voice in his songs. Just because it works and the market demands it, Volkan and those around him developed this type of music. I hope that he chooses to change, despite of what he sings about.",True

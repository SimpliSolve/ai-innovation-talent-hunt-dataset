1,9,Stylistic Biopic of a Talented Trailblazer,zaidjasim,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've seen many sporting documentaries that pale in comparison to the sleek composition of this particular film. The protagonist herself exhibits an intellect far beyond her years, leading the way for all athletes worldwide, a shame they didn't include more of her early career as an early bloomer or any sort of convincing resolution with media, which left some open questions, otherwise a delightful watch born of the unique Norwegian cultural attitude.",False
2,10,Beautiful documentary,calvinharrisq,n/a,15/08/2025,"Quite informative and insightful. Never heard of her before just shows my ignorance about female footballers. The documentary shows the struggles she had to go through to become one of the best at 23 years old. Even though she didn't say all of them the part when she shows her scars in the treatment scene even when she says that a bone was outside the skin. Shows that she's not focusing on the awards, the pains, the struggles, the sexism. Those obstacles isn't going to stop her from reaching her full potential. It's very motivating i recommend this for everyone.",False

1,7,"One man, one camera, one background, many stories",rmgaspar-49er,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is simply famous Brazilian musician Caetano Veloso telling stories about when he was arrested by the right-wing dictatorship in Brazil (after 1968).""Nothing happens"", it's him speaking and storytelling.I am not a particular Caetano fan, unlike most Brazilians, but the documentary pleased me a good deal. How sincere and loose the conversation can get. The director was aiming at intimacy, and hits the nail. So, if you are interested in knowing how his mind was, prison conditions, how he connected to humanity in a solitaire, an intelligent mind connecting memories and emotions, it's definitely a hit.Obviously, if you expect Caetano singing, or sharing nice memories - (or even talking politics - you'll probably find your target somewhere else.It's not the purpose of the film, but maybe some archival footage could complement the stories well. I totally understand and like the angle taken, though.",False

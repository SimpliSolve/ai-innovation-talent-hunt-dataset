1,7,It's Cheers,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"Masamoto Ueda has been cooking at his tiny ramen noodle restaurant for forty years. Many of his customers are regulars who return constantly over the decades. It's not fancy but it's good eating. He has cooked the same noodles over the years.The perfect viewing experience would be watching this movie while eating the food. That's what is missing from this. We need to eat his food. It's great to see him make it. It's great to listen to people talk about eating it. I just need to taste it myself. They could do more about changes in the wider society and neighborhood over the years. It does go into his family life a bit. The change in '91 is a good episode. Basically, this place is Cheers where everybody knows your name.",False
2,10,A must-see for many reasons!,catnapbc,n/a,15/08/2025,"Whether you are a foodie, a Sino-phile, a wanna-be traveller or just want to be entertained, this delightful film has it covered. Apart from the fact that you get a flavour of both the actual food being made and served and see what it takes to run a tiny eatery, you also get a wonderful glimpse into Japanese life and social norms in a specific setting. The relationships and personal revelations of the customers, the owners and others involved is done with such respect and admiration, it's really a very unobtrusive way to get into the lives of certain people. You can sense the loneliness and need that some of these customers have and it's also clear this is a place that they come to for more than sustenance. It should be rated much higher than it is, but these days, few quiet and subtle shows seem to interest most people. If you want an endearing yet engaging film, watch this one. A true gem!!!",False
3,10,MUST SEE! Truly beautiful meditation on life and old Japan,Fiachy,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film was a pure joy. The kind of joy that makes you ache inside and shed some tears wondering where you have been living all this time. Wondering how you miss the beauty, simplicity and honourableness available to us all in this one radiant life. This movie captures the soul of community. It feels as warm and hearty as the ramen soup that is served.It has the feel of melancholy and nostalgia for a dying time. And a world of simplicity and straightforwardness that we have all but lost with our modern ways.It is cinematic soul food. And a very tasty Japanese kind. The kind that fills you with gratitude and sorrow at the same time. Go and watch this movie. See it alone, or see it with your friends, then go outside and enjoy your precious life.

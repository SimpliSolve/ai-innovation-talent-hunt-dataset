1,7,Cool adventure documentary,wgrhms,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's not an overblown action piece, but that's why I like it. Gives a cool peak into the ""treasure hunter's"" psyche and has some pretty funny moments. And the footage of the mountains is beautiful.",False
2,5,Mixed bag,aasthashah-62853,n/a,15/08/2025,"There were some aspects of the movie I really liked, especially the quirkiness of some characters and the fact that the movie was not dragged too much or the scenes weren't overdone. I think the storyline and the journey could have been better.",False
3,5,Mixed bag,aasthashah-62853,n/a,15/08/2025,"There were some elements of this movie that I liked, especially the quirk, but on how they show their journey, I thought the film could do better on that..overall I'm glad the adventure has not been overdone and I recommend a one time watch.",False
4,n/a,Other ratings are by single use accounts. Makers seem to have spent more time shilling than making this stinker,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I like quirky. But when it is forced and artificial, without any irony, it is just an awful pretense. And that is the sense one gets with this semi-mocumentary.And I mean the upshilling by single use accounts, giving this a 9 or 10, is desperate.",False
5,4,"well, the scenery is pretty",darazusa,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerJust another of the never ending stream of idiots, looking for a lie. Besides, you don't find gold bars in a mine! The dutchman was just a clever high-grader at the vulture mine. He hid what he stole somewhere very near my home, and morons have been stomping around ever since.",True
6,1,What a Bunch of ...,westsideschl,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a bunch of (putting it politely - dummkopfs) showing us what happens when you have too much time (and money) on your hands to fantasize on being the one finding the lost gold (and getting very rich).What you get in this pseudo doc: A bunch of old, mostly very overweight, males walking (more like stumbling) across an Arizona desert. A lot of sitting around a bar having some ""beverages"" sounding like graduating from middle school was a challenge. Digging a few holes making local critters happy that they don't have to do such mindless tasks. End of story. Oh, making up more fantasy that some unknown has recently beat them to the treasure - nothing resembling the slightest proof, of course.",False
7,2,Good news is we waste less time watching it than they did stumbling around,AngusMcK,n/a,15/08/2025,If you like to watch a group of the least mentally and physically equiped men stumbling around the superstitions on a wild goose chase then this is the show for you.,False
8,1,Nice scenery,borishum,n/a,15/08/2025,"Old, mostly very unfit and overweight males walking ( stumbling) across an Arizona desert. A lot of sitting around a bar having some ""beverages"" sounding like graduating from middle school was a challenge. Digging a few holes making local critters happy that they don't have to do such mindless tasks. End of story.",False
9,8,Seems plausible all possiblities!!,labboy-39057,n/a,15/08/2025,"I like the movie showed the raw footage of ups and downs of the dutchman gold. Best layed plans to go on the hunt can be ruined by one knotheaded person in the hunting party. Sad this happens but I think the heat and exhaustion play a big part why some people lose it and point fingers of blame as soon as nothing is found. Funniest part is when one guy accused the other ( I think. Bill K ) guy of digging. Up a planted shell casing, such a classic accusation I laughed my ass.off lol. But very intriguing and thought provoking as I have watch a lot of TV shows about superstition mountain.",False
10,9,Awesome adventure,danstratta,n/a,15/08/2025,"Living in Arizona myself and studying a lot about the superstitions this movie portrayed everything that it means to go into the superstition Mountains the anguish the hardships the love and the drive is still there to keep going, looking for that lost treasure to continue to do that Whatever it takes in their lust for gold.",False

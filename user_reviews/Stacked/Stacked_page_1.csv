1,3,Meh. Kept waitng for the big finish. Never delivered.,lochlemonde,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOutstanding production quality, well edited, but the story never grabbed me. Yeah there was a winner and loser at the end but I thought there was going to be some sort of fantastic finish. Spoiler alert. Dude misplays fly ball. I was waiting for some big dramatic, ball gets up the alley, close play at the plate, 17 pitch battle against the last batter. Nothing.Yeah I mean it does tell a winners and losers story. And it was in the state finals. But take away it being in the state finals and this happens thousands of times every year across the country. Not really why I would make a documentary about it. It would make a cool video for the banquet at the end of the season but to have this be on netflix? I don't really get it.",True
2,10,Old School Baseball in '99,mattgorske,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great story of two small town teams that meet up on a state championship stage. Both teams determined to win at all costs, not giving a second thought to their opponent.The HYPE production allows the audience to experience the nuances of each play through the perspectives of the players and coaches, transplanting you back to 1999 with raw, old school, VHS home video. The story is capped off with a dramatic, cinematic twist that seemingly only Hollywood could produce, keeping you on the edge of your seat!You will get to know the players and coaches personally, as they experience jubilation and devastation at the same moment in time. This 20+ year old story teaches a valuable lesson on how to handle success and overcome failure in life.",False
3,10,Outstanding!!,rscheske,n/a,16/08/2025,You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy the way this story is told. Several people have told me that they loved the documentary and don't even like baseball. There is so much going on you will want watch it more than once to see what you didn't pick up the first time. It is not surprising that this was an award winning documentary. Great for kids to see both sides of winning and losing. Life lesson can be learned as the story unfolds throughout the film. The presentation was well balanced from both teams perspectives and the impact it had on their lives personally. You will be glad you watched!!!,False
4,10,A trip down memory lane....,messner4442,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you grew up in the 80's and 90's, this is a trip down memory lane. Lots of fun.What kid who played baseball hasn't throw up a ball, and pretended it was a pop fly you had to catch to win State? Well, that really happens to some people, and the effects can last a lifetime.You don't have to be associated with this team or area to enjoy this doc, but it does add a dimension of enjoyability. If you have any experience with baseball, you'll love it. If you grew up around baseball you'll love it. It has all the elements you want from any great drama or documentary. Watch it with everyone in the family!I loved the lead in, the color, lighting, NOSTALGIA. Great debut!",False
5,10,Nostalgia and relevancy,keihlyh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I took my two young sons to watch this. I was a young teenager when this event occurred and remember all the town chatter from that time. Watching this with my two sons, also baseball players and athletes, and their attentiveness to the story was empowering for them. The drive these guys had together in 1999, the path they took as a team from even the young years is inspirational. Gave my sons perspective and mindset to chase with their own teammates at a young age. The film keeps your attention. Makes you laugh. Makes you feel nostalgic in one's own athletic adventures. Incredibly well done job by HYPE.",False
6,10,Gotta see Stacked!,lkolzow,n/a,16/08/2025,"Entertaining, blood sweat and tears of the making of a state championship baseball team. Why is it called stacked? Gotta see it to believe it. True baseball nostalgia. Loved it from the younger generation dreaming of their time to come to the older generation's past glory days. Loved seeing the communities come together to support the young athletes too. I was blown away at how entertaining as well as factual this Hype documentary is. If you are a sports fan or just remember the special relationships of being on a sports team, you will enjoy being transformed back to those memorable years. Stack this o e on top of the pile!!",False

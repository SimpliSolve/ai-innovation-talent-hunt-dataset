1,10,This is awesome. Every time I watch it I learn something new about the power of the Mind. Outstanding,annek-60865,n/a,16/08/2025,"I learned so much from watching this - just groundbreaking. Every student, parent, athlete should see it. In fact everyone from every walk of life. Real breakthrough!! Ten Stars!!!Found the movie gripping and kept thinking, what if this information was available in schools, universities. Everything would change so fast for the better. What I got out of it was you can learn what you want to happen fast, rather than spending years studying or struggling trying to make things happen. That is the way to go! The drama and the excitement kept me on the edge of my seat. Unmissable. Congratulations to all involved!!",False
2,5,Champion of the world Tony 'the delusional' Quinn.,itwengs,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI apologise as this is a review based only until Tony Quinn started trying to teach Collins the 'Star Wars' punch. This 'Dr' and 'expert in martial arts' came across more delusional than Steven Segal. The clip of him demonstrating this magic power on two martial arts actors was so pathetic I had to turn it off. He proceeded to flick them both in the chest with the back of his hand culminating in them writhing around on the floor pretending not to be able to get up. It begs the question, with so much godly power at his disposal, why was Quinn 'training' Collins at all and why didn't he fight Eubank for the purse?Why they included this clip in the documentary is beyond me and almost made a mockery of Collins' memorable victory.Before this the documentary was decent. Insights from Barry Hearn and Eubank himself built the scene and tension and the choosing of the venue was also insightful but, alas, enter the Dragon Quinn with his tom foolery and this bout ended there for me.",True

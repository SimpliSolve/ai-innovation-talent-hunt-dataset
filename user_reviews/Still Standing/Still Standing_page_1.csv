1,10,What a great summary of Aussie pinball history,tristandawson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Clearly put together huge swathes of passion for the silverball - Brad Gilbertson has done a fantastic job showcasing the modern rebirth of Pinball and Arcades across Australia along with enough detailed history & emotion to supercharge some passion to keep it ticking forward for the next generation.I absolutely loved the breakdown and exposure of what it means to own, run, repair and enjoy and Aussie Arcade. This documentary adds a layer of depth & emotion that I won't forget each time I visit one of the many pinball parlours around our country. Everyone who attends an arcade should watch out for the absolute legends showcased in this flick & give them a huge high five.Australia serving as the smaller and mostly unknown cousin to Americas pinball prowess over the decades wouldn't have been possible without the mammoths efforts put in by these blokes, their wives, children and communities behind them. Thanks to you all, and keep flippin.",False

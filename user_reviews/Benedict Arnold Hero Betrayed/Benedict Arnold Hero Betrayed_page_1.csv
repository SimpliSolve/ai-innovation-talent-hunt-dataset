1,6,I Don't Buy Their Central Premise.,jburtonprod-802-759029,n/a,17/08/2025,"Overall, this is a good documentary which shows Arnold's side of the story. It short changes everyone else, however.Yes, Arnold was a successful field commander but he was also full of pride and bitterness. The documentary makes it seem as if he was singled out by not being reimbursed for the money owed him but EVERY commander in the Continental Army was in similar circumstances, even George Washington.Arnold's many personal quarrels are glazed over as a lack of understanding 'politics'. I think Arnold's personal problems were far deeper rooted. One of Arnold's biggest problems was his refusal to follow orders. While this proved a virtue in some of his encounters it is impossible to run an army with officers who behave the way Arnold did.My guess is Ethan Allen, John Brown and General Gates all saw Arnold for who he was and he hated them for it.The depth of his treason against George Washington isn't really presented fully. His West Point plot may well have ended with Washington captured or killed by the British. This was after Washington had championed him, again and again. This would've been a crushing blow to the Continental Army and could've directly led to America's defeat.Arnold had been betraying America for almost a full year before he was caught. In that time he gave away detailed information about the Continental Army. This included troop and supply locations which probably caused many deaths. Then, once he joined the British, Arnold led raids against American cities, sacking them, leaving them in flames and plundered with many people killed.Yes, Arnold made many sacrifices to the 'cause' but so did others. None of them betrayed their country. Arnold did. Ultimately, he was not the 'man of honor' he so desperately tried to present to the world. He deserves his place in infamy.",False
2,5,"Benedict Arnold: a guy who gets screwed over at his job, then commits treason.",mattlucca,n/a,17/08/2025,"Benedict Arnold: a guy who gets screwed over at his job, then commits treason.Not great, a C level history channel type show. Was he a hero? Yeah, until he wasn't because he switched sides. You can do a lot of great things, but when you give up military information to the enemy it negates all your good works. This is a poorly titled movie, titled so, to get the attention of people who like contrarian views on history. It was mostly accurate, except for the guy who played Washington. The CG stuff was painful to look at. There is no new information here. Dumb.",False
3,5,"Deeply Flawed Individual, Not A Hero.....",Erik-Movie-Reviews,n/a,17/08/2025,"As another review points out, a contrarian / counter factual Documentary in the same vein as ""Why every house needs a Shark in their Bath Tub"" or ""Why Alligators Make Great Pets""Spoiler Alert - They Don't!Benedict Arnold was both Brave and a Talented military leader, but none of his accomplishments make up for his later treachery and deceit. If Benedict Arnold felt unappreciated and lacked confidence in his leadership, nothing prevented him from resigning and going his own way. Betraying his country and his countrymen was completely inexcusable, and any ridiculous narratives or documentaries to the contrary are completely absurd.",False
4,7,How history goes,sergelamarche,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is a bit of the truth coming out after centuries. Right from the start, the english so-called americans were not any better than the brits. The politics was just as rotten and back stabby. Greed and more power was the motivation of most. Jefferson wrote only a beautiful lie that they are still struggling to keep up today!",False
5,1,Not Good,demanbey,n/a,17/08/2025,Couldn't continue watching after the ridiculous and faulty representation of Arnold as the victim. Found nothing to be historically accurate so gave up watching.,False
6,8,A Solid Look at REAL History,asfhgwt-80792,n/a,17/08/2025,"For a low budget indie, this film does a great job of showing the importance of Arnold's many and crucial military contributions to the American Revolution. He was indeed a hero on the battlefield -- and his story is a far cry from the simplistic tale of treason spun by your history teachers. Watch it and learn something! (The only reasons I don't rate it a 10 are the choice of actor portraying Washington and some quibbles over a few minor details.)",False
7,2,Martin Sheen gets 2 stars - Not historically accurate and boring,therealdeviants,n/a,17/08/2025,"Documentaries on Arnold are usually very interesting because it is tragic due to his own self destruction.The tag line for this documentary did interest me. Does his heroics overshadow his treason, has history misjudged him.How this documentary approaches it is by omitting the treason down to a footnote in the presentation. At least go through the entirety of what the British were expecting and the desired outcome of the plan. Just because it failed does not mean it should be discounted against his great contributions.Even the coverage of his military career was slow and boring. Arnold's military career is anything but boring.",False
8,8,Benedict Arnold: Patriot or Patsy?,alphervs,n/a,17/08/2025,"There is a timeless theme to this presentation of Benedict Arnold's life. When the machinations of politics threaten a populist hero, what happens?This is a recurrent human struggle at least since the time of Christ.We never know who are those who betray us--Having grown up near the Saratoga Battlefield and Fort Ticonderoga, I was raised with the narrative that Ethan Allen saved the Revolution by taking Ticonderoga artillery to shell Boston--through the snow, and that Arnold was the consummate traitor.Now I have to question the narratives told in my primary school days with new information...information that as an educated adult I have to give some credence to. If you can't see the parallels to today's world, it is only to your detriment because you have not learned how we applaud some of the most treacherous people who affect our lives.",False

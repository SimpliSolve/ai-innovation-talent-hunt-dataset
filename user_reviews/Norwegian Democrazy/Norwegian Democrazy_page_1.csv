1,n/a,Deeply politically biased norwegian propaganda,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe title alone hooked me. Of course the translation is a little different and really this is a generic attack on the other side of political ideologies.Lets just say its very polarizing. Pretty much the same media presentations paid for by global ideological machines with shared interests. All it does is convince you that the islamisation of well face it the world due to terror conflict and radical islam is a real thing.Some say hey we might get some baddies amongst all those innocent want to change sincere so and so.In the doc typical islam demonstrations can be seen. This isn't where people of islam or who perhaps worship as muslims are simply saying we love our new home we love our new melting pot... these are the typical we got in and now we want you to change to suit us.They hold flags of their former states and their true allegiances. The state of islam.So is it really automatically racist to speak openly and honestly about such instances or protestors their aims purpose and beliefs?Meanwhile a domestic person can now be placed under caution for free speech that protects better in one direction than the other.Its really governments who know they have perpetuated global instability in regions. They now only have to slowly seed strong populations with adversarial sources of conflict.That divides the population which is what stands against governments complete dominance.Once divided the local population of voters further divided by ever radicalized divisive politics between the right and left are led to believe they are winning more than ever by being in the fight of their lives supplanting natural instincts and drives with some misguided political war game fantasy fiction.In reality this is just more of the same spending.What people know is its best or more cost effective to push this shovel ware media mentality over trying to convince people as individuals or in person.Vague droning perceptions and repeated half truths sell far better than the whole truth and taking the time to engage with others who might see things differently.Oh and i almost forgot prepare to enjoy subtitles and the usual awkward translation gap between the two languages.,True

1,5,Important Subject but project poorly produced,willfant,n/a,16/08/2025,"As important as this topic is and the guests who appeared did their best, the film loses momentum fast.Imagine you walk into a convention where you're excited for not only the topic but for the expert presenters who are going to appear and speak on something they've studied, researched and or directly experienced. And just as things get started, overwhelmingly loud, bad and distracting music begins playing in and starts to over pace the sound of the guest speaker, while large projectors of b-roll and graphics begin to appear in the background.Then a host appears every 2 minutes on stage with a dialogue that inserts itself as a secondary commentary and narration for filler between acts. Except it appears the host themselves is the main act.The actual speakers or guests are given some time, but not nearly enough. Still, you hope to see more of them but instead are being forcibly ""entertained"" by the flashing lights, off paced music and very off - putting b roll that is projected from every screen.Sorry, but this production had cheesy and awfully redundant prod-values, as well, it had a knock off vibe of the ""The Secret"", except it doesn't even come close.I'm sure they put a lot of hard work into this but I can't help but think this was a vanity project of some sort and no restraint was shown. It's like they stored up content graphics for years and then used every element of it at every turn. It feels disjointed and chaotic and not entertaining though I did enjoy James Van Prague who offers a brief reprieve to an otherwise fragmented and disjointed production.",False
2,10,"Excellent documentary, will be watching it again",admin-60427,n/a,16/08/2025,Very informative and education documentary that is factual and concise. I learned a lot from watching it about there being a very strong possibility that there is no death and that life goes on after death.The documentary gave me a lot of comfort and opened my eyes to the fact that we have so much to learn and so little to fear when it comes to the taboo subject of death. I think this documentary should be shown at schools for the older students to learn from. Humanity can only progress once we have conquered our fears and embraced the truth. This documentary encompasses the truth and it is presented in a subtle and cohere manner everyone can enjoy and understand.,False
3,1,I love a good ghost story...,coressler,n/a,16/08/2025,"...this movie seems to have plenty, but I couldn't make it more than 20 minutes. Tried to tolerate the host, the bad audio, and even worse editing choices but it never got better. The host's wide eyed facial expressions and overly enthusiastic tone of voice come off kind of cartoonish creating a strange feeling of dissonance between her and the topics being discussed. Sound effects and background music frequently over power the volume of the people recounting their stories. The editing choices and quality are just... bad. It's poorly made which is a shame because the idea is there, it's just hard to watch. With how all over the place it is - makes me wonder if the intention was to hold the attention of a younger audience?",False
4,10,Brilliant!,delphinecopeland,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this documentary! Informative, interesting, amazing! For anyone interested in the concept of an afterlife, I would implore you to watch. It's totally brilliant from start to finish. The documentary is well produced and full of interesting facts, clips and interviews. I literally could not tear my eyes away from it!For anyone who cares to research, there is a massive body of evidence out there to support the continuation of consciousness after the death of the physical body. I feel that this wonderful documentary contributes and adds an extra layer to such evidence.An absolute 'must watch!'",False
5,1,It'd be laughable if it weren't so insulting,bowoman,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's horrifying -- and not in the way you were hoping for. Most prominent are the terrible production values coupled with a goofy narrator who has sadly mistaken the serious -- and, poignant -- topic as an audition for Maybelline mascara.It's devoid of anything that vaguely resembles scientific research and looks more like an episode of Clutch Cargo. What a waste of time.As another reviewer pointed out, this travesty sets the topic back decades. Even the few snippets of halfway interesting footage can't redeem Ghosts and the Afterlife. There's not enough lipstick in the world to pretty up this pig.",False
6,10,Loved this film,proofoflifemarket,n/a,16/08/2025,"So informative, loved the clips, loved the info presented by actual doctors, mediums and even famous actors. Very informative and enjoyed very much. James Van Praagh is a wonderful throwback along with Raymond Moody. The host is a sweet and lovely girl with many delightful wardrobe changes. My husband and I enjoyed a nice evening with done snacks, drinks by the fireplace watching this film and made it a nice, quiet date night! Was just the right amount of l time length. Including some interesting videos of actual spirit communication and contact and it made it very interesting to hear from doctors in the field giving more confirmation. I already know from past experiences that the afterlife is real, it's really nice to hear from professionals in the field confirming it though!",False
7,1,"Mix between low budget, 90s graphics and incredible information",cpgklein,n/a,16/08/2025,"How was this documentary made in 2022?? The graphics is straight out of the early 2000s. The soundtrack sounds like it belongs in a 1990s elevator (lift). Add that with some of the latest most advanced scientific information and you have yourself ""Ghosts and the Afterlife"".After watching this documentary I am eagerly waiting for AI to take over this industry cause goodness gracious me, humans failed this one...ADDITIONAL NON-SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: They mention all of the MDs and PHD that will feature in the documentary but in the end their input was minimal with most of the focus on Hollywood.",False
8,10,An Amazing Compilation of Valauble Information,mikeailes,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just saw this film today. If you are looking for a film that follows men walking around in the dark with thermometers looking for ghosts; then, this would not be for you. However, if you are looking for a movie with genuine and relevant story lines replete with scientific data to back it up; then, this is exactly what you would be looking for.The movie combines historical events and science with beautifully presented data based on scientific studies that prove the existence of consciousness beyond the physical body and how this experience can be explained from an empirical perspective.While the discussions related to physics and various research studies may be too intellectual for some to understand, there is plenty of information presented that anyone can understand.The experts in this film were the cream of the crop when it comes to paranormal and after death experiences. I truly enjoyed the film and I would recommend watching it more than once as it has a great deal of esoteric information that takes time to assimilate.",False
9,4,"Loved the subject, but why cheese it up with a Barbie model narrator?",CindySW4,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was immediately drawn to the subject matter of this documentary. But very quickly all credibility vanished with the scantily-clothed beautiful model/host and her attempts at handling subject matter as serious as life/death and the afterlife.All I can imagine is one of the producers or writers said ""I've got this gorgeous girl who will probably date me if I can get her this gig""
That is about as serious as anyone could ever take her presence in what could have been a GREAT documentary. The science and the experts were great; the research done was really interesting...but the tank-top wearing college girl? Just RUINED all the credibility this documentary could have had. Why not a narrator with experience or knowledge on the subject?There's no need for ""eye candy"" with a subject this serious and life changing.",False
10,9,Really Liked this movie,marshawashington-64701,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really liked this movie, but a few of the scenes really scared me. Maybe I'm too sensitive. Whatever, I liked it. A lot of interesting stuff and a lot of new things I never thought or heard of. I hope there is some kind of sequel.Everything I saw looked realy interesting from the beginning to the end of the movie. I liked the little girl narrating it too. The WW2 soldier was really good as well. All in all, I think this is a very good movie, so I gave it a 9. The part on invisibility, the NASA stuff, the secret experiments done by the government, the after-death experiences, were all really interesting. I don't know what else to say.Thanks for reading this.",False
11,1,Terrible production quality - interesting information,maryshannon-18223,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is so poorly produced that I had to check the date to make sure it wasn't from the 80s. Interesting information, but the strangest choices on wardrobe, casting, interview locations, graphics, editing, music etc. Stock footage selects that don't work. Animated number countdowns that eat up a bunch of time for no reason. Audio quality is all over the place and on and on.I think this deserves a remake - credible sources are overshadowed by strange production choices. The show host in front of a green screen with animations going on in the background with a visible green light cast around her - wearing a strange red dress and barefoot.Its so odd... and such a shame.",False
12,1,Worst production ever,teaching-18781,n/a,16/08/2025,"So disappointed in every aspect, great idea, interesting people but the worst music, imagery, made it so cheesy. No editors over 7. I really had high hopes for the documentary. I seriously have never seen such a poor compilation of information. I fear it will further the inability of great, research-based stories, data, and helpful information by experts. You just disrespected every single contributor to this project! The host made a few major grammatical errors, hung instead of hanged, and the hole just kept getting deeper and wider of the void of good, credible and thoughtful movie making. Just poor, so poor.",False
13,8,Good movie,chrismichaels-95444,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really liked it. A lot of good information. I didn't like the girl's dress speaking as a fashion designer, I think it could have been a bit longer and a different color. Also, she changed her clothes so often, it made my head spin. And, maybe, it would have been a good idea to have a man narrate the film to give it more authority. Just saying that's my opinion. Of course, there was a large number of male contributors in the expert category. Also, in some scenes she wasn't even wearing shoes, which i guess is OK. Bottom line, i really liked the movie, so in the long run, I wold recommend it with 8 stars.-Mike.",False
14,1,Nothing scientific about this show.,RickLWright,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just people telling ghost stories. The narrator is cute but far too perky for the subject matter and her vocal fry is off the charts. Hard to listen to. The show uses stories of ancient philosophers as if they were fact. There are a few nearth death out of body experience stories. Ghost hunters jumping at every noise. Waste of time. They use mediums as if that's science. They use as an example of proof of ghosts cell phones and oxygen. You cant see oxygen but it exists, therefore ghosts exist. That's not science. Feelings ate not science. Also there is a ton of wasteful filler shots just to pad the show.",False
15,8,My Thumbs are up and I rate it 8 stars.,margaretadams-55871,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the second review I have ever posted. Although I may not be a Siskel or an Ebert, I do know a lot about this subject matter.The interviews are fantastic. James Van Praagh, without question, does the best interview I have ever seen him do and, as I am an ardent fan of ""Ghost Whisperer"" and James in general, I know what I am talking about.Raymond Moody does a great job as well.There was a whole list of fascinating topics and new discoveries. The list of experts, unlike any movie I have ever seen on the subject, in addition to Dr. Moody and James Van Praagh, the movie included Dr. Vernon Sylvest, Dr. Kenneth Rose, Dr. Jeffrey Rediger, Dr. Norm Shealy, and Captain Frederick ""Skip"" Atwater. Captain Atwater was the operations officer in charge of the top-secret military StarGate program.There is a lot more, but I just got through watching it for the first time.The NASA experiments, the experiments creating invisibility, and the top-secret research done on consciousness detached from the physical body were all fascinating.",False
16,2,Abysmal production,xalex90x@excite.com,n/a,16/08/2025,"While the subject matter and individuals interviewed are compelling, the editing, effects, and overall production value of this documentary are so unbelievably bad that it makes your average Youtube vlog look like Citizen Kane. Any credibility afforded by its subjects' doctoral credentials is immediately discarded by this shoddy, sloppy, poorly-made, sad excuse for a film.Topics like NDEs, quantum mechanics, psychic phenomena, and the cultural history of ghosts will continue to be the subject of ridicule if movies like this are the only sources discussing them. Hopefully a competent team of filmmakers will tackle these ideas in something worth watching but until then please avoid this trash.",False
17,10,Great movie!,bermanshelly,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the first review I have ever written; so, I hope it doesn't sound too goofy.This documentary has really opened my mind to an entire new world of possibilities and discovery.The movie covers not only the scientific studies that support the existence of the afterlife but also the historical and very credible personal experiences of several interviewees and medical doctors.I would say that anyone interested in delving into the probabilities of life after death that they should definitely watch this film.I had no idea that 90 percent of what I learned from watching this film even existed. I think anyone with an ounce of curiosity would truly enjoy and learn from this film.",False
18,1,"""A scientific investigation"" part of the tile was forgotten",Dzyak,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe production design and overall style are an absolute mess. Poorly framed and lit interviews... poor non-professional audio ... non-cohesive ""segments""... cheap graphic bumpers ... no discernible format for the show whatsoever. It's less ""documentary"" and more ""sensational reality show.""The host segments against the blue screen (with a questionable newsroom backdrop) have very poor camera operating work. For some reason, she/they decided that changing her wardrobe midway through the documentary would be a good idea.The host, while enthusiastic about the topic, sets an inappropriate mismatched tone for the topic of the documentary and she becomes the focus rather than the ""expert"" interviewees.Most importantly, there is a distinct lack of scientific evidence, meaning, no repeatable data. A lot of opinions, interviewees with anecdotes and ""I think that"" statements.She equates the ""invisible magic"" of cell phones with ghosts, because ""we can't see the energy that makes phones work."" But we know exactly how cell phones work. It isn't a mystery and we CAN measure the energy that makes the technology work. Not with our eyes, but with other instruments. Her attempt to justify the existence of ghosts by equating their ""invisible"" nature with cell phone signals instantly negates ANY credibility of logic she and the show may have had.This isn't to say I'm disputing any of the anecdotal stories of ghosts or their out-of-body experiences told by the interviewees. I've had several unexplainable experiences myself. It's just that anecdotes aren't scientific evidence and the TITLE OF THE SHOW literally says ""A scientific investigation."" I'd expect to see devices measuring fluctuations on the EM spectrum to correlate with visual or auditory experiences with ghosts.At 50 minutes in, she goes on a monologue with random scientific terms and even e=MC2 tossed in alongside gravity and string theory, I suppose to make it sound scientific... like, okay maybe now we'll get to the ""A scientific investigation"" portion of the show. But what follows is a questionable exploration of ""consciousness"" with more mere opinions from poorly shot interviews. No science, just more irrelevant history and opinionated conjecture.(Some free advice from a thirty+ year camera professional for the sequel: Don't put your talent up against a wall. Use a key light just to the left or right of lens for males and put the key light over the lens for females. Maybe try 23.98fps as opposed to the 29.97 you did use, which is what we see when watching local news and soap operas. From the interviews to the host segments to the b-roll choices... everything about this screams amateur.)She tries to draw a connection between String Theory and ghosts, but her statement is full of conjecture and philosophy. Again, no actual science. Just more ""I believe that..."" statements.What does ""Remote Viewing"" have to do with the scientific investigation of ghosts?The description on Amazon Prime says ""A definitive film based on 12 years of investigations exploring the subject of the afterlife.""First of all, it isn't film. They shot on video at 29.97fps which adds to the cheesy non-authoritative nature which hurts its credibility. And where did the number 12 come from? It implies that the producers literally spent 12 years compiling extensive research before crafting it into a 71 minute comprehensive documentary which would provide peer-reviewed data driven scientific research. None of that is evident in any of the 71 minutes.The description continues: ""The existence of ghosts is a real phenomenon.""No, it isn't, at least from a scientific standpoint as offered by this program which provides zero peer-reviewed data to support this statement. It's 71 minutes of conjecture and disjointed history and anecdotes which provide unsupported opinions.Continuing: ""Scientific research...""Which the producers clearly never encountered in their 12 years of investigations because none of it is included in this documentary.Continuing: ""...historical evidence and first-hand accounts prove that our souls...""Anecdotes are not scientific evidence that prove anything.You get the idea. A ""documentary"" (I use that term very loosely here) that sells itself as ""A scientific investigation"" should contain actual scientific investigation, not mere anecdotes, opinions, and conjecture.That was a waste of 71 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. I can only assume it won an award at the Tarzana Film Festival because no one else entered. This show is an embarrassment to the medium of television, the genre of documentary, to the actual scientific community, and to those involved in putting this disaster together. I can only assume that it was a vanity project or some kind of money laundering operation which compelled them to invest time into this thing because it certainly wasn't about proving the existence of ghosts.",True
19,10,Congratulations on a fantastic film!,photographybycristal,n/a,16/08/2025,I love it! I rate it 10 stars! It is my JOY to be here! It is scary at times! I love all the interviews! The girl commentator is beautiful!It is fascinating to know there is so much scientific proof of LIFE after life! We live in strange and uncertain times. We all want to know if there is more to life! I have watched it three times now and I pre-ordered the DVD version so that I can keep it in my collection. It is both a learning and a spiritual experience! There is so much stuff in this film that I never thought of before! This is a must-see film for anyone interested in ghosts and the afterlife!,False
20,1,Could not finish it and I finish everything!,sotos38,n/a,16/08/2025,"I do not understand the viewers who gave this film 9 or 10 stars, like have they ever seen anything on afterlife? Maybe because as a Wiccan I am a firm believer in life after death and all matter being energy I might have had too high expectations, but I was not able to to finish the entire movie due to many factors. One of them being the major cringe factor caused by the main host's completely inappropriate demeanor and overly bright smile that almost felt creepy considering the subject and would have been better suited to host a game show or kids program. The background music was too loud and the graphics so bad I had to check the production year as I got major ""Unsolved Mysteries"" vibes. Not one of the video clips were new and anyone that has an interest in the supernatural has seen them all.I can't judge whether or not it is a waste of your time or worth watching as it depends on how much you value your time. There are however many much more professional documentaries out there.It's a real shame though because the idea and theory is very interesting and plausible and should be pursued further, but hopefully processed and produced better.",False
21,10,Terrific!,eddiethemandude,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want a terrific and informative documentary on the subject of the afterlife, this would be a good film to watch.It covers the subject of ghosts as the ghosts are part of the afterlife conundrum, but mostly focuses on historical and scientific data related to the afterlife and how exactly such a phenomenon can possibly exist.The movie's production values and the on-camera narrator (Kelsey) are all excellent.Some of the most fascinating topics covered were: (1) a test of a loss of consciousness via a NASA Centrifuge to prove the continuation of consciousness even after all the blood was drained from the pilots' brains (2) the projection of consciousness over thousands of miles in a research project executed by the U. S. government in the once top-secrete Stargate program; (3) The scientific creation of invisibility; (4) the capture of a 3D spectral manifestation on video; (5) the discussion of the String theory versus quantum theory and how the two might interact with alternate dimensions and; (6) the fact that all the experts interviewed are either PhDs or medical doctors speaking from their experiences and research and who are recognized as the foremost experts in the area of afterlife research.I also loved Jay Thomas' segments. He is such a great artist. There was also an entertaining segment where they gathered the general public's positions on the subject matter of ghosts. All and all, a terrific and informative documentary!Thank you, Hollywood Picture Studios!!!",False
22,1,The biggest disservice to the field in years,anders-915-6958,n/a,16/08/2025,"I rented this movie on Vimeo after hearing the producer Steve Sayre being interviewed by Kirsty Salisbury on her podcast Let's Talk Near Death.I am the kind of person who firmly believes in an afterlife. I read books, listen to podcasts, watch documentaries and so on for hours each week and has done so since 2017.Let me just say this: I feel bad for the people telling their, probably true, stories in this movie. I can't believe that high profile people like James Van Praagh and Dr. Raymond Moody lended their credit to this film by appearing in it.This film makes the whole field, all the research and science being put into it, look like a bad joke.It includes low resolution green screen backdrops of ""fabulous locations"" behind people being interviewed, 1990s like animated sequences illustrating out of body experiences and spooky, scary, haunting sound effects to take away any sense of the production being serious.I couldn't believe my eyes when the narrator, Kelsey Bohlen, first came on screen in a tight, short dress addressing the topic of the afterlife with a never ending fake Hollywood smile. I'm sure she's a nice person but her appearance and demeanor are so out of place in a production like this. It looks like she's hosting the latest season of Bachelorette or Temptation Island.The film uses the absolute worst kind of cheesy stock footage to illustrate the stories being told, resulting in me as a viewer totally losing focus on the story and just shaking my head in utter disbelief of why any producer would ever make this choice instead of just pointing the camera at the person telling their story.To top it all off, if you've seen any other documentaries about the subject of the afterlife, this film doesn't bring anything new to the table.It makes everything about the afterlife look fake and it is a great disservice to anyone who does serious work trying to prove the existence of life after death.Watch at your own peril.",False
23,10,Great Film!!!,misssusananderson,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this film!!! So many different ideas I never thought of and so much information I have never seen or heard of before.I am surprised that some people are upset about the hostess' dress or the film's set. The set was amazing and the girl's dress was just fine (all six of them--she changed her wardrobe a lot). She's a pretty girl.There were so many fascinating facts presented in this movie.The discussion on the origins of consciousness, the NASA Centrifuge experiment, the historical presentations, the Stargate program, the invisibility segment, and so many other things.If you have interest in the subject matter, you should definitely see this film!",False

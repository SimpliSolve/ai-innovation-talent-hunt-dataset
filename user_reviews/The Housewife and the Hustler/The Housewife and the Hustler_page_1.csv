1,5,Gross human beings,garnet-suss,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had never heard of these people before. I decided to watch this because of the allegations that they stole settlement money from accident victims.What a couple horrid and tacky people who have done some incredibly selfish and terrible things.Not a very good documentary, it's basically a video version of a gossip column. It's like a train wreck, you just can't look away, even though watching it makes you feel like a piece of trash.",False
2,7,Eye opening,moagley,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched as a fan of RHOBH and of Erika. But WOW this was absolutely insane. The things that Tom Girardi did were so unbelievably shocking, at least for those of us whose impression of him is shaped around the Bravo show. Erika has always been private, so this was eye opening to say the least. Loved every minute.",False
3,2,Made Me Even More Angry,iheartkatherine-63006,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI thought I would see that justice had been done but not even close! The title is a bit deceiving, I agree with the reviewer that mentions this and they are right.....more info on victims which would be fine if there was more information on the penalties or repercussions that this former attorney and his real housewife deserves. There is no way Erika didn't know what was going on and why are they discussing Alzheimer's and Dementia, those are serious illnesses that should not be ""excuses"" for the attorney stealing their own clients settlement funds. Shame on them!!!!!! Just don't watch unless you don't care about justice because this is just a bunch of junk if you take out the stories of the victims. Those were helpful and my heart goes out to the victims.",True
4,10,Well Done Documentary,angelicacamaron,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTom and Erika Girardi are the worst of the worst. Vile creatures, who lived a life of excess beyond their means--on victims' dimes. They are snakes who slithered under a faux veil of wealth. I'm disgusted by what I learned in the doc. One could almost say Tom wanted to appease his much younger attractive wife and was willing to pay *any* price to be able to keep her on his arm--no fool but an old fool, right? Except his misdeeds weren't just during their marriage. The California Bar allowed him to get away with criminality for 40 years--complaints were dismissed, swept under the rug. Yes, they are culpable, too. They should be brought in front of a judge and be forced to provide compensation to the victims. As far as Erika goes, I hope she ends up broke and working as cocktail waitress in a dive bar. I feel so bad for the victims who were cheated! And shame on Bravo. You know they are rubbing their hands together gleefully over how ratings will go through the roof. I'll never watch a Real Housewife episode again.",True
5,3,More like Mr and Mrs Hustler,TheTruthofItIs,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary makes it clear that famed-to-disgraced civil attorney Tom Girardi is a pyramid-scheming fraudster. However though it tries but fails in making the case against his wife, Erika, and fails to explain why Tom hasn't even been criminally charged yet! So this documentary is really only half-baked.",False
6,4,4 ONLY FOR THESE HORRIBLE VICTIMS,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"1st-this podcast host, Danielle? What a horrible human being. I don't know what her deal is, but her alignment with Erica (or whatever her name is) is apparent and 'protecting' her is just gross.2nd-claiming Erica was some 'young, hot' singer? Just NO. She was old and looked like a pancake spackle with plaster. She had zero talent and was funded completely by her husband.3rd-STOP MAKING SUNNY HOSTERT RELEVANT! She's a gossip columnist with a law degree AT BEST. She's not injecting legalese, she's injecting OPINION, and a severely slanted one, at that.4th-all of these people, the 'real housewives' included, are garbage human beings. Anyone who willfully indulges these frauds as 'celebrities' needs to seek help- our standard for celebrity has fallen woefully into the gutter, and that 'we' elevate this trash to anything other than the care of a psychologist is disgusting.Erica was MARRIED to Tom, and to my understanding, California (a garbage dump of a state) has communal property, and as there was no prenuptial, they're bound together by that law.The state of California bar association mucked this up horrendously, letting these VICTIMS swim in their debt despite numerous red flags being waved in their face; I sincerely hope the bar association is hauled into court along with Girardi and Erica. This is malpractice at the very least.Erica IS FIFTY YEARS OLD for sobbing out loud, not that cute, and every dime she's making from that horrendous show needs to go to the victims.This entire show feels icky-I feel as if I need a shower to clean myself from this filth. It plays like a cheap gossip show with all these odd pauses for dramatic effect when there's real people whose lives were absolutely destroyed, and then destroyed again by this malcontent and his vapid wife who had no issues with taking his unearned money for her nonsensical behavior.",False
7,2,Title and description are a little deceiving in my opinion.,itsamandacrispino,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was mostly victims telling their stories. If that's not what you're wanting to watch, I'd pass on this. Title and description are a little deceiving in my opinion.",False

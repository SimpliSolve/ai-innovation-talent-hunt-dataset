1,7,"A Polished, Flattering Doc",Sil-Azevedo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is very well-made tribute documentary by two Oscar-level filmmakers. It's a celebration of the remarkable life of a pioneer. DVF is an inspiring figure who had the courage to live fully and now celebrates her victories. This film reflects that. But it could be so much more, if the filmmakers had the will and power to deviate from the flattering narrative a little and bring forth the humanity behind the icon. At one point we see Diane interacting with one of the filmmakers behind the cameras and saying ""you're the director."" This reality-tv-like moment is meant to ease our suspicion that the subject had a say in the outcome of the film, but if anything, it reveals that the filmmakers were very much aware of the adulatory nature of the project and wanted to show that it was not so. Still worth a watch, given the fascinating story. Just keep your critical eye out to see the hidden layer behind the polished veneer.",False
2,9,Amazing woman,Missyrocks,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really didn't know much about her. This woman has had an unbelievable life, and she is an amazing, complex woman. This is very well done and explores a woman with an unbelievable amount of self-made success. Overcoming odds at every turn in so many ways.Her childhood is quite sad, but she is the daughter of a woman clearly suffering from trauma from her horrific past. DVF is quite open about her life, and it explores how she seems to repeat much of the same pattern with her own children of what she suffered. She appears very much made at peace with and does not dwell in what fundamentally shaped her entire life- the complex relationship with her mother.She clearly has done everything on her own terms, and has adapted her mother's attitude toward everything, which is to be singularly in survival mode. Fascinating life worthy of this doc.",False
3,10,Are You a Woman in Charge?,marciafinebooks,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you need inspiration, this film takes you to some high places. True, we can't all marry a prince; however, we can all aspire to be more, especially if you were brought up in the Baby Boomer era. We had some tough rules: be a virgin when you get married; don't get a bad reputation by sleeping around; dress modestly or guys will think you're fast, etc. Diane broke all of them and boy, did she have fun! She also learned a lot, created two beautiful children and tapped into her creativity to become a woman whose taste is known world-wide. Have you seen the spread in ""Town & Country"" about her home in Venice?! I loved this biopic and highly recommend it, especially if you're a woman who harbors ambitions and enjoys motherhood.",False
4,9,Fascinating Subject Told Well,fayandray,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am 51F. Diane Von Furstenberg has been an inspiration my whole life. Yet, I knew nothing about her, except the pics of her at Studio 54.I have loved and owned her dresses. So I was ready to get into this documentary. I was pleasantly surprised by everything technical about it. It's beautifully shot and well-edited, so as to be paced just right. I love how deep they dig, but I wish they expanded on it a bit. Maybe it lacks clarity in the timeline of her life, but that's nothing that can't be solved by reading.Ultimately, this is a hugely positive doc about a complex subject. She is of her time and place, but also timeless in that she is who she's always been. I respect her more now, knowing the roadblocks she faced back then (women weren't even allowed credit cards without a husband or father co-signing!).This doc manages to go through the whole of a fascinating life without seeming to hide anything. For the watchlist of anyone into fashion, feminism or even history.",False

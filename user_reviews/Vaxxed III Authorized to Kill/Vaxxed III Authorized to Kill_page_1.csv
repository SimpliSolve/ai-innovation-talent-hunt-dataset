1,1,another sad example of desinformation,mattbermondsey,n/a,16/08/2025,"""the blind leading the blind"". That is the absolute best way to describe this ""piece"". I won't even use the word ""documentary"" as a documentary normally contains scientific elements or at least research elements where Vaxxed III clearly doesn't. It was already the case for Vaxxed I and II.People should not forget the whole Vaxxed saga was created by a disgraced doctor, Andrew Wakefield, famous for his biased and incorrect researches, whose sole purpose was to profit from his incorrect researches.Since his incorrect allegations, it has been officially proved that vaccines have no links to autism.Wakefield was found to be guilty of conflict of interest, which he clearly failed to mention to anyone as his research was secretly funded by personal-injury lawyers whose clients were suing MMR vaccine makers.We might ask ourselves : with such a terrible reputation, how come Vaxxed created such momentum among a certain part of the community back in 2016? The answer is as terrible as the facts : uneducated or non-medical people look for easy answers to complex questions. And M. Wakefield provides just that : poorly researched information, non-scientific evidence and. A clear penchant for dramatized storytelling were enough to create doubt with a community of ill-equipped fear-mongering, anti-big Pharma people.Let's not forget this Vaxxed ""saga"" has blood on its hands : how many people could have been saved if they had received proper immunity regarding Covid or other diseases?This saga is a testimony to remind us all that disinformation is one of the biggest threats ever and it has already cost the lives of millions of people around the world.People should educate themselves !",False
2,10,Heartbreaking information.,bizzyziggy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I see Big Pharma already has their minions doing hit pieces. Another review on here refers to autism. This Documentary has nothing to do with that. This has to do with the COVID Vaccinations and Remdesivir and Ventilators.This is not about a doctor. This is about the survivors and their stories about surviving the injuries of COVID Vaccinations and Remdesivir. This is about the surviving family members of a loved one who died from the COVID Vaccinations and Remdesivir. These are people and their stories. Also behind the scenes information on the money that was made by this Tragedy.So ask yourself, why would anyone want to shut up the voices of survivors?",False
3,7,"""Vaxxed 3"" alleges harm from COVID vaccines and hospital treatments",Morpheus7,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSpurning information about COVID from the CDC and top government officials, Vaxxed 3 chronicles a 50,000-mile, cross-country bus tour that interviewed hundreds of people claiming to be seriously injured by the COVID vaccine and/or hospital treatments.""The government was lying, the media was lying, and they're still lying,"" Ryan Cole, MD, said in the film. ""Only the people will tell us the truth,"" added Polly Tommey, executive producer.Traveling from city to city, the producers found no shortage of people to give testimonials of injuries after the COVID vaccine.""Everything was fine before we got the shots,"" said a man who took two COVID shots. ""This is the fourth time I've had COVID...Why did I get COVID four times if I got something that's supposed to stop it?""""I spent 31 months sitting in an infusion center getting IVIG-that's intravenous immunoglobulins-just where I could do my everyday living,"" one woman said.""She was in the bed for basically a year before she could actually talk and be present,"" said a husband about his wife. ""She would have anywhere from 15 to 30 mini-seizures throughout the day.""Other reported post-vaccine illnesses included myocarditis, blood clots, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and aggressive cancers.""Normal cancers, prior to a couple years ago, for as long as we've known about cancers, are slow to develop,"" said David Rasnick, who has a PhD in chemistry with over 20 years experience in cancer research. ""These mRNA and DNA vaccines are genetic injections (that) are devastating the immune system...Once your immune system is really really depressed, now these (tumors) can develop rapidly.""Testimonials also came from parents and other relatives of people who died shortly after taking the COVID vaccine.""My wife has passed away, and the doctors attributed her passing away to getting the vaccine,"" said one.""He received a (first) shot for COVID on Friday...and was found dead on Sunday,"" said a man about his stepbrother.""The story is really short,"" one woman said about her sister. ""She takes the shot. That's it. Ten days later, she's dead.""By scientific standards, these interviews are anecdotal and not suitable for any statistically significant conclusions. For example, the testimonials don't refute the CDC's publicly available data regarding serious events and deaths following COVID vaccines (138,000 and 22,000, respectively, as of September 2024).The testimonials do, however, create a contrast with the frequently aired ""safe and effective"" video messages from Biden, Trump, Harris and Fauci, which the movie replays for reference.Vaxxed III also shows many testimonials (selected from ""hundreds and hundreds"" of people, Tommey said) of hospital maltreatment.""My mom was murdered by the hospital COVID protocols,"" said a nurse. ""They just unleashed a series of protocols and gave her Remdesivir against her will and did all kinds of things against her will. So the whole time I was fighting to get in to save my mother...I am completely capable of saving her, and they would not let me in.""""We had several new dialysis patients admitted to our clinic who had been hospitalized with COVID,"" a nurse said. ""And they were told in the hospital that COVID had shut down their kidneys. But by that time I was pretty savvy and I knew what was happening. They were getting Remdesivir, the drug that some nurses call Run-Death is Near, and that was shutting down their kidneys.""Some accounts even suggest intentional harm. Scott Schara took his daughter in the hospital to help treat a mere cold, but during her short stay ""she died of acute respiratory failure with hypoxemia."" Without his knowledge, Schara said, the hospital administered the drug Precedex for ""five full days,"" even though the drug's package insert said it causes respiratory failure after 24 hours. The hospital also secretly placed a ""do not resuscitate"" order on her chart, he added. When his daughter's condition became severe and the family ""started screaming, 'Save our daughter,'"" the staff refused because of the DNR order, Schara said.Although testimonials like these won't find their way into scientific journals, Vaxxed III also reviews scientific reports comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. ""The unvaccinated were always coming back healthier,"" said Brian Hooker, PhD, who, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., co-authored the New York Times bestseller Vax-Unvax: Let the Science Speak.""Now that we've got a handful of studies comparing vaxxed and unvaxxed, we now know, without a doubt, that things like neurodevelopmental concerns, learning disabilities, ADHD, autism--we know they're clearly linked to vaccines,"" said Paul Thomas, MD, a board-certified pediatrician.Vaxxed III tries to appeal to both the head and the heart. But will this movie move anyone? People might find it hard to believe that the system is as broke as the movie says it is. Vaccine issues are complex and it's tempting to simply shrug and accept the familiar ""safe and effective"" sound bite. That had been the approach, unfortunately, of many people who ended up giving interviews for this movie.",True

1,9,Masterpiece,Tamasaburo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don´t say this lightly, but I think this movie is a masterpiece. It´s more than the sum of it´s parts and the parts alone would make an astonishing story. But the interaction between Mr Slahi and his former torturers as well as the insights into the lives of those former U. S. Army members, now broken and mentally at the bottom, are the stuff which elevate this film above any other way to tell this story, no other media could transport the wealth of immanence, the quality of insight the viewer gains by watching these people. Credit to Mr Goetz and Mr Hopkins for pulling this off, finding those people, making them expose themselves on camera in the way they do, encouraging them to speak but treating them respectfully all the while is very good film-making. There is no need to give this any kind of spin, because we see, everyone can see for themselves what this strangely intimate relationship between the victim of torture and his wardens looks like. It´s a strong testament for the futility and inhumanity of torture, for both sides of it.This movie should be seen by many more people.",True
2,6,Intersection of Truth and Fantasy: Surprises and Outrage Unveiled in the Film,gxwnxwbjm,n/a,16/08/2025,"If we consider the truth to be based on the outcome of the trial, the members of this special project team completely distrusted the trial results, still holding onto their own fantasies. They portrayed him as a villain, resembling individuals who refused to acknowledge their own mistakes. On the other hand, as he tries to recover from the harrowing experience, he surprised me by expressing forgiveness towards the person who subjected him to such brutal torture, a belief that contrasts with the victim image I hold. The initial motive behind filming this movie was his desire to invite those who tortured him for tea, but in reality, he expected to host them for tea, anticipating words of apology as souvenirs. However, Mr. X responded with violent outbursts once again.",False

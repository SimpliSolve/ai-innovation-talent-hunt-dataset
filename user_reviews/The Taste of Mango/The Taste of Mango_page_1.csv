1,9,"Charming , honest, and loving!",amooredmsound,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary deals with the most difficult subject of sexual abuse. Unlike most, it focuses on the long term affects of the abuse in relationship of the abused woman with her daughter, and with her mother. Her daughter is the filmmaker, and we see her perspective and her love in a very touching and honest film. The film spans several years, and shows their changing relationship as they sometimes uncomfortably deal with the truth. I saw this documentary at True/False Film Fest with a sold out house. The Director was there, and answered many questions afterwards from the audience. If she chooses, she should have a bright future in filmmaking. This is a remarkable accomplishment and well worth viewing.",False

1,10,Impressive documentary,rickybuys1978,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well let me start by just saying it right away.This is one of the best documentary I ve ever seen. The really explain his origins in Hip Hop, his come up, his unique personality . We all knew (as HioHop Heads) he's well loved in the scene.Loved it when I saw some of the footage use...
And seeing in the documentary some of the GOATS in the Game giving the Biz his flowers is great and how they talk about him about how he was and how they met him. That wasn't the usual way you getting to know some others ... loved the way all the great names in HipHop talked about him with a big smile thinking about him.The idea of using a puppet for the hospital sc√®nes about his last battle did feel a bit weird the first few seconds, I thought : Oh no, but have to admit , it really worked unexpectedly good in the film. Big probs to the makers ...and to his wife , for ""playing"" herself in this scenes , that must 've been really hard. Nothing but respect for herIncredible docu , did shed quite a few tears ..
it's giving him the respect and recognition this icon deserves...RIP BIZ MARKIENOBODY BEATS THE BIZ!!",False
2,n/a,Fresh original and brilliant.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"A simply great documentary about Biz Markie. If like me you knew only a little this will fill in everything about the man, who he was, how he worked with so many incredible artists and made an amazing career for himself. With unique graphics, music and animation this isn't your run of the mill cookie cutter documentary, this doc carries Biz's legacy of bringing people joy and will make you smile with his wit and silliness. From back in a Long Island high school cafeteria his family and friends paint some a vivid picture that hand to god the screening broke out in song of Just a Friend.Go see it!",False

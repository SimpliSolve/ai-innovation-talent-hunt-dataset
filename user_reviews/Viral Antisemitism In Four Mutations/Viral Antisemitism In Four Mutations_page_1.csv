1,n/a,Excellent,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Impossible to watch it and not to appreciate - on every level it's a very good documentary, which shows interviews and events that convey a worrying phenomenon. It's a subtle and clever work! Highly recommended !

2,10,"Hungary, George Soros, and the Labour Party",kh-17438,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPoor George Soros. This documentary truly explains how completely and unfairly he has been vilified. And Hungary is a mess because of their anti Jewish practices and hatred.And the Labour Party-I had no clue of their anti Jewish and therefore terrible history.The homey and, at first, likable politician with a viscious message/platform is absolutely chilling.I've highly recommended this to all my friends and family.",True

2,8,Excellent local documentary,wernerpereira,n/a,16/08/2025,"Top notch production, a story told beautifully. This documentary will keep you nailed to the screen for 4 hours, and it's an emotional ride.",False
3,8,The banality of evil,techfilz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This 4 part documentary follows the trail of bodies left behind by a murder cult in a small South African town. Krugersdorp, near Johannesburg, is the eponymous town of the title ""Devilsdorp"" or Devil's town.Witnesses and family members of the victims tell their stories in a narrative which does not get bogged down in the complexity of the case. There are some unanswered questions at the end , but the documentary faithfully represents the community and systems of belief at the heart of this murderous enterprise.",False
4,8,"Horrific, crazy, and just pure madness",bryancurse,n/a,16/08/2025,"This story is the craziest documentary I have seen regarding anything to come from South Africa.Some things are truly unbelievable.Such sadness for those who have lost loved ones.Definitely up for local awards, if not international.",False
5,8,The most unbelievable story...,cvdspuy,n/a,16/08/2025,"The most unbelievable story... if a Hollywood script writer wrote this, it probably wouldn't see.the light of day because it is just so bizarre, so incredible that nobody would produce this movie because it seems not possible and yet, it happened! Well worth watching...",False
6,7,The real problem,willieb-52785,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn general the documentary is well presented but there are some big issues:
The events had nothing to with the occult. Cecelia was never a witch or anything else for that matter. She was expelled from school in grade 9. She used the 'occult ' to worm her way into Ria's gulliable religious group , their finances and their lives.The town of Krugersdorp had very little to do with anything. Cecelia wasn't even born there and they initially all lived in other towns.The 'revenge murders' were committed in other places - not Krugersdorp. The 'financial murders' however were.The real issue is that Cecelia Steyn is a psychopath. Her lies, deceit and fabrications were all part of her game. The real surprise is how she pulled intelligent and educated people into her lunacy and wiped the floor with them. I suspect that drugs and alcohol abuse was a big part of the scene.",True
7,10,Absolutely Brilliant,lofts55,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a great Series. The subject matter was truly horrific and it seems unbelievable that people can get sucked into situations like this which happened but all too often nowadays - plenty of people are involved in hideous atrocities through drugs, money or some other situation in their lives.Most of those people drawn into situations such as this would never normally act in the way they did but having said that, there must be something inanely weird in their life or in their mind, which enables them to be manipulated to commit horrendous acts of brutality. The telling of the Story was brilliantly done and one thing I would like to know which I hope should have been followed up was the story behind the ""high ranking policeman"" who was removed from the Case and not named who was more involved than was known.",False
8,7,Cautionary into fundamental beliefs,vulture64,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent true crime doco, covering South African religious serial killings 2012-2016.Cautionary tale into the dangers of insulated and extreme religious belief system (in this case Christian), and the dark path it can lead down.",False
9,9,how in the d...ls name could this all happen...?...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a civilized country where the majority of the population is god believers, and where these are completely blinded by the light harbouring and supporting a indespicable criminal like this...?Im shocked and awed how religion and the opposite can fluxify the mind of healthy and sound people to become knights of the good or the bad, and let them rat for all eternity where they are now.This documentary tells me that a judicial system without juries works better in such cases like this, where the all accused except the master have confessed their deeds and gets multipel life sentences for it, maybe should have been introduced in other socalled civilized democracies, such as usa GB and even norway where im seated.The quality of the product is bland, there are many deepdives that are left and pulled up in another episode, people tend to forget what happened last week so this is for the true crime binger. The timeline though are good, and the contents of real photo and film documentation are overwhelming.So if you can deal with the drawbacks of fundamentalists beliefs and satanism, then have a look.",False
10,9,Gripping,barn_se,n/a,16/08/2025,"A brutal, shocking story unfolds in this well made documentary.",False
11,9,Fact is stranger than fiction,paulfalconerkhan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDevilsdorp is a tour de force. An extraordinary study in cult behaviour and psychopathy. So spellbinding, I binge watched it start to finish. There are many unanswered questions regarding the police investigation into the first batch of murders but ultimately the dedication and professionalism of the police and prosecuting authorities shone thru. Could lives have been saved along the way is something we'll never know. Heartbreaking documentary in the extreme for the families of victims. Overall a huge thumbs up for the producers of the excellent show. Hope it garners a clutch of awards internationally.",True

1,3,Tragic,Barry0169,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm not sure what is more tragic -- what happened to Whitney or this pathetic attempt at a documentary. It was completely disorganized and they did a horrible job of trying to tell a story. This was more about Whitney's do-called friends capitalizing off of her name than an actual dcoumentary. The worst part is the friends continuing to make excuses for Whitney's drug use because they refuse to accept responsibility for their part in this tragedy. Everyone involved in this should be ashamed for continuing to ride on Whitney's coattails.,False

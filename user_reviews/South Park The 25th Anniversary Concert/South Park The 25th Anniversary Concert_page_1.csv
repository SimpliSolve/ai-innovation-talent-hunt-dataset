1,8,"F^*k Yeah, Colorado!",wasabiteabag,n/a,15/08/2025,"From Rancid to Rush, the boys have come a long way since Chef Aid: The South Park Album that was released during the show's second season. Loved that CD as a horny 12yr old that had to skip the 'Mousse T. Vs. Hot 'n' Juicy' track when my mum came into my room.24yrs later, I'm 36 and have been involved with the content distribution side of South Park in my region for the past 9yrs. Legends of comedy, this concert is not only a tribute to the masterminds that created it, but a thank you to the fans that stuck with them.Also, F^*k Yeah slurpees!",False
2,10,Well Done!!!,iggles36,n/a,15/08/2025,"A lot of fun for any South Park fan. It really shows how much goes into the show to make a 'silly cartoon'. Every detail was well done. The only wish I had would have been a tribute to Chef. No matter how or why they parted ways, Chef is a huge part of the show.Otherwise, I say Bravo!!!",False
3,10,That's called a Montage!,kchiasson-77464,n/a,15/08/2025,"Awesome performances. üëåI've been a fan of South Park since watching the first episode on Global TV (Canada) back in '97.I love Matt & Trey for their talents, balls, and extremely clever 'smut magazine' sense of humour.This concert truly was something special and would have loved to be a part of it live, with all of the other fans.Check it out!üëç üëç",False
4,10,Absolutely Awesome,whatwhatwhowherewhy,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI did not go to the concert, but even as a viewer watching on my laptop this was very fun. I've watched the show for all my life, and getting to listen and watch all the songs be played live was very fun. The songs are good and are still good to this day, still being catchy and still cracking me up, along with the mix of songs from Primus and Ween. I loved that they also sang the songs in the original key as well, don't see that a lot with older performers. I also loved how cool it was to see Matt & Trey enjoy themselves, treating it as a celebration for themselves and for the fans. I also loved how heartwarming it was seeing Trey getting a little choked up at the beginning, and during ""It's Easy Mkay"", it was very sweet to see an emotional side to it. And the surprise appearance with Rush was awesome as well. The only thing I wish about this concert was that Comedy Central and Viacom didn't cut ""Merry F*ckin Christmas"" from the broadcast version. If you got time to kill, love South Park and want to see good performances from everyone including Matt & Trey, watch this.",True
5,10,Gave me goosebumps,fallenwthyou217,n/a,15/08/2025,This was honestly amazing. If you're a true south park fan you'll love this. I didn't want it to stop. I was singing along in my cubicle at work. Just seeing them have fun was awesome.,False

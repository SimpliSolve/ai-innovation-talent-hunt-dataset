1,6,The hunger for money,Leofwine_draca,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerRival bounty hunters hunt for a missing stash of cash that Colonel Gaddafi exported to South Africa before his gruesome death almost a decade ago. This wide-reaching international documentary shines a revealing light into the dark and murky world of African politics, exploring the corruption it finds there. It's a murky and complex beast, based around insightful interviews with some larger-than-life and some rather sinister characters, and it reveals plenty during the course of its running time. Mostly about the greed ever-present in human nature.",True
2,6,What a mess,OJT,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe film is not as good and exciting as i hoped. There's done a good job in revealing the stolen billions from good sources, still I was sitting back with a falt feeling from what could be a thriller ride in telling.I know this is a complex dealing, and so many who wanna hide and try to det hold of some of it, and maybe we can't expect more than being left confused.But for a 100 minute film, I had expected more excitement, or call it a etter dramatic telling. After all this is both criminal and exciting.",True

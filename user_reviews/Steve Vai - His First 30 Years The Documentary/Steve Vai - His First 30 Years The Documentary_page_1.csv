1,9,When You'd Thought You Knew It All....,bigtmor,n/a,16/08/2025,"A doc like this comes along and fills in blanks that you didn't know existed. Especially cool was all the info on Vai's childhood, and high school years. Of course, as a MAMMOTH Zappa fan, I already knew of his pedigree with Frank, how he hooked up with him , and how Steve considers him 1 of the 3 most influential mentors ever, in his life. Very well researched, presented and paced documentary. Humorous at times as well. Lots of quotes from Vai that I'd never heard him discuss before. A must for Vai freaks. A must for any musician, I'd even say. I'm a drummer, but I bought ""Flex-able"" because I knew Steve from Zappa. Mr. Vai is also seemingly just a genuinely good human being that has done a lot of self-analysis to become comfortable in his own skin and to achieve the goals he sets for himself. A very well-made piece of work here. Highly recommended.",False
2,9,A TRUE Jem üòâ,The_Dunadan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great insight on one of the greatest musicians to ever walk our beautiful blue earth.This documentary truly dives into Steve's story, his motivations and the circumstances that led him to become who he is now as a whole.It's full of really great anecdotes and a really detailed reconstruction from his early childhood.This material really shows how Steve kept being consistent about the path he wanted to walk as a man and the kind of musician he always wanted to be. It's been truly inspiring.If you love Steve, this is a true gem you MUST see hands down. This man has been one of my lifetime heroes, and it's a true privilege knowing this much more about him.Already looking forward for part 2! üëèüëèüëè",False
3,9,Time flew by,fdoorhof,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not really someone that can easily sit through something that runs longer than 30 minutes unless it's super interesting.Well this hit the nail on the head
Awesome stories and loads of humor
Would have loved to see more from Steve himself or his music but as it is it's well worth a big fat 9 and a must see. Can't recommend this enoughEven if you're not a Steve Vai fan.The documentairy has a great flow and offers nice animations, unique photos and awesome stories.At first my thoughts was that they really did their research and I wondered where they got all these really in depth information, i actually did stop the documentary to find out more information and even had the question ""man I hope he at least checked everything very carefully"". But my answer came very quickly...... Steve did assist with making this documentary and that immediately made it for me one of the best I even saw about him.Getting literally everywhere by the age of 30 is impressive but having met Steve in the past and seeing his social media streams and how he interacts with his fans it just goes without saying this is a document of not just a musical genius but also a great human being.(He's one of the people i would travel for to photograph ;))In short.Even if you are not into guitar players this is still highly recommended. If you love guitars..... Why are you still reading. Press play man.",False
4,10,Must-see!,luizfelipelimaoliveira,n/a,16/08/2025,"Outstanding. If you love guitar, the 80's and great stories, you can't miss this doc. It shows how amazing and full of creativity Steve Vai has ever been, and how his experience in life shaped him and his music. I feel like I have a much better understanding about him and his life work after watching it, and thankfully I had a glimpse on how he grew up as a kid and how it helped him becoming who he is now. I'd love if it had more interviews and maybe showed some other people speaking (as it is mostly voice over) but the content is so great that I don't feel like it's a problem at all. You definitely should watch it!",False
5,10,FAN-TASTIC,mitchswatson,n/a,16/08/2025,"If one of your more musical friends showing you Steve Vai in your friend's bedroom when you were 14 wasn't enough to make you a fan of Steve Vai - sit down, toss this documentary on.I rate this piece of film a 9.5/10 and IMDB stipulates the rating must be an even number, 10 it is.Steve is a funny dude. Filmmaker is a funny dude. Always a plus when those characteristics harmonise.I expected to enjoy this, I expected to learn a thing or two. I am now convinced I must rewatch it to soak up any and all precious moments and teachings.Edit: Just did, glad I did it. I have planned to rewatch it again and again again. Shout-out cooking oil.",False

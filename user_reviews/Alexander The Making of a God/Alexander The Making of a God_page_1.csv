1,5,Is it intentional?,True_Detective,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am starting to notice a pattern.You watch a Netflix series about some true historical figures, and you are shown some admirable things about them. The aesthetics are beautiful. You finish watching it, and you feel satisfied, and are glad to have been told an interesting chapter of history that you now feel you ""know from beginning to end"".Then you later find out, through reading either the primary sources (or reading other people's reviews, as in the case of this series) that the series was actually wildly inaccurate, and in a suspicious way. A ton of really epic stuff was just LEFT OUT. They also added a lot of inaccurate stuff that makes the characters look bad.The end result is that the story, and the characters portrayed, were watered down and made mediocre in the series, contrasted to the actual real story.I've seen this with the abominable series ""The Last Czars"", and now also with this Alexander series. I also Notice that there is some overlap between these 2 series, regarding the writers behind them!I can't help but wonder if this is done intentionally, to wipe away our history? As an analogy, it's like people going to see a huge epic temple that they've heard about, but someone has set up a cheap mediocre replica on the way, so that the people will stop there instead, and not see the real one.",False
2,6,"Decent, but...",ValR1821,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt should be no surprise that our Slavic friends to the north are coming out of the woodwork to spread their propaganda and claim Alexander as their own, but it does rankle. There are historical inaccuracies in this docu-drama series, but the assertion that Alexander is Greek is not one of them. After all, the Macedonians spoke Greek, worshipped the Greek gods, and spread Greek culture throughout the known world. Alexander's dynasty also claimed descent on his father's side to Hercules and the royal family of Argos (hence Philip and Alexander's royal house was referred to as the Argeads). On his mother's side, Alexander claimed to be descended from Achilles. So, definitely Greek.As to the production itself, the acting was actually quite well done and the dialogue not bad either (usually both are mediocre at best in these types of productions), although it glosses over Alexander's life, leaving out a lot of important information and life events. It also feels a bit disjointed when the series cuts away to the historians, and although they are certainly knowledgeable, I would have preferred to stick with the drama. As to the historical inaccuracies, I would say that the worst of it involves the costuming - in particular, the Macedonians' battle armor. I did, however, appreciate that the producers attempted to shed some light on Darius and the Persians, and would have appreciated even more of that, given what a rich and advanced culture the Persians had.In a nutshell, once again I feel as though Alexander's story would be much better served by a multi-season drama series. A two or three hour movie is not sufficient to tell such a grand tale, and the docudrama format is also not the best way to do justice to it either. Give us a great HBO-style three or four-season, 10 episode per season drama series. I guarantee it would be a blockbuster.",True
3,7,Enjoyable despite its flaws,natearutkus-13590,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off most of these reviews clearly did not make it past the first episode for various reasons.The gay angle being put forth in the first 15 min or so seems to have upset people. This has been a debate for a long time with Alexander. Did you really expect it to not be included, especially coming from Netflix? I'm on episode 6 now and it is barely mentioned again. So if they needed to put that forth in the first few moments and get it out of the way to hit the Netflix absurd quota, fine. It is not a big deal.The accuracy. Again it is Netflix. I am shocked it actually was entertaining and covered SOME aspects correctly. It is still a drama and meant for entertainment. There is no way to cover all Alexander accomplished in this type of show. This focused on Darius and the battle with each other. Simplistic, absolutely. Missing a lot, definitely. Still worth watching, I think so.The casting. Again with Netflix the fact they did not cast Alexander as black is surprising in and of itself. I had no issue with the casting at all. In fact the guy that plays Alexander I think fit perfectly and if they ever do a proper Alexander story, I would like to see him play the role again.Heavily flawed no doubt. Maybe I have been starved for something about Alexander for a while and was just happy with getting something.",False
4,n/a,Was this made by a child?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Alexander: The Making of A God"" arrived on Netflix, and as someone perpetually on the lookout for hidden gems in historical dramas, I stumbled upon this series with a mix of curiosity and hopeful anticipation. The prospect of uncovering a captivating portrayal of Alexander the Great, one of my top historical figures, was a promising prospect. However, what I discovered within the first few minutes of the series left me with a sense of disillusionment, prompting an abrupt halt to my viewing experience.Unlike the eager anticipation often associated with highly anticipated releases, my eagerness was more akin to a quest for a hidden treasure. Unfortunately, the treasure proved elusive, as the series failed to meet even the modest expectations I had set for an engaging historical drama.The initial disappointment stemmed from the lackluster acting that permeated the series. The characters, including the pivotal role of Alexander himself, felt like mere shadows of their historical counterparts. The performances lacked the depth and authenticity required to bring these historical figures to life, leaving the audience with a detached and unengaging experience. In contrast to my initial hope for a diamond in the rough, the cast's inability to convey the complexities of their characters left me feeling as though I had stumbled upon fool's gold.Compounding the issue was the uninspired direction that failed to salvage the lackluster performances. The series stumbled through crucial events in Alexander's life without allowing the narrative to breathe or the characters to evolve. The pacing felt disjointed, resulting in a narrative that lacked cohesion and emotional resonance. It was a missed opportunity to explore the intricate relationships and political intrigue surrounding Alexander, turning what could have been an exciting historical drama into a forgettable and uninspiring series.My decision to pause the first episode and navigate away from Netflix was not driven by a sense of betrayal or dashed expectations but rather by the realization that my quest for a hidden gem had led me astray. The show, rather than being an unpolished masterpiece waiting to be discovered, turned out to be a lackluster addition to the historical drama genre.It's worth noting that this unexpected disappointment came as a surprise, especially considering Netflix's track record of delivering quality original content. While every streaming platform has its hits and misses, ""Alexander: The Making of A God"" stands out as an unfortunate misstep in a sea of otherwise commendable productions. It raises questions about the curation process and quality control mechanisms in place for Netflix originals, leaving viewers like myself wondering how such a lackluster series made its way onto the platform.In conclusion, my eagerness to uncover a hidden gem in historical drama led me to ""Alexander: The Making of A God,"" only to be met with a series that failed to deliver on its potential. The combination of subpar acting and uninspired direction diminished the allure of exploring Alexander the Great's story, leaving me with a sense of missed opportunity rather than the triumphant discovery I had hoped for. For those seeking engaging historical dramas, this series may not be the treasure trove they are looking for.It was so bad, so fast, that I put it down instantly.",False
5,7,Not as bad as other reviews say !,AishwarySinha27,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just like the Mehmed series, its another piece form the history.. about Alexander and him being called and praised as 'Son of Zeus' ..
Overall the series is 60% Entertaining and 40% based on history..
So dont expect the accurate history lessons from the series. The show is rather to be watched as an entertainment.The actors are fine and some of the war scenes are shot well but they are quite short.. .The show has narations running behind the scenes which can be irritating sometimes.. but overall I enjoyed the show and its not as bas as the other reviews are saying...Its definetly entertainig and one time watch..",False
6,2,Netflix needs to stop calling this kind of work as documentaries.,averagedeveloper,n/a,16/08/2025,"Historical parody in documentary format. Actually, I give 6 points to content that I finish without being bored in the least, but this work misleads people historically. What the historians in this series do is not in line with the ethics of their profession. A historian and archaeologist has an obligation to try presenting history in its most accurate form. As a branch of science, of course, within the most current findings. Professional ethics requires this. I am in a country where we live to see how serious the consequences of distortion of historical facts can be. You may say that it is obvious that the things shown here are not very accurate historically, then what is the point of making a documentary. Also there will always be an audience that will believe and accept what they see.",False
7,7,Don't read the bad reviews,robertasmith,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a well made documentary and, as is common with the modern trend, it relies heavily on actors playing out the story. Mostly such filmed sequences but linked by academic experts explaining the history. It works extremely well and all of the academics are mainstream and very able. Professor Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones Is particularly good and it must be a joy to study under him. Some minor irritations include some over emphasis on historically unproven incidents and not enough from Professor Ali Ansari, who, like Lllewellyn-Jones, really knows his stuff. A good series that is good on history and makes it clear where mythology is involved.",False
8,8,Don't listen to the armchair historians this was a great series,simonnicholls-05914,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really enjoyed this series, I really liked the historians they picked, no idea why they got so much hatred, all from respected universities all were quite passionate about the story, especially enjoyed the welsh guy (forgotten his name!) all seemed to be knowledgeable about the subject.Sure they took some artistic license with certain elements but the tales are always subjective to some extent.I really liked the layout of the series flicking between the talking heads and the dramatised series. Acting was decent, series was great fun, I binged watched it and it definitely got me more interested in this period of history.If you're not Dave from Swansea who's already read two books on Alexander and thus is the golden source of truth now from his armchair and you go into it with an open mind (it's not trying to be a Hollywood film like Troy), you'll enjoy it.",False
9,7,It's entertainment,nicolefogolin,n/a,16/08/2025,So many damning reviews. It's is entertainment woven around a great historical figure for whom there are many myths and legends. The show introduces Alexander to a broader audience. It also gives a bit of screen time to Alexander's 2nd wife which is nice as women in history are a bit overlooked in the shadows the men cast. This is entertainment and to be honest not a lot less factual than a lot of stuff you see on the history channel. Enjoy it for what it is and marvel at the genius of a great mind and restless action. The landscapes are beautiful and his achievements in the ancient world truly astounding.,False
10,9,Excellent docudrama,terrylarosa,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well made docudrama about Alexander. Is it entirely accurate? No it's not but then what ever is. If however there are several professors talking about it I'd tend to believe them more than these hateful internet cellar dwellers who nowadays, literally rip just about everything apart for their endless whining. I really don't care if the Persian's armor was accurate ( as long they're not wearing ripped jeans I'm good). Superb acting from most of the cast ( especially Alexander and Darius ). There are some small, interesting scenes about the digging being done in Alexandria and the search for his tomb. The battle scenes are limited but this understandably is not a huge budget show or movie. Still it has good production values and some really great drama. Be warned: like the story of Mehmet this is left open for a part 2. Can't wait.",False
11,7,Enjoy as drama...,andrewspg152,n/a,16/08/2025,"Alexander the Great is a legend. A wonderful legend. But only a legend. And this series is just entertainment.I'm a m/t Greek speaker, so I'm watching it mute with Greek subtitles... Works quite well, as entertainment.I'm a fan of Valerio Massimo Manfredi, the Italian archeologist/ancient historian and novelist, whose Alexander Trilogy is a masterpiece of storytelling.I'm not interested in Alexander's 'historicity' because for me, he is a legend and that's how I know and love him.So, this series relates that legend in a certain way that I find quite enjoyable, in Greek!If I want 'accuracy' I'll go to a book. For me this is simply pure ancient escapism! Wonderful!",False
12,1,The worst Alexander depiction of all time,aditot,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAre you guys hoping to see Alexander studying with Aristotle? Or maybe how he tamed his famous horse? Or the epic campains in which he, together with his father, subdued the great Greek cities? How they annihilated the Sacred Band of Thebes? Tough luck. But in exchange, you will see him licking and kissing Hephaestion. Whom in turn is calling him Alex, like they are in third grade in the school yard.They didn't even bother to make-up Fillip's eye even though any school boy knows that he lost his right eye in battle. Whoever produced this abomination should really consider another career, movie making is not for him.",True
13,n/a,Horrible.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was excited to watch this and learn more about Alexander. I'm fascinated by that time frame but it's just episode after episode of boring battle scenes with no real story line. It's all over the place. Huge let down. Another Netflix bomb, I should have known since Netflix doesn't seem interested in producing quality anymore. I'm not sure why they keep putting projects like this out? It's not enjoyable to watch and they also don't seem to respect the truth in their story lines. Another Netflix complete disappointment. It could have been good but it absolutely and completely missed the mark!!!",False
14,6,Some reality about Alexander,Valinasab,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although these days kids don't read history as much, it's still good to know our world has been formed. After the silly 300, this series has some historical basis. Even if not 100% accurate, but million times better than stupid 300. On the down side, everything is a close up. The producers could have used some computer simulations to show the sizes of the armies. There is no way of knowing the sizes of the armies and cities.Again, at lease some history supporting this show. The researcher comments were useful too. Lastly, in the maps, they used cities old names, it would have been useful to include the current names in the brackets).",False
15,1,Unbelievably stupid,jfwaalbers,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBased on two episodes:Juist like in some of the earlier Netflix 'documentaries', the amount of historical inaccuracies, important developments neglected and abuse of (proably previously recorded) expert contributions are astounding. Just three to start with:""1) No attention to why Macedon became dominant in Greece and was able to attack the Achaemenid Persion empire.2) No mention of military tactics, the innovations of the phalanx etc.3) No discussion of alternative sources or different interpretations of historical sources.Add to that: ridiculous acting in and scripting of 're-enactments' and an insane narration by somone pretending to be an Egyptian priestess.Nonsense. -1 star.",True
16,10,Really Good !,MarcusConely,n/a,16/08/2025,"How many specious comments, full of notions but totally ignorant of understanding what they are looking at! These ones from Netflix are hybrid docu-fictions: hybrids! Therefore the historical reconstruction that is present is accompanied by a filmic vision that is not intended to be simply documentary but imaginative!Despite the obvious differences in means (budget, cast, etc.) I appreciated this ""Alexander the Making of God"" much more than Oliver Stone's film!I found much more strength and credibility in this very virile Alexander, with his wonderful dirty and dark armor than in that parody starring Colin Farrell from which the actor himself distanced himself, it was so grotesque!Truthfulness is something other than truth... and that's why it's called fiction.The costumes are perfect: they describe the character splendidly and help to immediately understand the differences in the worlds in which the protagonists move. So much criticism of the actors is absolutely senseless considering that they are all really convincing in their roles. (Mido Hamada's Darius is wonderful).The language is simple and direct to reach a wide audience!The cinematography is good too!This docu-series is really well made and certainly pays homage to an immense character like Alexander, inviting many people to delve deeper into it.",False
17,6,"Interesting history, bad actors",c_obertop,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interesting to learn more about Alexander and how he conquered Persia. I like these documentaries with a mix of historians telling their facts, and some dramatic scenes played out. But they could not have picked a LESS charismatic and less believable actor to play the role of Alexander who must have exuded and unbelievable power and charisma in real life. The other actors are not very convincing either and I wonder if the whole thing is not an American, paternalistic interpretation of how Greeks and Persians and Egyptians were and how they interacted with each other. For example the bringers of bad news staring straight into the eyes of king Darius, and continuing to stare while he weeps.... I doubt that things went like that! And it is also quite shallow in celebrating violence and war, without any nuance.",False
18,1,Sick of this,kejbi-39792,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yet again, Netflix makes the same mistakes, making everything feel like a joke.This feels like a cheap soap opera instead of a documentary. The inaccuracy of the historical events are insane, the acting is very sad and forced. Nothing is explained about Alexander's life, they only induced fake drama which makes no sense at all.This is a shame, Alexander has always been one of my favourite rulers from the past and I was hoping for some new information or at least a good interpretation of the ones all of us know.This is another Netflix fail, do not waste your time if you are a history nerd, all you will end up on with is being sad and frustrated.",False
19,8,Quite good,fiona_rp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why so many negative reviews?? It seems well researched to me and I am an educator. I can only assume people have nothing better to do than diss a perfectly good program.Firstly there are frequent interviews with both American and British professors who provide an interesting and truthful commentary.Secondly as it was so long ago in history the series relies heavily on research and documentation. As none of us lived in this era we can not agree or disagree as to exact events.So relax, enjoy the action and a good blend of both acting and interviews because for me it brings it to life.....",False
20,6,Making History,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Could have gone His-tory - I think I did something similar with the Cleopatra ""documentary"" ... now why do I write it like that? And I do not mean the headline (no pun intended there), but the fact that for this is not what I personally would call a documentary. It is a bit fiction, it is a bit people talking (or talking heads) ... with the reenactment part being quite big here.Oliver Stones Alexander had its issues - and I get it that some may have had issues with the movie tackling his sexuality. The thing is no one knows for sure - but is it or rather could it be likely he liked both men and women? I think that is a possibility. Overall that should not matter - it does not take anything away from his achievements ... and there were quite a few of them.This right here lists many of them. It also gives a face to the Persians ... something I was not really privy to when we learned about history in (Greek) class. So in a sense it is quite interesting and nice to see a bit of different sides to this. Overall Alexander is really getting a good treatment here - I don't think any ""fan"" of his should have issues with that.Even though this is quite long and has quite a few episodes it still can not cover all his life - or legacy for that matter. Which seems to be something a second season may be tackling .. I do not think I will watch that. The format itself is not really something that entices me to put it mildly ... for what it's worth it was interesting and way less ""painful"" than Cleopatra ... but you may feel differently of course ...",False
21,1,Very inaccurate,lalasour,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found the documentary disappointing due to its inaccurate portrayal of historical figures, particularly Darius. The depiction of Darius with a turban and eyeliner seemed more akin to a caricature than a respectful representation of the Persian Emperor, who was a significant figure in establishing human rights. Persia was the cradle of art and architecture at the time and at its highest. This portrayal of Darius felt more like a misrepresentation, leaning towards an 'Arabic snake dancer' stereotype rather than a dignified leader of the largest empire of the time. It seemed as though the documentary was more a tribute to Alexander rather than an objective historical account, failing to accurately represent the facts and events of that era. This was a letdown, as I expected a documentary to offer a factual and unbiased view.",False
22,n/a,Good videography but disappointing screenwriting.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The scenes play like something you would find in a serialised graphic novel, some frames are overly drawn (with dramatic music). The way the script constantly switches between dialogue and the historians is unappreciated, because is the way it paces past dramatic bits just leaves big blanks. Several historical inaccuracies are present in the script. The historians also never mention any names of any primary authors or sources, historical contentions are just that. The script also favours showing a scene with Alexander kissing Hephaestion rather than being mentored by Plato. I doubt the former is what led to Alexander continuing to be revered today. You won't appreciate this as a fan of the Classics unless its props or eye-candy you're after. I wouldn't be surprised to see the prop-maker win more awards than the rest of the crew.The videography however, props and lighting are phenomenal though.",False
23,6,"Nice as a drama, terrible as a documentary",koen-18956,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerTerrible narating style. Very over the top historians and a lot of inaccuracies. Overal nice visuals and okay acting. Great costumes and decent cinematography. But seems very incomplete. It looks like there are mayor gaps in the story and for a documentary way too much dialogue that all is just made up nonsense.A docuseries with actors is a great concept to bring historie to a bigger audience. But there should be more facttelling and more historians rather than the useless and weird dialogue.Show more items from musea and less footage of crazy historians. Narrating is enough. Show us more of the written and drawn history.,True
24,9,Sparks Interest in History,EngSetterLvr,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary series sparked my interest in Alexander the Great who I admittedly knew very little about prior to watching it. The style is creative, combining dramatic acting with embedded interviews from historical experts-archaeologists who have devoted their lives to unearthing artifacts connected to Alexander as well as professors who have devoted their lives to historical research. I found myself researching facts about Alexander and the various individuals mentioned in the series. It was both entertaining and informative. I need 64 more characters to submit this, so I'll add this quote from the series-""The journey is the thing"" - attributed to Homer.",False
25,4,"Watch it as a drama, NOT a documentary",elmoutesidi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not a spoiler, highly inaccurate series. I agree with anither review saying that the 300 movie was more accurate than this 😂. So many missed moments, missed battles, inaccurate events oh so many. It felt like watching something like ""ancient aliens"", like this is a hypothesis of a couple of PhDs. The disappointing part also is that one of the historians is from St Andrews University. It had such high standards.. Clearly not anymore. Although, that historian was the most serious and studious than the rest of them! One is in love with Alexander and is telling a story that he has in his mind and the other is almost like making fun of him. What an odd series. Only reason I put 4 stars, is for the drama series, not the historians nor the highly inaccurate story.",False

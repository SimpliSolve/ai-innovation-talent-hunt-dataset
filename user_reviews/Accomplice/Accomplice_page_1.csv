1,7,also fun for non-freak cyclists,jan-07680,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed watching is documentary. I watched it yesterday and vividly remember several of the mountainbikers and the atmosphere surrounding them: 2 brothers, 2 friends, a guy and his dog, a group of friends. All of the parts of this documentary have the following in common: mountainbiking, nature and friendship.",False
2,9,Feel-good shreddage!,jstring017,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm no mountain biker and I hella enjoyed this film. Totally took me back to when I got my first BMX and all I wanted to do was go for mondo air! The Graham Aggaiz segment is one of the dopest pieces of cinematography I've ever seen in extreme sports. I said I'm not mountain biker at the start of this, but I just might be soon. One last big ups to Paul Basagoitia! Pure inspiration.",False

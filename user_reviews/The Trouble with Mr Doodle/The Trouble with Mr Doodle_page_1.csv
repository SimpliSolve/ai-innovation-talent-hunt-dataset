1,10,A remarkable and inspired docu-movie of artist Mr Doodle!,chrisdixon-64305,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an absolute GEM of a docu-movie that puts you right at the heart of the Mr Doodle story. This film deserves to be a ""trending"" tile on Netflix or Prime. Beautifully shot, blending old family footage with early archive work and modern day stop motion animation - the audience is left wondering two key things: 1. How does Mr Doodle do what he does?; and 2. How did they make and edit this film so well to pull together his full story? It is an emotional rollercoaster taking the audience on a complex journey through the challenges of the person (Sam) and the character (Mr Doodle). It left me with the overwhelming sense that everyone needs to get to know the work and life of Mr Doodle.",False
2,6,"Part raw and sympathetic, part promo.",jobevans,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really did feel for Sam and his family and right the way through was fully invested ... I shed a tear or two... until it became clear that they weren't going to talk at all about what psychosis actually is, what caused it and how it was treated. For a time it looked like he may be schizophrenic and we can only assume that that was explored and found not to be the case but we are not informed really of any of the facts or clinical exploration that must have happened around the time he was deeply unwell. The problem is that ""The Trouble..."" is the whole premise of the film, so without it being fully explored, I'm sad to say that it feels like a promotional opportunity.In a time where too many ""content creators"" have broken down, I really feel that the science, the causes and the risks should have been explored.",False
3,10,MUST WATCH!,charlottedunk,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Trouble with Mr Doodle really gave us such an insight into the extremely talented artist Sam Cox ( Mr Doodles ) brain/ life this film will inspire & help a lot of people myself included. Sam & his family really should feel proud to be sharing such a heartfelt & brave part of their life, hearing from his family's & wife's even Sam's school Art teachers perspective of what took place really was so touching.Watching Mr Doodle & Mrs Doodles amazing Doodle mansion be created from start to end is absolutely breathtaking & this film will show you that your dreams truly can become reality! I couldn't recommend watching this more you'll be hooked the whole way through,",False
4,10,"Powerful and inspirational documentary, a must see!",tnjtfkpj,n/a,16/08/2025,"This beautifully composed documentary film takes you on the rollercoaster which is Sam's life. It perfectly enables you to glimpse at the creative genius, from humble beginnings to extraordinary heights and everything in between. The raw emotion from Sam and his family, makes this one of the most powerful films ever made documenting the instability of the mind and how to balance creativity. It's honesty throughout I know will help provoke conversations around mental health, as we positively celebrate Sam for his strength to overcome the challenges and courage to share his toughest moments. Thank you for making this, thank you for sharing it with us.",False
5,1,More film makers cashing in on mental health.,chris_rowe-881-168820,n/a,16/08/2025,"Firstly no reflection of Sam, his partner or family, conditions are real and awful and I'm not going to cast shade on his journey or story however this making content for awareness is so tedious at this point.As someone deep into the mental health system what has all this awareness done? Has it created more jobs, more people get exactly what they need, appointments are regular and personalised? They can tackle multiple issues, well no, quite the opposite, it's lead to the highest number of people clogging up the system and an alarming amount of professionals having to be spread thin for a growing number of people exploiting and abusing the service who use mental health to excuse their personality. The good ira done is heavily outweighed because no one fought for action, just attention, don't believe social media all the time. It's worse than it's ever been as like many things, more aware you make people, the more that'll abuse it for personal gain.So why did I hate this? Well quite easy, there was provably 15 minutes of silly silly including him doing ""crazy eyes"" at the camera in a situation where he was told to do it rather than a bad time, the filming of it spiralling and all the effects made it just another cheap cash in, making an entertainment show out of something important, the end scene with the baby was just awful. How that poor girl stayed is beyond me.There's no detail in the stories, no specifics, no medical experts explaining issues, no talk of and of the ramifications, no talk of really how family felt, how the gf felt or any of that. No real examples of exactly what happened when bad, even though anyone with a brain could see he had issues early on in their filming. It was just a shallow entertainment piece, there was nothing about psychosis, a condition I have. It was just a word in a senate. There was just no detail, no meat to the story and a clear lack of interest in going even remotely deeply. It was lazy, too focused on silly camera effects and him needless trying to look crazy.It'll get praise because people are too scared to actually fight for real mental health change.",False
6,10,Not Just for Mr Doodle fans,steve_crawley,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a touching story concerning the fragility of the human mind and the strength of a mother's love, of an unconventional boy and the troubled genius he became, and of the resilience of a family when circumstances begin to spiral out of control.Fans of Mr Doodle will certainly enjoy the biographical elements of this film and the retrospective look at aspects of his work is interspersed with new sequences of cut-out animation and early footage of his attempts to commercialise his work. But this is more than just a bittersweet biographical film.Poignantly told by his wife, family, and friends, this story touches on the world of art, commercial art, doodles, celebrity and the zeitgeist of the 2020's. But it is not necessary to care about those things, to be moved by this film. It is sufficient simply to be curious about the human condition, and what can happen when creativity turns to obsession.",False
7,10,Must see film,tdzttfyj,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the privilege of watching The Trouble With Mr Doodle today, and it was an insightful, captivating look into the life of an incredibly talented artist. The film dives deep into his creative process and explores his incredible house, which he has completely covered in doodles-an amazing extension of his unique artistic vision. It also highlights important topics like mental health and creativity, shedding light on issues that deserve more attention. The only opportunity for improvement would be that if the film were available on major streaming platforms, it could reach a wider audience and inspire even more important conversations.",False
8,10,A captivating film,kezzy-31831,n/a,16/08/2025,We were lucky enough to see the film recently. Sam's story was beautifully told. Whilst it was so sad to see what he went through it was ultimately so wonderful to see the power of love and how the people around him carried him through to where he is now. We can see from the film that Sam is such a wonderfully talented artist but also a genuinely lovely and humble person. The film explores Sam and his character beautfully and the viewer gets an intimate insight to his life before and after his hospital stay. The film was beautifully shot and put together. Well done to the film makers. We found it captivating.,False
9,10,"Fascinating, well made and not what I was expecting...",garyputtock-08809,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary covers the rise to fame of Sam Cox aka Mr Doodle, who is best known for his exploits in Doodling a Kent mansion inside and out which was internationally televised a few years ago.The film takes you into the mind of Mr Doodle, how the character and his art evolved, his rise to fame in the art industry and making Sam one of the most successful young artists in the world.The story takes a rather dark turn where being Mr Doodle completely consumes Sam, in a way that I can only compare to a supervillain from a Marvel movie, the sometimes haunting and tearful path even has a few funny moments, it's not a light watch and is as much about the psychology of Mr Doodle as it is the art. I'm not a regular documentary viewer but this one had me hooked.",False

Title: Trouble with Mr. Doodle
Director(s): Jaimie D'Cruz, Ed Perkins
Cast: Sam Cox
Length: 90 min
Format: Documentary
Cinematography: Simon Pinfield
Tags: art, creativity, familyThe main idea of Mr. Doodle films is all about people advancing awareness in boundaries and integrity of disabled people's lives and adding hints of creativity and art persuasions for us to break down limitations of stereotypes/barriers of society in order to fulfill our community engagement with one another's experiences and our own. These documentary films also evoke the feelings of using communication via body languages, hand gestures and emotion expressions to the audience, too.2. I watched Trouble with Mr. Doodle film at home and yet I didn't watch the film with anyone else. I mostly watched it all by myself, because I mostly know most ideas of what life is of being a disabled autistic person with creative abilities/craftsmanship like me. The environment/experience was also like a bedroom of space/theater where I'm actually watching a marathon of Smithsonian documentaries based on their true stories, or even painting on canvases.3. As I was watching all ReelAbilities films from 3-9, the ""Trouble with Mr. Doodle"" vid really appeals to me. This is because I loved sketching and drawing with pens too and he always uses doodles with figments of his own imagination, like I do. But, it's also because his compulsions of doodling with pens that makes me think of uncontrollably fidgeting with writing pencils and pens when I was a little child, even as a painting artist. I also took note that, even if geniuses can sometimes go crazy upon themselves, they can still establish their creativities for the most of the societal circumstances. This carries out some powers to articulate my belief/personality of being an artist as well as the others for the better.4. The film really fits into the tropes of Code of the Freaks by Chasnoff and Screening Stereotypes by Longmore because, when we screen stereotypes, we are identifying and resolving some problems of stereotypical behaviors based on their oversimplified imageries/beliefs/race of that person/group. As Paul Longmore puts it, the way screening works is that we critically analyze the stereotypes by their origins, beliefs and consequences for the people, because it aids on our relationships/integrity of society to prevent stereotypical attitudes/perceptions from potentially resulting in poorly informed grudges and negative outcomes on others. But both the Mr. Doodle and the CotF films also tells a message to people that creativity isn't innate for you, it's built/made by you (in live-action, or animation).Therefore, I would like to watch it again all for myself, as a painter.",True

In the movie, Mr. Doodle had a sharp interest of doodling sketches as his passion since his childhood dream. Then, as his doodling talent goes on, the obsession with doodle sketching may lead him to sense psychotic breaks from reality. The first thing that I liked about watching the film is that sketching and drawing evoke artistic visions of one's desires and he always uses doodles with figments of his own imagination, in the form of Graffiti Spaghetti, just like I tend to do. But, it's also because his compulsions of drawing makes me think of uncontrollably fidgeting with writing pencils and pens when I was a little child, even as a painting artist. I also liked that, even if geniuses can sometimes go crazy upon themselves from reality, they can still establish their creativities for the most of the societal circumstances. This carries out some powers to articulate my belief/personality of being an artist as well as the others for the better. The only negative thing about it is the narrative complexity that needs patience from the readers to fully understand what Mr. Doodle's disability/obsession has impacted his life.The film really fits into the tropes of Code of the Freaks by Chasnoff and Screening Stereotypes by Longmore because, when we screen stereotypes, we are identifying and resolving some problems of stereotypical behaviors based on their oversimplified imageries/beliefs/race of that person/group.

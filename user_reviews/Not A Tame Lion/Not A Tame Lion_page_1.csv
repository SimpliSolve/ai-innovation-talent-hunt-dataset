1,9,"Vital Piece of History, Fascinating Man",pboswell-14096,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was privileged to see the film at the Arlington International Film Festival, where it was very warmly received and generated numerous questions and comments from the audience. The film captures both the pivotal moment in history in which John Boswell played such a major part and the driving forces behind Boswell's work. Interviews with colleagues, family, and historians attest to the incredible impact Boswell had--not only on the acceptance of gay Christians by their church but on the modern acceptance of gay marriage in the United States and many North American and European countries. Anecdotes shared by those who knew him revealed his personal faith, his commitment to scholarship, and his charm and wit. Boswell was a superb scholar, teacher, advocate, and friend, whose story is now, finally, being known and shared.",False
2,10,Wow! This is a piece of history not talked about in many places,spbmba-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was excellent in giving both the educational and personal sides of John Boswell. It is sad that he is not alive today, as I am sure he would be force to be reckoned with in support of gay liberties. I am amazed at how much of the information contained in this wonderful film was very new to me. The movie is great at showing how John's faith and personal convictions worked together, not only as a gay Christian, but as a seeker of knowledge.The interviews with John's friends and colleagues show John was a man of many dimensions. Not only is there a lot of information given, it is done in a caring and often humorous way. Of course, the untimely death of John Boswell is mentioned with appropriate reverence.It would be great to have this movie seen by many people. So many NEED to see it.",False
3,9,Excellent review of my brother's life and work,wrayboswell,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though I am a participant in one of the interviews in this movie, I was prepared to be critical if necessary of the finished project. He was a complicated man in a complicated time, but Craig Bettendorf and company did an outstanding job of presenting his life and work. I am pleased and grateful as are other family members who have seen it. Growing up mostly in a small southern town in the 50's and 60's none of our family had any real understanding of what challenges he was dealing with but we could see his astonishing intellect. We are proud of what he accomplished and are pleased to see a younger generation recognizing his contributions.",False
4,10,Fascinating and worth watching,joeysbarandgrill,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's many layers to this fascinating documentary. Yes, it's about John Boswell, but it also addresses the history of the Bible, church, and the acknowledgement of gay marriage in the church. It also reminds the viewer of the era when John lived, the battles that were waged (and continue) and also how John saw things - given his exposure to the vast history. There are some great stories about John, his work, and his friends & family. Put your smartphone down for a few minutes, watch this important documentary to expand your mind, and learn about an important person in history. Finally, it has sad moments, but moments of humor - so it's not a boring documentary in any way.",False
5,9,A Heartfelt Tribute,Indigirlproductions,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bettendorf's documentary interweaves first-hand accounts from Boswell's colleagues, students, friends, and family with footage depicting the era. It was a time when people such as Jerry Falwell and Newt Gingrich used fearmongering to fuel their agenda against homosexuality.Bettendorf features candid conversations with those who knew Boswell, effectively bringing home the scholar's impact on the LGBTQ and religious communities. ""Not a Tame Lion"" dives into Boswell's scholarly work and discovery of ideas on homosexuality and marriage that were essentially written out of history.The documentary recounts how modern ideology and politics made the acknowledgment of gay history in the Catholic church unacceptable. Bettendorf uses a few staged scenes to depict what it must have been like for Boswell as he made his discoveries. For me, the interviews and historical footage do the best work of helping the audience understand what a tremendous effort this must have been-even dangerous because of the in time in which it took place.""Not a Tame Lion"" is certainly worth watching, for gay, straight, Christians, and non-Christians. At its heart, it's a story of how necessary tolerance and acceptance are in a world where bigotry and hatred can lead to violence, corruption, and even stall advances in medicine.",False

1,10,Absolutely amazing!,didafetz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is absolutely the Bulgarian ""Green Street Hooligans"" as pure and natural as it could be. Great retrospection of the history of the city of Pernik. The film is a tale about the local football club fans, described in a very professional ans natural way, the film doesn't make you like or dislike the main characters, but it leaves for the viewer himself to judge. At the same time you could see the heart and soul of these poeple often rejected by society claimed as skinheads, drug dealers and criminals. It is rare to see nowadays a movie shot in such a direct way, without censoring and hiding many scenes of violence, hateful speech etc. That really makes this fim extraoridnary and natural, realistic picture of a whole social circle that is rarely being shown on the big screen.",False
2,10,What a movie!,nikibezov-84660,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie shows us the ultras fan culture in Bulgaria. We can learn a lot about it. Everything about this movie is very good! They showed us that in this groups everyone is a family, and they will support each other no matter what. The movie shows that one middtable football club can make such an impact on the fans and the city! I really liked this movie and hope there will be more in the future! Keep the great work! I hope we can see some other documentaries like that but for the others countries, to see their culture, their passion and what are they ready to give for their so beloved club. Best regards from Russia.",False

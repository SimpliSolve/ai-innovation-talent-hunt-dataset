1,9,The best documentary that any mexican should see,JacklandStudios83,n/a,16/08/2025,"Olallo Rubio's latest effort brings more questions than answers, as (in my opinion) every good documentary should do.As a whole, the film is solid with a good narrative, pacing, and awesome music. It's always amazing to me Olallo's ability to find incredibly rare footage that conveys the perfect moment in the narrative.If I have a complaint is that it's a bit too short (peaking at 70 min plus credits) and that's on top of some padding at the beginning that the film could've done without. But since there was already a lot mentioned about Mexico's political history in one of his previous documentaries ""Gimme the Power"", I think he just didn't want to repeat himself.With an insightful look at the true nature of a nation lost to historical lies and myths, it dares every Mexican like me, to challenge ourselves and really question how much we really know about our past. Unfortunately, it doesn't leave us with a lot of resources to do it but our own means.",False
2,10,A myth come true,helariuberta,n/a,16/08/2025,"The naturalness of telling and transmitting facts, events, myths about our Mexican culture, in addition to recreating it with the good humor that characterizes Olallo Rubio, simply makes it a documentary with the context that we know, we know seen from the most subtle angle and not could miss the music that makes us vibrate all our senses.",False

1,9,Mystic Maya is Masterful,stevehume-78-989924,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a filmmaker myself, I am duly impressed with Mystic Maya. It is an obvious work of love and devotion that transmits a profound knowing.Although I am not a scholar of the Maya, I feel that I learned a great deal. The lineage holders represented in this film speak their truths from their own experiences. I was impressed that the filmmaker chose to not include narration and rather carry the story with the first person narrative.I have a substantial background in the western mystery schools and can attest that this film does service to the lineages that it discusses. I cut my teeth producing public access films on the kabbalah dating back to the early 1980's.",False

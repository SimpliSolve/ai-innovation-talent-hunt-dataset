1,4,2005 SyFy channel called... they want their show back,kbtoys100,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tubi has been putting out a number of true crime/paranormal documentaries lately such as Americas Most Haunted: Amityville, Fresh Meat: Jeffrey Dahmer and now Americas Scariest Monsters. Having watched them all I can say they keep getting worse.The current trend in these type of documentaries is a more slow, dreadful approach. Tubi however says forget all that, we're going to edit our documentaries in a style that was popular in the late nineties and early aughts - the hyper-edited, fast paced style.They also continue to use 'social media influencers' as the majority of their interviews which basically consists of these people just regurgitating what they read off Wikipedia and saying ""ooh how spooky"".Just like the other Tubi docs, if you want to actually learn anything, you won't here. 10 cryptid stories across 85 minutes, you do the math.Put it on only if you want something in the background.",False
2,5,"Not bad, not good either.",spiderbyte101,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is interesting to have on but not much. I normally don't watch cryptids but it did remind me of those old scyfy/animal planet countdowns. Some of these I didn't know but was a good introduction to them. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants an introduction to these monsters and you can search more stories yourself. I have included the countdown list so you don't have to watch it if you do not have the time. The people they interviewed are social influencer and other clout chasers so I wouldn't put them as experts on folklore.10. Chupacabra - Texas
09. Black Eyed Children - Vermont
08. Oklahoma Octopus - Oklahoma
07. Rougarou - Louisiana
06. Jersey Devil - New Jersey
05. The Bell Witch - Tennessee
04. Mothman - West Virginia
03. La Llorona - Arizona
02. Wendigo - Minnesota
01. Big Foot - Washington.",True
3,6,A fun watch,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerChupacabra! Black-eyed children! The Oklahoma octopus! Rougarou! The Bell Witch! Jersey Devil! La Llorona! Wendigo! Mothman! Bigfoot! Yes, that Tubi exclusive fever hit me again and this time, I was in no way disappointed.Written by Adam Meyer, this movie assembles a series of cryptozoological experts like folklore researcher Camille Acosta, researcher of the weird Chad Lewis, Cryptid Campfire podcast host Eli Watson, content creators Ashlynn Kamps, influencer Alyssa Phenix, folklore researchers Sara Burdoff and Zelia Edgar, retired FBI special agent John DeSouza, The Black Eyed Children writer David Weatherly, Nashville Demystified podcast host Alex Steed, Bell family descendent Kenneth Hayes, La Llorona: Ghost Stories of the Southwest author Rodarte, founder of the She-Squatchers Jen Kruse, a group of Bigfoot festivalgoers to discover just who or what is America's scariest monster and my favorite talking head in this movie, The African American Folklorist podcast host Lamont Pearley Sr., who does a great job explaining so many of these creatures and his voice is a genuine joy to listen to!If you've watched enough list-based shows on basic cable, you know what you're getting into. That said, this is a tight and well-put-together show that breezes by and gives you just enough info to get excited about the subject or happy that your favorite cryptid has been included.The whole black eyes children part had me freak out yet happy that I watched this at one in the afternoon instead of my normal one in the morning. I probably still won't sleep all that well, which will allow me to write about more movies.",True
4,2,Nothing spectacular same old,dancingtreespirits,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe only thing new here is the kids. I mean ""experts"" and ""researchers"". The same monsters have been shared along with the same newspaper clippings and news clips in every paranormal show in existence. The young adults who talk on this show were still in kindergarten when these things happened. They added some new drawings and computer cgi stuff in the mix. But no don't waste your time. There's nothing new and exciting and it's disappointed.",True
5,1,Absolutely awful boring,kinginexilement,n/a,16/08/2025,The trailer made this look semi interesting but after watching it I must admit this show absolutely sucks...They show random footage but fail to explain what and where this footage is or who captured it...The narrative is annoyingly typical..Awful production if you ask me.this is a great subject matter but lacks anything that would be even remotely interesting...It is based on urban legends and folklore more than on actual encounters and all the encounters are haphazardly thrown into the already nerve wracking script so you never really get a grasp or any real understanding of with you are looking at.,False
6,1,I'm sorry what,martinsmith-47732,n/a,16/08/2025,"Could whoever produced this consider having a word with the President of the USA to maybe make an ""American"" national anthem, then you can leave the ""British"" national anthem out of your 'murica the great' opening, says alot that this got past Everybody!",False
7,7,"While nothing new, it's another fun entry in the cryptozoology genre with well done visuals.",tresm87,n/a,16/08/2025,"Essentially a mixture of The Lost Tapes and the UnXplained series combined for a full length Doc. While the ""experts"" are absolutely pitifully comical with their supreme insights, the visuals are actually well put together. A mixture of updated creature CGI renderings as well as ominous camera work/reenactments keeps crypto fans intrigued.",False
8,2,Nitpicked more than enjoyed it,celiamevious,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst and foremost, I LOVE American folklore and cryptids. This didn't challenge people to consider the existence of these creatures, instead presenting everything as fact and omitting the very idea of a counterargument. Last ten or fifteen minutes is just documenting a bunch of people that hunt for Bigfoot, never really going into Bigfoot's origins.Tl;dr it doesn't really teach you about cryptids, instead selling you on the general idea of them.",True
9,6,A nice introduction for those who are unaware.,rcr-37510,n/a,16/08/2025,"This wasn't terrible but not groundbreaking either. It's a basic documentary covering all of the most well-known cryptids. Just an overview really without going into a lot of depth. There's not much new here for those of us who are into this kind of thing but it's a good introduction for someone less interested as a casual watch.Many speakers are reputable, but some of their sources are of dubious credentials or seemingly ill suited to talk with any authority. That's one complaint I had. Along with authors and folklore researchers on this topic, they include others with titles such as ""content creator"" and ""social media influencer."" Why do I care what they have to say about cryptids?Also as I stated before, I just wished they would have gone into the stories a little deeper to get those interesting, lesser known, local kind of facts.For example, they have a segment about the Jersey Devil. That's in my backyard about 30 minutes away. What they don't tell you is that we still have people here descendant from the original Leeds family living in the area. They are actually ""related"" to the Jersey Devil. And you can still go to find the house where the Devil was born. The actual structure is mostly wrecked but the foundation and grounds are intact. Last I checked anyway, some 20 years ago.Small things like that could have made the documentary more colorful. Maybe all of that wouldn't fit into the runtime.Anyway, that's all. It's worth watching if you're curious or have somebody you'd like to introduce to cryptids. If you've been intimately acquainted with the subject, just don't expect anything extraordinary.",False
10,5,"Creepy, scary creatures!",michaelRokeefe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWe all have them. Every state in America has fables, legends and supposed sightings of scary monsters. They have hoofed feet, sharp teeth, razor sharp fingered claws and jagged antlers. Are they hybrid wolves, pigs, birds or dogs.? They can scratch, bite, squeeze and suck your blood. They can mangle and rob your animals of their entrails.Call them by name: Chupacabra, Rougarou, Windigo, Oklahoma Octopus, Jersey Devil, La llorona, Mothman, Michigan Dogman, Bigfoot and the Bell Witch.All of these scary creatures are said to bleed blood and would love to let you be their lunch/dinner.",True
11,10,Much better than many comperable documentaries,ecmelton-186-105049,n/a,16/08/2025,"A lot of the paranormal and cryptozoological documentaries you find on streaming are painfully boring and way too drawn out. Scariest Monsters in America avoids this by having absolutley no filler. There's no investigations where nothing happens or heavily teased evidence that also amounts to nothing. The program simply talks about the featured legends and then moves on organically, which is so refreshing. You see that on podcast and Youtube videos, but actual movies and specials are rarely so concise.I would also describe this as a bit of a throwback to the cozy monster documentaries that aired on the Discovery Channel in the late '90s. It's not super comprehensive on the folklore, and if you have even a passing interest in this subject matter, there's probably very little that would be new to you, but it's a fun thing to curl up and watch. Tubi once agian exceeds my expectations.",False
12,10,Watch it!,hhwgvrtqd,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is by far one of the best movies/documentaries that I have seen about cryptids.I have have watched more docs than I can count and many I don't even make it more than 1/4 the way through because I could tell they're not being sincere about their stories.This doc is being told by experts (it shows their credentials) and by people who've actually studied them or had run-ins with them. These people really know what they're talking about.This show contains the top ten scariest cryptids, where they're located & gives you information about them. There are so many out there and seeing my location on there as one of the top ten is quite eerie.I haven't checked out other selections but I really hope they have more in this series.",True

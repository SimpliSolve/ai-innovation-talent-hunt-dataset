1,10,Beautifully Told Story,brookebee31575,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is entertaining even for the individuals who aren't documentary fans. The movie tells the story of and takes you on the journey through the interesting and unlikely story of photographer Ricky Powell. For most people their introduction to Ricky would be through the Beastie Boys or his popular public access show Rappin With the Rickster, this documentary provides a glimpse at the beginning middle and end of a prolific photographers life. The cast of interviewees is a star studded who's who of 80's & 90's NYC music and dance scene. The animation and choice of music submerges you into the stories and make you feel like you were actually there. Highly recommend checking this out, I have yet to meet someone who didn't enjoy it.",False
2,10,One of the best films,freshpressk,n/a,16/08/2025,This was just an electric film from start to finish. Truly a work of art. It definitely had some dark moments and there are some battles that were tough to witness Ricky go through but I just found it so inspiring to watch this story.,False
3,10,Terrific 10 out of 10.,dtrobb,n/a,16/08/2025,"So rare that I can watch an entire movie at one sitting. This one clocks in at an hour and 50 mins. How good is it? No trouble watching start to finish.You've read what the story is about. So, no need to go there. Some takeaways.1. More than once it was mentioned Rickey's photos captured seminal moments in the beginnings of the hip hop scene. For those in attendance it is their collective '60's. Just different music and clothes. Thinking that 60's era types like me look at that scene much like 50's era folks look at the post Elvis rock/folk/psych/garage music. Not favorably.2. Rickey is a good photographer, for sure. And a super likeable, charming, unique character. Fun to be around. But, something tells me his main role for the bands he toured with was procuring the drugs. They were able to eventually move on. He wasn't.3. Fantastic on location filming of lower Manhattan.4. He's a party guy. Everybody loves him. I get it. (except his Mom) To me, he's just a loser drug addict with a camera. Not going out on a limb to say he was likely high from one thing or another every waking second of his life from a young age till the heart attack. Makes an interesting story. But, not worth glorifying.5. Rickey grew up pretty much unsupervised on lower 5th Ave - if we can take him at his word about his Mom's indifference. He says he had the run of the city. That is a flat out insane upbringing.6. I've got to give Rickey way more slack and credit for becoming who he became and move past the drug thing.",False

5,10,Fantastic portrayal of an artist!,jen-90346,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film portrays the highs and lows of a prolific photographer in lower Manhattan without the filters. The struggle is real, the portrayal is raw and beautiful and it touches one's soul.",False
6,10,Beastie Boys and Ricky Powell,bcbartley,n/a,16/08/2025,We really enjoyed this heartfelt documentary. It is a true New York story. Ricky had that charmer personality and the talent to portray in photos an exact time in NYC history. The documentarian really captured his struggle and his magic connection to people. So sorry Ricky is not here to enjoy it.,False
7,n/a,Freedom of self,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Ricky was a nobody that everybody loved. It was great to see how someone can capture art and see things in people. Also shows that drugs are bad but a part of his creative process. Eventually you have to get out from them fast to get a second shot.,False

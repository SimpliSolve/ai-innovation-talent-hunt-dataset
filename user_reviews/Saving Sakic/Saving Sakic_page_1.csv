1,7,Good for Sakic and Avs Fans,davidjkobb,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're an Avs or Sakic fan, this is a good watch. It gets into lesser known details about the famous, in Colorado at least, offer sheet extended by New New York to Sakic.The movie explores how the movie Airforce One had a role in how the Avs ownership was able to find a way to keep Joe in Colorado. Various reporters and the leadership of the Avs and Rangers from that time talk about the details leading up to the signing of the offer sheet and what happened in the seven days the Avs had to counter and keep Burnaby Joe.It's a quick film, just 48 minutes. It is lessened by not taking enough time to develop just who Sakic was as a player and develop why he was so valuable and this, I think, hampered the documentary's overall impact. It would have also been interesting if there had been interviews with Colorado and Ranger players of the time about how they were feeling when they heard the news that Joe might be going to New York. It also would have helped the documentary get to a more substantial runtime.Overall, as an Avs fan and Joe worshiper, I enjoyed hearing some details and from some characters of which I was previously unaware. As a documentary, though, it felt amateurish, and unfinished.",False
2,5,Meh,mikeborgen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerUnnecessarily long could have been told in 10 minutes and it wasn't that riveting.If they didn't rope in Harrison Ford into the story it could have been told in five minutes. I could see the pitch now yeah so that's the basic story what else, well Harrison Ford and his money making movie made this possible okay let's milk that for another 30 minutesUsually these documentaries are fabulous I was expecting a little bit more to the story but it was pretty basic and didn't necessarily need a documentary about it.I'm all for hockey related docs, just this one seemed like a pretty shallow plot.",True

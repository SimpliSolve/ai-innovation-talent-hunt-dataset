1,7,More dog stories PLEASE!! Loved it!,Stellarose321,n/a,15/08/2025,Nice documentary considering the challenges of shooting through the pandemic. Wasn't sure about the virtual interviews at first but they were pretty creatively done and I could tell a lot of care and heart went into the making of this film. Dogs make everything better!,False

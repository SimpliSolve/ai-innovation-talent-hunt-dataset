1,7,Fascinating Study of Faith and Belief,thalassafischer,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed the first episode because it emphasizes the recent history of the Notre Dame fire in Paris 2019 (which won't open again until Christmas of this year - 2024) so it felt timely and extremely human, as the world did watch in horror as the wooden and lead roof of a UNESCO World Heritage Site threatened to rob present and future generations of an epic piece of history, as it also poisoned the tourists of France.It was so fascinating to listen to the firemen who volunteered to fight the fire from WITHIN the burning cathedral, potentially sacrificing their own lives to keep the entire structure from being ruined and collapsing. These critical volunteers were also exposed to more of the 13th century lead, and one in particular tells the story of how he literally saved the Crown of Thorns.It's really breathtaking, no matter your religion or lack thereof.Overall, this series makes a strong statement to the power of people's faith, no matter your opinion of the relics themselves.",False
2,1,"Disorganized, confused, and incomplete",peterwall-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show makes little sense. Each of the episodes purports to have a theme, but then doesn't stick to it. There is no apparent reason for why it jumps around between topics.And it never really asks the questions that might make it profound, or just interesting. The experts are not well-used at all. Certainly there could be an interesting presentation of the practice of presence in Christianity-historically, practically, theologically, and so on. But this show never bothers to do much but make a display of just ever so lightly scratching the surface of these matters. No mysteries are really presented in their full depth. There are a handful of glimpses at something interesting, and why meanings have such a hold despite facts, but those glimpses are not enough to sustain four episodes.",False
3,1,"Idols, idols idols!",peggysue422,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, we aren't supposed to worship objects, which is what they're talking about with the Holy Grail and the crown of thorns. Christians can speak to God anytime, anywhere and don't need relics or pilgrimages to do so. He is with us all the time. (Matt. 28:20) I would go so far as to say that these so-called ""relics,"" were NOT actually a part of Jesus' life. The crown of thorns was ""rediscovered"" in the private chapel of an Emperor and that smacks of greed right there!They are obviously just making money off of it and if Jesus were alive today, he would go in and upturn the tables again, bc they are ""turning a house of prayer into a den of thieves"" once more. I wish the fire HAD destroyed it! One episode of idol worship was plenty enough for me.",False
4,9,Excellent,erhanipekciler,n/a,16/08/2025,"Perfect for me. In last year. I really love Netflix documentaries and this is another good example of course if you like this genre. First of all I loved the cinematography and narration. Story line is very cool and it doesn't bother you, when you start to watch, you can learn but also you can live in it. I really cried in first episode. It was so emotional. I am not a Christian but I really felt the tension. First episode was like a thriller movie. I also didn't know crowne was in Notre Dame also I had no idea that it was in Constantinapolis before. Anyway it was good and watchable. Also it is really short,so you can finish it quickly.",False

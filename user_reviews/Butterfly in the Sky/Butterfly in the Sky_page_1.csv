1,10,This movie will transport you to a magical place,prberg2,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow. Saw this movie last night in the theater with a full audience and was a magical and special experience. I will say that I did watch Reading Rainbow as a kid.. so this movie really touched me on a deep emotional level. But just as a great movie.. it delivers there as well. Even if you just value books and reading.. this movie will inspire you too. Movie was put together in a very effective way. Music was awesome, and the clips they found were just perfect. It reminds you how somethings in life are really, really special and to not forget to cherish them.. as they might not be around forever. Just a very inspirational story and movie. Of course LeVar Burton is great... but I learned alot about him, the show, and the impact it had on the world. Check it out.. and I'll see you next time!",False
2,10,Nostalgic Gem,pdxqraj,n/a,15/08/2025,"Reading Rainbow was integral to my youth and setting me on a path of critical thinking. The producers of this classic, educational show for children made reading books as interesting as watching a Saturday morning cartoon.I looked forward to watching this show at school during a daily carve out in the morning or afternoon. Levar and his young guests were awe inspiring. The diverse and eclectic mix of students and book topics made all fell welcome. Reading Rainbow, the Scholastic Book Fair and Pizza Hut Book-it were my juvenile, beloved Trinity.As a part of the local PBS broadcasting, Reading Rainbow touched the hearts of children everywhere, sharing stories of which many may have never been exposed. Thank you for unlocking a piece of my childhood!",False
3,10,"Amazing documentary showing the making of the beloved children's show ""Reading Rainbow""!",shannonjones-71632,n/a,15/08/2025,"Reading rainbow was a staple of my childhood along with Mr Rodger's. Lavar Burton instilled a passion about reading that I only ever got from my mama. That show connected kids with the greater world and showed us how to use our imagination when we read. This severely helped with reading comprehension as a child. It is a shame that our children now days do not have those same role models and mentors to explore with. I just watched the documentary ""Butterfly in the sky"" about the making of Reading Rainbow. I think I smiled thru the entire thing. If this show made an impact on you, I highly recommend you watch it.",False

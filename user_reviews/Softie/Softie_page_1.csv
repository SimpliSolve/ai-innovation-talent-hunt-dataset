Definitely, the film is not soft.",False
2,10,"Eye opening, thought provoking look at politics in Kenya",victormurage,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film looks at politics and human rights issues in Kenya from the perspective of a Kenyan human rights and political activist. It looks at the challenges that activists face, how corruption plays a role in Kenyan politics/elections and the price that their families pay in the pursuit of a just and fair society.For anyone who thinks we can be indifferent about who we put in power and what our leaders do, this is a sobering reminder that's there's a cost to our choices and the price, though sometimes deferred, is always paid.",False

1,10,Brilliant and gentle,ilaliberte,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such a kind and beautiful profile of a gentle sweet man, and of his wonderful book which really helped so many of us.I found the film very inspiring, showing us his process, and the thousands of drawings that he made over the years to get to a unique book like his. I also think it's fabulous that the film is done with his linework and looks like a drawing, not like a Pixar product; it's what gives it its power.By the way, I totally disagree with the other review: it is not stretched out or just made to fill up air space. Rather a cynical view if such a beautiful film. I really recommend it, well worth it, especially after watching the actual film.Vulnerability wins. Thank you, Charlie.",False
2,10,"Beautifully written, timed and animated.",bspacker,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a children's show that speaks to all ages. My little grandchildren love it and so do my adult children. The wisdom is clear, full of very quotable quotes. The animation is sweet in its rough edges. Feels like part of the poetry of life - all of us have rough edges, and it's ok.I hadn't read the book when I simply happened upon the short film on AppleTV. I clicked to see if it would be a new movie to watch with grandkids and found myself weeping as I watched. It captures the purity of understanding, kindness, compassion, friendship, love and it reminds humanity of who and what we can be.",False
3,10,"Beautiful, powerful, and motivational.",nicolempownall,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie was absolutely gorgeous. The theme of it was beyond impactful. I'm nineteen years old and enjoyed every second of this film as much as I would if I were in my thirties, or even a young child again. The message behind it is incredible; genuinely brought tears to my eyes. I can't wait to show this film to my family, and I'm quite sure everyone on the planet should see it solely because of the message. Heavy emphasis on the fox, too, his perspective was entirely changed, as mine was after seeing this. It's genuinely such a gorgeous piece, and I can't wait to watch it again in the near future.",False
4,4,"Charlie Mackesy: The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, the Horse and Me",studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought this was a nice companion piece to the film version of 'The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, the Horse' book, written by Charlie Mackesy.He seems like a decent bloke, and it was interesting to hear about his life, his influences etc.I did think that this was very much a DVD extra type feature that only made it to the schedules to bulk them out around Christmas time, and also that it was stretched a bit thinly to make it last an hour.A nice slick half hour run time instead I think would have worked much better, and some of the details could have been honed in on a bit more.On the whole though this was fine, just overlong.",False

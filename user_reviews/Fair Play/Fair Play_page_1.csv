1,10,"An extremely important topic, brilliantly discussed",k0mbucha,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary covers a critical topic of discussion - fairness in household management and childcare - which doesn't get covered enough, and it does so in a very insightful and, at times, funny way. I very much enjoyed watching it and left with an informed perspective on the subject. America is so far behind on this topic (literally - in one example, all other countries save for the US and Papua New Guinea, as of the time of writing, were ahead on the topic). Kudos to the team behind the documentary, the experts who participated in it, and the couples who shared their experiences. This should be a must-watch in all US households.",False
2,n/a,Documentary of the Year,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Best documentary I've seen in some time! What is a partnership and why is it important for each partner to take ownership in their home roles and stop pretending office jobs are harder than being a full time, 24 hours on, no days off, 7 days a week parent. If someone has to delegate responsibilities of you caring for a child, you don't deserve one. Period.I found the movie to be funny and light considering the subject. Men have got to do better or not call themselves men. Women have had careers and juggled home duties as well. No excuses. It's about time someone brought this subject into the spotlight.",False

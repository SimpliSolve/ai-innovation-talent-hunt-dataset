1,8,Three filmmakers deliver a quality documentary,derekadrouillard,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gripping & touching telling of the failures of the system and cultural practices that aren't just offensive but continuing ruination of the impoverished.Told in three different episodes, each taking a personal approach to telling real stories about their experiences while living in the state of Texas. Richard Linklater and the Texas Prison system is episode one, Alex Stapleton takes on the Texas Oil industry in episode two, Iliana Sosa tackles the fluidity of life in El Paso's border.It's not a politically driven documentary, yes it does mention political affiliations because of context but the facts are represented as opposed to political objective.In my opinion, the filmmakers attempt to open the conversation about the topics that too many turn a blind eye. If only so that we can begin that conversation.",False
2,8,"God Save Texas, Episode 1: Richard Linklater",dfloro,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm doing something I rarely ever do: I'm writing a review of a limited series (documentary, in this case) after just the first of three episodes. Why? Because the installments are each by a different Texas director, and the first is one of my favorite directors of recent decades, Richard Linklater, with whose work I am very intimately familiar (from 1993's Dazed and Confused to 2014's Boyhood). He grew up with a strong, single Mom in the prison town of Huntsville, Texas, in which more condemned inmates have been executed than any other town anywhere in these United States. About which many Texans still enamored with frontier justice would say, ""Hail and Bravo!"" Others explain that humans don't get to play God with the lives of other humans on Earth! Whatever you may believe, it's fascinating stuff. I'll return to update this post once I've seen it all.",False
3,5,History of Select Minority Injustices in Texas,Alwyzfishn,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThese 3 Episodes reflect many historical injustices that hopefully are not happening anymore and should all be corrected. All of these document exposure of very bad historical events but do not offer any positive discussion on any solutions to problems still in 2024.In Episode 1, Home Town Prison did show Huntsville in a good light with the prison's being the major employer. The discussion on Capital Punishment was bery one sided as i do not recall any interviews with victoms families.In Episode 2, The Price of Oil shows the expansion of industrial Oil and Chemical Plants into the residential areas in and around Houston, which should never have been allowed. Blame the Mayors, City Councils, and Zoning elected officials as they let it happen. I believe, the residents in their homes should have been met with and all of them financially taken care of to allow them to relocate safely away from the existing plants and any future expansion.In Episode 3, La Frontera, featuring the city of El Paso was shown in a very one sided view on the increase of illegal immigration these last few years. The discussion on the Mass Shooting in 2029, at the Walmart blamed President Trump, which was absolutely absurd and so not true and very poor reporting of the real problems in El Paso.",True

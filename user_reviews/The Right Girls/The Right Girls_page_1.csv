1,8,"Review Bombed, Good Doc on Latina Trans Women",simultzscha,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's not surprising to see the rating. Make sure to click the rating out of ten to see the actual dispersion of ratings (and you'll see 30 trolls have a 1 star).In reality, this movie is about 3 latina trans women who are pre-transition making the trek through Mexico with the immigrant caravan to get to the States (while Trump was president). They go through various fights, harassment, joys and pains.The movie does a good job at capturing the little moments with LGBTQ folks in the caravan through a church service, hailing trucks, and more. It's a story not usually seen in the news, since it's such a large amount of people, news stories just focus on that, the amount. But if we looker deeper, along with this documentary, we can see these people aren't just numbers at the border, but actual people who are striving for new lives. And this becomes particularly important for trans folks.",False
2,9,Ignore the 30 one star reviews. Watch it and see for yourself.,njferns,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was compelled to write a review for this after seeing that it's only got one review. :( It was lovely to watch this sisterhood of trans women from El Salvador and Honduras supporting each other throughout their journey to seek asylum in the US. Witness the joys they celebrate and the struggles they face (despite cameras being around, so I can only imagine what it might be otherwise).The ending was a bit soured for me due to some drama that seems to occur within the group, and sadly we don't see an update for two of the girls. However, this shouldn't dissuade you from watching it to understand and empathize with what trans communities globally need to endure each day.",False

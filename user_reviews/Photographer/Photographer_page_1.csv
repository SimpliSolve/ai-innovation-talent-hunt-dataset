1,10,This series is phenomenal!,giraffejm,n/a,16/08/2025,"National Geographic has compiled this series of episodes highlighting photographers in different genres of work.While each episode is different, the theme is the same - to reach the viewer on some level beyond the physical object. Each episode of this series is so unique and so riveting. I have been profoundly touched in experiencing the behind the scenes of each of the photographers highlighted in this series from their perspective. I am truly appreciative of the art of photography and look to experience the capture of a moment vs. Looking at a pretty picture. I have thoroughly enjoyed this series and look forward to many more stories in this series.",False

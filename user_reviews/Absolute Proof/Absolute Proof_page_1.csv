1,2,"When you are looking for confirmation, you always find it.",wrighttodd,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary might be a Christopher Guest work, but no, Mike Lindell (linen entrepreneur, Trump confidante, documentation) is serious with this work. It's weak; too weak to be taken seriously. As I do not wish to provide suppliers, I shan't get into specific examples of absurd levels of confirmation bias, but they abound.""Absolute Proof"" is only strongly indicative of Mr. Lindell being a better purveyor of bed linen than quality documentaries. Unlike the opinion piece the movie is, there is good evidence to support my notion. As someone once said(this quote has been improperly cited as being uttered by many, but like many a good idea, it has legs) ""It's good to have an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out.""If you have 3 hours of your life to waste, I recommend you waste it elsewhere..If Mr. Lindell had delivered ""Proof"" in 30 minute format it would have been less intolerable, but at 6x that length, it's a must miss.",False

3,1,This is not the proof you're looking for,Texan_Since_93,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are one of those who believes the 2020 election was fraudulent and are looking for evidence to support that belief, then you'll probably be convinced by this video.If you do not believe that the election was fraudulent, you might be intrigued...But - If you have read all the articles and analysis by credible and reputable and factual and accurate sources, then you'll recognize that everything in this video has been discredited and disproven, and none of this has been shown to be credible. Not to mention that election officials in all 50 states certified their elections, following their laws and knowing full well how to conduct an election and recognize when fraud has occurred. And the Department of Justice (with Trump buddy Bill Barr) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency verified the security of the election. And Republican officials at all levels, including those on the record as being Trump supporters, have admitted that there is no basis in the claims of election fraud.If you believe that the election was fraudulent, however, nothing in the previous paragraph will convince you otherwise, and you'll latch on to these conspiracy theories by ""experts"" who have jobs at cool-sounding places and fancy degrees from top schools. Lindell does try to pull out all the stops to make this ""evidence"" sound credible. But this ""evidence"" is nothing more than disjointed info presented from a biased host and biased ""experts"" using valid terminology but totally taken out of context and delivered with tons of spin and with the confidence and conviction designed to fool those who really want to believe it and who do not have the knowledge of election processes and technology and the legal system to recognize that this just simply is not valid. It may sound convincing, but if you take the time to do your own fact checking, you can see for yourself.I watched this video 2+ times. First with an ""open mind"" - as open as it could be considering my bias. If I didn't already know from everything I'd seen the past three months (and I have seen a lot) that most of this info had been disproven and that these experts were hardly credible, yeah, I might have thought there was something there. The second time involved taking notes and searching each witness and claim. This absolutely confirmed what I already knew, and it destroyed the claims that were new to me - which apparently didn't even merit the usual fact-checking scrutiny, since really, everyone should have moved past this election long ago. And I spot-checked a few spots a third time. Yeah, this documentary is painful, and I spent too much time on it. But I challenge anyone who truly believes anything in it to give it the same scrutiny that I did. If you don't come to the same conclusion, then, I don't know if you can be helped.In summary, I really hope you see this video for what it is - a pathetic attempt to continue to spread disinformation about the 2020 election. There is nothing here that should convince you that it is indeed ""Absolute Proof"" - just a rehash of half-baked conspiracy theories that would not have a chance in any court if it could even meet the standard to be heard.UPDATE 2-22-2021 - Mike Lindell has been sued today by Dominion. He gets his wish. He seems to be giddy about it. I fully expect him to get destroyed in court.UPDATE 1-24-2022 - Wow, this documentary has not aged well... For everyone claiming that ""the truth will come out in time"", the only truth that has come out is that absolutely nothing that Loony Mike presents here is real. And I find it absolutely hilarious that there are absolutely zero user reviews for his second video in his election fraud fantasy series, ""Absolute Interference"". I have one absolutely blistering review sitting on my PC ready to be posted - but I find it more significant that the count remains at zero since it came out last April. (It's kinda fun overusing ""absolutely"" - I can see how Loony Mike gets off on it.)UPDATE 3-30-2023 - Another year, and nothing here has come remotely true to being proven true, has it? Does anyone still believe any of this? Do you folks who raved about this movie feel the least bit sheepish about believing it? Mike seems to be finally fading into irrelevancy.",False
4,1,Even as fiction has too many plot holes,edwardburch,n/a,16/08/2025,"The big reveal at the end is disappointment. First IP address I looked at was not near the location their list defined. Where the ""attack"" failed the list still states votes were changed.

5,1,Fact-Free Conspiracy Theories,Orchrist,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well, what can you expect? Mike Lindell's Shakespearean descent into insanity has been well documented, mostly by himself. This was undoubtedly the product of the same sad mind who claimed that ordering a military coup was the most patriotic thing Trump could do.Every single shred of so-called ""evidence"" this infomercial presents has been stomped on, destroyed, and debunked before. Lindell has the gall to bring on Melissa ""No, I Wasn't Drunk at the Michigan Hearing"" Carone to tell her self-aggrandizing fantasies about Michigan vote counting. At least she made Saturday Night Live as a result.Also prominently featured: Russell Ramsland, famous for conducting a ""forensic analysis"" that confused counties in different states, and a revival of the ""German servers held the smoking gun"" conspiracy theory that even QAnon has abandoned.What is equally weird is the music. Most of it sounds like student film horror movie material, but it is paced in the strangest places and with inappropriate volumes. Finally, Mr. Lindell states, repeatedly, that he expects his film to be so compelling, even Congress and the Supreme Court will see how Joe Biden is ""The Manchurian Candidate."" Pretty sure he is going to be disappointed about that one. The silver lining: the guests were cheap, and the production values so low, it must not have cost him too much.",False
6,1,Hilarious and Sad,billrabara,n/a,16/08/2025,"Delusion is tricky. If you an accept an argument based upon suspicion alone and then hold onto that belief and protect it as a mother would her children then you are well on your way to be delusional. The next step is fall waist deep into the logical fallacy of confirmation bias, Like quicksand you cannot escape but unlike quicksand you will not desire to escape. You revel in it. This 'documentary' is a textbook example of how delusion can take an otherwise healthy individual into a sickened mental state. The arguments are comically absurd to even my ten year old child.",False

8,1,Absolute Proof of No Absolute Proof,syllee,n/a,16/08/2025,"After sitting through this two-hour film, I am disappointed that there was absolutely nothing substantial that we haven't heard before.Mike Lindell desperately tries to make a mountain out of a mole hill. The problem is, there is no mole, much less a hill.In the end, I can't help but feel sorry for Mike Lindell. He is so desperate to believe that Trump won the election and that his ""proof"" is going to unite this country once again. As much as I too would love to see America united again, I'm afraid this film isn't going to do it.Bottom line, there was absolutely no proof to change anyone's mind on the 2020 election. You either believe Trump won or Biden won.",False
9,7,Mike Lindell My Pillow Documentary,chrisbrooks-19259,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary about the election fraud that happened during our last Presidental election. People are asking questions about if the election was fair? The issue is everyone is trying to sweep it under the rug, tech companies deleting videos and posts about it, most judges wont even take the case to review the evidence and even many local legislators not looking into the case, at least actually review the evidence. With allegations this serious, and a lot of valid evidence, it makes it worse that the government is trying to dodge the question.Mike Lindell, CEO of My Pillow, put together a documentary on evidence that he has uncovered about election fraud. I think he put it out as he felt no one would look into this VERY serious matter.No matter if you agree or disagree with his opinion I think everyone will agree that we MUST have elections in this country without fraud.",False

20,1,Absolute Crap,Galop_Inferno,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hot off my review of Roe v. Wade, I'm throwing away another couple hours of my boring existence on trashy ""cinema"", this time listening to ""businessman"" Mike Lindell and his unfounded claims (although he'll tell you otherwise) about the 2020 election. Featuring ""interviews"" with other politicians as deluded as him, it's an exact 120 minutes of BS, and not just that, but it's so ludicrous it could qualify for funniest ""movie"" of 2021.I know where I stand, and while my view on the state of the country may not be the best, it's the lesser of two evils. Lindell spends these ""interviews"" talking over the other person, constantly reiterating to the viewer whatever was just said, like a chatty parrot.How anyone with common sense can believe any of this is beyond me. Lindell is not only an incompetent ""businessman"" but also a really bad actor. His attempts to come off as shocked at the testimonies are downright hilarious. Every time he goes ""Wow!"" could be a drinking game that sends its player to the grave. The interviewes at the very least seem genuinely brainwashed.The editing changes scenes mid-sentence, the ""score"" is cheap if not FREE public domain music, it will endlessly remind you Mike Lindell is Mike Lindell and that you're watching Absolute Proof. Even if you happen to believe Lindell's nonsense, the final product would be better suited to the title Absolute Crap.",False
21,1,It's no wonder no court would listen to these arguments,evankearney,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't have high standards. I drive a 2011 VW Jetta with a huge dent in the front fender. I buy store label products. One time a fly landed in my beer and instead of fishing it out, I just drank around it. But when I watch a documentary, I do expect some level of diligence, like actually naming sources.This show starts with Mike Lindell desperately savaging the English language, throwing out random words in the hope that some will form some semblance of a sentence. To call the opening diatribe a 'word salad' would be an insult to salad. And I'm South African, so salad is already offensive enough. Note to Mike, if you ever do this again, consider writing a script first, and also consider having someone who isn't you going over it to make sure it makes sense.He then throws up a series of unsourced charts which he declares to be definitive proof that the election was fraudulent. He lists numbers of dead people who have admitted to voting, illegal aliens, babies and felons who have voted, usually having done so in surprisingly well rounded figures. The fact that, in Nevada, there were exactly 4000 illegal aliens who voted, 15,000 people (no more, no less) who voted twice by absentee ballot and precisely 130,000 mail in ballots whose signatures were not of a high enough definition to be verified is exceedingly thoughtful of the election riggers, meaning that all these numbers could be tabulated without the need for a calculator. Not only are there no sources presented for any of these numbers, but he also declares that every single one of these votes were cast for Biden. Although if you're presenting unsourced charts that are completely unverifiable, I guess you might as well go all out.Mike then gets into the only part of his opening segment that can actually be verified, the call between Trump and Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia Secretary of State. And despite the fact that the transcript and audio recording of this call is available for the entire world to see and hear, Mike decides to add extra parts in that were never said by anyone. Why Mike, why? We can already see you're lying and you're not even 10 minutes into your film. And this is the highpoint.After that, things start to do downhill fast. A bunch of people come on screen and make even more unsubstantiated declarations.""China did lots of stuff and now I'm going to spend 10 minutes saying that over and over again."" ""Thanks Phil, don't bother presenting anything that might be considered evidence, just pretend this is a 2 hour long Facebook post.""""In 2018 there was clear evidence of voter fraud in Texas, although I'm not going to present what that evidence was, or acknowledge that 2018 isn't 2020 and Trump won Texas.""And so on and so on. Lots that was 'horrifying, 'shocking' and 'terrifying,' but not a single shred of evidence of any of it. As I said, I don't have high standards, but I do expect a documentary to present evidence and sources, not just a bunch of talking heads. Although I will agree with one of the points Mike makes, albeit in his usual ineloquent, jumbled manner:""This is the most attack on America, ever.""",True

23,1,Beyond insane.,mathiassorrow,n/a,16/08/2025,"So, if you're one of those raving lunatics that actually buy this garbage, consider the following...
You believe that a US presidential election was 'rigged' during the reign of the most paranoid, egotistical, wannabe dictator ever to enter the Oval Office and, despite having replaced the heads of US intelligence agencies with his own handpicked sycophants, NOBODY noticed. That's right guys, you believe that the FBI, CIA, NSA, and even 'Space Force' didn't detect that the 'biggest plot in world history' was being planned for YEARS under the aforementioned president.Newsflash, Lindell's a bedding salesmen, with NO access to ANY US intelligence information/agencies.Take this 'movie' for what it is, absolutely WORTHLESS on every single level. No entertainment value, no humour (unless you like laughing at a severely mentally damaged lunatic destroying his own company) and CERTAINLY no proof that 2020 was any more corrupt than any prior election.The only people I feel sorry for are the people who work for Lindell who will shortly be out of a job when he loses his company to dominion.",False
24,1,Absolute Proof,jboothmillard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen the results of the Razzies were announced, this was one of the only movies I had not seen among those selected. Technically it is more of a television special broadcast than an actual feature film, but I was determined to watch it and find out why it received the negativity it did. The full title of the film is Absolute Proof: Exposing Election Fraud and the Theft of America by Enemies Foreign and Domestic. Basically, Mike Lindell (aka the ""My Pillow Guy"", winner of Worst Actor) is an American businessman, and the founder and CEO of My Pillow, Inc. (a pillow manufacturing company based in Chaska, Minnesota). Lindell purchased three hours of airtime on One America News Network, which had been threatened with legal action, to broadcast this documentary. In a newsroom style studio, Lindell talks about the 2020 Donald Trump/Joe Biden Presidential Election and claims to have proof that a cyberattack from the Chinese 'flipped' the result. OANN broadcast a lengthy disclaimer before the program saying the claims were Lindell's alone, but that the 2020 election results ""remain disputed and questioned by millions of Americans"". In the programme, Lindell starts with showing the ""Margin of Error"" for thousands of election votes, which he describes as a ""miracle"". He displays of list of ""fraudulent"" votes accepted in the states of Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia, and how many error votes there were under various categories. These (utterly ridiculous) categories included: ""Illegal aliens voting"", ""Votes loaded before opening of polls"", ""Dead people who voted"", ""Voters who double voted"", ""Voters who were known to have also voted in other states"", ""Fake ballots driven from New York to Pennsylvania"", ""Between 80 to 100 self-proclaimed Black Lives Matter-affiliated members"", ""Ballots accepted up to three days after the election"", ""Poll workers sorted ballots with various errors into bins. Poll workers then re-filled out these ballots so that they could be read by tabulation machines, an action contrary to state law"", ""Felons with incomplete sentences registered to vote and cast their vote"", ""Underage children registered to vote and illegally voted"", ""Unregistered voters who voted"", ""Voters who voted in Georgia and also voted in another state"", ""Voters voted in Georgia but changed their address before the election"", ""People voted who failed to re-register to vote in their new county in time after moving from one county to another"", ""Voters who registered too late to vote in the election"", and ""People who died prior to the election"". Lindell then speaks to Cybersecurity Expert Colonel Phi Waldron from a different studio who discusses the ""system vulnerabilities"", where machines could be hacked to change election outcomes, but this guy just goes on and on uninterrupted for over ten minutes. Next interviewed in another studio is Russ Ramsland, an expert of cyber forensics and security who specialises in election fraud, he says that he tried to get officials to investigate the results and that he is sure that the electronic voting system was compromised. Lindell is next joined in the studio by Dr. Shiva (Shiva Ayyadurai), expert on system science and pattern analysis, he has built large computer systems and shares the opinion that the machines used for polling could have been threatened and calls the computer algorithms a ""crime scene"". Lindell next talks in the studio to politician Patrick Colbeck, the former state senator in Michigan, who has become a poll challenger who believes that some machines were connected to internet, which they should not be, and this would allow attackers to 'flip' the election result. Next in the studio with Lindell is Melissa Carone, an IT contractor for Dominion Voting Systems on election day, who says she never saw a single vote for Trump and claims machines got jammed and could count votes more than once. Attorney Matt DePerno is next in the studio discussing his part of a lawsuit filed against the election result and voting equipment, he claims that recounts were made as adjudication files were deleted from the systems and shows how machines could be connected to the internet. Next there is an office interview from Eric Coomer, director of product strategy and security, at Dominion Voting Systems, who answers questions about the machines and networks they use. It goes back to Lindell and DePerno in the studio repeating that this is the ""biggest crime in American history"". Lindell then gets to ""the moment you've all been waiting for"", where the voice of Mary Fanning, national intelligence researcher and author, on the phone reveals how the cyberattack happened, (breaking through the firewall) and a chart is shown listing ""foreign intrusion/interference"" with identified hackers. The list sees the hacker ID addresses, their targets (states and computers), their methods, their fake credentials and whether they were successful in changing votes, and Fanning says there are thousands of these pages. There is also a video (a Google maps style chart) showing the surveillance system in cyber security, it is a series of coloured moving lines, these are the IP addresses of identified hackers, and the colour specifies how severe the hacks are. The next online video interview is from General Thomas G. McInerney, retired air force and military professional, who gives his perspective on the ""domestic enemy"" threatening the constitution of the United States, and Lindell assures him that there be a revival for the country. Lindell talks via video message to Terry Turchie, former FBI official and political operative, who answers the question of where the FBI were during the ""penetration"" of the country and that a major investigation would be launched about the ""stolen"" election. Finally, Lindell delivers a hopeful message for those watching that America will be returned to ""one nation under God"", and a series of images of a glorious America are shown, and the ending message ""Please share this with everyone you know"". YouTube removed this documentary shortly after the broadcast for violating its policy against election disinformation. In all my life, I have never seen such a stupid factual show with no facts whatsoever! Lindell must be a Trump supporter, and this programme was obviously made with those supporters in mind. It is just a series of images of lists, charts, maps and diagrams with no substantial evidence, and interviews with experts and political figures (more like conspiracy theorists) who often repeat themselves and equally have no substantial proof about what they are talking about. As for Lindell himself, he tries to come across as authentic, he is desperate for viewers to believe the lies that he and the programme are trying to present, no wonder he has got in trouble and lost business. You would have no problem falling asleep during this film, it is all chat with no point that pricks up your ears and attracts your interest, I doubt (or rather hope) even many proper sceptics will get anything out of the nonsense presented. It is programmes like this that give America a bad name and make you question their intelligence and quality of programming. Easily one of the most boring, untruthful, and unwatchable things I've ever seen, a rubbish documentary. It won the Razzie for Worst Picture. Very poor!",True
25,n/a,Imagine,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even suggesting that the 2020 presidential election was stolen through fraud is preposterous. Even suggesting such a thing is a threat to our democracy, and then Russia wins. Everyone knows that Joe Biden is the most popular and competent man who ever lived. This is nothing but tinfoil hat white supremacist conspiracy theories.When they stopped counting the votes and covered over the windows in those swing states it was just for privacy.

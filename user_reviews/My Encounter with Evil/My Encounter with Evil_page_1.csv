1,5,Interesting. Extremely bad annoying production tho.,doriangray-34752,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's interesting to watch and adding real footage is a good thing. Real testimony from the people also helps give credibility. It also brings the opposite opinion by psychologists which is credible too. Unfortunately the production is so bad it's awful to watch. I do not get this recent trend by Netflix documentaries in foreign language with the dubbing into English. Instead of hearing just the English you can hear both languages and most of the time at almost the same volume making it impossible to understand what you're hearing. Also the 3 stories keep moving from one story to the other then back, making it very confusing. Especially when you add how some people are talking about themselves in the past, played by actors, or talking about family members, in the end you have no idea whos speaking and about what and which story is this now and what's happening and it's just confusing and annoying. In the end the only way to watch this is by both being dubbed and subs at the same time. That means you miss many details as you're focused on the subtitles and not seeing what's happening over the corner. Dubbing nowadays is synced automatically making it comfortable to watch as the mouth moves n stops with the words. Nope not here. Since they decided to start the dubbed voice a few seconds after the original. Is this done to give the viewer a sense of discomfort that they might subconsciously attribute to the effect of the stories? Making them feel the story is strong and having such an effect? Whatever the reason I personally dump shows like this after not being able to cope with dumb easily avoided annoyances. I think this will happen with this show too. Unfortunately. I'd recommend trying but be warned that all the problems I mentioned above are multiplied in their bad quality in episode 2. It just keeps getting worse.",False
2,4,Needed better production quality,animosus_liberatio,n/a,16/08/2025,"So the whole series covers the stories of 3 women who have been possessed / touched by evil. A few things irritated me.1. If you do not speak Spanish just click to read the subtitles. The dubbed in English version is horrible because you can hear the native Spanish while trying to hear the translation. I'm fine with subtitles but you cannot look away when you need you constantly need to read the screen.2. Prepared to be confused what story you are watching. They should have just done 3 episodes where each episode highlighted a story but instead mashed all 3 stories into four episodes. Why is this a problem, you may ask? The first story starts with her name on the screen Jesse. Okay cool, this is the person's story. Then boom... we start another story, nothing to transition into the fact that we are now watching person #2's story. They could have put the person's name up like they did on the first story to clue us in that we are talking about the next person. Then again a new story starts just as story 2 was having a peak in the storyline... who are these people talking now? Oh they are telling story 3. Gotcha. In the other episodes they flashed names on the screen to show they were telling a different story when they felt like it.3. After figuring out what story I was finally watching I realized it was because watching the person's whole story from start to finish would have caused the writers to work harder. There's a lot of growling, long jerky possessed scenes, and clips of ""real video"" that became a bore quickly.4. I watched this not knowing what to expect. If it were better organized it would have been better. I was raised Catholic and these stories are bs. If you were possessed, you wouldn't be going around giving detail to detail on your story AND specifically what demon infested you. Those would be things you bury and not talk about otherwise you are just opening another door for them. ""Oh you are talking about me? Cool, I'm heeeeerrrre"" this is just coming from my background. Not my current belief system but whatevsI would have given this a higher rating if the stories transitioned better. I feel that it did the segments an injustice. 1 story an episode would have kept the story nice and clean.",False
3,4,This is important to acknowledge this exists,blightvr-40571,n/a,16/08/2025,"My only complaint is that others do not believe it his, in terms of TV shows why are there people appropriatiny Hispanic voices in this. I cannot stand that it's okay for some other races or ethnic groups to appropriate Hispanic/Latino/Mexican culture. Let's get it right that Mexican are not lations from Latin America or Hispanic whichbsi from Spain. How can everyone be fighting for rights and yet not care about Spanish speakers in the USA. Don't talk to me about fairness for others until someone actually notices and has backed us up. Especially for those who served. I do know believe that it is fair to care only for one enthic group. Let's care for all.",False
4,2,Irritating to listen to,carolbailey-65545,n/a,16/08/2025,"The characters, the storyline, and the acting were pretty good. The dubbing of English over Spanish was horrible. Why would someone even think this is acceptable to customers, or think they could sell it, and people would be happy with it? Both languages were at the same volume. Even with subtitles, it was very hard to understand. It was like listening to 2 people talking at once.I barely got through the 1st episode and turned it off before I got a headache.Netflix needs to do better for 25.00/month, and talking about raising prices. They'll end up losing a lot of customers with this quality of shows/movies.",False
5,1,Doesn't make any sense... CRINGE!,florenciaactis23,n/a,16/08/2025,"I couldn't finish the first episode. Is that bad.The first story is told by The mother of a ""possessed"" girl. She watched how her infant daughter had visions in school, started hurting herself really bad, and the first solution she came up with (after several years) was to put prayers on a sound stereo.... Seriously? Not even one appointment to the doctor to check if your daughter doesn't suffer schizophrenia?? These are all ignorant people, or very smart people trying to sell books.At one point they put ""real videos"" of exorcisms, and you can hear how the possessed person is making animalistic sounds, then you can hear the voice of the priest with the same sound effect haha. This is so cheap and disgusting. Is cringe worthy.I don't recommend this to anybody.",False
6,2,Tiresome and irresponsible pandering...,Quiestar,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMy Encounters With Evil is supposed to be scary. The setup is as follows: three formerly possessed women, in Mexico City, tell their tales of demonic possession (either of themselves or of a parent, sibling, etc. At least one of these subjects is writing a book on the matter, so we cannot be certain of her motivations.Scary? Not in the sense that you witness anything as it happens. These are all stories, with cutaways in which the director and actors, apparently fond of creative and artistic license as they are wont to be; reenact (and overact) these remembered and certainly not embellishes recollections with the unbridled vigor, drama and incongruity of a B-movie. Sure, you might gasp at the one, maybe twi, well-timed jump scares, or be mesmerized by a prop candle designed to continually burn with a bigger and brighter flame (some digital video cameras fare terribly without copious amounts of light). Then there's a dog that barks, as dogs rend to do), and later, his eyes turned monochromatic red. Later, in one of the cutaway re-enactments, one possessed presents herself with eyes that appear to be solid white. We also get the added bonus of a lady walk ing out an a street doing her interpretation of Tourette's syndrome. If spooky monochromatic eye tropes and two curse words repeated twice get ya,' you're in for a treat!The numerous issues with this series seem almost intentional. There's zero evidence of demonic possession, save for those whose motive it is to sell books.Tell me true. If it were a thing, that being demonic possession, and you were suddenly being mentally shredded by no less than one of the most evil Mesopotamian demons... and then got better; would you risk a revisit by flaunting your victory over an 8,000 year-old eternal demon? Remember, he knows where you live. He knows your children, your parents, and those closer to you yet - your pet Labradoodles. I'd venture you'd agree to call it a tie, and never speak of the total mind and body assault (of every kind) for the rest of your natural life.As for the rest if this drudgery of a series, it's filled the anachronisms and numerous critical elements which were never addressed (for good reason, as the ten or fifteen who believe this happened, would feel even more foolish). I'd love to see a more elevated story; one free of tropes, outright nonsense, and without the inclusion of the not quite yet 150 year-old cheesy Ouija Board toy.",True
7,2,Annoying subtitles,Nikki2kk709,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wish Netflix would start doing dubbing over non-English shows. I don't speak any other language. It's very hard to understand what they're saying because they have the cast speaking Spanish but when I tried to put the English subtitles on, you can hear both languages at the same time. I can't focus on what they're saying. I have ADHD too so understanding these subtitles are extremely difficult for me to understand. It's seems like a great show too. I didn't think it would be re-enactments though. Thought it would be only interviews and normal documentary formats. But the acting is bad, it's like they can't figure out what this show should be. Ugh. So many shows I want to enjoy on Netflix but the voices are always so low, music is ALWAYS too loud over voices. But I'm so disappointed because I love these types of documentaries but I can't focus on it so unfortunately I gotta stop because the voice overs sucks.",False
8,10,Terrifying....watch with a Bible in your lap,shouaher-36387,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was literally terrified watching this show. Started this at night and could not stop watching, had to wait until morning to finish. Recommend watching it with a bible in your lap and during the day when the sun is shining bright. The actresses and actors were actually good and scenes were well done, horrific and scary. The thing that got me the most were the ""live"" footage and their sounds...completely haunting. Now I'm afraid to shower by myself or be alone. I highly recommend watching this with a BIble in your lap, or a least a room full of other people. Try not to scream out loud. I will need to say a prayer before doing anything else. This is truly frightening compared to the movies that have been released on the subject.",False

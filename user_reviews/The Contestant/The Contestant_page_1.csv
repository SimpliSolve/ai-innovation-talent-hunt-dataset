1,8,Wtf,xkdsy,n/a,15/08/2025,"The creator of this show is a huge pile of S@&T, He thinks he was being clever and interesting and creating entertaining shows even though he was essentially being a bully torturing another man for profit. I still got the feeling that he thinks he's hot S@&T, and kind of wish that he would've gone to jail. The other creators that are filmed also are responsible for taking part. They have zero sympathy for their fellow man. They are essentially the bully on the schoolyard making money. I hope the contestant himself Has a very fulfilling life now. What a sad story, take advantage of a guy who is Trying to make it.",False
2,8,What the actual hell is going on in Japan,striklix,n/a,15/08/2025,"Bro my god the stuff that happens to this dude is literally horrifying?! I cannot believe that this actually exists and was broadcast to the world and everyone really loved it.. I mean I get that they didn't particularly know how harrowing this situation was for this guy but the fact this man spent a whole fifteen months trapped inside two incredibly small rooms only being able to live off the prizes he won from contests, nearly starving almost all the time and in a constant state of loneliness and depression yet somehow managing to always be entertaining for the camera - whether that be from him possibly going a little stir crazy or just being an immensely funny guy... I think it's a little fifty-fifty there.I really liked the way this was all told, which makes for one of the most visually engaging documentary experiences I have had all year. Edited together really well; between its present day interviews with those involved and related to the people involved plus the actual footage itself from the hit reality show ""Life in Prizes"". Said show stars the central talking point and voice of this documentary, Tomoaki Hamatsu, or better known as Natsubi (meaning eggplant) due to his long face which was the subject of many bullies in his youth but later something he seems to have come to embrace. Natsubi himself is genuinely hilarious, every single joke this man made both on the show itself and during the talking segments were incredibly funny and he has such a strong screen presence that fills the entire atmosphere with joy it's honestly contagious, plus the man has a very happy smile.This documentary showcases some of the most disturbing practices in reality tv I have ever had the chance to witness and I have never before felt so bad for a man who is having psychological warfare being carried out against him. It definitely works amazingly for the show as the entire time you're cheering the man on as you desperately want him to get out, and he does too, but it's immensely depressing to watch this guy break as he gets put through this rigorous process not just once, but two goddamn times. I am just happy that after he had gotten out of doing this show he was able to glean something positive out of it all and the perspective it ended up giving him on the way humans cannot handle loneliness and how helping each other is so important is poetic and beautiful. Also the ending part which is far more recent when he is involved in an avalanche yet instead of trying to make sure he himself is okay after it he immediately rushes to start hello everyone else out is awe inspiring and one of the most moving things I've ever heard of a man doing.Japanese television is apparently really out there which I was not really aware of before.. I mean I have seen some of the wacky game shows that have appeared in tik tok clips but I didn't know they were doing this all the way back then and to such a severe extent that they almost entirely broke this poor man. I really hope it hasn't affected bim so much negatively that it has ruined any portion of his life as he seems like such a happy and funny guy who more than deserves the notoriety that he has acquired, but I do wish it didn't come at the cost of his mental state for a staggering fifteen months. Toshio Tsuchiya is a very interesting guy for being willing and insanely eager to put this man through all of this stuff, and despite him contributing a whole ton of money and resources for a helping cause, and feeling a semblance of remorse for his action - I obviously still don't think what he did was worth it in the slightest and no matter what Natsubi learned from his experience in that situation he never should've been put into it.I very clearly recommend you check out this documentary for yourself if you have Hulu, even if you're not particularly interested in the topic itself I always think it's a good idea to spread some light on a situation I feel like a large portion of people are not already aware of, like me. It's really well told with some fascinating stories from everyone involved and the way it is all put together both looks great but also flows amazingly. It's not a super long runtime either only landing at about ninety minutes so I think it's more than worth giving your time to, and hopefully watching this supports Natsubi in some sort of way. Mans got out through hell and back and somehow came out with an even bigger smile on his face and the urge to help people, so you gotta respect him at the very least. Peak for real.",False
3,7,Please Tell Me Nasubi is Financially Set For Life...,thalassafischer,n/a,15/08/2025,"All I could think while watching this is that in America this kind of TV star never actually gets rich. They might get their foot in the door, or get a lump sum of money they might be able to apply to other endeavors, but you don't necessarily become a millionaire set for life just from being on a TV show - even if people loved that show. That kind of thing really mostly applies to big Hollywood actors. And what this man endured was absolutely traumatic abuse.The absolute gall of that producer calling himself the devil, and saying he didn't know ""at the time"" how far was too far. Really? You were an adult with a career not a twelve year old kid, what do you mean you didn't know at the time how far was too far.Really intriguing to watch, and I am glad Nasubi was able to use his fame to move forward and help people in Fukushima. It may have even given him the tenacity required to survive Mt. Everest if you really think about it...but still.",False
4,n/a,The producer should be in prison,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Crazy documentary. Not in the ""haha"" funny kind of way. More in a ""the producer and pretty much every decision maker involved should be tried in the Hague and imprisoned for a decade"" kind of way... Anything less than them personally paying an above average wage to this man for the rest of his life is grave injustice.This show is what happens when capitalism is not held accountable. It was pure, unbridled exploitation, kidnapping, and psychological trauma for profit. Anyone justifying otherwise is an absolute psychopath. The producer tries to make it seem as though he was conflicted, but he's very obviously a raging narcissist.Nasubi has the heart of a lion. 99% of humanity would not be able to ensure what he went through. I wish him the best.",False
5,7,Not to be Believed,asc85,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is one of those stories that if this came out of the imagination of someone's mind, it would be immediately dismissed as being too fantastical. Instead, this really happened in Japan in the late 90's. Maybe if you're Japanese, you might understand and/or agree with what happened with this show at the time, but since I'm American, it's just stunning to see. I would think that someone has already purchased the rights to make a fictional piece of this event, because if it's done right, everyone's going to want to see it.When watching this documentary, I also thought of Stanley Milgram, and his experiments on how far people will go to obey authority, no matter how bizarre or horrible it is. When Nasubi agreed to repeat this game in Korea, after enduring the game in Japan for nearly a year, my heart really went out to him. The creator said he pounded him for about three hours until he accepted. How is someone - especially in his mental state at that time - going to fight back on that?Thankfully, it seems that Nasubi emerged from this as basically OK. It would have been very easy to have been suicidal or have severe mental problems after undergoing this situation. I wish Nasubi well.",True
6,9,WOW,darrylmsmith,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this by myself and I was saying out loud ""WOW"", ""I don't believe this"", and many expletives.It's a crazy ride. I'm not really an outwardly emotion person, but at certain points, I teared up - out of happiness, out of shock, out of just wrapping my head around.It is much more than a voyeuristic experience of him endure, it really is a reflection of humanity; on one hand the cruelty that humans can afflict on another, and then it also showcases the compassion of humanity.After watching, I am so surprised that here in the US I had never heard about this. It's really unbelievable.I am typing this right after watching and my head is still wrapping my head around what I just saw.",False
7,7,Human exploitation on tv,ievanau,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWow, I wonder how the creator of the show sleeps at night.. For sure a show not meant for Europe or USA, enough to look at the other show that this was a part of, but come on.. human exploitation on tv, for real?? The creator seems very proud of his work, even today, especially when there was no contract and Nusubi didn't get paid at all, however very profitable for the tv show. So much manipulation and humiliation during the first Japan round, then have the guts to traffic a person to South Korea without their knowledge and convice the guy to stay longer.. This is just mind blowing. Money over basic humanity.. Poor Nusubi, mental health problems for life, and for what? I would like to see the creator put in a room, naked, for over a year and eating dog food...
Otherwise the documentary is worth watching once, just mind blowing how this was even allowed.",True
8,9,"Losing faith in humanity, gaining faith in humanity: Nasubi Endures",zackplog,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow.Wow.I'm unable to fully articulate my thoughts. I'm stunned. We see how a collective can excuse, and even laugh at, a person being pushed to the edge. We see what people who have been broken can be capable of. We see humans, standing together, and being stronger together. This fascinating dive into a thought experiment gone too far will, by the end, inspire you to act and live.I suffer from Crohn's Disease and Fibromyalgia. It began back in September of 2001. In my isolation, I learned the deep need for physical connection. How hard it is for an individual to survive alone. From that experience, I can see Nasubi's eyes and find solidarity. But seeing him step into helping others, rather than sinking into a cavern of hating the outside world, he still stepped out.",False
9,6,Decent,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLike a good many documentaries, this gets off to a shaky start, feels solid for the bulk of its runtime, and then flubs its ending. I get what the final 20 minutes was trying to do, but jumping forward more than a decade from the show's conclusion to sudden disaster footage, and then we're climbing Everest? I felt like I fell asleep and missed 10 to 15 minutes or something. And it's always risky to say a documentary should be longer, because so many on Netflix (the worst offender) are way longer than they need to be. But The Contestant is a little off with its pacing.There's also the matter of this not being substantially more informative than some of the YouTube videos out there on the story at times, but having proper interviews with the people involved does help, I'll admit. Otherwise, it's a fairly run-of-the-mill documentary. Thankfully not bloated, but also a bit slight in the end, I think.",True
10,8,Cruel and Unusual Punishment makes for good TV ratings in 1998 Japan,cali-dudefuzi,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe mental torture and brutality inflicted on Nasubi is so over the top, so psychologically horrifying, manipulative, and downright illegal, it leaves you feeling astounded and gobsmacked the entire runtime.How is the Producer not in jail? How is this legal? Questions you'll ask yourself over and over while watching.How did no one think this might be a bad idea now, or even in the long run for someone's state of mind? Even if you never asked yourself that, the answer, ""This is bad."" so clearly slaps you in the face because it's being played out in real time. No editor, producer, or viewer thought: This is bad. He's not ok. ???!!!No food? No utensils to cook with? No clothing? No human contact? No grasp on reality? All you can do is apply to crappy magazine contests? ""WE GOT THE SHOW FOR YOU!""You see him literally starving with his naked, gaunt body on display for everyone. Hungry? Doog food/starvation is fine. Check.Dehumanizing publishing of your diary, sold to millions without your knowledge? With your innermost private thoughts written out (like unaliving yourself) while you endure solitary confinement torture the likes Psychologists/Researchers have never studied because... illegal? Check.Lying to the person about how public his long-form torture will be? Check.Oh he finally won? Move the goalposts, obviously. But first make him think he's being treated to a ""fun trip/prize"" after his torture. Then lead him back into another solitary room, in a country he doesn't know the language and tell him to do it over again? Check.He won, again? Move the goalposts, obviously. Check.Ok, ok, it's been a year & 3 months, let him out. But FIRST, make him think we've locked him up, YET AGAIN-then say ""GOTCHA"" by breakaway walls, in front of a live studio audience he doesn't know watches him, while he's been in solitary confinement for over a year. I'm sure he won't break mentally, or possibly have a heart attack due to his malnourished confinement and subsequent shock of ""reality.""If in the US, that Producer would have been sued into bankruptcy and sent to jail. The fact he didn't have a complete medical mental break, is wild in and of itself.....then later in Nasubi's life, EARTHQUAKES!! (yes PLURAL)... some of the worst the modern world has seen...

11,7,A decent overview,JurijFedorov,n/a,15/08/2025,"It feels a tad pointless in some places. Overall it's a great lesson about the case with English translation for everything. But I have seen this case presented in a way more engaging way on Youtube. With more passion and mystery to it. Here it's all just presented directly. Lazily edited where nothing feels exciting or shocking. We just see stuff happen scene by scene with no great tension or goals. Terrible editing, good material.It's a good intro, but way below the best intros to the case. And with a TV show also coming out the documentary may lack even more behind soon enough. The main event is actually quite shocking. I would also have loved to know more about the best seller books. As he was imprisoned they printed out several of his writings. But who got the money? They never mention much about this smaller stuff. Did he get married? Did he have kids? Does he hang out with friends? Who knows? It's all a tad obscured by lazy editing and lack of narrator telling us everything.",False
12,9,Ying & Yang,JackRJosie,n/a,15/08/2025,"A lot of the reviews here point out the sheer insanity of the nature of the game. Nasubi did endure a level of hell and suffering that many of us will never taste. Japan laughed at him for it. This documentary is grossly tragic. Watching it, my jaw literally dropped to the floor. It does a serious job of depicting the sheer evil in man, the evil in human relationships.This alone would make the contestant a great documentary.What really deals the deal is the last 30 minutes. The switch is flipped and we get a look at what it means to be a good man. We see pure love play out in a broken man's heart. We come to see how to deal with suffering in a healthy and productive way. No. We learn how to deal with suffering in THE ONLY way. Love. The end of this doco had me in tears.People are not mentioning that. But it's what makes this documentary TRULY great. The ying and yang depiction of hate/love good/evil.",False
13,6,bizarre reality TV documentary from Japan,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""The Contestant"" (2023 release from Japan; 90 min) opens, we are introduced to a young Japanese comedian and actor, later nicknamed Nasubi (""Eggplant""), and it is the late 90s. Desperate to get away from Fukushima, he tries his luck in Tokyo, and before we know it, he is entering a wild TV reality show, where he is isolated in a small room and without clothes. He must enter various product sweepstakes to earn food and shelter... At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: as always we need to make a distinction between the subject matter of this film on the on hand, and whether this documentary is any good. As to the former, this borders on psychological bullying, if not worse, and all in the name of attracting higher ratings. Japanese TV has a reputation over pushing the edges, but in my humble opinion, this goes far beyond that. For shame. As to the documentary itself, this is well done, and carefully brought onto the screen. I will admit that I had a hard time watching this. The film makers talk to the main people involved with these events now a quarter century later. The TV producer of this reality show seems to have no, or very little, regrets. As for Nasubi: just watch!""The Contestant"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to great acclaim. It is currently rated 94% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, which feels very generous to me. It is currently streaming on Hulu, where I caught it the other night. If you are in the mood for a documentary about a bizarre reality TV show in Japan from the late 90s, I'd recommend you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
14,5,The producer/creator should have been jailed!,Minniehaha74,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI just watched the contestant and the tortures that that poor man went through for other peoples entertainment is disgusting and sickening! And the man who put this all together and created should be in prison for life! At the end, when that poor man just began to strip because he figured that was his life now without even thinking just made me wanna cry. Shame on you, Japan, for allowing this to happen. And shame on the people who watched this and thought that it was OK for a man to be tortured like this, there are so many other ways that they could've entertained themselves than to watch a man slowly slip into madness and sadness just astound me.",True
15,9,Origin of why we use the eggplant emoji,mr-palmergh,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter feeling like there's a nap on its way from a late night and early morning I put this on thinking it'd be background noise but instead woke me up and made me share this IMDb link to my friends and socials.As a documentary it does everything right except show us how things are currently for Nasubi (which I can do myself but still) and maybe other peoples whereabouts. Despite that the pacing, production value and story is something I don't think I've ever seen. Maybe if it was in the western world more people would know about this man and what he has been through, because it shocked me for a whole 15 months someone was subjugated to this treatment for entertainment and nobody thought to end it?? It's almost as if this was a real life episode of black mirror and the Japanese public just went along with it. Utter rage for the creator who called himself a ""devil"" but glad the ending is as bleak as it could've been.Please watch and go on the emotional rollercoaster I went on, I'm going to find out what happened to those in this movie and now will remember him everytime I see the eggplant emoji being used.",True

Some of the things that happened in there will be amongst the worst nightmare people can imagine.The documentary itself deserves an 8, I would probably not rate the original show that high.",False
18,9,Entertainment vs. Humanity,imeiyou_6775,n/a,15/08/2025,"This story is referred to as a real-life version of ""The Truman Show."" Japanese entertainer Nasubi (meaning eggplant) was selected, due to his ""luck,"" to participate in a prank show. He was confined in a room, required to strip off all his clothes, and forced to live solely by entering magazine sweepstakes through postcards. During this period, he was not allowed to communicate with anyone and had no other food sources apart from minimal life-sustaining supplies. This comedy-oriented reality show documented his life in the small room for a total of one year and three months. The show featured a segment each week updating viewers on Nasubi's latest status. In the end, the show revealed the entire reality show to a bewildered Nasubi, standing naked in the studio hall.This reality show emerged during the golden age of television's influence in 1998, appearing simultaneously in cultural history with ""The Truman Show."" Both reflect an era obsessed with entertainment, showcasing the media's probing at the boundaries of human decency. The show ""Denpa Shonen,"" which birthed this reality segment, can be considered the ancestor of various prank shows in Japan today. To understand how the show operated, one must first understand the entertainers in the Japanese entertainment industry.In the Japanese entertainment industry, entertainers are viewed as the lowest tier. Unlike actors or singers who have specialized skills, these entertainers exist to enrich the entertainment value of shows. They play clown-like roles, needing to rely on antics, humor, and even sacrificing their dignity to gain screen time and recognition.Because of this, entertainers become targets for prank shows. After private agreements between agencies and TV stations, entertainers can be caught off guard and become the targets of these pranks. The camera captures their reactions to the pranks, ensuring the footage is suitable for broadcast. Regardless of the pain, confusion, or anger, entertainers must maintain a sense of being pranked in front of the camera, balancing their emotions to preserve the show's effect. The captured footage is then edited by the TV station, adding subtitles and guest reactions in the studio, diluting the emotions of the pranked individuals and transforming it into humorous segments for viewers.The ""A Life in Prizes"" segment of ""Denpa Shonen,"" aired from 1998 to 1999, can be considered the pioneer of this model. As a reality show, its execution and program effect were astonishing.Firstly, the producers concealed the true nature of the show from Nasubi, promising it would not air on TV to alleviate his doubts. Secondly, they forced him to live without clothes, degrading his dignity to enhance the entertainment effect, such as pixelating his private parts with eggplant shapes. Thirdly, the cruel rule of living off sweepstakes was chosen to increase the show's uncertainty and entertainment value. With no cooking utensils, Nasubi made porridge with drink cartons and, when he ran out of rice, resorted to dog food as his main carbohydrate source. The show even featured scenes of him walking a stuffed toy around the room. Fourthly, they set a prize goal of 1 million yen, extending the show for 11 months, further accumulating the segment's popularity. Fifthly, they condensed 24/7 real-life footage into weekly six-minute episodes, only retaining the entertaining parts while deliberately ignoring the cruelty of his life. Sixthly, they effectively used other media to enhance the show's impact, such as live streaming online and selling Nasubi's diary as a bestseller. Seventhly, they created plot twists; after Nasubi reached the 1 million yen goal, they sent him directly to South Korea for another experiment.In the final scene of the reality show, Nasubi appeared in a small tatami room in the center of the studio. The producer asked him to strip naked again and sit in the middle of the room. Suddenly, the walls collapsed, and he found himself sitting on stage, covering his private parts with a cushion, shocked, as the audience below clapped and cheered. The audience applauded the show's entertainment and humor, completely ignoring the feelings of the protagonist at the center. As viewers, they experienced only the entertainment, overlooking the fact that the individual in the event was a living person capable of feeling pain, just like themselves. Abandoning the recognition and respect for individual dignity, society falls into selective blindness, capable of inflicting the most painful and cruel things on others. Nasubi's shock was a loss of trust in humanity, a shock from peering into the darkest corners of human nature. This scene can be called the most real and darkest moment in television history.However, the story does not end there. From 1999, Nasubi became one of Japan's most famous entertainers. He enjoyed a successful entertainment career, continuing to perform as the Nasubi from ""A Life in Prizes."" Yet, he gradually discovered an unfillable void within himself, increasingly loathing his actions. Until the Great East Japan Earthquake, which caused massive destruction in his hometown, Fukushima Prefecture, he devoted himself to post-disaster relief and the reconstruction of his hometown. From then on, he found his direction and has been dedicated to charitable work in Fukushima Prefecture.Though he gazed into the abyss of human nature, Nasubi did not give up on human society. The experience of ""A Life in Prizes"" made him realize that one cannot live in isolation, unable to maintain normal physical and mental states. Only by transcending personal interests and establishing sincere emotional connections with others can the dark corners of human nature be illuminated, leading to the common good that benefits society as a whole. Nasubi summarized it this way: ""A person can exert more strength when helping others than when working solely for themselves.""",False
19,5,Commentary and collusion,paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Japan has a tradition of television programmes that might be thought of as cruel, but which are presented with a jovial air that, to an outsider, seems wholly baffling. And in the 1990s a man was actually persauded to spend a year naked on camera in solitary confinement. This film revisits those events. The problem is that no-one stands up and says that this was terrible, and that those responsible should have gone to gaol; and for English viewers, the cartoonish labels of the Japenese original are freshly remade preserving the style, so it feels as if the documentary is indulging the tone of the original. The contestant's afterlife is not without interest, but what happened still feels wrong, even after nearly 30 years of subsequent reality television.

We have all kinds of reality shows where people can sign up for extreme deprivation, but they always know that can tap out, and they definitely know that any moment caught on camera might be broadcast.That said, Nasubi is clearly a delightful character and I can understand why people enjoyed watching him.

But yes, this story is very real.I give The Contestant a special mention because the morbid fascination of it all is something special. The story it tells is of a man who agreed to humiliate himself on Japanese television -- in ways that seem downright life-threatening -- but wasn't told that his year of isolation, nudity, and limited sustenance (magazine puzzles earned him clothes and food) would continually be aired live, resulting in a gigantic TV phenomenon. As funny as the movie often is (when it's not unsettling), the inevitable point of it all is that everything you despise -- and that vapid idiots adore -- about reality TV (especially the likes of Big Brother) can pretty much be traced back here.As much as this movie got me thinking about the absolute state of reality television, the film itself doesn't delve into these ideas as much as I should like, but this is still a highly recommended viewing and my favorite documentary feature of 2024.",False

THIS GUY AGREED AND CHOSE THIS, THE ROOM WAS NOT LOCKED.So stop blaming producers, people in TV business/staff and so on. This guy got his dream/s come true as an actor and comedian, he literally worked his naked a$$ off. He knew he could leave at any time but he didn't. And yall here ""omg they made him do this and that"", NO THEY DID NOT.Plot twist.The only part of mental gymnastics was convincing him the contestant for Korea show. It took 3 hours, sadly wasn't shown or told what exactly they were talking about. Because there's literally no prize/end goal for the winner. Also now that I wrote that it doesn't make sense because the contestant already knew the footage wouldn't be aired on TV.So maybe we are the duped ones because he knew everything?... Who knows, right? Think logically, why would he agree to participate in survival mode to gain nothing afterwards? You don't just agree to random things when a stranger asks you.",True

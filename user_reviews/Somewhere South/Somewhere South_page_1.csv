1,10,Amazing cultural and food series,barrymn1,n/a,16/08/2025,"While watching this amazing series, one learns more about diverse Southern food and culture than any TV program I've ever seen. Vivian and her team produced the most satisfying look into the culture, history and food of probably the least understood portion of the USA.",False
2,10,She always takes us somewhere new,mydukedocs,n/a,16/08/2025,"She takes us to places we have been to and helps us see these places in a new way. I had no idea about the Jewish history in Texas, the Asian history of Mississippi, or the diversity of Clarkston. Planning my road trips around her stories.",False
3,n/a,Enjoyable watch for us foodies.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This six part PBS series is available on DVD, two discs each with three episodes that run about 52 minutes each. So that adds up to a bit over 5 hours of programming.Each of the six episodes covers a different topic, traveling to restaurants and festivals to see how people approach things in different parts of the South, from North Carolina to Tennessee, to Texas, to Florida.It is very well done and Vivian Howard has a winning personality. My own three favorite episodes are the ones on Barbecue, Hand Pies, and Dumplings.Good series, entertaining and informative. I found the DVD set at my public library.",False
4,4,Not just food and culture. Prepare to be bashed -hard- over the head with politics.,moviemom23,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was happy to find a new good food program. I am not really familiar with food from the American south, so this looked interesting.Only got as far as the second episode. So far Latinos are afraid to gather in the south, and the entire US economy is based on rape and pillage. I can only go so far. This chef bends over backwards to pile on racial guilt every chance she gets. Most Americans are good and generous no matter their color or ethnic background. I don't get the feeling this chef believes that and its depressing to watch.The direction of this program is extremely offensive. Every comment is loaded. So now even a show about food (!!!) tries to separate Americans into neat little piles of black, brown, and white. Best, better, bad. Yes we CAN and should celebrate American culture without bashing an entire population of people to do so.",False

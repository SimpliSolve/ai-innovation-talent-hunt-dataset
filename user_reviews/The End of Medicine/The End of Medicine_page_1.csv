1,10,Straight from the mouths of witnesses!,xnqncpvn,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is truly frightening! But we can do something about it! This film highlights the causes of pandemics, the risks and the outcomes. Testimonials from vets, farmers and scientists. If you care about the future, for your kids, grandkids, for YOU, then please watch this. The film highlights the dangers of animal farming, the way animals are treated and slaughtered and how easy infection can spread to humans. Farmers will say they don't use antibiotics but the vet proves they do. Just because you eat organic, grass fed, free range meat this doesn't mean that you are immune! All animals end up at the slaughter house where processes can spread disease.",False
2,9,Pretty eye opening stuff,clare-i-kelly,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerI had heard of most of the issues they raise in this documentary and it shines a light on how the west does love to blame pretty much anyone else for its problems... The behaviour of the RSVS was enlightening. Reminiscent of the gun or tobacco lobby intimidating whistleblowers but over here in the UK. Scary stuff for a young vet to deal with.The points raised about environmental racism also feel very raw and are pretty heartbreaking.It barely felt like an hour and was very engaging so definitely worth a watch if you're at all interested in how to prevent the apocalypse... Something really needs to change. Lots of things in fact.,True

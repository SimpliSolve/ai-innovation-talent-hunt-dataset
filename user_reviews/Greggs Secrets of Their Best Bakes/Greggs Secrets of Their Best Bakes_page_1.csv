1,4,Interesting aspects but basically one long advert,mrowickham,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh my goodness! Firstly I would say that it appears some people hold Greggs much closer to their hearts than I do. I experienced this when working in Manchester and was surprised just how much the mediocre food was liked. On this basis it just possible that the presenter was earnest in her OTT Greggs fanaticism, but it is really overbearing. She seems amazed at how Greggs make doughnuts, bypassing the fact that many companies manage to assemble the rocket scientists required to make doughnuts at scale.There also is no mention of how the popularity of the food mainly because it is super cheap and the trade-offs that are made in terms of ingredient quality.There are a few interesting bits about the technology of puff pastry and process which does redeem the documentary and gets four stars.",False
2,1,Just terrible Is it April fools,lordbrianturbo,n/a,16/08/2025,It's almost like Grace Dent literally has no idea what is in a sausage roll and that you need to bake them. She was amazed that they all go in the oven for a set time. Also seemed so excited about baking one herself. You can buy them from Iceland frozen. She seems just marvelled at how quite basic food is made. This was so bad it's just really bad. Someone should tell her you can buy frozen ones already and bake them at home. That might be full sensory overload though. Can't quite believe what I just watched. It was like a small child discovering how to boil an egg. Though I'd imagine most 5 year olds could tell her what a sausage roll is and they probably are cooked in an oven.,False
3,1,Worst docu ever,sam-25824,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is filmed as though Grace is auditioning for a role in Sex and the city. The outfits, make up and hair combined with the random camera shots of her feet.Does anyone already not understand how Greggs works?? Large parts of the show are dedicated to reverse engineering products. They obviously believe Greggs is beneath them. Let's be honest the chefs are using top notch ingrewhen the reality is it will be packed with palm oil and emulsions
The continuous background music is annoying.This is so boring it really offers nothing new, I can't believe Netflix are promoting a naff channel 5 show as new content.She just uses questions as statements that is annoying. The positives are its put me off Greggs.",False
4,2,An answer to a question no one wanted answered,ross-letham,n/a,16/08/2025,"An answer to a question no one wanted answered, no not what's in a Greg's, but can Grace Dent present? The answer is a hard no! Unfortunately this manages to accomplish the trifactor of being thoroughly uninteresting, terribly presented and a one sided endorsement of all things Greg's. Let's not worry about talking about nutrition and Greg's contribution to the ongoing childhood obesity crisis, no no no this is a Greg's Puff (pastry) piece au paired by a food snob who clearly has not been in a Greg's for 30 years. I strongly advise any restaurant that Grace Dent dares to review in future to simply run down to your local blue bakers and pick up a pasty, if this series is anything to go by she will have a foodgasam and 5 star reviews will insue.",False
5,2,Appalling - Basically a Promo for Greggs,morgrp-556-453854,n/a,16/08/2025,"Advertised as a hard hitting documentary. Reality is it's a thinly veiled, pointless promo for Greggs, that involves a ""food critic"" telling us how fabulous and tasty a cheapo sausage roll costing a quid is. Grace Dent presents as an instagram wanna be and convinces no one that a bland chicken in white sauce bake is the best thing she's ever tasted.Essentially a means of advertising junk food by getting around the advertising laws by portraying this drivel as a factual documentary. If it was fact, she'd report that essentially Greggs products are full of garbage. No one cares they are and everyone knows. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to grab a steak bake....",False
6,10,Grace dent,Dogloverxxxxxlll,n/a,16/08/2025,Loved this documentary so interesting and gave great insight into greggs and how it worked. I used to work in greggs and didn't really understand the full process of how it worked but this gave me a full understanding of sausage rolls and doughnuts. Massive fan of the new vegan sausage rolls too they are so tasty. Particularly interesting given how much I love greggs !!! Love grace too she was so good in it and doesn't deserve the hate that I've seen in the earlier reviews. So this review is dedicated to grace I love you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So much !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,False

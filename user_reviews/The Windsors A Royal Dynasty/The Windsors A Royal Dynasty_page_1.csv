1,6,Extremely biased,M15xie,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very quick run through of the Windsor family beginning with king Edward's abdication.Firstly this was extremely rushed and obviously biased to portray the royal family in a brighter light than they deserve. They portray Dodi as a drug addict, and don't even mention how he was also killed in the accident or share any condolences. They talked about it for 5 mins then moved on to Margaret and the mother dying. I believe they rushed through all the history just to be able to talk about harry and Meagan which really isn't that interesting. This started very well but was obviously produced by royalty sycophants (literally had the relatives of multiple family members speaking) and I wish they had kept a more objective tone throughout the series.",False
2,10,Fascinating look into the British Royal Monarchy,jdubya-62161,n/a,16/08/2025,"Growing up American, I have always been interested in the Royal family. Their history stretches back for nearly a thousand years! I believe this documentary will be insightful even if you have followed this family for years.This is an honest look into the complex lives of the Royal family. It shows that they are human, after all. We celebrate the pomp and pageantry, the weddings, births, and mourn the tragedies, as we do in all our lives but theirs is on a much grander scale AND with the whole world watching.The Queen of England did an extraordinary job of trying to control the uncontrollable; people. She had to learn, adapt and overcome so much. She handled it all for 70 years with grace and dignity. She was a shiny light we all followed.I hope the monarchy continues. I dont think this family will suddenly become boring. What would the world look like without the British Royal Family? I think it would be a darker place indeed.",False

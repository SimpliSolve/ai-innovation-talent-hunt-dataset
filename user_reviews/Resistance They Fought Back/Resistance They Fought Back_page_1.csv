1,10,Touching and inspiring.,mikesouza-5250,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found this documentary of the Jewish resistance during WWII to be incredibly well presented and transformative. The direction and storytelling is quite exceptional. Everyone should watch this, not only to learn about the atrocities the prisoners of the ghettos and concentration camps were forced to endure, but to experience the inspiration of those who resisted and fought their oppressors. What is most moving about this film is that much of the narration and the story being told is taken directly from the journals and writings of the people who were brave enough to stand up and fight for their freedom. A truly inspiring story.",False
2,10,My spirit soared,fritziross,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very moving & inspiring stories from the Holocaust. Most of them I knew & needed to be reminded of, because now that fascists run the ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡², we might yet face that here.I didn't know that many Jews risked their lives to smuggle books into the Vilna Ghetto to create its library, & I'm unsure if I ever knew that Jewish prisoners, the Sonderkommando, at Auschwitz exploded & burned down a gas chamber and a crematorium.I knew all about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, but it was great to hear that they held Nazis at bay for longer than nations of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.There was something about hearing about the planning: when asked if she'd help smuggle gunpowder, one heroine at Auschwitz ""didn't hesitate"". That kind of raw courage blew me away.I had to write a review after I read the unfair bad one: I fight for justice for Palestinians & an end to Israeli war crimes, but that's no reason to dislike Jews in the Holocaust getting their due, unless one's anti-Semitic.I didn't erase it from my DVR after I watched it; I'll need to see it again.",False
3,1,Resist it,DrD3,n/a,15/08/2025,"The style of the documentary and presentation shows that this presentation was well funded. But I have to say that I struggled to find any merit in this presentation as it tended to alter preconceived events from the past; especially those being interviewed, as it seemed either professionally scripted or personally staged. Hence; this documentary turned out to be mainly a rewrite of history that is based on wishful thinking rather than actual historical fact. Also, it is a rather peculiar documentary to be released these days given the present day conflict with those in question. One group gets praised while the other gets vilified for their ""resistance"".",False

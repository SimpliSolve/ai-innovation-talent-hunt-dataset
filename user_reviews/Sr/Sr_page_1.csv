1,7,Elegy for Sr.,jgreco7,n/a,16/08/2025,"Robert Downey Jr.'s documentary ""Sr.,"" a tribute to his dying father, filmmaker Robert Downey Sr., is the stuff dreams are made on, a freestyle, loopy narrative, much like that of his father's films, that doesn't so much as unfold as unravel. However, there is a thread that holds this narrative together: the chronology of Downey's short career, beginning with ""Chafed Elbows"" in 1966 to ""Putney Swope"" in 1969, the film for which he is best remembered (accepted to the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress--an argument can be made for ""Greaser's Palace"" from 1972, a worthy film, fully realized, and borderline coherent). There are highlights from ""Pound"" in 1970 (Downey Jr.'s acting debut) to ""Hugo Pool"" in 1997 (with Jr again, who has now become a rising, mainstream actor). Movie clips are fun to see and serve a purpose, but are presented without insights into Downey's unique vision and style that would have been helpful to those unfamiliar with his oeuvre. Sadly, Sr.'s career in the 90s took a wrong turn on the Hollywood freeway, where his quirky genius and undisciplined creativity were tampered down by studio moguls (""Hugo Pool"" is perhaps the best of the later films). If there is anything to be learned from Sr.'s output of irreverent, undefinable, sometimes incomprehensible movies is that they are a pervasive call to action, so beautifully lampooned in ""Putney Swope,"" which is to raise an indignant finger at the established order. In another time, Sr would have been the Paul Thomas Anderson of his age, making undefinable, irreverent, sometimes incomprehensible movies, but with wider acceptance and better production values.Downey's loving portrait, his efforts to memorialize his father's career, from his youth to his deathbed (not a figure of speech), and document the final three years of his life, is at times touching and embarrassing to watch. I understand his motives in making this film: he has, after all, earned the wider, public appeal and financial rewards that Sr could not, whose fame far surpassed that of Sr., only to be labeled ""Robert Downey's father."" But I question this fashionable compulsion nowadays to broadcast the intimate, private moments of one's life, those moments clearly not intended for mass consumption. Sr always lacked discretion in his material, so this compulsion somehow seems appropriate, but disturbing, too. There is also something incongruous at work here, in that the phenomenally successful actor, with homes in Hollywood and the Hamptons, mostly films his iconoclastic father inside his modest New York apartment, an irony which I doubt was lost on Sr. (although maybe lost on Jr.). For the record, Jr was at one time the most promising actor of his generation, one of the best in fact (just watch his brilliant performance in ""Chaplin""), but who in the end squandered his gifts for the profitable, movie franchise business. He is not, however, alone on that well-worn path, traversed by others of his age, Cage, Depp, Reeves, and Cruise. To his credit, he overcame addictions and revived a floundering career, yet it remains to be seen whether he will fulfill his former promise in more challenging, meaningful work. This documentary may be a step in that direction, as it returns him to his father's drive and purpose in the movie-making business. It may as well return audiences to the first Downey, especially Jr.'s Sherlock fans, turning them onto his modest, experimental, joyful, confounding movies. I for one want to watch ""Putney Swope"" and ""Greaser's Palace"" again.",False
2,8,A touching tribute between generations,tobysands89,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWatching this had me laughing, crying and wanting to watch more films. Not knowing of Downy Sr work as a director it shows some interesting films he has made in his career and wanting to find and watch them.The humour between father and son had me in stitches at times. And as far as crying goes if you have any experience with Parkinson's you will know what it is like watching a family member suffer and slowly disappear in front of you over a number of years.The added touch of being mostly in black and white (other than film & chat show clips) gives the film a feeling that it's capturing memory of someone who is no longer alive.",True
3,8,"""Sr."" offers a unique and personal look at the life and work of Robert Downey Sr.",FilmFanatic2023,n/a,16/08/2025,"In ""Sr."", Robert Downey Jr. And Chris Smith present a unique and personal approach to a bio-doc about Robert Downey Sr., the filmmaker and father of the famous actor. Shot in black-and-white, the film captures the intimacy and complexity of their relationship, as well as Downey Sr.'s artistic process. The inclusion of alternate versions of certain scenes and discussions about the framing of others adds to the documentary's focus on the art of filmmaking. Despite some potential areas for deeper exploration, the emotional access given to Smith by the subjects and the power of finality as Downey Sr. Faces his own death make for a moving and thought-provoking viewing experience.",False
4,7,VIEWS ON FILM review of Sr.,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA lot of people know who Robert Downey Jr is. Okay the whole world knows who he is. Bob is a movie star from those Marvel endeavors. The dude once commanded $75 million for one flick (remember Avengers: Endgame?).Sr (my latest review) is not about Robert Downey Jr. I mean it kind of is but that's a moot point. It's mainly about his father Robert Downey Sr. Sr is a guy who was not as much in the limelight, making low budget, independent films and appearing as an actor in stuff like Boogie Nights and/or To Live and Die in L. A.I've never seen a Robert Downey Sr-directed pic but Sr provides plenty of archive footage from his stuff via the late 60s and early 70s. Said archive footage counteracts with recent interviews that counteract with random scenes that are sort of playful cuts of the late subject (Sr of course). It's like a movie within a movie within a documentary, shot in black & white while harboring a somber and evocative tone.Sr is a docu that is told chronologically but feels non-linear at the same time. It's not perfect but there's a certain earthiness to it. I mean it feels more personal that most (of any type). You see Robert Downey Jr in a way you've never seen him before (it's like he's a regular Joe). You also get to know his dad and what an out of the box filmmaker he was, all satiric and radical and whatnot. I've always thought of their relationship as opposite sides of the pickle. Jr is well, blockbuster and his pops sort of a hidden, Woody Allen type.What's heartbreaking is that Sr ends up following the last years of Robert Downey Sr's life. It was filmed over a period of three showing the gradual decline of Sr's health due to Parkinson's disease. Thankfully through Sr we get to know this man and his visionary turns that stayed under the radar to most Hollywood annals. Senior day!",True
5,10,Portrait Of The Artist As A Dying Parent 401: Master Class,ObviTheMargs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Time is finite, archives are what one makes of them, and child parent relationships vary by example. The Downeys exemplify this. And kudos to Jr for making ""Sr,"" because it is a gem.The forest view that RDJ provides of his father in his twilight years is as much a love language and path to understanding as it is a finessed effort to balance and setting the bar of creativity and life's imperfections for his own children.Plus it's in black & white. Mostly. The self-aware choice of b & w elevates the subject imo, and truly provides a greater measure of reverence and artistry.This documentary is the best example of following your art, following your heart, and never stop pursuing the next opportunity. Film, family, self-reflection.",False
6,7,A Profoundly Engaging Documentary,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"How does one sum up the life of a loved one in a few hours of film? That can be especially challenging when it involves someone who lived a full life, one that distinguished the individual in question as an artist, an innovator, a rebel, and, perhaps most of all, a loving soul. That's the task that actor-director Robert Downey Jr. Undertook when creating this cinematic tribute to his father, Robert Sr., in the waning months of his life. In doing so, the junior Downey has compiled a documentary that examines the irreverent, unconventional underground filmography of his dad, including a wealth of clips from cult classics like ""Putney Swope"" (1969), ""Pound"" (1970), ""Greaser's Palace"" (1972) and ""Two Tons of Turquoise to Taos Tonight"" (1975), as well as footage from a project the elder filmmaker was working on during the compilation of this production. In addition, the film features interviews with some of Senior's colleagues, such as Norman Lear, Alan Arkin and character actor Larry Wilson, along with those whose work he significantly influenced, like director Paul Thomas Anderson. But, more than that, the film also chronicles the life of Downey Sr. The man, particularly his loving relationship with his successful yet often-troubled son and his personal battle with Parkinson's Disease. The inclusion of this material thus gives the picture a quality of universality as it seeks to address the big questions of life that we should all strive to understand as we come to the ends of our lives, issues deftly handled here with profound sensitivity and heartfelt feeling. For all these strengths, though, there are a number of sequences that feel like unfocused filler, especially early on when the film strives to find its footing and establish the tone it's attempting to set for what follows. Once that's accomplished, however, this offering flourishes, growing ever more captivating the further one gets into it. Indeed, there's certainly more going on here than a mere laundry list career recitation, presenting a portrait of an individual - and a relationship - that's far more personal than what most viewers would likely expect from fare like this. Give this one time to develop, and you're sure to find it engaging, touching and heartwarming.",False
7,9,A Poingent Letter From Son to Father,mcal1973,n/a,16/08/2025,"I came across this by accident, and am SO glad I did. An absolutely honest, touching and truly raw look at an unconventional father/son dynamic. A father and son, who, despite their seemingly dysfunctional and unhealthy relationship, possess a wholly unconditional love, affection and mutual respect for each other. A truly beautiful and touching love letter from a son to his father, ""hero"". Thank you so much for reminding us that our connections are what are truly important at the end of the day. I love how much Jr loves Sr. I have ALWAYS been a Jr fan, and this film has welcomed me into an honest relationship, with all of its ugliness.",False
8,6,Sr,henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary charting the contribution of maverick independent film maker Robert Downey Sr and his relationship with his son as he nears the end of his life.An odd mix this, as whilst it is all a bit wacky and rather 'Hollywood' about a film maker who, as someone points out, was never particularly troubled whether his films made sense, it is very touching. The intimate relationship between father and son is indeed very sweet and does get to you, particularly towards the inevitable end. I can't say I get an urge to go back and watch any of Sr's avant garde contributions to the 60s and 70s, but he did seem like a nice man with ambition and drive.",False
9,9,What a living tribute...,dsb-02142,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know much about Robert Downey Sr. As I didn't follow his work. But I have watched Robert Downey Jr since he was a teenager. With all of the trouble that he ended up going through, I think it's amazing that he and his father retained a wonderfully close relationship. This is a loving, caring tribute from father to son and son to father. I love that Cat Stevens music was used in the movie. It was wonderful to see Jr's son involved , especially toward the end of Sr's life. I do t know what I expected, but I really enjoyed this amazing documentary. Thank you for sharing your personal life love and sadness with us.",False
10,7,To Father to father to son!!,li0904426,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie ""Sir."" is a documentary by Robert Downey Jr. Capturing the last years of his father's life, showcasing their relationship and Downey Sr.'s battle with Parkinson's disease. It's a love story that spans three generations, marked by loss and grief. The documentary skillfully encapsulates the bond and passion that the Downey family shares for the art of filmmaking. Through a montage of Robert Downey Sr.'s old films, we gain insight into the mind of an unconventional director and a visionary ahead of his time.Simultaneously, we observe the contrast between the father, who did not conform to the restrictive and profitable Hollywood model, and his son, Robert Downey Jr., who emerged as one of the most profitable actors in Hollywood.The movie carries a profound emotional resonance, as it's clear that Downey Jr. Created the documentary with the intent to delight, pay tribute to, and familiarize his father with his own children. In this context, the documentary is a lyrical poem that doesn't adhere to the traditional structure of having a beginning, middle, and end, but rather, it represents an ongoing cycle in the life of the Downey family.",False

12,5,Contemplating Demonstrating,TheFearmakers,n/a,16/08/2025,"The life and times and work of maverick low budget movie director Robert Downey Sr would have been interesting without having to be so bound to his far more famous son, actor Robert Downey Jr., hence the title SR because this is supposedly all about dad instead of son...But there's just not enough of the titular auteur and too much of the superstar offspring playing with his kids (Sr's grandkids) and saying Jesus Christ or Jesus H Christ in every way possible... it's like playing Scrabble with Billy Graham...It's nice that Jr wanted to showcase his cult movie-making dad for his own more mainstream Marvel fans... a kind of, ""while I am a Hollywood kid, I was a COOL Hollywood kid...""Yet you really don't get to know either Downey as they're both so breezy, offbeat, offhand and affably smug to showcase anything inside them to make this kind of anti-documentary (by American Movie director Chris Smith) really work...The bottom-line is, SR needed a more sturdy and legit documentary-style experience into his own merits beyond playtime with famous son, and the way they mishmash the two styles... director bio and famous relatives hanging out... doesn't always work -- at least not like it should...Because instead of celebrating SR as a filmmaker, it seems the only really effective thing he ever did was... to have a baby named JR.",False
13,10,Forever a Downey Fan,scruz71895,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember like it was yesterday the day that I discovered Robert Downey Jr. On film. I was only 15 years old when I saw Iron Man 2. I remember I turned to my friend and said, ""who is that?"" She knew who he was and had already been a fan of his. Since that day, I became an aficionado when it came to his films. I found his backstory to be very interesting and how although he had endured a lot of hardship he came back with a vengeance and turned out to be the highest paid actor and our beloved Tony Stark/Iron man. This film binds together the love of him and and his father. It's a must watch! :)",False

15,10,Lovely documentary about someone I knew nothing about.,ourelbi,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'd never seen any of Sr's films, nor knew anything about him. But this documentary was done with such love and pride about his work, it has me now searching for them, as well as some of the music on them (Charley Cuva, for one). I loved watching and listening to him - his smile and eyes as an older man, lit up the screen and he always sounded so positive and friendly - it made me wish I'd known him. He seemed like a really lovely man - someone you'd want to see and talk with every day. I couldn't help but compare his looks with Michael Caine (but that might just be me). I think they did a lovely job - and I love the black and white too.",False

I have to admit never seeing any of the movies featured but can identify many of the cast as movers and shakers in the industry. Testament to a man who made movies for the pure pleasure of movie making and challenging the perceptions of others. Family and friends contributing to a precis of a craftsman and a Son charting his final farewell to a Man who allowed him live his own life.Many time I recognised parallels in the relationship between Father and Son and my own parent & myself (sudden death syndrome) and that last 'interview' where Jr 'knows' is touching as it is shared with Jr's Jr. I can only conclude that when Sr's mind went elsewhere it was back to the time when editing of his segment was in process.At times poignant, mostly humorous, this end-time journey was something I would not usually watch but I am so glad I did, such creativity.",False

I love the weirdness and everything with Robert Downey Jr! Such a great film even with 3 hours sleep I'm shocked it wasn't part of the best documentary's in the Oscar's. Great how Sir Robert was trying to direct even though he was the star, such a magnificent finale of his career sad he died from Parkinson's disease almost 2 years ago.

18,9,A Very Different Side of Robert Downey Jr,DavoZed,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are looking for some kind of lightweight, Entertainment Tonight type profile of Downey, this isn't your film.This is a warts and all documentary about Downey's life, the life of his filmmaker father and their relationship. It's quite informal and filled with all kinds of retakes, discussion of camera angles etc. They are both working on a film, during the course of this film.Downey comes across as very down to earth, happy and kind. His father who is in his eighties, is similarly nice. They seem to have a remarkable relationship and appear to be each other's best friends.I came away with a completely different opinion of Downey. My previous opinion of him was a function of some of the roles that he has had plus his struggles with drugs. In reality he is nothing like I thought he would be. He is a dramatically better human being.A thoroughly enjoyable film but probably a little informal and unfocused for some people. NOT a Hollywood film.",False

Obviously it focuses on Robert Downey Jr. And Robert Downey Sr., but it is a film to be reflected on by any man raising a son. It is an intimate look into the complex relationship that exists between the men who grow, and the men who raised them. A lens between the past, present, and potential future. Lastly, there needs to be a deep deep respect and ultimate admiration to RDJ to allow the outside world to look at him and his father's relationship while his father is fading into the twilight of his years.

23,8,ONE LAST GOODBYE...!,masonfisk,n/a,16/08/2025,"A 2022 Netflix documentary detailing the sweet final weeks between actor Robert Downey Jr. & his iconoclastic writer/director father Robert Downey Sr. Culling copious film footage from his career, especially his anti-establishment calling card Putney Swope, Downey excelled at making films on his own terms w/the possibility of gaining a lucrative payday an accidental plus. Through a series of conversations between the two, sometimes over Skype & such (due to COVID restrictions), the father/son try to get to the heart of senior's style which sometimes bled over into his personal life (as his wife, young Robert & his sister were corralled into his productions) but as senior's physical deterioration (due to his battle w/Parkinson's disease) slows his movements & excursions to a crawl, the family makes their goodbyes & acknowledge the mistakes senior made along the way. Having only seen Swope just recently I can't assess senior's body of work but his working method clearly poured over to junior's fearless acting style (his Oscar nominated performance in 2008's Tropic Thunder, in black face no less, is said to have been a tribute to senior's dubbing over the black lead in Swope) probably did senior proud.",False

25,10,"We're here, we do stuff, and we're gone.",lepetitberger,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI didn't expect to love this as much as I did. I didn't expect to find so much beauty and inspiration and genuine love-- not only for artistry itself, but also the love that can be shared between father and son, and son again. Turning on the documentary to discover Sr. Was a true joy, one that had me smiling to myself throughout. The way he speaks, how he interacts with others, the way he almost refuses to engage in any truly seemingly ""coherent"" manner, always diverting expectations and seeking the ultimate form of humour... I find myself yearning for more. I find myself admiring that tenacious ability to say so much whilst doggedly refusing to fall onto the predetermined, the expected, or the known.And, of course, I fell in creative love with a brand new muse the instant I cracked up so hard I had to pause not even 5 minutes into the doc: ""F you, and f the establishment! And f you people who are trying to make me part of the unestablished establishment!"" (Said by a kid no older than 13. Unrelated to that scene, but agreed with Sr on the military school for children-- it only made sense if they were 10!)And, oh! I just didn't know how much better it was going to get! Every single glimpse of Sr's work, unknown to me until that very moment, made me more and more eager to watch these movies. And, though I have yet to follow through with that desire (right after this review is published!), I can't help but find the similarity between Sr's style (as described in the doc), and what Jr crafted with this documentary. The end statement by Jr is the heart of it: ""We're here, we do stuff, and we're gone."" -- and I love it. I love that the doc isn't trying to be anything that it is not. I love that it flowed, and keened, and sang. And I truly, from the depths of my heart, loved every instant we got to see of Sr laughing at something that happened on screen. The way he enjoyed film... The way he asked the editor to repeat the funny little scene with Jr in it... ""I'm just being happy."" Yes. We can tell, and we're glad we got to see it.I hope this world can have more love, more creativity and more people like Sr and Jr both. Regardless of whatever mistakes might have been committed along the way, ultimately it is love for one another and love for the craft that persists above all else.And last but not least...For me, what elevated this documentary from a 9 to a definite 10 was the scene from Grease's Palace after the credits. The magician engages in the classic ""I will pull out your card from this deck"" trick. Instead, he pulls one card after another, shoving it in the other character's face, and asks: ""Is it this one?"" but, inevitably, none of them are. As a viewer, I was smiling immediately, and instantly fell in love with that game that Sr draws you into--- how long will he dare take it for? Somehow, the sweet spot seems to always be right after the sweet spot--- right after it feels it should stop... that's when it becomes the most eloquent. What a masterpiece, and what a beautiful metaphor to end it on.Is it this one? Is it that one? It's not, none of them are, but we'll pull all out of the deck and have a look at each one... and then we'll be gone.",True

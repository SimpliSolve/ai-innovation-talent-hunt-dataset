1,9,Fade To Black...,DJM26,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just as 'The Sopranos' was a masterful combination of writing, directing and acting, so too is this documentary. I thought it would be good, but I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.Setting it in Melfi's old office set was a master stroke. The audition clips were fantastic; especially watching other actors read the lines that would become so iconic and so identified with the actors who eventually played those characters.We got some real behind-the-scenes insight into the enigmatic James Gandolfini. When the director, Alex Gibney asked David Chase, upon hearing that Gandolfini had died (at age 51), were you surprised? Chase's one-word response was chilling: No.My biggest complaint was that there was very little of Junior, and absolutely no Dominic Chianese. I would have also liked to have seen Steve Schirripa, John Ventimiglia, Vince Curatola, Federico Castelluccio, Max Casella, Joe Pantoliano, Steve Buscemi, Ray Abbruzzo, David Proval, Aida Turturro and Sharon Angela. Also, a brief 'In Memorium' of all the actors who have passed.And then the ending...!!",False
2,8,Remember when,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Being the creative force behind what many consider to be the best TV show of all time - one that changed the face of television - is both a blessing and a burden. David Chase is that man, and his often dour disposition hides the creative genius behind ""The Sopranos"" (1999-2007). Oscar winning documentarian Alex Gibney (TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE, 2007; ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM, 2005) re-creates Dr. Melphi's office for his sit down with Chase, and it's a smooth move to encourage Chase to open up in the same setting where his creation, Tony Soprano, often let his guard down. This is not really meant as an introduction to garner new fans for reruns, but rather as a tribute to David Chase and a peek behind the curtain for hardcore fans.Don't worry ... it's not three hours of two guys talking. Gibney complements Chase's insight with a treasure trove of clips and interviews and background details, really serving up a deep dive for those who considered this show to be must-see TV. Chase actually quotes one of the best lines from the series when he says, ""'Remember when' is the lowest form of conversation"". By the end of the first (of two) part, many will be amazed at just how much of the show was inspired by David Chase's actual life and large Italian family. You might also be amazed at how fragile the environment can be for even the most successful of TV shows.Chase lets us in on some personal details, and nothing is more personal than his proclamation, ""My mother was nuts."" Fans will eat up the segment on Nancy Marchand, the veteran actor who played Livia, Tony's mother. Chase said Ms. Marchand just ""had it"" (what he wanted for the character based on his own mother). It's also interesting to learn that Chase's early career aspirations were for movies, not television. In fact, he envisioned this as a movie starring Robert DeNiro and Anne Bancroft. Of course, no one would back him, and when he converted it to a series, none of the networks had an interest either. It took upstart HBO, who at the time was only beginning the transition from Movies and Sports to series. The reception of ""Oz"" (1997) and ""Sex and the City"" (1998) set the table for HBO to give the green light to the risky venture that itself eventually set the table for shows such as ""Breaking Bad"".The conversation between Gibney and Chase is interspliced with clips from the show, as well as family video and pictures. Chase walks us through how the main characters were cast, and it's fascinating to watch the rough cuts of auditions - some who made it, and some who didn't (including former Cornell star RB and ""Hill Street Blues"" actor Ed Marinaro). This gives us a true behind-the-scenes glimpse at how things came together. We also hear from some of the show's writers who explain just how stressful things could get in the writers' room, even though HBO gave them significant creative control.There are segments featuring Michael Imperioli, Steve VanZandt, Lorraine Bracco, Tony Sirico, and Drea de Matteo. Perhaps the most enjoyable is watching Edie Falco (who was the last one cast in the principal cast) as she explains there were no ""trigger warnings"" for the show. She states it was just like real life, complete with racism, sexism, misogyny, and violence. It's hilarious hearing how sensitive Sirico was about his hair, and Drea walks us through her character's ending - just after Lorraine Bracco explains what happens when David Chase invites you to dinner.There are clips of the infamous ""ducks"" from the pilot, and Chase comments on the critical raves that immediately rolled in - plus the pressures of additional seasons. Writer-Producer Terrence Winter joined the show in the second season, and he's interviewed here. Winter has since gone on to write and/or produce projects such as ""Boardwalk Empire"" and THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), the latter of which got him an Oscar nomination.The deaths of Nancy Marchand and series star James Gandolfini are handled with grace, including a clip of an emotional Chase speaking at Gandolfini's funeral. We hear about the toll playing Tony took on Gandolfini, and how some of the cast were there for him in times of darkness and need. Gandolfini died in 2013 at age 51 from a heart attack. It's interesting to learn that Chase only directed two episodes himself - the first and the last. And speaking of the finale, we see clips of Holsten's and hear ""Don't Stop Believin"" while reliving how that finale shocked viewers and generated so much discussion. Chase addresses this by saying, ""The truth is ...""

3,7,"Not great, but pretty good.",Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"Alex Gibney has been behind some good documentaries, and The Sopranos is - yes - one of the greatest shows ever made, if not the greatest show ever made. So expectations for something like Wise Guy: David Chase and The Sopranos are allowed to be high, especially given this clocks in at a beefy 160 minutes (it's technically a miniseries, but it's comprised of two ""episodes"" that both released at the same time, so it's easy to watch as one big movie, effectively).There is so much to say about The Sopranos, so I feel this could've been an actual miniseries. More could've been covered, but it's a little strange that with what they chose to cover, there was still a bit of repetition. It exists in a strange and flabby middle ground between being a tight two-hour movie and being a multi-hour TV series. Honestly, they could've quite comfortably spent an hour on each season, and made the whole thing 7-ish hours long, a little like The Beatles Anthology miniseries, which spends 60 to 70 minutes per year The Beatles were around, on average.To get one more complaint out of the way, Wise Guy makes a terrible first impression. The editing feels like it's trying to speedrun the background info on Chase's pre-Sopranos life, and the result is awkward.Actually, another (minor) complaint. Wise Guy brings up some fairly tired things I feel have been talked about to death regarding The Sopranos, but maybe that's because I've probably spent as much time reading about The Sopranos and watching videos about it than I have spent watching the show (and I've seen it three times, front to back).But this is generally quite good, especially once you get past that awkward opening. The behind-the-scenes footage is valuable, and the doc's at its best when it focuses on Chase and his relationship with James Gandolfini. Something 80 to 90 minutes long completely focused on that would've been remarkable, but it's still compelling as presented here.It's a good documentary on a great show. It's hard to imagine any fans of the show not getting at least a little out of it.",False
4,10,Excellent documentary on the greatest TV drama series ever made,grantss,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent documentary on the greatest TV drama series ever made. 10/10A documentary on the TV series The Sopranos: it's origins and development, making of the pilot, Season 1 and subsequent seasons, how the main characters were cast, the creative and filming processes and the public response. Told largely through interviews with creator/showrunner David Chase.The Sopranos is, for me, the greatest TV drama series of all time: a fantastic combination of family drama, crime drama and general human drama, a perfect mix of character engagement, clever plot and action. This documentary, directed by renowned documentary-maker Alex Gibney (Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, The Looming Tower, amongst others), expertly captures the development of the series and the creative processes behind it. David Chase's history is also examined - this has a large bearing on the many of the themes and plots in The Sopranos.The casting decisions are very interesting and demonstrate how a perfect person for a part can be found and a career made simply by chance. The number of unsuccessful interviewees and why they didn't succeed (and, for some, how this possibly turned out to be a good thing as they ended up in another, more iconic, role) is also quite illuminating.We also see the other end of the character/actor arc, as characters, and thus actors, are written out of the series. This was quite poignant in some cases.Highly engaging as we experience the highs and lows with David Chase and some of the cast and crew.A must-see for Sopranos fans and for anyone who likes to see how high-quality entertainment is produced.",False
5,10,"Sopranos Heart, Soul & Brains Confesses",Overly-Critical,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerUNBELIEVABLE... The David Chase conflates the character of his life (Tony Soprano) within therapy sessions and finally squeals (sings like a soprano) his confession of building the Soprano's television series.So many of us can personally relate to the EXACT same experiences of David's presumed unique experiences with the characteristics of his mother.Very few of us however, can actually verbalize our experiences (legally or otherwise-guy) with; Mom, Dad, siblings, associates, as so eloquently as David, let alone run a show, run a writing Academy and regurgitate page after page of intense real-life dialogue.This documentary style program far surpasses any to-date attempt to resurrect the life and times of Tony Soprano. We the viewers are treated to the origin of The Soprano's characters & stories, and David's evolution within the story telling business, becoming writer/director of an iconic series. For almost a decade, David and cable television's Home Box Office locked out one hour of our Sunday entertainment.My review is ""Ten Stars"" and knowing full-well that it is the ONLY APPROPRIATE rating, and also knowing I could never do justice to reviewing anything produced by David and the immaculate cast & crew. So... PLEASE SOPRANOS FANS ""Do yourself a favor"" and watch this thing.Ciao!",True
6,10,Masterful!,UniqueParticle,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been ready for this after watching Sopranos recently on HBO signature almost daily this week and I've seen the series a few times it's one of the best shows ever surprised there hasn't been a documentary sooner. David Chase is a genius all around and great of the director to make this 2 part documentary. I love the talent put into everything it's heartwarming learning about the background, worthy of high ratings and and spectacular vibe all around as should be for one of the best series the behind stuff better be great too! Nice to learn about the darkness more and how they didn't do it just for the sake of it. Highly recommend this magnificent mini doc series.",False
7,8,Can't Get Enough,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are like me and can't get enough of the Sopranos this is a really great two part documentary. This conversation with David Chase and the world of the hit HBO Show in the year of the 25th Anniversary is worth watching. There is great footage from the history of the show and a ton of behind the scenes footage from the making of it. There are conversations with HBO Executives, Cast Members, Writers, and people related to the show. I loved the audition footage. The documentary takes the viewer on the journey from concept to creation and more. This is a good documentary and doesn't suffer from the disease of being too long, which many documentaries do.",False
8,10,Very Emotionally Satisfying,rodsullivan-51394,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found myself tearing up, thinking about all the great scenes and characters, and most of all about the creative process. This series didn't just happen. It came together with a lot of hard work by everyone involved.My wish is this: that Alex Gibney, or someone, will do a follow-up like Wise Guy, about The Wire. Perhaps David Simon could be the focal point, perhaps Ed Burns, perhaps a dozen other people, but like The Sopranos, The Wire created a world foreign to the viewers, that became so believable that you became part of it.Hearing about David Chase drawing 13 lines down a page, then adding the character names, then creating a story arc for each-then bringing it into the Writers room to create 13 teleplays-it sounds simple but is fascinating. Then, the actors. James putting a sharp stone in his shoe to make himself angry, Andrianna finding out she was going to be killled at the end of the season, Pauli Walnuts and the hair. So much went into it, and the result was fantastic.",False
9,10,A lot of questions answered!,cwiggins-11249,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a huge Sopranos fan. I had many questions about the talent searches, the writers, and how all of the series would come together. David Chase has always struck me as aloof, but my opinion now is that he's direct and poignant. He's. Never going to cow-tow to convention, and won't bend to social pressure. That certainly shows in the final scene. When the screen went black, I was stunned, but after thought I understood what the director wanted; for people to have their own ending. I felt the same way when No Country for Old Men ended. It didn't end in a wrapped bow. Which was fine. Life doesn't work out with a pretty bow all the time, so why should every movie? Anyway, the Wise Guy was really interesting and I'm happy to have closure 😊",False
10,7,What I Found Interesting Was How The Actors Were Shattered ....,kevin-12921,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat I found interesting was how the actors were shattered when their jobs were taken away. As Chase said, it is a mob show and people will die. On the other hand this is what they do to put food on the table.1) Nancy Marchand who played Livia Soprano. Apparently her character was going to be strangled by Tony. When she heard about it or read it in the script she asked Chase to keep her working since she had lung cancer and emphysema.2) Drea de Matteo who played Adriana La Cerva. She knew there were two versions of that episode shot; One where she lives and one where she dies. HBO has a confidentiality rule so no one is supposed to know the outcome until it airs. However, she knew she was a goner and had to take another acting job which blew that secret out-of-the-water.3) Vincent Pastore as Salvatore 'Big Pussy' Bonpensiero. It seems the other actors lobbied for him to get one more season. Although he did.appear in 4 more episodes either in flashback or as a spirit/ghost.",True
11,9,"Who knew , David chase was really Tony Soprano",nicktusk-95591,n/a,16/08/2025,"The verb beginning part it shows a lot of David Chase's history, and it shows pictures of him as a young man and he Tough he only stands about 5 foot eight. I guess reading an interview. I research this that Tony Sirico said ""if there's any man I would fear it's David Chase"" Not saying that Chase is the ultimate bad ass sociopath but he did look like a tough guy even for being a little dude scrappy. I mean I'm born in 1980 but I could just tell by looking at them back then he was a tough guy. I'm sure a lot of stuff they wrote about they did on the show and I think ultimately this is a great documentary that shows that maybe David Chase Was actually Tony soprano.",False
12,4,"""Not the ending you wanted to see"" Lazy?",allanmichael30,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler ""nothing to see here""
It was exposed in trailers the essence of this documentary interview. If you watched sopranos then you do not need to see this. This is 99% showing footage and 10% talking about it. The series was a reality series fly on the wall of ganster life, no holds bard.They showed us everything,well almost, it was ugly and car crash t.v.It showed a bit about disagreement over pay and that's public knowledge.The Many Saints of Newark Sopranos prequel was made in to film and not talked about. Why? -Was it because it flopped.Why make this now?Are they thinking of making new series and could his son take over the buisness.People watch lots of boxset and considering numbers they are deemed successful.I just don't feel this series is watchable again and unlike Godfather movie.It was cut so close to bone that the cast were effected by how close this was to the dark side of the mob as well as viewer.",False
13,10,I thought black meant death!,royal-akshendra-rathore,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLoved it, it was like I watched the entire series again. I loved the techniques used by David Chase to write episodes in a season. Shows how much disciplined he was. I am sure he must have pissed off lot of people during the shoot, but now they know why. I didn't knew Tony resembles his own character so much and I miss James Gandolfini, RIP, what you gonna do! Tony affected Jimmy's life. It also made me think that sometimes actors who are true to their characters can cause harm to their own life.The documentary spills the story from the creator himself David Chase, and it made me think how challenging can it be to surpass your own expectations and still dtay unsatisfied.",True
14,8,The Mind That Thought Up The Greatest Show Of All Time,Jeppe_Kleijngeld,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a devoted fan of 'The Sopranos' - my all-time favorite show - I thought there wasn't much left for me to discover. But HBO's new two part documentary 'Wise Guy: David Chase and The Sopranos' offers fresh insight, focusing primarily on the mastermind behind the series, David Chase, especially in its first half. Chase (1945) is a compelling figure: intelligent, introspective, and a natural storyteller. Director Alex Gibney ('Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson', 'Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room') places Chase in a metaphorical psychiatrist's chair, allowing him to speak candidly about his upbringing, his eccentric mother, dreams, death, and how these themes shaped 'The Sopranos'. Chase recalls his time in college down south, which he disliked, though he was exposed to European cinema by directors like Godard, Bergman, and Fellini. ""I saw '8½', and I don't think I understood it, but it blew my mind"", he reflects. This experience ignited his desire to become a filmmaker, leading him to study at Stanford's film school. The documentary even shows part of his student film - a gangster story with an attempted Godard flair, which is amusing in its ambition. While Chase's destiny wasn't in film directing, he found his calling in television. He worked on successful shows like 'The Rockford Files' and 'Northern Exposure', but his true breakthrough came when HBO greenlit 'The Sopranos' in 1998. The series became a cultural phenomenon, and Chase infused it with deeply personal elements, including therapy sessions and his tumultuous relationship with his mother. Other talented writers like Robin Green and Terence Winter also contributed significantly to the show's depth. In 'The Offer', a recent series about the making of 'The Godfather', we learn that Coppola saw the film as a commentary on capitalism. Similarly, 'The Sopranos' carries an underlying critique of America's decline. As Chase puts it, ""Americans have gotten so materialistic and selfish that it made a mob boss sick."" That vision, combined with Chase's storytelling genius, is part of what makes 'The Sopranos' so enduringly powerful.",False
15,1,"Not much here, mostly a resume for David Chase",Xavier_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"For anyone who has watched every episode of the Sopranos there is little extra footage here. Mostly rehashing the series and throwing in a few tidbits here and there.The target audience is for people who haven't seen the show and casual viewers.This mostly reads as a resume and a reminder that David was a writer in one of the most successful television series for HBO.There is a reason why he hasn't been able to work in Hollywood in almost 20 years, and it's because of his incredibly botched black screen fade out ending series finale.Those defending him might say he had writer's block, was rushed and left it open for interpretation. He honestly didn't put in the hard work and effort to finish it.In the lead up to the last scene, Meadow is struggling to parallel park for 3 of the final 5 minutes in a series finale. This is unforgivable and proof that he just ran out of ideas.He has been banished from Hollywood, and rightfully so. Even his terrible Saints of Newark was bad and was his only shot at a comeback which failed. He's asking for another chance here. Don't give him one.You'd think that after 20 years of being out of work David would put some major effort into Saints? But nope, minimum effort. It's sad, because he really did write some good episodes. 1/10, tarnished legacy attempting to resurrect it again.",False

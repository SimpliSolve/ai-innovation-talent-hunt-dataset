1,1,I love Jennifer Aniston,dewlover420,n/a,15/08/2025,"But this was a waste of time. Very surface level, and mostly information I already knew.There's also an Adam Sandler documentary this year. If that sucks, I hope a trend isn't started where celebrities get horrible documentaries made on each other.",False
2,n/a,"A ""zero budget"" Production",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I suspect this ""film"" cost almost no money to put together. It's mostly comments by one or two ""Entertainment Reporters"" who frequently appears on screen, and a narrator who doesn't.I could be wrong, but I really think everything else in the ""film"" is just public domain or otherwise free-to-use footage, mostly promotional materials.I can't think of anything I'd like to say is particularly ""wrong"" with this production, but unless you're just too lazy or apathetic, you'd probably have a better experience just googling her, or searching for promos and interviews on YouTube, just as the producers of this likely did.To be honestly, I myself did watch the whole ""film"", but for just that reason... after forming some opinions about it (and Jennifer) I just didn't care enoug to do my own research and just let the ""film"" play out.",False

1,8,A Loving Look Back at a show I loved but is missing something,cadfile,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally after 3 long years Attack of the Doc is released. I contributed to the 2nd Kickstarter and got my Blu-ray the other day.Tip of the hat to Chris Gore and company for an excellent production for a majority of the film. I laughed quite a bit at some of the old bits and smiled when a clip brought back a fond memory of the show and the various hosts. I watched from the beginning of the show to the end and I liked Screen Savers and was mad when it went away for Attack of the Show but I learned to love the AOTS.I do have some complaints. There are no actual interviews with Kevin, Olivia, Candace, Sara or any of the show hosts and bit players. We hear producers and other behind the camera people talking about the hosts but no interviews with them. I was disappointed.I think they should have ended the doc with the end of the show in 2013. They could have added the bit about the reboot in 2021 as an extra because since the reboot ended before the film was released there seems to be a missing piece of the story - maybe that is why there aren't any interviews with people like Kevin and the other hosts?I thought the segment talking about all the offensive bits they did on the show that probably couldn't be done today was ham-fisted. The gaming community has a bad rep of being toxic and ATOS probably played into that back then. Evolving to being funny without hurting people is something to be admired not lamented. Yes, the fat suit bit was funny then for people who like to make fun of fat people for no real reason but enlightened people know better today. Someone like Olivia could jump into a pool of pudding today just not wearing a French maid costume. I did like Kevin back then wearing a maid outfit too in the bit.Overall, I loved the documentary and I am glad it was made even if it isn't perfect.",False
2,8,Attack of the Show G4 Documentary,zrcdhcjnt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary movies are not my go to when I want to watch something, but this one was awesome. It sent me right down memory lane! It's just a great movie and plenty of fun to watch for anyone into nerd culture.Chris Gore did a great job telling the story of the tv show, as well as some subtle and relevant commentary on the early 2000's compared to today in 2023.Fans of the G4 channel would also enjoy this movie even if they did not watch Attack of the Show. It has a great sense of humor throughout the movie and delivers an interesting timeline of events.If you were a fan of Attack of the Show than it's a must see!",False
3,8,Fun to Watch and Left Me Smiling,christophermoonlight,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't play video games and I never watched this show when it was on, so I was a little lost at the beginning because there isn't a lot of context for viewers in this particular instance. I came by this documentary because I'm a fan of Film Threat Magazine, which produced it. The story assumes you know what the show is and who the hosts are. This isn't a terrible sticking point because the titles tell you up front that this is, ""for the fans and by the fans."" So, I stuck with it, keeping that in mind. As the movie goes on you do learn all about both the show and the people involved, leaving you with a real sense of affection for them by the end. It's clear that the Attack of the Show was something special for the fans and the creators. You have fun watching highlights and being taken back to a time before the internet changed everything. It was also cool for me, as someone who had been going to Comic-Con since before it blew up to watch footage of a time and place I lived through. I remember that two-story G4 podium even though I wasn't really aware of what was going on there because I had different focuses at the time. Ultimately, it was an extremely entertaining documentary that will leave you feeling energized with a smile on your face. Whether you know the show or not, it's a recommend from me.",False
4,10,It's a Buy!,banthasalesman,n/a,16/08/2025,"So many memories, so many laughs and of course Olivia Munn.Chris Gore has managed to achieve what I thought was unattainable, he's made an amazing film/documentary about G4 and their flagship show Attack of the Doc. In my opinion it's completely unbiased and shows just why we all
loved the show so much.Of course the chemistry between Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn helped sell that show, the fact they were up for anything just allowed the show to be as zany and crazy as the fans could hope for.I'll say it again, with this film Chris Gore has managed to create something that hits all the fans of those heady G4 days right in the feels. We loved that show.",False
5,10,Must Watch for Nerds!,sgranthobson,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary about the good old time of nerd culture. It not only follows the rise and fall of G4 but has a larger message about what it means to be a fan. This doc reminds us that we can have friends that we disagree with. That people are capable of having different views on (Star Wars, Star Trek, Halo, Marvel, etc.) than you and that doesn't make them the enemy. This doc brings us back to the time when we were united against the mainstream, outcast by the world we clung together and made a space where all nerds were welcome. And now that space has gotten so large that faction have formed and turned against one another. This doc is a must watch for any and all nerds.On a technical level, the film is well shot and paced perfectly. Hats off the the production team, you guys did an amazing Job!",False
6,10,A must watch,looman2,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a fan from the early days , the screen savers on.But I want to review this from the viewpoint of my wife , my wife only knew what I had mentioned from early memories of many years of entertainment juxtaposed with what she saw of the abomination and or g4bortion and hate filled relaunch.The documentary gave her a glimpse of what the show actually had to offer back in the day, just pure fun and entertainment, she loved the doc, it made her understand why the relaunch was such a disappointment and what made the old show so missed by so many.Make movies and tv for audiences and entertainment not for ESG pointsGreat job Mr Gore.",False
7,3,"A Review of ""Attack of the Doc!""",Mario500,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had found certain parts of what I had believed to had been this ""Attack of the Doc!"" to had been vulgar (or profane), unnecessary, unprofessional, negative, disgusting, and detrimental (especially toward certain parts of it I had found to had been interesting and informative). I had also wished it had been more serious, more pleasant, and more professional (while still being entertaining).(note: if there were to be a future documentary similar to this one, I would suggest it be a series of documentary segments (or installments or episodes) not just about the TV program for which this one was about (""Attack of the Show!""), but also about the history of its broadcaster (G4 (or G4TV originally)) and the history of the broadcaster with which it was merged (TechTV (or ZDTV originally))",False
8,10,Great Doc worth the few bucks,drkstar-94385,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been waiting 4 this Doc since Chris started talking about on Nerdrotics n Film Threat. It was worth the wait n few bucks to get. Its great to see the evolution of G4 n Attack of the Show. To see the old gang. Kevin n Olivia of Course but also Sarah Lane Kevin Rose The Screensaver guys. ALL OF EM. It. Reminds you of a time when ppl could laugh n take a joke.when not every thing wasn't so serious. When we didn't have ro worry about hurting everyone's feel feels lol. It was the start of show hey this""nerd"" stuff isn't bad at all..it's kinda cool. Comic con n all those other one owe there now mainstream popularity to G4 n Attack of the Show...peroid. N well Chris Gore. It was his idea 2 go. Hell of job Chris.",False
9,1,7.5 stars for this? Really?,TheOneThatYouWanted,n/a,16/08/2025,"They made attack of the show boring some how..why?? Did someone die or something? This is borderline depressing for such a fun show many of us loved. How.. the hell..do you make Attack of the Show! Boring? Seriously, whoever produced this or directed this should just stop. Attack of the show was not boring, fun, fast and awesome. I kept checking if it was almost finished yet like every 20 minutes then every ten minutes and now I'm literally writing this review and will work on writing other reviews and then comeback and finish this review after this boring a$$ documentary finishes. First off, this is about attack of the show. So why talk about G4 so much? And then the dumb stuff they did later? They even made the comic-con stuff su#k. I think I know the problem, it is whoever the guys are talking over this damn documentary. An the strangest thing about this lame documentary, they hardly talk about Olivia Munn. I think whoever made this just worked on the show and they wanted their 15 minutes of fame, so they gave us this trash. Maybe they wanted to kill Attack of the show! And Attack of the show was big before Big Bang Theory. Why? Just why? The end credits with the superhero thing is better than this doc and you are wrong, Chris. Attack of the doc is not a buy. It is a bye.",False
10,10,Must watch feel good fun!,cooleycollege,n/a,16/08/2025,"If there was a way to encapsulate the idea and feeling of G4 and Attack of the Show, Attack of the Doc is it. The show oozes the genuinely charming and sometimes hokey fun of the original material. Love the respect for all those involved too. While its unfortunate we did not get to have Kevin or Olivia directly interviewed for the doc, I feel those we do hear from to be insightful and witty on the subject. The music is impressive and adds to the feel in positive ways. Also, remember to stay after the credits for a special scene you won't want to miss, super funny Chris! Have some fun and remember yester year!",False
11,10,Bravo Chris Gore An Ode to G4 and geek and nerd culture - stay through the credits two thumbs up!,scottgmckenzie,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOverall, ""Attack of the Doc"" is a must-see for fans of G4 and anyone interested in the history of geek culture. Chris Gore has done an excellent job of capturing the essence of G4 and why it was such an essential part of pop culture in the early 2000s.The documentary provides an excellent overview of the development and evolution of geek and nerd culture, from its early days as a niche interest to its status as a mainstream phenomenon. It explores how movies, TV shows, and comics have influenced this culture and how it has, in turn, influenced these mediums.One of the film's strengths is its use of interviews with prominent geek and nerd culture figures, including creators and directors like Jon Favreau's Ironman 1 and 2 and James Cameron of Avatar. These interviews provide valuable insights into what makes these franchises unique and why they have resonated with audiences for many years.The documentary also features much archival footage from their shows, which will surely be nostalgic for geek and nerd culture fans of the show and in general. The film's pacing and editing are also excellent, making for a smooth and enjoyable viewing experience. And also gets into why these stunts bits and skits could not be done in today's woke and PC culture. Very sad! Though he does mention some YouTubers towards the end who are keeping the spirit of geekdom and nerdom alive and well challenging the new norms and being independent creatorsOverall, ""Attack of the Doc"" is a must-see for anyone interested in geek and nerd culture. Chris Gore has done an excellent job of capturing the essence of this culture and why it is such an essential part of pop culture today. The documentary provides a fascinating insight into this beloved community's past, present, and future. And stay through the credits - I highly recommend this for G4 fans, geeks, and nerds.",True
12,10,This is a buy!,inkedit,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who was very young when G4 started and only started watching just before it went off the air, it was fascinating to learn more about how G4 TV got started and what lead to it's ultimate cancellation. Chris and his team do a great job showing the impact G4 had on pop culture in the early 2000's and they cover quite a bit in the hour and a half runtime.One of the most interesting things this doc shows is how TV and then the Internet changed how fans could get together and talk about the things they love...for better or for worse. I still have a lot of nostalgia for the mid 2000's when I was growing up and this doc seemed to transport me back.Attack of the Doc! Delivered on what I expected of it an more which is why I think it deserves 10/10. For a documentary, it was well produced and edited together.As far as I am concerned, this movie is a buy!",False
13,10,Attack of the Doc is a Must See for all AOTS fans,bob_rose,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off let me preface by saying Im the ideal audience for this. I was a big fan of G4 and watched Attack of the Doc every evening after work.Chris Gore does a fantastic job helping us relive the past while also pulling back the curtain and giving us a lot of unique behind the screen stories that took place on set.It's a fascinating look back and study of a show from a time thats been almost forgotten.In the times of ""woke"" it's refreshing seeing how Attack of the Show really pushed social norms . Even though a lot of the humor wouldn't ""land"" today the youthful energy reminded me of early MTV.A must buy for Generation X's and for Generation X as well.Get the Blu-ray, it's packed with extras!!",False

1,7,"Held My Attention, But What A Mess",Mehki_Girl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was never WW fan. Never Heard he3 on radio. Didn't know she existed until I heard about her because of her talk show. I've seen a couple of parts of her show. I can see some of her appeal.I'm a little more interested in her since her diagnosis because that's a very human thing and because now that I've seen what a hot mess she was/is, she more interesting as a person than a personality.I first watched the Where's Wendy doc and then this. I found it kinda annoying, especially the weird constant crying.With celebs that are always on, you never know what's a real emotion and what's for the camera. Regardless, I think she was really hurt by her husband and who wouldn't be.But on the other hand, you knew he was cheating for years, so the grieving should have happened and been over long before now.She did manage some restraint. I'll give her that, because if I saw my husband Backwards Barbie riding in my Rolls, I'd be he up on charges lol!But then that's the reason why you don't take a man off the street, then clothe, house, feed, and employ him. Leave him right where you found him. You didn't need him. You were already made.Everything was your choice. You do exactly what you want and from what I can see from the doc, you always have, regardless of what's best or what the people who love you want. So stop crying and feeling sorry for yourself.",True
2,9,Was candid,harewoodtg,n/a,16/08/2025,She really just lets loose with minimal make up and LOTS of crying. I think that was really candid of her. I just wish she addressed the 2020 alleged hospitalization that Black Lives Matter news over shadowed.,False
3,1,Nothing is her fault!,MichaelKeith,n/a,16/08/2025,"How does a person say, they don't regret anything bc it's all made them the person they are and then turn around and say EVERYTHING is someone else's fault.SMH, WHAT A MESS is very accurate!",False
4,9,Honest as possible,sye_here,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wendy shared her soul with this. I genuinely felt she was as honest with the audience as she is with herself. Great documentary. I have a lot more admiration for her.I would have liked to hear more about the early period of her show, but that's my only complaint.",False
5,10,New fan,sahmuia-27499,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm just now finishing this series.I wasn't really aware of her body of work, except maybe her Joan Rivers-esque style of entertainment.I now wish I could meet her and give her a warm hug. She's been used and abused, like many of us, but did it in the public eye.This was hard to watch and so, so brave.If you are a woman, this will speak to you. Forget about the fame and fortune for a minute. No matter our station in life, most, if not all of us can recall bits and pieces of her story in our own story.Insecurities about our beauty, our bodies, relationships, parenthood all linger in our hearts and minds if we came up in the last couple thousand years.Wendy, darling, I got you. I bet I'm far from alone.I've walked a mile in your magnificent shoes, but not on a public stage.I bid you nothing but peace.In health,
Nurse Robin.",False

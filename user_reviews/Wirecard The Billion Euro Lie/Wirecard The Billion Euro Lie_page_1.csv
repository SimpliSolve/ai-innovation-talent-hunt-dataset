1,n/a,shocking,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have read a few small articles in newspapers about this giant scandal, but did not really pay much attention to it. Then the last couple of months the name Wirecard got dropped a few times in connection with potential corruption in the Austrian government or people that have connections to it. Last night I found this documentary on SKY, after I had seen a few ads for it on TV and went for it.Rarely has a docu kept me on the edge of the seat like this one.How over nearly two decades a few shady characters could ""create money"" out of nothing. From the early stages of doing payment processing for porn and gambling sites, to the centre of power and might.I dont want to spoil any content so all I can say is: hats off to the whistleblowers, they are real heros. You have to see this film to believe how twisted the whole thing was/is.Job very well done, more thrilling than plenty of crime films.",False
2,10,Kept me at the edge of my seat,sam-98211,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc was just impeccable. While I read about lots about the Wirecard scandal in the last couple months, I never really understood how this all came about. This movie tells the story of the whistleblowers as well as the story of the rise and downfall of Wirecard in such an exciting and eloquent way! The music was also really really good. Would recommend this to anyone.",False
3,9,Never trust a company led by a Robocop villain,endelgs,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an epic documentary about money laundering. Apart from some corporate/finance slang, narrative is fun and relatively easy to keep up with. Cartoons used to depict unfilmed situations are more interesting than just repeating the same pictures over and over like I've seen in a couple documentaries.The story really keeps you watching but sometimes there's just too much to process - like when the story starts to spread to multiple countries in a matter of a couple minutes - but I don't really see how to overcome this as most details showed relevant to the story afterwards.Really worth watching, apart from the compelling story it's also a fun piece to watch.Never trust a company whose CEO is Clarence Boddicker.",False

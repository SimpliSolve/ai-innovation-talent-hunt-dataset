I bought their album Maka shortly after and from there got into Lee Perry et al.This film brought all that, and much more, back in a wonderful mix of nostalgia, joy and sadness.Nostalgia aside, this film shines a spotlight on the roots of reggae in a post-windrush Britain. The intimate access to the band members and those involved in the Jamaican community in Harlesdon in the 6late sixties and early seventies provide an authenticity missing in many music documentaries.There is wonderful early archive footage of the band to accompany the interviews and contemporary clips. The overall package is beautifully put together and obviously the work of a fan of both the band and the genre.I cried a couple of times.",False

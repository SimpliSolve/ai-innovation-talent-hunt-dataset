1,8,worth seeing to understand the world around us better,milly903md,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was excited to see there was something about sensory overload, I'm nerudovergent myself and a therapist, and seeing how many people struggle with sensory issues and don't know how to take care of themselves because they don't understand what it is as well as others judging and marginalizing them for the same reason is heartbreaking.Overall it is sponsored by the dentistry industry so it focuses primarily on sensory issues of autistic people in dental care, and it makes sense and it's a really good initiative to bring awareness and inclusion. However it shows only a rather specific part of the more general sensory processing disorder.I was hoping to see more science explaining what happens in the neurodivergent brains, what exactly is a sensory processing difference, how different they can be (sensitive to sound, to touch, smells, light, taste), how to recognise them in others, maybe some mention of Highly Sensitive Persons (HSP) as a result of trauma as well even outside neurodiversity. ADHD isn't brought up while it accounts for a large part of the highly functional and often undiagnosed population that struggles with that as well, and the way this film makes sensory issues seem only be specific to autism. It would have been helpful to learn ways to help people when they have a sensory overload meltdown, or how to prevent one.Overall it was well done presenting the experiences and stories of real people, this is so necessary to bring awareness and compassion and foster more understanding towards the need for sensory inclusive spaces.As the world evolves, we are more and more exposed to sounds that are not natural and are overwhelming to our brains, and more and more people will struggle with sensory issues.",False
2,10,A Powerful Window into Sensory Sensitivities,PatriciaA-15,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Sensory Overload"" is a compelling and insightful documentary that offers a much-needed exploration of the challenges faced by individuals with sensory processing issues. The film effectively presents diverse perspectives, featuring personal stories from individuals across various walks of life, including filmmaker Spike Lee, the experiences of 38-year-old autistic twins, and a dentist who has transformed his practice to be more sensory-inclusive. The documentary participants poignantly illustrate the daily struggles and the urgent need for greater awareness and accommodation.For me, ""Sensory Overload"" was more than just an informative film; it was a deeply personal experience. As a parent of adult sons whose autism spectrum disorder was not well understood or diagnosed in their youth, the film provided crucial insight and understanding that was previously unavailable. The information presented offered a new lens through which to comprehend their past struggles and offered valuable knowledge that could potentially improve their lives today.""Sensory Overload"" is not only an eye-opening experience for those with a personal connection to sensory processing issues. It is an essential viewing for anyone seeking to broaden their understanding of neurodiversity and to create a more inclusive and compassionate world.",False

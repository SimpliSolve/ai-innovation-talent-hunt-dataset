He was so joyful and loving and was an example of how to suffer with Christ and for Christ. He was an excellent priest who sacrificed so much for his flock and is a modern day saint!

This movie will inspire a great deal of young people, like myself, to take up the call and to follow the Lord's will for their lives! Fr. Ryan's life showed what holiness looks like in an ordinary young priest and it is a life that is attractive and will bring many to loving God's will in a much deeper way!",False
2,10,Love in Action: A Review of 'The True Story of Fr Ryan,gordon-31505,n/a,16/08/2025,"The True Story of Fr Ryan is not one that focuses on his life but rather on the fruit his life bore. Somehow, in 57 minutes, this simple film was able to portray all that Fr Ryan desired to convey in his years here on Earth.And the message is simple and the call is clear: You shall love God with your whole heart, your whole soul, and your whole mind. And you shall love your neighbor as yourself. Even in spite of circumstance, suffering, pain, fear, sorrow, shame, etc.The witnesses in this film and being witness to this film, one is taken deeper into their own reflection on their life and actions and ways they can become more like Christ in every moment they have left.Please do yourself a favor and watch and share this film.",False

You can feel every ounce of love and dedication it took to make this film from start to finish. Getting to know the story and legacy of Fr. Ryan Stawaisz is another step closer to getting to know God and how He perfectly shares His love with us, even in the most unimaginable circumstances.

4,10,You will never be the same after experiencing this film!,smsenia,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being immersed in the story of Fr. Ryan Stawaisz while viewing this film will impact your heart forever. You will meet a young man who selflessly lays aside a promising career in engineering to follow God's will for his life - which is to serve God's people as a Catholic priest. And not only follow God's will, but Fr. Ryan learns to LOVE God's will - even when it involves great suffering. Fr. Ryan never ceases to give everything he has to model the love of Christ to everyone in his path. Can I say the same about myself? This film has convicted me and challenged me to also radiate the love of Christ to everyone I encounter - not an easy task.",False
5,10,An emotional telling of an inspiring life,spease-57910,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fr. Ryan is an inspiration to us all. Not because of Fr. Ryan but because of God using Fr. Ryan through his calling. Emotional, inspiring, profound. Thank you for showing real love for God's will. Fr. Ryan lived out the phrase ""Jesus with skin on."" People saw Jesus in Fr. Ryan because he lived like Jesus. In the midst of personal struggle and illness, the light of The Lord shines through. The sheer volume of videos from Fr. Ryan's childhood and seminary and college years, coupled with actual preaching of the Word shows the light that shined through his life. A local priest shared his experience getting to know Fr. Ryan briefly before he died proving that the story and the life reflect ""the real deal."" Jesus changes lives.",False
6,10,"A Film about a Father that favors Faith, Family, and Friends",wyattgoolsby,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love God's Will is an inspiring documentary that calls for the audience attention from beginning to end. Father Ryan Stawaisz steadfast devotion to his ministry will especially appeal to people of faith, but leaves the door open for anyone who might be curious about the life of a Catholic priest.Much credit should be given to the filmmakers. A project that began as an idea for a 7-minute short film blossomed into a 57-minute production that cohesively weaves together Father Ryan's childhood talents with his religious values. The small team who created Love God's Will were able to effectively sift through hours of interviews, 90's home videos, and Church footage to find the best material needed to tell Father Ryan's story. This film is highly recommended for those who enjoy stories about faith, family, and friendship.",False
7,10,Gone too soon but left a legacy of faith,cjstancil-21152,n/a,16/08/2025,"You don't need a 2 hour movie to appreciate the short but full life that Fr. Ryan led. From the moment he stepped onto the grounds of Prince of Peace Catholic Community he exuded faith and charisma. One didn't have to know him well to feel like you had known him all of your life! Before his arrival at this parish we were told that we would be receiving a recently ordained priest who, at the same time, was in another battle against cancer is his young lifetime. We weren't sure how long he would be with us but the relationships he immediately developed with parishioners was like nothing most, if not all of us, have ever seen or experienced. Warm, inviting, confident, loving and funny are but a few words to describe Fr. Ryan. No matter how he was feeling on a given day he was committed to his faith in God and his own willingness to serve others. This film was extremely well conceived and executed. It captures the ups and downs of Fr. Ryan's life from childhood until his death. Funny in several spots but also grabbed at your heart in many others. I laughed and I cried but I left the theater feeling a little closer to God and happy to have known Fr. Ryan during his short time at Prince of Peace. Sainthood may or may not be in the future for Fr. Ryan but in my eyes and heart he's already one!",False
8,10,WORTH THE WATCH!!,johannakloesel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every minute of this movie was so intentional and shares the inspiring life of Ryan Stawaisz. There were many times everyone in the theater laughed at the jokes and fun Fr. Ryan had as a kid. He was an extremely inspirational man and the film does an incredible job sharing the inspiration that he was continuing to inspire others through his story. There is no doubt that those who watch this film, including myself, want to become holier men and women not just doing God's will but LOVING God's will. Go watch this film or contact Palomita Films to get it to a theater near you!!! You will not be disappointed!",False
9,10,TRANSFORMATIONAL!,kukla-82462,n/a,16/08/2025,"The true to life story of Fr. Ryan Stawaisz is perfectly documented in this film titled, ""Love God's Will"". It represents and conveys everything Fr. Ryan would have wanted to make clear to the audience that watched it...that he truly lived a life that LOVED GOD'S WILL and that we, as God's beloved children, are called to live our lives that exact same way, despite the struggles and fears that we encounter in this life. He pursued a life devoted to God and he desired that some devotion from every person he met by showing them the kind of love God has for them. You have to watch this film...you will be inspired to grow in your faith and transform your heart to love God's will!",False
10,10,An amazingly impactful film,tombdiving,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't at my current parish when Fr. Ryan came through during his seminary years, so I didn't have the personal connection with him that so many of our parishioners had. Nevertheless, this film is a powerful testimony to the type of person that Fr. Ryan was and to the dedicated priest he became.I don't believe you can watch this film and NOT be moved to tears for the outpouring of love Fr Ryan had for everyone, and that everyone had for him.It's just so sad that such a dedicated, talented priest would not get to fulfill what would have been a fantastic life of service to God and the church.",False
11,10,A beautiful weaving of God's good plan onto film,wangwyne,n/a,16/08/2025,"His life shows how perfectly seamless God's plan for our lives are if only we can love His will. As someone who's along the journey of searching for truth and for God's will, I see through this film how much he must have loved Jesus to be able to give up what was going to be a good life for what Jesus wanted to give him. Not begrudgingly, but full of trust and joy! His witness of God's long suffering love for him and us is so clearly seen by how he lived his life and those he had come to know, even those who only knew him briefly or in passing. It is a reminder of how short our lives can be and that holiness is not for the far away and stoic, but for us here and now.",False

What a blessing to have been able to witness through this film the story of a real man who lived his life in such a Christ like manner! Just so inspiring to want to live our lives loving God's will.The use of family home videos is such a creative way to portray the genuine nature of who Father Ryan was and how he lived his life.We went to see this film as a family with our four young children and they too enjoyed the film. I don't know if they fully understood but they define left there with a sense of admiration and inspiration.We highly recommend watching this film.,False
13,10,Must see!,joeyolandry,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a beautiful testimony to a beautiful life. Fr Ryan loves a Christly example for every one of us to follow - young and old! This is a must see!Even though we did not have the pleasure of knowing him in this life, this film did a fantastic job of giving us the full picture of his life and how he listened to and followed God's Will in his life. I appreciated his friends being from different denominations, but still being a strong community for one another, even building each other up more in the kingdom of God. I left the theatre a more fulfilled person and wondering how to get more people in front of this spectacular movie.",False
14,10,An inspiration to all,katiemariekubiak,n/a,16/08/2025,"The most beautiful and heartbreaking, heartwarming, and inspirational film I have ever seen. I was in tears the whole time. I could feel the sincere love in Fr. Ryan. His love of the lord, his family, his vocation, his friends, strangers, parish community, and just anyone he came into contact with. He lived his short life to the absolute fullest and more than most will have in a long lifetime. I'm so happy this film was made and is a true testament to his life and faith. I hope that many will see this moving film and may it inspire themselves and others to be a selfless example of love. Thank you!",False

16,10,Amazing film!!!,qthhnxtqz,n/a,16/08/2025,"We are often told to accept God's will, and that He will provide for us when we need something. Father Ryan had a different perspective where he not only accepted, but LOVED what God put in his path.May we all learn to love everything that life throws our way, and learn to trust God with full abandon.This was a beautiful film that showed his devotion, perseverance, and strength. I'll never forget the scene where he was hearing confessions with an oxygen tank.Thank you to the entire Stawaisz family and Palomita Films for sharing this inspiring story with world. Father Ryan, pray for us!!!",False
17,10,A Lesson For All to Aspire To,dkam-31739,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is powerful! There are so many lessons to be learned from the life of Fr Ryan. He was such a vibrant young man and so dedicated to his Catholic faith, overcoming adversity to pursue his calling as a priest. He possessed the characteristics of great priests.... being outgoing, charismatic, intelligent... it is difficult to understand why a priest like this would be called to Heaven so soon in the midst of a shortage of priests. It's hard for us to understand God's plan but our faith teaches us not to question God's will but to LOVE God's will, just as Fr. Ryan did. I was very moved and compelled to help tell his story.",False
18,10,Life Changing!!!,eloisewestlake,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fr. Ryan was and still is SO inspiring. You will not regret watching this movie, I promise. It has such a balance of moments to laugh and cry. It will tug on your heart, mind, and soul in the most profound ways!!! The clips of Fr. Ryan's life growing up and figuring out he was called by God to be a priest were so cool. It was cool to see a regular guy with a promising career drop everything because God was tugging on his heart. It goes to show that you never know what kind of impact you will have while here in this life. This film will boost your hope and spirits that you can't leave the theater without feeling inspired!!!",False
19,10,Kept thinking about this Documentary long after I watched it,kellyzeitler,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Love Gods Will"", crafted by the visionary team at Palomita Films, stands as a testament to the boundless power of love and commitment. This remarkable documentary embarks on a profound exploration of Father Ryan's ""very normal, regular guy"" life, and his journey into priesthood.Father Ryan's unwavering commitment to priesthood shines through every frame of ""Love Gods Will"". Through intimate interviews and poignant storytelling, ""Love Gods Will"" shares the life of a young Catholic priest gone too soon.

I kept thinking about this film long after I finished watching it. It's a must see for the young and old alike!",False
20,10,An inspiring story,channapel-52744,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love that it started out as a movie to inspire young men to think about priesthood. But it also showed many other people following God just by watching Father Ryan. It really made me think about how I'm raising my kids and how we need to pray more and practice our faith as a family.I also thought it was heartbreaking, but beautiful how father Ryan's relationship was with his mother through his suffering. A lot of people thought that he suffered so well and she revealed that it was a struggle for him. It really reminded me of Mary and Jesus and how a mother truely feels her children's suffering.",False
21,10,Beautiful,maryjensanders_fightin_irish,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's hard to put into words the profound impact this movie has had on me. Though I only saw it last night, I am filled with a sense of hope about the future of the Church. Fr. Ryan was an incredibly holy person. The movie is beautifully made. The truth lifted up in the film- to Love God's Will- this phrase is a way of approaching life that changes everything for me. Thank you for making this movie so I could get a glimpse of this beautiful soul. Thank you for allowing Fr. Ryan's life to continue to spread the Gospel. May he intercede for us all. It is a brilliant film of an even more brilliant life!",False

1,8,Somewhat Conventional But Supremely Revelatory,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,15/08/2025,"I find it ironic that sometimes it takes something serious, like a documentary, to showcase the somewhat less than serious abilities of someone gifted at comedy, like actor-writer-director Gene Wilder (1933-2016). But that's just what viewers can expect from director Ron Frank's reverent but often-hilarious tribute to this iconic talent, one whose accomplishments in film, on television and on stage haven't always received the kind of recognition that they deserve. As documentaries go, this offering largely plays it straight in terms of its content and structure, exploring Wilder's roots in Milwaukee and chronicling his rise to fame, told in chronological sequence. But, despite this conventional approach, ""Remembering Gene Wilder"" offers viewers much. The film features a number of recent interviews with such collaborators as Mel Brooks, Carol Kane and Eric McCormack, as well as friends Alan Alda and Harry Connick Jr., Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz, wife Karen Wilder and an array of Hollywood production professionals. It also includes ample clips from Wilder's films, including ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967), ""The Producers"" (1967), ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (1971), ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)"" (1972), ""Blazing Saddles"" (1974), ""Young Frankenstein"" (1974) and ""See No Evil, Hear No Evil"" (1989), along with his guest appearances on television's Will & Grace (2002-2003). And then there's plenty of archive video and still photograph footage of Wilder's family, friends, influences and co-stars, those who helped shape him and that he, in turn, helped shape. Most importantly, though, this offering examines what made Wilder unique as an artist and as a private individual, someone known for his singular vision as a comedic (yet vulnerable) actor and as a compassionate, generous colleague toward those he loved and worked with. There's also a touching segment examining his profound but bittersweet marriage to wife and co-star Gilda Radner (1946-1989), a heartbreaking love story that brought out these personal qualities in abundance and in a very high-profile way. The result is a surprisingly eye-opening look at its subject, revealing sides of Wilder personally and professionally that many outside of his inner circle may not have known. The overall approach of this offering may not be particularly inventive, but the result is well worth a watch nevertheless.",False
2,8,Remembering a life of fate and destiny!,MyMovieTVRomance,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before I get into my review, I want to address a complaint that I've seen here from people about this documentary. No, the narration was not AI generated! It comes from his own audiobook that he did before he died. Too bad that the people criticizing this movie couldn't have taken the time to find this out instead of jumping to such incorrect conclusions. But I digress..Remembering a life of fate and destiny!For somebody who was an atheist Buddhist, he certainly talked a lot about God. I don't believe he was actually an atheist, maybe more like an agnostic. Agnostic is just don't know for sure about anything, but you can have a belief, you just don't know if it's true. I think that was Gene. I believe he did believe in God. He was just open to being wrong about it.His life was filled with evidence of God's existence as well, including so many brushes with fate. Too many to be mere coincidence. His life was filled with what I like to call Godwinks. And the beautiful thing is, he was open to the signs. He followed, where God led him. And his life was all the richer for it, full of meaning and higher purpose. He had faith.He was a good man, and that was made clear throughout this documentary. So many documentaries show that the people we like had demons. But if Gene had any demons, they were channeled through his work only. In life, this documentary shows that he was a kind, gentle, caring, and compassionate soul - who also happened to be very, very funny. In addition to comedy, he was also a great writer, and a great artist - as well as student of life. One word that kept popping up over and over to describe him was ""innocent"" and it was very innocent that made him such a good student of life. He never thought he knew more than life could teach him. He was always willing to learn, and this made him forever young at heart. It was this quest learning that introduced him to his last wife, that he was married to until death did part. But because I know that somewhere inside him, he knew God, he must be in heaven now, watching over his beloved.God bless you, Gene Wilder! You made the world a better place just by being the beautiful man that you were.",False
3,9,Fit For Family Viewing!,wgbarry,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ludicrous MA rating on Netflix. Really? This was a kind and wholesome look at Gene Wilder as a person and his unique career.The last section of his life with dementia is especially moving. Though this documentary doesn't include all his work, all the obvious high points are explored .What's remarkable as a side note is the longevity of the now 98 year old Mel Brooks, who crucially helped create Wilder's career. His sense of loss is palpable.Overall this is as good a documentary as could done.MA must be a lazy marketing gimmick, since it suggests raw material. This is as sweet a production befitting Wilder's gentle persona.",False
4,10,"Intelligent, Warm, Funny. Perfect Tribute to Wilder",judyprincz,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved this film. The writer and director matched Gene Wilder's wit, heart, and humanity with their own. They brought Gene Wilder to life. It's a wonderful celebration of Wilder's life and art. I laughed throughout and it inspired me to see some of the films I've missed. Reminded me of the one I loved the most: The Fresco Kid. The interviews with people he worked with, including some child actors, were a wonderful added dimension. And the film brings some important lessons about life's difficulties. Not writing more. No spoilers. But watch this. You will be so glad you did. This film left its mark on me.",False
5,10,You'll love him even more!,angelcastles,n/a,15/08/2025,"An absolute gem of a documentary. Lovingly done. Much of it narrated by Gene himself. Stories of his upbringing, his family, his successes, his collaborators, and his loves. Beautifully directed. With tender stories told by Mel Brooks, Rain Pryor (Richard Pryor's daughter) and his last wife Karen. I was not aware of his later years. They are described with some detail. A tragic ending for a man whose quick wit, comedic timing, and athletic ability failed him towards the end. The song he listened to while fading away will surely bring a tear to your eye. Alzheimers is a horrific disease. Born Jerome Silverman, he died Wilder. A must see for all fans of this comic genius! Very highly recommended.",False
6,7,A Celebration of Wilder That's Only Sporadically Revealing,EUyeshima,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're looking for a celebration of Gene Wilder's life and career, as well as confirmation of his legacy as a beloved performer, this quickly paced 2023 documentary from director Ron Frank and writer Glenn Kirschbaum will probably suit your needs just fine. All his most famous work and personal details are covered - the fabled collaborations with Mel Brooks, his later commercial successes with Richard Pryor, his brief and tragic marriage to Gilda Radner - as well as none-too-revealing snippets of interviews with colleagues and friends like Brooks. There's even voiceover narration from Wilder himself from his audiobook of his 2005 memoirs. Still, the film felt lacking in providing what particularly drove his creativity and ambition and how he handled professional failures after he peaked with ""Young Frankenstein"". Other than ""The Producers"", little was shared of his more obscure films, his first two marriages, and his estranged daughter. His final years, however, were covered respectfully with his happy fourth marriage to hearing specialist Karen Boyer and his 2016 death from Alzheimer's. This film felt more like a conventional tribute than a revealing life journey.",False
7,10,Wonderful movie,kari-81806,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was such a wonderful film. It was compassionate , informative and very funny. I learned so much about Gene Wilder and remembered so many of his great lines. It was also so sad to see him declining into dementia but it was also so lovely to see his wife and friends rallying around him with so much love and support. I do wish that Ron Frank had included the fart scene from ""Blazing Saddles. That was really one of the funniest scenes in the movie although there were many funny scenes. Now I'm inspired to rewatch so many of his films and read his autobiography. What a mensch he was in all his multi-faceted endeavors!",True
8,7,"A nice, safe tribute",Katz5,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lots to enjoy here for Gene Wilder fans. Recent interviews with the likes of Mel Brooks, Harry Connick Jr. (I must've missed the movie he did with Wilder...) and Alan Alda (ditto...) It was bittersweet watching the clips of Wilder's interviews he gave in the years leading up to his death. 2016 was a terrible year for celebrity deaths and Wilder's affected as many people as David Bowie's and Prince's deaths did.The fault of the documentary comes from its focus on the movies. The Frisco Kid is given way too much screen time...while Silver Streak barely gets a mention and nothing from The Woman in Red is featured. These two movies were important in his resume as they co-starred Richard Pryor and Gilda Radner. Two people who were quite significant in Wilder's life. Bombs like Sunday Lovers, Funny About Love, and Another You were not mentioned but probably should have been as proof that not everything Wilder was in was gold.Besides The Frisco Kid, the movies that get the most attention are The Producers, Willy Wonka, and Young Frankenstein. The latter is probably peak Wilder for his career as the story was his idea and he co-wrote the screenplay with Brooks.Willy Wonka was a troubled production from Quaker Oats Cereal and did not perform well initially at the theater (its status as a beloved children's movie grew due to re-releases in the mid '70s, annual television airings in the mid to late '70s, and video in the '80s). Wilder gave the movie an edge that stayed with children after the viewing. Not much is made of this.Basically, this is a celebration of his life, and for that reason it's worth seeing. It just could have been a bit more consistent in its rundown of his movies and dug deeper into his characterizations. But that would have probably made for a much longer documentary--which he deserved. There will never be another Gene Wilder.",False
9,10,Vivid valentine to the beloved comedic icon with bittersweet joy.,george.schmidt,n/a,15/08/2025,"REMEMBERING GENE WILDER (2024) **** Gene Wilder, Gilda Radner, Mel Brooks, Richard Pryor, Alan Alda, Harry Connick, Jr., Carol Kane, Eric McCormack, Alan Zweibel, Burton Gilliam, Ben Mankiewicz, Peter Ostrum, Rain Pryor. Ron Frank's valentine of a documentary on the beloved comedic actor focuses on Wilder's theatrical and cinematic career with fond recollections by friends, family and collaborators with voice over narration provided by the late icon's audiobook biography audio mixed with clips and vintage photos of the past. The film's success is in capturing Wilder's Mona Lisa smile, mischievous glint in his eyes and utter charm and warmth by being both meek and, well, wild.",False
10,6,Perhaps a bit too sentimental,Jack_1515,n/a,15/08/2025,"A loving tribute to Gene Wilder, but perhaps a bit too loving. Not mentioned are his first two marriages, his broken relationship with his adopted daughter Katherine - who is not mentioned at all. Terri Garr, who co-starred with him in Young Frankenstein, briefly dated him, and who has been critical of Wilder's behavior at the time is noticeably absent.The best and most welcomed parts of the documentary are the coverage of Wilder's early years. Rare photographs, interviews, and audio from the man himself provide depth. Peter Ostrum who played Charlie in Willy Wonka and the Choclate Factory is a welcomed sight and provides great insight into Wilder's performance and technique as an actor.Nevertheless, the film, while mentioning Wilder's movies, generally is uncritical of them, particularly his later films. The only negative thing they say is noting Willy Wonka lost money.As Julie Nimoy is one of the executive producers this approach reminds me of the treatment of her father's first marriage in ""Remembering Leonard Nimoy,"" which she also co-executive produced. Nimoy's divorce gets about 10 seconds of coverage -literally.A good film, but some noticeable omissions.",False
11,10,A wonderful exploration into a comedic genius,connorcohenmarketing,n/a,15/08/2025,"A wonderful telling of the actor and comedian's life story. The movie showcases key moments in Gene's life and career. The movie handles his memory with such care and compassion. You can tell a lot of love went into this project and that they loved Gene and his work. The writer and director showcase a loving tribute to the late actor. The movie really made you feel like you were a friend of the comedian. Whether it was the personal or professional stories, they all showcased a truly remarkable man. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is a fan of the actor and his works. I would also recommend this to fans of documentaries as well!",False
12,7,"Gene Wilder Propaganda, But That's Okay",TheFearmakers,n/a,15/08/2025,"The fact that Gene Wilder narrated this documentary about himself... after his death... taken from his autobiography's audiobook... is both really good and sometimes, not so perfect...However the first outvotes the latter since Gene's journey from the stage to screen... from Willy Wonka to his movies with Mel Brooks to his partnership with Richard Pryor and then his marriage to Gilda Radner... is as optimistic and kindhearted as the characters he portrayed, and how he obviously was in real life: A life of making people (first his sickly mother) laugh...The downside is that the timeless hits like Blazing Saddles and Stir Crazy and Young Frankenstein and flawed misses like Hanky Panky and The World's Greatest Lover and outright turkeys like Haunted Honeymoon and Another You are either treated equally with the classics, or not mentioned at all...So we never really get to experience whatever roadblocks he had along the way (Gilda's death aside), which can often be more interesting than the nice stuff (and it makes any comeback actually matter)... especially in a documentary about an actor with such a long and varied career full of so many ups and downs...But for a bright sunny glimpse into a man of pure cinematic genius, Remembering Gene Wilder is a neat way to spend 90-minutes.",False
13,5,Remembering Gene Wilder,henry8-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"Clearly a tribute to Wilder rather than an out and out warts and all documentary about the man. This is an interesting birth to death picture of the great comic actor delivered through clips, praise from friends and colleagues, including Mel Brooks, who clearly loved him and from the man himself.It is a little rose tinted with never a mention of some of the less than great films he did. Nevertheless he still comes across as a really nice, gentle and just slightly mysterious character who put in some of cinema's greatest comic creations, notably working with Brooks on The Producers, Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. He also clearly had a rough ride later in life and indeed the last 10 minutes where his wife and friends reflect on the times before his death are quite sad and touching. Not a great documentary then, but a fitting tribute to a great comedian and a nice feller. Despite his many great comic turns, my favourite role of his, like that of his pal Harry Connick, is probably Willy Wonka - to me he was and ever will be Willy Wonka.",False
14,10,WILDER IS GENTLE...!,masonfisk,n/a,15/08/2025,"A wonderful documentary on probably the gentlest human beings ever to become a movie star. Tracing his roots as a stage performer from the Midwest, he managed to impress none other than Mel Brooks since he was starring on Broadway in a production w/his wife, Anne Bancroft & he needed to fill a part in a script that he was writing which would become The Producers. And from there you could pretty much say the rest was history as roles in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, Blazing Saddles (in a part Oscar winner Gig Young had to dismiss himself from due to his heavy drinking) & Young Frankenstein (which he co-wrote) & a partnership w/Richard Pryor through a series of comedies (Stir Crazy, Silver Streak & a couple of others) would solidify his legend. On the personal front he'd eventually find love w/fellow comedienne Gilda Radner but after her death from cancer, Wilder was lost until he partnered w/a hearing impaired therapist named Karen Boyer who he'd be w/for the rest of his life. Through all the talking head testimonials & interviews w/Wilder himself, we appreciate even now how much he gave us & how cherished we were to know him even though a celluloid screen would keep him & us apart.",False
15,10,Most emotional I've been,callielopez-81037,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is by far the best documentary I've seen in my entire life. I laughed, mourned, cried and smiled. This documentary has everything that'll you need if you're a Gene Wilder fan or someone who is discovering him for the first time. It showcases his early works from the producers, willy wonka, blazing saddles, all the way to his later works. This documentary seems to go by so quickly since it makes you so immersed. Everytime I've watched it, it really felt like watching it for the first time. An amazing love letter to Gene Wilder and his work. Truly one of the greats and he's dearly, utterly missed.",True
16,10,Remembering a Great Guy,broggoethe,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a great guy. Extremely talented. What makes a terrific documentary. I have an affinity towards liking the actor Gene Wilder so I had to see this one. Shortly after he started his career in acting he changed his name as he wanted to be ""wilder"". From beginning to end I had a huge smile on my face...very rarely does a film do that for me. Mel Brooks who misses his special friend dearly, offers wonderful stories and anecdotes on how the two met and what it was like to watch the genius work in his films. What a great combination, Wilder and Brooks. I didn't know Gene had a second wife after Gilda Radner passed away. They seemed to be another perfect match.",False
17,8,gene wilder's amazing life,ksf-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gene wilder.. who was much wilder. And willing to do anything. Blazing saddles, his films with his hilarious, amazing wife gilda radner. The producers. Gene had been in a show with anne bancroft, mel brooks' wife. And that was just the beginning of his partnership with brooks. Unpredictable, silly, bigger than life willy wonka. Then a bizarre film with woody allen. Young frankenstein, with the perfect cast. Then a whole bunch of great comedies... sherlock holmes' smarter brother, world's greatest lover, hanky panky, woman in red. All so funny. Some with the gilda! What a contribution he made. Great stuff. And well done. Interviews with family, friends, and co-stars. Lots of input from the incredible mel brooks. Directed by ron frank. He has won tons of film fest awards! Really good film of wilder's accomplishments and career.",False

1,9,Incredible,1Redwood1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Louis becomes witness to the hidden depravity, violence, oppression and inhumanity Palestinians face on a daily basis at the hand of 'The Settlers'. This is a brave, must-see documentary that lays bare the brutal reality of settler violence in the West Bank. Theroux's bold, confrontational style-especially when challenging figures like Daniella Weiss-exposes the raw aggression, sociopathy and systemic injustice Palestinians endure daily. The film's unflinching focus on the occupation's human toll, from stolen land to constant fear, is both heartbreaking and galvanizing, earning it high praise for its nuance and courage. Yet, it falls short by not amplifying Palestinian voices enough; settlers often dominate the narrative, and deeper historical context is missed. Still, The Settlers is a powerful wake-up call, demanding viewers confront the truth of Palestinian suffering. It's not perfect, but its impact is undeniable.",False
2,8,Telling it as it is,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's hard to characterise Israel's activities in the West Bank as anything other than settler colonialism; and the sort of person attracted to that life is unlikely to seem very appealing to anyone else. Louis Theroux, in many of his other documentaries, plays perplexed when talking to problematic people; in 'The Settlers', he doesn't hide his palpable dislike of those making facts on the ground at the end of a gun. While one can sympathise with Jews born in Israel, who bear no personal responsibility for the world's complex history but who nonetheless face its consequences, Theroux's interviewees here are a nasty bunch, as the Palestinians who live around them find their own lives steadily squeezed into ever narrower spaces. As usual on this subject, it's hard to see any quick path to an equitable resolution; but important nonethless that the truth be told.",False
3,8,A good film about the development of Israel.,Mika_US,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film ""Louis Theroux: The Settlers"" left a very strong impression. Louis Theroux, as always, masterfully and objectively shows a complex and multi-layered reality. This documentary is not just a story about settlers, but a deep look at the historical and political processes that accompany the development of modern Israel.Particularly valuable is how the film emphasizes Israel's desire for security and stability in the face of the constant threat of terrorism. Through the prism of interviews and personal stories, one can see how difficult and sometimes dramatic the struggle for the right to exist and develop the state is.I recommend watching it to anyone interested in history, politics and who wants to better understand the realities of the Middle East. The film leaves behind a sense of concern, respect for the people of Israel and an awareness of the high price the country pays for its future.",False
4,10,Louis' finest hour,Unfairground2024,n/a,16/08/2025,"A masterpiece in revealing what it means to be a settler in the occupied West Bank, delivered with excellence from a storied documentarian.For those unfamiliar with the geopolitics of the region, Louis meets some of the leading figures in the Israeli settler community gleefully explaining their actions that contravene international law.Louis' understated style allows interviewees to tell on themselves and bring everything to the table with ease.History will look upon this work as a light into the depraved ideology that is beset upon the people of Palestine.If Louis' work needed a crowning jewel, this is it.",False
5,10,First Class,steven_paul05,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent work from Louie yet again, it shows what a lot of people would not know about. It is hard to watch at times due to the mind boggling brainwashed people that he interviews, they really are delusional, however Louie remains neutral like the professional he is whilst speaking with them. He made some humorous comments throughout the programme which lightened the mood on the hard hitting documentary.It is a must watch for a better understanding of what's going on, what you will see is definitely not what you would see on our news stations. Get behind it and spread the word.I'm surprised the BBC aired it, as it is definitely not on side with their agenda.",False
6,10,Essential Viewing,SinthujaV-9,n/a,16/08/2025,Outstanding documentary. Louis and team - thank you. This is so needed at this time. Very disturbing ideology captured so rawly and allowing people to express their ridiculous views without interruption and dig holes for themselves.His interview style is always a hit. I have no idea how he composes himself amongst religious fanatics. But it allows us insight into what these people are telling themselves.Many people might claim this documentary is biased - I would challenge that narrative and ask people to read up on history. Please watch this before we lose it. This is the type of journalism this world so desperately needs.,False
7,n/a,"Tension, power and reality",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Louis Theroux's The Settlers is a thought-provoking and intense documentary that explores life in the West Bank.It offers a close look at the realities on the ground, highlighting the tensions between settlers and Palestinians without forcing a specific viewpoint. Theroux's calm, observant approach allows the situation to unfold naturally, letting viewers form their own impressions.The documentary touches on sensitive issues like settlement expansion, military presence, and restricted movement in a way that feels both emotional and restrained.It's a raw, important watch for anyone interested in understanding the complexity of the region today.",False
8,10,Great balanced reporting,caitrionastaunton,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great, balanced reporting of this conflict. In the face of incredible evidence, Louis Theroux and his team maintains impeccable ethics, standards and overall composure amid obvious conflict and multiple tests of character in a land so consumed with tension. I would elaborate on examples, but it's better to watch for yourself to understand the emotion on both sides and the reasons why such conflict emerges.I would recommend this documentary to anyone open to understanding more about, not just this conflict, but the dynamics that lead this to be the source of so many of the worlds conflicts today.",False
9,10,This shoud not be deleted form Internet,miyadm-87301,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler**""Louis Theroux's *The Settlers* is another masterclass in empathetic yet probing documentary-making. By returning to the West Bank after 14 years, he captures how the settler community has grown-not just in numbers, but in ideological fervor. Theroux's strength lies in letting people reveal themselves: a settler's unwavering conviction, a Palestinian's quiet resilience, or the surreal tension in between.The film doesn't offer easy answers (rightfully so), but it humanizes a conflict often reduced to slogans. That said, I'd have loved even more historical context on land disputes or voices from younger generations on both sides. Still, Theroux's awkward charm and refusal to judge make this essential viewing for anyone trying to understand the occupation's human dimension.""**",True
10,10,Injustice doesn't begin to describe it.,seif-61,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLouis Theroux's The Settlers is a raw, unflinching dive into one of the most volatile conflicts on Earth: the illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank. With his signature calm, unassuming presence, Theroux walks through a landscape where colonization is dressed up in religious zealotry, and apartheid is normalized under the guise of divine destiny and ""security concerns"", excusing hateful behavior rooted in fear and the dehumanization of the Palestinian people.The documentary is a grim look into the injustice Palestinians face daily and how settlers justify it. It isn't loud or preachy and it doesn't need to be. It doesn't scream who is in the right and who is in the wrong. It lets the viewer figure it out for themselves. You hear ultra-nationalists call Palestinians ""savages"", while Palestinians endure daily harassment, home raids, and brutality from the IDF. Meanwhile, Israeli settlers throw parties to celebrate their expansionist agenda, living without consequence of their crimes simply because of their Israeli Jewish identity, while Palestinians face checkpoints, surveillance, humiliation, violence and a constant fear of death just to survive on the land they were born and raised in. The contrast is staggering. Having to go all the way around the city to get back home because a certain part of the city is occupied by Israelis, is both humiliating and dehumanizing, whilst they didn't mind Louis being in that part of the city they clearly minded the Palestinian being there.The normalization of this cruelty is sickening. Watching people justify land theft and violence through cherry-picked scripture is infuriating and eye-opening. It shows how people not only accept injustice when it benefits them but proudly keep it going.What makes this film hit so hard isn't just the facts. It's the vibe. Theroux's awkward, empathetic, common-sense questioning quietly exposes the fanaticism, privilege, and double standards without needing to editorialize. He doesn't have to say Israel is a fascist state. Its own citizens show you, proudly. And amidst it all is the quiet grief of the Palestinian people. So used to this violence, yet still continuing with grace, strength, and a relentless will to live in their rightful homeland.Theroux doesn't demonize anyone. They do it themselves. This is what modern apartheid looks like. Settler colonialism wrapped in faith, nationalism, and bureaucracy, all to justify treating an entire population like a threat on their own land.The Settlers is calm, composed, and damning. If you have even an ounce of compassion, it will leave you disturbed, disgusted, and wide awake to the truth.Everyone should watch this.Rating: 10/10.",True
11,10,Exceptional,skkshoaib,n/a,16/08/2025,"Louis Theroux delivers a quiet but devastating look at Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Through calm, persistent questioning, he exposes the fanaticism, state protection, and apartheid-like conditions driving the occupation-without ever needing to raise his voice.Theroux's strength is letting people reveal themselves. Settlers speak openly about their religious and political motives, and the absence of judgment makes their extremism hit harder. The contrast between armed settlers and vulnerable Palestinians speaks volumes.This is a disturbing, essential documentary-one of Theroux's most powerful.",False
12,5,Nothing New is Uncovered,Silicone54,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was it? He merely went to check out the settlers and tried to coax a reasonable perspective from them. Dude, you are not a diplomat, emissary or ambassador why bother trying. Those peoples have been brewing for war and treating each other as savages which is the necessary evil. You don't shoot your loved ones or friends.I thought this was about the settlers themselves. How they got to Israel, who funded them, the politics among the groups, family life etc. This was just another attempt to paint a picture one side one way and the other side another. Multiple mentions of October 7 yet not one interview from either settlers or the Palestinians? The lightning rod event that touched off the latest war is never discussed?I am for neither side, no skin in the game and I want peace. This doc could have been aired in 88, 98, 2008 etc nothing ever changes. Pointless to make a film we've seen 100 times.",False
13,10,Amazing fly on the wall experience,drsvxo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely fascinating, genuinely..
My whole life I've heard about ideologies and how they move people, I was immensely surprised to watch events happen in front of me.Banality of evil.You watch how people believe that certain human beings are a lower form of life, that they do not even deserve it.Then the philosophical question of ""what is peace?"" To the individuals in question, that is a hard egg to crack.I was also fascinated with onlookers on a destroyed ravaged open air prison/grotto.They actually take their children to watch destroyed homes... And I felt odd, because why would I bring my own child to watch where people have ceased to exit...Actually, it also scared me.. I mean I live in a secure region but what if this happens to me? Woah.",False
14,10,Excellent !,theanolianidou,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Settlers is a documentary truly worth watching. Theroux reports on the illegal settlements in the West Bank through filming and interviewing Israeli settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank. The film provides great insight into the everyday reality of the Palestinians in the West Bank. It also reports the reasoning and ambitions of the Israeli settlers, their enablers and their supporters. Theroux also provides a historical perspective, which helps form a more complete picture of what is being reported. Overall, Theroux's work is very professional and serves as an example of excellent journalism.",False
15,10,Truth,fdgn-111,n/a,16/08/2025,"Certainly! Here's a more descriptive version:It's important to acknowledge a harsh reality: some individuals and groups embody true radicalism and terrorism. These are people driven by extreme ideologies who actively seek to cause harm to others, often motivated by a desire for power, control, or revenge. Unlike those who genuinely strive for peace, these radicals reject dialogue and understanding, instead resorting to violence as a means to achieve their goals. They pose a significant threat to global harmony and security, making it essential to recognize and address this issue....,,,,,,,,,,,",False
16,3,A little one-sided for journalism?,Starskream,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn my ordinary person world journalism is a pursuit of delivering truth to the masses. This documentary is selective in its reporting with tough questions only directed to one side, smug behavior of the lead journalist towards only one side, at times somewhat provocative behavior towards military personnel, implications of superfluous carrying of weapons and at one low point feigned perplexion at the idea of defending oneself from immediate physical violence. Israel in my humble opinion deserves criticism for many things, and one guard he met during his visit acted too emotionally when instructing not to record a military post, but this documentary is not very objective and should probably be seen as activist media. With that said, it was a fairly interesting watch and gave insight into the politically most radical parts of Israel as well as the political aspirations of this Louis Theroux with regards to Israel-Palestine.",True

1,8,Breathtaking documentary about the beauty of hummingbirds,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.I am not familiar with the essence of hummingbirds but filmmaker Sally Aitken does a great job on presenting the beauty of hummingbirds and the personal experiences with Terry Masear who saves hummingbirds. This documentary provides really good themes, concepts and ideas about the living of hummingbirds, what makes them so interesting, and Masear's experience of seeing the hummingbirds population, growth and fragility.There are some beautiful visual presentations throughout and beautiful shots of the hummingbirds. Including some insightful discussions from Masear and other peers throughout. Watching this made me learn a lot about hummingbirds and I actually felt bad for hummingbirds and wanting many of them to have good lives and futures.Really, it's a beautiful story.",False
2,8,A lovely surprise,flynnking,n/a,16/08/2025,"Touching, educational, and possesses an insight on a deeper, universal level then one would expect from a topic that starts, quite literally, from something tiny and specific.Over the course of one season in the hills of Los Angeles, Terry Masear takes you on a layered journey examining the lives, struggles, successes, and failures of hummingbirds, her own life, and ultimately the lives of all living things.The entirety of the film is beautifully shot, the story is well-told, and unfolds in an increasingly complex and meaningful way.Anyone with a love for nature, an admiration for personal struggle and growth, and an appreciation of the beauty that can come from both should give this film a watch.",False

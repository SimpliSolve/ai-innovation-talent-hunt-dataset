1,1,Average Life Expectancy of A Pro Body Builder: 47.5,KingAssmar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, that is roughly 20 years younger than the average US male. These people refuse to listen to trained, educated, professional doctors and healthcare professionals simply because that doesn't fit in with their desire to be competitive. The data clearly indicates that casual bodybuilders who do not abuse these substances actually live better, healthier, longer lives than average, but once one introduces these chemicals into their bodies, their life expectancy plummets. Please keep this type of propaganda away from our impressionable youth.",False
2,1,Shouldn't Be Shown,ieohmingpeijj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Honestly, I try to be opened minded but I just know some people will think this is a way to become physically more attractive and believe the garbage. I've given it one star because I really don't want to see people mess their body up and potentially their life. I find this damaging and though we have a society in which there seems to be little regard as to what is seen or read or listened to, this is one I wish were banned simply because I worry for those who who might be damaged by it. In a way perhaps one might see it an eye-opener as to how stupid we can be and see it as such, yet some will see it as a positive thing and it's those we should care about",False

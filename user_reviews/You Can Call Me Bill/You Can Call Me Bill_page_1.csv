1,7,A preemptive eulogy of sorts,joker-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"William Shatner - he likes to be called Bill - has had an accomplished career. One where he has reinvented himself several times over transforming from Kirk to Hooker to Crane. From author to spokesman to astronaut to ...singer (and no, you do not need to imbibe on Romulan ale to enjoy his rocking ""Common People"" single from 2004). If anyone deserves a curtain call, Bill Shatner gets my vote. The documentary You Can Call Me Bill is a partial answer to such a victory lap. For over 90 minutes, Bill reminisces, waxes poetic, and frets on the future. Sometimes simultaneously. Often in a stream of consciousness. However, if You Can Call Me Bill is designed as a celebration, why does it come across as aimless as your grandfather commiserating about current events over Thanksgiving dinner?Albeit a grandfather who happens to be Captain Kirk.You Can Call Me Bill becomes a preemptive eulogy of sorts. For Shatner fans of all sizes, the movie is accessible and entertaining. Yet all of that humor, all of that love of life are only shown in the clips that the world has already enjoyed and celebrated. You Can Call Me Bill instead focuses on the solitary life of a solo man. Sitting in the dark. Waiting for the final curtain to close.",False
2,7,Plenty To Satisfy,stevendbeard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI saw You Can Call Me Bill, starring William Shatner-Boston Legal_tv, T. J. Hooker_tv.This is a documentary about the life of William Shatner. It consists of interviews and clips of his appearances in tv shows, movies and even his recent space trip, in his 90's-he just turned 93. If you are a fan of him and his work, you will find plenty to satisfy you. Clips are shown from Star Trek, T. J. Hooker, Boston Legal, his Twilight Zone episodes, old westerns.....well, just about everything he has been in. It covers his philosophies on life, such as his love of animals-dogs and horses are his favorite-and basically, the whole planet and the eco system. He talks about how he wants to be buried and it's probably not how you think. The only problem I had was that things are not told in order. He will talk about a show or movie and then jump back to when he was a kid. It's like that through out the movie.It's rated PG-13 for language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes.Like I said, it's for his fans so if you are one, then it would be a good one to stream.",True
3,10,Such a great surprise!,RMK2023,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have always loved and appreciated William Shatner, and looked forward to this documentary. But both my daughter and I were pleasantly surprised at the format - not quite the regular old documentary one would expect, but better!Rather, it's an intimate interview with the legend, who is more concerned with the health of our planet, and the legacy we are leaving to our descendants than to a fleeting fame for his roles - none of which beyond Star Trek my daughter knew anything about.While he is immensely grateful for his career, his outlook on life is quite humbling and deeply introspective, which I feel most celebrities could benefit from. While human and obviously appreciative of his fan-base, he has managed to keep his ego in check and his humor is spot-on!I thought I knew everything about the man, and yet I learned two things that were a total surprise.I won't give them away, you'll have to see the film for yourself. But I will say this - at 93, he has it figured out - and I won't give that away either! I am thrilled to have shared this planet with him!Thanks Bill - and for reference, my 35 year old daughter is a minimal Star Trek Fan, (TOS only), and even less of a Star Wars fan; sci-fi is not her thing. So while she knew very little about you, and only came along to give me company, this film left a lasting impression on her which we are still discussing today! It truly uplifted her!In closing, if William Shatner humbly suggests that he has not changed the world, I would strongly disagree - as he calls himself simply an entertainer - I can argue that great entertainers are as crucial to our world as are the great scientists and all the rest.",False
4,10,Penetrating View of William Shatner's Life and Thoughts,tomhaybauer,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love the original series of Star Trek. It is without question my favorite TV show. I have been to Star Trek conventions and watched the episodes countless times. And yes, not all the episodes are great or even good, but many are truly amazing in both their time and ours. Many very talented people worked on the show, but I think two contributors really set the tone: Gene Roddenberry for his vision, and William Shatner for his commanding presence -- he WAS the Captain of the Enterprise.All this being said, this movie has little to do with Star Trek, and everything to do with an amazing actor who is just entering his 93rd year. Happy birthday Bill! Yes, there are clips from Star Trek and many of his other roles, and yes it's true that this documentary is not presented in a conventional, linear fashion. But what really springs to life is the thinking and the spirituality of a man who cares deeply for his planet and all the life on it. And what could be truer to Star Trek than that?",False
5,4,So So Boring,Mr_Don_Rickles,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're looking for a documentary about the great life of William Shatner this isn't it. I was hoping for a real documentary that would cover his early life, his acting breaks, early TV roles, Star Trek, his marriages etc. But nothing of that is covered. Instead we get a LOT of boring ecological statements that will be forgotten a second after you hear them. I wanted to hear about his relationship with Leonard Nimoy, Gene Roddenberry and the other ST castmates. Again none of that is covered. The one thing in its favor is that they have a lot of wonderful clips from his long career. If you can stream this without paying for it (unlike me), take a look and see if you agree with me.",False
6,10,Very enjoyable,soniamoserporras,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a William Shatner fan, I loved it! You Can Call Me Bill is a great mix of humor and heart. You get to hear his autobiographical commentary and are treated to montages of his work over the years, including rare footage. You even get to experience his music! Even my husband who is not a hardcore William Shatner fan enjoyed it. In this film, Bill is completely genuine and even vulnerable at times. It was a side of him I'd never seen before. Also, the film was surprisingly inspiring with a moving and powerful message about taking care of of our planet. A very worthwhile film about a very interesting man.",False
7,4,Comes across as an old actor rambling for 90 minutes,Dougie B,n/a,16/08/2025,"To be fair, I'm pretty sure it was the editing and directing that made William Shatner comes across as a rambling old man, in the fact that the narrative jumps all over the place. The film is has chapters, but each and every one seems to fall short of telling a coherent story. We get some glimpses into his past, there are some stories that would have been great to learn more about, but instead of details we're left with just his reflections. The film also relies on a bunch of b-roll, some of which is great, but other times is pretty confusing or awkward. Sadly, I walked learning very little about the specifics of Shatner's life and career.",False
8,9,"A message about living life, from the Captain Kirk",sidrea,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched and found the film very moving, a living memorial to someone who has been around all my adult life. And it's wonderful that the guy who this is about is still very active and participating in his own unique way in the modern worldIt's done in the style you would expect from a Shatner type production; which is , like the man himself, slightly off kilter, ruminating about life and death, but with humour and self depreciation. And you do get some great clips but not in the traditional 'the first time I met Leonard.....'type waySo to the reviewer who insults him with his 'rambling old man' review, what did you expect exactly? He is old , but sharper and more human than most. Perhaps Marvel World is better for your viewing pleasure. Cos there's more explosions and stuff!Personally I got the kind of documentary I thought I'd get and thoroughly enjoyed it, with a tear in my eye.",False
9,10,"In a word, profound...",GaryBHaley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, profound. It's high time someone influential in Hollywood championed Earth. But besides adopting the planet, ""Bill"" talks about his career and going into orbit on Blue Origin's New Shepard when he became the oldest human to go into space.The documentary was not a constant barrage of William Shatner shots and film clips, but also some stunning shots of our planet, both from space and redwood forests. Some of the photos and videos are breathtakingly beautiful. Simultaneously exhilarating and calming. The director, Alexandre O. Philippe, obviously knows what he's doing.The one thing that shocked me though, as I thought I knew a lot about Bill, was what happened after Star Trek (the original series) was cancelled. No spoilers here, but, wow. I was shocked.",False
10,9,As one of the investors in this film...,LiquorList,n/a,16/08/2025,"...I give it a solid 9 stars. There were only a few surprises for a die-hard Shatner fan like me, but the joy in watching this film was in the hour and a half, very personal monologue from Shatner. Introspective most times and at other times, filled with humor and anecdotal tales of his past, present and limited future. I would have given this ten stars were it not for Bill coming back to global warming time and again. I have no issues with a person having an opinion, but I'm of the position that once you espouse it, let your audience decide for themselves. No need to harp on it - we get it. Other than that, I enjoyed every moment of the red carpet premiere in Playa Vista.",False

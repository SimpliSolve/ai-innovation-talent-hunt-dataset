2,10,"Inspiring, emotional, breathtaking",marg-24438,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lisa's story and the filming - just mind blowing. Is everything an adventure should have guts, glory and tears. Such a true picture of what Lisa faced and her true inner strength throughout the project. Covers the good and the bad in a way that takes you on her adventure and leaves you wanting to volunteer to help her on her next adventure. Filming is sensational, so many aspects covered including the impact on her family, her team and sponsors. Her work is invaluable and her spirit unique.

5,10,Incredible Ice Maiden Antarctic Sailing Doco,markustrezise,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis incredible documentary showed how courageous, determined and tenacious Lisa was in completing her first Antarctic solo circumnavigation. The story is even more incredible considering how many people said it was not possible and yet she did not give in. She persevered and continued under difficult circumstances from the raising of funds to complete the voyage, weathering storms and boat damage which could have destroyed not only aLisa's shot the record she was seeking, but her Life and boat. It is a gripping and emotional tail told extremely well from start to finish. Highly recommended for all those who love watching real life adventure and stories of someone who can overcome great adversity, to succeed and make the world a better place.",True

A must see film that is gripping, scary, exciting but full of thrills, I loved to see how Lisa Blair overcame all the obstacles, all the setbacks what a fantastic Australian she is.I was on the edge of my seat through most of this film and the craziness of the southern ocean , the scariest of rounding the capes and to come back from the edge of utter defeat it is an extraordinary story, I also loved her stamina and the understanding it gave me of how solo sailing operates, it's really wonderful.",False
8,8,"Sensational Tale of triumph and overcoming terror, facing fear.",daredevil-78989,n/a,16/08/2025,"An amazing story of determination and grit to imagine a dream, support a pathway to becoming a member of that dream and then going out to make it happen.With the embodiment of dogged determination and singular focus Lisa Blair and with the support of all her family set out to make the dream possible. Initially circumnavigating as part of a teamed event, successfully completing all legs of the race. To go on to achieve her master 5 and commercial MED tickets she was a regular skipper of our commercial vessel. The only commercial skipper to always bring back the vessel in better or same condition as when it left.If you have children 14 - 20 years of age, then ICE MAIDEN is not a story just about sailing - it embraces what young people face today - the challenge of the world. While some years back you never faced the wide world at 15 year of age or earlier, today the wild wild world is in their pockets, on their table and in their faces 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.I wounder what strengths we could instill in our next generation if we were to take some of Lisa's dogged determination and inject a force field around our up coming to allow them to ""better cope"" with life and accept there will be challenges, knock backs and reward in life.",False
9,10,Beyond expectation and an award worthy documentary,Julian_R_Bowles,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSimply put, this is what the documentary medium was made for. A gripping true story fully realised through the lens of film and bolstered by a truly awe inspiring production. Please, please, watch Ice Maiden. It reaches the heights of its genre and surpasses them by creating a bevy of inner conversation that will keep this film stuck in your mind long after the credits roll.Lisa is an absolute unit of a human being and her story is as inspiring as it is anxiety inducing, gut wrenching and exhausting. The segments of recreated footage are stunning visually, and have so much impact as a companion piece to the majority of actual self recorded footage. The sound editing is also a massive point of note.",True
10,10,At the edge of the world on the edge of your seat,mockeridgetony,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ice Maiden is far more than a documentary, The film is a visceral experience taking you from the depths of despair and terror to exhilarating highs and sheer relief at survival through seemingly impossible conditions. Action and thriller screenwriters can only dream of taking audiences through this ride that grabs you from the first frame and throws you, almost bodily, into a place beyond imagining. Lisa Blair is a name that should be heard around the globe as one of the greatest adventurers of all time. Whatever you do, if you get the opportunity, see this film. If you're lucky enough to be at the Q n' A sessions afterward, you'll be doubly rewarded. Many films fade from memory - this one definitely won't. It will inspire many with it's simple message...if you have a dream,whatever it may be; work out how to achieve it and get it done. I will certainly be seeing this wonderful film again when it gets it's widely deserved support for international release to cinemas everywhere.",False
11,10,An edge of your seat emotional rollercoaster,susanw-09,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie made me feel like I was on the boat with Lisa, sharing the highs and lows of this amazing achievement.Setting out to make true her dreams and goals, overcoming fear and adversity while being in the middle of the ocean.Having to rely solely on yourself when something goes wrong.Not knowing what every day will bring.Will I have enough 2 minute noodles?This movie had a bit of everything, I cried, laughed, nearly peed my pants a few times
Not many movies can do that
It also teaches us about resilience, mindset and how we are slowly destroying our oceans.How we can all help and do our bit to protect our marine wildlife and the beautiful waters they live in.Congratulations Lisa on an amazing film xx.",False

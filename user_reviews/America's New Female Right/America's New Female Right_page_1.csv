1,4,A wasted opportunity,Mahou5,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary starts in a great place: let's get in their lifes and minds. The fact that the reporter manages to get in the lives of the influencers is amazing. It seems like an awesome oportunity to listen to their crazy ideas in close quarters. And it seems to be put to good use... Until the reporter decides to start pointless discussions about humanity instead of asking deeper questions about their ideas. What's the point? It would have been great to listen the border lady explaining in deep the ""proven fact"" of the organized invasion.The section with the religious family is very good, though.",True

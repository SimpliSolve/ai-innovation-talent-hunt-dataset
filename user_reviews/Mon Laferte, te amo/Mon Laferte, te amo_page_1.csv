1,7,What a life...,jordymadueno,n/a,16/08/2025,"The production lacks structure and rhythm, which makes it quite linear. However, I must say that-putting that aspect aside-I really enjoyed learning more about Mon Laferte's life. It was a complex life with many ups and downs, which gives meaning to her musical style. Moreover, it's always gratifying to discover the story behind the voice, as it adds greater depth to her artistic work. Especially because it allows us to empathize with her, her pain, and her struggles. Perhaps in the future, we'll get a production that pays a better tribute to her life and talent, because I feel like this one was very stingy with her songs.",False
2,10,Great Bio of an Incredible Genius,rorysdad,n/a,16/08/2025,"I expected it to be a bio focused on her music and career, not knowing it was going to be a very personal bio. Half of me is in awe of her surviving and utterly succeeding, both professionally and personally. Half of me thinks, no wonder she's such a creative talented genius...she's suffered and survived like so many great artists. The film was pretty to look at, edited well, and did an impressive job of integrating her music. And I have much gratitude to the filmmakers for making a film about Mon Laferte! She's absolutely incredible on so so many levels, and now I've learned about yet another level. Most underestimated musician on the planet, even with a Netflix special under her belt! And now, rightly or wrongly, I have more respect for Netflix for helping to produce this!",False

1,2,An interesting insight into Christie; her life and books,Janet1612,n/a,16/08/2025,"A nice documentary although we don't really learn anything new. We know of Agatha's disappearance mother had sadly died and husband chooses that time to tell he wants a divorce. This leads to stress and a breakdown, hence her need to getaway. There are so many theories about her disappearance that make great stories, but we know the truth.The interesting Talking Heads tell us of her books and the plots - the nobodies are not worth listening to. Two actresses we've never heard of, one of the acted The Pale Horse, the. Absolutely dire adaptation by the BBC. This actress seems to think ""the settings in The Pale Horse are different to her other books as it's set in London and in the 1960s"". Oh dear, I think she needs to read some Christie novels - Third Girl, Endless Night and a few others are set in the 60s. Also Poirot lives in London - a few are set in London. Please could someone tell her - and in future maybe get someone who knows their stuff.They dig up people who have played in TV adaptations from thirty years ago - although Samantha Bond gets credit for having a mother who put the idea of adapting Miss Marple for TV.If only Samantha's mother was around today - we'd wouldn't have Miss Marple thrown into plots she wasn't in, and we definitely would not have had the ridiculous Pale Horse which is unrecognisable as Agatha's book. How the family in charge of her legacy every allowed these is beyond most fans.Sadly the programme makers missed Parker Pyne - a great book of short stores, also Harley Quinn.",False

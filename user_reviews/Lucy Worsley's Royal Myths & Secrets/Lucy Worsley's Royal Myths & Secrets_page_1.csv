1,9,Superb reveal of how past (and current) historiographers have been propagandists,onepict,n/a,16/08/2025,"I admit as a Scot, and as a retired history teacher and college lecturer, I generally dislike so called historians on every channel over here who really just repeat old propaganda and as a result we ended up with a distorted view of our own history and of course the economic disaster known as Brexit.To my delight, however, Lucy Worsley has single handedly (she is in the minority of English historians) taken on the propaganda and actually presented a fascinating and compelling story of royal history's biggest fibs. She is a superb presenter and takes the time to introduce other historians who tell the really story as it is, or rather was.I really hope this series continues because I can't tell you how refreshing it is to enjoy a history series on television without wincing or groaning (and the occasional yelp). I would have scored a 10 if the episodes were longer and there were more of them...",False
2,n/a,admirable job,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw it as history teacher. And I appreciate the lovely charme of Lucy Worsley, the wise improvisations, the great exploration of anatomy of myths, the care for details and the fair way to propose the truth behind legends.It is an admirable trip across delicate subjects and it is just remarkable the way, not original, but very useful, to modelate the viewer conceptions .So, little more than a very good series.",False

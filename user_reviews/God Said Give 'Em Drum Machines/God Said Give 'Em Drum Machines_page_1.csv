1,10,Best techno doc out there,xtianhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love this film. It totally transports you into the world of techno. My favorite part is the score of the film- that was produced by reggie dokes. Also what a cast of interviews they tapped in with some serious Techno OGS. - Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May, Blake Baxter, Santonio Echols, Eddie Fowlked, The Late Great Mike Huckaby, Egyptian Lover, baby DJ pierre, Art Payne, and Seth Troxler. Their voices gave me a new insight into a genre that i've loved since i was a kid. They review all the circumstances that lead to the origination of Techno through the great migration, motown, Jim Crow, and more. God Said Give Em Drum Machines is the, very necessary Techno Documentary.",False

1,1,One of the most boring comedy specials if not the most boring!,saedaltory-75765,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kountry Wayne: A Woman's Prayer is a disappointing watch, failing to deliver the laughter, wit, and engagement expected from a comedy special. The humor feels stale, relying on tired clich√©s and predictable jokes, while the pacing leaves uncomfortable silences in its wake. The lack of a compelling narrative or theme makes the show feel disjointed, and the production values are unremarkable. I found myself waiting for it to end, making it a forgettable and lackluster addition to the comedy genre. If you're in search of genuine laughter and entertainment, there are certainly better comedy specials out there worth your time.",False
2,1,Meh,maleman97,n/a,16/08/2025,"I did watch this, even though I had low expectations from watching his skits, which are pretty terrible. I mean, he's just not funny. There were no memorable jokes here. I remember great Dave Chappelle jokes. I remember great Richard Pryor jokes. Hell, I remember a great Rosie O'Donnell joke from one of her standups. But hey, congrats to Wayne for finding his niche audience who enjoy those skits because if he actually had to be funny or creative to earn a living, I don't think he'd make it. But he's kinda like Tyler Perry in the sense that even though he's not really good at what he does, he has locked in an audience who loves what he does.",False
3,1,Kountry Wayne=Mid?,erakikilla,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, I loved his social media skits and they would make me laugh until my stomach hurt! With that being said this Netflix special felt forced. His timing was not on point and the crowd engagement wasn't really there. His jokes were sometimes funny but most of it felt forced. Kudos to him for pitting up his own money to film it. I tried to finish the special but could not. However, misinterpreting what another comedian said about you and lashing out like a petulant child, is one of the worst things he could do. Said comedian gave props and disagreed with one thing he said. Trying to flex because you're on Netflix is low hanging fruit.",False
4,1,Not that funny,ngood-85014,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love the social media skits. The comedy special just wasn't that funny. The jokes didn't really hit that way. He was really kind of loud and just not funny. He was all over the place,and didn't do a good job of pulling it all together. Work on the story telling. The suit was nice be he looked hot. I think as he works on his craft he will get a lot better. Watching the skits gave me too great of an expectation. I didn't even watch the whole show. I would like to see far more of his funny skits. Not sure if I will see him when he comes to Detroit. For what the tickets might cost, he just wasn't that funny.",False
5,10,Laughing Nonstop,Beaches700,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed Kountry Wayne's (KW) performance. He was honest, provided great details, and was very funny.KW discussed his personal experiences and his beliefs.He had great facial expressions and was relatable. His storytelling skills are over the top. He really engages the audience with each and every joke.I can only imagine KW producing a family series that allows him to be creative with different characters.He also knew how to engage the audience with his extra facial expressions and body gestures.I'm planning to watch it again because it was absolutely hilarious. I am looking forward to many more opportunities with NETFLIX.",False
6,9,Very funny,kimaj9,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but Kountry Wayne is very funny. This was one of the better comedy special that I've seen in a while. I wasn't familiar with him before this, but I'm excited to see what he puts out next. In the meantime, I'll check out his content on YouTube. He has great energy, physical comedy, and clever materialHe reminds me of Mike Epps, Chris Tucker, and Robin Harris. I think it's great that Netflix is helping to bring comedians to different audiences. I've been introduced to a number of comics through Netflix that I would have never known about. I'll definitely be watching more.",False

1,9,watch it with an open mind,rachelrockrd,n/a,16/08/2025,"A lot of people say it's anti-trump, however all they do is share things the trump administration has done and the effects it's had. so if you think that's anti trump, then idk what to tell you. i don't think this show is trying to convince you to hate trump/ice or to have open borders or let illegals stay, rather show you what really happens to people who come here illegally and legally. it opens your eyes to the very flawed system and how there really is no ""right way"" to enter the u.s. if you don't have connections here. it tries to humanize every side. it's a complicated subject because every case is different and it's not as simple as ""if they came here illegally they get deported."" in fact, it's much more complicated than that. it highlights all the issues with the system in place and the changes that have happened over the years. it's very painful to watch and i cried multiple times. i encourage you to watch it with an open mind and watch every episode.",False
2,8,I don't get the allegations of bias,ConsDemo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had heard this was an anti-ICE series but I didn't get that sense at all. It certainly delved into some controversial policies, but those aren't created by the ICE employees. For the most part, I see ICE agents doing their jobs and in a respectful and diligent manner. Any errant comment can be taken out of context.As for the politicians, the series tries to show all sides, warts and all. Trump and his aides are certainly disingenuous in their about face on family separations. However, the ""Abolish ICE"" crowd comes off as unrealistic. Whatever the agency is called, there is still going to be a need to enforce immigration laws.",False
3,8,Watch all the episodes. It shows both sides,toastthemost,n/a,16/08/2025,"So, this is only out for a few days and these reviews are already bonkers from both sides. I'll try to be objective as this doc-series was on a very divisive issue.I think the biggest takeaway from this series is how our policies and bureaucracy have such a high toll on people in complex situations. It humanized the immigrants. It showed what troubles they face from both legal immigration to undocumented, illegal immigration. Families ripped apart. Decades of life uprooted from where they now call home. A veteran who is here illegally so he can be with his family. It also humanized some of the immigration officers. An ICE agent with a family who empathized with the subject and let them tell their family goodbye. A CBP agent who saved an undocumented border crosser from dehydration and possibly death.For the ""outrage"" that this is liberal propaganda, please just consider that this film is not a Michael Moore piece with some huge narrative. It presents real situations from real people. Most of this was filmed recently, so it shows people affected by the current administration's policies. It didn't only show illegal immigrants either. It showed asylum seekers who were also trying to enter correctly, and what hurdles they faced. However, it also pointed out that the previous administration deported more than any before him, as well as issues with the current immigration laws and policies enacted under Clinton. Episode 6 has a very pro-CBP stance. Shows many of the officers are there to stop human trafficking. Sad to see the true nature of a lot of that is related to organized crime, and it's good that CBP is working on that.",False
4,10,TRUTH FROM BOTH SIDES,bertsworld,n/a,16/08/2025,I LIKE THAT THEY SHOW BOTH SIDES I.C.E AND IMMIGRANT'S...,False
5,10,The TRUTH may be hurt,armandovargas-76927,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDon't let anyone else tel you otherwise. The truth is finally coming out. Ask yourself why did ICE wanted this doc removed? They sued to stop people from seeing what's going on in this great country? Great Doc, keep it up Netflix.",True
6,10,A True Masterpiece as we can expect from Netflix.,axel-863-554567,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before focusing on the content of the series, I think everybody will agree on the slick cinematography and the professional editing of the footage.At times, one would have the impression watching a movie.Only, these are not actors but real people.As far as the subject of the series is concerned, we may all have our different opinions about this.ICE, as an entity, an organisation to track and trace illegal criminals surely has it's legit right of existing, and should not be abolished in my opinion.But when injustice becomes law, it is time to rethink what the priorities are.This is what this series is all about.Regardless of the ""this is my job, this is what I am paid for"" approach from Icers , the bigger moral picture should always remain the compass as to the execution of one's job.This series will create a lot of tremors and a lot of uneasy questions will be asked.I hope that this masterpiece of journalism, will finally result in a ( slightly ) better living environment for all, Immigrants and Ice Officers alike.A Must see.",False
7,10,Wonderful,alezandradavila,n/a,16/08/2025,Loved it it shows woman Latino woman and men in ice . I do think we need to fix some immigration stuff with heart I understand both sides . I think ppl are shocked to know ice agents are 80 percent Latino and minorities . But it's heartbreaking to watch everyone deserves a chance but like I said we need these shows to come up with new legislation for immigrants to come in what I witnessed is if you have a lot of money it's easier to come to USA .,False
8,n/a,Less than 15 minutes into it and had to stop!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,I 'may' try to watch this documentary another time but within the first 15 minutes I was so disgusted I had to stop. What kind of people actually make conscious decisions to do this type of 'work'? I had read that it was a 'fair' depiction of both sides but I didn't see one 'officer' who struck me as anything but horrible. With all that is going on right now probably better to put off watching despicable people carrying out dispicable direction from a dispicable president.,False
9,7,Terrifying but angled vision of illegal immigration,Theaetetus,n/a,16/08/2025,"These six interconnected narratives address the barriers faced by migrants trying to enter the US from Mexico and the efforts of ICE to thwart them. This documentary does not address the larger number of migrants illegally entering the US via airports with tourist visas with no intention of ever returning home. It does not fully address the profits made by US businesses in hiring such migrants in other areas besides agriculture and construction or the abuse of legal guest workers. The film glosses over the effects of economic migration on localities, hospitals, schools, cultural habitudes, linguistic identity, legal migrants, and established minority communities. These factors radically change perspectives on illegal immigration.",False
10,10,Great documentary. Stories from both sides. But it should be easy to pick one.,snattaphol,n/a,16/08/2025,It's very disturbing to see some ICE officers taking pleasures in seeing other human being being separated from their families. I wonder how could they sleep at night. I have no problem seeing people doing their job with prides but these ICE officers are inhuman. No empathy and sympathy at all. What kind of environments they grew up in. I am curious.,False
11,6,I have a heart for Non Violent illegals but this is Anti-Trump propaganda all the way.,rukstar69,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is pretty much an attack on Donald Trumps zero tolerance policy. I'm not defending all the things wrong with this policy or Trump but it's pretty obvious. ICE has been around for a very long time and we never heard much about it under the previous administration. Even thoe that administration deported more people ever in the history of this nation, But now it's a problem. I do understand that under Obama it was higher risk illegal aliens first... And now under Trump it's a zero tolerance policy. I don't think the documentary is terrible , I dislike when they only wanna show one side of the coin... All they want to show you is families getting ripped apart instead of them rounding Up illegal criminals and making us as Americans safer. With all that being said. We do need to do a better job of not separating children from their families. That policy was changed in 2018 I think. We are a nation of laws. We must abide by them. I certainly think a lot can be handled better but these people are just doing their jobs. I hope many people come here and give their kids a better life but let's do it the right way.",False
12,10,Brilliant & Necessary,nniiccoollee,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI feel as if the majority of pro ICE supporters fail to understand that immigrants are HUMANS. This documentary is hard to watch and made me tear up at times due to how shocking the reality of the situation really is. It's a must-watch. The negative reviews showcase a lack of compassion for immigrants and the strength of prejudices above reason.,True
13,7,"So far pretty decent and balanced documentary, but a bit too long",rehensle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finished half of the season so far. Definitely an interesting look back at how recent immigration policies of the Trump administration have effected the lives of current immigrants and the policing tactics of Ice Agents. It's more of an observation of several aspects of immigration enforcement in the new administration rather than having a specific call to action statement.At it's best, the documentary shows that immigration reform not black and white, and that abolishing ICE would not solve the many problems with our existing system. It tries to be pretty balanced politically. For instance, it shows how Immigration policies have been shaped over decades and that Donald Trump's administration is just an acceleration of previous policies from democrat and republican presidencies.The first episode was excellent and grabbed my attention, as it focuses on how ICE agents operate under the new administration, including a lot of ride-along footage with ICE agents. It's pretty eye opening to see how traumatizing it is to be detained by ICE agents and simultaneously offers an interesting perspective from both the ICE agents and detained immigrants. It really shows how the new administration's policies effect everyone involved in immigration.The show does kind of slips a bit after the first episode though. It becomes a bit slower moving because it's more focused on the slow processes that happen after being detained by ICE agents The show follows a lot of Immigrant families which I think is important because it helps humanize the issues. Unfortunately, Netflix falls back on this documentary trope where they ask the families to act out certain conversations to capture on camera. Asking family members to act out conversations just seems kind of corny and ruins the feeling of the documentary's authenticity even if these acted conversations are based on genuine conversations they had in the past. I would have much preffered if they just talked about these topics in an interview-like format, because I feel like the artificial dramatization of their conversations pads out the run time too much.Overall an interesting but imperfect documentary. The first episode is definitely worth checking out, though the rest feels a bit too drawn out.",False
14,4,"""Let's show both si... oh never mind""",elliottbradshaw,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I intially saw this docu-series, I was surprised and excited to see a show about this topic. However, as they delve into the issue, the doc shows how biased it is. They do show both sides, but almost all of it is in favour if illegals staying in the US. Id say 10% shows right leaning, 30% shows left leaning and 60% shows sob stories.They has a real opportunity to objectively show both sides of the argument but failed to do so. Even the talks with the agence themselves show a lot of left learning agents, and all the right leaning ones are typically edited in some moments out of context... such as one agent being like ""Leave the baby out there, they can't come in"", but never explain why... it is likely for security reason as well as avoiding the event where they have to pry a child out of someones arms in order to get the to comply with the officers.There is an argument to be had about the moral aspect of this divisive issue, and I have no issue having it told for people to make their own opinion... However, a lot of nuances about the other side is conveniently left out... for instance the fact that Obama put into motion the seperation of child and parent, but it is framed as if this is a new thing brought on by Trump. There is plenty of other examples too where information is left out, and the audience is mislead to believe something that is not true.The doc aims to make you feel sorry for these people in tough situations, when the reality is, it is them who put themselves AND THEIR FAMILIES in these situations. While I am sympathetic to their situation, I can't help be thing... while, but for your actions, you should have crossed legally. To be fair there are some cases, especially people who have been in the country for decades without ever committing a crime who I personally thing should have the chance to be grandfathered in on a case by case basis. I want to feel sorry for most of these people, but I don't. You can to the US in a manner where you are knowingly breaking the law, and expect to just be let in? Like come on...One thing people fail to consider too, is the fact that illegal immigrants bloat the system and prevent legal immigration who apply properly from being accepted. People have sympathy for these people, but seem to lose their sympathy for the family abroad who are taking the steps to properly enter the US, who will be put on a increasing long waitlist to accommodate people disrespecting the rule and law of the US.More things the doc seems to forgetSexual abuse/rape/trafficking by coyotesA large amount of illegal immigrants have already been deported and have commited crimes in their country or the USMost are young men and not familiesA large amount of the children are with strangers often abducted due to the belief that if you come with a child youll be let inDrugs, firearms being smuggledThe crime rate of undocumented illegal aliensSIN theftTax fraudand much more.Long story short, I wished the series focused less about making you feel sad for these people, and focus more on the system and the agents themselves, while share a more balanced view.Also, noticed all the right wing people asking for both sides of the story, and all the left wing people either cheering for their narrative or angry that there was even an alternative view presented at all... wild.",False
15,10,Unfiltered,DrkLrdBill,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let the ICE agents, the border patrol, the immigration judges, and the sheriffs speak for themselves.If you can watch this whole series and still support the existence of ICE or our immigration courts, then you have no soul. We have federal marshals to conduct arrests on fugitives, and we have a judicial court system that should provide these people due process. What's the harm in a man escaping certain death from his own country and working here, doing a job that none of you would want to do? Why are we deporting veterans for minor drug offenses like marijuana? Veterans are prescribed marijuana in many states for pain and other conditions, yet this guy gets deported for pleading guilty to probation?If this is considered propaganda by Trump supporters, then your brain is broken.",False
16,10,What makes you more worthy to be in America than another human being?,America-3865,n/a,16/08/2025,"To the people reviewing this saying ""they should just come here legally"" you've missed the entire point of this 6 hour documentary. To this statement I will pose a few questions and things to consider.1. There are countries where it's almost impossible to escape legally.
2. The system is extremely backed up and disorganized. Because of this, the process can take months or even decades to be completed.
3. There are human beings from other countries that live in daily fear of the gangs which run their streets, who can't wait for months or years. It is a matter of life and death.
4. I'm completely for deportation of people who commit crimes (I'm not lumping things such as traffic violations into this remark) I'm referring to crimes which can endanger others lives or have already endangered others. Sex crimes, murder, drug trafficking are but a few which fit this criteria. It is immoral to deport someone who is simply trying to seek a safer and better life, and isn't committing a crime other than ""illegally immigrating"" to America. The term ""illegal"" is subjective to what we perceive as human beings as right or wrong.
5. As an American I asked myself this question a while back and I encourage anyone reading this to do the same: What makes you more worthy to be in America than another human being? What makes you different? The only difference is: you happened to be born here. Any of us could have been born anywhere. If you're American, like me, you were LUCKY to be born here. Our government is corrupt. Our systems are broken. But even still our corruption doesn't even compare to what millions of human beings experience in other countries.
6. Put yourself in the shoes of an immigrant. If you were living in a world where public executions were a real thing, gangs roamed your streets. What would you do? You would react naturally as any human being would and you would fight for your life. People walk weeks in a desert, hundreds of miles, knowing at any moment they could die right then and there with their family alongside of them. They are human beings who do this out of desperation. Desperation knowing that this may be their last chance to have any hope of a safe life.
7. American born citizens, big businesses, and US government officials are partially responsible for the corruption of the Mexican government. All of the above have been financially benefiting from the Cartel for decades. Simultaneously we deport immigrants who flee their country to escape the corruption that we helped create.
8. Most Americans would agree that Big Pharma is corrupt and exploits people for financial benefit, yet you don't believe our government is involved with the Cartel? It's already been proven.
9. The tactics used are inhumane and if you look at every bit through a lens without political affiliations, you'll realize that the tactics being executed are disturbingly similar to those used against the Jews by the Nazis.
10. A big argument for why illegal immigrants are bad for the US is because they're taking jobs from Americans and negatively impacting the economy. Most immigrants live in the most impoverished neighborhoods in this country. They purchase things and put money back into the economy. Some of them pay taxes. Some don't. Many are paid below the federal minimum wage. These people work the jobs that most Americans would scoff at. What jobs are being taken from Americans? Because what I see are Now Hiring signs everywhere. Most immigrants don't even have the opportunity to work the jobs that Americans would.
11. I saw a comment on someone's review which said ""if you come in the legal way, you're an idiot for wasting your time and money. You could have just come here illegally for free"". This statement is completely false. In fact, on average it will cost someone 5-8x more to come here illegally. It costs anywhere between $0 to $725 to come here legally. To come here illegally can cost anywhere from $5-10k. The average income in Mexico $843/mth. So if a person paid no bills for 8 months they could afford to come here illegally. On top of that, they have to cross a desert and climb mountains for weeks in temperatures above 100 degrees F. Coming here illegally is far more expensive and dangerous but is typically done out of desperation to escape quickly.Put your politics aside and stop making this about Republicans or Democrats. These are human beings. These are people who feel, laugh, cry, love. These are people who have dreams and want a good education and safety for their children just like you and I. It doesn't matter what things did or didn't look like under a certain administration. Anyone who supports this regardless of political affiliations is morally corrupt in the eyes of most of society. Has it gotten harsher under the Trump administration? Yes. That is a fact. Does that exonerate the Obama administration and anyone else involved? No.Put your HUMANITY before your politics. Stop weaponizing human beings as pawns for your political chess moves. You're exploiting human beings when you do this and it's wrong.Immigration to our country and others can be better regulated and humanely handled. Instead, every country is corrupt and controlled by government officials and agencies which represent a fraction of our populations and tell us where we as human beings are able to exist on a planet that we are all equally a part of. A majority of human beings are being controlled, abused, and exploited by 1% of the human race.To those who wish and hope to come to America for a better, safer, and more prosperous life, I welcome you to our country. I hope that you find your way here safely. May you live a happy and quality life here. You're a human being that is valuable.",False
17,10,A must watch for nations where nationalism and anti immigration policies are on the rise,nadiakebble,n/a,16/08/2025,"While this documentary is based on ICE in the US over a number of years during the trump administration, there are parallels in attitudes that can be seen in policies across the globe in recent years. Other nations need to watch this and recognise our own wrongs in our own policies and law enforcement.This is a documentary that makes you acknowledge law and humanity do not always align.

21,10,Powerful and highly disturbing,JohnM63,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series shows you the personal stories of illegal immigrants in the USA, who are confronted with the effects laws that are being upheld by ICE. The other part is about the personal motivations of ICE officers for doing their work.Without hardly any further comment and merely showing situations, this documentary is a powerful document on how we as a society deal with what's lawfully considered illegal and how we loose perspective on what is morally right and wrong.The story is quite disturbing, and not even just because of the families that fall victim to law enforcement.Most disturbing is that fact hardly any of the ICE officers second guesses the moral legitimacy of their work. Their motivation is nothing else than 'it' s the law and someone has to do it'. This is shocking as it is a strong reminder of the attitude with which many Germans 80 years ago went about when doing their 'work'. For anyone who is only mildly aware of our recent history, this documentary is a strong warning that we should not be complacent. If there's anything to learn from this document, it's that morality should be at the cornerstone of every law and that the way laws are enforced should always be measured in terms of moral rights and wrongs.When children are being separated from their parents, when law leads to raids, when only numbers count, when even US war veterans are declared illegal in their own country because of a minor misdemeanor, then it's time to reconsider the law.Immigration Nation is a powerful and disturbing document in which stories are well told with basic simple means and without anything being overdramatized. Well done.",False

All everyone wants to do is whine about the fact that president Obama had more people deported than take an actual look at the atrocities that are happening. Under president Obama there were mass deportations, true, but they were only for criminals. Under the trump presidency they don't care who get they catch as long as they catch someone. The show doesn't show ICE in a bad light. The ICE agents shows themselves in a bad way by behaving like depraved animals trying to catch something instead of empathetic human beings. The show was a great way to show the reality of so many people. The horrible ways in which they get mistreated. They show how judges don't even have the liberty to make real decisions without risking losing their jobs. It shows the true bias there is.",False
24,5,From a Border Patrol Agent,trevjsmith-16701,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI would like to give a comment as a Border Patrol Agent. I will only speak to episode 6 because that is the only situations I'm throughly familiar with. The first half of the episode does a good job of telling the facts. But after the Bill Clinton speech the nartive of the documentary becomes clear that they support illegal immigration. This is showen in a few ways.-Prominently showing agents that have the same or similar views as the narrative. And only showing short clips from ones that don't.-At the end especially, editing parts of conversations and parts of sentences that are clearly unrelated and taken out of context to make a point.-Failing to tell all the facts: for example showing agents kicking and destroying water drops from ""no more deaths"". It is not mentioned that these videos were shot many years before the documentary was shot and policy has been in place for years discouraging such action. And that reports of agents destroying water drops has gone away for years. They also fail to mention the extensive criminal history of ""no more deaths"" and their involvement in smuggling and trafficking.-Displaying hearsay or personal opinion as fact. The last ""statistic"" we hear the medical examiner(at the end) says ""99% of the people would not have died if they could have been vetted and admitted"". Not only is this a misleading personal opinion BUT it is completely untrue. Almost HALF of the people apprehended by the CBP have a criminal history in the United States already (this is not including the possible criminal history in their country of origin) all of which would exclude them from entering the US legally.But the biggest flaw is only showing a fraction of the traffic coming across the border. A quick look at CBPs twitter accounts would show the mass amounts of hard narcotics that are being seized. And that is only what was caught!They talk about smuggling but only show male adults. They:
Fail to show the number of accounts of rape by the cartels and members of smuggling group.
Fail to mention criminal record of anyone crossing.
Fail to mention the sex trafficking that the cartels are engaged in.
Fail to mention the trafficking of children being used as ponds to exploit loops in the system intended for families.Do I think the immigration system needs to be changed? Yes, but it is so complicated there is not a silver bullet that will fix it. But reporting misinformation as fact is not a way to start.",True

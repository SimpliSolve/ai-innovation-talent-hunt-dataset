1,7,Eccentric characters,bt698nhj,n/a,15/08/2025,"Unlike the other two reviewers as I write this, I found this interesting. However, I was not familiar with the story, unlike the other reviewers. I agree we'd like more information, but I think that information we'd like about the details of the heist is confidential. If you don't know the story, I think it's worth a watch. At a minimum, the eccentricity of the characters is interesting.ABOUT MY REVIEWS:I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable.",False
2,5,how in the...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHoly name of Heist, can they make such a dull presentation about something this real big, a billion dollar heist of something you can barely touch nor feel, just a bit of a coin that has become as pure and rare and 1000folds as valuable compared to pure gold , mined in completely seperate ways, its still evil hard to find, unless you have your own hatcing instrument to hack it out...no its a poor storytelling , they biograph the culprits instead of the real heist, which we were promised in the film title...but with so much secrecy , and thorns stuck in the cryptoalliances and / vs the us governments sides, its hard to get every detail about the story about this heist...the grumpy old man ended up viewing at ffwd+1,5, napping of frequently, cause bit coin and other crypto currencies are dull stuff in general so beat this one and wait for the next one, maybe theyll learn...",True
3,5,A Documentary On A Crypto Heist Which Falls Flat,t-d-t-m82,n/a,15/08/2025,Ok so it's a bitcoin film documentary and bitcoin is a digital term of currency and its value is questionable at best. I am not a fan of bitcoin.I'm also confused as of how it is the 'Biggest Heist Ever' when it is clearly not. It's got some nice production and visuals but the characters involved are highly-pretentious and irritating and it's a very flat film.I actually fell asleep 2/3rd's of-the-way-through. It is not entertaining. According to the article from the Independent it was not even the biggest digital heist of all-time.Kids don't get greedy; be honest and work to the best ability you can. This is not the answer.,False
4,4,They are so cringey that I could barely finish the doc,ME8224,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary was interesting but I was so distracted, to the point of disgust, by how cringey and obnoxious the main characters were, Heather especially. I was in horrified awe the whole time and it was genuinely hard to concentrate on the story. I'm just...there are no words. Woof.The doc itself was well done, and everyone featured aside from Heather and Dutch helped build and explain the story. But my God, it's hard to get past the ""rap"" and grating voice and, well, everything.Given all of the above, yes, it is indeed very hard to believe that these two individuals were responsible for any sophisticated events, let alone a large scale heist. But if their morals are as askew as their self awareness, then I do actually see how it could be possible.",False
5,1,Worst presentation of a heist ever,TheTruthofItIs,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Biggest Heist Ever"" (12/6/24, 80-min, Netflix) is yet another hurry-up, poorly done Netflix production. This could've and should've been an awesome, highly anticipated expos√© but instead it's a high-school level examination of Heather's cringe ""RazzleKhan"" alter-ego. Razzle-con anyone? This documentary doesn't even detail the actual heist! Oh, there are allusions to it, there's discussion, but it's all circumstantial. There was no detailing of how they did it, the timeline, you know, normal investigative reporting. Pitiful. And worse, towards the end because no one could believe these two social mutants could scheme to pull this off, is that there's some conjecture that Ilya's father, Eugene, was involved but there's no supporting investigation for it! Candidate for worst documentary of 2024.",False
6,n/a,In this doc they have a spoiler for Red Dead Redemption 2,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was relatively okay, but in one of the interviews they discuss the ending of Red Dead Redemption 2 ... a huge spoiler! ... with absolutely no spoiler alert. I was about to start playing that game. Immense rage fills me as a result, and so I warn anyone who is considering watching this, proceed at your own risk. But I would say this mediocre documentary is not worth the spoiler.I didn't meet the minimum character amount for a review so I will just repeat twice ...
This documentary contains Red Dead Redemption 2 spoiler.This documentary contains Red Dead Redemption 2 spoiler.For emphasis and minimum character requirements.",False
7,8,The Heist That Redefined Audacity,KirtiWAnand,n/a,15/08/2025,"Forget bank vaults; this was a cyber heist executed with Hollywood-level precision:AI-powered hacking that bypassed ""unbreakable"" firewallsInside operatives who exploited blind spots in securityA global money maze that left investigators chasing ghostsThe thieves' genius exit strategy involving:Cryptocurrency dead dropsFake identities crafted by deepfake techA trail that literally vanished into the dark webHow Interpol and ethical hackers raced against time as the stolen funds disappeared in real-timeChilling Quote:

8,2,You Won't Learn Anything You Didn't Learn From a Newspaper Article,patrinamcbride,n/a,15/08/2025,"Seriously though, you don't learn ANYTHING beyond some character back story. Not how they did it, not of they had outside help from foreign countries, no intrigue, nothing. The big fbi/cia guys who actually put the whole thing together & made the arrest are like cardboard; no personality, no excitement; dry as toast. Even the ""friends"" & coworkers know nothing about them, no juicy tidbits. All relationships were superficial at best. The subjects weren't shown to have lived a ridiculously lavish wasteful life. The producers & directors stole 90min of my life to say yep, they plead guilty. Don't waste your time.",False

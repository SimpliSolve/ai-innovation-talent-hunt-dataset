1,9,Well Done,jimcisneros,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thought this documentary was well done. I've seen many on Elvis and this one was very enjoyable and not over the top! Most of the other reviewers seem to have felt the same way! However, there's always that one that has to somehow make it political (see his heading usual suspects) which is ridiculous! I thought all the cameos were excellent! I especially liked Darlene Love's insight! Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm definitely not a big fan of Conan but he was really good in this and made some very good points from an entertainers view! I would definitely recommend this documentary to any Elvis fan! üëç",False
2,7,Very Good Documentary,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a a very good documentary of Elvis Presley. It is centered around his 1968 Comeback Special. The film is a sort of companion piece to the highly successful Baz Luhrmann film. Baz is heavily interviewed together with the Priscilla Presley. There is more here than the 1968 Comeback- the main part of the story is what lead to the need for the Comeback at all. That was a series of monetarily momentous, yet culturally disastrous decisions by his Manager, Col. Tom Parker. The footage is great. The music is great. The film is not too long. I highly recommend this for Elvis fans, or for people not too familiar.",False
3,8,Legendary,Kingslaay,n/a,15/08/2025,"A great documentary about the King that showcased the incredible talent and charisma Elvis had. It documents how Elvis's meteoric rise to fame was followed by formulaic movies that were about making as much money as possible. It was sad to see Elvis reduced to mindless entertainer doing anything for money. The 68 Comeback special is so iconic because it showed his fightback and talent he wanted to share with the world. It showcased old and present day Elvis where for a moment he took control of his destiny and journey. It is unforgivable what Colonel Parker did to Elvis and tragic how this great figure became a prisoner of his fame and his manager. After this comeback and revival, the King would live for less than a decade. He was a work of art and had incredible talent. I only wish they showcased a little more backstage footage of the special for the King.",False
4,10,gives new life to an event few understood,A_Different_Drummer,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gives new life to an incredible story. But does not do justice to his fascination with religion. Elvis used to carry a Bible with him everwhere, and he would ask friends to open to a page at random, pick a verse, and he would complete the verse from memory. In my IMDb comment on the original ELVIS THE COMBACK SPECIAL (1968) -- on my IMDb list of best all-time films -- I suggested that, decades from now, historians looking back at our present time period will note that, of the many dozens of Conspiracy Theories floating around, the Bob Joyce controversy was the only one that could actually produce a smile. The world is a brighter place with him still in it. Do your own research. Start with ""Clark Kent Syndrome."" ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

5,10,Absolutely loved it,Basicpleasuremodel,n/a,15/08/2025,"You forget, or at least I did, just the incredible talent Elvis had. You can hear it in his music but as one commentator reflected, it's a whole other level when you 'see it'. This documentary smartly gives a reprisal of his career (not long, that's been done and done), how it went wrong but focuses on how this special helped him find his way back. I was very touched by the outtakes, showing his nervousness making the special. A lot of the footage I had not seen before so that was interesting. Although Elvis looked like a god (truly beautiful man), he wasn't arrogant or entitled, he had charisma. He had that in spades, and you just don't see that anymore in my opinion. The documentary does well to have various legends like Springsteen and the late Robbie Robertson talk about that sheer talent and influence. What I liked even more was the friends and back singers interviews, Conan Obrien and of course Priscilla Presley. I think this is definitely worth the watch. Netflix has had some misses, this is definitely a home run!",False
6,7,VIEWS ON FILM review of Return of the King: The Fall and Rise of Elvis Presley,burlesonjesse5,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler2024's Return of the King: The Fall and Rise of Elvis Presley is a documentary about Elvis and his eventual, alley-like return to the musical ring circa 1968. ""Nobody messes with the King and nobody ever says he's down."" Indeed.""Fall and Rise"", well it stars the late Elvis Presley of course along with interviews from the people who were there or could get in his head while peeling it off (Priscilla Presley, Billy Corgan, Conan O'Brien, Bruce Springsteen, Jerry Schilling). The flick, yeah it's a tapestry of archives and probes sifted through a breezy 90 minutes as Presley's singing voice melts the airwaves like butter. Heck, he was so darn famous even The Beatles were nervous as all get-out when they eventually met him.So here's the thing, ""Fall and Rise"" is an account about the ""King of Rock and Roll"" that puts the dude in a more approving light. I mean fans of Elvis will be more reminded of the glory days and not the later years, you know, the obese and drug periods that led to Presley passing on that summer day via August of '77. Yup, just picture a less dramatic, more sunny, docu version of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis, complete with swipe about Presley's film career and his awkward relationship with his shady manager, Colonel Tom Parker.Graceland demises and biographical spectacles begot, ""Fall and Rise"" while avoiding the whole fan-made and/or tributed tag, is oddly standard in its chronological approach despite being effectively grainy and redolent. Compared to other stuff like the four-star Tina and/or The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart, it doesn't exactly set the world on fire. Still, Return of the King: The Fall and Rise of Elvis Presley is forthright, exposed, and disarmingly diverting. It goes down better than one of Presley's bygone plates of fried chicken coated with potato chips. Give ""rise"" to.",True
7,10,* * * * * GREATEST SHOWMAN/ENTERTAINER OF ALL TIME * * * * *,paulscudder,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an EXCELLENT Documentary about The Greatest Showman/Entertainer Of All Time. The Documentary tells the Elvis story from the very beginning, and throughout his amazing career as a singer/entertainer, including his many ups, and some downs. His story is told through the people who knew him well. The documentary shows many wonderful photographs of him throughout his colourful career. Showing many clips of him singing lot's of his great songs, many clips of his shows/concerts, his interviews, and personal family/friends footage, though a lot of it on view to the general public, which would follow him around throughout his life, as though he was 'public domain'. I know the many legions of Elvis Fans around the world, including the many hundreds or thousands of Elvis impersonators, who will have seen the many documentaries made of Elvis, to know how this latest documentary compares to the previous one's, and how good they think it is. For me, who has 'Johnny Cash' as my number one singer, and seen a number of Elvis documentaries over the years, find this one my favourite. Really nice to see, and hear Bruce Springsteen talking highly of Elvis. Like me, I do hope you all enjoy this highly rated Elvis documentary. (ps)",False
8,7,HAIL TO THE KING...?,masonfisk,n/a,15/08/2025,"From last year, comes this documentary on Elvis Presley's famous 1968 TV concert which put him back on the map after his popularity was on the wane (his choice of vapid movie vehicles didn't help!). Gathering admirers (Billy Corgan, Bruce Springsteen & Elvis director Baz Luhrman) & surviving participants involved w/the broadcast, we get a sense of where Elvis was at in his career & what the show meant to him & how it'd make him relevant again. If his mentor & manager, Colonel Parker, had his way, the musical performances would've included idiotic segways (to show off how macho he was?) which infuriated the King who just wanted to rock out which from most accounts he did. While focusing on the actual lead up to the presentation, the doc sizzles but whenever it fell back on historical accounts about his career (something 2018's Elvis Presley: The Searcher covered in hefty detail), things seemed to be running in place but other than that for an Elvis completist you can't do much wrong w/this doc.",False
9,10,Return of the King: When Lightning Strikes Twice,tileskil-94657,n/a,15/08/2025,"In an era of perfectly curated social media personas and algorithm-driven stardom, ""Return of the King"" doesn't just reframe Elvis - it holds up a mirror to our own time. Through a masterful reexamination of iconic moments, particularly the raw electricity of the '68 Comeback Special, this documentary doesn't unearth lost footage so much as strip away decades of accumulated mythology to reveal a shocking truth: we've been looking at Elvis through the wrong end of the telescope all along.The film's genius lies in its reconstruction of familiar scenes, most notably from 1968, where we finally understand what we're actually witnessing: not just performances, but prison breaks. When Elvis tears through ""If I Can Dream,"" the camera lingers on moments we've seen before but never truly understood - this isn't just a comeback, it's a man literally breaking free from his chains, if only for a moment. The sweat isn't from the hot lights; it's from the effort of pulling back the curtain on reality itself.Colonel Tom Parker emerges not just as a manager but as an architect of limitation, a master builder of golden cages. Yet what makes this portrayal so haunting isn't its villain, but its relevance - how many Colonel Parkers exist today, their methods refined by technology, their control made absolute by algorithms and analytics?The documentary's most powerful revelation comes in its deconstruction of Elvis's infamous nervousness before performances. These weren't the jitters of an insecure star - they were the tremors of a human vessel preparing to channel something larger than himself. Watch his hands shake before the '68 special, then witness those same hands minutes later commanding the stage with supernatural confidence. This isn't stage fright being conquered; it's transformation being documented.Modern audiences accustomed to seeing their stars as brands will find something both foreign and deeply familiar here. The film speaks our language - it understands our obsession with performance, our worship of excellence, our endless pursuit of the next level. But beneath this familiar framework, it plants a devastating question: what if what we call 'peak performance' is actually just the ceiling we've built over our own heads?The technical achievement in sound restoration serves a higher purpose here - it's not just about clarity, it's about truth. When Elvis breaks through in certain moments, particularly during the '68 special, the audio quality captures something that feels less like music and more like testimony. These aren't just good performances; they're proof of what happens when authentic talent momentarily escapes its constraints.To the casual viewer, this might just seem like another well-made music documentary. To those paying attention, it's a blueprint of both imprisonment and escape, rendered in rhinestones and rebellion. The true genius of this film is how it speaks simultaneously to both audiences - offering surface-level excellence while encoding deeper truths for those ready to receive them.Watch this film. Then watch it again. First time for the spectacle, second time for the spaces between the spectacle. Pay attention to the moments when Elvis isn't performing - or rather, when he stops performing one role and accidentally reveals another. There's a reason these particular performances have resonated through decades, why they feel more real than reality itself. They're not just moments of great entertainment; they're moments when the truth broke through, when authentic expression escaped the machinery built to contain it.This isn't just a documentary about Elvis - it's about every pure impulse that's ever been packaged, every wild talent that's been tamed, every truth that's been transformed into product. But more importantly, it's about how that truth always finds a way to shine through, if only for a moment, if only for those with eyes to see.In an age where authenticity itself has become a marketing strategy, ""Return of the King"" reminds us what the real thing looks like. And once you see it, you can never unsee it again.",False
10,10,The king rides again!,colonel-13070,n/a,15/08/2025,"The story of Elvis is the quintessential triumphant tragedy story. From a truly dirt, poor person to the highest points of stardom and still being held back from even more lightning in a bottle by Colonel Tom Parker, not letting him tour overseas. But I always grab me about the story is that there was no blueprint for anything back then. Certainly they were great singers, actors, etc. But this level of fame was different. For all the different reasons, whether they were good reasons or bad, or somewhere in between Elvis was the chosen one. And he struggled with that for most of his life. I enjoy hearing people giving him reverence for his contributions and his story. It is tragic beyond words how his the Klein affected him and was so rapid. At least he ate the world before they eat him. Incredibly sad. I would give this a nine, but only because I want more. Hopefully they'll be another one of like this covering the Vegas years. I agree with some of the other posters here. This wasn't all that in-depth. There's much more to say by people who were really there. But the Elvis machine keeps feeding the masses because so many of us want it. He was just simply taken too soon and people like me want more. I've never seen an artist be copied by so many tribute artist across the world. It always amazes me to see people putting so much effort and making a career out of it essentially. An amazing man for sure with an amazing story.",False
11,2,The usual suspects,badtweed,n/a,15/08/2025,"Here we go again with a over blown narrative and the use of so called favorite talking heads that repeat info about Elvis that everyone who pays attention already knew. There are plenty of much better videos about Elvis that are worth viewing and don't employ the ""insert hyperbolic drama"" device. Maybe try watching the actual special to see for yourself rather than have to hear these built up media pop stars like Bruce blather on with the same old info. Do we need to keep having Springsteen constantly pop up on our social media screens with his overly opinionated self important self? And why so much focus on Elvis being nervous prior to the show? Many stage performers have stage fright even well into their careers and it hardly diminishes their level of talent. 2 stars for the very limited amount of actual Elvis footage. And boo to the use of random pop culture talking heads that have been paid to read the same old tired info about the King. We just had an election where the loser used and deployed that same technique with a bad outcome.",False
12,10,Opera from Europe,aybigetek-11111,n/a,15/08/2025,"I never knew that he was interested and inspired by the opera. And the timing is being after the army is poetic. Impressed to learn this. The fight with the system is real. I wanna even know more about him now. He is so infinite. Movies maybe hurt him after a while but on the other hand, if he didn't get bored and angry and intimidated he wouldn't be king. All the negative stuff that he fought against made him who he is still even today. Big big man. Thank you cast! Seeing Bruce there talking about Elvis is too cool to be true. Freedom rock and roll gospel opera love and not being abandoned. No worries Elvis! YOU MADE IT MY DEAR :) You wont be abandoned ever! Immortal everyday now! God bless USA.",False
13,10,A top notch Elvis Presley show,rogerdozier,n/a,15/08/2025,Thank you Priscilla Presley and everyone else involved. These new generations need to get up to speed on just how fantastic Elvis was and how influential he still is. I'd like to see a movie like this made about more of he's performances like Aloha from Hawaii and any others that may have not been widely aired. This was great to see and I really hope Priscilla Presley can find more to make like this. It was really special to see the love and admiration she still has for him after all these years. I'm running out of things to keep texting about but I still need more characters lol. This is a definite great watch.,False
14,10,Watch lightning in a bottle strike again!,dorrdeb,n/a,15/08/2025,"The curtain gets pulled back on what we now recognize as a make or break moment in Elvis' career that many, myself included, remember with awestruck clarity. I was completely gobsmacked and mesmerized, unable to take my eyes off him, which is of course, the magic that was Elvis. As one commentator pointed out, Elvis was an experience and the '68 special was a towering example of his talent, raw magnetism, and ability to connect with an audience. As it turns out, this was both a strength and an Achilles heel for him throughout his life. This struggle is explored and serves to humanize him as we get a glimpse of the shy, sensitive man he was. Some important context is provided about this time in his career and personal life, and we hear Elvis' words throughout. Some of his iconic performances from the special are highlighted and remain nothing short of jaw dropping, even all these years later. I particularly appreciated hearing from Baz Luhrmann, Bruce Springsteen, Conan O'Brien, Darlene Love and others, whose understanding of Elvis' unique, never to be seen again, impact on the world is beautifully articulated. I'm all shook up...again.",False
15,10,The rebirthing of Elvis!,michaelRokeefe,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerJason Hehir of The Last Dance fame directs this Netflix documentary that reminds us of the most defining TV hour of Elvis Presley's unequaled career. No stranger to the small screen since those hip-swinging, pelvis thrusting days when he was dangerous to the days of bejeweled white jumpsuits. The 1968 NBC special originally titled ""Singer Presents Elvis"" was a return to live performing in seven years. This was possibly Elvis' last chance to reclaim his throne as the ""King of Rock and Roll"". At this time Presley was not navigating the nation's musical mainstream very well.This special features behind-the-scenes and aired footage of that monumental program filmed in Los Angeles for NBC. Besides outtakes and highlight Elvis performances are current interviews from Presley superfans Conan O'Brien, the late Robbie Robertson, Baz Luhrmann, Bruce Springsteen and Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins. Priscilla Presley provides some golden memories. (She had never seen her husband perform live until that taping of the '68 special.) So inspiring to see the world's most popular entertainer find his freedom and regain his true path of greatness.",True
16,9,Elvis as a human being and as a cultural phenomenal,gtessarini,n/a,15/08/2025,"Whether you are a big fan or someone just starting to learn about Elvis Presley's story, anyone who watches this super production will see facts, reflections and discoveries that are increasingly surprising when we think about the artist's masterpieces, his humanization, personal trajectory, his feelings and their impact on the American entertainment industry (which spread throughout the world).More than that. Anyone who watches this documentary will see how the man's life was partly shaped and even impacted (both positively and negatively) by the captains of industry, and how the paths of Elvis and even society could have been different and more lasting if it weren't for the evil greed of others.When I first read the title, I was displeased with the fact that it insinuated that there was in fact a ""fall"" of Elvis Presley, since to this day his works and actions are admired and arouse strong emotions and projects all over the world. But if you read it carefully, you'll notice that the ""rise"" comes after the ""fall"", showing how he recovered from difficult times and continues to rise in music, movies, art, fashion, business and society.A beautiful, true documentary, with fans, historians, colleagues and relatives who really lived with him and know what happened at the time, as well as artists and professionals today who know how he must have felt, with the empathy that only those who live in the same environment know how this business works.Even as a ""documentary"" with sincere and exciting facts, the production brings action, suspense, lots of energy and intimate views on different moments in the life of the King of Rock, from before he won this title, to the phase of one of his greatest artistic achievements, known as the '68 Comeback Special show (the first musical acoustic recorded and televised) that changed many trajectories, both in Elvis's life and in the lives of several other artists and the public.Those who know the story may feel like something is missing at the end, since even after the shocking ending of the 1968 show (which is the focus of the documentary), Elvis actually continued his career with another 9 years full of innovations and stardom in his Las Vegas phase, show circuits all over the US, new successful films, the first show broadcast via satellite to the entire world and other artistic and personal changes of great value.Since the king's life was relatively short, but full of such great achievements compared to the short time he was physically with the public, there really wouldn't be enough space in this particular production to show all the rest of it. There are already other works that talk about these other complex and spectacular moments.But whether or not this rest of his life is present in this documentary, what anyone can feel after watching the work, as after listening to any album or watching any other show by the great Elvis Presley, is that good feeling of ""I want more"".",False
17,5,TCB: Elvis for the Tick Tock generation.,fostrhod,n/a,15/08/2025,"Return of the King: The Fall and Rise of Elvis Presley 2024.TCB It's Elvis for the Tik Tok generation.What can I say about this? Elvis was a phenomenal performer when given the opportunity and was pap when he wasn't.The documentary, made I would imagine to help rebuild the mythology of Elvis & get more royalties to the Elvis Presley Estate. It does serve it purpose.It is what it is. It's a great watch if you like 20 to 30 second soundbites of his songs and are not prepared to actually seek out the 1968 Special in its entirety.There are loads of exciting footage of Elvis in his raw early years, in decline (the movie years) and in in his prime 68 Comeback special, and that's where the film ends, so nothing in his sad Vegas, chicken in a basket days.Like 99% of all music documentary's you get numerous talking heads, talking about the subject, some close friends, family members, some, famous and some not so famous people talking about, in this case Elvis. Who really cares that a friend who saw him in the studio, thought he was seeing something spiritual or that Lisa, his ex-wife, thought ""wow he is so sexy"".To demean the late great Robbie Robertson, talking head as a ""Rock n Roll Hall of famer"", was pretty shabby. Look into his history pop fans.Those talking heads have clearly watched those previous documentaries about Elvis, because they repeat the same all tired lines about him.""Elvis was angry!, Elvis was taking back control! He tore up his contract!"" etc etc
Cut the crap, dispense with all this and you have a brilliant documentary, instead you have just another documentary., you even have to wait one full hour before you actually get to the 68 Comeback Special, which is the purpose of the film.I guess 99% of the viewing public, wouldn't have the inclination or patience to sit through that, and let's be honest some of that is pretty cheesy. For all the time spent bad mouthing Colonel Tom Parker, prior to Elvis, no musical entertainers, had ever had a prolonged career, without making movies, so he does deserve a little credit. It was his action post 68, which ultimately imprisoned and killed Elvis, both professionally and personally in his contract binding him to those tread mills concerts. What of his so called friends, each and every one on the pay role, it was in their interest to keep him plodding a long, and they too are still after that one last pay cheque.I'll repeat Tom Parker, will be rubbing his hand in heaven or hell, knowing that his investment is still coining in the dollars. Parker's biggest mistake was forcing Elvis, into the jump suited career path sleepwalking through the 70s.The saddest line in the whole movie, was when a young Elvis, when based in Germany said, that he would love to return to Europe to play some concerts. Of course, that never happened, did it Tom.So, in summing up. For everyone who loves Elvis, it is a great film, for others, its ok, ""too much conversation and not enough action"". Watch Baz Luhrmann's (one of the talking heads) Elvis film, which is stunning, or the 68 Comeback Special for the raw excitement both real and fictitious.I'll leave it to Conan O'Brien (presenter?) who says throughout all of Elvis's films, and shows, there was a lonely simple man whose talent trapped him into a lifestyle which ultimately destroyed him. (I paraphrased that a bit) Never a truer word has been said.Like the recent Brian Wilson / Beach Boys documentary, I see these documentaries for what they are cash cows.9/10 for the music, and raw footage. 1/10 for those talking heads and the tired format.""A little less conversation a bit more action guaranteed"" 5/10.PS I love Elvis, the late 60s and 70s Elvis, check out his back catalogue there are some amazing songs if you look.",False
18,8,An absorbing and fascinating portrait into a culture-changing icon...,mdw0526,n/a,15/08/2025,"I never understood Elvis growing up in 1970s Ohio. My parents were fans and we had his LPs in our wood console stereo cabinet, but to me, he was a Vegas lounge act from an era when where careers went there to die. After we watched Netflix's fascinating documentary on Elvis' 1968 NBC comeback special, ""Return of the King: The Fall and Rise of Elvis Presley"", I finally got it. This compact and insightful film gives a well-rounded view of the man, the myth, the legend, (re)igniting an admiration for his artistry.We then followed up with Sofia Coppola's film, ""Priscilla"", providing another layer of perspective on the Elvis story. The biopic gives the perspective of Priscilla Presley (though vociferously denied by Lisa Marie), offering a full view of the sad, complicated tale of a flawed genius gone too soon and the woman he loved. I found Priscilla more engaging than expected, and Coppola's direction and impeccable use of popular music, as seen to great effect in ""Marie Antoinette"", added depth and emotional resonance to the story.To close out our Elvis era, we re-watched Baz Luhrmann's ""Elvis"", featuring Austin Butler's magnetic portrayal, which was even better the second time round, and ""Viva Las Vegas"" with Elvis and Ann-Margret, in a light, frothy romp around Sin City. To wrap up my deep dive into all things Presley, I just started Lisa Marie and Riley Keough's biography ""From Here to the Great Unknown"".",False
19,9,Lord of the (music) rings,kosmasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"No pun intended - the documentary is primarily aimed at the people who love Elvis ... and it mainly focuses on one major event in his life (a sort of comeback story if you will). So in a sense it does not hurt if you are aware of the musician and person that everyone just calls Elvis (yes he had a last and yes you can see it in the title: Presley).We will get information and people talking about him outside that time frame - we will get to see personal clips of Elvis ... we will also see people interpreting and reading stuff into how Elvis behaved and what might have gone through his mind.So some of the stuff may not be 100% accurate to his mind set - but even with a documentary you have to have some suspension of disbelief. And Elvis had some troubled years ... but he would comeback again ... from Germany to the US but also to fame after the small bump on his way to immortality ... and that is maybe one of the things that people who take issue with Elvis might take ... well there is not much that will show a darker side to him. Priscilla was way too young when she met him ... in the movie where Austin Butler played him it was only hinted at - with the Priscilla solo movie it was way more at the forefront ... here it seems more like a celebration of him ... so again, if you have and take issue with that ... maybe this is not for you to watch.",False
20,10,Just wow...I LOVE IT!!! EVERYONE must see it,beetle-bevels-r,n/a,15/08/2025,"Return of the King is more than a documentary; it's a powerful tribute to one of the greatest comebacks in music history. The film effectively captures Elvis's struggles during the mid-1960s and how the 1968 Comeback Special reignited his career. The archival footage, interviews, and Jason Hehir's storytelling bring new life to a familiar story. Whether you're a lifelong Elvis fan or new to his music, this documentary is essential viewing. It paints a picture of an artist reclaiming his throne and redefining his legacy.This isn't just a music doc-it's a story of resilience, artistry, and reinvention. Jason Hehir frames Elvis's 1968 comeback as a cultural reset, showing how Presley overcame career stagnation and personal battles to reclaim his place atop the music world.

Billy Corgan? Even old man Springsteen, and the people who actually knew him, were around him were barely contributing to this nonsense. Robbie Robertson was listed as a 'contributor'? Seriously? Someone please tell the kids about The Band.There's far better documentary films floating about that give a far better glimpse into the history of Elvis, and I suppose because the former Mrs Elvis Presley is involved, it lends some sort of credibility in the eyes of those who don't know better.Typical Netflix garbage that shows nothing new, and please, someone remind old man Springsteen to listen to himself once in a while; talking about being inspired to rebel against the narrative while seriously lecturing people to knuckle under and follow the government is laughable.",False

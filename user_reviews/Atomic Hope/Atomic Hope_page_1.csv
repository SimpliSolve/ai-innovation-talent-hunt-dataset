1,9,Refreshing documentary that tackles a difficult subject,rodw-77-924268,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo many of the recent documentaries have been quite difficult to believe citing material that appears to be of dubious background.This one differs in that it appears to provide a reasoned viewpoint and is quite upfront in what it is trying to say. It doesn't seek to denigrate it's opponents but sticks to explaining what the documentary is about.The quality of production is excellent, it is well paced and structures itself in a series of chapters, much like a book.If you want a documentary that tells you about the benefits of nuclear energy and how it addresses climate change then this will work for you. It doesn't seek to delve into politics buts sticks to a statement of the fact as the presenters see them.Generally interesting and worth the watch.",True
2,10,Beautiful and Factual,jonasvestergaardmadsen-18014,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing documentary. It's not only incredibly beautiful and well produced, but also incredibly true.Sure, most facts are simplified to make it more consumable for the average Joe. Yet, they are still accurate and true, and easily verifiable.This is a good watch whether you are against or for nuclear. It's always good to challange your views and perceptions once in a while. One thing I really love to do. It's also good to become more educated on the things you support.The ending is absolutely beautiful and almost made me teary. It's really well thought-out.It's not that aggresive in the way it tries to pursue it's message, which is a big plus. You don't feel like you are hated, if you don't agree with the documentary's claims. Personally, I've been pro nuclear for about two or three years now, and I like the way this film tries to explain some of what makes nuclear good.",False
3,n/a,Review of Atomic Hope: Inside the pro-nuclear movement,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI posted my review here.Very much enjoyed watching Frankie Fenton's film Atomic Hope - Inside the pro-nuclear movement which premiered at Toronto HotDocs festival May 4th, 2022 about the people who advocate for the future of nuclear energy as a solution to climate change. The film starts appropriately by demonstrating the challenges the movement faces. The first guest is Moto-Yasu Kinoshita, the Chief Nuclear Engineer of Thorium Tech Solutions from Japan. The director creatively composes the next sequence where Kinoshita speaks against a quality music track, about the distinction between the atomic bomb and nuclear energy. Kinoshita's own family were victims of the atomic bomb. No other people know better than the Japanese the dilemma our planet is faced with. Essentially we must convince people that the two technologies are opposites and independent of one another.To give context, the opening shows dramatic historical clips from the enormous explosions and mushroom clouds of the past which deliver the message that fear of anything nuclear is justified. But also more positive clips appear like Eisenhower and the Atoms for Peace initiative. Still, it might seem counterintuitive to expect the audience to be sympathetic while showing the extraordinary power of the bomb. Fenton's portrayal of the pro-nuclear advocates show them to be credible people faced with the knowledge that their solution to climate change is the only solution where the risk of climate change far outweighs the risk of nuclear energy. Generally it is seen by them as the safest energy source. With time running out there's the double challenge of first, winning public opinion and second, building the nuclear plants fast enough.The director gambles with his story-telling, making the next segment about false statements, starting with Helen Caldicott and moving onto Cindy Folkers from Beyond Nuclear who says ""There is no safe radiation dose"" which is such an irresponsible thing to say and of course totally false, as the bananas example later in the film demonstrates. (note: Photo at top shows Eric Meyer riding a banana - reminiscent of famous film moment in the classic Dr. Strangelove) Who knew? After all, we eat radio-active substances, swim in the radio-active oceans and bathe in the radio-active sun without serious consequences.The film is organized into chapters.Chapter One - A Movement BeginsThe film introduces John Kutsch, founder of Thorium Energy Alliance (TEA). He is one of the leading pro-nuclear advocates, with his entourage of followers. Kutsch not only organizes the conferences but also finds time to approach congress, senators and lawmakers hailing the value of nuclear energy, molten salt reactors and most of all Thorium and how it ties into the big picture.Video footage from TEA conferences (AKA TEAC) has a large following and largely grew as a result of filming the early days with Kirk Sorensen, pioneering founder of Energy from Thorium, speaking about the wonders of Thorium and inventor Alvin Weinberg's contribution. Gordon McDowell deserves credit for the success of widespread interest in Thorium. He filmed and tirelessly edited the numerous speakers' talks from the conferences, uploading them to his youtube channel. Gordon continues to this day providing assistance to their needs. Kutsch spreads the word in several ways. John Kutsch and James Kennedy are unofficial partners in their efforts to make Thorium and mining rare earths accepted practice in the US, thereby allowing the growth of industries that currently are totally dominated by China. These finer points are understandably not in the film considering such details are worthy of an entire film of their own.Eric Meyer is President of Generation Atomic. He has not only attracted a loyal following of young people but has formed a non-profit organization who after educating his members they educate the public door to door. Meyer started off as a volunteer camera operator for the Thorium Energy Alliance conferences. He started his advocacy full time spending nearly a year with Environmental Progress before launching Generation Atomic. The film shows a glimpse of his accomplishments and how he has travelled, organized and performed at numerous public events internationally, including the TEA conferences themselves. Meyer credits Michael Shellenberger and James Hansen, who we see later in the film, for raising his awareness of the importance of preserving existing reactors. Both Meyer and Shellenberger have successfully contributed to preventing several shutdowns including two Illinois nuclear plants and it's starting to look like Diablo Canyon Generating Station will be next.Mothers for Nuclear is briefly highlighted with Kristen Zaitz and Heather Hoff making appearances. We all know how mothers are often overprotective of their children which is exactly why their perspective on nuclear power is so important. As mothers they care about their children's futures. They happen to also work at Diablo Canyon one of the best run nuclear plants in the country.Many pro-nuclear advocates maintain the position that once you see a nuclear plant in operation you can't help but marvel at their energy capability. Visiting a nuclear plant has often made a convert of known fence-sitters.Michael Shellenberger is one the most prominent pro-nuclear environmentalists. Not only has he contributed as both an excellent author and charismatic speaker but a strategist and leader in getting the word out. Let's hope the timing of this film's release coincides with him winning his second bid to become Governor of California. Having launched The Breakthrough Institute and now Environmental Progress, Shellenberger has excelled in his research and authoring of articles, reports, speaking at rallies and doing Ted Talks. Also like others in the film, he provides much needed testimony at various hearings. Shellenberger is a great example of how we can change our minds and grow in unexpected ways.A natural born activist, his early years had some success in advocating against nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. After becoming pro-nuclear he developed a friendship with historian/author Richard Rhodes who wrote The Making of the Atomic Bomb. Shellenberger became in some people's eyes too controversial for his views about nations who acquire nuclear weapons. Shellenberger is a diverse individual and unlike many he is extremely well versed and eloquent in expressing his feelings and passions as well as facts. Shellenberger's recent book San Fransicko shows his other side as a humanitarian and social worker. In an excerpt from his Ted Talk How Fear of Nuclear Power is Hurting the Environment, he explains the irony that statistically Nuclear power is the safest way to create electricity.Chapter Two - Disaster
Iida Ruilshalme is the next profile, a tireless nuclear advocate and author of the Thoughtscapism blog, is a cell biologist and a member of Mothers For Nuclear. A trip to Chernobyl helps clear up many misconceptions of nuclear energy. Iida gets a tour with Professor Jim Smith a Professor of Environmental Science and author of Chernobyl, Catastrophe and Consequences. Professor Gerry Thomas a Professor and chair of Molecular Pathology joins the discussion and they share views about risk perception regarding radiation. Smith states ""The nuclear risk is something that is horrifying but at the same time you have to balance that very tiny risk with the known risk, damage from climate change."" He perhaps overstates using the word ""horrifying."" In the same segment Professor Thomas explains that ""There is absolutely no evidence at all that fetal deformities are caused by radiation from Chernobyl."" This is a controversial statement considering past anti-nuclear fundraising efforts have often included photos of children with birth defects attributed to radiation.Iida returns carrying around a geiger counter to measure radiation for herself. She took readings on her flight on the way to the Ukraine. Like any other flights with high elevation, her flight documented higher level readings than the highest measured reading she obtained during her visit to various places around Chernobyl.Chapter Three - Science is all we have
Eric Meyer returns to say about the anti-nuclear environmentalists ""They want a clean environment but the work that they are doing is actually working against what they care about."" Perhaps the biggest hero to the pro-nuclear movement is climate scientist James Hansen ""Why do I speak out on this subject? There's no way to phase off all fossil fuels within a few decades without the help of nuclear power which I think is pretty clear.""
Chapter Four - The Outsiders
From three different continents these ""outsiders"" assemble to raise awareness and educate the public. Ben Heard, energy analyst from Australia, carries a big box of bananas alongside author Rauli Partanen from Finland and Taylor Stevenson from America (also a member of Generation Atomic) who are walking to the designated area for their participation at the COP 23 conference. The bananas are an awareness raising strategy to explain how people really don't understand radiation. Later Stevenson and Heard stare out in disbelief at the enormity of a coal mining operation in Germany.The next scene evokes a real sense of sadness when the team arrives at the conference they are not allowed a seat at the climate conference table reinforcing how big the challenge to get the word out really is. This underlies the motivation for the film. Whatever forces are preventing acceptance of nuclear energy from progressing is made poignant by their plan. They refuse to accept the rejection and set up their tables outside the conference with the hope of speaking to some of the attendees. Passersby pretty much ignore solicitations to speak. In the end they must face the reality that their audience will be the cameras.Another signific.",True
4,4,Too one-sided,leif-bonderup,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you already know the arguments for nuclear energy this documentary won't give you any value. Very traditional in the way of portraying a movement - with no real edge or counter points.I had hoped for a movie that could give me an understanding of dilemmas, reflections on knowledge and uncertainities, risks on many different kinds of categories, and how to look at the slowness of building nuclear plants.The documentary is only one-sided and just holding the microphone. No challenging questions. The only reason for me to watch the whole movie was because I hoped to learn from a movement that has other points of views than me; but I knew all their arguments on beforehand and the movie does not tell anything new.",False
5,10,feed back,manusiyum,n/a,16/08/2025,"I appreciated how ""Atomic Hope"" not only used scientific concepts as a backdrop but also integrated them into the storyline, making the science an integral part of the narrative. This approach added depth to the characters' motivations and actions, elevating the overall viewing experience.The attention to detail in depicting the scientific equipment, laboratories, and theoretical discussions was impressive. It demonstrated the filmmakers' commitment to authenticity and brought a sense of realism to the movie.As a physicist, I often find myself cringing at the misrepresentations of science in popular media, but ""Atomic Hope"" pleasantly surprised me with its dedication to accuracy. I wholeheartedly applaud the filmmakers for taking the time and effort to get the science right, while also delivering an emotionally impactful and compelling story.",False
6,10,The beautiful human story about individual struggle to deliver an important message.,meyerm-17676,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a beautifully told story about how passionate individuals started a worldwide movement. . . And the struggles they encountered in their early days.It's not an info dump about nuclear energy, rather a human story that you can connect with.I love how the director chose interesting characters and exposed both their strengths and flaws as well as the triumphs and failures along their journey to change minds.It is a film that will make you feel inspired afterwards to want to make a difference in the world in whatever issue you feel passionate about.I would highly recommend watching this regardless of your interest in nuclear or energy in general!",False

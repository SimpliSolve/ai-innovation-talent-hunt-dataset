1,4,Only one funny comedian,MikeHunt1075,n/a,16/08/2025,"Snoop Dogg mustve been too high to think this is the best comedian's he could find... mustve been on very short notice. The only comedian who was actually funnny was DeRay Davis.The rest sounded like they where getting laughs from a hidden away from camera view sign that lit up to tell the audience to laugh. That or it's just edited to make it seem like they where getting laughs.The this pretty much goes down like a lot of Snoop Doggs films, he even mentions during the show one film he recommends no one ever sees, I'm sure in future he'll be telling people not to bother watching this show either.If DelRays routine ends up on the Tube, watch that if you want to, but don't bother with anyone else who stunk up the joint.",False
2,6,A couple good acts but for the rest too much ego's.,deloudelouvain,n/a,16/08/2025,"Comedy specials, it's rarely a success, and this one isn't one either. I do like Snopp Dogg but he should just stick to what he does the best and that's music. From the five comedians he presented there were three that had a decent show, the rest wasn't that funny. What I also didn't like were the interviews between two acts, too much ego's and kissing a**es, totally unnecessary. But I enjoyed three artists so I guess it was not all a waste. But for a 1 hour show it's just not enough to be remembered. Comedy specials are just good to discover new talents, but I'd rather watch just one performer during an hour than five short acts where you just don't have the time to warm up.",False
3,5,Average good standup combining some music from Snoop Dawg,toreaurstad-57248,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is set like a party and people sit in a sofa and smoke ... well they are smoking some heavy shi..
Performances of comedians telling jokes are pretty average and we have heard a lot of the jokes before. But I guess this show has its fan base and listening to Snoop telling about growing up and admiring pimps is at the same time a sad story on the struggles of everyday life.But these black entertainers now got a lot of money and I liked seeing that guy from Chapelle show. Missed the robot dancer.But we get it Snoop. He is rich bi**tch!Katt Williams was really infunny btw.",False
4,1,Yawn,Brew_Swayne,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWith the exception of a few funny one liners here and there, most of the jokes didn't land and the material was mostly tired and unimaginative. Every comedian had a slightly different variation of a Chris Rock/Will Smith joke. Didn't anyone review the material beforehand and suggest that maybe 5 different comedians shouldn't all lead with the same joke? A woman comedian talking about her love of dick? That routine has been done enough time by enough women now that it's no longer shocking or taboo or, ya know, funny. Even Mike Epps, who is easily the most recognizable name in the lineup, was just a rambling mess. This whole thing had the feel of an open mic night at some janky bar, but with higher production values.",True
5,7,Who's the guy that was on stage the whole time?,chrismagnum-95089,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved the special and everything, it was a pretty chill vibe and I can't lie I laughed at a couple of parts, but the whole time I was watching it I kept looking at the guy that was on the stage, sitting on the couch next to the two women. It was kinda weird and a little creepy ngl, it always took me away from some of the jokes at times when the camera kept panning over him, or when he was in almost every frame of the show - probably a good 80% of the time he was shown in the background of every shot of the special, if you want to see the guy I'm talking about look at 40:36 to see him, it's really weird imo.",False
6,2,Embarrassing,cooblimey,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like Snoop and I even like the often divisive Kat Williams, but I turned this off after skipping the first fifteen minutes and getting to Williams' opening act. I say skipping the first fifteen minutes because it's just an embarrassing ego performance by Snoop who, I can only assume, was too high to concentrate on the laughs. The camera frequently cut to the audience guffawing at Snoop's one-liners, leaving me wondering what the joke was that I'd just missed. There's the odd bit of half-hearted rapping and sing-along but I just wasn't feeling it, and I don't think Snoop was either. I ended up skipping the remainder of the 'opening act', which was at least fifteen minutes long, to get to Kat Williams. ""At last"", I thought, ""now for the comedy"". Nah, not really. Kat was mildly amusing but those cuts to the audience members roaring with laughter must have been taken from a different part of the night. With the show now in full swing and me barely raising an eyebrow in amusement, I turned it off.",False
7,2,"Katt Williams, Mike Epps, Deray Davis, & still a huge flop!!!",takarimccain,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was the worst performance by each comedian that I've even seen! I give Snoop 1 star for trying and the comedians 1 start for showing up... Comedy is in trouble; these veterans are gettin old and don't have ""it"" anymore. I didn't laugh at more than 1 Katt Williams joke. I didn't laugh at any of Deray Davis jokes. Mike Epps wasn't funny. Guy Torry was bad. Donnell Rawlings wasn't on his game. The female comedian was trash. Snoop Dogg is usually a great host, but he was uncharacteristically corny. Snoop tried to have a mini concert playing his 90's gangster hits instead of his more grown & sexy hits for his diverse crowd. He should have performed Sexual Eruption!",True
8,1,Not worth it,rodrigohenkel,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Snoop Dogg, but this special was not funny at all. Very few jokes that really made me laugh. Even Katt Williams wasn't as funny as he used to be in his shows.",False
9,8,Hilarious,stevenswig,n/a,16/08/2025,"This has a rating of 5 point something, so I clearly don't know what people find funny. I loved Deray, the woman, Katt Williams, and the guy from Chappelle's show.",False
10,1,LOL really?,backup-50362,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not one white or asian comedian, just black males? LMAO I like how Netflix made ALL of the other comedians to ""diversify"" and pretend their friends are super multiracial but this special magically ain't like this.Oooooh Netflix. Anyway I love Snoop but those comedians sucked. Katt Willians seems like a decent guy, and I appreciate that he was shockingly not doing too much political or racial humor like basically everyone else, but it just wasn't really entertaining.",False
11,2,Oh no,iamjamalwhite,n/a,16/08/2025,Not worth a free rental. Snoop sings a bunch including his 2 hits then introduces only comedians that look like him. Katt Williams was funny. Wanda Sykes was so ridiculously offensive we turned it off. Just blah. Don't even bother. Can't imagine paying to be there in person and not able to leave.,False
12,1,Not funny. Full of himself. Boring.,rakestraw-09643,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have no idea why people think he is considered entertaining. He's not!!!! I have a lot of respect for Black actors and entertainers, but not Snoop Dogg. You look at Denzel Washington, The Supremes, Billy Holliday and I could go on and on, but I just can't stand Snoop Dogg. Enough said!!! If he could hold a tune or play multiple instruments with professional accuracy, I might be less harsh with my review. I won't purchase any product that he is in the advertisement for. I would enjoy meeting him and expressing my opinions face-to-face. Many of my friends have the same feelings that I have about this fool. He seems very self-centered and egotistical.",False
13,10,DeRay!!!,jointerkayla,n/a,16/08/2025,"He is, by far, one of the funniest comedians! He is so comfortable on stage and he is such a natural!! I laughed so hard at his set!!! The other comedians were funny as well but he definitely stole the show! Kudos to Snoop for putting this together.-iCurlyCae.",False
14,10,Hilarious!!!,leonpmarshall,n/a,16/08/2025,This was just bought so much joy to my evening. I couldn't stop laughing. I really wished I lived closer to LA to go watch this live. I hope to see another stand up show from snoop like this again!!!,False
15,10,Freakin Hilarious!!!!!!,phneely-351-443535,n/a,16/08/2025,Laughter is good for soul. I laughed so hard until my stomach hurt and my eyes filled up with tears. I was glad to see every comedian. I hope Snoop Dogg host another one.,False
16,10,You have to watch this! ðŸ˜‚,dancingtreespirits,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great people great times! All the fantastic performers I grew up with. Funny as hell!! From Deray to Day Day and Katt Williams. I couldn't quit laughing. I was sending clips to my kid in Florida. I'm watching it again. Don't miss this special. Really wonderful people. Thanks for the great hour!** And.. what are these bad reviews about.. 'people with sticks up their bums'?..
It's a fkn around special, don't be so serious. Y'all can't say you didn't laugh and you shut your tv off! If 'Derays circle of cock clappin' didn't have you rollin there's something wrong with you!",False
17,10,The Worllllllllllllld is in need of Love and Laughter!!,jada-14412,n/a,16/08/2025,"The soundtrack was awesome, the comedians, were funny asf and the couch was a desired spot for Me!! I Loved It Everyone was Funny and the music was jamming!!!!! Ready for #2!!!!!",False
18,8,A Must-See,nubyanquyn,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was hilarious and if you are not familiar with Snoop and the ""fam"", don't watch it if you don't have an open mind and pay attention to the subtle cues. I LOVED it!!! They need to do this more often. The line-up was great, the conversations were real, the shenanigans were in flight, and the laughs were hard!!! I know comedians are on high alert after the whole ""Will vs. Rock"" thing, but it was good, unfiltered, unadulterated, comedy and I'll probably watch it another 20 times. It was a lot better than many of the other comedy shows and I also appreciate NetFlix for being so open to suck a wonderful and powerful project. They need to do a series of different comedians every month.",False

1,9,Beautiful and Inspiring,lukemooreAASH,n/a,17/08/2025,"Pressured veins and heavy breaths mark those moments as Captain Ramadan watches Asmaa keeping her grips on the weight bar against her chest.A relationship of love, hope and fulfilment. Lift Like a Girl is a beautiful Egyptian story with great challenges and compassion on and off screen for too many people.",False
2,10,How no one knows this movie! Absolutely phenomenal,gogigun,n/a,17/08/2025,"I can't understand nor imagine how such a great movie no one ever heard of. The movie follows the story of Captain Ramadan Who devote his life to create a generation of women wheat lifters in miserable conditions. The purity, the devotion and the energy of the man will leave u speechless. Especially when u see his little great results. Such a splendid movie.",False
3,10,SENSATIONAL,enekidu-45698,n/a,17/08/2025,"I dont know where to start, the people themselves. The man who dedidacted his life and all what he has for the sport he love and making champions, with no resources, made world and olympic champions. Raising this whole generation of girls to be better than boys. Asmaa, such a great emotional champion, who as usual in Egypt, at the risk of being forgotten and ignored by authorties, still doing what she loves. Nahla and Essmat !And the movie itself, captured real raw honest emotions of all these people going through their tough luves, not giving up, simply cos thats all what they got. Mayye did a phenomenal job, such an uplifting movie.",False

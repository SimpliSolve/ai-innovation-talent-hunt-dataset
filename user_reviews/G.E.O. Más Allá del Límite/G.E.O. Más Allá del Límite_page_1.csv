1,9,What you'll see is what you get,portal1790,n/a,15/08/2025,"G. E. O. Is the elite force of the Spanish police equivalent to the S. W. A. T. In the USA. But to get there it is necessary, in addition to being a police officer, to go through an intensive course of 7 1/2 months carried out precisely so that ""no candidate reaches the end"". And there are courses that in fact none is enough. The physical and psychological being is difficult to describe. Hence this Fantastic Documentary of ""Yuri Original"". Just seeing and believing. There are no doubles here. No actors. ""What you'll see is what you get"". And get ready because this action is not for the weakest. SIMPLY DIVINAL. Just a little aside; I have nothing against Netflix. Quite the contrary. There are series that I really like. ""Mindhunter"" for example. But usually when there's a show that I fall in love with, it's still not Netflix. Opinions....",False
2,10,Best documentary series I've seen. Honestly,eduardomaclean,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is probably one of the most immersive documentaries out there right now. They way it's shot is so incredibly competent, that very often I forgot it was a documentary.One of the greatest achievements is how well the doc is edited. They're able to create a complete story with a beginning, middle and end, perfectly structured. Even the ""characters"" had amazing character arcs.The best description would be that it's exactly like watching ""Heartbreak Ridge"" in real life. I highly recommend this, one of the best shows of 2021, if not the best.",False
3,10,"Values, principles, persistence and many more.",josemariallosa,n/a,15/08/2025,"The series show a group of men that go beyond the extreme and keep pushing in the GEO training course. Unbelievable beautiful, you feel their efforts, passion and commitment. The teachers of the 30th GEO group are extraordinary men that take on the riskiest spanish police missions.Great scenery and footage at Guadalajara headquarters.A special mention goes to inspector Pelayo sense of duty and the way he works with the trainees. One word for him: super human.",False
4,10,Wonderful,richantmiller,n/a,15/08/2025,"I wantedvto comment on reddice26 review. He/she knocks the factvthat it's all physical/mental testing vs actual training. This is the same with all elite units. I have watched MANY shows on the Navy SEALs selection process and it is very similar. You must first go through grueling selection process BEFORE they train you. They aren't going to train the entire group of applicants, just the ones that are ultimately selected. The training of this unit would be an entirely different show (Season 2 would be nice!!). Show sometimes feels like a movie vs a documentary. It is very well made. I highly recommend this to all.",False
5,6,Meh...,reddice26,n/a,15/08/2025,"Pretty boring documentary about a sub-standard SWAT-like unit. Not so sure what's so special about this, pretty much every country in the world has a similar type of police/military branch. The people in it are real for sure, but the fact that they are not being trained, but just pushed across their edge makes this whole exercise silly. Most likely it has to do with budgetary constraints in the Spanish polish force than anything else, as they are considered pawns instead of assets. In any other country you have to be the best of the best to even try out and often you are asked to participate, not in Spain apparently, there any ordinary police officer can just enroll. Pretty sad to be honest. I suppose in the end you get the same result, but I doubt this is more future proof.",False

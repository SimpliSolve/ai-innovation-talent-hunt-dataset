1,8,A perspective which you can't see on the field,lionel-nie,n/a,16/08/2025,"The english football team of 2004-2006 was the golden generation and ronney was the golden boy of that generation. I have been following rooney since his star performance in EURO 2004, How he impressed ferguson and moved to united and made history. But this documentary throws lights on many other aspects of his life. His nature, his raw talent, his character and his opinion on all that he has done on and off the field including acceptance and justification. Perhaps nothing in rooney's life is not known but nevertheless it is a good watch. Rooney was a damn agressive, strong, skilled and definitely a great team player. It felt that rooney knew he was a great player even before starting his club football career. I also liked the interviews of gary neville. The documentary was very nostalgic too. I still remeber the 2006 quarter final red card against portugal.This documentary is not just about rooney but i think this is about any star sports person. Their perspectives, their challenges and all they need to endure being a star including their rise, their ups and downs and their final innings of hanging their boots and moving on to new things in life.",False
2,7,Would recommend.,TreeFiddy53,n/a,16/08/2025,"Regardless of whatever club you support, this is a good watch. For United fans, this one's a must-watch. Well shot too, but you expect that from the football videos that Prime's been putting out lately.",False
3,7,"Interesting, but not ground breaking.",kenbo-87360,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a big fan of Man Utd and Derby County for all my life. This documentary sounds tailor made for somebody like me.While I enjoyed it, there was nothing in there that I didn't already know.Wayne came across well, he talked to the camera openly and honestly, and has matured into a top bloke.I can't imagine many non-footballing fans enjoying it much. There isn't enough 'car crash' viewing for a casual watcher, so it may not hold their attention.Hopefully there might be a follow up when he achieves the impossible this season and keeps DCFC from relegation!",False
4,7,Wayne's World,Lejink,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's not often my wife suggests we watch anything related to football but she especially asked to watch this documentary on the Everton, Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney. The all-time top scorer for both United and his country, Rooney, now the manager of struggling Championship side Derby County has simultaneously released both this film and his autobiography but my wife's interest is much less in his glittering football career than in his chequered personal life and of course, in particular his well-publicised marriage to his childhood sweetheart Coleen. She, as I write, is embroiled in a very public court case against her fellow ""WAG"" (tabloid-press shorthand for ""Wives and Girlfriends"", the name given to the highly-publicised assorted group of women who accompanied their England international hubbies and boyfriends to a major tournament) Rebekah Vardy, the wife of Rooney's fellow-striker Jamie Vardy, wittily termed the ""Wagatha Christie War"" and is an important presence in this film which if not quite a warts-and-all portrait of Roo, at least asks both him and her pointed questions about aspects of his personal behaviour, particularly concerning alcohol and prostitutes.Before all that, we are presented with his back story as a working-class kid who was frequently in trouble even before he became a teenager. The saving of him was his undoubted football talent which saw him quickly signed up by his local team Everton where he broke through to the first team aged only 16 and announce himself in his first match against then champions Arsenal by scoring the stunning winning goal against them after coming on as a substitute. Within a couple more years he was playing for England and had signed for Manchester United in a record transfer deal, sealing his position as a world-class player with a hat-trick in his debut match for United in a Champions League match and then excelling in his first big tournament for England, the 2002 Euros.Intermittent injuries and erratic behaviour in his personal life arguably blighted his legacy in the game but even though he won several honours with United, such as the Champions League, World Club Championship and several Premier League titles, the pundits' verdict on his career is that he somehow never quite achieved the recognition as a football legend that contemporaries like Ronaldo and Messi did. His indomitable will-to-win is shown in revelations that he deliberately injured Chelsea captain (and fellow England teammate) John Terry, after the Blues had the temerity to rock up under new manager Jose Mourinho to take United's title and hiding a training injury sustained during a major tournament from the England manager Eriksson.Here, he gets the chance to state his case. He's honest about his past indiscretions both on an off the field, sitting quietly next to his presumably long-suffering wife as she offers something short of forgiveness on her side for the pain he's put her through. Today though, they seem reconciled as they move together into a fantastic luxury house and plays with their young children. He remembers the tough love and support he got from his family growing up, especially from his mother and now deceased grandmother. Naturally there are testimonies from past teammates such as Gary Neville, David Beckham and Rio Ferdinand as well as past rivals like Thierry Henry and his England manager Goran-Eriksson but strangely nothing from his most famous team-mate Ronaldo or his legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson.Still, the picture emerges of a 100% football man, still involved in the game, and more at peace now with himself. The hope is that he can settle down to enjoy the considerable fruits of his labours and settle down into family life. After watching this admittedly soft-focus take on his life and career to date, I wish him well on his continuing twin journeys inside and outside football.",False
5,7,Giving a generous 7 coz I love Rooney(not the documentary),um-88672,n/a,16/08/2025,"To me this looked like an elaborate video to seek apology from his wife for all the naughty escapades he has had in the past. I get it, it was a part of his life,but that incident is like 40prcnt of the documentary. I was hoping to see more on his ManUtd days, the rivalries during that time, the dominance, heartbreaks, Post SAF era, some more on his move to MLS and more importantly his new challenge as a manager at Derby. The Derby journey would have given us so much more about the new Wayne that we all want to know more about. All that aside, I liked the part where they showed his rise at England National Team and his struggle with injury before every big international tournament.",False
6,6,Wazza isn't a bad lad,andyll-smith,n/a,16/08/2025,"Scouse lad likes to kick things a lot you know it's not the most original story ever but my do I love the accent. Really big fan of the graphic effects and recreations, looked impressive and how they got whole crowds in there too - crazy! So yeah overall a good sports fiction flick, with some weird tabloid romance drama thrown in.Absolute merkage from Rio.",False
7,6,More about promoting his career,allanmichael30,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not just about his private life, as advertised, which is good and does not address all story's and sleaze. Its all about his big impact he made as a kid and his football achievements.",False
8,7,Rooney,mmuggi,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDocumentary designed to cement Wayne Rooney's status as a sporting great and a family man, along with a healthy dose of public humiliation. And FA might want to take interest in the fact, that Rooney deliberatly injured another player in a important match.",True
9,9,One of the greatest players England has ever produced.,annie-53300,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerUsually when a celebrity gets involved in these kind of things you don't usually get the personal controversies but Wayne and Colleen discussed his past indescrepencies which impressed me.In depth look at his life.Very good.,True
10,6,Rooney!!!,borhank,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rooney is a sports documentary about Wayne Rooneys rise to become one of not only Englad's but the Worlds best footballers ever.Wayne Rooney comes from humble begginings like the everyday person and in this documentary we see his growth as a person and a footballer.Wayne Rooneys path is not the smoothest you see it does have plenty of bumps on the road to the path of being one of the greats and we see how although the documentary is about him we see that he is one of the greatest team players you ever see.This doco shows some of the greats talking about Wayne and what kind of person and footballer Wayne is.We hear from Sven Errikson the old England coach. We hear from David Moyes Waynes Everton coach and Sir Alex Fergusson the greatest Man Utd Coach there ever will be.We hear from Rivals and teammates like Thery Henry, David Beckham, Gary Neville and Rio Ferdinand
You have to say when Fergesson was still in charge Man Utd was still one of the worlds best teams now not so much.We go on the trip from childhood footy star to his prefessional leage career including the ups and downs of his international English career.For English football with the team at the time would have been the best time for them to be able to win with the stars like Beckham, Rooney, John Terry, Rio Ferdinand and Steven Gerard just to name a few this was one of the worlds best teams ever assembled.I did not expect much from this documentary but it did surpass my exxpectations.If your a fan of football and sports documentaries this is something you should watch.This is more than just about football.",False
11,9,Fantastic. Grips you from the first moment and never lets go!,mayankmmz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I very seldom write reviews on anything I watch, but after finishing this documentary, I had to. Wayne Rooney is the player that made me love football and made me love Manchester United. This documentary was a great insight into the career of the ultimate team player.Kudos to the team for the way they approached the sensitive and controversial part of his story and didn't shy away from them. It was fascinating to see what was rooney thinking in the important moments of his career. Loved the scenes with his wife and their little boys.The sound design is the ultimate MVP of the documentary in my opinion. The use of music and even commentary during the football scenes are so well handled. Congratulations to the director and rest of the team for this treat for all football fans.",False
12,4,Rooney's Greatest Hits,agrierwork,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film opens in operatic fashion with Wayne sticking and moving against a punching bag to a cinematic score, drawing parallels to Raging Bull, a film that focuses on a real-life figure who's anger and intensity benefit him in the ring, but become his downfall overall, as his relationships and public image suffer from those same impulses. Unfortunately, the allegories and cinematic ambition ends there. What we are left with is familiar footage of famous matches most will know the score to, and uninspired interviews that serve only as an affirmation of one man's legacy within the beautiful game.From the same producers of contemporary classics such as 'Diego Maradona, 2019' and 'Supersonic, 2016' this film's subject figure is not out of place when compared to the latter in terms of ability, celebrity, and the polarisation of public reception to their image over the years. However, whilst those aforementioned documentaries pulled no punches, getting to the heart of their subject through a balanced representation, this film feels more like a promotion of the name, as opposed to an authentic exploration of a figure who has captivated the nation, for better or for worse with his footballing and personal exploits.This familiar, and at times insightful documentary looks into the many highs and lows of the celebrated and highly decorated international footballer Wayne Rooney. From his time at the pinnacle of club football with Manchester United, to his eventual transition into management with Derby County.Clocking in at 1 hour, 45 this documentary works as more of a tribute than an examination of the player. We get to see what made Rooney a trail blazer as a boy among men, going from his youth days at Everton as a young boy, to quickly becoming the great hope for the underachieving 'golden age' generation of players.Rooney was a polarising figure as a player, and as a film 'Rooney' will have viewers divided for different reasons. Choosing such a title is apt for this documentary as the film focuses on the celebrity and the 'baller', but spends little time with 'Wayne' the man. The scenes we do see of Wayne that aren't archive, appear contrived and a bit too polished, whereas the film comes to life when exploring Wayne's achievements and moments on the pitch, and this is an occurring problem when half of the film is Wayne and Colleen addressing the camera through anecdotes.The film's biggest issue is perspective, as we are told several opinions from a very narrow and controlled point of view. Events are commentated on from the Rooney camp predominantly. From his wife and ex gaffer Sir Alex, to Garry Neville and David Beckham. There is little to no insight from the public, media or people outside his social sphere in general, whilst the interviews feel very one note and lacking in insight. Quite amazing considering some of the insight these people have. Infamous incidents involving prostitutes and scandal are merely touched on before moving on swiftly back to the football and medals. There is no challenging of his character in a documentary that is sorely lacking in conflict, especially considering its subject matter.Regarding the timing of the film's release, it's a conflict of interest when you consider Rooney's recent move into management. Because of this, the motivations behind its existence have to be called into question. The documentary comes off as one large P. R move to polish Rooney's image whilst he has his say on past 'transgressions'. Something else to consider is the fact that his story has not yet finished. At the age of 37, I'm sure there will be a lot more to the Rooney odyssey to come.Ultimately, in an era where contemporary football documentaries such as 'Sunderland 'Til I die, 2018' and 'Tottenham 'All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur, 2020' give fresh insight into professional football culture through innovative exploration and a 'fly on the wall' approach that shows more than the polished idyllic image of a professional player, this film offers little in way of moving the genre forward. I feel because of this, fans of Manchester United, England and football in general may enjoy this film, but it brings little else to the table as a documentary. Rooney's greatest hits would have been a more appropriate name for this unfortunate puff piece that had so much potential.",False
13,9,Wayne's journey to self-actualisation: The ultimate team player,tchiura,n/a,16/08/2025,"Came in expecting the usual conceited and exaggerated hubris associated with biopics. Wazza happens to be my childhood hero so I wasn't going to mind at all. Boy was I in for a delightful perturbation. The movie doesn't shy away from Wayne's shortcomings as a teammate, professional, role model and most importantly, family man. Its incredulous the amount of scenes where Colleen and Wayne are both visibly uncomfortable not shying away from invasive probing about the cheating and escort scandals. To give context, on social media there's a running joke about Wayne 's affairs occurring annually. Looking from the outside, it feels as though Wayne is making a last ditch attempt to rectify his somewhat tarnished image. He emphasises his discontent with his actions before candidly expressing the desire to be viewed ""as a good person."" His transgressions are largely attributed to alcohol abuse and unwholesome peer pressure. Rooney fans will no doubt glee as we peer the lenses on his parenting style. Insightful revelations on the origin of Wayne's bullish and passionate approach to football will put you on the edge of your seat. The admiration from legendary rivals such as Thierry Henry and Jose Mourinho exemplify the immensity of Wazza's legacy. Former England coach, Sven-Goran Eriksson finding out on camera how a 21 year-old Wayne Rooney played through a 6-inch groin tear after recovering from the infamous metatarsal injury at the 2006 world cup epitomises the compulsion to succeed for the Three Lions. Avid fans of English football will find themselves in reverence awe as football royalties David Beckham. Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville recollect early impressions of young Wazza. Although the production addresses an abundance of relevant career related questions, it does exclude one pivotal question. Is Wayne really satisfied? Does he feel he could've handled himself differently and possibly achieved more? Does the former teenage phenom regret not winning a Ballon d'Or? Does he regret routinely arriving to training camps overweight and out shape? Does he regret not living a healthier lifestyle and reaching the longevity of contemporaries such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic? Despite being Manchester United's greatest goal scorer, is Wayne Rooney at peace with his INDIVIDUAL career? Ultimately the theme of the movie is Wazza's dedication to being the greatest TEAM player ever. Fans can reasonably conclude individual accolades probably have no substance in his path to self-actualisation. Strong recommend for football fans.",False
14,10,SUPER WAZZA,stango-44768,n/a,16/08/2025,Best sports documentary you will watch this year especially if you are a similar age to Rooney the England memories. One of the most underrated players of our era easy one the best footballers to grace this planet. Really enjoyed how normal it portraits him great stuff!,False
15,5,Everything you already knew,aaronhoward-43306,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm fairly certain this documentary could be made without Wayne Rooney's contribution. You would still come away with the same insight you already had about him as a player and what you read in the papers.Skirting around stories you want hear, not being completely open about what happened in them, too much footage of old football matches and interviews with fellow professionals saying all the stuff you've heard a million times before on Sky Sports.It's all very meh. It feels like this film has been made with a couple of interviews of Rooney, a filming afternoon at his house and some short interviews with pros telling us how great he was AND a TONNE of video tape from the Premier League and FIFA tournaments.I think it's possible to piece this film together using YouTube footage if you really wanted. It's clear, his agent Stretford still clearly has his grubby little hands on commercial Rooney stuff.",False
16,8,Rooney in his own words,WayneGreen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you are a Manchester United fan, Derby fan or an England fan then you will know who Wayne Rooney is.This documentary let's us know what went on in his head as a footballer playing for clubs like Manchester United, Everton and Derby. Also the shocking abmission that he turned to drink to cope with the pressure of playing for a big club like Man Utd & also dealing with fame which he found hard to cope with.",True
17,10,Terrific,geoffreypizzey,n/a,16/08/2025,Wayne Rooney was simply one of England's greatest players .Here we have a insight into this legendary world class figure .A leader on the pitch through he's relentless will to win every ball and chase back like no other striker before him Wayne Rooney in the first half of he's career had a engine on him like no other player I've witness in a Manchester United and England shirt . Rooney was simply a world class phenomenon and I for one hold Rooney alongside the all time greats of football history .,False
18,5,Self-conglaturatory Revisionist Rubbish,kennygow,n/a,16/08/2025,A very fine footballer but no-one outside of England would have considered him the best player in the world. Too much 'look at how well I've done in spite of my flaws' and very little insight into why he felt he could behave so badly yet believe the world was still impressed with his talent. Hints of all too prevalent footballers' in general sense of entitlement throughout.Musical score tries too hard to convince us to take even the most trivial scenes seriously.The makers know their market but 'Rooney' is no 'Zidane'.,False
19,8,A glimpse of the greatness and the tragedy of Wayne Rooney,henry_intheuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary that chronical the story that is Rooney, depicts how a boy, turns into a man, turns into a leader, and becomes an inspiration. His greatness on the pitch is contrasted against the catalogue of mistakes off the pitch, but it is without a doubt that he is one of the greatest footballers the world has ever known. Something also depicted with grace and subtlety is Collen's role in his life, a women who originally was seen as a privileged WAG, however it soon becomes clear that above all she is a wife, a mother and woman. Her performance in this documentary either deserves an Oscar, or she truly carries the pain of what she has had to endure over the many years. It is not her strength that shines through but her vulnerability, a reminder that millions of women across the world also have to deal with the stupidity of their men. Running away, taking the kids, revelling in his millions is the easy option, an option that lesser women would have taken, Collen is not weak, foolish or naïve, she is a women with the same strength as Wayne, she is a mother with a greater commitment than Wayne and she is a wife with greater loyalty than Wayne.",False
20,9,Excellent documentary,SpideySwag,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well done and well made. Gives you great insight into rooney's rise to stardom and his legendary career. Coleen and he also talk very openly about all his troubles off the field, which I didn't expect. Would recommend. Much better than most football documentaries produced recently, i.e. Neymar on Netflix.",False
21,3,It's hard to make an interesting documentary about such a boring man,Ruskington,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wayne Rooney is without doubt one of the best footballers of recent decades but as a person, he is quite astonishingly dull.This is footballer cliche talk taken to a whole new level. There actually seems to be a complete detachment between the words coming out of his mouth and the look of vapid confusion in his eyes. Throw in some incredibly drab interviewees such as David Beckham, Rio Ferdinand and Steven Gerrard and I often felt my eyelids wilting with fatigue.While there are some interesting moments in his career, the events of his personal life are just plain awful. It was particularly difficult seeing his wife squirm through questions about his endless infidelities while Rooney stares helplessly into space.A Wayne Rooney highlight video on YouTube is well worth a watch but overall, this is not a 'personality' worth making a film about.",False
22,10,Absolute corky of a documentary film,wedfan-52803,n/a,16/08/2025,I watched Rooney documentary film on my sky q today and it had excellent in depth interviews with Colleen and Wayne Rooney into the life of the Everton and Manchester United fc legend and I liked clips of euro 2004 were Wayne made his name them clips were he scored two against Croatia in 2004 was so breathtaking amazing for a good player at the time and i liked the interview with Sven Goran Ericsson he was so interesting and knowledgeable about Wayne Rooney pre World Cup 2006 foot injury when Rooney nearly got miss the tournament in Germany and I highly recommend people to watch this documentary film.,False
23,9,Highly would recommend!,wilfredlola,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't often bother with documentaries. But I was a big fan of Rooney growing up.So I enjoyed this alot, its nostalgic as hell seeing all his main football highlights. And hearing his side of fame , and his life in general.Which to be fair he's very honest about to!Quite sad to how he was spoke about at just 16 , I remember some of those rumours!Man if I would of had that kind of fame, attention, pressure at 16 . I would of definitely made some mistakes to.Think most of us guys who grew up in quite rough areas was just the same 🤣🤣🤣I was a man united fan, and actually became a fan of Rooney when he was starting off at Everton. Then obviously the euros I remember so well.I assumed he'd probably go Chelsea at the time. So I was genuinely shocked and excited when it was announced he was coming to united!And remember that first game he had with his hatrick.You just knew right then we were going to come back on top. And with him an Ronaldo . Wow did we just !! 👑 👑 🏆 🏆 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🙏",False
24,3,lame and dull,JonanthanNewOrleans,n/a,16/08/2025,"I turned it off after 30 minutes , i've watched a few documentaries about celebrities and big athletes and i simply think the quality of this one is below average, and actually doing a documentary on Rooney is ''over rated'' , even if he was a very good players there are dozens and dozens of players who are at least as good as him.3/10.",False

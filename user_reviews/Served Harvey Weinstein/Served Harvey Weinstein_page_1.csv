1,7,An informative piece on Weinstein's downfall,Rodrigo_Amaro,n/a,16/08/2025,"An hour special summarizing the rise and fall of Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, going from his high-profile production of countless award winning
hits such as ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Good Will Hunting"" and the major Oscar problematic with the winning of ""Shakespeare in Love"" against ""Saving Private Ryan""
(thanks to his immense campaign with Miramax) right to his downfall after many
denounces of sexual harrasment and rape coming from several young actresses he had contact with, in what was supposed to be work meetings that went to a
erratic behaviors and unwanted advances. The film briefly tells about his power of influence and how for many years he managed to get away with murder with
his actions. And thanks to him and his acts, that a widespread movement (MeToo) gained international attention from social media and rose to the streets
demanding punishment for the sexual abusers in all kinds of industries, from the entertainment, sports, television and other walks of life.For the more curious on the whole affair this doesn't provide much, I think there's better out there that I'm yet to see (but I'm hoping for the film
version of the story, that I heard was on talks). For those who know little or almost nothing about Weinstein and his trials in 2020, this is a fine and balanced project featuring
good interviews with some of Weinstein's victims and others in Hollywood who talk about the importance of the MeToo movement and how the accusations against
him and others truly led a new wave of righteousness, fairness and better treatment of women in the industry. It sure changed a lot how we view abuse and
harassment, and people were aware that some things shouldn't be tolerable.If you haven't touched the Hollywood news outside of entertainment in the past couple of years, than you'll be pleased and informed with this nice
piece on an outrageous character whose legacy got washed away thanks to his acts behind closed doors. Almost nothing new under the sun, we know this kind of
things happened ever since the Golden Era of Hollywood but trouble is that Weinstein, Spacey, Louis CK and many others got caught and exposed. Times change.7/10.",False

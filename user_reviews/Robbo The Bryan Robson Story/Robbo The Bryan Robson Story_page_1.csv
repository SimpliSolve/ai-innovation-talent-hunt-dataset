1,8,Captain Marvel,davidjanjames-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"You forget just how good this self effacing warrior was, I'm an Albion fan and of the right age to be able to remember his 9 years at the club, he took on teams and beat them (with some help from the rest of the team obviously) the 78/79 season I fervently believe we would have won the league if there had not been that delay for the weather, and that primarily was down to Robbo who at the time was considered the best player in the English League!A similar but bigger comment comes from Gary Lineker who is convinced that had Robbo stayed fit we would have won in either 1986 or 1990 he was that good and that important üëè",False
2,7,"Bit of a puff piece, but great old football footage",phil-205-629777,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bryan Robson was my hero as a kid and the reason I supported Man Utd, so I was interested to watch his story.Amazing career, superb goals, Captain Marvel - no doubt. Trouble with this film, even with the end of his managerial career, it's just a puff piece, exaggerating his achievements to almost god-like proportions.Noticed he was exec producer. Would have been better with a bit more of an editorial eye, made independently.Mind you, that all said, I loved the old footage, seeing the great goals and footage of life and times in the 70s, 80s and 90s.",False
3,9,A legend from Manchester to Boro,leeboyapplegarth,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bryan will never have to buy a beer in Middlesbrough ever, he will always be welcomed, a true legend and true gentleman of the greatest game on earth. This is a great documentary of a true footballing legend. Thank you Bryan for the magical years at Boro.",False
4,9,Not bad,mcarticlep,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerGood watch but the way the people in the documentary act like he was the greatest player ever. Laughed so hard when Gary lineker said that England would have won the 86 or 90 World Cup if he never got injured. Then when he was voted uniteds greatest player ever which is a joke ahead of the King Cantona & Giggs banter.,True

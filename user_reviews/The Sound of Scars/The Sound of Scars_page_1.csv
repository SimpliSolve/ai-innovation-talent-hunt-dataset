1,8,Deeper than usual rock doc,NickKnack68,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was never a big fan of Life Of Agony, despite having seen them many times as they often played with some of my faves. But this doc gave me a big respect for them (they truly lived up to their name) and Mina's story is quite intense.Gritty, honest, and at times uplifting, here's a look at a hard working band full of likable members who all have something relevant to say. Loved the old footage from Lamour and was great to see LOA playing in front of some huge audiences.",False
2,7,Sound of Scars,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFormed in the summer of 1989 by singer Mina (born Keith before coming out as transgender in 2011 and transitioning) Caputo, bassist Alan Robert and guitarist Joey Z, Life of Agony grew from a hardcore band that traveled the east coast to build a following to charting at No. 27 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart with their song ""Weeds"" before Caputo left the band.Life of Agony re-formed with Caputo singing in 2014 (although drummer Sal Abruscato was replaced by Veronica Bellino for 2019's Sounds of Scars) and this film shows the journey that the band has taken, with Caputo statin, ""We've never avoided tough conversations and we don't pretend to have all the answers. But this film is a roadmap with many great lessons. It shows a ton of vulnerability...moments of falling downward, and those times where we rise strong.""""A lifetime's worth of struggle and triumph led to the making of this film,"" added guitarist Joey Zampella. ""This release is something we'll be forever proud of.""I remember talking to fans of the band when Caputo transitions and how they were surprised, but metal fans can be more accepting than most audiences. The film doesn't hide from this moment in their history, nor in how Caputo's family is still trying to change with the transformation.The entire band shares how they've used the band to escape domestic violence, substance abuse and depression over nearly thirty years of playing.Director Leigh Brooks also made Terrorvision: Wired Up and Scary, which showed him and an intern on the 20th anniversary tour of that band.You may or may not be interested in this band, but their very human story, as well as the ways that adulthood has allowed them to better connect with their families and approach painful situations with open hearts is quite interesting and well-made. I didn't expect to remain as invested as I was throughout and am please to report that the running time of this movie flew by. It's a powerful film.",True
3,8,Not the typical metal/rock documentary,MehdiTaba,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a deep documentary about couple of musicians and their journey through domestic violence, abusive parents, drug use, alcoholism, negligence, ... and how they are trying to express those feeling through that kind of music and after all of these, Mina Caputo's struggle to come out as a transsexual and the amount of pressure, pain and doubt that people from this kind of community are dealing with.The footage were well chosen and edited, soundtrack was very good and the whole documentary was almost very good directed and made.The humanistic side of each of them that you are about to see is something that makes this documentary unique and inspiring.7.5/10.",False
4,10,Wonderful film,siobhan-01566,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary delivers so much more than expected. Cycles of abuse and human resilience, friendship and transformation are all handled with real care and sensitivity by the director Leigh Brooks, all to the backdrop of Life of Agony's musical journey from the 90s to today. I didn't know the band before watching the film but am a new fan. I highly recommend this film. ðŸŒŸ",False
5,10,An amazing human interest story,jason_mair,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not knowing a whole lot about the bands music and the impact it's had on their fans over generations, I absorbed the movie more from a human interest perspective. The direction and editing transforms the film into way more than a band movie.The story of each of the band members and their struggles with domestic violence and sexual identity separate this movie from any other band documentary I've seen.The director Leigh Brooks covers the topic of Mina Caputos transition with compassion and depth but doesn't make this the entire focus of the movie. It's very much a collective piece about the entire band with great insight into their individual backgrounds and struggle.Check it out, you won't come away disappointed, whether you know the music or not.",False
6,10,Incredibly glad I gave this a chance,owen-kell,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary really doesn't relate to a genre of music I'm particularly familiar with or particularly like, but I'm very glad I took a punt based on the reviews and gave it a shot.I found it an incredibly heart warming journey relating to the challenges in life that many of us face.These are fundamentally great people, often dealt a pretty hard hand in life, who have rode the waves of trauma that have hit them through their lives and come through the other end.A genuine, heartfelt piece of work that touches on so many important emotions including depression, friendship, loss, trust and forgiveness.Highly recommended.",False
7,9,Soul of a band,me-lasierra,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have always been a fan of Life of Agony. I love their very particular style, which does not properly fit into any music label, and at the same time fits many, their profound and heavy music, the desperation and darkness of their lyrics. We saw Keith become Mina and how the audiences remained faithful to the band regardless of gender. My tribe made me proud there.But I never imagined the band had this huge soul, revolving around family, suffering and friendship. They are good people that transforms all that into art, and it is wonderful to see the authenticity of their music.The documentary reflects their musical soul, and it is more dramatic than musical. I'd liked more of their music on it, but as with the band, their personal stories and their relationship goes beyond music.More fan than ever.",False
8,10,Astounding!,smmurr-11780,n/a,15/08/2025,"First Off , If music touches your soul, and you are indeed a human being alive in this day and age...you Just must see this documentary!!! Yes basically its about the NY ""Heavy/Rock"" Band Life of Agony... BUT SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT! There is absolutely no pre-requisite here to be a fan of this genre of music, or live concerts, it will NOT matter!!! Guaranteed IMO! It honestly feels too short, but the journey it takes you on, with the members of this band, the families, friends, business associates, the highs and lows, just brutally raw, honest, and full of humanity in the end! Just an incredibly moving 90 minutes that should not be missed!",False

1,9,"A wonderful movie that will make you sad, happy, and somber",jneiberger-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Lithuanian friend of mine asked me to watch this. She knew I would like it, and I did. I loved it! I had never heard this story before, and I was too young when it happened to know anything about it.But after knowing some Lithuanians and actually seeing the KGB prison for myself a few years ago, this movie really hit me hard. I wish everyone in the ""western"" countries would get to know some Lithuanians or anyone else who lived under the Soviet Union. When you get to know them and their stories, it makes you appreciate what we have here, despite our faults and problems.",False
2,10,1 h 24 minutes of astonishing fate,akvilet-533-884838,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a brilliant movie it is! If anyone gets an opportunity to see it, grab it right away!!!The story itself is unbelievably shocking. I cried feeling the pain, the guilt, hope, kindness of people... I laughed a lot - the hero of the story has an amusing personality and snappy sense of humor. So many emotions in one place.As Lithuanian born in independent Lithuania, I am surprised I have never heard of this story. My farther mentioned that he heard ""something"" about it during soviet times, I believe because the soviets didn't want people to be inspired by S. Kudirka.Critic J. B. Spins writes: ""It was called the U. S. Coast Guard's ""Day of Shame,"" but it brought out the best in America."" What a wonderful thing is to give a hand to a human that is reaching for one. This one person made an outstanding revelation on what life is like under the iron curtain.The way the story is built, the details - it is just marvelous work!",False

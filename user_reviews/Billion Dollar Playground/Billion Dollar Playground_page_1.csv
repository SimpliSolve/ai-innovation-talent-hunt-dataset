1,10,"Funny, real and insightful",LC-06,n/a,16/08/2025,A rare glimpse into the life of the rich and famous and how the staff handle the pressure. All the staff have a unique input into the team and the drama is great. Some really funny moments too. You end up feeling quite sorry for the staff as they are asked to do the most ridiculous things. I have watched 4 eps (waiting on the 5th) and I'm really enjoying it. Will definitely be watching the rest. It's a very similar vibe to below deck except it's on land and the houses change every 2 episodes which keeps things exciting oh and the guests change too! Which I really enjoy. Can't wait to continue to watch!,False
2,5,Below below deck,tahitilooksnice,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show's trying to be Below Deck, with staff and guests in land-based luxury accommodations. However... it feels like the staff were just recruited off the street for the show. No-one is professional or exhibits the knowledge, efficiency and finesse you'd expect when attending to high-paying guests. To be honest, the guests also seem quite awkward too.If I was a guest paying thousands of dollars a night, I'd want a professional discreet butler and staff, whereas this crew are loud and love making themselves the centre of attention. It's hard to figure out what they actually do. The housekeeper seems to work her butt off, the chefs produce too, but the rest all want to be in charge. Maybe they're really just all wannabe actors playing roles.",False

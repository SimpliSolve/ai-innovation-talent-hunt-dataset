1,6,At times touching but falls short lacking in details and needed information,omega145,n/a,15/08/2025,A rather short documentary at about 45 minutes but even then feels a bit too long. There just isn't enough information related to the medical diagnosis or treatments and the focus falls a little too much on the parents taking care of the child. The film may have been better served by focusing on the medical issue at hands AND talking more on the problem world wide in helping children with birth defects.,False
2,6,Sickness Awareness,jorge_lina,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIs mostly about sickness awareness... But I question the final part, which seems more macabre than anything else.
I understand that the kid dies at the end, that it can happen despite all efforts to help her life quality... but still showing the corpse was totally unnecessary...",True
3,10,Heartbreaking,dr-harsha-mv-56,n/a,15/08/2025,Roona's story shatters you but reminds you to be hopeful and grateful. World is still a better place with so many kind people to help. Netflix doing a good job to showcase stories like these. Thankful to the parents to tell their story.,False
4,10,True love doesn't need a script.,kishore-61683,n/a,15/08/2025,True love doesn't need much. Just someone to tell it's story. Roona was loved unconditionally by many. And is the untold tale of many more families who boldly and silently bring up children with birth defects. How lucky am i.,False
5,10,We Don't Understand How Privileged We Are In A 1st World Country,ruadhcaileag,n/a,15/08/2025,"Roona. What an amazing, beautiful, strong, wonderful, unbelievable little girl. We don't know how lucky we are to live in 1st world counties where Hydrosephylitus (can't spell) can be helped at birth. Her Mom, I can't even imagine how heartbreaking things were but yet she is so beyond committed to Roona, she is an inspiration.
Moms, it's so hard to be one. But we do so much love our children. A inspirational story. A beautiful story. ðŸ’•",False
6,n/a,Compulsory Viewing,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"For me i sometimes must be shocked into reality so that i quit complaining about how things are so unfair for me in my world.
A documentary that immediatly arrests me for all the right reasons and remakes me into who i want to be.
If anybody else wishes to benefit as I have done then i encourage you to watch it",False
7,5,What a horror show,danagailbowman,n/a,15/08/2025,"This poor little girl would have been cared for and given surgery so much faster if she was not a girl. The fact the mother says her brother hits her, a completely captive and not able to move human being, and laughs about it says everything. They delayed surgery for over a year for what??",False
8,10,A lens into third world ignorance,lmsa50,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA great film. So sad how the parents always thought after surgery she would become normal. She had some level of blindness due to the constant nystagmus and of course with no speech year after year, it's obvious the kinder thing to do would be to let her pass peacefully.",True

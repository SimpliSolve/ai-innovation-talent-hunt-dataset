1,3,Clueless rich people,lillegards,n/a,15/08/2025,Just another clueless out of touch rich family signing up to be in a pointless reality tv. All pretending like they've earned anything of what they have too much of. Gross.,False
2,2,Could of had Potential,jaceniamedina,n/a,15/08/2025,"What makes a documentary good is the conflict resolutions. Seeing struggles and over coming them that are relatively relatable. The struggles of these girls, many of us wish was all we had to deal with. They are extremely privileged the parallels to normal teens don't equate. I understand Gen Z might really be the focus but this really sets unrealistic expectations for our youth. And I if I drank every time I heard ""like"" & ""I don't know"" you could ring me out into the Nile and fill it up.",False
3,4,Perspective,askeriemann,n/a,15/08/2025,"It gives a good perspective into who their life is now and how it was before their fame. The game has definitely changed them. When you watch the show it's easy to see that their life seems like a lie. Their friends aren't real friends they are just people who are famous. Maybe they don't want to show their more personal relationships to the world, but from the show's perspective it seems as if their whole life is fake.",False
4,1,JUST LOG OFF,TastyReviews,n/a,15/08/2025,"Let me start by saying I sat and watched EVERY minute of EVERY episode of this show. I'm not a fan of this family, and I think some of the business practices they have employed are disgusting; all previous opinions aside, it is clear these two girls are hurting, especially Dixie.You can see the impact that moving to LA had on these girls - I wish there was footage from before the move, but you can see how fake everyone around them is (from their close ""friends"" to agents and employees). It's all a bunch of Yes-Men surrounding these girls - perhaps to try and counteract all the hate they receive, but more clearly to make $$$.These girls are responsible for confronting the hate they receive due to their celebrity status while the managers, producers and most importantly their PARENTS sit behind the scenes essentially dealing with none of the backlash from controversies that arise.If the parents of these girls REALLY cared about them, they would tell them to LOG OFF. They've clearly already got millions, more fame than anyone could ask for - why do they need to remain in the limelight??? They cry and moan about the abuse on social media all while continuing to use the platforms that provide them ""social anxiety"". I understand that it is their family business, but if I were a parent seeing my child struggle I would not sit by and watch just for a quick buck.TLDR
Moral of the story here is that Charli and Dixie are clearly spoiled and get more affected by LA culture every day. Charli seems incredibly fake, stuck up, judgemental, etc. And is clearly surrounded by people who are the same. The worst offenders are the parents, who allow their child to suffer mentally while neglecting the truthful advice their daughter needs.",False
5,1,Pathetic,hzwhbyrq,n/a,15/08/2025,"Honestly this show was pathetic. They are just looking for people to feel sorry for them. Honestly like if they are so worried about what people have to say about them turn off your comment section or delete your account, do something about it or stop whining about it. Take responsibility you chose to get into social media did they think they were gonna be perfect with no negative reviews? ITS SOCIAL MEDIA. Stop being naive. Maybe if your getting so much hate there's some actual logical reasoning to it and some truth behind it and people can call out the bullshit. Literally every episode is the same thing over again. Very annoying and cringy. Talking about how they have so much work to do and never have time, and complaining about it, like no ones forcing you. Be grateful for what you have. Most people out here are less fortunate. Sounds like ungrateful snobs to me. Not genuine at all. The way they perceive themselves on this show is not how they perceive themselves on tik tok. Charli acts like a complete cry baby on the show but on tik tok acts like a slut. I don't get it. Completely fake. Cringe worthy acting. Both of them are very over hyped. Will be irrelevant in a few years.",False
6,1,None of these people have talent,nookies-23849,n/a,15/08/2025,"I remember when in order to be rich and famous you had to at the very least be talented. When the Kardashians first became a thing they were mocked and laughed at. ""Famous for being famous"" was generally what was said. Now the bar has gotten even lower which is mind blowing. We're now giving reality shows to teens that gained followers poorly lip syncing and dancing and all they could do is do it for 30 seconds.This show basically sums up everything that's wrong with social media and society today. Social media has bred nothing but rampant narcissism. If we're going to make people rich and famous, can't that at LEAST be talented?",False
7,1,Confirms Everything I Already Thought,matthewtessnear,n/a,15/08/2025,The D'Amelio Show confirms everything I already thought about these TikTok teens. This show is uninteresting and often cringe-inducing. I couldn't watch past 10 minutes. It's just a feeder of the conceited and egocentric focus of social media and entertainment culture.,False
8,1,Vapid Reality TV,swordsnare,n/a,15/08/2025,"There is nothing 'brave' about this First World Problem TikToker. It is the sign of the true degradation of entertainment when they're making reality programming around a narcissistic app 'personality'. This is not being harsh, this is true 'reality'.",False
9,1,Why did they make this?,avyanmatt,n/a,15/08/2025,Trash plz never watch this garbage they made it for the paycheck.,False
10,n/a,I'm not a massive fan for the D'Amelio family but this show is actually very inciteful,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show perfectly represents the stress these two young teenagers go through. This show brings some important messages to people out there who post hate comments, or bring shame to influencers. It is really hard to be an influencer because it is a job, it is a full time job, these people are put under so much stress and pressure because of haters.Overall it was actually very interesting to see how many things this family does. If you're a hater than just don't watch the show, all you're gonna do is hate on such a great reality show. It's kind of a must watch because it really is great to see.",False
11,9,Definitely worth a watch. People are being unkind!,bjrixson,n/a,15/08/2025,"Really enjoyed this. I didn't know who they were before I watched this but it was interesting to learn about the lives of these TikTok stars. They suddenly become famous from posting videos and then have to navigate there way through it all including people that just want to be nasty.The amount of abuse these two teenage girls are having to endure, simply because they are in the spotlight and are discovering how best to use their platforms is disgusting. Even on here on IMDB the comments are uncalled for. Why do people choose to be so unkind to other people.This series was an attempt to take people on their journey with them and to highlight the amount of bullying and harassment that social media stars have to endure. I found it interesting and enjoyed every episode. I wonder how many watched the whole series before commenting? I wonder how many even watched an episode? If you don't like it or them, that's ok but please think before you're nasty.Easy watching and interesting if you want to know who this family is.",False
12,6,Reality tv,sarahidlt,n/a,15/08/2025,"I do think there is an element that is missing from the show, that could be due to editing or
directing. Yet, the show in itself showed a very interesting part of social media work.That third person that is in every gen-zer mind, that judges everything we wish we could do or do
before we even do it, isn't talked about enough and it plagues the mind of so many people,
especially young people.I believe this show served as a creator of empathy, and if you couldn't see that while watching it
and the effects that negativity and rudeness have on people then just omit your comments all
together, it's not for you. You can critique and still be constructive and positive, yet that's
something people have a very hard time doing.This show proves the effect that one ""brave"" troll can have on a person's well being, and I thought
that was powerful in itself, and the negative reviews from this show prove that people refuse to
learn and think we all need to hear their negativity just because they can share it.",False
13,1,Hulu should feel shame,Hitting841,n/a,15/08/2025,Watched as a joke as i knew it would be terrible and it was absolutely that. This should be scrapped right away. I don't like knowing my subscription fees goes to funding this garbage.,False
14,1,Not interesting,lold-01227,n/a,15/08/2025,Nothing much . They tend to show off too much and the girls are trying too hard. Nothing much just boring........,False
15,1,Why,ovaatum,n/a,15/08/2025,We got so many reality shows for rich people who do absolutely nothing for society. If this gets a second season then you can stop the earth cause i wanna get off.,False
16,1,People need to stop watching this Garbage,revieweranarchy75,n/a,15/08/2025,And everyone wonders why society is so stupid.... Tik Tok is the worst thing to ever happen.,False
17,1,The boring show,deenatawee,n/a,15/08/2025,The show is too slow processing plus a lot of boring moments. Yawning a lot .....yawn yawn yawn.,False
18,1,This show is bad all around,anthonypinero,n/a,15/08/2025,"The D'Amelio family: they are fake, they are boring, the acting seems forced, and their ""love"" for each other is fake.The parents: they are just there to ride a long their kids ""fame"", they suck at parenting, and the mother gives me the creeps; she acts like she's the most beautiful person in the room. How about getting some botox tales of the crypt.",False
19,1,why tho,billykflow,n/a,15/08/2025,"They are complaining about cyber bullies and being put down but the same premises made them famous and rich, if you dont like the feedback you get, either dont read it or get off it. They could do anything but this show and it shows u how desperate they need attention and sympathy. I have none for u! U have more opportunity than most.",False
20,1,Another american family *hit show.,rjh224568,n/a,15/08/2025,After full of crazy and dumb show about family earning through tallentless kids and botox here comes another show where you can view the dumbest generation of america performing their oscar level acting.,False
21,10,Shows the reality of social media,amazingsarahawesome,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's very obvious why everyone hates on them , they have the ""perfect life"" money, houses ,family and a job that allows them to have fun.This series shows that their life is so much more than that , these are humans who are struggling. This is a very sad 16 year old girl . No amount of money could fix this . Compassion and love could help .People compare their salaries to doctor and say they are not deserving watch this series and tell me the negativity they receive from millions of ppl if u could handle it. My respect for them is over the roof.I hope charli can find happiness bc it is clear she has had that stolen by millions of jealous trolls . I cried .",False
22,7,It delivers what it's supposed to,alicewilliams-71091,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have watched one episode, I don't know much about this tiktok thing/family, I knew they were tiktok famous and I was just watching out of curiosity.What I do not understand is the hate those two young girls get, they seem like two sweet human beings, that got famous from tiktok and trying to get the best out of the opportunity. Which I think most would do, if they made it. And the youngest sister do dancing on a competitive scale and the oldest sister can sing okay, but she gets lessons to get better. So they have some talent.It is sort of an interesting series to watch, because you get a perspective of what they want to do, with the fame they got. They know of fragile it is and it seems like they are working hard to break through their tiktok image.I gave them 7 stars, because it delivers what it's supposed to, and a alot of the bad rating come from hate, which they don't really deserve.",False
23,1,i dislike this show,nyansushi,n/a,15/08/2025,"The dogs were cool doe

if charli has another panic attack i hope she dies low key
dixie needs to come to the realisation that her boyfriend is in the closet

24,1,Tears for them poor poor multi-millionaires,vmackey777,n/a,15/08/2025,"Don't you just hate it when talentless multi-millionaires, who made their money in the most lazy ways, are sad? I do. And watching this show was heartbreaking to me.If you feel like watching self-absorbed spoiled teens and their enabling parents self-pitying in the most cringey ways, after famously acting in the most disgusting ways in real life, to the point of putting people in danger in foreign island because they felt like taking a vacation in a tropical location in the middle of a pandemic, this show is for you.I always thought that no form of entertainment could be worse than what Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian had brought us in the past two decades. I was so very wrong. So, so very wrong.",False
25,1,why does this exist,sundeepsmail,n/a,15/08/2025,Your better off watching a ruby rose movie and i wouldnt recommend that to my enemy.,False

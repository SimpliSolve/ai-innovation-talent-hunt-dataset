1,8,"Funny, entertaining, learning experience",bjhayer,n/a,16/08/2025,"A comical look into the Indian culture through humor and relatable experiences. Material, presentation, flow and timing are excellent. Zarna is intimate with her audience and delivers. I want to see more of her. I love the delivery. I like how her material isn't dirty but fun, real life experiences and then seeing her family on stage dancing. I had some difficulties with her accent but I understood almost all of her material. Zarna explains bits and pieces of Indian culture that I always had questions about. Dinner's at the Garg house must be interesting. Zarna touches on real life experiences that transcend culture. Her Americanized children are no different than anyone else's. She even tells mother-in-law jokes. We aren't that different after all.",False
2,10,Untold angle,BrijG-0,n/a,16/08/2025,"Zarna Garg attacks an angle of comedy that we have never gotten before. The Indian aunty. Such unique jokes nobody else could write. Such unique and talented humor. She especially makes mother in law jokes in which she complains her MIL is too favorite of zarnas husband. The first time I've truly seen a comic introduce and create a family brand. The end might have been the best part because of how unique it is. It has funny jokes throughout the credits and a tasty treat for the audience. I don't think I've ever seen a special like this and I hope to see many, many more. Thank you Zarna Garg for such an incredible hour.",False
3,10,Laughing Through Logic: A Review of Zarna Garg: Practical People Win,chiomao-30331,n/a,16/08/2025,"Zarna Garg: Practical People Win is a comedy special that showcases the sharp wit and cultural insight of Indian-American comedian Zarna Garg. In this performance, she uses humor to highlight the realities of being a practical, immigrant mother navigating modern American life. Through stories about her arranged marriage, raising kids in a different culture, and balancing tradition with modern expectations, Zarna delivers punchlines that are both hilarious and deeply rooted in truth. Her comedy reflects her identity as a woman who values common sense and resilience, proving that practicality, especially in the face of adversity, is not just useful-it's powerful.",False
4,3,You are funnier in short form content,Reviewermadam,n/a,16/08/2025,"Listen.. I'm going tos tart by saying I'm a HUGE Zarna Garg fan! Watch all the podcast episodes and her interviews and her Instagram! I think you're hilarious in reels but I wish I could say the same about your standup specials..I went in with high hopes and high expectations but realized a lot of the jokes are sort of stale.. the whole MIL bashing and immigrant problems just don't feel that funny anymore.. it's like we say in Hindi- ghisa pita jokes. Also very dated views on India (maybe it's just a generational difference..I really don't know because I'm an older millennial who came to the US 10-12 years after you), but I could not relate to a lot of the jokes in the special.But when I watch your reels where you play almost therapist and roast your kids and husband you are hilarious and I watch them over and over and get a laugh out of those!",False
5,10,I told everyone I know to watch it!,AnaisD-0,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was laughing out loud thought out the whole special. It was so relatable and unique at the same time, we need more of these stories told. I loved hearing about the oldest daughter as I could relate so much! I sent the special to everyone in my family and told them to watch it! It was so amazing to see so much culture and love.",False
6,5,Are all Indians this shallow?,1maginary_Friend,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched most of another one of Zarna's specials on Prime and felt this one was pretty similar. She's funny for about the first half, but then the voice and the repetition of her jokes kind of wear on you.I have absolutely zero culture or heritage, so I love getting an inside glimpse into the lives and thoughts of people different than myself. Unfortunately, Zarna's portrayal of Indian priorities revolve around status and money and it's incredibly off-putting and depressing. I'm not looking for wholesome or preachy... just depth, maybe.It's great to see a proud American Eastern Indian getting some limelight, but I wish her content had more substance. I'm definitely not interested in watching any more of her specials.",False
7,10,So funny,ulianasharapova,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't think I would laugh this much, but wow! This show was so funny and easy to relate to. She talks about things like family, kids, and everyday stuff that totally happens in real life, but makes it way more hilarious. I watched it with my mom and we couldn't stop laughing. If you want to be in a good mood, you should watch this.",False
8,10,Zarna is Comedy Gold!!,GiaV-97,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow!! Zarna really outdid herself with this new hilarious special!! Her unique sense of humor really captures the audiences attention.

She truly made every scene exciting , definitely worth your time and laughs. 10/10Not only that but the quality and angles they filmed and captured is very impressive.

10,10,Zaina Garg is a must see!,Sanya-06,n/a,16/08/2025,"A clever and novel interpretation of Indian culture, vividly shown through incisive humor and realistic narrative. The content of Zaina Garg is intelligent, well-written, and highly relatable. She easily engages the audience with her flawless timing, flow, and stage presence. Her emphasis on reality, which demonstrates that being practical isn't dull but rather effective, is what I adore most about her. You feel like you're part of the joke and part of the moment when you see her. And when her family participates, it's endearing as well as humorous. I'm eager to see her again. With each of her jokes, Zaina demonstrates that sensible people do succeed.",False
11,10,Absolutely love it!,VeronicaM-39,n/a,16/08/2025,"Zarna Garg's Practical People Win is a laugh packed and heartfelt hour that perfectly captures the chaos and charm of immigrant family life. Her jokes about Indian moms, practical parenting, marriage, and kids are spot-on, it's like watching your own life, but way funnier. She's real, and totally relatable. You'll laugh, nod, and text your mom immediately after.",False
12,10,Loved it,SommayaH-8,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't usually watch comedies, however, I decided to tune in to Zarna's special on Hulu after seeing a friend post about it. I already follow her on Instagram but this had me and my mom laughing over and over. I really recommend watching this special with your family. I guarantee it will make you laugh out loud!",False
13,10,Felt Like Laughing With a Friend Who Gets It,ReginaB-80,n/a,16/08/2025,"Practical People Win surprised me in the best way. Zarna Garg has this natural way of making you feel like you're sitting across from her at a kitchen table, just cracking up about life. Her stories about marriage, kids, and family stuff hit home....like really hit home...but she never makes it too serious or too silly. It's the kind of humor that feels honest and familiar, especially if you've ever juggled cultural expectations or just tried to keep your life from falling apart. I didn't expect to laugh as much as I did, and by the end, I felt like I'd just spent an hour with someone who sees the world the way a lot of us do...but knows how to make it hilarious.",False
14,10,Love it,IssauraR,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was actually really good. The message is clear: being practical doesn't mean being boring it means winning in real life. Definitely worth the watch.Is very funny and authentic
Make me laugh a lot.I can watch many time and I don't get bored, I can recommend to this to anyone who want to get entertainments.",False
15,10,Nails it every time,imdbfan-200390,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched Practical People Win after loving Zarna Garg's first special One in a Billion, and honestly, she's just so funny and relatable. She talks about marriage, kids, work, and all the little things that drive you crazy in everyday life, and somehow makes it all hilarious. I laughed out loud more than a few timesðŸ˜‚. If you haven't watched either of her specials yet, definitely start with this one, but the first one is just as good. She's super underrated and totally worth watching.",False
16,10,Loved it,PrinceC-232,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched Zarna Garg's Practical People Win on Hulu and I had to come here to say-it's amazing! She had me laughing non-stop. The way she talks about family, culture, and everyday life is so real and so funny at the same time.What I really liked is how personal it felt, like she was just telling stories to a room full of friends. Even if you don't share her background, you'll still relate to so many of the things she says. Plus, the jokes hit every time!",False
17,10,Super enjoyable to watch!,AnanyaK-932,n/a,16/08/2025,"Zarna's comedy is so relatable, real, and funny in this special! I loved tuning in. It has been a total joy to see Zarna perform live in NYC before and this special does a really good job capturing how special, heartwarming, and fun her comedy shows are -- definitely recommend watching with friends and family.",False

My family and I sat and watched one night and there was laughter the entire time. As many of our family members are immigrants, we can really relate to a lot of the situations Zarna speaks about in the show!",False
19,10,See it with your family,cathgulick-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was lucky enough to attend the premiere screening at the 92nd Street Y. The audience was exploding with laughter again and again at some truly unexpected takes. I used to think Zarna was more benign and safe but she has a truly wicked sense of humor, including the nonchalant way she deals with some really dangerous-sounding haters! I'm still laughing and reciting the jokes to my friends and I don't understand how she packed so much into an hour. Everything was effortless and perfect. The show ends with a dance sequence from Zarna and her husband and kids! Do yourself a favor and see it with your family.",True
20,10,The only therapy you need!!,sanak-830,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched Zarna Garg's Practical People Win with my husband who's not a desi boy but loved this Indian comedy. Absolutely love all the fun she added to our evening Hulu binging. Her show is like therapy but cheaper, funnier, and your mom would totally approve. My favorite part is the MIL jokes!!! If you haven't seen it yet run, don't walk. This will definitely make your day.",False
21,10,watch it now!!,DhritiR-0,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really loved this show. I binged it and thoroughly enjoyed it. As an indian american, i also related to some bits. Its on hulu, therefore you can get a free trial. Its 100% worth signing up. Love zarna garg's comedy and glad she's trending now! My family and i absolutely love her and her humor!! Go watch!",False
22,9,Golden!!,cek-89985,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am such a fan of Zarna, because she has great comedy craft. She nails her zings, and she calls it like she sees it. She is also very authentic and leans into sharing the intricacies of her culture. She doesn't take it too seriously and she in invites in the audience. For me that is two fold benefit, Indian people will relate but it also let's outsiders in to the humor and understanding of the relationships and views in Indian culture. I think her message will resonate with people embracing diversity in cultures. A second wonderful special!Go watch it, you'll love it and be rooting for Zarna!",False
23,10,Hilarious,CarlosC-511,n/a,16/08/2025,"Zarna Garg crushed it with Practical People Win! It's funny from start to finish, but also has those little truths about life that make it feel real and relatable. The timing is perfect, and it never feels forced. Easily one of the best comedies I've seen in a while definitely worth watching! 10/10!",False
24,10,Incredible and hilarious,ShahrikaT,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been eagerly awaiting this special since I saw the trailer and let me tell you, it DID NOT DISAPPOINT. I grew up watching immigrant children base their comedy around their experiences as immigrant/second gen children raised by immigrant parents. Zarna comes in to fill the opposite end of that genre -- the immigrant parent! She does this with such a charm, I can't explain it but I am so fond of her and her comedy. The way she sets up her jokes is brilliant and more than once I was caught off guard by her punch lines. I really recommend that everyone give this special a chance!!!",False
25,10,She Does It Again!,MckenzieP-06,n/a,16/08/2025,"Zarna Garg's new special is hilarious in the most real way. Her jokes about being a mom and an immigrant are so honest and relatable without trying too hard. It just feels natural, like you're listening to your funniest aunt. This is one of her best works yet, and it shows. Definitely worth watching with your friends or family!",False

1,7,recreating misery in hopes of healing,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Goodness, this review has been so difficult to write. Not because of anything wrong with how this documentary was made or filmed - in fact, from a technical standpoint, it is very well done. Rather it was due to my personal opinions and bias, which were what I had to fight against while watching.Filmmaker Cecilia Aldarando makes the decision to relive her 1990's adolescence, and to film the proceedings. The tagline reads, ""She's doing high school again"", yet it's really more than that. This plays like a deep therapy project centered around her admission that she didn't fit in, and to this day remains scarred by memories of PE class, crushes on boys, school bullies, and prom night. Ms. Aldarando still carries the anxiety of not being admitted to the ""in"" group of girls from whom she so desperately wanted acceptance.Timed to coordinate with her high school reunion at the Country Club in Winter Park, Florida, there is actually very little footage shown from the event. Instead, much of the time is spent on reenactments designed to recreate painful and vivid memories. Cecilia also meets face-to-face with her high school crush, Joel, who barely remembers her and had no idea that she was silently pining for him. She even reads him a poem from her 1994 journal, making the encounter that much more awkward.Bad memories are a fact of life after high school, and most of us learn to live with these and move on. Cecilia Aldarando needs closure, and one of those horrific memories is recreated by selecting young actors to help re-live a night at camp where, Jo Anne, the one girl that was treated worse than her, was humiliated by the same group of girls Cecilia so wanted to be like. Making this segment more impactful is that she had tracked down the adult Jo Anne to provide input and observe. It's a tough scene for us to watch, and especially tough for Jo Anne.Cecilia even includes her real-life partner, Gabe, as well as her older sister in reenactments, some of which work better than others. The Tori Amos video segment seemed to drag on longer than it should have, and the ""My So Called Life"" piece was a bit creepy. Cecilia's long ago best friend Caroline is discussed frequently, and it's clear that Cecilia views her own failures as a friend as a critical element in telling her story. This is likely the most revealing aspect of the process for the director.""Hating"" one's self during the teenage years is not uncommon. What we hope is uncommon is the need two decades later to address the misery of those years. Cecilia's sister asks the question that needs to be asked: why does she give the past so much power? The film was co-directed and edited by Sarah Enid Hagey, which was necessary due to Cecilia being on screen for most of the film. It is interesting to note the role movies played in childhood, and how so many of her crushes were directly from period pieces (aka unattainable). Home movies are included here as well, and Cecilia admits the desire and need to exorcise those adolescent demons. We are also left questioning the accuracy of those long-ago memories, which here are explained as bad memories containing specific details, while good memories are a montage of the times. Here's hoping most of us dwell on the montages.Available on HBO beginning November 8, 2023, and streaming on Max soon after.",False
2,7,"Starts out slow, becomes something beautiful and moving",paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""You Were My First Boyfriend"" (2023 release; 97 min.) opens, we are introduced to filmmaker Cecilia Aldarondo, who has nightmares reliving her high school years back in the mid-90s. We then go to ""Winter Park, FL"", where Aldarondo attends a high school reunion. Things might eg awkward... At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: even thought this is co-directed by Cecilia Aldarondo and Sarah Enid Hagey, this is really the story of Cecilia. The movie starts out slowly, almost to the point where I was considering to bail on it, but then something magical starts to happen, and the documentary picks up steam (and beauty and empathy). For some, this still may not be enough and they cannot overcome some cringe-worthy passages in the film. But by the time we come to the enactment of a ""My So-Called Life"" scene, and then the Tori Amos video ""Crucify"", it all made perfect sense to me. Kudos to Cecilia Aldarondo for having the courage to share her feelings with us.""You Were My First Boyfriend"" premiered at this year's SXSW festival to immediate critical acclaim. I read a good review of it in the NY Times last week, peaking my interest. The movie just started showing on HBO and also streaming on Max, where I caught it the other night. If you are in the mood to reflect what it was like to live through adolescence, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
3,9,I truly heartfelt genuine authentic film,ptnvk,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a hard-core Gen Xer, this movie hits so deep!It's a unique meta-layered documentary type format that starts kind of slow but picks up in pace and obscurity. It encapsulates all the sweetness and confusion of first friendships and young love, teenage angst and all the in-betweens.90s musician tori amos said that adolescence is the scariest place on earth. This film encompasses that very feeling of how moments you create in your youth can shape you for a lifetime. And if you're a Tori Amos fan you are in for a VERY special treat.I also love the attention to detail for the 90s scenes.I also loved all the home movies. You get to reminisce on those days when there were no cell phones or social media and everyone just was having a good time.Cecilia wasn't afraid to color outside of the lines on this one. It's funny, heartfelt, and incredibly moving in so many ways. It made me laugh, (hysterical crying laughter in some scenes!!), made me nostalgic, moved me and just made me feel.Bravo Cecilia and team x.",False

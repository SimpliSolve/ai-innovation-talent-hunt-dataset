1,8,What a crime thriller should be,cricketbat,n/a,15/08/2025,"I like it when a movie can keep me guessing until the end, and Gone Girl just did that. Most of the time I didn't know where this film was going, and each new twist and turn was a surprise. You can't help but get pulled into the story. The actors all gave excellent performances, as well. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at some of them the same way again. This movie is what a crime thriller should be.",False
2,9,"Mixed feelings, hear me out.",cmalpelli,n/a,15/08/2025,"There's no denying that this is a great film and from what I've heard a great book as well, you can see that I gave it a 9/10 rating, but there's a catch especially for me personally with this movie. The shorts version I can tell you and with my hand to God no lie this movie single handedly put the nail in the coffin for my marriage without me even being the wiser. So for as much as I do appreciate the detailed and intriguing story, watching it years later after my divorce it sends chills through my body knowing that my ex wife and I enjoyed this movie together, and obviously me not knowing just how much she loved it but how it inspired her to go about divorcing me in the way that she did, be weary because there are sick people (men and women) in this world that will vindictively assassinate someone else's character and well being just to avenge whatever perversion that they're transfixed on in their own mind. I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, I'm just stating a fact that happened to me, I don't advise watching this for the first time with a love partner, it could unhinge the mind beyond a point of no return, I'm absolutely 100% serious about this, this is not a joke.",False
3,7,"Good movie, reflecting witch hunt mentality in social media/TV",johaschrei,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI never wrote a review before in my life so please excuse my poor attempt, but after reading some of the reviews I just felt I had to give it a try.I really thought this movie was very good. It's starts as the typical ""missing wife, husband main suspect, no body yet found"" tale we all have seen once in our lives. But after the first act it really gets extremely unsettling and special. I felt sick in between because of the horrible, frightening character of Amy. I can't describe it any further and think you should simply give it a try.SPOILERS!!!!I now would like to address certain plot holes many people have been pointing out.First of all, every movie has plot holes. I'm usually the first to notice, and even though there were some things that bothered me I got over them quite quickly since the movie had a tight grip on me.Many are mentioning to different cameras in Desis house. First of all I know that many surveillance cameras overwrite their data after some time, so it is very likely that only the last few days (where she never left or entered the house) would be available to the police. Second of all, as far as I could see, the cameras only showed the outside of the house not what was happening IN the house. That's why she went near the window, which was within the perimeter of one of the cameras, to do her screaming attack. If you pay attention, you never see Amy appearing on any of the cameras when she checks them, only when she actually wants to be seen.I could address many other so called ""plot holes"". I don't think they actually were plot holes per se, but made intentionally in order for us watchers to go...""But wait, how does she get away with this??"". Think of the police officer who is in doubt of Amy's statements or even the lawyer.What Fincher in my opinion wanted to demonstrate is the exemplary control Amy had over the public, were no questions were asked, nobody ever doubted her. It is kind of symbolic for witch hunts we ourselves have witnessed on TV or social media, were no second opinion is sought, nobody looks at the story from a second angle. Amy is the personification of the American Sweetheart, and is treated as such. It just shows us how blind and angry the crowd gets when you push certain buttons, Amy herself actually talks about that in the car scene. The pregnant intelligent wife, who was cheated by her husband. Or the poor girl next door who was always nice to the strange kid. Or the rich guy who thought he could have everything.That is basically the story and that's why this film is so intriguing in my opinion. It's a mirror of how our society in the age of internet, social media, TV etc. functions. How we can be tricked into anger or sadness, and how little people actually question certain statements.",True
4,10,"A Cynical, Masterful Caricature of Modern Relationships",manisimmati,n/a,15/08/2025,"Amy and Nick Dunne are young, stylish and charming. The immaculate dream couple? It seems so, at least on the face of it. But infidelity and financial troubles let the glamorous façade crumble. One morning, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick becomes suspect. Did he kill his wife? The media depict him as an uncaring husband, and he's trying desperately to correct that image. But what if he really is the murderer everyone believes him to be?""Gone Girl"", based on the Gillian Flynn novel of the same name, is a masterful thriller, a sharp-sighted media satire and a cynical analysis of modern marriage. Flynn herself wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation, and David Fincher turns the already disturbing story into something even darker. ""Gone Girl"" is a perfect fit for Fincher, as it is concerned with two of his favorite themes: gender issues and modern media. The main topic here is how the media are shaping our own identities. Nick Dunne has to adapt to the expectations of the public in order to survive. As his lawyer Tanner Bolt puts it: ""This case is about what people think of you.""Amy and Nick both just play a character. They pretend to be a perfect couple. The movie suggests that pretending and being are not as far apart as we tend to think. When everyone plays along, the shallow masks are going to work. The much-maligned ending underlines this insight perfidiously. It's the point where ""Gone Girl"" becomes a pitch-black social satire. The last act isn't a thriller anymore, it's a grotesque caricature of modern relationships. I've never seen anything like it, and I can't praise Fincher enough for the risk he took with the last half an hour of this movie.Ben Affleck is great as the insipid husband Nick. You love to hate him. Rosamund Pike is simply mind-blowing. You'll also see Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry in unusual roles. My personal favorite is Carrie Coon as Nick's caring yet foul-mouthed sister Margo. She's the heart of this movie, because unlike everyone else, she genuinely speaks her mind. Kim Dickens as the clever detective Rhonda Boney is pretty approachable, too.""Gone Girl"" might be Fincher's most splendid masterpiece yet. This movie is so unsettling and cynical, it feels like it was directed by the love child of Alfred Hitchcock and Lars von Trier. If that's not awesome, I don't know what is.",False
5,8,Great film but the ending was terrible,kingdoz,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm not one for reviews, but I tremendously enjoyed this film but felt empty at the end of it. That ending was shockingly bad, such a let down to a great film. Still worth watching but you will end up cursing the writers, producers and perhaps even the actors for that low quality ending. Even if the story was written to end this way, it could have been communicated far better and with far more realistic excitement. It seems like they just plonked it at the end rather than continue the story. What the hell happened? Did they run out of time or needed to release it by a specific date or did the original scriptwriter run off? The end the film was not of the same quality of the rest of the film and left me feeling shortchanged.",False
6,8,Interesting end,bgar-80932,n/a,15/08/2025,This is a 2.5 hour movie and sometimes these days it's difficult for me to stick with the longer movies but this never felt long. You were always curious what was going on. Let's just say it didn't quite go the way I expected but I was intrigued the whole time. The acting was great. This could for sure be considered a slow burn and I'm actually currently watching the TV show Sharp Objects by the same author and this is paced much better than that. There's a couple things I didn't particularly thing got solved or like how they went at the end but overall a great movie.,False
7,8,"Gone, but definitely not forgotten",bowmanblue,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow, actually a thriller that's pretty good. Yes, it's fair to say that 'Gone Girl' is a really engrossing film. As with almost every film, it's based on a book. And, as with most films based on a book, I haven't read the book, so I haven't got a clue how well the film relates to the source material. But then I don't care. I just enjoyed the ride.'Gone Girl' is one of those films where you don't want to say too much about for fear of giving things away and spoiling it for people who haven't seen it. Ben Affleck plays a (reasonably) decent husband whose well-to-do wife disappears. The media circus that follows then starts to reveal that the truth is far more complicated that it first seems (not to mention the obligatory police investigation). It's fair to say that what follows is a film that twists and turns, so you only really get one chance to watch it and not know what's coming.Many people don't really like Affleck when it comes to acting (even less now he's due to don the Batsuit!), but I think most people will relate to him as he gets pursued and hounded (unfairly? You'll have to wait and see!) by the media. Rosamund Pike plays his (gone!) wife with a flawless American accent. Again, you'll have to see whether she's found alive or dead. The story bounces around back and forth in time, making sure you're just confused enough never to put too much together before the film's ready to reveal what's happening.If I had one complaint it's that the film is a little too long. Perhaps ten to fifteen minutes could have been edited out at around the three quarters mark, just to speed it up. But that's a minor gripe. Basically, if you like your thrillers twisty and turny (and have a couple of hours to spare on a film that you really have to concentrate on) give this one a go.",False
8,8,Crazy!,freshclean-66-318608,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film wasn't as bad as some people say it was. It was actually good. It was a pretty nice psycho thriller. It had me guessing at times and there really weren't any dull moments. This film was well done with just enough suspense to keep me interested. The acting in this film was great as well. Now, I'm not a big fan of Tyler Perry's films but his acting is good. He had a wonderful performance in this film playing Tannor Bolt, Nick Dunne's (Ben Affleck) lawyer. He was really perfect for the part. For me it was kind of weird seeing Neil Patrick Harris playing a serious roll as the crazy ex boy friend of Nick Dunne's (Ben Affleck) wife, Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). Rosamund Pike and the parts she were in were well done! I mean she pulled that roll off! Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) was allegedly killed by her husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck). From the beginning Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is the suspect and the craziness starts from there. If you like mysteries/thrillers you won't be disappointed with this one.",False
9,10,Shock and Awe,LiamCullen6,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHow on earth is this film attracting so much criticism?! This is one of the best films of 2014 and people are labelling it ""utter tripe"", ""an enormous heap of illogic and nonsense"", ""wish I had missed it"". Are these people serious? Can we no longer appreciate - or even identify - a great film?!Gone Girl is a peerless plot-driven story about a wife who goes missing. Seems pretty ordinary, right? Well it's not. And it doesn't take very long at all for any sane viewer to recognise this.You start watching and - as you do with any mystery - you start collecting the clues and piecing together an explanation for the events which have taken place. But no sooner than you have formed the perfect explanation in your mind is it immediately swept away in the most overwhelming twist of the year.And it only gets better from there.Gone Girl is a roller-coaster; only you're riding it in the dark. You don't know where the next turn is, you can't see where you're headed, and you have no idea how many more ups and downs you're going to experience before it's all over.It's a film that keeps you guessing and just as you're beginning to (once again) think you've got it all figured out, the game changes and it's all up in the air once more.The diary-exposition format is also very clever and was executed perfectly. Many films fall victim to losing the viewer when jumping back and forth between past and present, yet Gone Girl - you guessed it - does it just right.This film ranks high in the mystery/thriller genre. It is just as compelling and perplexing as Shutter Island - if not then moreso.And let's not forget: the acting. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike do a phenomenal job in their roles as husband and wife. Not a line feels out of place and both seem as though they were born to play Nick and Amy Dunne. By the end of the film I felt so immersed in their story that I found it hard to believe it was just a film.All in all, I for one am thoroughly pleased with Gone Girl. I knew from watching the trailer it would be something I would like, I just never imagined it could thrill me this much.A very underrated and overwhelming story that should be enjoyed by all.",True
10,6,The Diary,pambosk-03254,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerGone Girl received a lot of praise when it came out. Here i am now watching it for the first time ten years later.To me , it was just an ordinary thriller, granted the first 45 minutes were excellent. Ben Affleck comes home to find his wife Amy missing ( Pike ), and over the course of the next few days he is accused of killing her.Things go well until the second half. Three things let this film becoming just an also ran.1. The police find the diary of Amy in the furnace of Affleck's father's house.???? Inside the furnace was clean with only the diary slightly charred, come on people. If you really wanted to get rid of this diary by burning it, would you not stay and make sure it was burnt to a crisp? How did he supposedly start the fir.2. Amy is rescued by an ex boy friend. Who has a house with security cameras everywhere. She was there for a number of days and the police didn't see that in the tapes, and how come the ex did not see Amy doing things to herself on his cell phone.3. At the end of the film the police never ask Amy how she found a cutter to kill her ex when she already told them that she was permanently tied up when she was left alone.Too many loop holes....sorry 6/10.",True
11,10,Slow burner with a twist for the ages. Fincher does it again.,BoxOfficeKid,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe first act of the movie is the run-of-the-mill wife gone missing, the husband accused of killing her plot. This is clearly established in the theatrical trailer and may have thrown off some potential viewers. To the people who are familiar with David Fincher's work, this is not the case with Gone Girl.Yes, the first act is very ordinary, but the second act uproots whatever ever considered dull about the movie as it takes a rapid turn into thriller stardom, resembling something taken out of a Hitchcock movie. Only a handful directors can completely enhance the movie's narrative through editing, and Fincher is one of them. I know there is a lot of praise around Rosamund Pike's performance, which makes it easy to overlook Ben Affleck. He plays the tired, oblivious and boyish really well. This may be the very reason why he is completely overlooked.And in a time of sequels, prequels, remakes and biopics, finally a contemporary piece of work! Stellar!",True
12,6,So disappointed in the ending!,Megk92,n/a,15/08/2025,There was good acting and it's a good story. It built up really well and then fell flat at the end. I'm honestly a bit angry about the ending. So unsatisfying and annoying. They did a good job of making you really hate Amy though. Wish I could say it ended with a bang.,False
13,1,Am I watching the right film???,chelseapithiya,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm utterly confused...after so many good reviews and the film being uploaded on Netflix (and Ben Affleck, enough said) I decided to watch it.I'm not sure if I'm totally missing something, but there are so many plot holes in this movie. And I don't mean like tiny ones you can overlook, but supermassive black hole plothole types. I cannot actually believe it was so close to winning an Oscar. Absolutely shocking.These are the things that just did not add up (I'm not a CSI, I just have a brain and logic):1. Why did he not divorce her years ago?2. The puddle of blood is a very neat little murder. A blow to the head (as the detectives think) would have left splatters everywhere.3. Would Amy not have struggle against Nick? If she did struggle and Nick had murdered her, there would have been nail marks, bite marks, bruises on Nick's body, sure signs she struggled. This should be the first thing detectives look for on the husband/partner of someone who goes missing - not intimacy marks but wound marks.4. If the bat thing was the murder weapon, there was no mention of Nick ever touching it!! They can't pin the murder on him unless they can prove the weapon was in his hand. There were no fingerprints left on it etc.5. How did Amy sneak in all those gifts to Margo's house without her noticing? Also, does Margo just have her shed permanently empty and not visit it ever?6. CSI could've very easily done some sort of DNA test for any skin residue etc left on those pants in Nick's office. This was left with no explanation.7. How did no neighbours see a car/Amy's body being dragged out by Desi/Nick?8. If Nick had done the murder, why would he not bother to properly burn the diary? Or just rip out some relevant pages? If Desi was guilty of kidnapping & raping, what reason does he have to burn the diary? How would Desi get to Margo's house? Does he even know Margo?9. Nick has a crystal clear alibi with people who can vouch for him and no-one saw him at the scene.10. Why did she bother making friends with those people at that motel or wherever she was when she should've been laying low? Also a totally rubbish identity change from Amy's part. Her 'intelligence' (or so a poorly executed representation of intelligence) should cover that, no?11. At Desi's cabin, would there not have been CCTV footage of her coming into the property, completely without a fight, and a fair few days after her abduction? Would investigators not question where she was between that time?12. What about the CCTV of Amy and Desi happily having dinner together, watching TV etc?13. What about the CCTV footage of Amy going into the bathroom without any ligature marks on her wrists, to magically appear upon her exit of the bathroom?14. Why would Amy not run out of the house or call the police when Desi leaves the house?15. Why would there be no wounds from Desi's abuse on Amy's return?16. There was no investigation on Desi's crime scene, they just took Amy's word for it.17. Blunt force trauma wounds do not heal fast - Amy would've had the original 'kidnapping' wounds upon her return. Why did they not investigate this?18. If the investigators actually did their job, they would've cleaned her up and looked for evidence to match her story to. Instead they sent her home, dripping head to toe in her kidnapper and rapists blood for the press to get some meaty footage. Logic.19. If Nick is totally out of the suspect list, which he was by the end, there was nothing stopping him from divorcing her. Apart from maybe a bit of hate mail. Nothing would've kept me married to Amy after that.I could go on, but I've already wasted enough time by watching this film. Also, Amy just needed to stop with that accent.",True
14,9,"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players !!!!!!",avik-basu1889,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have always been a huge admirer of David Fincher. He is undoubtedly one of the most consistent and masterful storytellers in modern cinema. I also think when it comes to dark, disturbing thrillers, there is very few who can match the directorial skills of Fincher.Like many of his previous films, Gone Girl is a very long film, but in a true Fincher-esque fashion, it is as engaging as possible without any scope for the viewer to feel bored. The pacing is perfect. The scenes have a dreamy style to it, which brings the dilemma of ""whether this is a true account of things or has this been made up by the narrator.""The theme of the film is the fact that humans at the basic level are all actors and pretenders. Very seldom do we decide to be our real selves. Generally all of us put on a mask to make ourselves look good in front of the general public and also to pretend to be the person that our nearest and dearest want us to be. Gillian Flynn's screenplay based on her own novel is brilliant and it is also a damning indictment of how media can shape and mould mass perception and it is also a cynical account of the institution of marriage.Ben Affleck is good, Tyler Perry is good, but this movie from an acting perspective belongs to Rosamund Pike. She owns every scene that she is in and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.Fincher has once again has made a fantastic film. The last 30 minutes might not be completely logical, but it is still symbolic. If you are about to get married,stay away from Gone Girl.",False
15,n/a,"Dark And Twisted, Full Of Great Visual Storytelling",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dark and twisted, David Fincher's stylish new mystery thriller was derived from Gillian Flynn's intriguingly slick tale from her complex and suspenseful novel. By far one of the best acting performances to have come from Ben Affleck, 'Gone Girl' boasts some strong yet disturbing portrayals from Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Affleck. Fincher has garnered fame and recognition as a mainstream director, that is not only able to engulf the audience within the picture, but actually make them part of the scenario. Fincher exercises upon his trademarks with the swift and stunning cinematography, the chilling score and tight editing, all of which makes 'Gone Girl' a movie full of great visual storytelling.",False
16,9,Another David Fincher winner and one of the year's best,TheLittleSongbird,n/a,15/08/2025,"David Fincher to me is one of the most talented directors around today, and while Se7en from personal opinion is his best film Gone Girl is up there with his best. Fincher directs with his usual superb class, giving the film great style and keeping the story alive(Gone Girl is easily one of the year's best directed films), and the whole film looks absolutely great with brooding lighting that evokes the creepy atmosphere brilliantly and Gone Girl is also a film that makes good use of digital, after seeing many directors over-using or cheapening it it was refreshing to see the technique done with taste. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score gives the film a haunting vibe and adds much to the unsettling intensity that a lot of the film(at least two-thirds worth), managing to not do it in an in-your-face manner. The use of sound mixing was interesting and came off cleverly, almost like a distant thought process. Gone Girl also has a brilliantly written and adapted script that does a great job balancing dark humour- that's not overused and is often hilarious- and suspense mystery (The Cool Girl monologue in particular is a masterpiece of script-writing, one of my favourite film monologues ever), while the story(apart from taking a bit of time to get starting) is absorbing from start to finish, rich in detail and characterisation and is filled with shocks and unpredictable twists that will be guaranteed to leave you reeling. That it is adapted from superb source material(one of the best books I've read in recent memory actually) helps it, and that it is faithful to it is commendable, a case of being faithful to the source material actually coming off wonders rather than being bogged down by being too faithful. The not-what-they-seem characters are incredibly interesting and richly developed, especially Amy who is one of the most chilling female characters of the year. And the acting is one of the high points of the film, as good as Fincher's direction and the score are it's Rosamund Pike's knockout turn as Amy in restrained- she only has to raise an eyebrow or something like that and it says a lot- but quite terrifying mode(especially in the third act) that makes the film. It will be a great surprise if she isn't at least nominated because it is easily her best performance. Ben Affleck has the other not-what-they-seem role and plays it with oozing charm and brooding intensity, while Neil Patrick Harris surprisingly excels in a very against-type role(who knew he could be sinister?) and Tyler Perry oozes charisma and is very funny. Carrie Coon is the standout in support, it's a tricky role and the moral compass of the film but Coon is touchingly likable in it. The ending does for my liking end too suddenly and the storytelling got implausible and lazy at this point, but apart from that Gone Girl was a winner and one of the best of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox",False
17,8,Perfect example of a modern day thriller,mar00481,n/a,15/08/2025,"David Fincher has done what i thought was the impossible, by making a movie from a book, and it actually being good, i'm even going to say better than the book, and i don't give that out lightly.First off, the use of sound within the film, both diegetic and nondiegetic really sell this film to me, it does a great job in unnerving us as an audience and its just a little off, if i looked at the score of the film, i wouldn't be surprised if it comprised of tritones (For those who don't know, tritones make music sound just that tad off), and the synth sorta sound reminds me a lot of Alex Forrest's signature tune from ""Fatal Attraction (1987), Adrian Lyon""The Story is fantastic it really shows the disconnect between people in the modern day, and how the media influences everything so strongly.In Summary this movie is a great watch, and if you enjoy the genre, or just trying to put together pieces of a metaphorical puzzle you will enjoy this movie.",False
18,8,Unique and darkly funny,toppin,n/a,15/08/2025,"Two movies for the price of one.That's a fairly glib start to a review of a movie that I really liked, but it is true. The first half of Gone Girl is a fairly standard ""did he or didn't he"" mystery thriller. Then, about an hour in, the perspective shifts entirely and suddenly you realise that you're watching – perhaps – the most pitch-black comedy that you've ever seen.Despite the abrupt shift, I still think that Gone Girl holds together extremely well as one whole movie. Ben Affleck's Nick manages to inspire sympathy without ever being truly likable while Rosamund Pike's Amy (the star of the show in my opinion) is brilliant, terrifying, hilarious and despicable in various combinations and occasionally all at the same time.David Fincher's direction is both classy and clever (as usual) and several scenes are particularly outstanding due at least as much to his brilliance as that of the actors involved in them. My one complaint would be over the length – it really didn't need to be two and a quarter hours long. There were certainly a few moments, particularly in the first half, when I wished that the movie would hurry up and get to the point just a little more quickly.Gone Girl is a movie unlike any that I've ever seen before and as such largely defies further description. I would recommend this movie to all (with a warning that the adult rating is well earned) but especially those with a dark sense of humour. The darker the better.",False
19,8,The Horrors of Domesticity,Serge_Zehnder,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe basic premise is as old as the movies.An abduction leads to a media-circus.Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes home one day to find his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing. The ensuing search and all the subsequent events, which shall not be revealed here, draw the viewer closer and closer into a complex world of everyday suburban reality and everyday suburban horror.As if it needed to be pointed out, this balance of reality and horror, or horrendous reality, is the domain of Mr. Fincher. In his clear-cut no-nonsense style he has fashioned a powerful mystery-thriller that lands somewhere between Hitchcock, Lynch, Bergman and Chabrol. Although vastly different directors, they have shared an interest in dissecting reality and human nature.Profiting from two exceptional lead actors (doubts about Mr. Affleck's acting abilities will hopefully be dispelled), it is Ms. Pike, who reveals herself as an immensely versatile and unpredictable force in this movie. Over more than ten years Ms. Pike has played big parts in small movies, or small parts in big movies (such as Pride & Prejudice"", Wrath of the Titans"" or Jack Reacher""). Under the guise of Mr. Fincher she excels in every aspect and if any contenders for awards are to be named so early in the season, hers would be one of the first names (next to the outstanding cast of Richard Linklaters Boyhood"") to be written down.Visually stunning as one would expect from Fincher, with an immersive soundtrack by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross and an editing rhythm that cuts like a knife through the tissue of the story and its characters, Gone Girl"" leaves no doubt about its craft and the deceptive nature of its source novel by Gillian Flynn. The author adapted her book into a tightly wound screenplay, that adds fuel to an already burning analysis of modern marriage and human frailty.The themes are familiar to Fincher, but he assembles them in an expertly fashion. And we are left wondering, amidst the suspense, about many of the so called estimable American values of the 20th century, that have now come crashing down under the weight of an economic, political and spiritual crisis.",True

22,10,If Fincher was looking to out do himself...he has succeeded.,trublu215,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gone Girl marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.",False
23,6,It's all over the place!,mellotr,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI love a good Thriller, and when theirs a really good one, it's a smart movie for the people who analyze the movie and didn't see the end coming, and continues to make you think. This movie falls way behind in that category. Really? Ben couldn't have just walked out? Court order for DNA of the ""Baby""? Their are so many holes on how she tried to frame him, I could rate this as Swiss cheese. It was interesting at times, and you did want to see what happens next. However that lead to a anticlimactic ending. It's to bad it had a lot of potential.",True
24,4,Too Many Loose Ends,ajaysinghjaswal-133-244502,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have not read the book so I cannot compare this movie with the book. But judging from the fact that Gillian Flynn has also written the screenplay of the movie I trust that the movie has done justice to the book. Which might not be a very good thing to say about the book because I wasn't very impressed with the movie.Please don't get me wrong, I like David Fincher's works. He picks up off-the-line subjects and execute them very well. Sometimes he also leaves loose ends. Loose ends are not bad because sometimes they get the audience to think more than what the movie is trying to convey. Unfortunately, this movie has too many loose ends and turns. The movie starts as a psychological thriller then turns into a treasure hunt with well-planted clues which are easily understandable; then into a war between a smart psychopath wife and a clueless husband. In the end, the movie turns into a common hate story of a husband and a wife.What surprises me in the movie is that the wife is a smart psychopath, the philandering husband also gets there gradually, being smart. But the general public, media and FBI are just dumb. How is it that FBI is not able to understand that a man gets enough time to go to his father's house to burn the diary but does not have enough time to burn it completely and still leave pages which can get him caught? How it is that FBI cannot find the missing wife? Now I am not a detective but I do know the general modus operandi of any detective agency - keep a tab on the previous acquaintances of a missing girl. Might not be a bad idea to pay a visit to one of her ex-boyfriends and Viola, there she is, living a good life. Found and case closed. More surprisingly, when the missing wife has decided to come back nobody even wants to re-look at the clues that she had planted against her husband. After all, everyone had started to doubt him. The list does not finish here. How come the camera at Desi's house can only catch her alone, evidently tortured. But there is no video of Desi actually torturing her. But no one wants to ask these questions to the wife. Only a few questions and FBI just lets her go. How come doctors forgot to check her so called bruises which she was supposed to have when her husband was supposedly dragging her?So there are too many loose ends. Is it that the makers of the movie think that the general public both within the movie and out of the movie is so dumb? Within the movie, the general public thinks of the husband as bad guy when the wife is missing. But when she is found nobody is questioning her motives and now the poor-dead-ex-boyfriend is a bad guy.On top that, there is a supposedly smart lawyer (Tyler Perry) who is of no help to the husband besides making few funny comments.On the good side, Ben Affleck and Carrie Coon still managed to be convincing. Rosamund Pike is Okay. But that's the only good part I could see.All in all, I am a little disappointed with David Fincher. Se7en, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button were really good movies and had given its audiences lot to think about. Unfortunately, this movie does not do that besides giving message that every man is a sex maniac and women are psychos. What surprises me the most, the book and the movie are getting good ratings.These are only my opinions but if you still want to watch it please go ahead. After all it is your money. It does have few funny moments.",True
25,8,Good fun for those who like twisted humor.,johnny-burgundy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gone Girl (2014) This is a psychological thriller set in Missouri.The mystery surrounds a man who becomes the main suspect in the sudden disappearance of his wife. The film was praised by critics and audiences alike. It received multiple award nominations. The casting was superb. Rosamund Pike received an Oscar nod as the wife. The first hour sets the stage. Then the fun really begins. Good fun for those who like twisted humor. Regardless, it's really entertaining. The way it ended is priceless.",False

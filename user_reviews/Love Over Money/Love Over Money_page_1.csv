1,8,Fascinating Story,Sil-Azevedo,n/a,16/08/2025,"John Robbins is a brilliant person who made bold choices as a young man and it worked. He renounced wealth and privilege out of conviction and led a much more interesting life than he probably would have as a mega-heir to the Baskin-Robbins empire. This film is simply a sit down with John as he tells his story for 1h42m.I was surprised at how rudimentary the production was. B-roll is dull, repetitive (we see the same photos over and over again), and the acted portions (to illustrate scenes in John's relationship with his dad) are poorly produced. The actors look nothing like the people they represent and even the ages and body shapes don't come close. In the hospital scene, the actor looks like a healthy middle aged man, representing a 90 year old man dying of cancer. He wears cheap glasses whereas all the photos indicate Mr. Robbins always wore designer glasses, little things that make the illustration not work.All that aside, I could not stop watching for one simple reason: John is so well spoken and his story so compelling that I could sit for hours and just listen to him. Thankfully the sound is very good and the scene of John speaking is well filmed. Would you take two hours of your time to sit down with a brilliant man and hear him tell his story? If so, this film is for you.",False
2,10,John led such an interesting life!! I'm so jealous,seankennedy-65373,n/a,16/08/2025,"John Robbins really led an interesting life. It's really cool how John stepped away from his inheritance, didn't let anyone know who his dad was, then was still able to get fame in his own right through his compassionate book (as seen in the trailer as well). I read his book a while ago and it had a really profound impact on me; I was shocked when I found out later his dad was the founder of Baskin-Robbins.He also looks like he's in amazing shape for a 77-year-old; I'm 37 and I hope I'm still alive when I'm 77, let alone looking as good as John! Seeing a man who lives his convictions and led such an interesting life is 100% worth the watch.",False
3,10,True love,saritachaube,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a heart touching story of true love. The love which is not just restricted to the boundary of home but the one which understands the pain and suffering of all the creatures. The love which will fight against all the odds and luckily here love prevailed.I hope we have many more John Robbins who can spread this beautiful message of love.The documentary pictured connection between the nature and human beings. At the present moment of war, conflicts and global warming, these are the much needed documentary. If it can make us understand the real love which sees no boundaries, which is fearless and passionate same time then I think yes this world will be better place to be.",False
4,1,A nearly 2 hour ego-stroke for Robbins *yawn*,honeystreetflowers,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a 1 hour and 41 minute long film about a nepo-baby. He had every possible advantage a white American male could have his entire life, and then expects the viewer to buy into the narrative that he moved to another country, purchased a chunk of land in the wilderness, and built a whole house with his bare hands, with no help, no skills, and completely furnished it with no money. And thennn, he got a book published as a first-time author without the clout of his name and didn't capitalize on the controversy of ""denouncing the ice cream empire he was groomed to inherit."" ðŸ˜‚
Give me a break!!!",False

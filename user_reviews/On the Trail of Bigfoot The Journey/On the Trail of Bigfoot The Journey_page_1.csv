1,6,"Interesting, but...",glenndl,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt covers the wilderness of the American northeast region which is fascinating, but that's where the appeal ends for me. Apart from some incredible artwork, a few interesting encounter stories and historical records, it does drag on a bit. They seem more interested in the wilderness that this legendary entity could possibly inhabit than the actual mystery itself.Until we have definitive unequivocal evidence Bigfoot actually does exist, these documentaries will continue to trudge along with the same monotony. All flash. Little substance.",True
2,2,Nice scenery picture is ALL it is worth.,tonyhulkgamer,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSame as the other 100s of bigfoot documentaries. Guys with nothing else better to do. Hey guys, let's go camping! Ok, let's take video showing that we find nothing as usual.",True
3,2,So bad it was entertaining,banditmeerkat,n/a,15/08/2025,"My wife and I thought this was hilarious it was so badly put together; the shooting, the editing, everything except the sound which seemed decent, I was surprised to see a lavalier mic on an interviewee's lapel. I thought they were shooting with cellphones. Turns out they have prosumer gear - just don't know how to use it. It was so badly shot I decided to investigate - turns out these guys are kickstarter funded and can raise as much as $100,000 for a project!As far as the content goes it was okay, probably the worst bigfoot doc I have seen, but there are some reasonable interviews. I guess what might be great fun for the participants may not be as entertaining for the viewers, like your home movies that you cobble together and then torture any unsuspecting victim. Bottom line - buying a camera with someone else's money and shooting in full auto mode doesn't make you a cinematographer.",False

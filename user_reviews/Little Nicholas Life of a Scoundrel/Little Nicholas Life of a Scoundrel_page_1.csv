1,5,Deeply Unpleasant,atleverton,n/a,15/08/2025,"To watch as its main character loves to hear the sound of his own voice, and it is not very clear when he is telling the truth, and when he is lying. He seems to have made a living by making up stuff, and people around him believed him. I'm not sure how we are supposed to take this story - at the centre there seems to be a figure of ridicule, but then there are individuals who are scared to death of what has been uncovered because of this case. The documentary itself is a bit of a waste of time, it deeps no deeper into its main character, although the production values are very high in this. Not recommened.",False
2,7,Always Keep An Ace Up Your Sleeve,PalmBeachG,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well in the end, Nicholas was asked if he is holding something back and he responds ""always keep an ace up your sleeve"" and he recommends it for everyone.I liked it - it accomplished what this kid accomplished as a young teen - with proof from photos and interviews and court records ( however that was accomplished). I see this more as a grooming or adults taking advantage of a kid who just happened to have the connections of well known politicians and upper class owners of business owners' kids through his private school. He was the commoner in the elite school - every elite school has a few. He was noticeably popular and sociable at school and a leader who could get the kids to follow him. He started to get invitations to important parties and was getting used by adults for info - w/o his full understanding what was going on. He was flying in jets at 15 living in the fast lane and a kid that age can't understand fully what is going on. As he ages he matures and starts doing favors and goes up the ladder as a minor quickly -and he learns how to manipulate people way before his 18th birthday. So when does the fact that he was manipulated and used turn into him manipulating and using others? At what age did that kick in? Is he responsible for him loving nice things when everyone kept rewarding his favors with commissions and homes and cars, etc?",False
3,8,Exposes the deeply manipulative world of politics,mapr-02894,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerGreat editing and camera work. I actually liked the music a lot, as well. As far as interviews and research goes, the documentary team seemed to have done some great investigation and documentation work, and I really enjoyed that, specially because I somewhat understand the context of Spanish politics/recent history.Taking that into account, I found it somewhat believable-- in the sense that, in the end, this kid was used as a pawn in a world of greedy and power-hungry adults. In other words, he was basically groomed into doing their dirty bidding. The worst part is that they justified things to him as ""spying"", or at least, that's the lie that they made him believe to get him to do whatever he did.",True

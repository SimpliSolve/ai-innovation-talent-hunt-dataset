1,7,Bronzed,owen-watts,n/a,16/08/2025,"Palin's latest series, each one feels like a baffling gift, sees him newly widowed and arriving discombobulated into the sprawling waterlogged slums of Lagos. It's an ominous start but he regains his energy fast and is back in step after that. Nigeria is a fascinating country to focus on and his relentless humanity is on show as always here, despite his increasingly large entourage of minders, guards and fixers. Again it's more of a whistle-stop tour than his epic journeys of old and you get the feeling he's only really scratching the surface of such a vast and complex country, but there are enough fascinating encounters and strange asides to keep it interesting. Where next? Slough?! Hopefully just Slough.",False
2,8,Michael does Nigeria,safenoe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou're going to either love or not love Michael Palin's journey to Nigeria, and I've never been to Nigeria so really I start from that point for what my viewpoint is worth. Anyway, Palin is respectful to the locals and he doesn't go moaning wishing he had a full english breakfast to start the day. Nigeria is a huge and diverse place no doubt, and my only gripe is that there were only three episodes because there's so much more to explore in this amazing country that defies the western stereotypes. Anyway, I'm hoping Palin travels to other countries in Africa like say Ethiopia, Kenya, Zimbabwe.",True
3,9,Another Interesting Palin Journey,jonathan-spiritualmedium,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another very interesting Palin journey, into what, for most viewers, will be very unfamiliar territory. Viewers will certainly be able to understand a lot more about the country's history, diversity and challenges - both past and present - by the end of the third episode. What also comes across very strongly is that this is a young country, with a predominantly young population and it is really trying very hard to find its feet and place in the world. The people he interviews - without exception - are strong, colourful, vibrant, upbeat and full of hope and determination, something you often find in young, developing countries. It also clearly shows how people with very little, in terms of money and material things, can still happy, positive and upbeat, so much more so than many people in wealthy (or where the wealth is more evenly distributed) countries. It brought back a lot of good memories of the time I spent in Brazil in the late 90s/early 2000s - also a hugely diverse, tremendously positive and energetic young country, with a predominantly young population, looking for its way forward. Palin also did a series on Brazil about ten years ago and, for those who have not seen it, it's worth checking out.",False
4,10,Delightful... and informative.,rwmwybrh,n/a,16/08/2025,'A certain raffishness' .... Of all the faces and temperaments to put in front of Nigeria - this is extreme! The sordid history of African people being captured and sold - and it's still happening! Michael Palin who is known to us for his gentle humour is our tour guide. What a revelation and what a kindly face to tell and confront the people who know. Super sweet and sour entertainment.There can be no way of forgiving the horrors of the 'slave trade' as we know it. The American past and present is unbelievably cruel. What this show seems to present is the possibility that Nigeria is not as shocked as we are. Slavery was in place before and after the Atlantic trade. Islam understood it. Those of us who need to know can look to Michael to explain - if at all possible.As with all good documentaries it's sometimes nice not to be there.,False
5,5,Time to Retire?,GB65,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel that as he's aged, the quality of Michael's travelogues has unsurprisingly diminished with each new series. In his first six major series, when he was engaging with the locals he seemed genuinely interested in their stories and his environment. Here, he looks like what he is, an elderly gentleman looking on in surprise at his surroundings and not really taking in what he's being told. We also had the slavery lecture from him; unnecessary as the lady with whom he travelled to the beach (from where slaves departed) talked so eloquently about it. We didn't need his enforced guilt trip. And while he's here slagging off his own country for events from hundreds of years ago, he cheerily accepts the story about the 35 children fathered by a local 'chief' during the segment in how the Nigerian population is forecast to soar to 440 million within 25yrs, glossing over the poverty that this will cause and the strain it will have on resources. He also cheerily glosses over the beach rule of 'No homosexualism.......gay or lesbianism.' He never looks comfortable here whereas in earlier series he fitted in everywhere despite his obvious eccentric Englishman's presence.",False
6,3,Disappointing,chris-lalor-545-230359,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've loved the Michael Palin programmes and was looking forward to watching this one too even though I had some trepidations about the country of destination, Nigeria. A turbulent country ever since getting its independence almost 65 years ago. I have to say I was very disappointed, I watched all 3 episodes and I'm not really sure what type of programme it was, neither a travel one with Michael's usual touch of humour or a serious political one. It really didn't seem to have any direction or purpose. The one sided presentation of slavery was outrageous. Let's hope his next one is better than this, he's certainly capable of making one.",False
7,1,Atrocious,bertbarrott,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know this country and this parody of a travel show is superficial in the extreme. National Geographic gee gosh american school girl at its worst. Palin has done no homework whatsoever . He adds nothing to the camera. He has read nothing of its history. Knows nothing of its complexity. He frequently and grossly mispronounced names (particularly Kano. Zaria and Lokoja but also Bornu,
Benin and others ). It is both arrogant and lazy not to even attempt to pronounce names properly. Palin should retire. Most of Palin travel shows are
patronising and superficial but this is the worst one I have had the misfo to view.",False

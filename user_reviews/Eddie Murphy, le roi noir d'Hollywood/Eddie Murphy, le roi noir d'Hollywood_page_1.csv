1,5,"Well intentioned, but Eddie deserves better",spankywzl-41026,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary hits all the right points in Eddie's career. But there is something off about the production of this well intentioned outing. My first thought was about the quality being a smidge above that of a Nicki Swift or Watch Mojo youtube offering. I then started to wonder if the narrator was a real person. There are no photos or even any bio information on Aline Afanoukoe in this site's data base, but let us assume she is real. Who wrote what she was narrating? Was it Chat GPT?All I'm saying is Eddie is a gigantic superstar. Even the kids standing in front of brick walls on Open Mic Night right now, owe a LOT to Eddie and what he did for comedy. I was hoping for more from this film, but perhaps that is because I hold the man in such high regard. I'm glad the film got made. I just wish they were able to give us more.",True

1,7,"A watchable series, but yes there are issues.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very dry look at six cases of murder, where the victim was murdered by someone that supposedly loved them.I found the crimes themselves very interesting, some really powerful interviews with family members and loved ones.....and some interviews by so called experts, some of them are interesting, one of them however is dismal, the most interesting episode, is the one about Peter Morgan, it is spoiled by an incredibly biased so called expert.It's very dry, compare this to an American series, and it may seem a little reserved, perhaps less dynamically produced, definitely less by way of sensationalism, maybe not quite so entertaining.I found some of the stories so sad, but intriguing to watch.I would say that if more are planned, there needs to be greater impartiality by the experts.Watchable, 7/10.",False
2,5,"Very middle of the road retelling, but I think the reviews are the criminals here",OneAnjel,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know British documentaries are much different from American documentaries but in this case there is just so much redundancy and so little new information to take up the entirety of each episode. It's really not about British being more reserved, this is sadly just very mundane and reiterates itself over and over. Sad for the victims. I think it's very hard to understand not only the behavior of a stalker or someone of that kind of controlling nature that ends up murdering you because they can't control their emotions but it's equally hard to understand the lack of action from the friends and family who saw the danger far ahead of time. You just can't really know what you would do in such a situation although it's very easy to judge them and wonder why they didn't take some action especially the red-haired girl. The reviews I find intriguing and upsetting, if I can be honest. Who are all these people calling this a woke documentary series and saying that it's sexist? Are they saying that because the murderer was not put in a good light that the show is showing favoritism toward the victim? I think those people need some psychological counseling and I hope that they are not the next stalker. It's absolutely incredulous to me to read reviews that are upset that the perpetrator was shown in an unfair light. I mean the very notion that you should somehow be fair in describing or demonstrating the perpetrator is so mind-boggling that I'm at a loss for words.",False
3,5,Middle of the road true crime documentary series,AdamJACox,n/a,16/08/2025,"The cases themselves are fairly interesting, given a very detailed build-up to the eventual murder so you can really get a feel for the people involved and the narrator does a good job of tying everything together but there often lacks detail of how the actual event transpired (understandable as only the killer knows what happened in each case but it sort of glosses over it in some cases, just simply a they killed them and that's it).There are other issues which lead me to give this a middle of the road rating. Firstly it can be quite repetitive, often repeating quotes or rehashing the story (presumably because it was made for advert breaks and there aren't any on netflix) and the portrayal of the killer/victim seems very biased and one sided. Always describing the victim as innocent and the killer as out of control or psychopathic which may be the case but no way as black and white as this documentary implies.",False
4,2,Repeating/Rambling interviews.,rosstayler,n/a,16/08/2025,"The interviews are painful to watch, filled with useless information and one expert repeated himself continously just rephrasing his sentence over and over. Badly edited and put together what could be put in a 25min to 30min episode is dragged out with useless information while concluding information is just brushed over and ignored. This applies to all the episodes.",False
5,9,Really surprised by poor ratings,Basicpleasuremodel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe it's because most people watching don't understand stalking behaviour. Of course the series is biased towards the victims, they were brutally murdered! My goodness! They didn't deserve to be stabbed multiple times. Makes me wonder about some of these reviewers, seriously. I think the series does a good job of showing the helplessness and guilt of the families. Nobody wants something like this to happen to their loved one, all of the victims were very young (one killed at 20 years old). I also think it does show how these toxic relationships begin and the red flags to look for....but that could have been flushed out more. I wish they had an expert who really delved into the psychology of stalking and maybe what victims and families can do other than feel helpless. Clearly police need to be able to do more as well. I am just glad several of these families have set up charities and trying to help others, bringing something positive out of something so horrific.",False
6,2,Limited. All hearsay and third partys.,aimeecook-93844,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's all just photos over and over the same ones. Pictures of the area and then people sat, talking
Only watched episode one.Why not show their texts? Why not show the photos where they were on hol?Makes interesting stories really boring it needs more of this rather then speculation and hearsay.",False
7,9,true crime,andreimdb38,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story is well described, CCTV footage, there are psychologists analyzing the mental state. Could have more real details like message exchange etc.",False
8,3,too one sided/ no one is unbiased,kdawncr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Now ive only seen the first 2 episodes of season 2,m.The first was decent, but the family/friends/prosecutors are very repetitive and don't do a great job of making you understand the people/places/situations in the least. Also i found this series to be very dry so far. Yay the second episode i found to be ridiculous i had to button down and force myself through the episode. The guy is just as bad as the girl. He is a drinker and a drug user.. from where i'm sitting they are the same.. i understand she did some bad stuff at the end, but seriously this isn't the type of murder you show case and act like he was an angel just caught in a bad cycle. So was she. It's just not a good look the way they are beating how much she drank into the ground and acting like she's trash when he was doing the same EXACT thing. Also she can get an abortion if she wants and she should have seeing as how she couldn't support another child with how her life was going and neither could he. He didn't even have any custody with his child what does that say about him. The uk stuck in the dark ages if they look at single moms wrong but single ESTRANGED fathers like it's not their fault.I can't watch anymore, i like myself too much. Just no, no- absolutely not.",False
9,1,Why is this in the top 10 on my netflix,lilly_oshea,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found the people who were interviewed were either biased or prejudiced.Now i only watched the first two episodes but this is the first show in at least two years that have me mad!The first was told like the directer was a supporter of the taleban. No understanding that the woman was forced to mary. & he could have let her go with dignity for both of them, but he did not.The seconded episode was just as bad, but it was just a western way of trying to own a woman!I don't want to watch anymore because no person should hear people blame a woman for trying to get out of a relationship. If you sham her for religion or force her to stay because you have given money to her. You need to get your head checked because that is evil & it is more pathetic, sad & evil & may I mention again pathetic!",False
10,1,Raging misogyny,laurabradshaw-97801,n/a,16/08/2025,"An incredibly misogynistic bias in the re-telling of murders, representing only the positive opinions of friends/family of those that committed the murder, and portraying the VICTIMS in incredibly negative light. So bad it's like watching a spoof documentary made by Mr Misogyny. Unfortunately not though, and my heart goes out to the friends and families of the victims that have already gone through such trauma.Have the creators been living under a rock and missed the horrific effects misogyny has on lives? Really missed the mark here and I hope they are able to do some learning.",False
11,2,It needs a massive improvement,gurumaggie,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerVery misogynistic, women are portrayed as greedy and lustful, men are merely out of control nice guys done wrong and that's why they did it, victim blaming isn't a good look.",True
12,1,Why the sympathetic tone towards Peter Morgan the murderer,potahtoe,n/a,16/08/2025,Turned off after episode 2 given it's blatantly biased and ridiculous attempt to make it seem like the poor old murderer had no choice but to kill her the wicked woman. Why was there no one to speak from Georgina's perspective? Peter Morgan was dumb enough to think he could buy love. Why on earth would a 25year old escort fall in love with that cheating crusty old ugly goat? This scenario is as old as time. His shameless brother and those useless experts actually tried to paint him in a good light after premeditated murder. Disgusting and pathetic. If he was being blackmailed he should have gone to the police. Documentary makers should be ashamed of themselves for this episode.,False
13,1,Unprofessional people completely sexist,zenbeautysteph,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe female murderer is absolutely crucified by the narrator's, fair enough she is a murderer, but when the male murderers are spoken of..well they were manipulated by evil women..murder is almost justified for women. And well done to the psycho analyst who states, 'I liked her even though she was a single mum you know (pulls face) benefit scroungers!!' Well done lady! You just managed to insult every single mum in the UK....for the record I'm a single mum, civil servant and musician.. much like all of the single mums I know, I'm single because things didnt work out with the dad. We dont give up our lives, careers, friends and bodies, go through all of that pain, sleepless nights and never ending worry and loneliness to scrounge scraps from the government!! ...we were misinformed about our partners, just like the poor victims who end up dead in this show. If only we all had a crystal ball. Some right idiots that shouldnt even of been interviewed here.",True
14,1,No Diversity in the stories,sittinginthecheyd,n/a,16/08/2025,There is a serious lack of diversity in the story telling. I understand that this is a UK series but would you have us to believe there wasn't one story of color that could have been told? I am into all things true crime from various perspectives viewpoints. I get that crimes against people of color are often down played and often have a lack of mainstream media presence. Though this show on the second season featured on Netflix does not cover any POC is highly problematic. It disturbs me that in this day and age there is still these biased methods of stories played out in documentaries still have a platform.,False
15,2,Needs improvement,gurumaggie,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThey have the terrible habit of repeating the same clips over and over.The excuses the killers use are interesting.It's interesting to see the lawyers speak.,True
16,1,Potentially good series ruined by woke nonsense.,bgyoung,n/a,16/08/2025,"Had to turn it off after episode 2, it was just too much nonsense to take. Girl exploits man for money, man exploits girl for sex... Girl is a perfect angel, man is an evil 'cis' male that needs to be thrown from a roof!Murder, meh! Who cares about that, crime of being male is MUCH worse! If it hadn't been for the last 5 mins, I wouldn't have even recalled he killed anyone, however, I knew he was a bad male person, for bad man stuff, so needed to die!The sad thing is, the idiots they get in to analysis the killers are so muddled up by their own issues, they never get anywhere near to actually discussing the topics at hand.TBF, it might actually get better, but I am done. If you want to watch it, then start at e03.",False
17,1,Ridiculous,nikkiwbw,n/a,16/08/2025,I love crime documentaries. The stories are interesting. It was nice to see some news stories not just the same old murders repeated in different shows. The issue is: The amount of liberal brainwashing and propaganda in this show is ridiculous. Some of the things that they dramatize as abuse as Americans would find funny. They insinuate because somebody bought a gun in 1986 and was a farmer they should have known 20 years later he would murder his girlfriend. A business owner was abusing his wife because he was never home. I only made it to episode 9 before I just had to turn it off. I couldn't take no more!,False
18,2,Very Poor,Sikloy19,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very poor series, only watched the first two episodes of series one. Terrible.Badly produced and edited, along with some embarrassing tacky metaphorical scenes.The way the episodes are put together are very dramatised, to the point that I wasn't convinced everything that was said was true either by family and friends, or the ""experts""Many of these talking heads offer no real substance, and a lot of what they say either states the obvious or comes across as very speculative and hearsay.Episodes are way too long, a lot of padding with repetitive scenes and photos, they could easily reduce to 30 minutes, but still wouldn't be any good.",False
19,1,Absolutely foul,kirstiehale,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWatching episode 2, it became very apparent that this documentary series is biased in the worst way possible, and is just exploiting people's stories for financial gain. The story of Gary and Olivia blew my mind. They treat the man as a victim when there is hard evidence that he was abusive, even being convicted of abuse in his past. How could you write a sob story for him knowing this? It's absolutely distasteful and misogynistic, and the writers and producers should be ashamed of themselves. I hope Olivia is able to gain justice for her imprisonment, which also resulted in the murder of her son. This is disgusting.",True
20,n/a,When and how they got murdered,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"All these couples are made for each other. All the relationships are toxic and started off from the opposite of what love relationships should be. Feel sorry for their families, friends and the marital partners who got dragged and still believed their loved ones were the victims from the beginning. Definitely no. I continued watching the series to see where the point they got murdered and how. That's all.",False

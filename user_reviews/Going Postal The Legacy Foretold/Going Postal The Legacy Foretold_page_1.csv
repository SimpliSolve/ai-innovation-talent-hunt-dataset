1,10,This film may be about me and my company....,mikej-24,n/a,16/08/2025,"But that didn't mean I would love it let alone remotely enjoy it. That said, Jason and Tad did an amazing job telling our story. It's fun and funny, sad and aggravating but the story of POSTAL is all of those things. Despite living through all of this insanity, it's wild to see it all told sequentially with such elegance. Cheers to the animators and entire production staff at Playtest for the job they did on this film. Make sure you go check out the games on PC, PlayStation or Switch. Tell yer friends and tell yer family. Prepare yourself, regret nothing and WATCH THIS FILM! GOING POSTAL is a 10/10!",False

3,10,Biased but Accurate,abstractpause,n/a,16/08/2025,"This review will be both characteristics listed in the title of this review. I worked on this film for a bit, and I can't believe or describe how happy I personally am with the final outcome. Tad and Jason put out a film that captures every bit of absurd fun that I experienced in filming Vince, Mike, JSJ, Mike Hunter and the rest. From Pax East in Boston (right as COVID was being announced), to LA filming Miss Carter Cruise and Mister Zack Ward, Tad and Jason put together a film that consolidates 5 years of madness into 2 hilarious and enthralling hours. Go watch it. Bring your kids.Go kidnap someone else's if you don't have your own. It's wildly entertaining. The kids, regardless of whose they are, will enjoy it. You will love it.",False
4,10,Best of the year.,imdbfan-3230559006,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Going Postal"" takes a deep dive into the question of whether or not violent video games lead to real world violence. Told by narrators whom I find myself rooting for through every uphill challenge. While I personally believe video games do not cause violence, each new edition of Postal challenges my views with the game's evolving graphics and play mechanics.The animation featured in the film is both engaging and visually appealing, keeping the viewer entertained with humorous anecdotes. The music in the film does its part to immerse you into the changing atmosphere of each new chapter of the story.I highly recommend this film to not only video game lovers, but viewers that want to watch a geniunly great film.",False
5,10,A hilarious and informative doc full of humanity and heart,imdbfan-9841029586,n/a,16/08/2025,"Going Postal: The Legacy Foretold takes one of the most controversial video game franchises ever and give us a look into how and why the developers continued to persist despite everything working against them. It's a portrait of underdogs who don't care what everyone thinks of them and who will do anything to continue doing what they love. It's rambunctious, it's out of pocket, it's hilarious, and it's human. This was a great documentary and it comes highly recommended to anyone looking to understand more about the history of the video game industry, but moreover anyone who has any interest in social commentary or a story about the human spirit to persevere.",False
6,10,One of the best Documentaries I have seen,AaronR-701,n/a,16/08/2025,I been a postal fan for a while now and I am excited that I got to watch this documentary. I been hyped with the annoying that postal would be getting a documentary and love seeing the teaser trailers. I also love seeing Mike J and Vince talking about their experiences with postal. Of course there are youtube video going into the history of postal but none of them really deep drive into the starting of running with scissors as a company and the impact that postal had in the world of 1997. To me this is one of the best ways to learn more about running with scissors and postal over the 25 years they have existed for.(Username:AaronR-701),False
7,10,AMAZING,secretzrevealed,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ok, I'll admit, I'm very biased towards anything related to POSTAL, so my ten star rating is definitely skewed by that. But I found this docimentary really amazing and it really does show the history of POSTAL really well. I watched it with my brother, and we both had an amazing time watching it together. I'm such a big fan of this franchise, even though i'm very new to it, and I'm so glad I had the chance to learn through this movie. I'm running out of things to say to hit the minimum required limit but I truly did love this movie and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in the topic.",False
8,10,Fantastic documentary on the most iconic controversial franchise of all time,NickPaulNick,n/a,16/08/2025,"Postal 2 has been with me since I was a kid. Originally me and my brother pirated the game because we had no money. We had this cheap Gateway computer that surprisingly was able to run it somehow and we played it all the time. It was the most craziest game I've ever played. It was more shocking than GTA. I can't even describe what this game has. It has racial stereotypes, pokes fun at mass shooting, you can vomit and piss, you can kill Gary Coleman, You can abuse cats and shove a shotgun up a cat's *** and works as a silencer, I mean, I could go on and on, but this game was literal insanity.Now, 20+ years later, I own all the game and I actually paid for it this time (Sorry RWS, love you guys). And I still play it even today.Anyways, check the documentary out, if you're truly a gaming enthusiast please give this Doc a watch and play the games. It's insane, hilarious, gorey, and ridiculous.",False
9,10,BEST DOCUMENTARY,Loljustagamer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Alright so in my honest opinion this is the absolute most comprehensive and well put together documentary about postal that I've ever seen the editing, writing, and cinematography were absolutely top tier it's beautiful to see where this franchise has gone and it's only moving up I personally really loved the scenes of the kid growing up playing the postal games as it reminds me of me. Another thing I really enjoyed was seeing a lot of the merch and old advertising material used to promote the games it's a nice bit of history (in all fairness the whole documentary is the history but you get what I mean haha) honestly I just love seeing anything from Mike J and Vince desi they created the greatest company? Gaming studio? Not sure which to call it haha but it really is beautiful seeing the history.",False
10,10,As a fan of Postal... all I can say is AMAZING,Shadow_Draws,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been hyperfixated on Postal for the last few years and it has dragged me out of some of the most difficult times of my life, so seeing the history in a documentary like this genuinely brought tears to my eyes. Such a beautiful documentary that feels like it was made by Postal fans for Postal fans!!! I'm not ashamed to say I was absolutely bawling at the end :')The editing is amazing first of all, I can't describe it but it just WORKS. The animation throughout is tasteful and also just works perfectly.Also, Zach Ward, Rick Hunter, Corey Cruise, AND Jon St John being interviewed in this is my Spider-Man No Way Home.This gave me a new and even higher respect for Postal, for Vince Desi and Mike J, and everyone who's ever worked on the series.10/10.",False
11,10,One of the best Documentaries I have seen,AaronR-701,n/a,16/08/2025,I loved postal and been a fan for a while now. Thank u for making this 2 hour+ documentary about the history of postal. I been waiting for this documentary to be release ever since it was announced. I love the teaser releases we got to see for the documentary. I also love the official trailers where Mike J and Vince would talk about their experiences. I would honestly say that thus documentary is one of the best there is out there to cover the postal franchise. Of course there are youtube essays about postal but none of them really do the deep drive into the before of the starting of RWS as a company. (Username:AaronR-701),False

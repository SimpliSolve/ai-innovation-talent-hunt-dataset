1,10,"Sometimes painful, but mostly joyous adventure of Life",TheRealMarQs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beautiful and tender documentary about the courage and creativity to pursue and shape Life. Sometimes painful, but mostly joyous adventure starting with one person, but quickly becoming a duo of unlikely companions.It´s 2012 and 25 years old Jonathan has a dream of becoming a filmmaker. He commits to let the dice decide his moves, and to make a documentary about what unfolds. They put him in the same charter resort and shared room, as an older man, Freddie.Jonathan is young, outgoing, energetic, hopeful, charismatic, ridiculously good-looking...well, you name it, he is it. He is all youth, smiles and starry eyes and the future ahead of him.Freddie is one of these people you don´t really notice, and if you do, you might think he seems sort of tragic. Seeming a sad man and sort of like he has been lost so long that it´s become his familiar ground. Unfulfilled in every way, and maybe he never really tried, he emits an aura of surrender.But he is ripe ground for Jonathan´s presence to work wonders. Sparked by the dice, Jonathan decides to make it his mission to bring Freddie happiness while they are so randomly made companions for this one week.But what ensues is not a one-sided relationship with Jonathan as a flimsy do-gooder, but a deep, continuous friendship that affects them both greatly.",False

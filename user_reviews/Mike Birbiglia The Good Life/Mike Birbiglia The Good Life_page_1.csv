1,6,It was decent,d_penn,n/a,16/08/2025,"His latest Netflix special, Good Life, is no exception. It's fantastic. The theme revolves around what exactly constitutes a ""good life,"" and it unfolds in segments inspired by deep, sometimes existential questions posed by his nine-year-old daughter, Oona. In it, Birbiglia explores his complicated relationship with his stoic father, a doctor who also earned a law degree ""because that's how much he didn't want to be a dad."" After his father suffered a stroke, Birbiglia spins ten minutes of material from it that only he could deliver because, as he says, only the son is allowed to make fun of his dad's stroke.",False

3,9,Beautiful and unusual,seraichyk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like another reviewer here, I have to say it's challenging to review Birbiglia because he's so unusual. He manages to be insightful, endearing, gentle, lovable, while not at all corny or sterile or conservative. There is just the right amount of swearing. I personally don't usually care for anyone going on about their kids..but his insightful offerings here are really engaging.Love when he talks about his wife and their relationship. Gives me hope that worthwhile romantic relationships exist.He's just honest, kind and smart.. in perfect proportions. I have found all of his standup to be equally compelling and entertaining. Love him.",False
4,10,Stunningly something,whatithinkis,n/a,16/08/2025,"The problem is I don't know what to call the something. I love and respect this man's work. He goes to places we maybe don't know are places til he gently, kindly and hilariously reveals them. The depth, the surprise . . . It's all so very very amazing. Stupefying really. I didn't want to write a review because this work is almost too complex to describe. And that means my reactions to it are almost too complex to, first address in myself, and then to describe in the context of a review.I laughed, I cried. And at the end I felt a deep deep gratitude. None of that makes for a concise review. The word I'm coming to seems to be 'important.'But how is that the word for a comedy special. And that's why I haven't written a review for this even though I experienced it when it first came out.The reason I'm doing it at all is that I've been coming back here to read the reviews and there are none . . . Or only one. I feel bad about that because this work is so wonderful. So. There. I need to support this. And I have.",False

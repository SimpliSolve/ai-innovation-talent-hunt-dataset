1,8,Art and politics,MiguelAReina,n/a,16/08/2025,"Accompanying the Icelandic group Hatari in their participation in the Eurovision Contest held in Tel-Aviv, and their political position in favor of Palestine, the film raises an interesting reflection on music as entertainment or as a vehicle to convey an ideology. Can we be apolitical in a society where everything is political? It works beyond the portrait of an eminently provocative musical band.",False
2,9,What an interesting documentary!,Wistfull,n/a,16/08/2025,"The general framework of this film is the journey Hatari make from before the Eurovision through to the other side of the competition. However, the real content is all the reflecting and talking they do around the concept of art and its relationship to politics.Iceland is one of the only countries that have officially recognized Palestine as a sovereign state. Consequently, their taking part in Eurovision in Israel was controversial not only in Iceland but also elsewhere. During their stay in Israel Hatari visit both Palestinians and Israelis to get a better understanding of the situation. The film crew have also interviewed many people with different angles on the issue, and the resulting documentary is a lot to think about.Recommended viewing for anyone who thinks that Eurovision ""has nothing to do with politics"".",False

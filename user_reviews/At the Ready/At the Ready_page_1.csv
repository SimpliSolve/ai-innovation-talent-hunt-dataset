1,n/a,Smart idea although bad execution,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed this movie to a certain extent, I feel as though a film like this could seem very authentic and genuine but it gave me the opposite feeling. Throughout almost the entire film I was bored and felt like it as watching a lot of people attempt to make something feel authentic with recreating things that happened before that. Now with that out of the way I can get to the good things about this film, i think it took on a very ""up for debate"" part of society and showed both sides fairly and without bias, it is also somewhat educational and I feel as though i saw many people and many people families. All in al l 6/10.",False

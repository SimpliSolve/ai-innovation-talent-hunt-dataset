1,10,Worth watching. Joyful and sad at the same time.,halaatirah,n/a,15/08/2025,"Elissa has always been my only top female Lebanese singer. I dropped everything to watch the documentary. She is alot like me and thats why I always liked her. She beautiful and resilient. Realistic and romantic at the same time. I urge whoever likes her to watch this documentary. Digging deep into her personal life got her closer to me. It's ok she never had kids, that is her destiny, it's ok people were mockingly her, it didnt change a thing in regards to her audience. I love her songs, in particular the older ones and I love a couple of the new ones. Elissa is self-made and she has always been courageous and attractive. Keep going Elissa, you are a star. I wish you all happiness and I hope you don't wait too long to adopt kids. I assume your puppy will love some company. We understand and we admire you. Id choose you over all other Arab singers. Best of Luck.",False

5,10,What a woman!!!!!,maroompay,n/a,15/08/2025,"She is a true role model!!The documentary was amazing, and it showed us what a strong woman she is, facing difficulties that are not easy to bear. Perhaps what hurt my heart the most is her loss of the opportunity to have children and become a mother because of a deceitful person. I truly wish her a happy life and excellent health.Her attachment to her father and her inability to accept that he passed away a long time ago is heartbreaking. For her, he was the cultural and emotional reference and everything.I truly respect this woman and her honesty. She shows us her strength and weakness, her mistakes and her success..but everything.",False

8,10,Best inspiring and motivitaing documantary i have ever watched!,nadiaaltablawy,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary series is a compelling must-watch. It delves into themes of passion, hope, truth, faith, and happiness. Despite Elissa being renowned as the best female arab singer of the era, the series reveals the strength within her and imparts valuable lessons on maintaining hope in the face of any challenges. How she battled cancer, choosing not to disclose her diagnosis until after a full recovery, is commendable. It's truly admirable to acknowledge that when things are not okay, it doesn't signify the end. Incredibly inspiring and highly recommended. She serves as an idol for women, inspiring and setting an example for others. Respect!",False
9,10,Very Recommended to Watch!,draminamr,n/a,15/08/2025,"No words can express how beautiful this serious is. Very emotional, full of truth and faith. We now don't love Elissa as the number one female singer in the middle East but as a real idol. I hope that all we can express our love to her to make her feel how this documentary touched every single person . She said a sentence in the last episode '' When it is not OK.. It is not the end"". What an inspiring motivating words which teach us not to get disappointed whatever we face. We love you our queen of sensation and your are the best forever and ever. Keep the hard work and we wish if there be a second part.",False

1,3,"Commentator ruins it, hate his voice",SW-0,n/a,15/08/2025,"I wish I had known this person was the commentator, he's horrible, he sounds like his voice is harsh and like he's trying to whisper. He commentated another documentary that I also hated. Diddy: Summit to Plummet. I turned it off to try this one. It's uninteresting and boring. I had to turn it off, in ten minutes. It's more like a podcast than a documentary! Not worth the money. TMZ does a much better job! There is hardly any real videos, it's just this guy talking over pictures and short videos. No interviews or testimony. It's a long boring story telling snore fest. Please don't voice any thing else! Literally, the STORY OF THE YEAR, and you can't make it interesting.",False
2,3,A glorified YouTube video,mickeythechamp,n/a,15/08/2025,"I wanted to catch up on this case since it is interesting to me and I have been following it vaguely, so a good catch up doc can do a lot, this is not it. This is what we call a exploitation doc, a documentary that comes out to just earn some quick money with a popular trend or topic. This is nothing new but what also characterize a doc like this is how quick and unhinged it is. This is a pretty bad doc, but I got my overview at least. It´s just a glorified YouTube video and that is not supposed to be a critique in it of itself, there is a lot of talented YouTube creators, but this doc simply is falling out side of the category called good and ethical filmmaking.A documentary covering P Diddy´s past controversy leading up to the big trail that he is accused off.Again this is a YouTube video, there is so many small mistakes and just bad things about this doc. The B roll is terrible and clearly used from like an open source library with generic looking things in-between shots. The archival footage is good, but is reused a couple of times, so the doc is more of a compilation eddied than anyone actually filming anything. The voice over is pretty soulless and I needed to see if a voice actor was credited or if it was AI. There is a guy credited, but it´s bad when he sounds like a computer too me. I guess this is a rush job doc so he is probably just reading everything one time and then moving on to the next line.The biggest problem here is the assuming and some of the sourcing. Whenever they use actual footage or news articles it can be fine, but there is a line here that got me. Something in the vain of ""According to the internet"". Never use something like that in a doc unless its researched well by the internet. There is a lot of assuming in general in this doc and that is not good for credibility since some will use this as fact more than speculation. The doc is even out before the big trail that is now against Diddy that is, as of writing, still ongoing and this came out way before any substantial was out. Again this is a exploitation doc and nothing more.The doc ends on a positive node, buy might be a bit too conspiratorial, claiming that there might be a secret elite that is making Diddy the fall guy of a bigger issue. This might be true but is not grounded in any form of evidence. I liked the closing line though that all of the bad people will eventually be dragged into the light but again, time will tell.I liked the overall concept of the doc. Diddy´s history of crimes are well documented but again also a bit conspiratorial at times, when the doc just shows what has actually happened you get to know a person that had so much power and money he could do a lot of very disgusting things. That's interesting, that's what I wanted to get caught up on. Sadly towards the end the doc becomes more boring factual, just saying, this person is suing Diddy for this, this person is suing Diddy for that. Borin and unengaging to listen to and watch. But getting to understand and follow a person like Diddy before is interesting and its horrible to hear what he has gotten away with and what he might have gotten away with till this day.Overall I got my drama doc that exposed a disgusting human being and his disgusting behaviour, but this is a Poorman's doc and a glorified YouTube video first and foremost. It is poorly done in a lot of aspects and it's only the subject matter that elevates it just a little bit.",False
3,7,"No judgments given, it's all about reporting about Diddy's case",Rodrigo_Amaro,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Diddy: Monster's Fall"" was actually released (or leaked) way back in early January but somehow the official release date was given as of
February. Anyway, I saw it a while ago and while the memory isn't so fresh there was nothing so impressive to be share of what the documentary was
trying to convey, and there was a giant load of similar docs covering the same controversy on P. Diddy's alleged predatorial/abusive behavior around
the same time and audiences simply didn't care or haven't found something worth seeing. All we know is that the ratings are low, with some good
reasoning.I haven't seen the other films, only this one and it was okay if one considers what the makers were really trying to do - gladly it wasn't an AI kind of doc. It's obvious
that this is one of those cases where the filmmakers won't have a full blown view of what really happened behind closed doors, if the rapper acted
in a criminal way or not since the case is in its early stages, the only trial we got was through the media, witnesses or persons closely
involved with the man or attended those wild parties. The real goal of this piece is to present who Sean Combs/Diddy was way back in his pre-fame
days, how he achieved such power in the music/entertainment industry and how such power can transform a man, for better or worse; and it also
shows the details of his downfall, from the initial charges, the leaked video of his beating his girlfriend, and all the things that made him a defendant on countless
cases of harassment, abuse, etc.In this piece, we don't get to see outside material from what was shown in the media ever since September 2024, we don't get to see an
interviewer following people who knew him, entertainment folks, it's just what's on the record as taken from TV archive. This can only be
interesting for those who missed the news headlines or weren't following the case at the time. It gives you plenty of background and maybe you
can make a judgement. But until we see what goes on through a trial, court proceedings, we don't have much material to comprehend. This is all
about informing what went on and nothing more, a basic TV special.Between conjectures and facts, one can't deny that there's something deeply wrong with the man, and considering the money, power and fame involved
it's hard to not imagine that those dangerous things happen with frequency, it's hidden from view for a long time but once it gets to the spotlight, one
simple denounce that follows with others and an investigation comes along, downfall is just around the corner and there's no turning back, no
justifiable defence for anything. The gathering of material put in this doc is merely hints. The verdict (and a good film about it) will take some time. Before that, it's a room for speculation and there's plenty of juicy things in it to let you informed and knowing more. 7/10.",False

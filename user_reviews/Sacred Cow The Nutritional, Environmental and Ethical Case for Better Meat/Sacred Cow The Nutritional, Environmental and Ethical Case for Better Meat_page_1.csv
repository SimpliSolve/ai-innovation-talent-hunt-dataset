1,9,Great homeschool curriculum,stacywillis-25197,n/a,15/08/2025,"We watched this film for a homeschool lesson to coincide with a habitat, ecosystem, sustainability unit for my kindergartner and 4th grader. We live in a dairy/cattle farm community and this film really wrapped a nice bow around all the things we are learning about in a way that my kids can apply it. It was very informative. I've been anxiously waiting for this to become available. Thank you for bringing this to the world.",False
2,9,Highlights Major Global Issues,info-07819-13582,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am very interested in the topic of food production, and one of the issues is the fact that it has become a plant vs meat battle, that is being played out via media, social media and various other platforms for propaganda.Being single minded or closed minded is never going to solve anything. All conflicts are eventually solved by dialogue and some give and take. The plant based activists need to realise that there is an environmental cost, a loss of life cost and a personal health cost to their diet, and that eating small amounts of meat that was raised in a natural environment is actually a win on all of these levels.From a farming perspective, farmers and more importantly governments and multi national corporations need to realise that how a large proportion of farming is currently being done is also wrong from an environmental perspective, from a loss of life perspective and from a health perspective. So when you look at these opposed stand points, the negative realities of both sides are actually very similar.So if you could stop the gesturing and pontification, the solution is fairly simple - produce food as nature intended, let nature repair the environment, stimulate life and provide healthy nutritious food regardless of whether it is plant or meat based. This film is a good step in the right direction.Remember the words of Nelson Mandela - Education is the greatest weapon known to man!!!",False
3,8,Glad for some balance!,qkhalsa,n/a,15/08/2025,Very happy to watch this documentary! The promise of regenerative farming is amazing but talked about very little! It exposes some of the flaws of the veggie movement without being all aggressive and the movie itself isn't super depressing as some of these documentaries can be. I liked it!,False
4,10,True sustainability is regenerative,steve-23-755662,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film said nothing I did not already know, but it said it eloquently, thoughtfully and beautifully. The only way humans have a future on this planet is to reverse the damage we have done to our ecosystem. Repairing anything requires first understanding it, then you have to do what that understanding tells you. There is no ecosystem anywhere on earth that does not include animals, so animals will have to play a part in the regeneration of our planet. Any system of agriculture that does not include animals is destined to fail. Thank you very much to the entire team behind The Sacred Cow, and all the farmers around the world who are helping in the fight to save our sacred planet.",False

6,10,I think we need more movies like this...,cselenyi-tibor,n/a,15/08/2025,"The film perfectly reflects the contradictory views in the public consciousness. It is not easy to navigate between them, in this it helps to find the right path, following the principle of striving for balance in nature.",False
7,10,"beautiful, thoughtful and loving",jeroensluiter,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dear Diana and Robb and all participants to this wonderful movie,Thank you for your hard work.I consider regenerative agriculture to be one of the most important movements in our lifetime, and this movie makes the case in a beautiful, thoughtful and loving manner.
As Frederic Leroy has so pointedly demonstrated with his research on the concerted efforts by the ideological driven anti-meat movement represented by the World Economic Forum and the EATLANCET folks, we are up against a well-oiled, well financed propaganda machine.
I speak to you as an ex-vegan who had been influenced by what Nina Teicholz's paradigm shifting book The Big Fat Surprise has shown to be pseudo-science; the fallacy that meat is harmful.
I still at times struggle with the reality that industrial livestock operations are extremely harmful to both cattle and the environment, and it's a moral tradeoff at times. This movie really makes the point that things can be done differently, no, need to be done differently or else we will all fail.
I am grateful to all of you for your efforts, I am sure often at great personal costs, to educate the world how we can do better, for all of our sakes.Regards from Haarlem, the Netherlands.Jeroen Sluiter",False
8,n/a,SACRED COW,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"A brilliant and thought provoking journey. The importance of the subject must not be underestimated if farmers are to continue to be able to feed the world. Of concern is the narrative being pushed those with vested interest in the artificial meat business, including politicians. Thank you for putting out this film.",False
9,6,A Paen to Paleo,mellynuss,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is a full-throated defense of eating meat. If you have any radical vegans in your life and need an argument to try to persuade them to abandon their lifestyle or accept yours, this film is it. I was hoping for more of an environmental analysis of regenerative farming, and unfortunately this film comes up shallow. There is only a small section on the carbon impact of beef (and nothing comparing it to other forms of meat eating). And although there is some good footage of regenerative grazing techniques, the film doesn't look at the resources consumed by beef farming or at alternative uses of resources and land. Perhaps this is necessary. The film covers a good deal of ground, from obesity to humane slaughtering techniques to restoring the Chihuahuan desert to 3rd world malnutrition. But for each topic, I found myself wanting more depth. It's hard to talk about the demonization of meat and fat in the American diet without talking about our overreliance on corn and sugar. And is veganism really the same problem as eating too much Fruity Pebbles? Is eating Fruity Pebbles the same problem as factory farming? Is factory farming the same problem as the paucity of nutritional supplements in the 3rd world? Is the paucity of supplements the same problem as using fossil fuels? Instead of a detailed look at how we might solve any of these problems (e.g. land regeneration, obesity, malnutrition, climate change), we just get a panacea: eating meat is good for everything if you do it right. That's a necessary argument if you're confronting an extremist who wants to eliminate all meat from Berkeley, CA by 2020, or if you have someone who needs reassurance that eating even a grass-fed, sustainably raised burger won't damage their enviro street cred. But if you want to persuade someone who thinks that meat is okay -- even nutritious! -- in moderation, but is concerned about land use or climate change, you'll need a different film.",False
10,10,Regenerative farming is so important,drhodeback-46539,n/a,15/08/2025,This documentary explains regenerative farming and how it's actually good for the planet. I had heard about Polyface Farm before and was glad to see they were represented. We have got to do better for this planet by supporting farmers who practice regenerative farming.,False
11,7,"Informative and well directed in places, but overshadowed in others by weak and in some cases ironically double-edged arguments.",nathanshannon_uk,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe film does a good job of showcasing some of the environmental benefits of regeneratively managed livestock when grazed in an appropriate setting. It also contributes to the ongoing public debate around the ethics of our food choices by highlighting some of the false dichotomies that grow out of a disconnect between consumers and the food systems they both rely up and critique, while also showing how, despite wider criticism of farmers for failings of land stewardship and animal welfare, many of those embracing regenerative agriculture are driven by a desire to address exactly these issues..However, some of the good aspects of the film, were overshadowed by the attack that is mounted, on several fronts, against people who choose not to include meat and other animal products in their diets. As well as drawing attention away from the more interesting parts of the film, it also trades on over-generalisations, errors, and equivocations (an example of the latter being the strand of argument that turns around the claim that all life depends upon death).Ironically, a number of the central arguments raised in the documentary, including a number that form part of this 'anti-vegan' thrust, also work both ways - but the film's producers either do not notice this or choose to overlook it.Because diet is such an emotive issue, whether we're vegans (who the film target), vegetarians, omnivores, carnivores or whatever, that often becomes an important part of our identity, which can make it more difficult for us to accept evidence that contradicts the beliefs that are tied up with that, and make us more susceptibility to things like confirmation bias. Sadly a growing number of people within regenerative agriculture feel pressure to define themselves in relation to ""vegans"" (often a proxy not for activists who oppose the killing of animals, which would include many vegetarians as well, and members of the food industry pushing plant-based foods, ostensibly on environmental and ethical grounds, but in reality for purely economic reasons)..I do not feel that it is uncharitable to say that that is also true of those who made this film.The film rightly pushes back against accounts of the environmental impact of different diets that vilify livestock - and ruminants in particular - while failing to distinguish between those managed regeneratively and those in conventional, industrial animal agriculture. It also highlight some of the big problems with monocrop agriculture in non-mixed systems, when they are heavily reliant upon environmentally harmful inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, etc.). But when it comes to cropping systems, it also fails to distinguish the good from the bad, the monoculture field-crop systems from the more sophisticated and environmentally regenerative permaculture, agro-ecological, agro-forestry or indigenous systems that don't necessarily incorporate livestock. We see a similar failure to think beyond the industrial agricultural paradigm in Frank Mitloehner's claims that you cannot grow crops on the two thirds of available agricultural land defined, under current systems, as marginal or non-arable - a claim which, anyone who has looked into the reasons that land is classified in the way it is, or has studied alternative and indigenous food systems, can see is clearly false..Finally, after deconstructing the narrative that red meat drives various health problems and rightly shifting the focus onto highly processed foods instead, the film goes on to include spurious and inadequately evidences claims about plant-based diets being de facto bad for people's health. Many people can get benefits from the inclusion of some meat in their diet, but there isn't really any solid data that shows that everyone's diet MUST of necessity include meat to satisfy their nutritional requirements, or to support Zoe Harcombe wildly exaggerated claim that, it's 'only a matter of time before something in vegans' health suffers'.",True

13,7,"Beautifully made movie, but would have liked more info",mkenyon1978,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI thought that this movie was beautifully made, BUT, also very slanted in one direction. I would have liked to see more scientific proof against the theory that meat is bad for us. Just because it was done for thousands of years doesn't mean it's the right way forward.
Also, the ex-vegan claiming about back issues due to diet, I would have liked more info on why this happened. And also why some do thrive on vegan diets, while others have issues.I know, and think most of us know, that processed food is not the most healthy choice, and while the idea of using a more sustainable and regenerative farming method sounds good to me in theory, I would have liked to hear more about the downsides to this type of farming.
I for instance worry about the scalability and global affordability of this.",True
14,4,Biased Movie,smayreflexology,n/a,15/08/2025,"While the actual filming was beautiful, the movie was unfortunately a very biased view of the food related issues we face as we try to save the planet and the health of individuals. Joel Salatin and other small farmers are very correct about the need for carefully managed farms. The food choice is not one of vegan vs animals. We will always need ruminants to keep our soil viable. That much is obvious and the large CAFO operations need to become a thing of the past. The real problem is with the existence of food corporations which create, market and sell food-like products to our children and all of us who are forced to shop in markets full of nothing else. It is very possible to not only survive, but thrive (children included) on a vegan diet as long as it comes from whole foods. Millions of people all over the planet have done it successfully for hundreds of years. The choice is between real, whole food and non nutritious products that only make us sick. Our government should stop subsidizing these entities immediately. Meat eating is fine for many, but it isn't the issue that is killing us. I wish the film had focused on that instead of pitting vegan against meat eaters. That approach has never been and never will be helpful.",False
15,10,What we all need to see,seaweedsteve-02937,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is very well done and balances information and entertainment and argument in a very inclusive non-combative approach. Its not just some pushback for meat. Not by any means. This is the film that can redirect the conversation from a naive debate between killing animals or not, to a look at sustainable agriculture vs the current extractive damaging system that is failing us, destroying land and farmers and public health as well as causing cruel suffering.. Recognizing that whether the industrial system is used for plants alone or for all forms of food, that animals do and will suffer as their habitatis are eliminated with massive industrial ag. That our whole system needs to incorporate time tested approaches that we can live with, thrive under. This film shows that as long as we isolate ruminants and other animals from our land and farms that we will never be able to feed ourselves, nor will we find our place in the web of life. The farmland itself is deteriorating without well managed animals. To eliminate ruminants from the food chain is not good for them nor our health, but simply a misplaced idealism based on isolated, disconnected naivity from disconnected (though caring) citizens who have lost perspective on nature, traditional agriculture and the needs for nutrition. worldwide, not just in rich countries.This film does some heavy lifting that society needs desparately in order to work through the food and farming mess we are in. Its a joy to watch. See it!",False
16,10,The single best hope for the planet,taipan_801,n/a,15/08/2025,"The science and wisdom in this book take you through what's broken with our mass production, profit driven, mono-cultural, farming systems and that path to ultimate destruction. But it also shows us there is hope for the future.Smaller, bio-diverse, farms using greater, organic based, regenerative farming and grazing practices, and less chemical fertilizers and pesticides, to produce good healthy food, can survive and flourish and re-invigorate our rural communities.The free range, pasture fed cow plays a vital role in getting the carbon out of the atmosphere and back into the soil to a greater depth (ie. 1-2 meters, instead of 20-30 centimeters), greatly increasing it's fertility, water holding capacity and the number of micro-organisms, necessary to grow healthy, sustainable food.Since buying my small, run down farm in Tasmania 2yrs ago I've been tapping into the many resources (in Australia and around the world), out there to follow regenerative farming and grazing practices, to improve the bio-diversity of my soil. It's already paying dividends, my paddocks are thick and lush, and my cows are fat and happy. I rotate my whole herd as one group, around seven paddocks (a different one each week), mimicking the migration of a wild herd of buffalo, and after the cows have moved on, that's when the magic happens. The earthworms, dung beetles and micro flora and fauna do all the work, sequestering the carbon, but they couldn't do it without the cows.I can testify that regenerative farming works. Mother nature's been doing it for millions of years, we just have to stop working against her and help her do her thing. A marriage of our husbandry of the land with nature, and the love and respect for the plants and animals in our care.I don't know any local farmer or grazier that doesn't care greatly for his land and his animals. But I don't know a large corporate company that does. You can make a difference by supporting your local farmers and producers.I sold my house in Canberra two years ago and bought a small 92 acre farm in Northern Tasmania, to try to survive the inevitable, oncoming ravages of global warming. But reading this book, it's given me renewed faith that mankind can still have a future, but we must act now.Alan",False

19,n/a,"If you saw COWSPIRACEY, you need to also watch SACRED COW",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie debunks the Vegan propaganda about animal agriculture being the biggest culprit behind global warming & land desertification. The truth is that ruminant animals revitalize & restore land damaged by industrial farming & help sequester carbon in the soil. Several farmers & even some prominent ex-Vegans are interviewed in the documentary. Facts are provided to show that meat IS a healthy choice for human consumption -- we've been eating meat for more than 3 millions years! Animal foods contain at least 10 essential nutrients that are simply not available from plants. But you have to raise those cows, pigs & sheep outside on pasture, the way nature intended, in order to regenerate the land & produce healthy, nutritious meat for us to eat.",False
20,7,Loved this movie!,cooperash,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very important content, demonstrated and explained skillfully and in an intriguing way. I only wish they went in to healthfulness of a vegetarian diet more. They talk about health and culture of vegans, and I wanted to hear more about the effects of a vegetarian diet.

25,1,Disingenuous arguments,duanetaylor,n/a,15/08/2025,"After watching this is a was an obvious attempt at throwing out some disingenuous arguments that they would know would appeal to those already, convicted meat eaters or those looking to justify it after they have had questions hearing the environmental and or humane aspects. The argument that eating plants kills animals is good example. Secondary deaths is still not same as direct raising to kill and it ignores the immense impact these choices haveWatch it with this in mind and you will see it is just rhetoric disguised in their agenda and leaves out proper experts to explain the other side.",False

1,8,Beautiful rare footage,cybersurfer-411,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerIndia's tigers are among the most beautiful & magnificent in the world. The footage is an incredible window into their lives which is rare & hope it sparks the love for conservation for these magnificent beasts for many years to come by the younger generation. It's incredibly hard to spot tigers in the wild & the team has done an awesome job over 5 years not just covering tigers but also their habitat & the affects of urbanization & education that that people need to conserve these big cats. It's an incredible opportunity for humans to learn the value & danger that these animals are in so we can learn & teach the next generation the importance of conservation of these magnificent animals!,True
2,9,Wonderful film. But what happened to the injured tiger?,scubafiend,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wonderful film about an amazing group of people in India working hard to preserve Tigers and foster a safe and tolerant relationship between Tigers and Villagers across the country. The loose group includes filmmakers, forest protectors, and veterinary experts all contributing to this exceptional work that ensures that both Tigers and the people living near them can live together peacefully. In instances where there is a Tiger causing problems and fear, they have a process to move the tiger to a safe environment where they will not come in contact with people.The film is beautiful and includes rare and unique scenes of majestic Tigers (and other animals) in family groups never before filmed at such close proximity. There are no scenes of killing or other activity that could be inappropriate for younger viewers and provides educational content as well as aesthetic cinematography. My only complaint is there was no follow up on the young male who was injured in a conflict with another Tiger. It left me with lingering concerns and I would have appreciated confirmation that he recovered fully.The dedication of this group and the country in general is impressive and this film is a testament to their dedication, commitment, and success.",False

4,10,Amazing!,amandataubert,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is a breathtaking film. So many years of hard work were put into Tiger and Tigers on the Rise, and it payed off. I have watched it many times and I can still keep on rewatching.The people filming/producing/and everyone involved in Tiger and Tigers on the Rise are so passionate, and it is inspiring.I love Tigers on the Rise because it shows how Tiger was made. It is incredble to the extremes that the crew went to in order to get all of the right footage. The camera traps, and installing them even in a tiger's cave... I find it amazing!Also, I loved how at the same time, you are educating local people about tigers! And how you are finding ways to make the protection and the well-being of tigers a good (profitable) thing for the locals, which makes so much sense since they are the ones who actually have to deal with the possibility of encountering tigers and also lose cattle to them sometimes as mentioned in the film. Also, lifting the road to create a wildlife corridor to enable the safe passing of tigers so that they can avoid highways was genius! It made me so happy to see that.I love these two films and will keep on rewatching! Best documentaries on tigers I have ever watched! And I have watched many.Amazing.",True

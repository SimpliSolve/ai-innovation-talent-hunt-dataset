1,9,"Well , ok!",delfrebert,n/a,15/08/2025,Never have I surfed a day in my life nor have I ever met anyone that has yet this show had me captivated. Very well done and amazing to see these enormous waves being navigated by us little humans.,False
2,7,Great start but sputters to an ending,jchescavage-67362,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI was hooked on the first three episodes and was anxiously awaiting the remainder. Not a surfer, but thr setup was great. Enjoyed the characters, the danger, the mammoth exposure of nature! Episode 4 was great, but somehow they lost momentum in 5 and 6 and we lost the connection with the people and there was just no rousing conclusion. They kinda shoe-horned a new definition of the 100 Ft Wave into the last few minutes and tried to come full circle, but it seems production was hampered by COVID and they just had to wrap it all up and get it to the screen. Would love to follow the journey of Garrett ever tackles Nazare again.",True
3,8,Enjoyable documentary series sure to entice anyone interested in extreme sports,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""100 Foot Wave"" (2021 release; 6 episodes of about 60 min. Each) opens, it is ""Chapter 1 - Sea Monsters"" and we are in Nazare, Portugal, where various talking heads comment on the insanely big waves there. We are then introduced to Garrett McNamara, the Hawaiian extreme surfer who is getting ready to go back to Nazare. Turns out that year ago he retired from the sport, but after running a surf shop for a few years, he just had to get back into the action. One day he is contacted by a local from Nazare who took a picture of what seems to be an impossibly big wave, and would Garrett be interested in checking it out for himself? As if! At this point we are 10 min. Into the opening episode...Couple of comments: this is the latest from producer-director Chris Smith (""Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened""). Here he teams up with Garrett McNamara to document Garrett's never-ending quest for the next big, bigger, biggest surf wave ever, leading him (and us) to, of all places, a small village in Portugal. Along the way we get a ""Extreme Surfing History 101"" overview, including the growing role of jet-skis to reach the biggest waves (and serve as a rescue option). The surfing footage we get treated to is spectacular, and that that is the understatement of the year. It is of course the primary reason why most of us (non-surfers) will be watching this. Can't wait for the next episode(s), although I do wonder what the film makers will fill the remaining 5 hrs. Of this series with. Last, but certainly not least: the original score for this mini-series is by none other than Philip Glass, yes, THE Philip Glass. I couldn't hardly believe it. The (mostly electronic) score is reminiscent of his music for ""Koyaanisqatsi"" and its sequels.""100 Foot Wave"" premiered this weekend on HBO and Episode 1 is now available on HBO On Demand, HBO Max, and Amazon Instant Video. New episodes air Sunday evenings at 10 pm Eastern. If you like extreme sports or you are a fan of Garrett McNamara, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.*Update 7/28/21* I've now seen Episode 2, where we mostly get what happened when McNamara returns to Nazare for his second season there (in 2011). I am absolutely spellbound by the surfing footage...*UPDATE 8/23/21* I've now seen all 6 episodes, and I just came to love this more and more as the episodes rolled along. I've upgraded my original rating of 7 stars to 8 stars. I recently read that HBO has green-lighted a second season, which is fantastic news. I want to see more of this!",False
4,10,Great documentary,observethebeat,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really didn't expect to be so captivated by this docuseries, but the footage is phenomenal and the dynamics captured brings a lot of great energy. Garrett, Cotty, and Al Mennie are captivating subjects and are who I was personally most immediately drawn too, but every person involved really is intriguing, especially the dynamic between Garrett and his wife Nicole.I highly recommend this to both surfer and non-surfers alike, as the footage really is enough to lure people in on its own.",False
5,10,This is amazing!,pedrohenriquemarquesilva,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a must see, doesn't matter if you like surf or not. Very well made documentary üëçWell done.",False
6,10,"Captivating, inspiring, astonishing!",nzhtr,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an incredible show. I have always been both fascinated and intimidated by surfing and surfers. I grew up skateboarding, but the ocean and the waves... that's something very different and this documentary-series just... I don't know, moved and inspired me deeply. To know that these incredible guys and gals are out there, chasing the next big wave, living their lives dreaming about that next huge swell and how they are going to ride it, puts a smile on my face. A wave is something so beautiful and pure and a surfer riding it, is the perfect expression of what it means to be human... at its/her/his best. No show/ movie I have ever seen about surfing as captured it as beautifully as ""100 Foot Wave"". Hats off and hang loose!",False
7,8,Very good,lcjwot,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a non adventurous couch surfer living in the desert, I found this documentary fascinating and beautiful. However the ending sucked so bad I honestly didn't even realize it was the end, tried to go back to watch next episode and was bummed. Love Cotty, hope he finally gets The Wave and credit he deserves.",False
8,10,Perfect,killercola,n/a,15/08/2025,The 100 foot wave is watching this perfect documentary. Unfortunately kids are too busy watching RealHousewives or whatever else crap there is on TV/Netflix. Thank you for HBO. Kept the quality coming.,False
9,6,Hype Over Substance,isabellabomeisel,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found it disappointing. 100 Foot Wave is supposed to be about the raw beauty and danger of big wave surfing, but it often feels more like a documentary about Garrett McNamara's EGO than the sport itself. It missed the oportunity to talk about more important stuff than his personal life. Everybody suck up to him the whole doc.Soundtrack sucksEspecially in Season 2, the first episode was almost unbearable for me... the music was incredibly distracting and overdone. I nearly muted the TV or turned the whole thing off because it was so hard to watch with that soundtrack blaring. It felt like they were trying way too hard to create artificial drama.Garrett McNamara, while undeniably important in the history of Nazar√©, comes off as incredibly self-centered and even hypocritical. He criticizes other surfers for coming to Nazar√© without asking him, as if he owns the place, yet he himself has a long track record of doing whatever he wants without much regard for others. That contradiction really rubbed me the wrong way.And something that really bothered me: the way the documentary talks about Maya Gabeira. Every time her name comes up, there's a subtle but undeniable tone of disapproval or criticism, as if her mistakes were worse than everyone else's, when in fact, everyone messes up out there. The treatment of her felt unnecessarily harsh and, frankly, a bit sexist. She's accomplished incredible things and deserves more respect.I think the series could've been much better if it had taken a more balanced approach...less hero worship, more honesty, and a deeper focus on the sport and the people who risk their lives out there, not just one man's legacy.",False
10,8,Solid surf doco,jamie-36653,n/a,15/08/2025,Anyone into surfing or extreme sports get on this üëçüëçüëç,False
11,7,Maya was RIGHT!,marla_ohara,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you follow surfing, you're pretty familiar with most of the industries' characters. This documentary takes you on a journey as Garrett searches for the 100ft PRIZE. However, we are introduced to some new surfers that join in on that quest. This documentary describes Nazare as the location with the most consistent large waves in the world, which in turn attracts BIG WAVE riders from all over the planet. We are introduced to Cotty, Al Minnie, Maya, Scooby, Koxa, Justine and others who weren't yet Brand Names in the industry. We're given an opportunity to meet these new faces and learn a bit about them, and what drives their passion to ride Big Waves! Garrett's quest to ride the 100ft wave makes for an exciting documentary, but I'm a bit disappointed with attitudes from some of the Usual Suspects. Maya was RIGHT! There seems to be a lack of respect for surfers who aren't from a certain Island. Who would criticize an athlete's near fatal experience? Who disregards an epic ride entered into the XXL, and then says the 'sting' won't hurt so bad by throwing in a bone, 'Wipe-out' award? Who runs a Big Wave Challenge and doesn't assign video coverage for each team, stating that ""we can't cover the entire planet?"" Who hops a rider during the 'heat', when the rules were described, ""Teams waited for your COLOR on the Board"" and then excuses the behavior saying, ""could'a, would'a, should'a?"" YES! All from a certain Island! We are introduced to new faces in the industry who are extremely respectful and humble. As I enjoyed the documentary immensely, I am now a bigger fan of these new Big Wave Surfers.",False
12,5,"Starts out good, ends dull.",elmargo,n/a,15/08/2025,"But then it just becomes really talky and peters out into just a boring series of bros being like ""I wanted a big wave and so I was like 'this is the day', I I saw the wave and it was huge and I got on it and I did/did not ride it. It was real big.""No discussion of the mechanics of how they get into and ride huge waves. Hardly any interviews with locals or exploration of the impact of Nazar√©s popularity on local resources (hotels, hospitals), no real exploration of how this stuff impacts surfers family lives, no discussion of how flying around the world to chase waves is odds with enjoying a nature-dependent sport. Just people endlessly chasing big waves for...I'm still not clear if they even enjoy it by the end.I would say it's not even about surfing so much as it is about surf careerism. Also, a lot the guys they interview seem like arrogant d***s who only care about making sure their sponsor's logo is visible.This would have benefitted greatly from a partnership with a filmmaker or editor who knows how to tell an emotionally compelling story.",False
13,10,Amazing Documentary,amsmaia-893-877536,n/a,15/08/2025,Life of Garrett McNamara and friends starting with the calm life of Hawaii to the most dangerous wave on the planet..well done Garrett and Portuguese friends that make it possible.,False
14,9,An emotional response to an extraordinary series,strockman,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rarely does television bring me to tears. This series has done so several times. Tears of joy, defeat, agony, and fear. I have long wanted to FEEL what it is like to big wave surf - the power, speed, exhilaration, physicality, and fright. I finely have an inkling, due to the superb cinematography, deft editing and sound design, and sublime Philip Glass score. Glass' music raises this documentary filmmaking from excellent to extraordinary.I usually watch movies and television with calm attention. Throughout '100 Foot Wave,' however, I often found myself cheering, clapping, and gasping at the screen.Bravo!",False
15,10,A must see documentary series,paulo-ramos,n/a,15/08/2025,For all surfers and adrenaline junkies.Relates the journey of Garret on the discovery and development of Portugal Nazar√© Canyon giant waves surfing activities.,False
16,8,Alternate Title: The Stupidest Man Alive,teddykupferberg,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a mentally challenged fella right? Which part is worse? Him forcing his wife to surf a wave that she didn't want to surf that nearly killed her or when he tries to tow a jet ski down a boat ramp? That's the thing with all these ""like wow man"" surf Docs, the footage and action is undeniably great but the people willing to do these things (and sadly the people who wind up marrying them) are often insufferably and indeed sometimes dangerously stupid.The gear they use and wear for each and every outing costs enough to pay my mortgage for a couple of months. And cameras and production dollars all aimed at these idiots almost dying. Bravo HBO. You guys nailed the uncanny valley between documentary and Documentary Now!",False
17,10,Fantastic!,shawnmarine-88-284953,n/a,15/08/2025,""" if you live your life like you're always riding a 100 foot wave, you will have some amazing days""",False
18,6,Show drops off its nonexistent premise,frankierayis,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst three episodes were excellent, but watching Garret squirm and moan injured for 3 full hours was just not enjoyable. Worth starting, not finishing.",True
19,9,"A moving, absorbing and breathtaking feast.",boophillips,n/a,15/08/2025,"A lot of surf documentaries are quite one dimensional and probably appeal to younger more hardcore surf fans. This is a thoughtful look at big wave surfing through the eyes of one of the elder statesmen, who was the first known international surfer to ride the waves of Nazere in Portugal. This six parter explores his motivation, his network of family and friends (who are all really interesting in their own right) the highs and lows of catching the biggest waves and the disastrous consequences of wiping out on them. I've been watching surf competitions for 30 years and thought this was a moving cinematic feast that has stayed with me for days after I finished watching it.",False
20,5,Mediocre surf movie,catschasemice9594,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerMcNamara's ego is the true 100 foot wave. Eighty percent of this film consists of listening to him pontificate on a variety of subjects. The other characters with narrative are far more interesting. There aren't enough surf scenes to pull this dull doc into better ratings. Watching the rides is fun. Watching McNamara have foot surgery or natter on isn't . This could have been cut down to four episodes.,True
21,10,"Superb series, for anyone to watch",handaloo,n/a,15/08/2025,"""100 Foot Wave"" isn't just a documentary series; it's a breathtaking, awe-inspiring, and profoundly human experience. From the moment you press play, you're swept away by the sheer magnitude of the ocean's power and the unwavering passion of those who dare to ride its giants.What truly sets this show apart is its ability to capture the raw, unadulterated beauty of nature alongside the deeply personal journeys of its subjects. We witness not only the incredible athleticism and courage of surfers like Garrett McNamara, but also their vulnerability, their fears, and the unwavering dedication that fuels their pursuit. The show masterfully weaves together stunning cinematography of colossal waves with intimate, heartfelt narratives, creating a tapestry of human resilience and the profound connection between people and the ocean.The visuals are simply spectacular. Each episode is a feast for the eyes, showcasing the raw power and majestic beauty of Nazar√©'s legendary waves. The drone footage is breathtaking, offering a bird's-eye view of surfers facing down walls of water that seem impossibly large. You feel the spray, hear the thunderous roar, and hold your breath alongside the surfers as they navigate these monstrous waves.Beyond the adrenaline-pumping action, ""100 Foot Wave"" is a story about community, perseverance, and the pursuit of a dream. We see the sacrifices made, the risks taken, and the unwavering support system that allows these surfers to push the boundaries of what's possible. It's a testament to the human spirit and the power of collective passion.This series isn't just for surf enthusiasts; it's for anyone who appreciates compelling storytelling, stunning visuals, and the exploration of the human potential. It's a reminder that even the most daunting challenges can be overcome with courage, dedication, and a deep respect for the forces of nature. ""100 Foot Wave"" is a truly exceptional piece of television that will leave you inspired, humbled, and utterly captivated. It's a must-watch!",False
22,10,"This is another level, it's a masterpiece",joao_mprata,n/a,15/08/2025,"Oh well, it's sad because i saw the last episode today, it's too short. Thank you Mc Namarama and thank you HBO. I'm skater/surfer and this is lit!",False
23,9,Really good show,dcavello-38380,n/a,15/08/2025,"The production value is very high, the footage and the music played is very complimentary. Could it be a little better? I love the dynamic of GMAC and Nicole, they just seem like cool people who are completely genuine throughout, it's also refreshing to see a couple who are truly in love after being married for years and having kids you can still see the spark between them and that is a beautiful and rare thing to see in this world. I also think the later episodes do a great job of capturing the trials and tribulations we all went through during the COVID epidemic. I found that to be very relatable and the doc is inspiring on so many levels.",False
24,9,A study of the moment and the human relationship with fear and adversity.,fdkwsk,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not many shows have I watched that have repeatedly inspired awe within every episode. The adversity these humans face while getting a chance to briefly dance with a part of Mother Nature that is astonishingly beautiful while simultaneously facing the threat of death is a dichotomy not represented much elsewhere. The cinematography alone, is breathtaking, but to add the orchestral score just adds another layer of majesty to what I am watching. Perhaps, due to my entering middle age while also recovering from a serious injury, this show is just hitting a little extra in the feels for me. However, the relationship of the surfers to the wave, Mother Nature, and how when combining the two all that's left is the present moment. It's a beautiful show, maybe not up everyone's alley, I am not surfer, but this show just inspires one to show up for in life with a little extra enthusiasm.",False

1,7,What Really Happened Is Made More Clear,AudioFileZ,n/a,15/08/2025,"This investigative doc does a good job clearing the claims of a ""rogue mission"" pointing instead to dereliction of duty at the two top theater commanders. The fallen deserve to have the real story known. See it and decide as to a much more accurate picture of what occurred. I'd say it blows the ""rogue mission"" angle out for what it is.",False
2,10,Great documentary,jldivelbiss,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI served in not 1 but 2 branches and understand where the brother was coming from of the SpecOps soldier that was killed who had a strong desire to serve again.But man, I also know the deep cover ups of protecting of senior leadership butts that the military does. These men, Painter and Moseley, are scum of the earth and left their men out to die.God bless our troops and those who look out for their brothers and sisters in arms even in the line of fire. May God rest their souls and bring peace to those who are left behind, especially their children.",True
3,9,Go watch it immediately,DJ_Reticuli,n/a,15/08/2025,"The confused YouTube trailers and preview for this don't do it justice and made me not want to see it... for about 15 minutes. I went ahead and watched anyway and am glad I did. I'm knocking a star off because there's some useless stuff in this that's just taking up time and doesn't serve much purpose. It's also missing some of the detailed facts about how the ambush was executed and the subsequent battle unfolded. Considering how much time is wasted in this documentary and how they left certain information out, they could have utilized the time better. Nonetheless, they're understandably focusing on the cover-up and the culpability rather than the exact mechanics of what happened on the ground. Personally I would have included the details of the battle and all of the recovered battle footage rather than shying away from some of it. Those who think this sort of thing can't happen in the government anymore will certainly get a rude awakening.",False

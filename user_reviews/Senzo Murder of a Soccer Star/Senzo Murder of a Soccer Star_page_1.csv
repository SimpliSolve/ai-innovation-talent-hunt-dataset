1,5,Started good but dragged on with no actual ending,moorekr9,n/a,15/08/2025,"I totally get that not all cases have a satisfying conclusion but there certainly wasn't enough material to spread this over five episodes with no conclusion. Yeah, a lot of stuff happened but they just kept going over the same info repeatedly for most of the series or showed new clips of the same exact inference. Overall, I didn't hate it but I definitely wouldn't recommend. I would've preferred to either watch a 90ish min documentary or read an article.",False
2,5,2 episodes too long.,atolin-27092,n/a,15/08/2025,The story is intriguing and the first two episodes open strong. However you quickly realize that this series should have only been three episodes story. This series irritated me so much I made an account for a review. Too much of it relies on terrible quality audio of different interviews talking in Zulu (SA language) with subtitles. I understand it's a SA story but to rely so heavily on a low quality interview for 30% of an episode is so grating. It made me want to bang my head against the wall. Netflix has this problem in that they find it interesting story and then drag it out to twice it's assumed runtime. I do NOT recommend this.,False
3,5,Far too long winded,studleymoore2027,n/a,15/08/2025,Not a terrible documentary but had no need to be so long and infact would have been a better documentary if it was shortened to 2 hour long episodes.I love documentaries that finish episodes on such a cliffhanger that you can't wait to see the next episode. This documentary unfortunately doesn't do that. It's filled with way too much conjecture and hearsay that all sense of drama is lost very early on. I do feel for the family as you are left feeling that some sort of cover up is present but ultimately that is the whole agenda of the series so it does make you want to read up on the case a bit more for a balanced view.,False
4,5,Speculating not investigating,Calicodreamin,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first few episodes are fairly good, setting up the relevant parties and setting the scene for the murder. Then the last three episodes digress into he said she said speculating without drawing any conclusions or really investigating.",False
5,6,Shaggy dog story,gilesadhamilton,n/a,15/08/2025,The most longwinded documentary I've seen but it does present an interesting look at post Apartheid SA. Otherwise inconsequential and not really worth the effort.,False
6,1,Long winded and boring,klpettifer,n/a,15/08/2025,I stopped watching as I found that after two episodes I actually didn't care who murdered Senzo. It was hard to hear the dialogue and the repetitive scenes just bored me. I hope I never get involved in the justice system in SA it all looked haphazard to say the least.,False
7,6,A head-scratcher,starringajb,n/a,15/08/2025,"Interesting, but it almost seems like this wasn't ready to be released, or the producers were counting on a big breakthrough that never came, so they had to just roll with what they had. I agree with others that they dragged it out by rehashing too much repeatedly. Could have laid out all the information in 2-3 episodes. A bit unsatisfying, even for someone who is ok with cases remaining unsolved by the end of a series, if there seems to be a good reason it was made. Hopefully this effort puts pressure on the right people to achieve justice, but I'm not sure this is it.",False
8,4,There doesn't seem to be the police side of the investigation,biobulletm,n/a,15/08/2025,"Despite it's long runtime, it falls short on an official side of things, instead dwells way to much on gossip, clear dead ends and at times redundant storytelling at other times it's hard to follow.",False
9,7,Solid true crime series.,SpacemanBob,n/a,15/08/2025,"While this series could have been edited a little better for brevity's sake, I enjoyed it overall. I also watched it over three sittings, so I didn't feel like it ran excessively too long.I had no prior knowledge of this case, and it's an interesting one, for sure. There are some twists and turns as the story unfolds, and no shortage of interviews, with credible people directly associated.My biggest complaint is I wish it had featured more footage with Senzo. I felt like I didn't get to know enough about him, other than the obvious. I'm glad I watched this, I'm going to continue to follow this in the news.",False
10,10,4 stars for Senzo,d-31550,n/a,15/08/2025,"But i stopped after first episode, because it just Got so weird and its all like the Wild fkn West, there are no rules, no law, no honest people. And his best friend, you Can see in his eyes that someone told him to Shut the f up about all of it.Its so clear that he knows who did it, and my money is on Senzo's psychotic looking/acting girlfriend.Wtf was her deal? She Think she in a movie.F outta here.",False

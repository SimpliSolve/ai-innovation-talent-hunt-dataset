1,10,Vinegar Syndrome; Restoring the Past to Save our Future!,thesook,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fascinating insight at the people and companies who preserve and restore exploitation and genre film that would otherwise be long gone and forgotten with Vinegar Syndrome being at the epicentre.I've long been a fan of home video label Something Weird and other newer labels such as Blue Underground, Severin Films, Kino Lorber, Grindhouse Releasing and Distribpix but hadn't realised until watching this feature length documentary that all these factions share the common thread of rescuing film elements to share with the film viewing community for years to come.There is so much to learn through these films from an anthropological perspective and as well as being entertaining and titillating it's important that we support these boutique labels in continuing the arduous task of compiling and protecting these vintage works of art.I really admire the passion, enthusiasm and dedication that each of the people working for these labels has in bringing these films back from obscurity.It's easy in viewing Against The Grain to share in their excitement.",False

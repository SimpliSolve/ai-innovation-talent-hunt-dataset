1,7,intriguing,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"This National Geographic series looks at ancient China sites using all the archaeological tools including the most modern one, satellite imagery. The first season has three episodes; Secrets of the Great Wall, Mysteries of Xanadu, and China's Pompeii. The Great Wall is an obvious subject but it's actually the ground level presentation which is the most compelling. Xanadu actually works as a subject especially with the satellite revealing an actual discovery. It's interesting to get a lay of the land and some visuals of the buildings. Pompeii has the most intriguing revelation and it has nothing to do with the landslide. I'm actually most interested in the figures of Shimao which look so strikingly similar to the carvings in Central America. It's as if these people and those in Central America are descended from the same ancestors. The bronze figures are the best.",False
2,5,"Some interesting information, but a chore to watch.",landon-70581,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's truly a chore to watch documentary after documentary shot and edited in this ""ancient aliens"", repeat everything over and over, style.Gone are the days where shows are created for people just looking for an informative show. No longer do they count on having something interesting, and then letting it stand on those merits. It's mystery, intrigue, drama, and repeating phrases over and over like the viewer needs to be reminded this is interesting.If you watch this, be prepared.",False
3,4,This guy!,empdhd,n/a,16/08/2025,"This guy makes it sound like he's making all sorts of discoveries... which he isn't. History doesn't have to be dramatic or action packed. Ancient China doesnt need your help making ""discoveries"", my guy.",False
4,1,What is going on with documentaries lately?,animhata,n/a,16/08/2025,"For a solid thirteen minutes, the dude goes on like a broken record, repeating the same three phrases. He claims he filmed the Great Wall from space (yeah, sure, buddy), talks about the Ming Dynasty building the wall against invaders (like we didn't already know that), and goes on about how magnificent it is. Now, let's be real here. Lately, it feels like 90% of the documentaries out there aren't bringing anything new to the table. They're just regurgitating old information or, at best, poorly retelling familiar stories. And the remaining 10%? Well, they're just shameless purveyors of lies and conspiracy theories (all that suffocating nonsense about pyramids and the quest for Atlantis, seriously?). Can someone please enlighten me on what's been going on with documentaries lately? I'm starting to wonder if we're stuck in a rut.""",False
5,1,Disappointed,stfctvm,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's so much to work with on this project. Western audiences are oblivious to the wonders of Chinese culture, and yet....its a pathetic clickbait attempt at a tv program. Shame and embarrassment are the only words that come to mind. There's literally researchers in the background but all we see is the same non-qualified talking head offering the next commercial break. Clearly the budget is there- I hope it went to actual research that won't be featured by this channel. It is an embarrassment to journalism. How did National Geographic go so low to put their name to this twaddle?!? I do know and that makes it more embarrassing. SHAME.",False
6,5,The evangelistic host was killing me,ubalmond,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe history and information and images were great. The technology gave it a whole other level. And the recent discoveries (not HIS discoveries by the way) were really fascinating.But this guy being nearly emotional about every little thing made it nearly unwatchable. And with him always saying things like ""I'm an expert"" or ""I discovered"" and saying ""my teams"" when really he meant interviewing and working with actual experts gave me a headache from all of the eye rolling. The third episode I was so interested in, but I actually muted it with subtitles because his talking was so distracting..",True

1,n/a,One of the worst documentaries I have ever seen!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was clearly created to spin the narrative in favor of Amy's parents who in the 2015 documentary ""Amy"" were exposed for being pretty bad parents, especially the father Mitch.Amy's father Mitch even said in this documentary that he loves the spotlight and Amy's manager tried to get him on board to send Amy to rehab but her father decided to have her make another album and go on tour while she was suffering.If you want to know the truth about Amy and her parents watch the 2015 documentary ""Amy"" as it goes in depth on her background and the situations leading up to her death, along with how cold hearted and opportunistic her boyfriend and father are.",False
2,9,"Heartfelt and candid. Puts the movie ""Amy"" to shame!",joeyamey,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDon't understand the vitriol directed towards amy's family in these reviews. All you have to do is read each of the books written by her parents to know that they cared deeply for her and did everything they could to help her. This movie is a lovely and intimate movie NOT designed to romanticize amy's problems like the movie ""Amy"" did, which is probably why this one didn't do incredibly well ratings wise. Honesty isn't what people want, they want obfuscation and salacious rock n roll excess leading to the supernova death of a legend. This isn't that at all, which is why I like this movie. R. I. P.",True
3,4,Restoring Mitch,Karl Self,n/a,16/08/2025,"This BBC documentary comes ten years after the death of Amy Winehouse, and five years after the Acadamy Awards-winning documentary Amy. Although the latter didn't set out to be overly caustic, it showed Amy's father Mitch in two unfavourable situations, once telling his daughter to that she must do a show and in another case bringing his own camera team. This documentary explicitly sets out to ""set the balance straight"" and tell the parents' story. I'm not sure it's the point of any documentary, especially one by a publicly financed broadcaster, to tell a one-sided story.",False
4,5,A very good documentary,miabroughton,n/a,16/08/2025,"Orignially, when I first watched this documentary I hadn't watched the 'Amy' documentary that won an Oscar, so I went in fairly fresh-minded and open to hear both of the stories told.This documentary came across as very genuine and, of course, I can't depict what is true and what is false, yet I did enjoy hearing from the family personally as they were interviewed. I thought that brought the film more authenticity.It's a very documentary style film, in the sense that there is no fancy cinematography and effects, there is just the footage and the people talking accompanied by photos, videos and music. It feels very stripped down, like your typical documentary that you'd watch.Its not too bad at all.",False

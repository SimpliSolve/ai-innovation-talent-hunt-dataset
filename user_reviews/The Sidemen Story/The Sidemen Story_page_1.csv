1,6,A Dream Come True,bevanaaron,n/a,15/08/2025,"I must admit, even though I am almost 30, I have been a sidemen fan for a long time, however haven't watched many videos over the past couple years. Nevertheless I have spent countless hours watching and enjoying their personalities since a young age as they are a similar age range to me and have always been a genuine group of people that are very relatable. The documentary shows a few behind the scenes moments, but not as many as you would hope. It's really wholesome to hear of a few tough times that some of the sidemen have been through such as Ethan and Josh, but together they have conquered everything. The only reason I haven't rated this very high is because I feel I already know quite a lot about the sidemen and this documentary only slightly scrapes the surface in my opinion, but it should be a brilliant watch for plenty of people who don't know much about them.",False
2,6,The Life of the Sidemen,The_Rider2004,n/a,15/08/2025,"An interesting portrayal of the Sidemen is showcased here, where all members speak up about their past experiences and overall thoughts about their content as a whole. It delved into some of these aspects, and tackled the struggles the Sidemen had, each of the 7 members. However, It doesn't give us much insight, and I feel as If it could of given us more. But, it was certainly interesting the bits that they did give us.Ethan in particular, his journey has certainly seemed the toughest out of the whole group. And shows how he was struggling in life with all the bullying, and him finding ways to deal with it. And seeing him working hard and going to the Gym and getting much fitter for him was a brilliant journey. And showed how he cared for his body, but also the determination he had to put it right, which was fantastic. And him changing after the bullying about his weight, really is detrimental to him as a person/Influencer. And it was great to see some insight on him.Although I am a big fan of the Sidemen, and have been for years. It's a little strange that other 'Influencers' have to tell us this. Like we don't already know how superb and popular they are. And how big they'll become in the near by future. Heck, you even see people saying stuff like ""The world isn't ready to see Sidemen leave"" and stuff like that. They didn't need to shorhorn it in, it felt rather unnecessary, especially the Hollywood scene.But, I like how we do get to see some fan votes. And what they admire most about the Sidemen. If I am honest, for me it's the difference they've made in the world. And particularly their charity work, with the Football matches. Which is the most entertaining thing to watch out of their catalogue. Which is great, and very dearing. And the overall connection they have with their fans is truly great.I like looking at the clips of their old videos before they became the Sidemen. And how they became part of a group, that was interesting. It felt pretty rushed though, as they then went to another topic. But, I did enjoy that segment. And found it rather funny. The cheap and the expensive videos takes me back, that was a fun little revisit that put a smile on my face. And the life of the expense and the Poor.Although a lot of money was mentioned whenever a video had popped up about a video they made, and personally I didn't care for that. I'd rather listen to more of their backstory then how much money they make. Because, again we kind of already know how much money they could potentially be making. And the Dig at Tottenham, didn't need to be in this movie at all. Completely Unnecessary and don't know why they kept it in the Documentary if I am being totally honest. Which Kind of lessened the enjoyment out of the Doc for me, but let's not end on a sour Note.All of the Boys journey and personal growth to fame has been amazing. And the realisation of how costly he could be and the significant impact it has on people is really great to see here. My personal favourite is Tobi because of his smile. Simon has great lyrics, and is a great wrapper, and can sing so fast it's incredible. And so was the behind the scene of it was also really interesting. I liked KSIs backstory more then anything. About family. W2S seems like a pretty chill guy, and seems like a good dude. And the guy who made those Minecraft videos was phenomenal and he was great at the game. Also the motivation between the boys is great to see. And really motivates you to create some content yourself, later down the line perhaps. And goodluck to you, if you ever do a video yourself.Would I recommend this Documentary?Yes, but don't expect too much information, but congratulations to the boys on their paths and journeys, life stories, and the story of success and even redemption, 6.5/10.",False
3,8,Good Overview,brbktdyq,n/a,15/08/2025,"Production value was great and it gives a good insight into the sidemen. I think a rating of 8 is very fair as nothing is ever a 10. Being a fan from the beginning myself I do believe Netflix missed a lot of the lore out which has brought my rating down a little, but overall I do believe its probably a fair representation of the sidemen and how they came to fame. For someone who doesn't know the sidemen fully this would be a superb watch and gets a small insight into what they do and how they became so famous. Like I said I do believe Netflix could have added at least another 40 mins to an hour on top of what was produced by just adding small bits of lore.",False
4,7,Another Insight Into The World of Celebrity You Tubers,t-d-t-m82,n/a,15/08/2025,It's a long documentary about the crew of the Sidemen and focusing on their individual chanels before they became the modern You Tube force which they are now.They provide unique content every Sunday on You Tube and their uploads gain millions and millions of viewers. They are the most succesful UK You Tube collective in existance; at the time of writing.I have watched their content and it is fun and easy TV to goof-off with late-at-night with a bowl of popcorn and a can of cold beer.It's got the Generation Z seal-of-approval and everywhere they go they get cohorted by crazy kids after a slice of the fame and the fortune.However it's quite self-indulgent and it is a bit long for what could essentially have been compressed into an hour. I got a bit tired of the format and as a documentary perspective it was not as fun as logging into the channel and just dropping out.There was some great information about mental health but they sometimes don't take things too seriously because they're too busy laughing to realise the actual message. I think they are maturing as men and are realising how important mental health is and advocating it to Generation Z and beyond is fabulous.I was also glad that they are doing charity work and an important aspect which is funding childrens' school trips. The Government don't do enough to help the poor and it's sad that famous people have to cover it. Austerity helps only the rich.It's nice to see these guys reach out to their communities and help others. It's a nice story and I wish them the best-of-success even though this documentary is a bit dull compared to modern produciton standards. Please get someone like Louis Theroux on for a professional angle.,False
5,10,It's so good,zaktoora,n/a,15/08/2025,The sidemen story is really the story of the sidemen we go on a journey all away back to 2013 to 2024 and it's great we get a glimpse of the lives of the sidemen and it shows their fans including me at event and meet and greets or truly it an amazing documentary it is only available in the uk I wish it was international for everyone to see but this documentary really explains the sidemen to people who don't watch the videos and the new fans it also show the behind the scenes of the sidemen which I think is a great thing to see in a documentary it's the thing your looking for in a documentary I really think it's great.,False
6,7,Good Story üëç,Brookesz3,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerGood film on how the Sidemen got to this level. I have been a fan of the Sidemen for 7 years now and I can say it definitely showed the rise they have. Solid watch if you watch or even respect the Sidemen. Ethan bringing up his past and how close he was to suicide really brought true feelings of influencers to people. All of them Sidemen talking about mental health as well is a very nice touch but the Sidemen know the difference between banta and when to really talk. Even if you don't watch the Sidemen seeing this from a business side is also amazing. Showing you the inside of the Sidemen and how they are as a business behind the content side. Great watch üëç.,True
7,10,Story of how 7 friends captured the hearts of an entire generation,ananthukrishna-77470,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Sidemen's Netflix documentary is a captivating journey through the history of this iconic YouTube group. Tastefully directed, it weaves seamlessly between past and present, offering a masterpiece that provides insight into the boys' remarkable story. With seven unique perspectives, the documentary serves as a perfect introduction for new audiences, delving into the group's evolution, friendships, and the challenges they triumphed over. While the focus remains on the collective narrative, it doesn't shy away from the individual struggles, highlighting the journey of each member. However, it's essential to note that some, like Vikram, might find themselves slightly overshadowed on the sidelines. Nevertheless, the documentary brilliantly captures the essence of the Sidemen, creating a must-watch for both fans and those unfamiliar with their remarkable journey.",False
8,7,Not made for sidemen fans,robson-02523,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're a sidemen fan expecting a deep dive on their lives that goes past what you probably already know through YouTube, it's not that. (Tbf they've said that whilst promoting it)What it is: a well put together documentary with an overview of their story as a group, then brief overviews about each individual, their motivations, and struggles etc. Good production value, and good pacing makes it watchable. 7/10I can't tell if anyone who doesn't watch them would particularly find this interesting, but maybe!P.s. Found it hilarious that vik had to tell one of the Netflix cameramen to pan the camera so people knew what was happening lol.",False
9,4,DONT FALL FOR THE TITLE,iamtanjim,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Sidemen Story"" offers a glimpse into the lives of the renowned YouTube group, The Sidemen. While it captures the group's camaraderie and rise to fame, it falls short in delivering a balanced portrayal of all members, particularly Vikkstar123. Known for his significant contributions to the gaming community and business ventures, Vikk is reduced to a simplistic character motivated mainly by financial gain. This overlooks his passion for gaming and his role in shaping online communities. Despite its moments of emotion and humor, the documentary's narrow focus on financial motivations, especially regarding Vikk, detracts from a fully realized narrative of The Sidemen's collective and individual journeys.",False
10,10,"SIDEMEN, Thank you.",mccartneyollie,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have grown up watching these 7 lads and this documentary really gave me a lot of nostalgia and happiness for how far they have come.They have given their audience countless amounts of extraordinary REAL content for the last 10+ years and their dedication for everything has inspired people like me to share content of my own.This documentary shows all of your ups and downs and it really does feel like we are all a part of your story.The dedication shown in this really shows how much you all care for your audience...Thank you for everything JJ, Harry, Simon, Vikk, Ethan, Tobi, Josh and the Sidemen team.",False
11,3,Sidemen: A vanity project,christopherdominicdunn,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Sidemen: A Shallow Dive"" on Netflix is a missed opportunity, offering little beyond surface-level entertainment. It fails to delve into influencer culture's complexities, ignores controversies, and presents the Sidemen as one-dimensional figures. With choppy pacing and technical shortcomings, it lacks authenticity and meaningful exploration. Ultimately, it's a forgettable watch that fails to leave a lasting impression.The documentary's failure to address the controversies and criticisms surrounding the Sidemen (mainly KSI) is particularly glaring. By sidestepping these issues, the filmmakers not only miss an opportunity to provide a more balanced and nuanced portrayal of their subjects but also perpetuate a sanitized image of the influencers. Without acknowledging the challenges and controversies that come with fame and influence, the documentary feels disingenuous and out of touch with reality. This omission undermines any attempt at authenticity and leaves the audience with a shallow and superficial understanding of the Sidemen and influencer culture as a whole.I've watched these guys before they even formed the sidemen and I'll always be grateful for what they have put out but it's hard to back a group when their most front man continues to be so out of touch and controversial.",False
12,10,Great story about a few lads in a homosexual open relationship.,sanghalap,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great story about a few lads in an open homosexual relationship. Baldski being the main 'batty man' describes his love story with each of the sidemen. In particular Simon his first love. I do feel at times he goes a bit too in depth about these relationships as he describes the sexual positions he has put simon in but i guess if that's what made him the person he is today then fair enough. Balski also talks about how he tried to get his more successful and better looking brother Deji to join in this open relationship but Deji is a man of morals and politely declined his proposal. All in all a good story, never knew all this was going on behind the scenes. Very informative.",False
13,10,most REAL documentary i have ever watched,xolibbyroseox,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFrom start to end i was crying!Hearing each and every side(man) talk about their feelings the way they have, talk about their insecurities or life was inspiring. Learning more about them day in day out personally makes me feel like u can relate to them a lot more. Going in on each individual sidemen made it perfect! Showing both their lows and highs i think really helps for the audience and to understand that mental health is important for everyone. Not just people who are classed as ""normal"" but also big content creators like the sidemen. And especially with them being male and speaking about them the way they did allows male audience to get that help too! VERY WELL DONE SIDEMEN and nicely made. Hats off to everyone behind the scenes, producers camera men and especially KON.",True
14,1,I don't like documentaries,thebloodywolf-17557,n/a,15/08/2025,I would of preferred if the sidemen actually did something entertaining for once honestly their content is good but anything outside of that isn't the best the sidemen should do more acting wise maybe it would get a few old fans back because they were known for being satire and actually funny back then then again if they make one joke they get cancelled (Accept Harry) but besides that I hope sidemen do get the opportunity to at least do skits something funny and original not the same old reused format of 20v1 or them doing a gameshow only middle aged parents watch and not their targeted audience (ps I didn't watch the Doc but it's probably bad)I'm joking btw.,False
15,10,LOVE IT,mxjtgxdc,n/a,15/08/2025,"Been a fan since the start. I'm so proud of all of them, overcoming life's toughest obstacles together and separately. They're all growing up and it's so nice to see the bond they still have together.I'm 21 now, and they've helped me through the darkest of times. My kids will be watching them, and they will always be legends. Again I'm so so proud of all of them. This documentary is one of the best I have seen. And a massive massive appreciation for the crew as well!Cried most of the time at the memories,but they was tears of joy. Thank you for everything sidemen and crewWe love you sidemen.",False
16,1,"""Unmasking 'The Sidemen Story': A Disgraceful Misrepresentation of Gaming Legends""",ihnfitbh,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Sidemen Story"" is a slap in the face to fans who expected an in-depth exploration of The Sidemen's journey. It purports to offer insight into their lives but falls miserably short. Vikkstar123, a key figure in the group's success, is unjustly portrayed as nothing more than a money-grubber, disregarding his significant contributions to gaming and community building. This reductionist view overlooks the passion and dedication he brings to the table. Instead of a balanced portrayal, we're subjected to a narrow focus on financial motivations, which is not only disrespectful but also fails to capture the essence of The Sidemen's collective and individual journeys. This documentary is a disgrace to their legacy and deserves no more than a pitiful one-star rating.",False
17,10,One of the best story telling ever!,taleteller-64672,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been following the Sidemen for years and this is one of the best portrayals I have ever seen. Its really got me teary eyed as we got more insights into the character growth of each of our lads. While its scary to even think what we will do with our lives if they stop, its a relief to know that they enjoy doing what they do, and that its unlikely for them to stop anytime soon. I loved every bit of this documentary with all my heart and I cried at some moments. Especially when they showed how difficult Ethan's journey has been and all that he had to go through for the years in the beginning!",False
18,10,Nostalgic MasterPiece,leoaustin-09713,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWatching these 7 icons talking about their past brings back so many memories from them being small up and rising stars to international treasures. They have all made amazing glow ups, physically and mentally and I can still see loads in the future for them, I think I really got interested when they talked about everyone's backgrounds, and I found it interesting that ksi was once gassed to play and meet zerka and now people get it the other way round. They also go into detail about the old house which is also Iconic and I love how they link Harry's rage 'go on a hike' to where they all spent most of their days inside playing games all day to help get famous.",True
19,3,"Good YouTubers, Bad Movie",atharva-83369,n/a,15/08/2025,"It feels a bit odd to say but it really seemed like the human element to their fame was missing from the movie, especially when it comes to respect for their fellow audience. Everything is for views or impressions, and they often fail to consider the emotional value of the content they create.Most of the topics of the movie already have content based around this on YouTube. This was their opportunity to do something a bit deeper with a bit more self-reflection, for their own audience.Instead they ended up making a film targeting the netflix 'movie audience' instead of their own.Their videos are better than this movie - even as a documentary of their own lives, and they would be an hour and a half better spent.",False
20,10,Just proud to see your childhood heroes our brothers to see them at this level,amaanhussain-94012,n/a,15/08/2025,I love how boys treat each other just amazing to see them reaching this levels we feel so proud to see them on Netflix documentary some random kids in their bed rooms can do this so you can do this they inspire a lot of people up coming generations how to be big how to be good friends how does people matter over money how does friendship matter over any thing how to use your fame just be real and just grind everyday so even a random group from uk change the world how can a true friendship lead you to the goal of your lifes and make your family proud help people how need helo and inspire others and there parents thanks for everything üíó,False
21,1,Awful,hadriantheisen,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is worse than the Flash and Elementals combined. The production value is awful and some of the shots just feel like they were there to pan out the run time. The people featured in the documentary are so awful and annoying. They are like if you brought back Team Ten and gave everyone in the team drugs. The main character is named KSI who is really annoying but has some character traits that stick out compared to the rest of the otherwise mediocre cast. There is this one character where you can tell no one on the team likes, I think his name was Simon but it is hard to remember a single detail of this bland and boring documentary. If you have any respect for yourself and for your eyes and ears I would suggest to stay far away from this god awful, annoying, and overrated film.",False
22,10,Congratulations sidemen,chelseawardle-72413,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI love this and this is a amazing I have been watching them for the whole 10 years and they should not be able to do the things they do but they can and they are is so many lanes not just YouTube they all inspire me and i am glad they spoke about mental health it is really important. I like the layout of this too and the cinemaphotoghy as well and I cannot believe how much they have changed and how inspiring they are and I am a fan from day one. I cannot believe the sidemen put so much pressure on them self, they do not need to because the true fan will not leave them no matter what. Well done this was great.",True
23,10,CINEMATIC MASTER PIECE,tylerclarke-65497,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerThe way its shot adds to the emotion that is being portrayed in the shot. The best shot is when the camera moves around the sidemen posing. I've watched the sidemen for many years now and there was facts about the sidemen that I didn't even know about before watching this. If I had to sum this up in one sentence it would be that its a cinematic master piece of emotion and shows how passionate and hard working the sodemen really are and it gives you an insight into how the sidemen really work and how the fact that us fans sometimes don't realise how hard working each sideman is. Its also shows that sometimes everything isn't as perfect as it seems.,True
24,10,Sidemen Story,mhlone,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerIt's a really good documentary shows how much they've been through as a group and back. The sidemen are the OG of the YouTube scene and seeing them thrive and have their own Netflix show is so refreshing to see and shows how far they've came. Show's the mainstream media and casual viewers that the YouTube scene is such a massive scene and we have a massive community. Shows the amount of effort and hard work the sidemen have undergone to get to the highest of levels and they are even increasingly rapidly rising still even though it may seem they're at the top still. Can't wait to see what's next for the sidemen overall a great doc!,True
25,10,Really good insights,tpritchard-22442,n/a,15/08/2025,It's a really good insight on how crazy there live can be with ups and downs and dealing with mental health issues and physical issues and how the Sidemen built there empire and how much they love and respect each other and there fans. The facted I have been a fan of the Sidemen for years and even longer with there own channels seen how much they have grown over all these years The Doc is 100% worth watching then go watch ethan doc and his mental health and physical health journey great push to help men and women to be more open about mental health and understanding that there is always someone out there willing to help and listen.,False

1,6,Deon Cole is Pretty Funny,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't know much about Deon Cole. I never heard of him and never saw him before. He is a 40 plus, divorced stand-up comedian. While I never saw him before this special is actually very funny. He hits on a lot of funny subjects about being an aging male and dating in the modern age. I like his delivery, but be cautioned that he is dirty. He has good stand presence and good physical comedy. I like the venue and crowd in Brooklyn for this special. The energy is good. While I did not know him before this special I will go out of my way to check out some of his prior specials for his funny perspective on being a father, male, and dating person in the 21st Century.",False
2,10,Deon at his best!,anmontoyaav,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you like good stand-up comedy shows, this is for you. If you want to get a good laugh and have some to think about and chuckle, this show is for you.Deon is usually pretty funny, but he was absolutely hilarious in this show. I laughed so hard during the entire show that my face and my belly hurt. I love that he can be so funny and raunchy while still send positive messages. This show was way funnier than other recent stand-up comedy shows from other famous comedians like Chappelle, Rock, and Burr. The show was recorded live in Brooklyn, NY, with a huge audience. Still, Deon got to interact with the audience and make some witty remarks. You'll feel almost as if you were part of the audience. I highly recommend this show!!!I think Deon should get more recognition and support so he doesn't need a flyer anymore (you'll get the joke if you watch the show.) Please give the show a try and spread the word out!",False
3,10,Master Class,rtcramer84,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the best stand-up I've seen in a long time. To me this is a stroke of genius. He really pushes us to suspend all preconceived notions of the constructs we hold dear to our heart. Do you ever wonder why comedians use the words and phrases they do? They have honed this monologue over thousands of hours and put this finally crafted experience at your feet. His call backs are not phrases but jokes, his words tell us who he is, and how he views the world. Instead of wondering where the next laugh is, consider taking the journey to understanding the artist and fully opening up to what he is saying. Then you will understand why 10 stars is the only possible rating.",False
4,10,He's Just Funny,sunshinemodel-56140,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hands down, he's definitely one of my fav comedians. He's naturally funny. I always love his one hitter jokes. Idk how he puts that many on a small sheet of paper though haha. And the thing with Deon is that he doesn't have to try too hard, being a comedian just seems to come natural to him. He can talk for an hour straight and have you almost about to spit your drink out too many times lol Don't even think about eating a meal, while watching him, or will risk chocking on your food; because he just says some random stuff at times, and you will BOL. Love him & S/O to his mother! The ending had me in tears ðŸ•Š",False

1,10,Do NOT Miss This - Greatest Film Ever!!,imdbfan-2658915750,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is no movie in the world that I have enjoyed as much as this. I am a HUGE Imagine Dragons fan, I would say the biggest, so you had better believe my expectations were mountain high. Even still, it managed not just to meet them, but to absolutely smash them! Now, let me tell you that even Imagine Dragons: Live In Vegas was truly astonishing to me, but this is over a million times better! Every second was heartfelt. Every beat was perfect. Now, the most amazing of the songs played had to be Eyes Closed, Wake Up, Nice To Meet You, Whatever It Takes and Believer. Though none of those (Other than Eyes Closed) are near my top 10 songs by them, they were preformed, just, incredibly! Whatever It Takes WASN'T but it kind of seemed acoustic. Acoustic songs are truly one of the areas this band shines. I'm a little upset that In Your Corner wasn't acoustic. Although this movie was truly amazing, there are a couple things I would change. Firstly, it was WAY too short. The 2 hours 12 that the film lasted only felt like half an hour it was soo good! Next, I'm a little upset that Gods Don't Pray and Kid from their album Loom didn't make it in. I understand that they weren't played in the concert, but they could have been put into credits or an opening sequence or something. That upset me. Though the film was mostly about the band, at least at the start of the film, I feel they put a bit too much focus on the LA Film Orchestra. I understand that they were also playing and to focus on them a little but, but mostly, I think they should have done a little less, to focus on the amazing band. Lastly, I was very disappointed that not a single Smoke + Mirrors song made the set list. Not even their hugely popular ones like I Bet My Life or whatever. Other than that, it was honestly the best cinema experience I have ever had. Loom is my favourite album of all time, and I loved seeing them preform this masterpiece live. I went with my friend to it who is also a massive fan - not as massive as me, but still big, and we had an absolute blast. They played many of my favourites, like Eyes Closed and Walking The Wire, and provided the most memorable experience ever. I will be going back on the second night. I couldn't recommend this more - even to people who aren't a fan of the band. It's unforgettable. The Don't Forget Me performance I will never forget. Do NOT miss this. Best film EVER!!",False
2,10,Next Best Thing To Live,KimB-52,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw them live in concert recently on the Loom tour. Seeing this movie was a no brainer; movie ticket pricing, comfy reclining seats, AC, food and drinks. The orchestra made it even more special. The talent of the those musicians was unbelievable! So much energy! I went because I'm an Imagine Dragons fan. I left blown away by the performance of the band and the orchestra. What a masterpiece! The length was just long enough. It was limited release. Hopefully, it will eventually be released on a streaming service or even better, return to theaters. I would see it over and over! My showing was during the week, so it was a small crowd. It would have been awesome to have a packed theatre and a little audience participation.",False
3,8,"Great concert, but where's Smoke + Mirrors? ðŸ˜­",thedubstepdoge,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGreat and fun concert, the band was awesome and the orchestra really added a lot to make it a unique sound. Unfortunately I'm not a big fan of the songs on Loom, they're not bad songs but I still just don't really connect with them most. The variety of songs was not bad but it's crazy that they didn't play anything from Smoke + Mirrors! My favorite songs were definitely It's Time and Demons (my favorite ID songs in general), these really slapped with an orchestra. It's Time is such a magical song and it was awesome how Dan talked about Tyler Robinson and how he passed away from cancer shortly after the concert in 2011, with also showing concert footage from way back then. Also Ben's guitar with the trans flag and the pride heart is awesome!!!! I love how accepting and supportive the band is.",True

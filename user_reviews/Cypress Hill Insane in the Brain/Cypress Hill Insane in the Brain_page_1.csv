1,7,Fun documentary for fans,bakergarrett,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a fun documentary on one of my favorite rap groups, Cypress Hill. This had lots of fun stories from B Real, Muggz, and Send Dogg and every single one was extremely interesting. It was awesome to hear the old demos of their first tape and to hear B Real find his voice. It also spent a lot more time on there 2000s catalog witch I found neat.My main complaint is that Black Sunday wasn't touched a ton, and temple of Boom was not talked about at all witch was dissapointing, still this is a great documentary for hip hop and weed heads. Prolly closer to a 6 than a 8 but still gas.",False
2,9,Great doc.,cdemko,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this doc, maybe because I first listened to cypress hill when I was about 8 in my cousins cruiser with 2 12"" in the trunk. But 23 years later I still cant skip a song when it comes on. And low-key, skull and bones is my fav CD. Prolly because I was 16ish with a car and my tapedeck to portable cd player setup. But the rock-rap hits. Never knew the backstory of why they did a double disk till I watched this.",False

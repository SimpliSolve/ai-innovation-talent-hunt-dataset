1,10,Pure art born out of intense pain,boolfalse,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is my first review in several years.It's extremely difficult to describe in words, and I don't even remember a single movie I've known in the past that could be compared to this one.As the participant of the war mentioned in the film, what I got to watch on the screen wasn't unexpected for me, but at first glance, the film shot on a regular smartphone contained incredibly deep episodes, and using a word ""professionalism"" isn't enough to describe.I won't deny that watching the film is hard. But it should be said that those people who will complain about this will return to their normal daily routine in a few hours, and this pain will remain at the discretion of the owner. On 9/11, there was also rare real-life footage from which a documentary was filmed, and a few yers ago even amateur footage of the sinking of Titanic was found. And why do you think that in such cases the cameraman has the goal of influencing the viewers? This movie was shot from start to finish without scripting, and if there are people who complain about it, believe me, the first ones who don't want it are the filmmaker and his family.After watching this movie, you need time to digest it and understand why a particular episode was placed into the movie.There is a limit to reviews, and I have too many thoughts about the film.I have close people with whom I would like to watch this film, but I don't know if the author wants to make this film public in the future or not. And if she doesn't, I'll understand it at all.",False
2,10,A must watch,rimagrigoryanysu,n/a,16/08/2025,"1489 is a raw and haunting documentary that transforms an anonymous war statistic into a deeply personal and devastating story of loss. Centering on the Vardanyan family's relentless search for their son and brother, Soghomon, it is a visceral portrayal of the human cost of conflict.The film's strength lies in its intimacy. Filmed by Soghomon's sister, Shoghakat, it offers an unfiltered view into the family's heartbreak and resilience. Her decision to document such vulnerable moments - from anguished searches to the excruciating wait for DNA confirmation - draws viewers into the unbearable weight of uncertainty and grief. At times, the rawness of the footage is almost too much to bear, making the film a difficult but necessary watch.What makes 1489 so poignant is how it bridges the gap between the personal and the political. By focusing on one family's ordeal, it illuminates the profound impact of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in a way that no news report or statistic ever could. Soghomon, a talented young musician with dreams, is not just ""missing in action"" - he is a son, a brother, and a symbol of the countless lives disrupted by war.The film's unflinching honesty may challenge viewers, but it is also its most powerful aspect. 1489 serves as a testament to the enduring pain of those left behind and a stark reminder of the humanity behind every number. It is a deeply moving and unforgettable exploration of love, loss, and the unyielding search for answers.",False
3,9,Very important film,arevikavanesyan,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is not easy to watch. The hardship and sorrow of the family goes inside you, like there are films that go under your skin, this one gets to the bones.For us, Armenians, it's even harder as we have personal connection to all what's happening, almost every family in one way ir the other... Nevertheless it's important to watch it, so to never forget what you have seen and felt, to know what is war.For foreigners it's important film to understand wars in general an families directly affected by them. No death is easy, no victory is good enough and capitulation is of course super hard.",False
4,10,must watch,sonabulgadaryan,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is a must-watch, though it's not an easy one. It's crucial to see if you want to understand the profound pain and uncertainty families endure when a loved one is missing or if deceased, where the body might be. The story isn't just about a single case; it reflects the harsh reality faced by countless families with soldiers on the front lines. The emotional depth and raw portrayal of such experiences make this film a powerful, heart-wrenching testament to their struggles. It offers a sobering glimpse into the lives of those living with the constant fear and hope that define their existence.",False
5,1,"Please, stop making me feel sorry for you...",Bella_Sar,n/a,16/08/2025,"1489 tries to depict a family's pain during the Nagorno-Karabakh war, but it ends up feeling boring and overly reliant on pity.... With smartphone visuals and a disorganized narrative, the film fails to create a compelling or meaningful story... Instead, it comes off as whiny...with little depth or insight into the conflict or its broader impact....
The entire documentary feels more like a campaign to make the audience feel sorry for the filmmaker and their personal struggles, rather than shedding light on the tragedy of war... It's more exhausting than emotional... lacking both structure and focus....",False

1,7,Hate me more!,carlosagm-56274,n/a,16/08/2025,"Club América is arguably the biggest club in Mexico.It has the most championships, the biggest fanbase not only in Mexico but abroad.This miniseries explains well how America became what it is now, and why it is so popular and hated.The narrator Carlos Ballarta is great, with a little comedic touch.It features good quality, remastered archive footage from decades ago.It features legends like Reinoso, Zague, Tena, Cuahtémoc, Zelada, Brailovsky, Ortega, Zamorano, just to say a few.It captures the essence of iconic moments, remembered by millions, such as the formative 60's and 70's, the golden era of the 80's, the disappointing 90's, and the renaissance of the 2010's.However, there are some shortcomings. Little is said about the 2000's, when there were few titles won, but there were some memorable moments, such as the great participations in the Copa Libertadores 2002 and 2008.It is surprising that some key pieces in the club's history are not even mentioned, such as Chespirito, a comedian and producer, who was a fervient fan and was the mastermind behind TV shows such as Chavo del 8 in which the club was mentioned several times, and gave it an international projection, especially in Latin AmericaLittle or nothing is said about Piojo López, Salvador Cabañas or Chucho Benítez, who managed to bring some glory for the team in dark times, although their time at the club was relatively short.And finally, there is too much talk about the post-COVID-19 era in 2021 and 2022, with too much focus on irrelevant players who achieved little and are not even part of the club as of 2025.In 2025, with a great three-peat and a new golden era that we are experiencing now, it gives the feeling that this series was released before it was due.Hopefully they will release a new chapter for the series, because it deserves it.",False

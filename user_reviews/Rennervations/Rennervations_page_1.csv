1,8,Fun and wholesome,Daviteo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Renner is charming and his BFF Rory is...well...Rory. The fabrication process is enjoyable to watch and the ""new build per episode"" creates some good insights into the fabrication and construction process of these vehicles.Some people have said ""why is this necessary? Why not just give some money to charity?"" My response is that an item like this, a vehicle tailored to each charity, is 100x more impactful than just throwing some money at a charity. Let's put it another way, would you rather just have someone give you a check for a hundred bucks, or would you like to have your favorite basketball player take a ball off the court and sign it, which would also hypothetically be worth a hundred bucks. You'd spend the cash but probably cherish the ball.It's the same with this show. The people whose lives are impacted by these vehicles and the good that they bring will forever remember meeting Renner and the crew and having this awesome portable playground, be it music, recreation, etc. Renner and co. Are forging memories for these kids, and that's worth more than just dumping some money into an organization.Genuinely lovely show.",False
2,10,Genuine Kindness and Compelling Vehicle Design,hfandre,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is an absolutely delightful. Anyone who says otherwise is probably a small minded loser who doesn't know what it means to sacrifice or provide something better for those in need. The process of re-imagining of these vehicles is very compelling to watch and the profound passion that Jeremy Renner clearly has for helping those in need is humbling. The team that Jeremy has brought together is incredible in their hard work and desire to make a new vehicle to serve the community. I am thankful that there are people like Jeremy Renner in this world who care about more than just himself, truly inspiring.",False
3,4,Below par extreme vehicle make-over mini-series,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As Episode 1 of ""Rennervations"" (2023 release; 4 episodes of about 45 min each) opens, we learn that Jeremy Renner buys up decomissioned government vehicles of all kind left and right (including lots of buses and tracks) and keeps the bunch (over 200 vehicles) in a massive lot just outside of Reno, NV. Jeremy wants to overhaul some of them so as donate them to a worthy cause. In Episode 1, Renner and his motley crew will turn a 54 ft Greyhound-reminding bus into a mobile music studio for a youth organization in Chicago. At ths point we are 5 minutes into Episodes 1.Couple of comments: I really like Renner, and he's the main reason I even gave this mini-series. A shot. I had no clue that Renner was so into music, and we watch him play piano as well as drums effortlessly. Even though the goal (to donate overhauled trucks or buses to a good cause) is commendable, in the end it is simply just the umpteenth extreme vehicle make-over show, of which there are many, many, many. Not to mention that at the tail end of Episode 1, we never even get any footage of the kids using the mobile music studio. We apparently need to just assume or imagine what hoe the mobile studio works out in day-to-day practice. Worse, as I started watching Episode 2, it felt like a complete copy of Episode 1, only now it's a city bus being turned into a mobile dance studio (for a youth group in Lox Cabos, Mexico). Halfway through Episode 2, I had had enough and I bailed. I have no intention of whatching Epsiodes 3 or 4, sorry.""Rennervations"" has been pushed heavily leading up to its premiere on Disley+ earlier this week. Of course Renner himself has been getting massive media attention due to his horrendous accident with his snow plow (this mini-series was filmed before the accident). I wish him well in his continuing recovery. For reasons unknown, Disney+ premiere 3 of t 4 episodes earlier this wee. But held back the 4th episode (presumably till next week). If you are a fan of extreme vehicle make-over shows, I'd readily suggest you approach this (with lowered expectations), and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,1,White Saviors on the Road to Heck,katharineshowalter,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJeremy Renner is okay. He's a likeable, bland, nice guy. That's his brand. And perhaps, if he is indeed the one who came up with the idea for this show, he had good intentions. Bur we know where that leads. RENNERVATIONS turns out to be just another variation of DIFF'RENT STROKES centered on the rich white male do-gooder instead of the kids. Each episode is an ADHD collection of graphics (LOTS of graphics), meh jokes, goofiness from an obnoxious partner who does what exactly?, and fake drama about the rebuild. Then the producers decide to focus on the trauma of each of the workers instead of any of the people who are supposed be needing these dramatic-but-impractical gifts that Hawkeye bestows on them. ""Just take what we give you and don't complain!"" Then, perhaps realizing how things might look, they shoe-horn in Guests of Color-Vanessa Hudgens, Anthony Mackie, Sebasti√°n Yatra, also all bland and nice-to give the proceedings an air of inclusion. It was awful about Renner's accident, and I'm glad he seems to be recovering, but Disney marketing jumped on it, must've loved that this PR opp fell right into their laps, and it had to have helped the initial ratings a bit.",True
5,2,Seriously misguided,ptrieba,n/a,16/08/2025,"The extra star in the rating is for Renner's conviction that he really is doing something good.BUT: I can't help but question the intent of this show. While every episode features a worthy cause, the solutions in form of weirdly transformed and decked out vehicles seem just so overcomplicated and unnecessary. Instead of giving these charities the money they could put to an actual good cause, it is used to fabricate XXL-pimp my rides. And these rides don't seem to be something that can be actually used on a day to day basis by the people in need. Why give kids a real dance studio like the one they used to have, when you can give them a ""mobile dance studio"" that's way too similar to party busses for drunken bachelorettes. I really doubt that these communities in need will get something out of this in the long run.In the end, it looks more like a chance for rich white dudes to give themselves a pat on the back then an honest attempt to do some good. But then again that is what Americans do best.",False
6,5,Surprisingly Boring,afariasduarte,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I saw the rating given here on the site, I thought the series was worth watching, but right from the first episode I could see that it would be a long and tedious journey. I'm not criticizing the actor's initiative to do philanthropy, I wish more Hollywood millionaires did the same, but the show itself doesn't add anything to anyone's life. It is noticeable that the series was launched to take advantage of all the visibility that the actor got with his tragic accident. Opportinistic measure and disproportionate. At most we see 4 episodes of affected people playing at saving the world. Nobody needs it. Maybe just Disney+.",False
7,1,Yawn.,graves-scott,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another ""Hey, let's A Team up some vehicle and hand it to kids who... um.. might... use them... somehow...."" show.Yawn. Didn't like the other vehicle build shows that come and go, not turning on to this one either.Kudos to Disney for not letting a disaster go to waste. Dude gets run over by a snow plow and after recovery he gets a pretty low pressure show to hopefully sell more Disney Plus subscriptions.Darn. 179 charachters left to go. Nothing much more to add about how dull and pointless this show is. I do want to see what these creations are doing in a year from now. Maybe John Stossel can do a show on celebs who mean well but inevitably fail.",False

3,1,another propaganda movie,ivicamadza,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The Weight of Chains"" by Boris Malagurski is deeply controversial and problematic for several reasons. Firstly, the director attempts to demonize Montenegro and Montenegrins in the most brutal manner, portraying them in an extremely negative light without the necessary elements for a fair portrayal of historical events.The film is filled with a vast number of historical inaccuracies, distorting reality and creating false narratives. Such an approach not only deprives viewers of an accurate picture of past events but also generates unnecessary tensions and conflicts between nations.Instead of being an objective account of historical happenings, ""The Weight of Chains"" serves as a tool for spreading misinformation and promoting the director's personal or political agenda. This is not only unprofessional but also irresponsible towards the audience, which expects accurate and reliable information from a documentary film.In short, ""The Weight of Chains"" is nothing more than propaganda that seeks to denigrate Montenegro and Montenegrins through the manipulation of historical facts. I recommend approaching such works critically and seeking reliable sources of information to create a more objective understanding of Montenegro's history and culture.",False

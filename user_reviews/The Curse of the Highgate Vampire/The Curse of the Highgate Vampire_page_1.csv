1,4,Disappointing and rather tedious,lenaluthor-66895,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerCould have been a really interesting examination of the modern mythology (it goes only back to the 1970s) of the so-called ""Highgate Vampire"" and the somewhat troubled individual who first reported it and then sank so deeply into the world of paranormal investigation and the occult it broke up his young family. Instead, we get lots of Travel Channel-level footage of people running around in the cemetery at night (illegal at Highgate, btw) claiming to capture glimpses of the entity and to hear it ""speak"" via static-y EVPs. So-called ""illustrative"" historical footage is heavy used, which is just a nice way to say ""completely unrelated footage but we needed to show you *something* or we wouldn't have a film."" Everybody interviewed has a claim about the vampire/ghost/demon/whatever but like all such docs, the ultimate findings are, no surprise, inconclusive.",True

1,7,Emotional and Inspiring,haleyyoung-44833,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie made me emotional at times. They did a good job selecting candidates that are likable. I wish they had gone more in depth on the secondary characters.,False
2,10,Beautifully Done,dougwhite-28538,n/a,16/08/2025,"Showing the struggles and perseverance of these kids to achieve their dreams at GSEA was so touching and real. Each one with their own set of challenges put my own world into perspective. The only aprt I didn't agree with the glossing over of why Henry was stopped and not allowed into Macau the first time. It highlighted that he was the only candidate stopped and not allowed in, and he was also the only Africa candidate of the group featured. That experience of being turned away because of your skin color could have been extrapolated on a little more. Its a real human experience.",False

The stories are highly emotive, resulting in tears of happiness in many different scenes.I'd recommend this to any lover of documentaries, anyone in need of positivity and anyone who is a natural entrepreneur. Above all, though, I recommend this film to young families. There are so many clear reminders that pursuing your passion and creativity are not bound by gender, race, geography, etc.Go enjoy this film, but be warned...you may feel intense motivation to go start a business afterwards!",False
6,10,A better title: Student Entrepreneurs Changing the World,sarahrivera-47018,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows the incredible, innovative minds of today's international youth hoping to build a better future for our world.

8,9,Exciting & Emotional,ajalhan,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story of five entrepreneurs from very different parts of the world that took small thoughts and turned them into big ideas. The five people talk openly about the ups and downs they've faced in their journeys which really highlights the importance of perseverance (just listen for Henry's story). By the end of the film, it was hard not to become emotionally attached to each person and wish the very best for them. I have a feeling this won't be the last we hear about some of these people. Definitely recommend watching!",False

19,10,Electrifying! A beautiful storyline,marinakats-86698,n/a,16/08/2025,Electrifying! The documentary follows 5 different people who are globally so distanced. The individuals come together for GSEA Global Finals in Macau and you can't help but feel so utterly connected to their stories and mission. They each strive to bring an entrepreneurial opportunity to life. Immigration and displacement are a common theme as ultimately they come from towns and villages where people have fled and immigrated from yet they felt a sense of connection of staying and linking the pursuit of their work to higher goals. Where we come from does not define where we are going - this quote rings true throughout the entire film! 5 stars all around! Beautifully captures and a riveting storyline from the start.This documentary showcases that youth are not lost - they are indeed the ones pushing the limits.,False
20,10,Great for parents and their teens to watch together,vqvrpn,n/a,16/08/2025,"As our families sit at home during COVID and dream about the things we wish we could do, Own the Room reminds young people (and their parents) of the possibilities that their future could bring with dedication and passion. It doesn't matter what your background is, what continent you come from, or who your parents are.We watched Own the Room with our teenage boys, and were hooked by each of the stories. A mix of entrepreneurial, cultural and geopolitical stories with drama and some sad reality playing through to the end. Strong young women and men individually working with their passions, but sharing their experiences and successes.Definitely recommended especially to families with children old enough to dream about their future.",False

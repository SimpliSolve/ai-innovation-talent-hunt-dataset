2,10,"Tininess through disaster, greatness through struggles",kejinlee,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thank you for making this documentary, it's fabulous!! It touched me so deeply when I saw the tininess of men through disaster and their greatness through struggles. I also saw an immigrant who could fight for justice but could also forbear all these traumatized memories alone after being a father. Although carrying heavy memories, these survivors still lived their ordinary life, generation after generation. For such a well-made documentary, it's really a pity that the showtime is so limited here in the mainland of China. I do hope more people can be witnesses so the truth would be more meaningful. As a teacher, I will definitely recommend this documentary to my student to help them think more deeply about racism and anti-immigration policy. Thank you all again for your meaningful research!",False
3,10,Never believed a documentary could be so entertaining while also fascinating,tienruay,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film keeps you totally engrossed through the sheer process of discovery. It is a film about surviving, about tenaciousness and about the dark side of racism and policies like the Chinese Exclusion Act. It is also about families and their journeys. Emotionally rewarding and beautifully filmed. Highly recommended.",False

5,10,Very moving,safenoe,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis poignant and moving documentary about six Chinese survivors of the Titanic is a documentary for the times. Shame on those in power who imposed the Chinese Exclusion Act as part of the racist policies to shut out the Chinese who, as James Cameron emotionally described in a guest appearance, ""built the damn railways which formed the backbone of this country"".The final scene was very moving, with the descendant of one of the Chinese survivors meeting a descendant of one of the British survivors who rescued the Chinese survivor.",True

7,10,Truly Incredible!,chowjasmine,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have written and edited this review almost 5 times in my notes because it's hard to put into words how incredible this was. I was amazed at the ability for the researchers and cast to connect all this information and tell the story of such strength and courage. I have immense respect and gratitude to all the people involved in this production for their attention to detail and willingness to commit to revealing and sharing with the world such an important part of history. As I sat watching, I felt moved and overcome with so much emotion and awe. I left feeling so inspired and in awe of the human spirit and those who produced this incredible film. The director, Arthur Jones seems like such a down to earth person, and his talent is something I truly admire. Thank you to all involved for sharing this story with the world! I have written so much, but I mean every word. I have actually never written a review for anything before, but it truly was incredible and I could not recommend it enough!!Thank you!",False
8,10,The power of research!,markpallis,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was great. Like many, I had no idea about this story, and I loved feeling part of the twists and turns of trying to get to the bottom of the mystery. There is a delightful honesty to the storytelling. Very well worth a watch.",False

11,10,Cannot stopping tearing,pengzheng-01707,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAs mentioned, the shipwreck is just a bumpy road to Fang Lang's life. The story of Mr. Fang at anti-Chinese decades is layed out in front of me. I read briefly on the history of exclusion of Chinese but would never understand how it falls heavily on individuals. Thank you so much for the brilliant work of research and documentary.From the poem of Fang Lang, I read his sadness and condolence to his friends' death. They have planned a hell of a future ahead while the shipwreck and exclusion have changed everything. Sending letters/money back to his friends' families is a common way in traditional Chinese values that survivors take care of victim friends' families. No wonder he was trying all to make his track close to his original plan and live a humble life ever since.In my opinion, both Lang and Rongshan are his names. Lang could be the given name, MING, it is a name generally given by parents and generally only called by parents while Rongshan is his another set of name ZI, which, I guess, given by the teacher/elders and used more in daily life.There was a kinda famous person's name is similar, YE BILANG(lang as part of the given name) ZI RONGSHAN (Rongshan as more commonly used name). Re: why he changed his name from Lang to Rongshan, I vaguely remember my grandpa (born in 1920) did something similar when both his parents died (no one would call his MING since then).",True
12,10,An ADHD review,laurahatt-81398,n/a,15/08/2025,"I normally do not like documentaries as I lose focus on 1 of 2 parts of it. The 1st part is the information. Trying to listen on what is being said, hearing it, taking it in, and understanding it without losing focus because of the pictures on the screen and also being able to process it before hearing the next thing said. Then you have the 2nd part which is the pictures and video. Taking in the photos, the view, processing it and seeing the details, seeing what the director wants you to focus on and everything else that draws your eye naturally. Seeing and judging every person that comes on the screen, people that you may never meet but their information is important. Seeing the landscape in the background, places you may never go and only having this chance to learn from these people and seeing these places because you may never have the opportunity but also because this movie is not out in the US at this time. Will it ever be? I hope so. I would love to have a copy to watch over and over learning something new about these amazing men from these amazing producers. This copy we watched was Steven's copy, our one chance at this time to learn about The Six. It was powerful, educational, and laid out so well that I could hold my focus and take in the video and the commentary at the same time. I hope the movie and book gets released in the US one day. It is sad to think that this may be something I will never be able to share with my husband David. I can tell him about the movie and explain somewhat but I would never be able to recall it all or give him the feelings, the emotions, the satisfaction of a mystery coming together. Only the movie can do that. I highly recommend this movie. For any history buff or Titanic buff, this movie is not something you want to miss. Thank you to Steven Schwankert for sharing it with our group.",False
13,10,"""This is a highly underrated documentary.""",theyesman-14643,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had been looking forward to this documentary ever since I saw the trailer, even before it was officially released.But I couldn't find a source to watch it online at the time, so I never got around to it-and eventually forgot about it.It wasn't until five years after its release that I came across it by chance.First of all, I truly appreciate the way this documentary was filmed-digging through a sea of archives to uncover clues.As someone who's also passionate about online research, I never stop at the surface of a story. I always go deeper, scouring the internet for data and records.For example, when researching Jack the Ripper, I look into 19th-century British culture, the life stories of each victim, the exact locations, old maps and sketches-trying to piece it all together.If I had the money and time, I would also love to investigate mysteries through fieldwork, just like in the film.What's more, the documentary powerfully conveyed the harsh conditions that Chinese people faced at the time-their struggles for survival, and the challenges that shaped their lives.With the Chinese Exclusion Act and the clearing out of Chinatowns in the U. S. and U. K., they were left with nowhere to go.They were forced to drift between nations.The film could have gone further by including some narrative from China itself. After all, the Titanic sank in 1912-the same year the Qing dynasty collapsed.Under the rule of the Qing government, ordinary people were already living under extremely difficult conditions.For example, when the Macartney Embassy came to China, Vice Ambassador John Barrow wrote in his diary about an incident:
Because they were unfamiliar with the route from Guangzhou to Tianjin, the British asked local officials for help finding a navigator who had been to Tianjin.In response, the officials simply ordered soldiers to round up any civilians who had ever been there.Those people were forced to their knees, miserable and terrified.Later, when the embassy ships entered the inland waterways, soldiers forced large numbers of civilians to pull the boats by rope-but paid them almost nothing.Many tried to escape.So the officials sent soldiers into nearby villages to drag people out of bed to join the towing teams.To stop them from running away, soldiers carrying long whips watched over them constantly-as if these civilians were not people, but beasts of burden.Under such brutal conditions, a few Chinese people traveled overseas, only to face more discrimination.Before the Chinese Exclusion Act in the U. S., economic depression already made Chinese workers-who were seen as hard-working and willing to do jobs others wouldn't-easy scapegoats.Years of being treated like oxen or horses made this rejection almost inevitable.Then came the world wars, which gave them a temporary value-as fuel for the machine-but once the wars were over, they were discarded and returned to a state of displacement.Even surviving the Titanic did not change their circumstances.As the saying goes, every grain of sand from history, when it lands on an individual, becomes a mountain.I created an account just to leave this comment. I want to say that this is a truly remarkable documentary.It offers a different perspective on the Titanic-one that goes beyond the historical event itself.This film represents a reflective narrative that attempts to advance human values, and that, to me, is part of what makes Western societies admirable:
their willingness to reflect on the past, to confront mistakes, and to have people who stand up to correct them-even when the story is about something as seemingly small as six Chinese men.The value of this documentary does not depend on how many people watch it.Its significance stands on its own.""This comment was translated using machine translation-please pardon any inaccuracies in the phrasing.""",False

1,8,The bonds we make,siderite,n/a,17/08/2025,"Decades ago, as a child, I read a book about a guy who befriends an octopus, becoming aware of its intelligence and curiosity and then having to live through the drama of his friend dying. My Octopus Teacher is basically the same thing, only it's a documentary. Octopi are marvelous creatures, both in their weird biology and their incredible intelligence. Numerous anecdotes have them use tools, enjoy beauty and create artistic work, be able to personally connect to the people they encounter. That is amazing from a completely non social creature that can rarely live more than a year. In terms of intelligence, no animal or man comes close in that small time span.But these are just facts. The documentary is a personal account from a guy who by chance became fascinated with such a creature and spent a year diving underwater without a wetsuit or an oxygen tank and studying it, earning its trust and caring about it. You can see, in his narration, how difficult it was to just keep the distance necessary to observe the life of the octopus and not become part of it. There are scenes when the creature jumps on his hand and then explores his chest, cradling to it and accepting warmth and petting. It is that personal approach to the documentary which makes is so powerful.Bottom line: this is the story of the life of one specimen of Octopus Vulgaris, as narrated and video documented by the film maker. The images are very beautiful and the account personal and lacking the fillers or pointless flourishings of common documentaries. The viewer is drawn into the life of this amazing creature. It's a good film.",False
2,9,"Excellent, Empathetic, and Incredible Cinematography",unbrokenconstraint,n/a,17/08/2025,"There's not much to say about this documentary type movie. It show cases an animal that's one of the most intelligent creatures we know and interacting with it, in its own environment. I was pretty shocked by how much personality the octopus showed, and intelligence. It gives you such a large level of empathy and love for a creature that's so alien looking compared to a regular pet (a dog or a cat).Definitely needed this in 2020. Would recommend this for anyone that enjoys the sea, or really, anyone.",False
3,9,Love,jszeliga-84852,n/a,17/08/2025,"A truly touching story of two species connecting on a level that is unknown to most. Animals are the greatest teachers out there, and what a blessing it is to connect with such an extraordinary creature. This just goes to show no matter how unlikely the connection, love can exist in any form.",False
4,10,Wow!,bernalbee,n/a,17/08/2025,"As I sit here in my living room with the 'very unhealthy smoke' outside (from all the rampant PNW fires) I turned on Netflix and saw this Documentary. I thought Hmmm...that looks good. I was immersed from the get go. 23 minutes into it I paused it and had to text all my friends and tell them to watch it. I just put a post on Facebook to please watch this incredible film. It was one the THE very BEST documentaries I have ever watched. I always knew the octopus was smart but this film reminded me how smart. The bond between the octopus and filmmaker were beyond amazing. See this film now. And tell all your friends. There are important messages to take away from this documentary and we need to share those messages. We are part of this earth. Not just visitors. By the way, this is my first ever review. I felt compelled to write one after seeing this movie.",False
5,10,Stunning Documentary,lnolan68,n/a,17/08/2025,"Everyone do yourself a favour and watch this beautiful documentary about Craig Foster and the wonderful relationship he had with an octopus. It highlights how highly intelligent these beautiful creatures are.

6,10,Most Touching Documentary I've Ever Watched,elliott-57761,n/a,17/08/2025,"I just finished watching this at around 1AM by myself and was able to give it my full attention. It was easily one of the top 3 documentaries I've ever watched and certainly the most touching.Our narrator and freediving host searches for strength and purpose to continue on in life and in doing so learns deep lessons in unlikely places.My favorite thing about this documentary is the level of new scientific discovery that coincide with the narrators own emotional and universal development. I'm a sucker for anything that aims to prove our deep connection with the wild and the universe.This one struck a chord in my heart and had my eyes welling up at the beauty of life on a couple occasions. BravoElliott Osborne, 35, Chicago",False
7,10,Stunning,tyagarak,n/a,17/08/2025,"What a beautiful film. Behind all the stunning imagery, emotion and story is the relentless discipline to dive every day for 5 years and then discover this bond over a year in freezing cold water. I have been to the kelp forest and gone into the water. To hold ones breath and be still to capture such astonishing beauty over such a long period of time is nothing but remarkable. In an age of staged nature films the simplicity and authenticity of the story is brilliant.",False
8,n/a,You'll fall in love with her just as he did. You'll love this masterpiece doc as well.,n/a,n/a,17/08/2025,"""A lot of people say an octopus is like an alien. But the strange thing is, as you get closer to them, you realize that we're very similar in a lot of ways."" Craig Foster, Founder of Sea Change ProjectA lot of people come to an undersea doc caring mainly for the spectacular cinemaphotography. Not so much here because the Netflix original, My Octopus Teacher, is all about the relationship between an invertebrate and a man--the photography helps rather than dominates.Herman Melville could have learned a thing or two from narrator and diver Craig Foster, whose gentle delivery draws you in the way his octopus love does. Melville could have minimized most of his delivery, whereas Foster and co-writer James Reed gently tell us about this lovely miniature wonder and her world in the simplest, most lyrical way.She soothes us with her daily routine (Foster spends almost a year observing her without scuba tank (a year is the lifespan of the Octopus). She coyly draws him in like a lover. If you have your Octopus knowledge only from Jules Verne, you be astonished how small she is and loving-at one point, Foster caresses her, revealing how small she is, and vulnerable. Yet, she trusts him as well she should. See this masterpiece just to witness him lovingly holding her.Foster adheres to the Star-Trek non-intervention mandate and watches how his beloved aqua woman is pursued by a hungry shark. Drama ensues with a slow-burning suspense most horror films would love to have.You are likely to experience the mental cleansing the narrator did as he lost his depression, connected with his son, and found his place in the natural world, and thus the human world, while he became more intimate with her and her small world:""What she taught me was to feel... that you're part of this place, not a visitor. That's a huge difference."" Foster",False
9,7,"Morally Grey, but Emotionally Effective",PyroSikTh,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerCraig Foster is a filmmaker who was going through a particularly rough patch in his life. As a coping mechanism he decided to go diving in the nearby ocean. What he found under the surface revolutionised the way he viewed the world and our role in it. This is, fundamentally, what My Octopus Teacher is about; what our role in this world is as humans. It's not a nature documentary, and in fact what we see and learn about the titular octopus isn't really important. Over the course of a year, diving down into the kelp forest every day, he documented the life and death of a singular octopus. He grew unhealthily attached to it, but it opened his eyes to the fact that humans are not separate from the natural world. We're as much a part of it as the octopus is.The main reason that this movie isn't really about the octopus is that the facts offered are flimsy at best, and do not come from any form of authority. In fact we get the opposite. Foster constantly humanises this animal, describing its behaviour as if it were a child. The documentary is shot and edited to support this narrative as well, but instead of educating on how octopuses live, it instead creates an emotional attachment for us. The wild octopus is depicted akin to a pet in its significance to Foster's life. I cuddle my cat the same way Foster is shown cuddling the octopus. I humanise my cat the same way Foster humanises the octopus. But my cats behaviour is not the same as a human beings, and neither is the octopus. Did the octopus see Foster as a friend? Or did it see him as a watchful guardian? An annoyance? Just a point of curiosity? Foster depicts the relationship as platonic, but it's unlikely the octopus had the same perspective.Beyond the educational deceptions this humanising presents, it also creates a polarising narrative. Some people are enamoured with the relationship and message, watching this guy grow closer to nature and befriending its inhabitants. Others blame him for interfering and/or not interfering enough, or profiting (emotionally) from a wild animal. In both cases these people have been sucked into the humanised narrative and created an adequate emotional response to it. Where do I lie? Definitely the former, but why is highlighted by the latter. The message of the documentary is that humans are part of nature, and not separate from it as most of us often live. This is undeniably true, but it raises an interesting question as to how far we should or should not interfere in the natural world.Was Foster interfering by just being there? If so, why did he draw a line at not interfering when the octopus was being attacked? Biologists often say that when interacting with wildlife, you need to be respectful of it. Would it have been respectful of Foster to beat the sharks away? To the octopus, maybe, but definitely not to the sharks. While he depicts the octopus as a friend or a pet, he's quite obviously aware that that is not the case, and it is not his place to protect her from predators. What about just being there and filming? Maybe he got a bit too close, both emotionally and physically, but beyond that, how was that interference different to that of professional nature documentarists and scientists studying animals? And if we really are as much a part of nature as Foster suggests, is it really interfering at all? There's such a fine line here, and I'm not arrogant enough to suggest I have the answer and can declare who's right and who's wrong.On a purely technical merit, My Octopus Teacher succeeds in just about every way. The cinematography is fantastic, most of which done by Foster himself, from the footage he filmed over that year-long period. The humanised narrative he depicts is, I admit, very effective as well, warming us to the octopus so much it causes the discussions above. Whether you were a supporter of the friendship or had issue with Foster's behaviour, we can all agree that we loved that octopus and was rooting for it right until the very end. It reaching out and for physical contact was more than likely curiosity or a form of self-preservation on the octopuses behalf, but it's hard not to view it as the first connection and loving embraces of a budding friendship. And because of all of this, the film's gut-punch ending is so emotionally effective. Regardless of the morals of this documentary, you can't deny it's a very well-crafted film.My Octopus Teacher is not a film I would blindly recommend to people, even if just because of its divisive nature. But the message it's trying to tell is universal and needs to be heard by as many people as possible. If My Octopus Teacher manages to reach people other similar efforts wouldn't have done, then I can only deem it a success. We live on this world. We're a part of it. Everything we do affects the world around us. We have a responsibility to preserve it, not because the animals deserve it (it's called natural selection for a reason), but because we are it. We are not disconnected. The world affects us as much as we affect it. Foster came into this octopus' life and affected it one way or another, but the octopus affected his life as well. We are not above the natural world just because we're smarter and have opposable thumbs. I give My Octopus Teacher an effective but morally grey 7/10.",True
10,8,Mixed Reactions,evanston_dad,n/a,17/08/2025,"I had mixed reactions to this documentary about a man's love for an octopus. I've seen a lot of reviewers complain that it's yet one more story about a self-absorbed privileged white guy whining about his white person problems and making the underwater natural world all about himself. I can see how people might react to the movie that way I guess, but I didn't feel that way while watching it. Instead, I thought it was a visually breathtaking film about our relationship with and responsibility to the natural world. The way he approached his subject didn't seem that intrusive to me, and there were several moments where he explicitly said he did not interfere with nature even when he wanted to because he didn't want to upset the natural balance. I thought this film was a good reminder that we co-exist with the natural world and it's to mankind's benefit to respect it and try to understand it, if for no other reason than that our lives depend on it.And and can I just say that the octopus may just be one of the most fascinating creatures on the face of the earth?Grade: A-",False
11,7,Octopus learns not to count on human,futuretype,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerExemplary footage but misplaced trust. The filmmaker got many things out of the encounter including the trust of the octopus but didn't reciprocate the one way exchange rationalizing it was okay to watch its demise. Why couldn't he give back and try to chase off the shark to see if the bond might have been stronger. We think its okay when dolphins save humans from sharks or orcas, why not save creatures in turn?",True
12,10,To the guy who said he can't believe he cried over an octopus - SAME! BEAUTIFUL MOVIE.,edendadi,n/a,17/08/2025,"I just know I can't put into words how I feel about this movie, or even try to explain it. I literally cried over this. All I have to say is that it's a must. Such a beautiful story, such smart creatures.",False
13,7,Dimwitted Man Almost Learns Empathy,hallsi-12460,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis man spent months building a bond with an octopus, who reached out and demonstrated actual joy and affection upon seeing him... and then traded in that trust to get riveting footage of the octopus being mauled.... He said he *almost* felt like he should protect her, but that he wouldn't want to interfere with nature. You already interfered with nature by befriending this animal. If you bonded with a dog, would you just watch while the dog got brutalized, as the dog makes eye contact with you and runs up to you for help? This is the same thing. You had an understanding. The octopus used to rush up to him and actually hug him. After the betrayal, she never went up to touch him ever again. This creature was obviously bonded. She went out to spend time with him. She had her guard down in a way that she wouldn't have if she didn't have a (supposed) friend there. This was a beautiful and amazing connection, and you traded it in for interesting footage. Was it worth it?As he was discussing their connection, he kept reminding himself that she was ""only a mollusk."" He is the mollusk. Is it really a revelation that animals can think and care and are worthy of value and consideration? He came so very close to getting the point. I hope it keeps him up at night. Congratulations; you got some great shots.",True
14,1,Friendship marked by cruelty,anna_utex,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile I found the parts of the documentary about the octopus to be extraordinary, the human side of it made me sick. His blatant failure to help the octopus on numerous occasions after establishing a friendship with it was just cruel! He's not a marine biologist. He didn't sign a pledge not to interfere with nature, those decisions were his own and completely unnecessary. If our pets are threatened or injured we don't just stand back and let them be killed or scavenged. If we see a wild animal struggling most people try to help if they can. How he could watch that remarkable animal suffer so greatly and not offer assistance is beyond me.I found him to be extremely self absorbed and annoying. I'm not sure why some people liked this so much. There are hundreds of nature documentaries with beautiful footage that don't include the human betrayal of a trusting animal.",True
15,8,One of the most beautiful looking documentaries I have seen for some time.,MOscarbradley,n/a,17/08/2025,"If ""My Octopus Teacher"" does win the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature as predicted, (it's already won the BAFTA), I don't think I'll be complaining even if I think ""Collective"" the better film and the more worthy winner but that's only because ""Collective"" tells the more important story and is the more radical film. ""My Octopus Teacher"" is fairly radical, too, and as documentary filmmaking goes it's a beautiful job of work with some of the finest 'natural' cinematography I've ever seen, (""Blue Planet"" eat your heart out).It even has a plot of sorts and two leading players. One is Craig Foster, an explorer and cinematographer whose daily dives to a kelp forest in the seas off South Africa leads him to the films second character, a female octopus that Foster becomes very attached to and who, it would appear, becomes very attached to him, literally at times. Octopuses, it turns out, are highly intelligent creatures and Foster's octopus seems more intelligent than most, an 'alien' creature that can recognize an individual human being and want to be with that human, albeit in her own natural environment.Of course, the octopus is also a wild animal in a wild, natural environment and much as he might want to Foster knows he can do nothing to change that; as we say, he has to let nature take its course while at the same time allowing himself to be 'taught' by the octopus, taught not just to care about the octopus itself but creatures in general and, strange as it may seem, interacting with this creature brough Foster closer to his own son. Superbly photographed and edited, its only falut lies in Foster's rather deadpan narration. He may be a nice guy but is somewhat dull in his delivery; luckily his camera speaks volumes.",False

17,9,Unbelievable,Patroni556,n/a,17/08/2025,This film redefines the documentary genre. The film touched me more than 99% of all films and was more exciting than the best thriller.

18,9,Absolutely Beautiful,valleyjohn,n/a,17/08/2025,"What a beautiful film .This is the kind of nature documentary movie that makes you realise what a wonderful world we live in and how animals have a sense of innocence and beauty that most adult humans sadly lose .After years of swimming every day in the freezing ocean at the tip of Africa, Craig Foster meets an unlikely teacher a young octopus who displays remarkable curiosity. Visiting her den and tracking her movements for months on end he eventually wins the animal's trust and they develop a never before seen bond between human and wild animal.It's amazing that a creature like an octopus , and a wild one at that , can show trust in a human.Craig Foster said that he fell in love with this octopus and the story is told so well that viewer does as well.It's hard to imagine a creature like this being so intelligent but it genuinely is.This just won a BAFTA for best documentary and is nominated for an Oscar and it's hard to believe there is a better film out there can pip this film to the award.Absolutely Brilliant.",False

The mere fact that we both want to connect, just shows that there is a stronger connection between us and the animal kingdom than most of us realize. Absolute must watch...",False
20,6,Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but...,stephenstephenbyrne,n/a,17/08/2025,The octopus itself and its anthropomorphised story is gripping but the guy is so wrapped up in himself and his own epic journey it ultimately ends up feeling quite self serving.,False
21,9,Octopus vulgaris nominated for an Oscar,Red-125,n/a,17/08/2025,"My Octopus Teacher (2020) was co-written and co-directed by Pippa Ehrlich
and James Reed.It stars Craig Foster and a female octopus that lives in the frigid waters at the southern tip of South Africa. (Craig's son, Tom, has a small role.)After Foster finds the octopus, he visits her den every day--literally. After a while she becomes accustomed to his presence, and appears to accept him as a companion. (It's very difficult to avoid anthropmorphism when watching a nature film. However, I was convinced that there really was two-way relationship between the human and the invertebrate.For the record, I don't usually enjoy nature films. I liked this one because of the interaction between human and octopus. (It's the same reason I like Bronx Zoo--it's as much about humans interacting with animals as it is about the animals themselves.)My Octopus Teacher has a strong IMDb rating of 8.2. I agreed and rated it 9.P. S. My close friend told me I'd like ""the octopus movie."" I dutifully looked for that movie, and found a science-fiction movie about a giant octopus that could entrap and sink huge ships. This movie is not that movie.",False
22,7,Beautiful story but disappointing,bandini2,n/a,17/08/2025,SpoilerI won't inflict the storyline on everyone all over again as it has now been covered many times but I felt a sense of betrayal at the end. During their friendship there were moments of great tenderness which bridged an abyss between two worlds that couldn't have been more different. Maybe the first time this has ever happened in the history of this earth. The beautiful moments when she reached out to him and felt secure on his arm or chest and then at the end when she needed him the most he watches her begin a night of being eaten alive by every nibbler in the sea! What kind of crap is that. Are we Capt Kirk now and the Starfleet Directive to never interfere? He goes back to his cozy beach house and feels sorry for himself. This film left me angry.,True
23,10,Captivating story.,thinusgroen,n/a,17/08/2025,"Loved everything about this amazing documentary.

24,7,A good lesson to animals: humans are not to be trusted,thedashness,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerAs another reviewer rightly said, Craig is a brilliant film maker and a lousy friend.This is an incredibly moving story of a beautiful, highly intelligent creature who let a human into her world, only to have him watch her die a gruesomely slow death while he pontificates on his own ""struggles"". To those (and Craig!) saying that this is nature and that he didn't want to interfere, the time to draw that line was before developing such a close relationship that she would leave her place of safety to go and cuddle up to him, certainly before she altered her natural behaviour and started using him as an assistant in her hunting and seeing him as a source of safety. At that point, his protestations of not wanting to interfere to preserve ""natural balance!"" are nothing more than a pathetic excuse for wanting a good shot of that heartbreaking final scene. The least he could have done after irrevocably altering her entire existence was give her a peaceful death.This is a brilliant film, made at the price of a wonderful creature's trust.",True
25,1,Horribly Callous and Narcissistic Documentary,sarahehallmark,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is such a depressing movie, and I cannot believe that anyone would enjoy watching this. I wish I could take away stars!This guys spent months creating a bond with a very intelligent creature only to allow her to be malled by a shark and then watch her die alone while being eaten by other fish, but at least he got his documentary out of it.He clearly did not truly care about anyone but himself and was able to show that through his words and actions. He literally only talked about what he was going through and how he felt. What?! She was basically his pet at that point and he did nothing but watch her be tortured due to his selfishness.He claimed that she was his friend.. I would sure hate to be his friend, what a a selfish prick.He cared more about getting a good shot than keeping her safe, when she came out of her normal areas to spend time with him. He put her in clear danger and then allowed her to get hurt.Karma is a b. I hope he doesn't come back as an octopus.P. S. Do not watch unless you want yet another reason to punch someone in the neck.",True

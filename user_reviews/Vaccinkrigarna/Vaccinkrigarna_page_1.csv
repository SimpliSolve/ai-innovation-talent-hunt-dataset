1,10,"A fascinating, thorough look into the anti-vaccine movement",Wistfull,n/a,16/08/2025,"Two Swedish journalists decide to go undercover into the international anti-vaccine scene. Under the guise of making a vaccine critical documentary they get to interview the biggest names in the movement, including Linda Karlstr√∂m in the Nordics, and Andrew Wakefield in the United States.Alongside these interviews they talk to a vaccine hesitant mother to understand her point of view, as well as Swedish health professionals who discuss the history of vaccines and how they work.This documentary series is particularly good because of its tone - it's neither sensationalist, nor ridiculing, but instead seeks to understand why and how the anti-vaccine ideas have emerged and spread. Because of the subterfuge that the journalists opted for, they get to talk with the antivaxxers in good faith, and are able to portray their thoughts and viewpoints without the hostility that would surely be there if they were aware of the journalists' opposing views. This results in a very human portrayal.Despite the warm tone, the documentary goes in hard on the facts and leaves no ambiguity when it comes to the motivations and consequences of the antivax movement. A very eye-opening watch, if you haven't already delved into this issue.",False

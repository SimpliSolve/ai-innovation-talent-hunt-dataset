1,8,Riveting look at the criminal justice reform movement in Philadelphia,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As Episode 1 of ""Philly D. A."" (2021 release; 8 episodes of about 55 min. Each) opens, it is ""January, 2018"" and Larry Krasner, a lifelong civil rights and criminal defense lawyer, is being sworn in as Philadelphia's new District Attorney. We sit in on the ""First Policy Meeting"" of Krasner and his closest advisors, and immediately they are discussing changes that previously would've been unthinkable, so to alleviate the mass incarceration that has been going on for decades. Along the way we are informed that Philly is the most incarcerated big city in the US, which of course is the most incarcerated country in the world. We then go to ""April, 2017"", where we learn that the previous D. A. has been indicted for corruption and hence it is now an open seat that attracts a lot of interest from across the spectrum. At this point we are 10 min. Into the opening episode...Couple of comments: this is the latest project from co-directors Ted Passon and Yoni Brook. Going by the initial 2 episodes that I've seen so far, it looks very much like the production team was given unfettered access to Larry Krasner both before but more importantly also after his election. The latter is of course the key to this riveting documentary series. While Episode 1 focuses on the run up to and the immediate aftermath of the election, Episode 2 focuses on how and what Krasner and his team are going about to change the criminal justice system. But I do want to mention a memorable quote from the run up to the election. When the GOP candidate for D. A. says that ""this is not a time for a social experiment"", Krasner retorts: ""The mass incarceration that has been going on for 30 years was a social experiment!"". In Episode 2, tensions between the D. A.'s office and the Philadelphia Police Department immediately start running high, including the discovery of a list of ""bad cops"" which the previous D. A. willingly kept from the public... I can't wait to see how all of this is going to shake out in the remaining episodes.""Philly D. A."" premiered this week on PBS and the initial two episodes are now available on PBS On Demand. New episodes air on Tuesdays at 9 pm Eastern. If you have any interest in criminal justice issues or simply want to see a documentary that is nothing short of riveting and eye-opening on so many levels, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
2,7,Partisan but heartfelt,paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"America's justice system is shockingly punitive, often driven by proescutors elected for their promises to be ""tough on crime."" But an increasing number of cities, including Philadelphia, have started to elected liberal D. A.s. This programme profiles Larry Krasner as he tries to reform his city's approach to prosecuting crime. His approach is porttayed by his many enemies as letting the criminals off; but in my opinion, it's both more humane, and likely to be long-term more effective. The series is unquestionanbly partisan; some of Krasner's opponents come accross as monstrous, and no-one is allowed to articulate on camera specific things that Kranser might have done wrong. Even when some long standing prosecutors are fired because they don't fir the new regime, we never learn exactly what their points of disagreement with the boss are. In some ways, the lack of even-handedness weakens the case for what Kranser is doing; but then maybe the old ways were simply indefensible. In any case, it's an important series, given America's continuing racial and economic divisions, and the role that the state plays in defending and re-enforcing them.",False
3,8,Change Isn't Easy When You're Trying to Fix an Entire System,hayley96,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis review is based on the first two episodes. You can read anywhere that Larry Krasner staged a shocking landslide victory to assume the head of the Philadelphia DA's office in 2017. This sort of thing actually happens quite a bit in local government - the old DA retires or gets a judgeship or federal job and the new person decides to shake things up. What is interesting here is the size of the office - over 300 lawyers - and Krasner's stated intent to reform the local criminal justice system.So, we see staff ""that don't fit"" fired and new, progressive unit heads brought in as well as political advisors (called policy advisors but they are clearly Krasner's political people in the office) pushing an agenda of upending the system. It is clear from the these two episodes that hold over attorneys who tell the producers that they can work with the new bosses are in for a brutal awakening.Particularly hard to watch is the attorneys in the juvenile justice section. Lisa Harvey and her colleagues have the delicate job of balancing victim's rights while recommending punishment for young offenders. Bill, their new boss wants to reduce the number of offenders in detention without a clear plan to accomplish that other than simply picking two kids every day to send home. Lisa doesn't see it but anyone who has ever worked at a business taken over in a merger can see where this story ends - with the holdovers leaving by choice or being pushed out.Krasner is a hard guy to like. He is the epitome of ""move fast break things."" He has the financial security - his wife is a judge and their kids are grown that if this doesn't work out he's either beat in an election or doesn't run again and he's okay. This is not true for the rest of the office and the people impacted by his policies.",True
4,10,Wow - Wow - Wow Thoroughly Impressed with Larry!,littlelasita,n/a,15/08/2025,"This appealed to me, because my legal beginnings was with the district attorney's office in Delaware. It helped me to appreciate more those who have dedicated their lives and genuinely care about upholding what's right. I am blown away by Larry. I feel given sitting through 8 episodes we are on a first name basis, but he is truly a forward thinking person, and HE MAKES SENSE. The unwillingness of those to make an effort to fix the system versus collecting a paycheck, whether that's inside the attorney general's office (hence the cleaning in the beginning - but as Larry said, he should have let more go, to police, to defenders), such actions all contribute to an archaic, discriminatory system continuing to exist and damaging lives. Where's the humanity in that? So stop and really listen to what he is saying and trying to do, and more importantly support. As he has said he welcomes feedback, ideas, discussions on making the system better instead of letting it continue in its crippled/crippling state. I can see how the message can get lost based on the messenger as he is a direct, no non-sense person, but I concur with councilwoman Maria Q Sanchez, Larry does care. And his care is so deep-rooted and again genuine that he's trying to accomplish some worthy and good things in a short amount of time, which causes him at times to cut straight to the message and not wrap it in a bunch of bs. Coupled with certain moments in filming you see him get choked up and is brought to tears. That's not acting - that is someone who is trying to make a difference!I have been so impressed by the way this documentary has been presented and the subject matter that I have purchased Larry's book - For The People. I want to know more, and I am looking forward to the read.Please consider viewing this - with an open mind and really listen - listen to the science and the plan to embed in Philadelphia's criminal system a worthwhile way of solving some of the problems (which in my opinion are all moral based). Much success in your endeavors Mr. Krasner.",False
5,10,Can We Change a Completely Broken System?,leftbanker-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"""It's nice to have power instead of outrage.""Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner.Brilliant!I haven't lived in the USA for a while, so forgive me if this is all new news for me. I was hooked from the very first scene in which Krasner and his team are in the process of ending ""stupid"" which in this case consisted of completely draconian laws regarding victimless crimes (minor drug possession and prostitution).Krasner's basic philosophy is to end incarceration for petty crimes and use the money for other, more beneficial programs. If anyone still believes that we aren't putting enough people in jail in America, perhaps they would be more comfortable living in a dictatorship?Krasner just seems like a really decent human being. He has been married to the same woman for three decades. He is committed and idealistic. OMG, the conservatives must totally hate him for that.Ever since I was probably sixteen years old, I've felt that where a person stands on the death penalty is a litmus test for character and consistency. Krasner ran and won partly on his views against capital punishment. Obviously, many people in Philadelphia agree with him.Too much weight has been given to John McNesby, the FOP chairman and a disgusting slob of a human being, not just because of his appearance, but for his Neanderthal views on the criminal justice system. McNesby claims that Krasner was never pro-law enforcement. A district attorney doesn't have to be pro-law enforcement, especially if he doesn't agree with the corrupt and racist practices of that department.The former supervisor of the D. A. Juvenile Division was shown repeated on camera in direct opposition to the policies of the incoming new District Attorney, yet she seems surprised when she is replaced. Get with the program, lady, or hit the streets. The DA is a political appointment, he has to win an election which means he is going to be held accountable by the people who vote him in. He would be failing to serve the public if he allowed someone like her to sabotage his administration and their mission.It's unbelievable that many people within the law enforcement system in Philadelphia wouldn't even give Krasner's policies a chance, like that bald judge shown in the series, for example. He claims he's been doing his job for thirty years...he says this without even a trace of irony as he presides over a completely failed system.",False
6,10,A documentary masterpiece,steppeck,n/a,15/08/2025,"Filmed during the untruth era of Trump, Philly DA is an important documentation of a failing justice system and its glacial reform. Battling and transforming endemic institutional emotionalism, Larry Krasner and his team are shown to be flawed heroes attempting to apply social science to real world decay.",False
7,10,"Wow, was I misled",tg-90754,n/a,15/08/2025,"First let me start off by stating that I am a born and raised Philadelphian. This documentary just blew my mind, I watched all eight episodes back to back. I was lied to, finally the truth is exposed. Krasner may be tge best thing to happen to Philadelphia since the Cheesesteak. It's a must see!!!!!",False
8,10,Very moving indictment of US 'justice' system,mralowe,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I first started watching, I thought this was a drama. After about 10 minutes, I realised that it was an exceptional real-life documentary about a campaigning new District Attorney and the team of like-minded individuals he builds up around him.Larry Krasner wins election to the post, then sets out to right the many injustices in the US criminal justice system, as it applies to the citizens of Philadelphia.As a citizen of the UK, I hadn't previously realised quite how much power a DA's office has in the US. They can have a real influence over which crimes are prosecuted, sentencing and parole policy, as well as holding other institutions to account - especially where the police are concerned.As the series progresses, we meet some of the outstanding campaigners who join Larry in battle and hear a number of heartbreaking stories and statistics. The number of Phildelphians imprisoned for many years, for trivial incidents (or simply their inability to pay a huge bail bond) is truly shocking. Not surprisingly, this disproportionately affects poor and black citizens.I'd love to see a follow up on what happened next.",False
9,6,I don't know . . .,movieliker1,n/a,15/08/2025,"There is a big move in the United States right now to elect ""progressive"" DA's who want to lessen the number of people in jail and prison. They run on not prosecuting non violent crimes and juvenile suspects. And redirecting funds to rehabilitation and social programs. Unfortunately at the time of this review, crime was up in all or most of the cities with these progressive DA's.I support not imprisoning so many people. Especially for small drug possesion amounts. But I believe the first responsibility of the criminal justice system --- which includes the district attorney's office --- is to keep the law abiding public safe. Not giving second and third chances to career criminals.This series spent most of it's time on not prosecuting certain crimes, releasing people from incarceration, and going after ""bad"" cops. And little to none on prosecuting, convicting and jailing violent criminals.I don't know how long this series is. I just finished episode 8.And I don't know how long this experiment is going to last. I just wonder how many law abiding people are going to suffer being criminally victimized, before this progressive DA movement either turns things around. Or people decide it's not working.",False
10,1,Disgusting,kaijuguy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Unlike the other people reviewing this nonsensical puff piece about Krasner, I actually live in the hell hole of Philadelphia and completely understand what he's done here. Let me be perfectly clear, the man is absolutely hated in this city. We set a record for homicides last year and are on pace to break it this year already. This has nothing to do with Donald Trump and everything to do with Krasner and his ""progressive"" policies. Don't waste your time with this show, just look at the stats.",False

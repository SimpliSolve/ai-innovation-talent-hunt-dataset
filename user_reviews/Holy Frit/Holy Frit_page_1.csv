1,9,Fabulous fused glass and a great story!,sunneerakowitz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, I do create some fused glass, but I didn't expect the wonderful story telling that I got from this movie. I wanted the technical information and guidance, but I got much more than I expected. The people are real and the filmmakers let us experience their humanity, see them when they were creating, as they suffered frustration, and finally, as they succeeded. The window is amazing and if I get anywhere near Kansas City I intend to see it in person. I have watched this film twice and loved every minute",False
2,10,Riveting and inspiring,gallerydsf,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this film more than I expected - and I expected to love it. I am a fused glass artist and work with all things Bullseye, so I knew I would be interested and entertained.
But I did not expect all that came in addition to that. You get to know and care about the people and don't want to miss a word.
Bravo - this should be featured on all the streaming platforms.",False
3,10,Thank God this documentary was made! It's legendary!,upjewelrydesigns,n/a,16/08/2025,"ðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ what am amazing documentary! It was a rollercoaster ride of energy, delight, learning, beauty, disappointment, anger, and moving on! I highly recommend streaming it! ðŸ”¥A good lesson in trusting your gut and believing you are capable of anything you set your heart to!I have waited patiently for years for it to become available via streaming. I missed every showing online and in person, so when I received an email that it could be streamed on Prime I jumped on the chance.I was involved with stained glass for about 15 years, and now that I have a small jewelry kiln I have been trying my hand at fusing. I hope I can take one of Tim's classes in the future!",False
4,10,Inspiring,mvolin,n/a,16/08/2025,Loved the film. I would watch again. I would love to see it on a streaming service. As a glass artist it was inspiring to see what can really be done by stretching the boundaries of the material. Well done. If I am ever in Kansas City I think it would be incredible to see the window in person. At the Q&A Tim Carey estimated the glass used in creating the window to be around 5 tons. That is beyond comprehension. I thought the film maker captured the essence of the people involved in taking on this monstrous project. I would love to see more and more from this duo. I hope they go on to produce more films.,False
5,10,Must See Movie!,tmlavie,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a movie I would see over and over again. What a great story and remarkable feat.The making of this massive window from concept to completion is really worth the watch. The money spent to make the window is jaw-dropping.Tim Carey and Narcissus Quagliata are amazingly talented artists. Bullseye Glass and Judson Studio working together despite great challenges to the glass company in the middle of the project; fabulous collaboration.There are some cuss words, including some f-bombs.Many figures from history are included in the window as well as a stunning depiction of biblical figures!I highly recommend this one!! I'd see it again and again!",False
6,10,Best Documentary Ever!,celtcrafts-78427,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a fused glass artist and I first watched this show on line during Covid. I was blown away by the people and the project. I was so impressed with Narcissus' style and method that I've been taking classes from him on line for the past 2 1/2 years. There is some language in the documentary but it is so good; suspense, frustration, amazing artistry, it's all there. I watched the documentary for a second time last April at a glass convention, in a room filled with glass artists. It was fun to witness the reactions of people who work with glass watch this show. I recommend this show to anyone, especially if they have an interest in glass.",False

1,8,Rosebud blooms,Booya70,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well well well, I decided to invest in a comedy special which I never do, and damn't this was a good one. Short n sweet.Great stage presence, fantastic material, and I genuinely wanted to keep hearing more. As well, there was absolutely a bunch of lol moments.On this journey, I didn't hit pause, and almost can't wait for another round from Rosebud. This was indeed the motherlode, and I am ok with decaying on my couch, as long as she continues to deliver this type of fantastic standup. Kudos to in you Rosebud.You are an absolute gem. I would 100% watch this stand up again, and would hands down love to see Rosebud live.This was a fun ride.",False
2,7,Very good with weird edit,seraichyk,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFunny and engaging. There are two performances (she's wearing two different outfits).. and the two performances are edited together. It's a bit distracting and sloppy. Otherwise the material is very funny. Also looks like she's pregnant for parts of the material and post pregnancy for other parts..
Kinda weird.Feels like she's just a really funny insightful friend sharing experiences. A lot of adult subject matter, not for anyone sensitive to a lot of overt sexual stuff.Minimum required characters.. minimum required characters. Minimum required characters. Minimum required characters. Minimum ....",True
3,7,She's Pregnant amd NOT every 5 minutes,michaeldkranz,n/a,16/08/2025,"First time I've heard of Rosebud Baker, and the 30 second preview sounded good. Made my wife laugh so OK let's give it a go.So watching the show it is very distractingly and obviously two completely different performances of the same material at the same venue, recorded many months apart, one where she is very pregnant and one where she is clearly post-partem.This is edited where it flips from one performance heavily pregnant to the post-partem mid-sentence, with no explanation. Having done professional editing for live events in my past, this is a terrible Frankenstein-stitching-together of two obviously different shows, they should be ashamed and just surrender their AVID keyboard and license.She had some good bits and laughs but the unexplained editing takes you out of the show.",False
4,4,VIEWS ON FILM review of Rosebud Baker: The Mother Lode,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really can't stand it when a comedy special shows up on Netflix and it's a comedian I've never heard of, acting ostentatious, mugging to the audience, and feeling the need to wait for someone to laugh at him or her. At 54 minutes, Rosebud Baker: The Mother Lode is that comedy special, a rather generically-filmed snippet where a sort of forced laugh track has seamlessly been inserted (I could be wrong but it sure felt that way).So yeah, I'm not saying Rosebud is dead in the water because she does have attributes, just not in the realm of being humorous. I mean she's attractive, she's got screen presence, she has a nice raspy voice, she managed to pick the right Rodney Dangerfield milieu, and the girl can hurl the F-word like nobody's business. It's just that I didn't giggle at all during ""Mother Lode"", probably because I was comparing Baker to another potty-mouthed chick, that being Ohio's favorite farceur and blonde hot mess, Nikki Glaser. Um, at least Nikki makes you laugh nervously while being offended by her whole affronting, kit and caboodle. Believe that.Cincinnati-born funny-women and profanity-laden stand-ups aside, Rosebud Baker: The Mother Lode was filmed in New York City and edited to the point where some parts show Rosebud 8 months pregnant and other parts show she's just recovering from having a little tyke. Yeah, it wasn't really groundbreaking even though it felt like my eyes were playing tricks on me. Whether Baker is waxing on life as a Republican, dealing with her hubby (who's also a tummler), rambling about the downside of relations, being the poor man's Glaser, or recalling having ye olde bun in the oven, ""Mother Lode"" is just non-zany noise and not worthy of being set free to the masses. ""Comstock lode"".",True

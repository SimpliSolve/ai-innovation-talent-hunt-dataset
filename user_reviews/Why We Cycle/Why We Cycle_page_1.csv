1,10,A very good film about the Dutch cycling success!,ejgrieg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having been several times in the Netherlands and cycling, it is good to have more in-depth knowledge about cycling in the Netherlands.Definitely a feel good film from the Netherlands and a great inspiration to other countries in the world that are plagued with noise, pollution, land use and more from heavy car traffic!And as a comment to the other review, to say that cycling in Amsterdam and Rotterdam is a blast is a huge exaggeration.Cycling is an important part of the Netherlands' DnA and an important part of the culture, this comes across nicely in the film!The Netherlands is a wonderful country to cycle in!",False
2,2,A romanticized documentary about why Dutch people cycle,imdb-54267,n/a,16/08/2025,"A romanticized documentary about why Dutch people cycle. It's so PC (polically correct) it gave me a headache.Maybe there are villages where it's heaven to cycle, but in cities (like Amsterdam or Rotterdam) it's hell. This documentary does not even show a glimpse of how bad the situation really is in these cities, how dangerous it is to cycle in these cities.While the documentary is beautifully made, I had to give it a low rating, it's just too far away from reality.",False

1,6,Underwhelming,Calicodreamin,n/a,15/08/2025,"While the story being told is interesting, the documentary feels very lackluster. The older footage is from an already made documentary and while it's a good outcome on the clemency hearing, the story just sort of ends. It would have been nice to see a follow up with Cyntoia. The interviews with the biological gma were unnecessary. The whole doc was underwhelming, no info you couldn't get from googling.",False
2,6,Murder to Mercy- not the best,badgalfronci,n/a,15/08/2025,This documentary could have been better. Mostly just a bunch of old footage. This doc has quite a few missing pieces. This isn't the quality documentary that Netflix usually brings us. Cynthia's story deserved a much better presentation.,False
3,7,Some of these other reviews...,dfloro,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's not the best documentary, I'll admit, but it's adequate to tell Cyntoia's story. Anyway, re: other reviewers' comments: doc subjects should not, and most often are not, ""compensated"" for appearing or cooperating. And the ""rule of law"" DOES allow for states' governors to commute sentences in the (long-term) interest of justice, which does not infer innocence, nor that the original charge/trial/verdict or sentence itself was unfair or unjust. Anybody who thinks that Cyntoia's 15 years in prison represents her ""getting away"" with the crime needs their head examined. The title says it accurately: A person who had committed a murder ultimately was granted a bit of mercy.",True
4,7,Fairly interesting documentary,bgar-80932,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary follows the case of Cyntonia Brown, a 16 year old who murdered a 43 year old man. She had a pretty tough childhood and was basically a child prostitute who decided to murder a man. It was pretty clear that she did it in cold blood to rob him so that defense failed but eventually she was let out after 15 years. I think this is one of those cases where they got it right even though by the law they really kind of got it wrong. She was 16 years old and the guy clearly picked her up as a prostitute. That's child prostitution and you can't really feel for a guy who would stoop to that. It clearly wasn't in self defense but I think in some cases murder is warranted and the woman clearly tried to better herself and I think deserves a second chance at life.",True
5,6,Nature Vs Nurture,ebabsy-60853,n/a,15/08/2025,"There isn't much that I can write that others haven't touched on. A young woman kills a man, not enough is made of looking at who or what the victim was, but then again a life was taken, and if you don't want it to look like you killed him just to rob him, don't take his stuff. It's hard to fully paint a victim, but then again nobody does. Her defense lawyers never once shy away from holding their hands up and saying ""Yes, she murdered him."" Neither does she. But there are interesting aspects. Should a 16 year old really be tried as an adult? Is the sentence too harsh? Does the fact she is a victim of foetal alcohol poisoning really a defense?On the last question, the documentary actually gives an interesting insight; nature vs nurture. Other reviews state she had a crap childhood. Actually, not really. She was adopted out of a bad childhood early by a loving, church going, caring mother who sent her to school like any other child. However, Cyntoia was not interested in education, choosing drink, drugs, partying, and sex with a much older boyfriend, running away briefly at 12 after being kicked out of school and scared what her mother would say. She went back to school but dropped out again, later confessing she thought she knew it all. These were all traits of her biological mother; drink, drugs, parties. A woman she appeared to have no contact or influence from prior to trial.If you take nothing else from this, take the study of nature vs nurture as your foundation going into the documentary. It does make it more interesting.",False
6,6,At least the law was changed,sahara-88964,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAlthough I'm glad she's doing something good with her life now, this documentary doesn't make me believe she got a bad deal to begin with.
So, lies apparently run in the family, making me less likely to believe her version of events (& I really wanted to). Her biological mother claimed that her mother killed herself. I think she said she blew her chest away with a shotgun. Later in the doc, however, this NOT DEAD woman is interviewed. How did the editors miss this?
The lawyers argued that, because she has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, she's mildly retarded and deserves clemency. When that didn't work, they later argue that, because of her 4.0 GPA in college, she should get clemency. So, which is it?
None of the information presented in the documentary disputed the most damning evidence of all, the coroner's report. That report showed that the victim was most likely sleeping when he was shot in the back. Also, there was no gun for him to be reaching for, as her defense claimed. It's good that she didn't get another trial because it would've ended with another guilty verdict.",True
7,7,The Full Spectrum,Astaroth22,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary, while obviously attempting to be sympathetic to Cyntoia, shows the wide range of complexities involved here. Initially, we see a 16 year old girl who rebels because she wants to smoke pot and ran away from home.Cyntoia's foster mother is probably one of the best human beings on the planet. Hell, I wish she had adopted me! Still though, after running away Cyntoia was undeniably taken advantage of and abused. However, this idea she didn't know ""right from wrong"" is disproven by the documentary itself.Next is the alleged ""victim."" We have a 43 year old man picking up a child for sex. Needless to say, by most standards, he earned the street justice he received. But, for me anyway, we can see that kids are deemed juveniles for a reason. Clearly she should have always been treated by the Justice system in that way.Kudos to former Republican Governor Bill Haslam for making the right decision here. There can be no doubt she has matured, made the most of her bad situation while incarcerated to better herself, and is now in a position to completely turn her life around. Leaving Cyntoia in prison to collect dust while she's already served a considerable amount of time would have made little sense.",True
8,7,7,Edvis-1997,n/a,15/08/2025,"The story and how it was told in interesting way was good, so the movie(doc.) wasn't boring. It was easy to fallow the plot, everything was good with the movie but if you think this film is based on girl who killed a person and now she's a victim. If we would believe in her words, yeah, she tried to self-defence herself but the facts are that she killed a man and that's all we know. Did he tried to hurt her? We don't know that, film didn't tell us anything about killed person. Did he had mental problems? Is this first time he've tried to ""buy prostitute""? What neigbours think about killed person? What do they know about his life? It was lack of information from murder guy perspective. Maybe he was only trying to help poor girl he saw in street and suddenly he gets cold murdered. I've watched this movie but I'm still lost, I'm still not sure is she manslaughter or just a poor girl who had terrible childhood and tried to defence herself. Saw much better documentaries but it wasn't the worst also.",False
9,6,INTERESTING......,sunildaswaney-63642,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very interesting documentary on how the complete lack of parental guidance, love and support could ruin a child's live so very very badly, almost beyond repair!",False
10,4,Medicore documentary that relys on emotions rather than substance,mikhailandrade,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary is initially interesting for about 15-20 minutes. However, it leaves too many questions and relies on the emotional heartstrings of the viewer. For example, what was the prosecutors side for the killing, robbery, and initial arrest? Why were any of the prosecutors counter arguments left out? A quick Google search shows that there was a lot more evidence (notes in jail, attacking medical staff, etc.) to be considered that was not even mentioned in the documentary.I deeply sympathize with the case and believe that justice finally prevailed, but the documentary itself missed the mark for telling the a balanced story.",False
11,10,It's Good Because it Matters,Ditzy-Gypsy,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm appalled at the lack of intellect and compassion in some of these reviews. The key to this woman's story is that she would be considered a sex-trafficked CHILD abused by predators now (now that we are more enlightened) if she was going through this in 2019 instead of 2004. So not only did she make something of herself intellectually while incarcerated (and in spite of suffering from FAS), but she also grew emotionally, spiritually, and socially. THAT is why mercy is required for this case. She was a child. The ignorance on this review page is astounding. And the ""it wasn't exciting enough"" comments make me wonder why anyone expecting an action movie out of a documentary would then choose to watch a documentary instead of an action movie,",False
12,7,The right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment,mudokins4,n/a,15/08/2025,"The premise that firearms play a vital role in our society is silenced by those who are on the never ending quest to enforce stricter gun control measures. They shy away from the fact that firearms are tools that can be used for sustainability and as in many cases to save lives. What about when you use it to make bad things..?
This documentary show is a must watch.",False
13,4,Too manipulative,MovieCriticOnline,n/a,15/08/2025,"I never understand the ""they had a bad life"" defense. Anyone who gets involved with prostitution, hard drugs, pimps, crime, and murder obviously had a bad life. Most criminals have had bad lives. Should that be a defense of their crimes? Absolutely not. If we are blaming their life of abuse then hardly anyone should ever be prosecuted.Now, the actual sentence can be discussed if it is too harsh. In this case, I think it was. 20-30 years would be more appropriate, maybe less.It was interesting. I just wish it was less the emotional stories from her and her family. You just don't judge a case on how screwed up your life was. Obviously, if you are getting beaten and then you kill the perpetrator, that is a legit defense.Was it about the murder or was it about abuse? It felt more like the latter. There is next to no testimonials from the victim's family (literally like 10 seconds) so it is very one-sided. So since we never heard from the victim's family or rarely from the defense it's very difficult to really make a decision as to the time she deserved.I still recommend it, but just be aware of the emotional appeal of the filmmaker trying to dictate how you should feel about it. I would have rated higher if it wasn't so manipulative.",False
14,5,"Flaccid, Biased, Yet Ultimately Revealing",jsteiger,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a story about Cyntoia Brown, who was, quite rightly, found guilty of first degree murder of Johnny Allen in 2004. From the beginning, the fact that Brown was young, small, and had a sad expression led many in the left wing Nashville media, especially the Nashville Scene, to ""blame the victim"" and argue for Brown's release. The facts of the case (as presented at trial, but largely suppressed in this movie) clearly established that Brown viciously murdered Allen as he slept, and calmly returned to the scene of the crime a day later to steal items from Allen's home as his body lay decomposing in his bed. She bragged about her score to associates, and then threatened to kill one of them if he didn't keep quiet. The jury in Brown's initial trial wasn't impressed by bleeding heart arguments to the effect that Brown only shot Allen because she suddenly felt afraid of him. Allen was fast asleep at the time of the murder. And if Brown was so terrified, why did she return to the scene of the crime? This documentary presents only a small fraction of the evidence against Cyntoia Brown, while presenting a glossy, oversold story of her rehabilitation and redemption. Much is made of the college degrees Brown earned, yet very little attention is made of Allen's life story. Brown's relatives barely mention him, as if he was of no more value than a bug to be swatted. The lawyers defending Brown made up a new defense of ""fetal alcohol syndrome,"" and appeared to be sincerely interested in her case. Will they gain her freedom?
Watch the show and see. Just remember, when the verdict is rendered, nobody will be able to ask Mr. Allen his opinion. Cyntoia Brown was his judge, jury, and --- as she actually herself said in a prison phone call to her adoptive mother --- his ""executioner."" Then make up your own mind whether this documentary was fair and balanced, or biased and manipulative.",True
15,8,Interesting Murder Documentary,fleck05IMDB,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm listing the initial set up for the documentary as seen in the documentary previews, not the middle or end.Cyntoia Brown was adopted as a young child from a bio mother that was a drug-addicted 16 year old. When Cyntoia was 16 years old herself, she ran away from her adopted home and would hang out with a drug dealer and pimp named Kut-Throat. Cyntoia says most of the time they were doing drugs or having sex when he didn't have her working as a prostitute.One evening Cyntoia meets a man named Johnny Allen in the parking lot of a Sonic. After small talk Allen asked Cyntoia if she was hungry and if she was up for any action? They went to his house and had sex.At some point after sex, Cyntoia shot Allen in the head with a gun she kept in her purse. She claimed the shooting was self defense - that she believed he was reaching for a gun under the bed. The prosecution claimed she shot him while he was sleeping so she could rob him.After shooting Allen, Cyntoia took $172 , two of his guns and his truck.The documentary follows what happened to Cyntoia after Tennessee charged her with Allen's 2004 murder. She was labeled a prostitute (today she would be seen as a childhood victim of sex trafficking), and charged as an adult for the crime instead of a minor.Based on the evidence it's pretty clear Allen was sleeping when he was shot by Cyntoia, which would usually give me sympathy for him. But Allen was a Real Estate agent and a Youth Pastor - a move many pedophiles make to get the trust of the community and access to kids. (That was not part of the documentary.) Allen calling himself a Youth Pastor, while sleeping with a 16 year old girl, suggests he was a pedophile and sex predator (again, my speculation, not part of the documentary).The documentary POV is one of sympathy for Cyntoia, skipping over other violent acts she committed as a teen. Her case became well known after many celebrities started sharing it on social media.The documentary mainly focuses on Cyntoia's effort to rehabilitate herself and her attempt to get clemency from the Republican Tennessee Governor. Overall an interesting watch.",False

17,1,"A one-sided show, not a real documentary.",courtjes,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLots of troubled youth in dysfunctional families do not commit murer. Here there was a fair trial, a jury verdict and appeals. This ""documentary"" is a one-sided defense oriented story of a Governor who doesn't respect the rule of law.
If it had been more fair in the presentation, it would have made more impact and compassion toward her. Sher murdered a man, took his wallet and truck and thanks to a couple of ""celebrities"" a Gov disregards the rule of law.

18,8,16 yo runaway shoots pedophile dead. That's ok.,Skorpyos,n/a,15/08/2025,"So much pomp and circumstance on a case that's so clear-cut really. A 16 yo sexually abused girl shoots a 40-something yo pedophile dead after he fondled her in his house.She should be celebrated for getting this world off a disgusting pedophile who of course fit the typical pedo description: Xtian and ""concerned with the community"". The fact that she got any jail for this is a disgrace to our judicial system.Glad Cyntoia got clemency and was able to turn her life around.",False
19,5,Murder t To Clemency,annette-pulliam,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerDocumentary is one sided and going for sympathy. She committed murder but should not have been tried as a adult. She deserved clemency. I hope she stays out of trouble.,True

Johnny was a predator, he did not deserve to die but Cyntoia was a damaged young girl who was being pumped out by a 24 year old boyfriend.As a global society we should understand correctional facilities exist to correct and make former offers ready to be welcomed back into society.
Cyntoia served 15 years, she was remorseful and had worked towards being a better person before she was released back into society.

This doc does not do that; it tells again what we already know (which would be great for those who knew nothing about the circumstances). But this doc still only scratches the surface, and Cyntoia (along with other young women still in her similiar past circumstances before/after jail) deserves better.

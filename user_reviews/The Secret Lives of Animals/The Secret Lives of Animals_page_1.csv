1,9,Masterful in every respect,RubberCanoe,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have never even written a review about an animal documentary but this is beyond believable and truly masterful. You expect the beauty of locations around the world and seeing animals you otherwise would know nothing about, but this is beyond anything I have ever seen. First, there is no real animal violence in this but all about the magic of particular animals. Second, most of the animals featured are ones I have never seen before and not familiar with, but not selected randomly. They are magical in their intelligence and sci-fi like abilities. Things they can go with their bodies that are incredible. Finally, the advancement of filming is apparent in what it captures, some animals no bigger than a pea. Each episode ends with a short trailer about the film crew in each episode and their process of capturing the magic. Mind blowing beautiful, magical and masterful.",False
2,10,Who knew,aprillele,n/a,15/08/2025,"The most ingenuous displays of animal craftsmanship. I've never seen anything like it. Animal documentaries are by far my favorite. Blue planet was previously my favorite... But now I have a new favorite. I'm only on episode four but my mind has been blown many times over. And terrified. I was trying to bookmark the highlights in my memory but there are too many! I highly recommend this docu-series. Everyone must see it, especially children. Your admiration and love for all types of animals will by built up. Well, sometimes more admiration than love. I may have nightmares of artisan crafter spiders ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜±",False
3,10,Compelling Docu-Series Observing Nature's Most Interesting Critters,rannynm,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Secret Lives of Animals is a compelling docu-series that observes nature's most interesting creatures. It takes a deep dive into the most astonishing mannerisms of animals, complete with powerful narration, a sensational soundtrack, and wildlife cinematography of the highest quality.The 10-part docu-series follows 77 different animals in 24 countries with nature's rarest qualities, allowing viewers a close-up look at their interactions and their natural habitats. It is chronologically ordered to follow the stages of life, beginning with ""Leaving Home"" and ending with ""Growing Old."" At the end of every episode is a special feature, including behind-the-scenes footage of the wildlife photographers in action. The Secret Lives of Animals is narrated by SAG award winner Hugh Bonneville, who viewers may recognize from his roles in Paddington and Downton Abbey, and run by showrunner Matt Brandon (Planet Earth III).The cinematography of The Secret Lives of Animals is mind-blowing. Produced for Apple TV+ by BBC Studios Natural History Unit, it features bold shots of raging rivers, and contrasting, calmer ones capturing the very moment a raindrop falls from a leaf. The behind-the-scenes features show us just how careful the photographers have to be to avoid startling the animals while filming, in order to capture the most authentic footage possible. There is also a significant amount of risk-taking that certain shots demand - for example, the photographers during the ""Leaving Home"" stage had to approach Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall on the planet, while standing in a boat. While they were required to get dangerously close to the edge, the risk definitely paid off, because what they captured is truly stunning. The angles are varied, and the ways in which the cameras move, such as when they follow the animals on a chase or shoot upwards from a burrow, help build the drama in moments of peak excitement. Instrumentals alternate between peaceful melodies and strong bursts of music, and are combined with incredibly moving narration that works with the viewer's increasing excitement to create a true masterpiece. I found myself honestly appreciating the treasures nature hides in a way I never have before.The Secret Lives of Animals highlights the intelligence of multiple different species, while illustrating that they are not as different from us, or each other, as we think. For example, the predator-prey cycle shows our collective goal to survive and avoid danger, and featured animals are also observed making friends and raising families, much as humans do. No matter what extravagant or distinguishing qualities they may have (such as fish that can fly!), all animals are united by the desire to survive.I give The Secret Lives of Animals 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. The series comes to Apple TV+ on December 18, 2024. By Ruhi K., KIDS FIRST!",False
4,10,"Stunning, Monumental Achievement",phghgfhm,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAbsolutely stunning, maybe even revolutionary cinematography of some of nature's most amazing animals. Rather than focusing on gore, this docuseries focuses on the almost magical abilities of various creatures to face the challenges of their lives: lack of food, predators, keeping family safe, etc. A lizard walks on water, a fish flies, out of forest litter a spider builds a decoy spider 10 times it size -- plus elephants and leopards and monkeys and more! You will, I hope, watch and be inspired by the tremendous courage and cleverness with which these animals face their lives. This documentary series is a monumental achievement. Appropriate dramatic narration by Hugh Bonneville.",True
5,10,Goosebumps,Kutchkin,n/a,15/08/2025,"I just have to say - this docuseries is absolutely mind-blowing. By the time I hit episode 3, I was sitting there with actual goosebumps. That spider scene? Insane. I literally shouted ""Oh my god!"" out loud. Nature is just on another level.What I love most is how it makes you realise how insanely smart and capable animals are. They're out here doing the most incredible things - building, surviving, communicating - all without our tech or tools. It honestly makes me feel kind of useless in comparison. Every episode leaves me more in awe of how much we still don't know and how much more there is to discover.Also, I'm obsessed with the behind-the-scenes bits at the end of each episode. Seeing the amount of work, patience, and passion the crew puts in - sometimes waiting days just for a few seconds of footage - is so inspiring. You can really feel how much they care.This series is just beautiful. It reminds you how amazing animals are and how lucky we are to share the planet with them. If you love nature even a little bit, this is an absolute must-watch.",False
6,10,Unbelievable!,janbuchen,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have to admit, initially I started watching with low expectations - just another ""animal"" show but I was proven wrong! This was absolutely amazing! The videography was simply unbelievable - I just could not get over the moments that were captured! I was fascinated where at the end of one episode the audience was let in and shown the intricate ways the cameras were set up, and the patience it took! I highly recommend this to everyone - I guarantee you will wish there was no end to this series. I congratulate the team who put this together and wish they would be considered for an Oscar for Best Documentary.",False
7,n/a,Enhanced clips & copied script from Sir David's BBC Earth series,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Here Apple TV is being Disney, simply enhancing old yet groundbreaking BBC Earth series clips with new narrator. Script mostly repeats narration wonderfully delivered by Sir David. Series OK for young kids. Hugh gives solid narration, resembling story telling to young children. NOTHING is new.Apple should do another ""Tiny"" or ""Earth @ Night"" series with Tom Hiddleston narrating, both series were original and groundbreaking.SAD Apple with its huge 1 billion $$ TV budget fails to spend funds to further its OWN ORIGINAL groundbreaking series.Def skip it series, unless you've been living in a cave & never seen any BBC Earth docus or free Utube clips with Sir David in past 30 yrs.",False

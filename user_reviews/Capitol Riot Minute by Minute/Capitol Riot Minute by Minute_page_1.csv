1,8,Just a riot?,SteverB,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have only two issues with this film, the first being that to call what happened on January 6, 2021, a simple ""riot"" in the title, undercuts what actually happened. It was a sustained, violent insurrection on the American government in an attempt to overthrow a free and fair election. I would think BY NOW that reasonable people could agree with that. I might have titled this, ""Insurrection at the Capitol: A Timeline,"" which leads to my second issue.The film was simply too short to adequately cover what needed to be shown for a full understanding of the day. ""Minute by Minute"" implies that we will get a detailed view of the event and although I didn't literally expect a minute-by-minute account, this was more of an overview without much detail. The high points were mostly hit, but then a few were glossed over or not mentioned at all. There was no mention of Ashley Babbitt, and the insurrectionists stalking the halls of the Capitol chanting, ""Hang Mike Pence,"" was only mentioned in the narration. I realize 50 minutes is a short film at best, but leaving those portions out was like doing a 9/11 film without mentioning the Pentagon.All in all, I liked this film as it might be something for younger people just learning about American history to view without getting too far into the weeds. It should generate the desire for further research into the topic by viewing other documentaries, reading books, or reviewing what happened in the January 6th Committee investigating this attack on our democracy.

2,8,This is the person someone is chosing to be president?-,jkstep-891-505209,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am sure from the relative value of what occurred the video is a 1. Katrina was a disaster, but it had to be documented. And so as this riot will be a permanent stain on America's history, never to be forgotten. The design, recording, and production of all aspects inside and out are evenly represented. I was shocked to see the wood structure with the ropes in place where Mike Pence was to be hanged just for doing his job. Better yet the recordings of Mr. Trump accepting and proposing the actual hanging as a means of resentment.This was professionally produced detailing every possible aspect that was only 50 minutes in length but watching it pass by like it was just a half hour. Trump should have stopped the event right at the beginning as any professional would have stopped the insurrection before any fatalities. The number of documentaries should direct respectable intelligent Americans toward a sane, safe, and secure solution.I apologize to all of the police/enforcement units for even being forced to endure this in the 21st century. May this never happen again and this representation now has to become a part of educating and stabilizing the new order.",False

1,10,Richard,rickedick,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wonderful story about people who take care about each other and about life. A lot of """"characters if we should call them that, they are not characters it's a documentary, No script just people in whatever they do. It's so good. The best was the young girls in the movie who was very funny but also all other. One persons who had big problems with drugg/alcohol find out of it. (Even if you could not find it out in the story). Best director ever also The movie was full booked at SÃ¶dermalm at 3-4 places the same evening. It's amazing. Andreas the director is amazing and hopefully he soon understand that. A goood movie.",False

1,7,Good Expos√©...But Misses Out on Covering the Bigger Picture,AmorLucis,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary did a good job of exposing a wolf in sheep's clothing, One Taste founder, Nicole Daedone. However, like with many ""cult"" documentaries that are in vogue, it ends with lazy tabloid ""this could happen to anyone"" scaremongering instead of doing the investigative journalism to expose the common threads that left the victims they interviewed more susceptible to falling prey to this type of brainwashing. In this case, the documentary could have explored our dismal sex education for women in particular, our cultural shaming of female sexuality, our epidemic of child sexual abuse in all sexes, and our failure to teach both trauma recovery and critical thinking skills. Some friends and I attended an introductory One Taste lecture describing the ""Om"" meditation in the late 2000's and because I had expert knowledge of my sexual response from a young age from women's health books and had training in critical thinking skills, I immediately recognized the cult tactics of groupthink and gaslighting--and I saw the glazed look in the women's eyes who were devotees. It was truly creepy.Documentaries on cults should examine how our culture at large grooms people to be vulnerable. But every time we try to have that conversation, it's seen as ""victim blaming"" rather than what it really is...empowering to avoid victimization. Documentaries like this have a responsibility to look at the bigger picture, instead of just creating more fear about how any of us could be next which, in my experience, is not true.",False
2,5,"Not exactly taggable under 'thrilling', it's more of an insider perspective! [+54%]",arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ah, this is yet another addition to the list of documentaries that highlight the ugly side of consumerist America and a cult that tries to capitalize on something that easily sells - SEX. The interviews focus on people who worked for and with Nicole Daedone, the founder and cult-like leader of OneTaste, a company that wanted to improve sexual wellness (especially, for women). The piece swerves between the fantastic yet dangerously coercive nature of Daedone and folks who've had to undergo multiple levels of bodily and psychological trauma as a result of being part of her ""closely knit"" team. The upper management apparently was in full favor of letting your inner beast loose in the act of sex, which enabled and condoned predatorial behavior.What begins as a gleefully progressive way of giving women better orgasms, slowly evolves into something exploitative and traumatic. It comes as no surprise, as listening to Daedone speaking about rape and child molestation for a couple of minutes is sufficient for you to go WTF! To think such a company made millions of dollars over the years of its existence is a typical ""American"" thing to believe. OneTaste seems like another company that's targeting people's weaknesses, making you feel bad for everything you've been through in life (sexually or otherwise), and then asking you to pay big amounts on courses that are supposed to make everything better.It's quite similar to a ponzi scheme; the difference being that you're exposing your mind, body, and financial status to possible harm. While much of the documentary revolves around the (mal)practices within the company and several interview snippets of Daedone's, the most impactful story comes at the end when a former employee speaks out, using her sister as a mouthpiece. Does it shock you that there are currently no ongoing litigations against Daedone or her company? Naah.",False
3,7,"Decent watch, deeply disturbed individual creates a cult",onmyownanddoingfine-84395,n/a,16/08/2025,"As with many Netflix documentaries of late, the biggest flaw with this one is creating it too early. There are no conclusions at the end, no satisfying ending, simply ""this is still ongoing."" At least with The Tinder Swindler, the guy becomes destitute (although not for long before he's at it again) but at least it was something.They do a good job in describing how the woman who created it ended up taking ideas from L Ron Hubbard and other people who created successful cults - I think the biggest difference is she after more than money; she was the epitome of ""blame the victim"" when it came to sex.The line I found the most interesting (paraphrasing): ""I don't know why people always say if women ran the world everything would be great, just look at OneTaste.""",False
4,n/a,The truth is horrific,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is just horrific. Some people are true psychopaths and there should be more strict laws for people taking advantage and manipulating the more sensitive ones or traumatized ppl. And not traumatize them even more.It made me sick to watch it until the end. And i am shocked that this person and others envolved in abuse off all kinds are still free.The documentary started with kind a positive vibes, even though i was expecting that some kind of fraud was involved. But this was some other level of evil. Zero empathy! This is a true horror story of an inhumanity. And she is still among people!?!",True
5,6,Disturbing,danielcereto,n/a,16/08/2025,"I did not know exactly what this documentary was about and after watching it I can barely understand why it was made. There is not a straight accusation to the supposed criminals neither to the people who run the show for several years. So, consequently I am not sure if this documentary want to show the reality or a random version of what really happened there.First, I am not a criminal lawyer but this cult place was easy one of the worst I've ever watched. Easy to see most of the people were there because of their traumas.Second, the ending of this was a joke. Not easy to understand why the actual managers and the last one are not in jail.Anyway, overall an Ok production with no message. Entertaining but difficult to understand and watch.",False
6,7,"not bad, not bad...",ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not bad at all, cosidering the narrow spectrum of attention, namely the female orgasm. That part was interestng, and ive come to senses with that the only thing a licenced medical practitioner or the most elequent phd'd psychiatrists cannot prescribe is the female orgasm, which for many women might feel as a serious health issue. So i see the need, i do understand the urge, but it all became like a cult with greed, control, money and violence that makes people want to produce films like this.''let there be no men involved'' a voice popped into my head while watching, cause men cant think womanwise, you can strive for it but youll never reach that orgasmic ''blown spectrum'' that female can experiuence.So as a grumpy old man, my advice is to explore and fondle, dont be shy of that thing down there, and do it with the lights on because its quite a landscape to explore. ..So if you want something else on your documentary menu, watch how to O. M. from netflix, a pretty good but unevenly substantiated negative look at the phenomenon, the research doesnt tell how many soles that this idea baptized into the real thing. It cant be few...",False
7,4,Could have been great...,CardenAsterford,n/a,16/08/2025,"What happened here? A compelling story about a sex cult that teaches women and men about increasing orgasmic pleasure goes soft when it comes time to deliver. Even from a technical standpoint the film is poorly executed and rife with cliches. I feel for the people who were victims of Onetaste but the majority of the film actually celebrates the cult instead of exposing the predatory nature of the leader Nicole and her close followers. The extremely cliche b-roll shots of people laying in bed ""thinking"" and staring out a window with tears welling up are almost comical at times. With that said, it's interesting enough to learn that something like this existed and thrived with celebrities and the tech elite of Silicon Valley. Give it a watch if you are looking for some cheap entertainment (or to listen to in the background). HOWEVER.... what you won't find here is the savvy documentary style that Netflix has nailed so many times before. Shame.",False
8,6,Sad,broggoethe,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have seen quite a few documentaries on cults and most of them, if not all, involve people that are in search of something, they feel they are an outsider for whatever reasons.They also involve a main character who is usually a predator of some type. I wish they would have had more information on the background of Nicole Daedone to get a better idea of her motivation to take advantage of ""needy"" people.Some of her victims, usually women, are so fragile and needy that they are very easy to lead astray, others take some time. The get lied to and buttered up and told they are loved and it totally messed them up mentally.Another thing they have in common is the leader ,aka head predator, usually gets away with it!I really hope all of these people can recover.",False
9,1,"I miss good documentaries, this was not it for me",unleashedwomanhere,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am confused, the IMDB credits show that there are paid actors in this movie. Why would you hire people to act in a ""documentary""? Meanwhile I watched it and didn't see any scene in the movie labeled as a reenactment or dramatization, which I feel they should be required to divulge so the audience can have a grasp on what's real and what's recreated for effect. It just feels irresponsible to me to hire actors and not name the why, who, when, and what of it all. I'm guessing they did it to make this movie ""sexier"" maybe? It really didn't work for me.And honestly, the movie also felt a bit abrasive, in a manipulative kind of way, like the filmmakers were trying really really hard to scare the audience. I miss documentaries that present facts in a way that lets me discover my own opinion. This felt like a series of dramatic music cues, actors, and a few talking heads. I know ""fear sells"", so I get it, but also, who is making money off this movie?As I was looking up these actors, I read that the other people in the movie, the people who aren't actors, were not contacted about being in it, and I'm assuming they did not get paid. Apparently the videos of these non actors was actually stolen and then used in the movie without their consent. That's kinda messed up.",False
10,7,Satisfaction guaranteed (?),kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - the general idea does not sound bad ... at all. But as with everything (or almost everything I reckon), the more people get involved ... the messier it gets. Again, true for most things ... also while you may like it that way, let's be clear: things that (allegedly) happen here (or are talked about)? Not cool to say the least.Question is, what is real? What actually happened? And what do we want to believe? Not everyone involved will talk and give their perspective - may sound guilty, but you can't talk about things others have done without making yourself vulnerable I reckon.On the other hand, you may think when it comes to orgasm: isn't being vulnerable what it's all about? Well mostly I reckon. Now I would not say that this is meant to be erotic or enticing ... or made to arouse you (not judging if it does - well some of it). But more information would have been useful - more insight ... and more clarity ... not everything is the fault of the makers of this ... just saying what some viewers surely have felt watching this. It would be more enjoyable ... with certain aspects (no pun intended)",False
11,4,One Thumb Sideways,SpiritualGansta,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having done some research on this topic, one of the major misses with this documentary is the fact that it combines the history of Morehouse ""Do-ing"" timeline, experiences and terminology with One Taste and ""OM-ing"".It's a huge miss in my humble opinion because it highlights how the producers did not either A: Understand the concepts or timelines being discussed here and/or B: Did not care to properly portray data collected.The lawsuit by previous students citing breach in data used by the producers, coupled with the misappropriation of facts, produced a heavily biased documentary that clearly lacked journalistic integrity.With such a slanted perspective, what could have been educational and expansive into the realm of such a taboo topics of sexual exploration and spirituality instead felt scandalous, salacious, and overly exaggerated.On the flipside, reading between the lines of dramatized scenes and interviews, there is a theme that many interviewed for this documentary expressed that the principles of this organization appeared to offer more intimacy, more connection, more vulnerability, and hitting on basic needs we have as a society.It was also very interesting to see former students and reporter Ellen Huet speak on the positives available in this realm, whether that was intentional or just my perceived perspective.",False
12,10,Accurate,cestlavie-55207,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was in OneTaste and it absolutely messed me up. People who harassed and violated me were welcomed in the community without even a pause. We were encouraged to always be friends and ""stay connected"". Imagine being told that after someones literally violated you. I heard of it happening often within the community. The leader cares more about money and herself than anything else and publicly condoned this behavior. It took me a lot of therapy to start having healthy relationships after I left. And yet, she still has a strong following. I think this is an important doc for anyone who'd like to be aware of cults, cult leaders and those in the sex positive space in general.",False
13,1,"Feels like a hit job, visually interesting",gettingfilmbuff,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just don't buy it. You have three people who were apparently involved over 15 years ago and one kinda dead eyed woman telling stories mumbling that they ""seemed like the kind of people who would do that."" Plus the Magic School reenactment isn't real (check the credits) and the clips are far too short to really understand the context they're being spoken in. I know somebody who was involved a long time ago and they still only say that it was fun. Intense. But fun. Also weird that it was mostly men trashing her right? Where are all the other women who are shown in the videos having the time of their lives? Could they not get any other interviews? Not a particularly bright group. And then... I just dont know. The therapy journals are a bit too well crafted to be totally believable. I look at all media these days as people trying to make a name for themselves and I can't shake the feeling that something is not quite on the money. Points for beauty on the Magic School shots. Good work. Creative.",False
14,1,From someone who was there for 5 years...This is NOT the story of Onetaste.,tangodenise,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere was so much manipulation and obvious deception, this bore no resemblance to what I experienced, observed and learned in my time there. This is a sensationalized story of a few people, mostly men telling THEIR STORY; their opinions, judgements and projections of Nicole and this organization...presented as if it were THE STORY.There was very little BDSM in the more advanced courses---with A LOT of emphasis on consent, sovereignty and agreements. It was one among many avenues people who had desire to consciously explore could. It was never a major thing at Onetaste, The film showed it like the dungeon was part of it and that abuse was condoned. BDSM was Chris Kosely's BIG thing---not Onetaste's.The way they edited Nicole's words-- taken completely out of context and making it look like something completely different and quite the opposite of her message. That Nicole was condoning and excusing abuse, rape and all other kinds of horrors--that could simply not be further from the truth.I cannot support the way they obtained stolen footage and used women in this way, many of my friends with real life consequences in their families and careers--without their consent.Watching this film and knowing what I know--it reminded me of high school , back when gossip, rumor and name-calling were effectively used to define the perception of ""truth"" or ""the story of what happened"" to garner influence and control, used to incite and justify bullying, demonizing and marginalizing anyone who disagreed or spoke out against the popular decrees and agendas or tried something new-- out of the matrix.I'm not in high school. I consider this pathetic.I cannot give it more that 1 star.Just because someone in the media says something is something, doesn't mean it is so. Opinion in not Fact. Edited out of context words don't represent who someone is or their intentions. Hopefully we've evolved from the days of Witch Hunts and Scarlett Letters... but maybe not.",True
15,4,A MisGuided Documentary,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary about Nicole Daedon and her OneTaste Company is interesting but completely misses the mark on its attempt to portray Daedon as a scammer and con artist. While there is clearly a cultish aspect of the personality and the work of Daedon it is not veiled. She is person that promotes female sexual empowerment and enlightenment through female orgasm. She also charges a lot of money for her programs. So what? The people that joined did so of their free will and were free to leave any time. Furthermore, it seems that the program was transparent in its focus on sexuality as a vehicle for self awareness. People's buyer's remorse or embarrassment over paying upwards of $30,000 doesn't;t make this a story of corruption or fraud. I thought the story is interesting but I felt like the documentarian was trying to manipulate the story.",False
16,5,"It's just traumatic, leaving nothing left for the audience to learn.",TaylorYee94,n/a,16/08/2025,"One conclusion. Nicole Daedone is a villain. 'Orgasm Inc: The Story of OneTaste' only amplifies and retells the same old story. Anecdotes and details of events from victims' perspectives are surely important, but all things end there so soon rather than elaborating on the systematic strategies OneTaste used for luring the members in and locking them in. At the end, even though I feel really horrible to say this, I feel as if victims had their chances to get out. Traumatic stories former members tell scar me deeply, and I really feel for them. Then, there is nothing that this documentary can offer to wash it all, such as a solution or resolution. Those horrible stories are all there are to be left.",False
17,9,"Some Things Well Done, Some Not So Well",FifteenOcelots,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI witnessed much of the history of One Taste, and had many friends heavily involved. Some reactions to the movie:* I'm glad that they spent the first while in the show showing and talking about the good sides of what One Taste did and was, what drew people to it and what value people got from it, and that they let Nicole and One Taste speak for themselves* I am happy the movie introduced Nicole's top lieutenants like Rob and Rachel. It could have gone deeper with them, since it seemed to me that they did actually have a lot to do with how things went in OT (for good and bad). But it also seems right that the movie was as focused as it was on Nicole the twisted, broken, cold-hearted, charismatic genius.* With effort, they probably could have found twenty, thirty, fifty people formerly involved who would have been willing to be filmed spilling negative beans. Leaning so heavily on Chris Kosely, with random unshaved hairs sticking off his head, and the awkward woman who tripped over her words undermined their case, since they are physically unattractive and could just be dismissed as discontented outcasts.* It seemed wrong that they made it sound like rape was central to what was wrong with or a big part of what went on at One Taste, and repeatedly showed the video of the woman struggling to get a guy off of her (which I imagine may have been a filming of real violation scenario, or may have been play-acting for a workshop). I don't think there was much of it there. It did seem to me that people were sometimes rapidly and forcefully pushed beyond their comfort zones, realizing years later that they consented to something that it might have been healthier for them to have said ""no"" to. And I have had physical sexual boundary crossing at OT described to me by women who were involved in the community.But what it seemed to me was the central problem with OT, bigger than any of that, was instead that, so it seemed to me, much of its revenue model was basically based on semi-prostitution, which the movie just relatively briefly touched on. Find hot frisky open-minded relatively young women who are new in town or just went through a break up, love bomb them into involvement with and commitment to the community, help them to feel free alive beautiful and on the side of progress for being extra sexual, and then have them offer access to their sex to lonely affluent men (guys with more money than social skills).* I could easily have gotten wrapped up with OT, as I said many of my friends did (it was disconcerting to see friends in the movie, as well as the many One Taste regulars who I kind of knew), there was much interface of people, activities, and paradigms between OT and my social world. And I did have the intention for years to study OMing with them and admired the capacity for ease with physical and emotional intimacy and closeness that OT regulars seemed to have. But to me there was always something off-putting about the scene that had me keep my distance, and the revelations of the past few years validated that semi-conscious choice that I made.",True
18,10,"Good doc, but needs a lot more context",b4blue,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs someone who has been through different cults in my early 20's and am now in my late 40's, I think this documentary was done very well, but in order to truly understand what was happening, one has to have more knowledge. It's certainly not all black and white, good or evil. This seems to be in every story on cults today. There is some good, that attracts and helps people with their problems of living in a modern society, or problems that humans are facing since the dawn of time. Then there is some bad. But is it really that bad or it just doesn't fit with current narratives and how we see people, what the current mainstream morality is? I think that Nicole is at a very high level of spirituality and with that she is losing the understanding of how it is to function on a lower level. But also, no guru is ever perfect. I can't remember which guru said that occasionally they don't feel jealousy. I can see how Nicole built her armour to thrive in life, with all the horrible baggage of her childhood trauma and everything that happened afterwards, but I also see how this made her a less empathetic person. She was enforcing a therapy that worked on her, on others. It can't possibly work like that. No medicine is perfect for everyone. She was also manipulative, in order to expand her empire. To further understand some of the practices, people should study the cults of left hand tantra. Stories there are even more bizarre. Especially if this is not something you need in life.",True
19,9,Excellent documentary which left me with mixed feelings about its good and bad sides,ronaldsonphil,n/a,16/08/2025,The documentary was really captivating perhaps because of the subject matter but also how quickly the concept got validation from people globally who were happy to pay thousands of dollars to take courses or join up for a year. While I was very concerned about the latter story related to violence which was not acceptable it's interesting that thousands joined so hopefully the few isolated incidents were uncommon and not supported by OneTaste. As a non American it seems the FBI only get involved in cults if someone mentions any sexual activity. There is one huge cult who never seem to be targeted perhaps because of their celebrity membership? It's a fine line when we pass judgment on consenting adult activity just because it's not the norm. Maybe Nicole was a con artist playing to peoples most primal urges but I am not sure she's a criminal nor warrants the time and resources of FBI investigation.,False

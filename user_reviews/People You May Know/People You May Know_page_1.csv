1,8,NAIL BITING!!! Everyone needs to watch this.,emmaalbury,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was an incredibly informative documentary and I was gripped the entire time. I knew about aspects of this subject such as data mining being used to target us and how some members of the U.S church are bedfellows with politicians but I had no idea just how far and dark that went. Please watch this as we all need to be informed on what is being done to us and just have dangerous it is. I do wish the documentary itself was better made as the production aspects were quite amateur. But nevertheless, I'm extremely grateful for the film makers to be researching and sharing this information. The is crucial viewing!!!",False
2,9,PLS WATCH!!! VERY USEFUL!,roshinthan,n/a,15/08/2025,So I watched this documentary on apple tv and I have to say it was interesting for me only because this is something that should have been explained in the news more and when I discovered this I have to say I am happy that I watched it. I wish production aspect could have been better since it felt a bit amateurish. But that doesnt matter. But this is an eye opening documentary that explains the things that happened around cambridge analytica so well. And well done to Charles for using a secret cam and actually recording for us the audience to see. I love how he wore a crucifix with a tiny camera inside. And well done to miss gellin who once was my tutor to come a long way! I hope you become big and famous one day so I can tell my friends this was my tutor!!!,False
3,5,"Another meandering, amateurishly assembled ""documentary""",jake_fantom,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis mess of a documentary happens to address a very important topic: the highjacking of Christianity by far right billionaires like the Koch brothers, who employ high-tech data miners to influence the outcome of elections on behalf of radical rightwing candidates, all while the participating religious organizations enjoy 100% tax-free status. Unfortunately, the subject deserved a better investigation than this sloppy, made-on-the-cheap dumpster fire of a documentary provides. The narrative verges on the incoherent as the film crew lurches from location to location, interviewing anyone who would hold still for the camera while a bearded fellow mansplains what we are seeing and hearing. It's worth watching for a few sporadic revelations (though many are provided without concrete evidence), and for a concluding crawl which details the various and sundry contributors and conspirators in one of the most organized radical right religious schemes ever perpetrated upon a democracy.",True

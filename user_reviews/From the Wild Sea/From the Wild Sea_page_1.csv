1,5,Between world class and boredom,FilmFlowCritics,n/a,16/08/2025,"This topic is so worth making a movie about, but in my opinion the movie falls short in many aspects, while it is world class in others!Let's start with what works best... The sound-Design and cinematography choices are simply great in this, you will see what I mean when you watch this, but it really helps you to ""be in the shoes of the animals"" at times, like not many documentaries make you feel usually.So why only 5/10? Well, it starts off with being very educational, but then suddenly stops with that and drifts more into an artistic approach, which I find sad, as this topic needs to raise awareness much more. You will learn something, but the movie misses a massive chance to even teach you more, because it could certainly do that! Unfortunately it jumps fro one ""Plot point"" to the other, without really fully telling ""the story"" in full.This movie has no voiceovers at all and rather tells the ""story"" by literally just listening to what is said in conversations, an interesting choice of style, but unfortunately it just doesnt fulfil its potential, which is such a shame!It was still good to have seen this movie, but maybe it could have benefitted from a few more explanations to teach a very important lesson, that all of us should learn... stop trashing this planet!",False

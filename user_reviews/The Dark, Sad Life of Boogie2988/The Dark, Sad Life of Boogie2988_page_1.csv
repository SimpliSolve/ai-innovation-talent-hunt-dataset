1,7,A really engaging film about a self destructive figure,tommo-merison,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've known about Boogie2988 for many years. I was a fan of his whacky content as a teenager. In later years however, Boogie's (real name Steven) popularity has depleted, along with his money. With constant controversies and restless self destruction, the Mr Rogers of the internet has fully washed up from the wave of backlash.This documentary is a very well made film in many respects. It's not overly long, it explores many aspects of someone's life, is brilliantly edited and doesn't hold back on being real. I honestly didn't expect this doc to be as scathing as it wound up being. I was expecting it to be pity porn. Whilst it may be quite somber in approach, it doesn't appear to be taking Boogie's side when it's unjustified.Boogie hasn't got the best reputation at this point, he's become too difficult to like or route for. He's a classic case of a guy who really can't do what's best for himself. Anyone in his situation should be removing themselves from the internet on indefinite hiatus to figure stuff out. Unfortunately, as the film makes clear, it seems he now needs youtube more than youtube needs him.Despite all the misgivings, I do hope Steven can sort himself out, and view this work as a wake up call to finally move on and really try on his self improvement. Whilst many will be angry, I think he can get better and maybe bounce back a little in the right circumstances. The biggest enemy in his life is clearly himself, and if he can learn legitimate self respect, then the only way to go is up.Any real criticisms of this film will be more targeted on the subject than the overall production value. The artistry of the film itself is really commendable for an independent feature with likely little money behind it. It's an entertaining and revealing piece of work.",False
2,7,Pretty good documentary with one little pet peeves I have,randomaa,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTerrific, I never realized how much of a scumbag Boogie is, really open my eyes to the kind of guy he is. To say he is narcissistic is an understatement.The job interview section of the documentare in particular made me mad unbelievably. From his demeanor and attitude, to him constantly naming bad traits about him to waste both the job interviewer and his time. The part where he talks about woman as well, just really make him look like a misogynistic a-hole.It was really well made and informative overall, however there's this one pet peeves I have. In the girl section where he talks about how he treats and think of woman, there's this one small shot of a girl in her underwear on top of Boogie. I'm sure they gotten her consent to show that but it just doesn't feel right for me.Beside that it's a pretty great watch.",True
3,10,MESSED UP BEYOND BELIEF,ronan_nguyen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really messed up video; but it's really well made. Shows just far how this guy has plummeted. I used to like his Warcraft content, but he's really gone down hill.As for the documentry itself, it's really well made. Production is out there, but it kinda makes me feel weird that it's being wasted on Boogie. This dude is a joke; he's one of the worst youtubers. ""Mr Rogers"" of Youtuve. It's a joke. It's a shame to see some degrade into him, but at the same time, he pretty much does it to himself.He disrespects woman, he has this truly entitled attitude towards his own fans, it's really gross. REALLY.",False

1,6,See this footprint,nogodnomasters,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is perhaps one of the better documentaries out there. It does show some opposing views. It never mentions the man who spent his lifetime promoting a hoax and the most famous faked film out there. It mentions some hair testing, but not the Yeti hair that tested to be some sort of bear. It spends a lot of film time on footprints. China combed their forest to look for their wildman but could not find any evidence. The one person raised a valid point that any primate would be living in a community. I don't now what primates are hermits and lone hunters. The film claims they look like extinct humanoids but never specifically mention one as they all are smaller than humans, not larger. So the story would be some sort of primate lives in hundreds of different locations around the world (Not in tropical rainforests?) all have single sightings and never group sightings. And none have been conclusively discovered even with a shrinking ecosystem. Excuse me if I remain a skeptic. Please leave the Babylonians out of it. It makes you look stupid like ancient alien believer.",True
2,6,"""Sasquatch Among Wildmen"" (2020): Big Foot has some Buddies?",jtncsmistad,n/a,16/08/2025,"Many among us believe that the existence of Sasquatch, or Big Foot, is not only plausible, but real. There are also those of the opinion now that the still mythical creature is just one member of a larger society of what are called ""Wildmen"", ape-like beings surmised to be an offshoot of the evolution of man.The documentary ""Sasquatch Among Wildmen"" introduces a host of videos and photographs alleged to be sightings from around the globe, molds of supposed giant foot prints, hair samples and alarming audio recordings of unidentified animalistic screeching. All of this considered collectively may or may not serve to substantiate the possibility that ""Wildmen"" actually exist.Physical evidence remains the missing component to inspire any manner of wide acceptance by the scientific community.Still, it's all pretty flippin' wild, man.",False
3,9,Absolutely Loved It!,craigahrens,n/a,16/08/2025,"Okay, so first off... I've seen I'm sure probably every ""Sasquatch"" documentary type of film out there. But this one is hands down the best. I loved the knowledgeable researchers featured in this film. They weren't a bunch nutjobs. But rather well educated and experts in this arena. I enjoyed their presentations. I don't want to give away too much here for risk of being considered giving away ""spoiler alerts."" But for me this one is an easy ""Thumbs Up"".",False
4,5,Plenty of Bigfoot stories,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Russian Almasty, the Chinese The Yeren, the Himalaya's The Yeti - these are the many creatures that we refer to as Bigfoot. If you're followed our site for any length of time, you know that we love Bigfoot and movies about it. Just check our Letterboxd list, for example!Darcy Weir - who specializes in journeys into the unknown - has created this look at this creature, bringing along experts like Dr. Jeffrey Meldrum, Derek Randles, Shane Corson, David Ellis and Lee Lustig.Following the success of his explosively popular Bigfoot documentary, The Unwonted Sasquatch, Weir has returned with a follow-up that aims to expand on the history of this creature and its possible Relic Hominid cousins internationally. Don't know what a Relic Hominid is? You better watch this and catch up!If you've got 73 minutes and a burning desire to know more about whether or not these creatures exist, then this would be a pretty good use of your time. It's the closest thing as you can get to hunting down one of these elusive cryptids without getting down in teh dirt and making mating calls yourself.",True
5,9,Delivers again,williamgway,n/a,16/08/2025,Another wonderful piece of filmmaking from the Darcy Weir studio. This time we follow Bigfoot and all its connections around the world.It really opened my eyes to some of the connections I had not previously thought about. Worth a watch for all those interested in all things Sasquatch and very interesting even for those who are not.I highly recommend,False
6,2,Wish this movie was also a hoax...,takvstak,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a boring tedious mess to sit through. You'd think something as fun and silly as a bigfoot would at least translate to a fun documentary from a bunch of people making things up. Sadly, no.Just a bunch of talking heads.There is nothing new here or of importance to the Sasquatch myth.Skip it and go out into the woods. You might not find a Bigfoot, but you'll have a better time staring at trees as they grow.Would probably be rated a 1 as this is a huge nothing burger... But I like burgers.2 stars. Skip it. Into a river.",False
7,9,Sasquatch Gone Global,TheAll-SeeingI,n/a,16/08/2025,"By providing a more global testimonial and supporting it with the no-nonsense science of subject matter experts, ""Sasquatch Among Wildmen"" successfully decouples its legendary subject from its cartoonish Bigfoot shadow that too often follows it only through the woods of America's Pacific Northwest.Sensationalism is left stateside as we meet China's Yeh Ren - the ancient culture's equivalent manifestation of the ""wild man."" Here we're shown comparative footprint castings that seem to indicate a cross-continental continuity among mythologies once presumed disparate. Fresh interviews with acclaimed Sasquatch researchers Dr. Jeff Meldrum and Derek Randles give the film an incisive sense of spine.This is aspirational documentary filmmaking, as ""Sasquatch Among Wildmen"" somehow breathes fresh perspective into a subject too often forced to stand in one place. - (Was this review of use? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!)",False
8,2,disappointing,asherah-34466,n/a,16/08/2025,"I believe in bigfoot I also have spent years looking for elusive hidden creatures who do not want to be seen...Watching what these researcher's do to try and find bigfoot seems amateurish.......many if not all of the bigfoot shows don't even use binocular's.... if they have cameras they don't know how to use them well...and this is key to capturing this creature, the best footage show a creature that can/sit/stand rock still ..if its sitting in thick brush they can easily be walked right past.......the video footage was poor at best...most of the documentary was speculation ...based on maybe or perhaps...understand how to find hidden creatures and send in experts.",False
9,9,I love it!!!,jblockbuster,n/a,16/08/2025,I was able to see this film early - and I absolutely love it! It's captivating and definitely gives you some good insights if you are into that sort of docs. Enjoy,False
10,9,Awesome!,mich1elle,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a great documentary. I've always have been fascinated by sasquatch. If you are anything like me you will love it!,False

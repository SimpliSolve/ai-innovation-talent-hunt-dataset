1,10,A Beautiful Reminder of Why We Love The Rose,chufredis,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Rose documentary honestly hit me right in the heart ðŸ˜­ Watching their journey - the struggles, the growth, and how they've stayed so grounded - just made me love them even more. Come Back to Me isn't just a documentary, it's a reminder of why they mean so much to us. You can feel how sincere and real they are in every scene. Their bond, their honesty, and the way they stay true to themselves made this so powerful. I walked out of it feeling even prouder to be a fan, a Black Rose through and through. ðŸŒ¹ This is the kind of film that stays with you long after the credits roll. Truly unforgettable.",False
2,10,ðŸ–¤ðŸŒ¹,HaileyS2706,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely loved this documentary!! I have been a fan of the rose for a while now and they always know how to make me cry without fail!! Healing is an important process that is everyone goes through a some point, though everyone's process is different. This concept is explored throughout the documentary through the healing of music. As someone who healed thanks to the rose it really hit close to home! Even if you aren't a fan of the rose, this documentary will allow you to see the lovely and genuine feels they bring to the table that set them apart from other bands. I would definitely give this documentary a watch!",False
3,10,Don't give up too soon,IrinaR-32,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love The Rose and their music. So when the news broke that they filmed a documentary that will premiere at TriBeCa, I bent over backwards to travel from Germany to NYC to see it. The aspect I was most interested in was that whole topic of navigating different cultural identities and everything that comes with it, because this is a big part of my life, too. One important message I found in the film is, don't give up too soon - it's worth trying different paths to get where you want to go, it's worth working on your relationships, and sometimes it's even worth just waiting, or having a little patience. I think this message is more important now than ever, because in today's world of constant haste and waste, people seem to forget sometimes that some things just take a certain amount of work (maybe even really hard work) and time, and that if a road is a little bit bumpy, that doesn't mean that you can't travel it. These four guys have been through a lot together, and I think what has helped them was their great friendship and loyalty towards one another, and this bond seems to have grown even stronger over all this time. It's so heartwarming to see how they're apparently enjoying their current tour and each other's company. I really wish for this documentary to become available to a wider audience because there's so much in it that can inspire and encourage especially young people, but actually everybody.",False
4,10,I loved the rose,JessicaC-758,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been following The Rose since 2020 and I loved this documentary. It shows us everything the band had to go through to get to where they are today, and all that effort has been worth it. They are great artists, but they are also people, and they are incredible. We can see it in every video they upload, every song they make, and also thanks to this documentary. They came to me during a very difficult time in my life, and their songs motivated me to keep going. I knew I wasn't alone in the rain, that there would always be someone by my side. I realized that thanks to them, The Rose, and from that moment on, I've been a Black Rose.",False
5,10,A Must See!,KarenBlackRose,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved everything about this documentary. The film really showed The Rose's depth, color, and sincerity as artists and humans pursuing their dreams as musicians in an often brutal and unforgiving industry. The film highlights both their highs and lows as a band and shows just how talented, humble, hardworking and genuine they are. It's a must see for all fans of the band and music lovers in general. As some one who is a part of their fandom known as Black Roses, I'm happy and grateful to be on this musical journey with them. Each one of them makes this band so special. They deserve the world.

Even if you've never heard of them, the documentary is inspirational and entertaining. It showcases lessons in resilience, perseverance, and determination.

24,10,We Go As One,ShellyO-41,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe happy-sad story of Korea's Indie Rock band The Rose is recounted in this very watchable documentary, Come Back To Me, from director Eugene Yi. Come Back To Me brought all the emotions. Laughter, Sadness, Excitement, Fear, Excitement, Surprise and last but not least, Relief. Eugene Yi examines how four friends from South Korea and California, ended up as part of the Korean Indie Rock invasion. The Rose members Kim Woosung, Park Dojoon, Lee Hajoon and Lee Taegyeom, had a humble beginning while being royally manipulated and exploited. They conquered their worst fears and came out the other side. Director Yi showcased each members rawness and accountabilities. There's a lump-in-the-throat moment when Taegyeom opens up about suicidal thoughts. The first thing I did after I finished watching the documentary was to go back to their music and start at the beginning. The words have a new meaning now and I wish this documentary was released before I knew who The Rose were. Going forward, my experience with The Rose will definitely be with a new appreciation!",True

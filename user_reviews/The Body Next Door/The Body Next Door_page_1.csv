1,9,A shocking story.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"The small Welsh community of Beddau is rocked, when the body of a man is found wrapped in multiple layers, left outside a house. Police are keen to speak to the woman who found the body, but enquiries seem to lead nowhere.It's a quite shocking documentary series, one that only gets more and more outrageous with every passing episode, if it wasn't real life, you'd think someone who made up this story had gone too far.The final episode is extraordinary, you'll have your jaw dropped open as to hear exactly what went down.Leigh's story is astonishing, initially she's some sort of fun figure, I likened her to Edina Monsoon from Absolutely Fabulous, but as this progresses, you realise exactly what she is.Fascinating first hand interviews, especially those from New Zealand, talk about survivors.Amazing.9/10.",False
2,10,Wow. Excellent true crime series,cqtiger-51415,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every now and then you find a series by accident that you cannot put down.I was surprised I've never heard of this particular case, especially when a lot of it began in New Zealand. I watched the three episodes one after another it was that riveting. It was great to have actual footage from a ""current affair"" back in New Zealand with the people involved. The children suffered so much with no help from the NZ government. It was very sad.I am usually not a fan of interviews in a documentary series as they are a bit drawn out but this one was very well done. Give the series a go he won't regret it.",False
3,10,Couldn't stop watching,katharinewhite,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary was so gripping, I couldn't stop watching until the three episodes had finished.I originally saw the Welsh producers talking about the New Zealand connection on a breakfast TV programme. It sounded interesting, but the unfolding of the story and the pacing of it was far more extraordinary than I imagined. I live in New Zealand and don't remember ever hearing about this case in the news.What began as random police questions of people after a body was found in a bag outside a block of flats in Beddau in South Wales, turned into scrutiny of one eccentric dead woman occupant's life history and the lies she had told.It's incredible to imagine that parents could even conceive of abandoning their young children and buggering off to another country. And telling them they'd be back in a few days? It was inexplicable cruelty. And yet it happened in good old New Zealand. The torture that followed as these children were passed from foster family to foster family, is hard to comprehend, and yet this only became international news by chance as part of a murder inquiry in another country years later.Just when I thought the story couldn't get worse, the doco stepped it up a notch. It was heartbreaking and yet also enthralling. I really hope the New Zealand children can one day overcome their ordeal. Highly recommended.",True
4,10,My gosh,brechtseepers,n/a,16/08/2025,"Only the thing that I want to say is that I want to hug that son and other children so badly. You can see the stress they're going through and feeling pure pain. I hope they feel well after all of this, how cruel this situation was offcourse.The shaking with his legs, the trauma's. I feel so so bad for them...
Okay back to the story.This show is the if not one of the best documentary series I have ever seen and I've seen hundreds of crime documentary's.I've watch the episodes in a row this night i and couldn't stop. It's almost morning in The Netherlands so I'm going to bed soon but I was focused without pauses all the time to see the full documentary and I did watch all of it.It's so heartbreaking and for the people that are there who've been through a situation like this or struggle with traumas, I wish you all the strength in life and you derserve the world and all the love in my opinion.No one, but seriously no one deserves those things in a human short life. Life isn't always fair and rosy but my heart is with all of you and I wish the family and everyone else out there a life where's peace, love and happinessLovely greetings from me,
Brechtje 26y from The Netherlands is here with you and spreading love for all the people who miss that part. I want to hug all of you, seriously.",False
5,10,STUNNED SURPRISE,sherpro-13339,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started watching this on a wet and windy Sunday afternoon just to pass the time. WOW did I get a shock when I realised that I had been so absorbed that I had seen the whole thing.I don't know why it's categorised as a DOCUMENTARY and assume this is why there is no cast list or reader views etc.I got totally involved and salute the direction, the script, the music and of course the actors.Somewhere the point was made that of course there were no actual people and all personnel were actors.I totally overlooked all of that and believed I was watching the real events being filmed as they happened.Naive? Sure but I am at times a nasty piece of work who sniffed out pretences but nothing was further from my mind in this case.I urge you to watch it: it's on STAN.",False
6,9,Bizarre and Brilliant,Harvey689908,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is by far one of the best, and most bizarre true crime documentaries that I've ever seen, it was absolutely brilliant viewing and just kept giving, getting even more bizarre as it went on, I was glued and it comes highly recommended by me.It all starts when a body, wrapped in 41 layers of plastic, suddenly turns up outside a block of flats in a former mining village in South Wales, and what follows thereafter I couldn't possibly try to explain, you just have to give it a watch, and try to take it all in and process it yourself, truly bizarre!As a side note I will say I felt so sorry for the woman's now grown up children, you could clearly tell they were still very traumatised by her. But great to see they got on with their lives as best as possible and had success in many areas.",False
7,9,Utterly Compelling,wpvzthm,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Body Next Door (Welsh Village with Murderous Secrets)The Body Next Door is a tense, atmospheric documentary that taps into the age-old fear of not truly knowing who your neighbours are. Set in a quaint Welsh village, the show brings the seemingly idyllic community into sharp contrast with the dark secrets simmering beneath its surface.The premise is familiar yet gripping: a small village, where everyone knows each other-at least, they think they do. When a body is discovered, the cozy familiarity starts to crumble. As the investigation unfolds, it becomes clear that beneath the polite facades and picture-perfect homes, lies a web of deceit, betrayal, and possibly murder.What makes The Body Next Door especially compelling is its exploration of how little we sometimes know about those closest to us. The series highlights the paranoia and mistrust that can fester in a close-knit community once doubt takes root. This slow-burn documentary keeps your attention, until the final moments, when all the pieces come together in a chilling conclusion.If you're a fan of true crime documentaries with an edge then this is for you. A deep dive into the human psyche, The Body Next Door is a must-watch. It's eerie, thought-provoking, and a haunting reminder that you never really know what-or who-lurks next door.",False
8,10,Perfect murder mystery,CatBrown41,n/a,16/08/2025,"When truth is stranger than fiction, this series delivers gripping plot twists in every episode. The storyline is extremely engaging, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout. The Welsh police play a pivotal role and do a sterling job, adding authenticity to the narrative. Each episode brings new surprises, making it hard to stop watching. I'd recommend binge-watching because once you start, you'll want to see how it all unfolds. Perfect for those who enjoy suspense and unexpected turns. A must-watch for thriller fans. Highly recommend this and will look for more documentaries by SKY!!!!",False

1,7,"Decent show, with Interestingly Creepy Cases! :O",midnitepantera,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've only seen 1 episode so far. It was listed as Season 1 episode 1 (Under Your Skin) But I can't find that listed here in episodes. So don't know if it was wrongly titled or missed on this page??But it's basically about Dr. Michael Mastromarino, the Body Snatcher Doc and his Wife, Barbara, that had No Idea where their millions came from. VERY CREEPY DUDE!Started out as a life-saving idea, but Greed, as usual takes over and people become Ghouls for MONEY!! And worse endangered ALoT of People! ! Very Disturbing Case. :o.",False

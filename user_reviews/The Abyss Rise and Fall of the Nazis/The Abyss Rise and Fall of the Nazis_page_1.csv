1,8,German documentary of its own history leading up to and thru nazism.,phlbrq58,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ive been watching, reading, listening to accounts of WWII for 15 years. Series from GB, France, Canada, and Russia. World At War is still the best. All have their particular perspective. So this 2021 release from Germany, with voice over interview translations is very well done. It seems that in the last 20 years the myth of the good German soldier has been exposed as wishfully false. Its perspective is from the homefront with mere mentions of the raging battles. Extensive coverage of the holocaust with interviews of citizens who interacted with camps and slave labor.Criticisms are its breaks in timeline that might cause confusion for viewers not intimate with the sequence of events along with episode titles that are misleading. Familiar footage is mixed with some new (to me) images and footage. The historians (Ger, UK, U. S, Ital,Pol, Sov.) are authoritative and somewhat familiar to those steeped in the YT universe of docs and lectures. Found on YT 3/23.",False
2,1,It's a lie. Intentionally misleading is a lie.,SashaI-9,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is a lie. Not telling the complete truth, especially when it's done intentionally to deceive or mislead, is indeed considered lying. This documentary doesn't tell about the union between Hitler and Stalin, the secret agreement Molotov-Ribbentrop to divide Europe. How they divided Poland between them, how USSR annexed Lituania, Latvia, Litva, West Ukraine. Not telling the truth intentionally is a crime of lying.Lying by omission is when you leave out crucial information in an attempt to mislead someone. It's a form of deception that can be difficult to identify because everything you're saying is true. However, it doesn't paint the full picture.According to research by philosopher Don Fallis, it's possible to create false beliefs just by withholding information. Keeping secrets or leaving out parts of the story can result in the same misconception as when you intentionally make false statements.It can be hard to detect when someone is lying by omission. A study published by social psychology researchers Sharon Leal and Aldert Vrij found that those lying by omission often show evidence that they're hiding something apart from the truthful parts they remember.",False

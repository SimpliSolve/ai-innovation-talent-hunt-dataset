1,6,Too personal to reach broader public,alessandro_sp,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGranted, there will be a relatively small group of people who resonate with the storyline. I myself love nature, mountains, am in my mid-fifties, have my loved wife and daughter. I am not as old as the main character but I certainly can relate. But despite beautiful shots which are largely helped by the location and being able to relate to the character's story, the film feels too long. Even when the main character talks about time and the pace at which we get at things, suggesting we don't rush, the film still does feel dragged.It starts as something more generalistic but soon goes into specifics of family history - then it loses part of its appeal. Much like a very personal tribute to her family, which would be best suited to their own and maybe not for general public.Also, the idea of nature as places of outstanding beauty is very shallow. Nature is all around us, sometimes thriving, other times merely coping, but we should learn to see it everywhere, not only in the fjords of Norway or the mountains of the Himalayas.",True
2,10,"A spiritual film, cinematic to depict nature, sentimental to depict humans",jasbour,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this film was a deep experience. The film is shot around the village of the director, Oldedalen Norway, which is situated in a valley of a beautiful fjord surrounded by breathtaking mountains at the edge of the glacier. The film is like walking in nature with a wise man whose family has lived in this valley for many generations, the man sharing generational wisdom throughout the walk.The style of the direction gives the film a character that is ""local"" but also universal. Local because of the specific colours, sounds and scenery, but also universal because it touches upon aspects of nature that we recognize in all kinds of habitats on earth. Similarly, the film is both time-specific but also timeless. Time-specific as it goes through each season of the year, but also timeless as it conveys the message of life continuing from one generation to the next, despite difficulties. Finally, the film is both personal but also collective. Personal because it tells the story of the director's parents (her father is the wise man that walks with you), but also collective because the story you hear touches upon aspects of life that resonate inside all of us.The film cinematography is very original, taking you from drone to underwater views of the scenery, during different seasons of the year. The music score is geniously tailor-made to translate sounds of nature (waterfalls, wind, etc) to music delivered by classical instruments.Have never reviewed a film in IMDB before, but in this case I just felt I had to, after reading an ignorant review by someone else here.",False
3,n/a,"This is not a film, it's a spiritual journey",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched this at TIFF, and I feel almost overwhelmed with the amount of emotion I have in me right no. Truly is a love letter to nature, family and life itself. The music and sound design support the beautiful shots of Norway, I watched so many nature documentaries before but this is some next level content. The slow rhythm of nature reflects beautifuly in the life of the director's parents, who are followed throught the film.Please watch this important, beautiful creation. For all the people who worked on this film- you should feel so proud. This was a moment I would never forget. Thank you for sharing it with the world.",False
4,10,Beautiful depiction with double meanings,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis incredible, unique and ever authentic documentary is definitely deserving of all its hype - it is indeed a very profound, low scale, yet massive achievement.It is a celebration of nature, yet at the same time a celebration of life - all conveyed in a slow, somewhat cozy pacing to exception.It is expertly cut and edited, and the cinematography and imagery can not be overstated in how incredible it is. The film features some truly beautiful images and scenery, very beautifully put together, to say the least.Overall, truly an incredible film and an achievement that puts forth the joys of life and nature splendidly! Highly recommended.",True
5,10,Breathtaking,attilalengyel-78684,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a deeply personal take on nature, family, and life itself. I have never seen anything like this before. I would award it all the Oscars there are, but it is, somehow, far more than that. It's beauty is astonishing and spectacular to a point you can't normally reach. What pictures you see here are beyond comprehension. All that embedded into a family story, so light, so fine, so easily weaved into the film like Buddha levitating above water. Profoundly personal yet, at the same time, impersonal. With a score 11 out of 10, editing 11 out of 10, it is way the best documentary / biography I have ever seen in my life. (I'm 53, so I've seen plenty.) I have no any connection with any of its staff but say: Margreth Olin 20/10. I wish I knew you.",False
6,4,flat through and through,eclarkoffice,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beautiful beautiful country and the just most lovely couple and love story98% of the film is somewhat underwhelming drone footage with sometimes awkward drone movement.. cut scenes of hands and human skin compiled with more drone footage. Lots of meaningless artificial audio piped into nature scenes. The artificial animal walking sounds, glacier cracking effects, Iake ice settling, and so on, very much distracts you from the picture.This should have been 20 minutes long at the very most. This runs far to long without capturing any significant moments of the main characters lives. Who, I will say again, have a beautiful life together.",False
7,5,Self-indulgent and boring view of nature,camsei-52298,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found this film to disappoint me in several ways.I am Norwegian, living abroad and the only thing I miss in my life is to have more nature experiences. I would have expected this film to move me, and make me want to dream about moving to a beautiful place. Instead it made me realize how important it is to be an active part of the civil society and give your best to others.The overly personal and isolated story of this couple, seems navel-gazing and excluding, a bad trait, although the portrait of the main character in the film is sympathetic.The pictures are beautiful, but the story is simple and lacks courage, edge and generosity.Maybe my disappointment of the film has to do with me being gen-y public, whilst the film made by an gen-x instructor and writer romanticizing her silent generation parents, who are fine with being indulging in their secluded and privileged beautiful surroundings that they don't need to share or fight for.",False

1,9,future generations can undoubtedly recall that there was a time when India experienced 'too much democracy.',rajratnabhojane,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am deeply inspired by the courage shown by the makers of this documentary !While many of us may have discussed the farmers' protest, initiated by the farmers of our country, only a few of us have truly delved into the quest for the ultimate truths and their struggles. Somewhere deep in I knew whatever is happening there on the border of delhi is so terrifying, as if these were the borders of India- Pakistan. But , I must admit that the truth is way too distressing. I am confident that this documentary will provide an honest glimpse into that period.I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Director Mr. Varrun Sukhraj and his team for crafting this film and preserving evidence of this chilling era in the world's largest democracy. Now, future generations can undoubtedly recall that there was a time when India experienced 'TOO MUCH DEMOCRACY'.",False

5,n/a,An urgent and must watch,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Do or Die!Jai Jawan! Jai Kisan!Sarfaroshi ki tammanna ab humare Dil mein hai
Dekhna hai zor kitna bazu-e-qatil mein hai!Aur bhadkega ye shola so jo dil mein hai...And yes, the ambers of this criminal atrocity that the State of Indian Union committed on farmers will continue to burn through a very long time. Despite all the efforts by organized media of the country on the command of Government to hide it from mainstream news, the People of India have come out in support of this Farmers Movement, which was in deed much bigger than the just the farmer community. Although, the farmers were at the forefront of receiving the heavy handed Central Government, with just a featherweight support of the Supreme Court of India but primarily their own enterprise backed by the wide ecosystem which reached every strata of supply chain and ultimately to the square meal on every individual's plate in the country, made the Goliath of Indian Union Government which has come into power with popular mandate and arguably the most charismatic and popular Prime Minister the country had seen after Mrs. Indira Gandhi, to concede.This documentary tells the story of modern India's most well organised revolt, out of numerous others which were sadly and violently silenced by the government since it came into power in 2014. But with farmers the government failed miserably in estimating their strength and enterprise.Watch this one to know India's true Strength. It's fertile land which is harnessed by the most tensile individual - An Indian Farmer.Veer bhogya vasundhara! In its true sense.",False

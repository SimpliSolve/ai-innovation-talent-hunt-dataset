1,8,"It's hard to say it's great, but it is.",rikvanagt,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary got me hooked within minutes. Stepping into this family's private life with only original police footage and personal homevideo's gave the most realistic image to start a horrific story. The mystery surrounding it made me feel instantly anxious of the outcome. The tension rises to unbearable levels until the climax hits. I wouldn't recommend this to young parents or anyone who likes to sleep right after watching this, because I won't for some hours... that's for sure.",False
2,8,Heartbreaking,nikolemarovic,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo I was very interested in this case when it first happened. Horribly tragic and sad, but I was curious as to how someone who was portrayed so normal could do this. Especially to his two daughters. According to everyone interviewed he was an attentive and caring father. Also according to Shannan, he was the best thing that had happened to her. Who doesn't want to know what happens to a person to make them ""snap"" like this? That's what the documentary was missing. The psychological stand point was completely emitted. This documentary was put together very well, with home footage and Shannan's personal videos she would post on Facebook, but what happened to Chris Watts to make him do this was an important piece that should have been included.",True
3,8,unsettling in another way,Henry_Seggerman,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very intoxicating detective story. But what makes it really spooky is, if you've seen fiction films like CACHE and DOSSIER 51, this uses real surveillance footage and text message and voicemail evidence as most of the film's content. It's a technological marvel -- but in a scary, Big Brother/Stasi way.",False
4,n/a,Haunting,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a mum of two babies this will haunt me. How could any parent do this to their kids? It's a well made documentary that I think does justice to this poor lady, and those innocent little girls...Heartbreaking",True
5,7,interesting,moviematthewh-60783,n/a,16/08/2025,A better Netflix crime story. Why? Because it's only the real footage or news stories that's used in the film. It's not filled with people being interviewed talking about the event from the past which just pads the runtime. It works better and keeps you invested with body cams and real police interviews. Nothing is staged. It's all real.,False
6,9,A uniquely styled documentary that works extremely well,jtindahouse,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerUsually I absolutely despise spoilers, but 'American Murder: The Family Next Door' is actually one time I would recommend knowing the final result of before going in. I had this spoiled for me before watching and ultimately actually ended up being happy that it happened. The reason for this is that the most fascinating part of this documentary was watching the killer's movements throughout the runtime. Watching how they acted knowing full well what they'd done. It's one thing to watch a guilty character in a movie move about, but a whole other watching a real life person do it.This documentary was captivating from start to finish. It's unlike any documentary I've seen before in the sense that it contains zero current interviews. All the footage is from police body-cams, surveillance footage, interview room footage and Facebook footage. It almost feels like a real movie in that sense. I understand why not many documentaries are lucky enough to have this much footage available to them, but if they do they should absolutely always use it.This is a heart-breaking story. The details of the crime are absolutely devastating. It's not an easy watch. It is proof that pure evil does exist in this world sadly. It is a very well-made documentary though and well worth your time to watch it. I highly recommend this one.",True
7,7,Concise doc,Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,"A concise documentary covering the disappearance of shannan watts and her two children, and the subsequent investigation. The timeline was well established and well presented. The first hand footage was quite extensive.",False
8,9,This is heart breaking to say the least,andibrag,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can only say that I maybe the only one who was not aware of this terrible crime committed. Using Police body cam , Personal home movies. Facebook and text messages this had me gripped from start to finish. I was absolutely glued. I was left emotional and drained.",False
9,6,Good doc,ajn-75936,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAmerican Murder: The Family Next Door is a great doc that really shows what a true monster Chris Watts was. I remember watching the same uploaded body cam footage on YouTube while this case was happening, however I would've enjoyed a more narrative story to the doc explaining key points throughout. One point being that you can clearly see how nervous Watts was being in front of police and neighbors when they were watching him put his own wife's body in his truck. If the doc had expert criminal psychologists or law enforcement who were involved with the case share their thoughts and story, would've been a nice addition to the doc and give it more insight. The ending was so gut wrenching how he described what ultimately happened to his family, crazy to think how twisted people can be in this world.",True
10,9,Unflinching look at a murderer.,aamir9010,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBefore watching this I had heard about this particular case, but my mind was blown when they were looking at the neighbors footage. At that point you can see how he changes his expression and gets all nervous.Great use of footage and body cams it made us seem like we're were part of the entire investigation. Another Netflix documentary hit out of the park!",True
11,6,Like watching a plane crash,edwin-wks,n/a,16/08/2025,"Other than stitching up vignettes in a chronological order, this documentary offers barely any new insight to the Watts familicide. It has been nearly two years since his incarceration and there are no recent interviews with the killer or family members.The story plays like an episode of Air Crash Investigation (minus the investigation) - multiple failures must occur to precipitate the ultimate catastrophe. Chris stalks Shanann on Facebook. Shanann agrees to meet but would repeatedly rebuff Chris' advances. But why? Best guess would be her feelings of inadequacy about herself and her lupus. She finally succumbs to his charm and agrees to marry him. But Chris' family fails to attend his wedding because Cindy, his mother, does not approve of Shanann and does not want to lose her son to her. What does this say of Cindy? It would take a deeply narcissistic person to make her son's wedding about her and sabotage her son's happiness.According to the neighbours, Chris Watts is a subdued man. In his text messages to his wife, we see a man whose words do not reflect his actions. This is a man so accustomed to putting on a performance that he probably does not have a coherent sense of self because he has dedicated his life to appeasing everyone around him, not least his mother. According to Shanann's friends, she is ""bossy""; in other words, she is a control freak. This is consistent with her anxious and validation-seeking personality. She massively over-reacts while at her in-laws despite an already tenuous relationship with Cindy. Her text messages to her friends and husband also do not paint a portrait of someone with healthy emotional regulation. Despite all of her protestations via text messages and hand-written letters to her husband detailing her anguish, she seems incapable of having face-to-face discussions with him without flying off the handle. This was a couple in dire need of relationship counselling and the basics of effective interpersonal communication.Nothing can bring back Shanann and the kids. Just as the lessons of air crashes have made air travel safer and prevented more lives lost unnecessarily to air crashes, these tragedies hopefully serve as cautionary tales to couples in toxic or unfulfilling relationships. Get help as soon as issues arise. Most of all, do not flog a dead horse. Sometimes the best thing to do is simply to walk away calmly with dignity.",False
12,9,"Shocking and sad, and not only the murders",jckhammer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerVery shocking account of a domestic murder. There are a number of more complete footage clips on you tube that are shown here in this movie and if someone desires they can search for even more explanation on how Chris eventually was caught. One commenter here mentions the audio is hard to hear and its a guessing game in the interrogation room....nonsense. Unless this commentator is illiterate, there are full subtitles and there is no guessing. Ignore that review. In addition to the actually murders of the children it is almost equally disturbing and at at the number of superstar detectives behind there phones and screens that think they know all what went on. Many people were claiming Chris innocence and threats against the wife's family. Social media is a curse .",True
13,7,"Impressive work, yet terrible story",marno76,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am italian. Did not know anything about the story.It's so well done, so immersive that you think it's a movie.Technically is a masterpiece - the editing is impressive and innovative thanks - and the pain it makes you feel is unbearable.Alas since it is and was all real, it leaves you with lots of question.How does a brain can work with total denial instead than facing the facts of life?I think mr Watts brain saw his family has an obstacle to his happiness and decided to remove it altogheter by force instead than going trough a ""normal"" divorce.Accepting failure should be normal.A case entirely similar, if not identical, happened in Italy: check for the Carlo Lissi case.",True
14,5,"Story is heartbreaking, but retreads ground",fishfingerscustard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a tragic real life story, but you can get even more evaluation and educational content from the YT documentary on this story by JCS Criminal Psychology.",True
15,6,Hit and miss,maxwellsnake24,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been on a bit of a Netflix documentary binge as of late and the only one I have got round to reviewing is this one, that's not to say it's the best, merely the freshest in my memory. The watts family seem to be living the American dream,outwardly happy and healthy, dad has a good job and mum dotes on their two adorable children whilst maintaining a healthy Facebook presence and a well ordered home in a respectable neighbourhood. So why then does a routine health check on the family home by a policeman one sunny weekday morning lead to revelations so dark, they shook an entire nation.I remember the watts family case at the time it was initially reported and it's no overstatement to say it was big news, what this documentary sets out to do its to fill in the details behind the lurid headlines regarding this case and in terms of access to information, few documentary makers can claim to have had more. We start with footage straight from a cop's body cam and over the next 70 minutes are shown hand written letters, facebook entries and private text conversations. You really do feel like you are an intrusive voyeur viewing the minutiae of someone else's life, it's that revelatory So why only a six rating? Well it's simple , whilst certain aspects of the case are revealed and expanded upon with explicit candidness, others are neglected. For example Chris watts's life is not explored in any great detail, all the viewer.can glean from the scant mentions of his back story is that he was once fat and now isnt. No insight into his character is given either, he remains just as enigmatic to me as he did before I watched this documentary. This oversight on the makers part is glaring, surely they had just as much access to his correspondences and private info as they did to others. Also for such a complex and enthralling case, an 70 odd minute running time is far too brief to do the story justice. A good documentary that had great potential.",False
16,8,Good luck ever trusting your spouse again after watching this.,matthewssilverhammer,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a fairly basic true crime mystery...but my God, the personal access, shocking details and masterful editing make it one of the most well-told of the over-crowded sub-genre.",False
17,6,No respect for privacy of the victims.,billiejoesmum,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was overall a good show for it's length. It could definitely be improved by being a short series and going more in depth, but it still exposed the deception fairly well.The reason I gave it a lower score was that it showed extremely personal communications from Shannan to her husband and friends, which her next of kin may have given consent for, but still took a lot of dignity and respect away from her IMO.I would be mortified, if after I'd been murdered, all the texts & letters discussing my sex life - in detail - were plonked on a screen for entertainment in a Netflix documentary.Things like 'I've taken a night shower, he knows that means I want sex' or 'I'm so horny today' should stay between either a couple, or the close friends one chooses to share it with, not the rest of the world.They could still have used most of the texts to demonstrate a marriage breaking down (or one person neglecting it), without using everything and leaving her some dignity.I know if it were possible, I'd be haunting the one who gave those permissions as well as the husband who murdered me and me children!",True
18,8,"So freaking depressing and, unfortunately, real",billyt33,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm a Dad, a proud Dad. I would do anything for my children, I mean Anything! This documentary made me so so mad! This person doesn't deserve to exist, he is an animal and something truly possessed this person. He's not a man, he's not a Dad...he doesn't even deserve to be described as a human. He's a pitiful excuse of flesh! No Dad is his right man would ever harm his babies or their Mommy...no matter what the relationship is like. Get a freaking divorce! That's all you had to do, you freaking loser! Give me 5 minutes with this low life, please! My heart breaks for those babies and the Mom that tried so hard to just be normal, have a family and be loved. No excuses man, this guy is the worst of the worst and this was one of the hardest shows I've ever watched. It's painful and unfortunately, it's real. Too sad for sure.",True
19,7,Well done,yevhenyia,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe issue with sound is probably the main pitfall in terms of production. I had to watch it with subtitles because it was challenging to understand the speakers, especially during the footage from the interrogation room. However, I would say that creating a documentary on the basis of the family's social media, police body cameras, and interrogation was on a plus side for me. It added realism to the story.
I understood what happened from the very beginning. It was an expression of relief on her husband's face that made everything clear. Yet, I would never understand why such cases occur. It is beyond my grasp. Yes, the wife was incredibly annoying or at least it appears so in the documentary. I would understand why her husband would want to divorce her. However, what is the point to continue living with a person you hate or, more so, conceiving another child. I'm more than sure now that he killed her and children instead of divorcing simply because of money issues. Divorce would meant that he had to pay child support, move out of the house, and find a better job because she earned the most of money and it was her house. It is possible that he married her for money as well because I do not believe she became that annoying and incredibly controlling all of a sudden. The documentary conclusion was correct, the murders were premeditated.",True
20,8,I wish I never heard of this movie,ivko,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's kind of amazing how the modern digital life is so extensively documented that a clever team of editors can take your social media accounts and the videos off your phone and make a fairly comprehensive movie of your life even after you've gone. That's what happened here; the production team assembled a detailed accounting of the lives of a family that experienced an unspeakable tragedy. By the end of the film you have a sense that you know these people, which is also part of the problem: the more you find yourself caring, the harder it will be to keep watching.I really struggled with the foregone conclusion that was the lives of this family. Some things are so horrible my brain just doesn't want to accept them. I watched the movie in fits, drawn on by morbid curiosity but forced to continuously stop by some childish part of my brain that believed that if I simply stopped watching then somehow the remaining unseen events of the film would be trapped in a time bubble that couldn't proceed until I did. If only life worked that way. I never did make it to the very end of the movie because I just never want to hear the full detail of certain events.The movie is well made, but painful to watch. I'll admit to a certain amount of tears, and a sincere wish that I'd never heard of the Watts family. I will never understand why certain people fought to remove the application of the death penalty; if I had those memories floating around my skull, I would think death would be my best friend. Instead I'll just hope certain people are around for a long, long time, getting visited every single damn day by others who know what this person did to kids.",True
21,6,Don't watch if sensitive,Mango-30793,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis will stay with me for a long time. Those 2 beautiful little angels deserved better. I thought it was very strange that Shannan shared every thought of her marriage with her friend by text but that's no reason for lifting a finger to harm anyone so I'm not victim blaming by saying that. He just seemed empty and devoid of all feeling. She seemed very concerned with constantly filming everything. Very weird relationship. But the worst part is the heartbreak of her family and their daughter and grandchildren being taken from them forever. I hope he rots in hell.,True
22,8,Thought I knew the full story...,erinchatters,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though I had previously watched crime shows on this tragic story, I felt this was done from a perspective in which focused on highlighting events that I either knew little or nothing about, which made for a sad but informative watch.",False
23,7,Orwellian or Kafkaesque? I can't decide,harchaast,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerImagine you're from the 1950s and this documentary is sent back in time and is your only glimpse of 70 years into the future. Hell, even by 2000s' standards this is incredibly Orwellian or Kafkaesque.A lot of critics here have rightly pointed out this is a lazy documentary. And it is, but that's the beauty of it. That a narrative can be weaved ENTIRELY from police footage, voluntary social media posts, and candid text messages, is in some respects a sad indictment on our narcissistic and paranoid society - the urge to micromanage our lives and image, overshare and over-surveil. No talking heads, no traditional narration, scant journalism, little legwork.Chris Watts is a monster. However that does not tell the whole story. Another interesting narrative touched on, but not quite fully fleshed out in the documentary, is masculinity in the 2010s-20s. The juggle that is entirely inconsistent with what we were taught by our fathers and grandfathers. The balancing act of being a doting husband while also retaining your 'manhood' and not being insecure about it. The reason why new media such as the Joe Rogan Podcast is popular with disaffected young men aged 18-35.There is almost no doubt that Chris felt strongly demasculated through his toxic marriage. That is not an excuse to murder your family, but is a topic that warrants further investigation. One could argue if he plead 'not guilty' he would have done a better service to society at large - to be probed on the 'why' ... why you would opt to murder your kids and not just get a divorce.I did not feel offended by the 'facts' towards the end - they were quietly dismantled by another review entitled ""Reciprocal?"" here. From a pure 'true crime documentary' point of view, this film probably sucks. You can find deeper investigation on YouTube, and if you're familiar with the case (I wasn't) this might offer nothing new. However, as a time-stamp commentary on our modern society, it does a good job.",True
24,5,Incomplete,Ye769234,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst off, for a documentary that's nothing but surveillance and body cam footage, it was exceptionally riveting. Unfortunately the filmmaker seemed incredibly uninterested in exploring why this tragedy happened. The simplest google search tells you this family was in financial armageddon, yet they're going on vacations, buying expensive trucks and a nice home, along with a having another kid? That seemed like important info that wasn't explored. Also this may not be for me to say but I refuse to believe that dirty girlfriend of his didn't have something to do with this. I was shocked by how disingenuous her sympathy for the family seemed along with the fact that her complaints about his lying seemed a calculated move to turn the investigators away from her. Oh and apparently she knew all about the family before she met Chris and was making phone calls to him around the time the murders happened! You know how much of this was explored in this film? Absolutely nothing. Instead you're left believing he was a normal man who just randomly killed his family when there is so many other details to this. Obviously because men are killers, right?",True
25,6,Unforgivable Tragedy,shot-36628,n/a,16/08/2025,"This case will stay with me forever.
I don't know exactly what makes it so compelling, but maybe it's Shanann's social media presence that makes us feel like we know her as a neighbor and friend.
It is just so unfathomable how this guy could actually go through wiping out not ONLY his wife, but his own two daughters in the space of hours, and act like nothing was out of the ordinary.
There was another case same year,- Kelsey Berreth in Woodland Park, CO. Her ""fiance"" Patrick Frazee, bludgeoned her to death in her condo with their infant daughter in back bedroom. He had been trying to get another girlfriend to do the job for him. I compare him to Chris Watts.. I've been reading how an ex-girlfriend described him, of the ""mind games"" he would play with her, and how he was thought of as so charming, laid back, nice guy. Very eerily similar to Chris Watts.
It seems these psychopaths are all about control. They see their children as ""property"" that they are entitled to, that belongs soley to them. Patrick Frazee was upset that Kelsey wanted full custody of their daughter, and wanted to move away from him, closer to Pueblo where she worked as a pilot instructor. He plotted to kill her, then finally did it himself.
I think that's what set Chris off the night he killed Shanann. He knew she would take the kids away from him, and to him that was giving her control over him, his life, his ""property"". Psychopaths can't have that. They would rather kill than give up their control over their ""property"".
True, he could have just divorced. But, Shanann would take the kids, which meant the ""ultimate failure"" to him. It's strange, but to them it makes sense. I think that's the main reason he did what he did.",False

1,10,Addressing the sound issues,omouallem,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hi, I'm the filmmaker. The reason I'm leaving this 10/10 review is because it's the only way for me to address the other reviews about the sound mix (and obviously I'm not giving my movie anything less than a 10).So, unfortunately subscribers of Paramount+ channel via Prime/AppleTV have to suffer through a faulty audio mix causing the music to overpower the dialogue. We've tried repeatedly and with much frustration to ask P+ to fix it, but they have shown apathy towards addressing the issue, which is not only insulting to its customers but the artists behind our film.This is in no way representative of musician Ashraf El-Assaly or sound designer Johnny Blerot, both of whom received award nominations for their work on this film. I'd personally rather you not watch the Lebanese Burger Mafia at all than try to than try to endure this version with subtitles.To our knowledge, this issue occurs exclusively when watching through Prime's P+ subscription channel. If you're beholden to Paramount+ as a Prime channel, you have other options.1. Cancel the P+ Prime sub and re-sign up directly through the P+ app (the cost is the same).2. Watch the movie on Prime Video via laptop or tablet/phone apps. Although these methods may not be the most ideal, they do not experience the audio problem.3. Rent the film on Apple TV, Google Play, YouTube, or another VOD platform.We also encourage you to contact Paramount+ and voice your frustrations with their poor customer experience.",False
2,9,Interesting,mac_haggis,n/a,15/08/2025,"I went to see this with a friend and honestly did not have much in terms of expectations. I am not much of a documentary person, let alone one about a burger franchise. I was pleasantly surprised at how interesting I found the topic, having driven by Burger Baron multiple time but never stopping to try it out. Now I want to try it.It brought to light a very interesting history to the franchise chain and had some funny moments to it as well. I believe writer/director Omar Mouallem put together a really decent doc and I hope it sees the success he is looking for. I believe the film is still making the festival rounds but I definitely recommend that others check it out if they get the opportunity.",False

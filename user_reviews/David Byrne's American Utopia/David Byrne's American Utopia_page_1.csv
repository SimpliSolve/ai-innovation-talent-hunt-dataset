1,9,Most probably one of the best concert movies i have ever seen,recumb123,n/a,16/08/2025,"David Byrne is well known to everybody who was born at least half a century ago. As the frontman of Talking Heads his genius literally was the core of the band. This movie shows that his brilliance has not withered yet. American Utopia is a well chosen name for a time document that alternates fantastic music with witty comments on life in general and American life specifically. The world has changed a lot the last 50 years, but a lot of things have stayed the same and the peculiar way David Byrne is looking to the world has essentially not changed either, and that is a good thing.
What is remarkable is that the vibe, the rythm, the choreography and lighting for almost every song is unique. David is always center stage, but the rest of the dancers and musicians are equally important.
In one word; a musical masterpiece.",False
2,9,An Artsy Musical Show Not to be Missed,mojo-98073,n/a,16/08/2025,Never saw a bad David Byrne show. An enjoyable romp in today's culture. A tender and soft musical journey from a voice which has barely aged since 1976. You'll find yourself bobbing your head at times to the rhythmic melodies. A true artist.,False
3,9,Wonderfully entertaining,grantss,n/a,16/08/2025,"Director Spike Lee captures David Byrne's Broadway show American Utopia on film. The show features many of Byrne's Talking Heads tracks plus solo stuff of his and versions of other people's work. Byrne links all the songs together with narration, especially on social issues.Brilliant. I didn't know what to expect from this as I didn't have a good idea what American Utopia is. My initial thought was that it was a musical play produced by David Byrne, complete with sets and original songs, a Hamilton-style production.Turns out it's much simpler than that, and better. Essentially a live performance of a mix of Byrne's musical catalogue, leaning on Talking Heads stuff but with quite a lot of other things thrown in. There's a social narrative running through the production and Byrne contributes some interesting, often profound, commentary between songs.The music makes the show though. Even though most of the songs are ones you've heard before, especially if, like me, you're a Talking Heads fan, the renditions of them are superb.The band is excellent - every member is sublimely talented - and everything is perfectly choreographed. This is not simply a live concert where the musicians play their instruments and that's it. No, there's a huge degree of theatre to it all and it takes the performance to another level.Yet, despite this perfect set-piece display it's clear that this is a whole lot of fun. Amazing talent, creativity and professionalism on display.A must-watch for all lovers of the performing arts and good music, especially Talking Heads fans.",False
4,10,Just....wow,rachbruno,n/a,16/08/2025,"This blew me away. I'm a huge fan of Byrne and he's only gotten better with age. This was so incredible, it was inspiring, moving, inclusive, and hopeful. The music, the instruments, the musicians, the dancing...all of it was just so unbelievably great. Can't say enough good things about this.",False
5,10,Riveting music documentary,UniqueParticle,n/a,16/08/2025,"An incredible David Byrne frontman of Talking Heads experience! Spike Lee joint not much like it. The music is soothing, well choreographed, and the in between bits where David Byrne talks to the audience is wonderful! One of the most enjoyable HBO specials in a long while.",False
6,9,A stunning musical film.,SnobReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mesmerizing, sensational and life-affirming; ""American Utopia"" brings the Broadway musical home and explodes off the TV.In this concert film, director Spike Lee documents David Byrne, the former Talking Heads frontman's 2019 Broadway show.David Bryne has always been some kind of weird guy, but he's also always been so cool. It really shows in ""American Utopia"" the cool guy Byrne is. The band is incredible, the set list is divine and the stage set-up is simple yet intricate. Spike Lee brings his flair and some cool camera set-ups all over the stage, to really make you feel like you're in that theatre. A fun but also a powerful concert that will you have you standing in your living room and stomping your feet. I absolutely loved this film.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!",False
7,8,Wonderful Reinvention,aspicco,n/a,16/08/2025,"I liked this a lot more than I expected. Stellar performances from all, very enjoyable and David Byrne comes across very genuine... altho' I think it should have been called David Byrne Sings The Hits of Talking Heads",False
8,9,stunning and bears repeated views,davidm-14,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are a david byrne fan (and i have been since their first album way back when), this is a not-to-be missed visual treat. he is still just as stunning on stage as he always has been. he's surrounded himself with dancers, percussionists and keyboards, while playing some new and some (thank goodness) old favorites. reminds me of how timeless this man's music is. the visuals and lighting, dancing and all aspects are perfect. highly recommended. good job spike lee!",False
9,10,Brilliant,jeremy-537-388288,n/a,16/08/2025,I thought Stop Making Sense was the best concert I'd ever seen until American Utopia came to town. I jumped at reliving it on the big screen. It's beautifully captured by Lee. The care he takes with including so many extraordinary on-stage moments is exemplary. David Byrne is so likable and he tells the story of the show beautifully. His musicianship and vocals are wonderful. But the real star of the show is the staging. It's bewilderingly detailed and beautifully crafted. The skill set the performers require is astonishing. The band literally dance the whole night through. Two dancers who double as backing singers drip with charisma and are provided with delightful moves. This is a joyful experience. I loved every second.,False
10,6,solid,mbrcf,n/a,16/08/2025,"What I wanted and anticipated to get from this broadway show:Great music by the ex-Talking Heads frontman and modern music icon David Byrne and his team of instrumentalists and musicians. Check. Thanks Mr. Byrne for your great music.Great broadway performance, choreography and a mindful, rich way to bring them to the silver screen. Also check. Thanks Mr. Spike Lee and everyone else involved with this project.What I did NOT want or care to see nor to hear but I got them anyway:A set of really insightful, caring and heartfelt messages totally and completely unheard about human rights, immigrant rights, climate change and global warming stuff, go vote!, trump hate (yeah let's hate that dude real hard, it's cool) and the list goes on. It's not that these messages are untrue or mischievous, but after listening to them so many times anywhere and everywhere, I've grown somewhat allergic to them.In any case, the film is solid, go drop a watch and nevermind me, I'm just ranting.",False
11,10,Concert Films LITERALLY Do Not Get Any Better Than This,anthony_ian,n/a,16/08/2025,"I gave this my first-ever 10-star IMDB review, it was that good. I was smiling endlessly and even clapped after some songs. It's that good. If you thought ""Stop Making Sense"" was a film pinnacle Byrne would never top--he did. It's that good.Caveat: if you don't like Talking Heads or Byrne solo, this probably won't change your mind. Or maybe it will.The whole concept of making the musicians mobile (all of them can move around, none of them are seated, and they take their instruments with them) opens up endless possibilities visually and Byrne captures endless ones.The band is just insanely good-every song has a furious percussive backbeat which makes this all work, most notably on ""Once in a LIfetime"". Yes, there are PLENTY of Talking Heads songs here to keep fans happy.But pretty much everything works, the spoken parts (which are few) are funny and/or thoughtful and the staging/lighting is striking. Spike Lee, who directed, does a great job of not overdoing it with fancy angles or flashy edits, so he gets mad props here too. And the sound mix is AWESOME, one of the best I've ever heard for a concert film.Everything about this is great. Best thing I've seen from Broadway since Hamilton. But it really *is* more of a concert than a musical.",False
12,7,"""A Platitude of Stupidity""",owen-watts,n/a,16/08/2025,"Byrne's lockdown stage extravaganza still exudes an extraordinary vibrancy, but seen during the midst of everything it must have felt overwhelming. The theme is ""connection"" and the vibe is ""deceptive simplicity"" the matching grey suits and bare staging mask a two hour performance that is almost mind-bogglingly intricate. Byrne balks against backing tracks and overdubs in the show itself but Lee's film does certainly employ a few, stitched fairly seamlessly together from a few performances and maybe a rehearsal or two which lends it a slight uncanny air. Still - it's a remarkable piece of work and the sheer breadth and variety of it is intoxicating.",False
13,4,I guess you need to come into this as a David Byrn fan.,garnet-suss,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew little to nothing about the man prior to watching this, perhaps that's why I found it pretty weird and boring. Too artsy for my taste, and I thought the music sucked. ü§∑üèª
Almost all the positive reviews are from die hard Byrn and Talking Heads fans. If you aren't one of them, you may not enjoy this. I found him to be EXTREMELY boring, almost void of any emotion at all.I'm sure this review will be ""downvoted"" into oblivion but I thought 'an outsider' should leave a review for other outsiders to see. I'm actually surprised that even die hard fans are giving this a 10/10, because it really isn't deserving of that rating. Perhaps they're doing that to try and counter the negative ratings? I don't see how anyone, even a huge fan, could think this play was worthy of a rating higher than maybe a 7/10. It's just beyond me how anyone could think this is a near perfect play, because it is not.",False
14,10,"""Unfortunately, I am what I am.""",matthewssilverhammer,n/a,16/08/2025,"This thing is nearly impossible to categorize. Concert + Broadway production + ""one""-man show + avant-garde performance art + Ted Talk + stand-up comedy + VH1 Storytellers. It's unique and weird, yet utterly unpretentious, a joint celebration and critique of human nonsense. The songs rule, the band rules, the choreography rules, Spike Lee rules, David Byrne rules. I couldn't wait to watch it again, even while I was still watching it.",False
15,8,Something old and something new,cliftonofun,n/a,16/08/2025,"Earlier this year I revisited Stop Making Sense, the classic rock concert doc from the Talking Heads and Jonathan Demme. In many ways, David Byrne makes more sense in Broadway theatre than in a rock venue. The visual elements, dramatic flare, and eccentricities all feel totally at home here. Regardless of venue (or even director), the vision of American Utopia is absolutely unparalleled. Byrne transforms familiar songs and elements into something entirely new, and Spike Lee captures the energy of the room so well that you feel like you are there. You are left with more than a concert or musical...it is something old and new all at once.",False
16,9,Easily one of the year's best films,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"When the movie opened with David Byrne singing a song to a brain, and said song to said brain made me feel emotional, I knew this was going to be something special.Absolutely great stuff: a great show with great music filmed exceptionally well. It's also a great companion piece to the classic Stop Making Sense, and honestly on a similar level quality wise.Who knew Spike Lee and David Byrne could combine their talents so effectively to make something so great? All the Talking Heads songS I was familiar with sounded great, and I really enjoyed the songs in here that I wasn't familiar with too.If you're a fan of David Byrne you'll love this, and it's so good that even if you weren't already a fan, it might well convert you.",False
17,9,It's all making sense,donnyduo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Byrne is a genius, his talent, vocals, theatre hasn't change in almost half a decade. What a performer. I only wish I could have been there to share this experience.",False
18,8,Almost as good as being in the room.,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was one of my favourite gigs a couple of years back, certainly the most innovative show I've witness in, well ever! David Byrne's American Utopia is as much theatre as it is concert and as a result probably works better as a recorded concert film than most. I'm not going to tell you in matches the live performance. You can't replicate being in the room, feeling that spark of the occasion and sharing it with thousands. We can't share anything live right now though of course, so having this recording is something of a blessing. Here you get the luxury of multiple cameras, close ups, alternative perspectives and there is a lot to see. Live the show looks bravely simplistic. Byrne and his band, barefoot and decked out in matching grey suits, housed in box made of chain curtains, one side open to the audience. Every song is injected with creative lighting and dancing. It's every bit the performance. Unless you're a big Talking Heads fan, a traditional show might be dull, expected. Not hear though, it's wonderful whether you're a fan or not. This I think is largely due to it all looking so much damn fun, it's a celebration of music. The wires, amps, drum risers are all striped away. Each player is wireless, allowed to move freely and dance around one another. Not too surprising with the singers and the guitars, but to do this with keyboards and drums too, especially drums theres some seriously clever stuff going on there, well it looks like magic. It really is quite incredible, a good live band is a good live band, they're tight and controlled, fluid. To do it with this many players, whilst following choreographed routines is stunning. Byrne is charming and humble as he delivers short monologues between songs and he's in fine voice too. I am a fan, not a huge fan, but you get plenty of big hits alongside the American Utopia tracks to keep everyone happy and even through the screen, the joy of this music comes through. Perhaps most of all when the chains part in the curtains and more band members appear. With so much space, it's not unusual for a dozen people to perform together, creating not only a wonderful visual, but a fantastic sound too. Byrne is the conductor at the centre, orchestrating his vision. One of positivity and inclusivity. It's marvellous.",False
19,10,As live shows go what more could you ask for!?,vanlauren,n/a,16/08/2025,"Talent, professionalism, entertainment, uplifting fun, intimate messaging between songs for a lovely rappore with the audience. Bravo David and Spike!",False
20,6,Good for 20 minutes,mformoviesandmore,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show starts with a fairly stark environment, as you might expect in secne one of many a play.The songs are pleasant ditties to nod along to.And then it just keeps going. And then more of the same.And then there are old Talking Heads songs. And champagne socialism.I started skipping forward after 20 minutes. That's how I saw the other bits.And those bits were enough for me.",False
21,10,Speachless!,mahashemi,n/a,16/08/2025,The best thing I have seen this year .Amazingly capturing such a unique and soulful performance. I can't even begin to imagine the amount of work put into the design and choreography specially how everyone's individual spirit and character is so present on the stage while being woven with other performances into such a complex tapestry.,False
22,6,I wanted to like this film,Lovetvshows,n/a,16/08/2025,I wanted to like this film but the politics of the movie ruined it for me. I thought I was going to watch a concert film but instead what I got was some old man giving his unsolicited political opinions. The songs would have been great if they were played without commentary. I also find it hard to watch David Byrne singing Talking Head songs without the original band. The only reason I gave this movie a six rating is for the visuals. The lighting and colors of this film were impeccable.,False
23,5,Hypocrisy from a notorious bridge-Byrner,alexdmcintosh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had an uncle who decided one day to abandon his two young sons and wife, who was still pregnant with their third child. He now lives in a different province as an upstanding family man, businessman and church member. But he is a scumbag and complete fraud to anyone who really knows him.I say this to explain the ickiness I got from Byrne's message in American Utopia and to compare it with who he really is. Anyone who knows the history of Talking Heads' breakup knows Byrne is egotistical and ""incapable of returning friendship"". I don't need platitudes about peace and love from a man who used, abandoned, actively tried to hinder and can't make peace with the band that made him who he is today. I'm sure Jerry, Tina and Chris would agree.Byrne is an outstanding musician and artist, and I will always be a fan, but a message of understanding and tolerance from him and the hatemonger Lee using the music of his former family is ugly and in poor taste. Watch AU and enjoy, but don't ignore the truth about the feel-good, flower-power message. 5 stars only due to the timeless TH songs.",False
24,10,Absolutely AMAZING!,rwheatley-58978,n/a,16/08/2025,"So grateful I've had the chance to watch the show over here in the UK. Was up dancing in my lounge practically the whole way through! Would've given anything to see that live on Broadway. Just pure awesomeness on so many levels. Congrats to David, Spike and all those talented musicians. What a triumph!",False
25,10,New best concert movie,kemmysunshine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stand aside David Byrne. Stop Making Sense is no longer the best concert movie ever made.
You have been usurped by yourself a mere 36 years later.
What an experience this is. The reliance on the personality of each of the participants is astonishingly clever. As Byrne himself explains, the stripped back visual experience make you focus on the people and not the hardware.
Incredibly astute and remarkably timely.
Best ¬£7:99 I have ever spent.
Watched it 3 times in a row.",False

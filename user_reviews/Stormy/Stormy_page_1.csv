1,7,Put the politics aside- a well-made documentary,ericrwiksten,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI enjoyed this sordid trip down memory lane. The film is really half news documentary and half biography-as-it-happened of Stormy Daniels. It tells the story, I believe truthfully, of the brief affair and stalking of Stormy Daniels by Donald Trump. This films deals with the unwanted and dangerous attention of trump supporters who threaten and openly despise Stormy while ignoring the other half of this affair.In the news documentary portion, we see trump for what he is, a deceptive cheat who used his influence and celebrity to lure a woman half his age into his hotel room. We see the news clips, the evolution of Michael Avenetti, and the corruption of Guiliani with the hindsight to know what happened to these men.On the biography side, we meet a woman who came from a very broken home, with a broken mother, who grew up in Baton Rouge, LA. Mentions are made of a molesting neighbor, of her introduction to the adult entertainment industry, first through dancing then to film, to worldwide recognition. Sadly, get to watch the dissolution of her marriage and her trying to protect her young daughter from the reality of the situation, I think of all the characters in this entire film, her husband of a decade was the most sympathetic character. He was caught up in an insane situation not of his making.So, if you can put your either reverance or disdain of Trump aside, I think you may enjoy this film. The film does not idolize or demonize the characters, but presents them in an honest, understandable light.",True
2,7,Surprisingly effective documentary,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""Stormy"" (2023 release; 110 min.) opens, it is ""March 30, 2023"" as Trump is criminally indicted for the hush payment made in Fall of 2016 to Stormy Daniels to cover up his affair with her in 2006. In 2018, the Wall Street Journal reports on the hush payment, and all hell breaks loose. We then go back in time as we learn of Stormy's troubled youth in Baton Rouge, LA... At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: let me state upfront that while of course I am aware of the hush payment and Trump's subsequent lying about it, I was not aware of all the details. Much of the footage in the documentary comes from 2018, detailing with the fallout after the WSJ's report. With Trump's and the White House's machination in full force and effect, it is literally a David v. Goliath battle: the President of the United States v. A porn star. Along the way we get almost unfettered access to what that felt like as it plays out in real life. Check out the media frenzy, and the enormous pressure Stormy faced (and still faces) from the MAGA world. It's absolutely insane. Meanwhile Trump continues to deny, deny, deny. But soon (in mid-April or so) the chickens are coming home to roost for Orange Jesus... Please note that the overall rating of this documentary here in IMDb (currently 5.2 stars) is grossly misleading, as there are hundreds of ratings but less than 10 reviews so far. Almost certainly much of these ratings have come from white trash Let's Go Brandon MAGA folks who have not seen the documentary, and are too dumb to recognize a quality documentary if it hit them in the face. (""Stormy"" is currently rated a very respectable 71% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.)""Stormy"" started streaming on Peacock earlier this week, and I caught it last night. I was quite surprised how effective this documentary turned out to be. If you are interested in politics, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
3,6,A human story,okpilak,n/a,15/08/2025,"If one is looking for a salacious story of a low functioning woman, that is not her. It is a documentary about her life, and when she met Donald, she was already writing and producing, and hoped to make a horror film. Trump dangled the chance to be on Celebrity Apprentice, saying he had the veto-proof right to pick one person to be on the program. It is less about what happened with him than it is how it upended her life. Taken advantage of by male lawyers, at first just insulted, then threatened and stalked, making it almost impossible for her 7 y/o daughter to have a life. When she could not get jobs in the US, she set up a tour in Canada, only to find out that the FBI crime computer had an extensive list of arrests, which never happened. But she lost entry into Canada because of that. More lawsuits, and then the threats became more as death threats of a serious nature. In the end she says she doesn't want Trump to go to prison, but she is willing to go to prison rather than pay the judgment Trump got against her for legal fees. During the height of the Me-too movement, she got a lot of support from woman, but it also took a huge toll on her.",False
4,7,Different,dps-72811,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerDidn't know what to expect other than crying and whining from all the big tough MAGA dudes taking a break from watching anime in mom's basement, but the documentary shows someone who grew up broken but actually made something of herself. She's an intelligent woman and not afraid to stand up to a bloated, orange letch.Her desire to be a good mother after getting robbed by her own parents are to be commended. Her sacrifices to keep her daughter out of the creepy media are admirable. It's so painful listening to the bleating from Mango Mussolini and his non stop blathering lies. The Avenatti stuff is also a bit of karma. Forgot about the FBI stuff too. Gee, how could that have happened?Expect MAGA tears.",True
5,7,Well directed important documentary,bashiirahammed,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhenever I watch a documentary, I always ask myself did I get the full insight of the topic the film is covering? Was it from an objective point of view of the director? Was is unnecessary fatty? Well, in the case of 'Stormy', this documentary does cover the intended point of the film which is how Stormy Daniels faces and deals with everything from a personal point of view. And it does surely cover that. Director may not have been objective. Understandably so, as she was trying to also cover the woman side of her and how she is facing the whole charade as a woman. If the director wanted she could include a lot of unnecessary sensationalized element as Stormy does have a lot of sexual contents available. But the director hardly went there and focused on the main fact of how this whole legal and social fight is affecting Stormy and how she is dealing with it.As a film, I liked the structure of the story but the shots were a bit too static. That is one sector maybe the director could focus. The color was good, editing was to the point, sound was perfect.Maybe the journalists introduced should have gotten more airtime and also Stormy's childhood friends. Maybe some of her co-workers could have been introduced. The fact that the director didn't just jump on the ways porn is done as a sub plot(which a lot of the directors tend to do) is a big plus.Overall, a good one and an important one from the point we are standing in history.",True
6,9,Oh Stephanie...You believed him... SMH,dannyv-56907,n/a,15/08/2025,"While I will admit I didn't have a lot of sympathy for her going into the movie it changed my outlook on her and the... Shall we call it short affair?. For the most part when she spoke about him promising you an appearance in a season of The Apprentice she should have known it was a lie. Trump had a long history of screwing people he made promises to way before she met him. Just a quick Google search would have found her all the subcontractors he cheated while building the Atlantic City casino's... Not to mention the hundreds thrown out of work when they went bust (who ever heard of a casino losing money SMH)... But after watching the whole movie I was sorry for what she had to give up... I can't imagine what it felt like to have to give up custody of your daughter just to keep her safe and keep her from being assaulted by camera's where ever she went. Yes this documentary, which I might add was well shot, showed she made some bad choices (early on and some later) but I applaud her strength in telling her story at all.. She was in the right, but It took bravery to go through what she did and is doing.. Stay strong lady, You're fighting the good fight.",False
7,5,SHAME on Denver Nicks,orcinussr,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerDocumentarian who had an affair with Stormy Daniels , during filming - I'm sorry but Im at the scene with the glancing disclosure of said affair and I'm disgusted - it absolutely destroys the neutral bias of the film ABSOLUTELY - it's one thing to be a filmmaker and develop feelings for your subjects, sympathy or empathy, concerns or worry - but yet another to engage in a sexual and emotional relationship with said subject PARTICULARLY when the subject is dealing with sexual affairs and interactions and personally, the fact that she was married at the time is even more appalling - I feel he exploited the situation and unfortunately it can't be said that he didn't now that it's occurred - it's just sad - and I wish her all the best but it's uh.. Ugh - ya Shame on Denver Nicks.",True
8,8,Fascinating insight into the Stormy affair,originalveghead,n/a,15/08/2025,"Seeing the events of the time through Stormy Daniels' eyes is truly fascinating and not a little scary. The fear she experienced as a result of the hateful barrage of abuse is palpable. On top of this the dirty tricks from the powerful people she upset are really eye opening.The film does not editorialize, instead letting the events speak for themselves. Stormy is not portrayed as anything but herself, certainly not as a hero, but as her personal life is slowly torn apart it's hard not to feel sorry for her despite her mistakes. What's clear is that she was abused, and then punished for it, and her family was torn apart by the flak. There are no winners here.",False
9,3,Just another hit piece against Trump,expresscontent,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stormy Daniel said she didn't want to see Trump but then met up with him in a hotel room and had an intimate thing with him on the first night. Despite claiming she didn't want to do it, blah blah blah, she basically sold her body in exchange for future jobs with a rich man.This documentary is one sided against Trump and totally neglected that maybe Stormy was the one who wanted to extract money from a wealthy man (let alone a future president back then).This documentary doesn't age well and now the world has moved on and last I heard, she still owes Trump money after losing her defamation lawsuit against him.",False
10,10,Excellent Documentary exposing FACTs,Mythblaster,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's mind numbing how certain individuals perceive any factual revelations exposing Trump's extensive history of fraudulent enterprises, deceitful dealings, ongoing lies and fabrications, sexual misconduct, and his penchant for portraying himself as a victim, merely as a ploy by the media to undermine a President.Individuals who earnestly embrace the notion that he is a victim and adamantly disregard any critical media coverage as falsehoods targeting him demonstrate a significant detachment from reality. Their unwavering allegiance suggests a deep-seated adherence to a cult-like mentality.This mindset is characterized by an unquestioning loyalty to a leader figure, often at the expense of rational analysis and critical thinking. It's as though they've become so entrenched in a narrative crafted by their chosen leader that they are unable or unwilling to objectively assess the information presented to them. This behavior not only shields the individual from uncomfortable truths but also perpetuates a dangerous cycle of misinformation and blind faith.This documentary is spot on. If Stormy Daniel's actually just wanted to do a hit job on trump she could have done a whole lot worse than what she expressed in this documentary.",False
11,10,Very valuable and well done.,roreeewhite,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well made, riveting, and an important piece of contemporary history. Bravery of a perfectly imperfect normal human being, rising to a level of bravery and persistent survivalism, that sets her apart and above the fray. In today's quicksand-like morass of gutless money and ego chasing humans, the non pretentious Stephanie Clifford/Stormy Daniels, lands somewhere in between the biblical figures of Tamar, Rahab, and the woman caught inn Adultery, in terms of an unlikely, but actual, human hero, human-in-distress, human being used by others, but continuing to fight and define and redefine where she is at, what are her goals, at each changing chapter in this historical drama unfolding before our eyes. My prayers and admiration for this woman and gratitude to her and the film makers and the honesty of herself and also to her ex-husband musician-guy, who along with Ms. Daniels, show love at both sides of a romance and marriage that both blossomed and then was crushed amidst all this, and the frailty of imperfect human choices evolving through this trial by fire.",False
12,9,Riveting story told honestly,magicmarven,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie shows that Stormy Daniels shows a huge amount of courage by standing up for herself against one of the most dangerous people in American history. The documentary remains fascinating throughout, because the story is fascinating throughout. I have a newfound respect for Stormy Daniels; where she came from, and where she got to by never giving up. Unfortunately, her story is not that different from too many women today who have suffered under men who would abuse them, and take them for granted. I hope this documentary broadcasts her story to many more people, so that they can know the truth of what happened to her.",False
13,10,Riveting and powerful,shereenduke,n/a,15/08/2025,"As someone who is totally uncomfortable with what Stormy does for a living and political sex scandals from Clinton to Trump, I was amazed how impressed I was with her resilience as a woman and a mother on every level. She navigated a very difficult childhood and jumped on opportunities that came her way to survive. The unsavory porn business is one thing but that is Trumps world. Trump was friends with Epstein and seducing a 27-year-old Stormy with sex in exchange for furthering her career and reneging is despicable. Her story and strength are beyond just entertaining because it's a true story. Respect and thanks to her and the people who did such a great job on this documentary.",False
14,5,A voyeuristic reality show like documentary about an unfortunate woman and situation,Lolarobot,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Stormy Daniels documentary provided a compelling insight into the intersection of power, politics, and personal choices. While it may have leaned towards a reality show format and exhibited bias, it effectively shed light on important societal issues. Therefore, I would rate it 5 stars for its thought-provoking content and its ability to expose the underbelly of power dynamics in the United States.Stormy Daniels has ultimately made very bad choices throughout her life, which led her to engaging in a parasitic relationship with Donald Trump, where she thought she could expand her career beyond porn and topless dancing. Sadly, this did not transpire, but she ultimately kept pushing for her 15 minutes of fame, which is sadly turned into a 15 year saga she seems to be very comfortable with sleeping with the documentarian, putting her child's life at risk, and losing important relationships for money. I don't want to blame her for these decisions, because she did have a very rough upbringing, so I do hope that she does well in the future. If you were looking for something unbiased, don't bother.",False
15,10,Stormy is such a strong woman to open herself to this scrutiny.,kfdynks,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI live in the UK and saw this movie on channel 5. I have only seen the headlines and not paid much attention to this case but now I learnt the truth. How a woman stood up for the truth and refused to be called a liar. I would have given in to the bully Donald Trump. Billionaires know the threat of litigation to regular people is so terrifying due to the massive costs involved that they usually back down. This is how DJT bullies people like Stormy. I was upset to see both Stormy and the journalist who created this move became briefly romantically involved and this adultery was a factoring her divorce. It is understandable how this happened with Stormy away from home and spending so much time with the journalist and sharing her thoughts and emotions but the journalist should have been professional and not allowed it to happen. The only fault I find in Stormy's story is that she came out of the bathroom and somehow ended up being humped by a 60 year old man and she could not recall how she got to the bed. It is more believable to say she slept with Trump because she wanted to seduce him and get on his show celebrity apprentice. Not remembering may be true but it feels like a narrative to maintain her good person appearance. The movie shows the was Stormy's live was torn apart by DJT. The movie also highlights the terrible circumstances of her childhood. Lack of parental love. Child neglect by her mother. I realise I care about what happens to STORMY DANIELS when I watched this film. I wish her happiness in her future. Stormy has many positives going for her with intelligence, strong work ethic, loving daughter and being attractive. At one point she says she just wants to be loved back. I hope she has been through counselling for her childhood sexual abuse. I hope we don't hear stories in the future that she has transitioned into drugs and her life has fallen into chaos which is so common in these situations. I fear most of all that DJT will be re-elected as president and the effect this will have on the world. Rome became so powerful it elected emperors who were psychologically damaged and Rome suffered the consequences. Let us hope that doesn't happen to the USA.",True
16,3,A Train Wreck,Musicianmagic,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before watching this I felt bad for Stormy Daniels. This changed my mind.Most of this movie is to make her out to be the victim for a slew of issues she has. But so much was & is self-inflicted.Especially consider that Denver Nicks filmed a lot of the footage (credited as Contributing Producer), appears several times & briefly is stated (hoping it will be missed) she had an affair with him. That affair cost her third marriage. Stormy says how it hurt her now ex-husband and others but at no time does she show any remorse. Completely ignores the fact she herself cheated on her husband.She several times mentions she wishes all the notoriety with her & Trump would go away. Yet she continues appearing on TV shows throughout even traveling to England to appear on a couple of shows. Obviously she wants the exposure.Yes I understand she gets hateful tweets as they are posted throughout the movie although usually with the name/handle blacked out. She has been taken advantage of by her former attorney. I have sympathy for those kind of things. But so much that is shown just seems self-inflicted. A train wreck.",False

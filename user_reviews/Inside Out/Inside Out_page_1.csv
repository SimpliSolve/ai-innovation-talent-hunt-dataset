1,9,Classic for the new generation? Yes!,Chaser923,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI just knew this was gonna be amazing. Such a great idea for an animated movie, even by Pixar's standards. It's truly a perfectly executed vision that did not disappoint on almost all levels. There's a lot of fun to be had with this, it's one of the funnier and more thought provoking Pixar movies. The scene where Bing Bong disappears is also extremely sad. I could also tell that this is one of Pixar's more mature films, about the struggles of growing up. It explored Nostalgia for most of the movie without even using the word. When sadness touched a core memory and turned it blue, it was a symbol for Riley feeling nostalgic for her best memories. In my book, this is yet another Pixar classic.",True
2,9,I feel like everybody has missed the point,james-calver,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldn't help reading several for this film on this site that just did't seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from.The majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was 'too depressing for a children's film', but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isn't all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life.From a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane.Overall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nanny-state we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what can't be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come.",False
3,9,I cried like a baby..,gloriesalbuainain,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched the movie long time ago, and I've just rewatched it today.
For kids it will be a funny movie with no meaning maybe!!
But for an adult, its so true!! You lose your childhood personality you change you feel sad, i mean it literally touches my soul
Great movie for both kids and adults.",False
4,10,The fact that this movie has so many 1 star reviews is proof that there is no point in making great movies anymore......,Reckno64,n/a,15/08/2025,"I hate to see so many 1 star reviews claiming this movie was ""too depressing"". Everyone who said that missed the point completely. Growing up ain't all sunshine and rainbows, it comes with a lot of hardships and that's what this movie is about. Riley's emotions try to help her through the difficulty of moving to a new place that isn't all its cracked up to be, and in the process Joy accidentally sends Riley into a deep depression. Sounds depressing, but what makes this movie great is how realistic her depression feels as Joy and Sadness try to help Riley out of it. I feel like this movie's message is ""Growing up will be tough, but you will get through it and there are people who will always help you through it."" and that is a VERY important message for children.Throughout the movie there are plenty of good jokes, gorgeous animation, and a beautiful score by Michael Giacchino (idk how to spell that....) Again, just my two cents, but I think this a great movie, if very different and a bit more depressing by Pixar standards.REALLY starting to think people are just coming to trash all of Pixar's most recent movies out of jealousy or something. There's no way so many people think this movie is garbage. If the good movies are really getting this many bad reviews, it's no wonder the quality of animated movies is going down. There's just no reason to try anymore......",False
5,10,Everyone that rated this below a 7 are why can't have nice things.,havenferrer,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOh my god. This has to be the most misunderstood Pixar film ever created.
I never realized how much hate this movie had gotten until now, but, reading through the reviews, it just isn't justified.
All of these are parents complaining about it being too intense for young children, but, this film isn't for them. I found that it reached out to a completely new audience, one that Pixar hasn't really touched upon recently, and that is pre-teens and teenagers that suffer from depression.
I am now 14 years old, and this film came out at just the right time for me, when things were taking a turn for the worst. I was going through depression and suicidal thoughts for reasons that I don't want to talk about, around the time in which this film was released. I hadn't seen a disney film in quite a long time, and my little sister really wanted to see this one.
Looking at all the generally positive feedback, I decided to go see it with her.
The opening sequence was possibly one of the best Pixar had done since Wall-E. It was beautiful and cinematic, and just adorable. Riley had some pretty gorgeous facial expressions and detailing for an animation standpoint.
As the film moved on, I started to realize how well this film related to my life, and how well riley related to me as a character. Pixar was very subtle with it, but, managed to develop Riley's character so well, with her barely being on screen.
The characters themselves were shockingly complex, especially sadness and joy. (Joy has a brilliant character design, with blue eyes and blue hair which we'll get to later.)
The main plot basically revolves around a pre-teen going into a state of depression after moving to her new home, away from her friends, her hockey team.
Depression, in my experience, isnt what it says it is. To me, it is a complete lack of any feeling whatsoever. When joy and sadness basically lose control of riley for awhile, this perfectly captured the ""what is going on inside their head"" meaning at the beginning of the film. Joy and sadness are the two most important emotions, and riley didnt have them anymore. A complete lack of emotion, a state of depression.
The rest of the film after that was enjoyable, and a certain character whom I was almost sure going to be a twist villain after that monstrosity that was 'Frozen', turned out to be my personal favorite character in the film. Everyone's had some sort of imaginative personality growing up. I had one.
It helped me cope with stress, I talked to it when I was mad about something, and whenever no one seemed to want to talk to me for whatever the reason, she was always there. That's why Bing Bong's death was just so hard to watch, because of how painfully true it is. I guarantee that 99% of the people on earth have completely forgotten about their imaginative friends growing up. The thing is, he didnt die, he was completely forgotten. When you think about it, it seems so much worse than dying. After that, joy seems to have forgotten about him as well. He isnt mentioned ever again in the movie, but, I'm kinda okay with that. If the movie forgets about him, the audience does as well, which creates an illusion.
Now, let's talk about the ending.
When riley returns home to her worried parents, she seems emotionless. Then I realized something, a slow realization that happened throughout the final scene in the film.
True happiness cannot exist without sadness.
This realization is depicted in one of the most brilliant forms ever, mixed emotions. As riley is growing up and maturing, mixed emotions become apart of her and her core memories. This symbolizes maturity and complexity as you grow up.
This film got me to open up to my parents about my depression and anxiety, and I feel like I have matured just like riley did in the film. Pixar did a brilliant job as depicting our emotions, personalities, and maturity. I love this film so much, and it changed my life.",True
6,10,Mandatory watch for children and parents alike.,Animany94,n/a,15/08/2025,"I did exactly what I was supposed to when watching this brilliant movie, I felt all the emotions at some point.Pixar did it again with Inside Out. For a long time I had stubbornly repeated that Toy Story would always be my favourite from Pixar, but I changed my mind shortly after watching this one.Like Toy Story you were offered a setup every adult can identify. Growing up learning how to control your feelings and learning the importance of every one of them. It is okay to be angry, sad, happy and afraid as long as we are taught how to manage them.The idea of having this control panel inside a human body has been done before by Osmosis Jones (2001), but let's say with much less success. Inside out takes it to the highest level of perfection.I loved the way Pixar made this world inside the main character of Riley, it is very creatively done and was in some ways just how I had imagined it. I must admit that I cried a couple of times during the movie, because it has some really touching moments.You should be feeling all emotions when watching Inside Out. It is a must watch.",False
7,10,A brilliant depiction of adolescence,Sweetigal85,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAs an adult, I love animated films but the trailers made this one look like it was really just for kids. I gave it a shot anyway and I didn't expect to love it--but it's depth absolutely shocked me. Not only is it a whimsical, funny film, but the poetry is off the charts.The creators of this film truly remember what it was like to be a child and continue to express understanding to children's feelings today. Riley is a light hearted little girl on the cusp of adolescence, approaching that turbulent age where everything changes and it seems like there is no one there to help you.Riley's emotions are portrayed using colorful creatures inside her head. Joy has been the ringleader of the emotions up until now, but Riley's life changes are starting to shake things up and Sadness has begun to take over. Truly amazing how this was depicted! Absolutely brilliant.As a kid, adults are often dismissing your emotions and never listening to you when you need them most. Often times kids cannot express themselves and turn to anger, panic or disgust, all emotions that will only heighten your problems as Riley comes to learn.When Joy finally lets Sadness take the reins and Riley opens up to her parents and they actually LISTEN to her...it is breathtaking.Don't miss out on this movie, definitely a must see! Amazing voice cast, beautiful visuals and a wonderful message to people of all ages.",True
8,n/a,The Older You Are the More You'll Like It,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Inside Out (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Eleven-year-old Riley has a wonderfully fun childhood thanks to the emotions working inside of her. Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) all help keep the young girl moving forward but when her family moves from Minnesota to San Fransisco it throws everyone for a loop and soon Joy and Sadness find themselves lost in her system and trying to find their way back.INSIDE OUT is certainly another winner from Pixar who are clearly the experts of the family movie. What really amazes me about the studio is that they're actually just making adult movies that kids happen to enjoy because of the pretty characters on the screen. I say this because films like this one, UP and WALL-E really do have adult stories dealing with adult issues yet somehow the studios are able to keep kids entertained while their parents get a lot more of the jokes and the emotions that the story provides. This one here is an incredibly touching story from a parent's point of view simply because of the changes that their kids go through.There's no doubt that the animation is the star of this picture and we're really treated to some wonderful images. I especially loved the use of colors in the picture and how various colors had a certain emotion attached to it. This is certainly excellent once our adventure begins as there's a ""long term memory"" section where these wonderful color marble like things are collection. Just the site of this are a true treat for the eyes. All of the ""emotion"" characters are perfectly brought to life with both Joy and Anger really standing out. The human characters are also quite entertaining and there's no doubt that the Bing Bong character will go down as a favorite decades from now.As I said, this film is going to work a lot better for older kids and adults as I'm sure the majority of young children aren't fully going to grasp the idea of emotions and how they effect our lives. The story itself is quite charming throughout and I was surprised at how many adult issues they were able to work on throughout the running time. Fans of Pixar are certainly going to love this as it's another winner that manages to work no matter what your age is. Still, I think the older you are the more you'll enjoy it.",False
9,6,Decently accurate depiction of part of the 3-ring sh-show we call life,trumpetnut-68406,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have mixed feelings about this film. On paper, it's pretty well thought-out and care was put into it. The animation was solid. This is probably a good movie for parents and kids. I don't know why they wrote the parents, especially the dad, to be so two-dimensional and forgettable. Riley was also pretty 2-D, but with the added emo side. Then again, she's a kid, and that's kinda how kids are at that age.For people planning to become parents, this is at least an honest depiction of a stage of development. I rarely hear any nuance about parenting from wanna-be grandparents pushing their kids to have kids. They just laugh at their kids after the fact, saying, ""Oh yeah, I remember those years of no sleep, cleaning poop, the screaming. Are they destroying everything and rejecting all food yet? Just wait a few more years, and they'll become all emo and hate you! Haha! Have fun with hair loss!""New parents will tell it like it is, though. Almost everybody I know who's had kids is somehow shocked by the difficulties of it all at first. Almost all of them have said to me, ""You'll never have a CLUE how difficult it is until you're a parent."" Verbatim. I always think to myself, ""How tf did you NOT know?"" We've all been going through the different stages of struggle throughout our lives, and continue to do so. Certainly they've also been hearing the struggles of parenthood from other parents.Life has a decent amount of suffering. We try, because we're here, and we're programmed to survive as long as possible. Along the way, we try to enjoy the ride amap and, with the exception of Boomers, try to help the younger generations.Anyway, this movie was not at all a surprise to me. It's just running out a slice of the three ring sh-show that is life. I could barely get through it, because life stages are so typical and frustrating to watch played out, but at the same time, it's just the way things are. I hope the movie helps some people.",False
10,10,Pixar's best film since Toy Story 3 and one of their finest overall,TheLittleSongbird,n/a,15/08/2025,"Most of Pixar's films are wonderful (short films too), and while the three films made after Toy Story 3 weren't up to their top standards they were still better than most animation companies at their worst. Inside Out was nothing short of a masterwork, Pixar's best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall.Pixar films can be relied upon to have great animation, and Inside Out certainly does have great animation. No, wonderful animation and some of the company's most ingeniously inventive, with gorgeously vibrant colours, a very imaginatively rendered setting (and the lands even more ingeniously done, the next land more so than the last), very meticulous and beautifully modelled backgrounds and clever character designs that match the emotions more than ideally. Michael Giacchino's sparkling, rousing and very charming score is one of my personal favourite scores of the year so far, and every bit as great as his score for Up.A superb job was done with the script here too, the comedy is clever and witty without ever being forced and balances subtly with the drama, the drama is some of the most truly poignant of any Pixar film and it doesn't ever feel manipulative or overdone and it's very smartly insightful. The story, not one of THE most innovative concepts but is one of the more imaginative uses of it and is quite original for Pixar actually, goes at a slightly steadier pace than other Disney films, but still captivated. It was very easy to completely connect with Riley and her situation and this was easily the Pixar film since Toy Story 3 that I connected with emotionally the most, also one of Pixar's most moving stories quite easily.Loved the characters too, Anger, Fear, Disgust and Bing Bong (the imaginary friend and the 'epitome of immaturity', without ever being annoying, his back story did bring a tear to the eye) stole every scene they were in, and even Sadness managed to crack some funny one-liners even in her depressive state. Joy also positively lights up the screen and Riley was easy to connect with and much more than just a stereotypical teen girl. The voice acting is splendid. Amy Poehler is note perfect as Joy with her spirited banter giving the character so much life while also bringing a human element to her as well, Lewis Black gives an explosively barn-storming turn as Anger, Phyllis Smith is amusing and affecting, Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling are similarly priceless and in a way that makes the characters of Fear and Disgust endearing rather than annoying, Richard Kind is innocently charming and Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane are appropriately compassionate.Overall, a masterful return to form for Pixar. It's their best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall as well. 10/10 Bethany Cox",False
11,6,An Interesting Concept with a Handful of Inconsistencies,SquigglyCrunch,n/a,15/08/2025,"Inside Out is the hit Disney-Pixar animated movie about emotions, specifically emotions living inside a person's brain in a somewhat human form and controlling how people react to things. It's an interesting concept, and for the most part it's presented well, but there are flaws for sure.The plot is, like I already said, interesting but flawed. It bothers me that people are saying that this is an incredibly original concept despite the fact that it's been done before. It's just the most popular use of the idea, but it's not the original. The story itself, however, has a handful of really good ideas, but there are inconsistencies with it too. The disappointing part is that most of the inconsistencies are actually pointless scenes that don't add to the story but instead end up taking away from it. There aren't a lot of them, but there's enough to take away from the movie itself. Most of the inconsistencies would spoil the movie, so you'll just have to watch it to understand. Other than that the ideas are good and some are even pretty amusing.The characters are okay. I found the most interesting characters to be the parents personally, with Riley being as flat as a pancake and everyone else just not being important enough to even remember by the time the credits roll. For a movie about emotion, Riley really isn't presented in a very realistic way. Sure, at times she's good, but most of the time her character is just inconsistent. The parents were, on the other hand, much more consistent, and funnier most of the time.I think that this movie had a great beginning and a great ending, it was just the middle stuff that struggled. It's a very emotionally intense movie, especially towards the end. I felt much more into the movie at these points, and even on my third watch I got a bit emotional about the ending. The movie felt a little too short as well, but maybe that's because I've seen it so many times already.Overall Inside Out is just good. I think that I loved it so much originally (I gave it a 10/10) because of the ending. It was pretty emotional the first time, but after the second watch I started to question it. By the third watch I found inconsistencies and a handful of things that I just didn't like about the movie. Ideas and such that just weren't nearly as good as I remember. In the end I'd still certainly recommend this movie, but if you want to really love it then don't analyze it, because otherwise you'll notice the things that I did (probably).",False
12,10,Beyond Words...,Heinzwill,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's been nearly a year since I first saw this film. I would say I had pretty low knowledge in films before I first saw Inside Out (not to say that I'm highly intelligent on films now). I only saw about 200 films prior. I hadn't seen a lot of classic films or even know that film can be an art form just through its camera work among other aspects. So you could say that I can't speak for everyone on my views of this film. And you may be right because opinions are subjective anyway.This is my favourite film ever.Like I said above, I didn't see a lot of films that were deemed as masterpieces at that time. While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.Yet this is still my favourite film of all-time.80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.Ever since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).Inside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.In the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.You can vote ""not helpful"" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway. This is a beautiful film that will resonate in me always.I will never forget Inside Out.",False
13,7,Great ride through emotions!,MuviFan73,n/a,15/08/2025,"Inside out is movie about emotions. Various emotions depicted in the movie are joy, fear, disgust, anger and sadness. The movie is about a girl who grows up to 11 years of age and then faces, what we can say, her first major mental breakdown resulting in a sad core memory formation. This happens because of the reason they move from Minnesota to a new place. The dull phase of her life is gradually overcome as the movie progresses as she learns to handle emotions more nicely.A human brain consists of various parts. It's fair to say that activity in certain part is responsible for a specific emotion. The movie has portrayed it very nicely. Human brain is very complicated structure. How it works majorly remains a mystery. The work done in the movie is a great representation of available information. The movie shows how a human being matures in terms of his emotions. Its shown how the girl learns to handle multiple emotions in terms of memory.My personal favorite emotions(characters) go in order anger, fear, joy, disgust, and sadness. Anger being the most liked one. The movie is wonderful, great job done by creators. Fairly recommended.",False
14,10,How?,acohen090,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wtf people. I was just reading like several one reviews and how do people get a movie so wrong?! It should be pg-13? It's not for children? Are these people out of there freaking mind? For all of you who feel that it's not for children, take a look again.You severely underestimate of how much emotion a child can handle and you would be suprised. The 1 star reviews are almost laughable about how inaccurate they are. These people should be locked up in a jail for attempting to stop bringing this movie to the world. I absolutely love Inside Out, it was one of my favorite movies of 2015, and I hope you 1 Star people live your lives full of misery.",False
15,n/a,Not for young children,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I confess that I had to watch this twice before I could properly assess it. It's definitely not a young children's film, as there's precious little to entertain them, but it does have much to consider for older children and (young) adults. As a rumination on what drives us all through life, this is very effective, but I do feel that the story lacks something for making Riley so isolated in her world. Perhaps if she interacted a bit more in the story, this would be a more involving film, but the reflections on lost innocence do add some poignancy and lift this film slightly above average.",False
16,10,"Amazing movie- Those who bash it because it is not a kid's movie, please stop",Aang1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've noticed a plethora of negative reviews all saying the same thing- their kids did not enjoy/ understand the movie and it was too dark. Yet they also say that the movie was well made and had an excellent concept. My question to these people is this- If you wanted to see a happy meaningless movie with adult toilet humour, why didn't you take your kids to see Minions? Inside out is for those who like quality cinema, to be entertained as well as taught challenging concepts. It is an artistic film. Why do you people always have to assume that all animated films have to be for kids and filled with stupid toilet humour? This is Pixar we are talking about, those who have created Wall-E and Up. Review this movie on its own merits, rather than be biased in your judgement that the film was too dark and confusing for kids. It was never marketed as a film for toddlers and little kids. I went with my brother who is in high school and it was one of the best experiences we had in the cinema in a very long time. Kudos to Pixar; it was truly an amazing, advanced conceptual, artistic film.",False
17,10,Tears of Joy,OliverGinger,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before I start, I will say this; I'm writing this after coming back from a second viewing of Inside Out. Both viewings were out of choice. That's not a unique thing, but I very rarely watch films more than once at the cinema, mainly because life is short, or rather, life is too quick for me. But there's two main reasons why people watch some films more than once at the cinema, especially where I come from; either the film was interesting, detailed, or multi-layered and needs to be seen again to sink in properly, or, it was really, really good.In this case, for me, it's the latter. That's not to say that the film isn't interesting, detailed or multi-layered, but the reason that was repeating in my head to see it again was 'it's really, really good.' But is it? Yes, yes of course it is... Speaking with a bunch of friends with whom I saw it the first time, a risky phrase was unanimously agreed upon, which was that we 'trust the Pixar team to do the right thing.' Needless (totally needless) to say that expectations were high, and frankly, they were surpassed.Even though the film is what we come to expect from Pixar (the universal moral themes, the perfect balance between comedy and sadness, and visually stunning animation and action sequences), I didn't feel that I had seen it all before, and neither was it repetitive nor 'ordinary'. The film hits all the high notes, with perfect intonation, and with discipline and passion. As touched on before, the balance between humour and sadness is strong and impressive; the amount of emotions that the film displays and takes us through is varied and immersive, yet not overwhelming. The film executes such clever ideas with simplicity and ease, leaving us to feel for the characters rather than worry about the 'science' of it all, or even being worried about 'not getting it'.The animation is constantly eye-drawing and detailed; the characters' glistening skin is particularly wondrous. And what great characters they are. Riley is brilliantly sympathetic throughout, even with her difficult mood swings, and the supporting characters are perfectly entertaining. One might think that the superficial nature of the characters (Anger is angry, Fear is always scared etc.) would become old quickly, however the fun never diminishes, thanks to a witty script, expressive animation, and very strong voice performances from the entire cast.However, to top all this off, the real gem comes from the character of Joy, surely a strong contender in the list of Pixar's greatest characters. Even though we are inside the head of Riley for the majority of the film, and the events that drive the movie are essentially her reactions to her new world (moving from Minnesota to San Francisco), the story is Joy's. Being probably the most flawed character in the film (paradoxically, maybe), it's her journey we care about the most, and she ends up being the most in-depth character in the film, occasionally questioning her actions in the first half (well, the cynics will be), and becoming the most sympathetic by the end. Amy Poehler's outstanding performance makes Joy simultaneously the strongest and weakest character in the film (emotionally, that is).After all of this, the freshness of the ideas, the simplified neuroscience, the technical brilliance (saying that, Giacchino's score is probably the most subtle thing in the film, exquisitely putting the finishing touches on the most emotional scenes), fleshed out characters and universal themes, all of this comes together simply to entertain us, to let us escape, and to release us emotionally, which it does by making us laugh and cry in an even and fair manner.And you will laugh. And you will cry. And it is fun to do so. Thank god we're living in a time when Pixar is making these films.",False
18,9,9/10,Giacomo_De_Bello,n/a,15/08/2025,"94 minutes of pure joy and emotion. A return to masterclass from pixar and not only that, probably their best work outside of Toy Story 1 and 2. This film does deserves every bit of praise it has got and more. I will say without hesitation that if you haven't seen this film, believe me you should.Lets just start easy by saying that the animation is something other-wordily. We are beyond the point where anyone needs to express the fact that pixar's animation is gorgeous, but the fact is this animation is some of the most intelligent and dense animation I have ever seen. There are easter eggs in every single frame and more than that every visual element in the movie is well rounded and clearly thought out which makes the storytelling so much more gripping. Talking about storytelling, rarely does a film do visual storytelling so brilliantly. Five minutes into the movie I was in and I knew how things were rolling. This s really a lesson on how to think things out visually and how to use visuals to your advantage as much as it is possible, combining them to smart, engaging ideas.And now to the layers the film has. The deepness of its themes, the intelligence of its story, the subtext behind every action and word, the comedic touches, the insanely funny pop culture references, the poetic approach to joy and sadness, the emotional depth, everything, I'm telling you everything here is gut wrenching. There isn't one scene where you feel time is being wasted, there isn't one word a character speaks that doesn't feel genuine, there isn't one idea that is boring or unoriginal. This film is beyond emotionally engaging, this film gives you a mirror on which to reflect your life and think about it, but no wait it doesn't stop there, it also gives you the opportunity to laugh about it, that no matter what is going on there is also space for a laugh and for lightness. Wow.After a second viewing I have settled on the problem I originally had and can now honestly say this film really just has nitpick issues, it's truly a great one and definitely the best we've been given in 2015 so far. After my first viewing I was all enthusiastic about everything above, but I also was left a little confused by the mythology the film uses and wasn't quite sure it always fit. Upon a second viewing I guarantee that there is no such problem. The mythology is perfect and works with a solid and thought out logic that takes into account the chaos of life. What doesn't quite work is the fact that the film does have a few really minor shortcuts or conveniences that may stick out and I honestly wanted a little bit more of the control center room scenes and see some more of how it worked there, but then again I am really nitpicking.Incredible for me to say it, but I really want a sequel to this film, it's incredible. I want to see another two hours of the five emotions battling in out in the life of Riley and her further struggles, especially want to see the teenage years. This idea is truly amazing and special and it is so inspiring to me, I just really want a sequel to this film and that's the first time I've ever said that in my life.Trust me this film deserves every single bit of your attention and heart, it will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions and entertainment that is absolutely delightful and will also leave you thinking for days.",False
19,7,Didn't live up to my expectations,alexwebb32,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had high expectations for this movie, and I was quite disappointed when I finished it. I really hope Pixar does better next time, because this is not good enough.The people who gave it an 8, 9 or 10 out of 10 need to calm down though, and so do the people who gave it a 1, 2 or 3. It's definitely not amazing, but it's definitely not ""the worst"" either. Those who say it's one of the two are exaggerating.Personally, I think it's mediocre. It has some fun, interesting elements to it, and the concept is original. It starts out quite interesting, the beginning is the best part, but the rest is not as good. It relies heavily on clichés, and none of the characters feel original. None of them develop much either, not even the main character, they're predictable and quite boring. Actually, you don't really get to know them, not even Riley, which is pretty ridiculous considering the movie is set inside her head. The parts that are supposed to make you laugh only make you smile awkwardly, because they're so cliché. There is no ""wow factor"", and the ending was predictable. Definitely not what I would expect from Pixar.I wouldn't recommend or discourage people from watching it though, as some may enjoy it, but people probably shouldn't get their hopes up.",False
20,10,Best Pixar Since Toy Story,matthewssilverhammer,n/a,15/08/2025,"After some ho-hum years and too many sequels, Pixar is back and better than ever with Inside Out, a boldly unique animated film that renews our faith in what a giant studio can do with an original concept. Docter combines the strengths of his two Pixar masterworks here: the endless inventiveness of Monster's Inc. and the poignant strength of Up. A truly fantastic mixture of fantasy-adventure-comedy and small-family-drama, it's a genius work of conception, execution and emotion that will go down in the annals of Disney animation as an instant and enduring classic. It follows Joy, the leading-emotion of an 11-year-old girl, as she tries to navigate a big change in her young life. Much like Toy Story 3, we're shown the inherent difficulties of growing up through a fresh viewpoint, learning what makes you ""you"". It's a convoluted idea that's nearly impossible to explain, and yet Pixar nails it, perfectly shifting between its parallel universes with ease. The humor throughout will undoubtedly have kids and adults in equal stitches, with fantastic turns from everyone, notably Poehler, Smith, Black, and Kind. However, this film's high-point may be the multiple emotional gut-punches that will reduce parents to tears. That fearlessness to be gloomy is basically the thesis of the film: true joy comes when every emotion is allowed to be recognized and dealt with healthfully. It's quite a psychologically complex stance to take for a film that manages to be so kid-friendly. This wonderful balancing act helps make Inside Out worthy of the ""M"" word (masterpiece) and gives it the distinction of being Pixar's best since the unparalleled Toy Story.",False

22,9,Absolutely Brilliant!,crimson_knight_7,n/a,15/08/2025,"For every child, growing up can be exciting, confusing, and difficult. For Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco, Riley is directed by her emotions, Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) in Headquarters Control Center inside Riley's mind to help her overcome everyday life. However, Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to Riley's new life in San Francisco and emotional disorder arises. Although Joy, Riley's main and most fundamental emotion, tries to keep things optimistic, the emotions fight on how best to navigate Riley's new world.After watching ""Inside Out"" with my wife, we both agreed that ""Inside Out"" is the perfect Pixar Animation movie for any family on a night out. It was both imaginative and relatable for both children and adults. I never thought ""Inside Out"" would be this enjoyable, but I was able to experience every emotion of ""Joy"", ""Disgust"", ""Anger"", ""Fear"", and ""Sadness"" for each and every moment of this film. At the end of the night, I was pleasantly unsatisfied because I wanted to watch the movie again and again. Parents, if you're looking for a fun filled movie night with your children, this movie will not only please them, but you as well.A Definite 9!! Well done Pixar!",False
23,6,NOT a return to 'form',natashabowiepinky,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMaybe I just don't get it. Perhaps there's something intrinsic to the the whole experience I require clarifying on. Somewhere, there might be an obscure reason I don't feel as passionately about this film as others have.Or maybe, JUST maybe...Inside Out is overrated.I mean, yea... The animation is excellent. But this is PIXAR we're talking about here... Not Hanna Barbera, circa 1970's. It kinda comes with the territory. And yes, the concept is very clever... But then again, it reminds me of an old comic strip I used to read called 'The Numbskulls' about small men controlling an average human's body. Then of course, there was the film Osmosis Jones, which regarded the adventures of the tiny people who were involved in the day-to-day running of Bill Murray. Not one of his funniest roles, BTW.But something is definitely missing here. I found sections of the film a bit dull, none of the attempts at humour really made me laugh, and that pink elephant 'imaginary friend' was almost as obnoxious as Olaf the snowman. The part where I suppose we were meant to feel sad, as he was abandoned to fade away with the rest of the Riley's memories, just made me think 'about ruddy time'. What else was he supposed to do... Live, and cause a pre-teen to go through years of enforced therapy?There wasn't enough going on in the human world, either...There was no real bond, with Riley, our lead character and the viewer... She felt more like a robot programmed by her five emotions than a living, breathing person. Her parents were as stereotypical and plastic as they come, and no other person has enough interaction with Riley for us to empathise with them... Or her, for that matter.So, what it all boils down to is the quintet of emotions who live in her head and apparently call the shots there. Of them, Anger, Disgust and Fear and the most interesting, but guess what? They're the ones who get the shortest thrift in the script, and end up (for the most part) stuck in the 'control room' while Joy and Sadness go on the main quest. Joy's eternal perkiness is irritating, and Sadness is just a walking doormat. Not the pair I would have chosen for the lion's share of the movie to follow... And the film suffers because of this.A lot of critics praise the authenticity of the memories Riley has and how it reminds them of their own children and lost youth... REALLY?! In that case, there must be a lot of reviewers out there who live in unbearably corny Life Insurance commercials, full of stock images and manufactured familiar situations. Watching the sun go down? First day at school? Eating broccoli?! Do me a favour.Plus, some of them seem a bit unlikely... In one flashback, Riley misses the big shot in a hockey game, and hands the championship to the rival side. What do the rest of her team do? Why, put her on their shoulders and throw her up in the air repeatedly!! In the cutthroat world of American competitive sport, I HIGHLY doubt it. Or perhaps they just like being Losers. Hmm...I did actually enjoy the film, so you might think I'm being a tad harsh. But bear in mind this is PIXAR we're talking about here... Who's every feature was virtually a masterpiece. After a string of underwhelming flicks, though (Brave, Cars 2, Monsters University, and now this) perhaps it's about time I stopped treating them as the purveyors of miracles, and think of the company as a normal studio who pumps out spectacularly animated but somewhat shallow productions. Just like Dreamworks.What a shame. 6/10",True
24,1,"""Best idea Pixar ever had...?""",CarmellaSoprano,n/a,15/08/2025,"Vanity Faire said this was ""the best idea Pixar ever had""...I liked it better TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO when it was a sitcom called ""Herman's Head"".This ran on the FOX network 1991-94, and included ""Simpsons"" voice actors Yeardley Smith and Hank Azaria, and starred William Ragsdale. Sorry if this is dull but I have to write ""ten lines of text"" to qualify as having an opinion on IMDb. I didn't really see anything in ""Inside Out"" that was not previously explored in ""Herman's Head"", perhaps it is just because I was a fan of the earlier show that this blatant rip off was so disappointing to me.",False
25,9,An artistic triumph,mohan59,n/a,15/08/2025,"For some reason, I couldn't quite catch this movie in theaters and I managed to watch it on an international flight. And boy, am I glad I did!As far as concepts go, I was astonished at the amount of detail and coherence in execution. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the colors rich and vibrant, the characters utterly memorable and some of the most poignantly heart-breaking lines of dialogue ever spoken/sung in any movie, let alone feature animation. It is every bit a Disney-Pixar classic and as emphatic a return to form as it can get.The story revolves around a young girl child who is happy in her world and has to suddenly acclimatize to another environment when her family has to move. Growing pains and social issues affect her while she grapples with increasingly complex situations, both at home and school. Meanwhile, the interplay between the five primary emotions inside her mind is both dynamic and fraught with compromises, much like how we deal with others everyday. As things come to a head and young Riley is about to make a life-changing decision, the events that follow leave a lasting impression, with an increased appreciation of the phrase ""emotions are what makes us human""!I recognized some dichotomies - for instance, Minnesota, usually perceived cold, is regarded as warm and comforting by Riley while San Francisco, renowned for its sunny weather, is seen as foreign and unwelcome. The other contrast I noticed was all five emotional figures (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust) do not always stay true to form, with Joy especially exhibiting nuances far beyond what her name implies - case in point, her touching admission preceding the last act (that entire sequence was too much for my eyes to take, by the way). All this might be considered a tad too much for young children to appreciate, but with time, they may probably realize how beautifully honest this movie was in trying to portray their growth and the underlying issues.Certainly, it is not without flaws: the plot meandered a bit 2/3rds into the length; Joy's ""A-ha"" moment seems strangely contrived, despite the impact it had; the music was adequate but not truly captivating as in the case of other Pixar offerings. But the beauty of this medium is that it offers filmmakers opportunities to steer audiences to more engaging experiences; Pete Docter and Co accomplish this with aplomb.In terms of cast and crew, the voice actors are superb selections - Lewis Black aces the Angry persona with generous dollops of sarcasm; Mindy Kaling is just perfect voicing Disgust; Richard Kind's performance as the imaginary Bing Bong is an absolute tear-jerker, while Kaitlyn Dias shows remarkable poise playing Riley. But it is Amy Poehler who steals the show in a coruscating blend of vivacity, vibrancy, and vicariousness. Her Joy is not an infallible leader, but one who accepts others in the face of challenging situations and plows ahead with inspiring positive energy. The animation left me spell-bound, especially the sequence where thoughts are shown to be abstracted, and are endowed with a lot of heart. The movie is fairly short, but a running time of 94 minutes is appropriate justice to a slightly heavy subject matter. The humor compensates with trademark Pixar staple of jokes, albeit intended for slightly more mature viewers. Pete Docter gave us the outstanding Up six years ago and ably accompanied by Ronnie del Carmen, has categorically demonstrated that he is a fabulous storyteller and a master entertainer.Inside Out is every bit a Pixar fan's well-deserved reward for patience. Do yourself a favor and watch this magnificent gem.",False

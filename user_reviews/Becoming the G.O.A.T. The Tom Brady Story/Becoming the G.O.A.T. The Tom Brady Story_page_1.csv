1,1,Seriously poor,cykhjxp,n/a,15/08/2025,"Could have done a better job shooting this documentary on my iphone and inserting YouTube clips. Poor interviews, lacks anything meaningful and a complete waste of an hour.",False
2,2,What a joke,cartercoe,n/a,15/08/2025,This is the worst sports documentary I've ever seen. No live footage from college or the NFL. No interviews of Tom or anyone else particularly close to him. Waste of time.,False
3,1,An English language German documentary about tom Brady's acquaintances,pooz_the_gun,n/a,15/08/2025,"First thing that I've learned from this documentary. If you don't have the budget to do an acceptable job don't tell the story. Except for Charlie Weis there's nobody of any importance in this documentary. Thebmovie doesn't have the rights for any game footage. The movie doesn't tell a coherent story. It's just interview snippets of oddly many German guys that barely or not at all know Brady sprinkled pictures, bad animation and rumors.For any football fan outside Germany. Avoid this mess. For a football fan from Germany, you too unless you wanna hear the difference between a German and american accent.",False
4,1,Don't Do It!,saylorshane,n/a,15/08/2025,"No production value
No licensed music
No licensed footage
No Brady interview
Laughable at times, it's so cheesy. It is entertaining if you start judging how bad it is for fun, like a B movie.",False
5,1,If I could give it a ZERO I would,johnlm-845-993492,n/a,15/08/2025,"Too much talk, virtually no live clips. I can't believe Brady would approve this. Boring at best. Don't waste your money. With the history of Tom Brady, this could have been awesome, but it failed terribly.",False
6,2,The documentary definitely not G.O.A.T material.,dhr-74068,n/a,15/08/2025,This seems like someone trying to get their big break in producing a documentary by being cheap.They can't even use real footage from the games he played in and definitely couldn't find many people for the documentary. This is truly an embarrassment to the G. O. A. T himself.,False
7,1,Stock footage of fake football players,parkybk-79433,n/a,15/08/2025,"Seriously, Brady's been in the league over two decades, and the best you could come up with is stock footage of fake football players in generic non-NFL teams?!? Obviously not an authorized film, no royalties or permissions given here. Booooring interviews that anyone who has read a Wikipedia page on Brady could write. This felt like an outsider's attempt to look behind the curtain, and they failed miserably; the viewer is still left on the outside. The production quality is terrible, silly, pacing is too slow, the music is weird and never changes through the movie regardless of the topic. Just an all-around train wreck of a movie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",False
8,10,i moaned,oxaguirre,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie was so hotttttttt. üçÜüçëüí¶.The mens stunning pecs was so goof
when tom brady came out so did i
tom brady is the ,ost mjestic looking man
i cant contain myself when he comes on screen.I absolutely LOVE my Goaty-Woaty, he is such a precious little ray of sunshine (I want him to spit on me)
The amount of pleasure and joy I feel when Brady-Wady enters the shot, the amount of ecstasy that filled my little femboy veins, was so large I had to have a lie down after watching the film.GOD, even thinking about the Bradester makes my head go all dizzy and faint.I want nothing more than Tommy-Wommy to stroke me till I have a stroke.",True
9,1,Wrong identification of footage,dsbjbrown,n/a,15/08/2025,"Seriously? They used footage of Grand Rapids and identified it as Brighton. If they can't get something that small correct, why would you believe anything else?I watched the 80 for Brady movie and this came up as ""you might be interested in"" on YouTube. The 80 for Brady movie was great to watch, with real footage of Brady playing, but this doesn't have any value as far as a documented backstory. It makes you wonder if the makers of this documentary were desperate since the only people they interviewed were his high school coaches.I'm glad I only wasted 15 minutes attempting to learn more about the background of Tom Brady before the error tipped me off that this was not a good product.",False
10,2,The extra in ordinary,tdube-01649,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's like watching a mockumentary about all the people who think they matter to Tom Brady. I made it about 25 minutes, for most people it won't take that long, but I admit I was fascinated so watched more than necessary.Somehow every clip, interview, or line of dialogue is impressively boring. Clips of baseball, Brady's school lunch menu, plus a revelation that 6'4 is taller than the average human. They explained hard work is necessary to make it in the NFL. Twice. The last pearl I recall was someone using the phrase ""sprinkler-gate"", followed by laughter that was more hard work than was honest.This documentary examines an extraordinary athlete's achievements beyond anything in the history of the NFL. It does this with mundane anecdotes that are generic, yet surgically consistent so everything almost sounds inspiring. It's the kind of presentation from people being incredibly lazy or incredibly terrified of Tom Brady.",False

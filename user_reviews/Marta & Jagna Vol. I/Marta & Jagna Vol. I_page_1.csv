1,9,"A universal tale of love, sacrifice, and unwavering support.",leakhamraev,n/a,15/08/2025,"From the very first frame, ""Marta & Jagna"" beckons viewers into a world where the ties of love are as unyielding as they are profound. At its core, this documentary isn't merely about the relentless world of gymnastics; it's a heartfelt exploration of the undying bond between a mother and daughter that resonates with authenticity and warmth.Marta and Jagna emerge not just as subjects but as symbols of resilience, hope, and unbreakable familial love. Their relationship serves as the beating heart of the film, pulsating with emotion and authenticity. The care with which their story is crafted is palpable, drawing viewers into their world with an intimacy that feels both raw and tender.The film's strength lies in its simplicity. There's no need for elaborate narratives or dramatic twists when the essence of the story-the bond between Marta & Jagna-is so compellingly genuine. As the narrative unfolds, audiences are treated to moments of joy, pain, triumph, and vulnerability. Each scene is imbued with a sense of authenticity, allowing viewers to experience the highs and lows of their journey firsthand.What sets this film apart, in my humble opinion, is its ability to capture the nuances of the mother-daughter relationship within the competitive realm of gymnastics. While the backdrop may be a world of flips, tumbles, and rigorous training, the film never loses sight of its core theme: family. The dynamics between Marta and Jagna transcend the sport, offering a universal tale of love, sacrifice, and unwavering support.For me, ""Marta & Jagna"" is more than just a documentary-it's a heartfelt tribute to the enduring power of familial love. It's a poignant, touching, and ultimately uplifting journey that I believe will resonate with audiences long after viewing, encapsulating the very essence of the family bond with grace and authenticity.",False
2,10,Lovely documentary with lovable people,Jackthehammer19821111,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a sweet, sweet documentary and i might add, will bring you some good tears towards the end. A story of pure love and dedication. The story is quite simple and bare of any excesses, as we are presented mostly with daily gym life of the gymnast couple and toddler daughter, Jagna. It's through this ""pov"", that you are presented to the beat heart love story that the film captures tenderly. I've also enjoyed that we are not presented with gymnastics events, instead, all focus is on the pre-work, which itself is a labour of love and dedication.. I've loved it, and I would definitely recommend the view if you allow yourself to read subtitles. I wonder when Vol. II will come out? ðŸ˜€",False

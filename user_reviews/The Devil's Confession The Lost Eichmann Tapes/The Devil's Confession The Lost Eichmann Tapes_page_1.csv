1,10,Finally!,wdap-55098,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThey have finally made a documentary with the actual Sassen interviews! And well worth the wait. Great doc- IMHO- it puts to rest the ""banality of evil"" from Hannah Arendt. Eichmann was a hardcore believer and much less a paper pusher. You hear his actual voice on tape stating ""I regret nothing""- very gripping film! And you get Saskia Sassen recounting the night Eichmanns' two older sons burst into the Sassen house and accuse Willem of giving up their father. They make deep suggestions on the formation of Israel and their nuclear program. I watched it three times in one weekend. The best documentary since Chernobyl.",True

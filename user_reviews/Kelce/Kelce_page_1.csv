1,9,Watch This Doc,webefriendsshow,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredibly well shot and edited with a storyline much bigger than football. This is really about the questions of what it means to be a family, what it means to be a man, and how we value what we do with the tiny amount of time we're given - whether that's in our career or in our entire life.I already liked the Kelce's from their public personas, but this really deepened that respect. Jason really opened his life up to scrutiny and we're the better for it.Kudos to the filmmakers for editing what must've been a herculean amount of footage into such a positive and moving portrait of the entire Kelce clan and beyond.",False
2,9,"Must see, even if you are not an Eagles fan!",niki_anastasio,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent documentary about an amazing football player; Jason Kelce of the Philadelphia Eagles. What a year to capture such a journey that culminated with brother versus brother, as the Philadelphia Eagles went up against the Kansas City Chiefs. The Eagles had an amazing season from day 1, hit a bump, but still made it right to the end, Super Bowl 57! There is lots of Jason Kelce, Travis Kelce and momma Kelce. The family dynamic was an angle you don't often hear anything about, which really added depth to this documentary. So much emotion, and insight into a player, his family and the legacy that is the Philly Eagles.",False
3,8,A very good documentary on these two bro's!,dfloro,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs someone who is not the biggest fan of pro football (or any pro sports, really), boy was I surprised at how good this movie was! The 2022 season was an extremely notable one for the Philadelphia Eagles, as they went undefeated for well over half of the regular season before finishing 14-3 and clinching the conference Championship. It was star center Jason Kelce's 12th season and had him seriously considering retirement from the game. My personal opinion is that if he'd beaten his younger brother Travis and the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII, he would've retired right on the mountaintop. But he lost (on a controversial defensive holding call that set up a game-winning/ending field goal!). So, despite everything (his beaten-up body, the birth of his third daughter, the wild unexpected success of his and Travis' podcast, etc.), he chose to return for the Eagles' 2023 season. To watch him as he struggles mightily with that decision right up until the NFL trade deadline (""... but where am I gonna get that feeling...?"") is surprisingly moving-heart wrenching, really. It's inarguably fun to watch the incredible mind connection tight-end Travis has with his MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes, but for me it's more impressive still to see Jason's exemplary behavior toward and beautiful love for his wife and children. He's a Very Important Person, not just a valuable player for his team. A 8/10 film!",True
4,10,Yep. Watch it,sharliep,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm sure everyone else has said all this before me. Such a well made film with some of the best high quality footage I've seen in a while.I'm a Chiefs fan who started watching the New Heights podcast on YouTube when it came out and continue to. It's so easy to respect Jason just as much as chiefs fans respect Travis. His wife is an incredibly down to earth and I really enjoyed how their family dynamic was portrayed throughout the documentary. I was also shocked to find out that his family had to pay for Super Bowl seats - I figured that was a perk!Final thoughts - if you don't at least tear up when Jason finds his mom after the Super Bowl and cries, are you even human?",False
5,10,One of the best sports films I've ever seen!,reffitt-78072,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is hands down one of, if not the best, sports films I have ever seen. The insane behind the scene's look into Jason Kelce's life as an all-pro NFL center, father and husband, brother, son, and teammate is unrivaled in ""Kelce."" A glimpse into life as one of the best centers in NFL history is a true rollar coaster of emotion. I laughed out loud, felt true empathy for complete strangers, and wiped tears from my eyes throughout the film. Very few films can carry such a heavy emotional burden on the viewer. If you want to know what a professional athlete playing at the highest level goes through during the biggest of seasons, look no further than Kelce! I promise you will not regret it!",False
6,10,Beautiful,Willco23,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love that the Kelce family allowed us to see into their home and experience their beautiful family. He and his daughters had me smiling and laughing throughout. Not only that, but for Jason to be vulnerable with his emotions and not be afraid to show his physical and mental hardships, really makes this a must watch, in my opinion.As far as the production goes, it was put together masterfully with top notch footage. It's a must see for football fans and even for those who don't know much about the game.For those with younger children, just know there is a lot of swearing. It's real life and football so that may be expected. I for one am glad they didn't bleep anything out to keep it organic.",False
7,10,A Movie any Birds fan will LOVE!,brooksrob1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI had no idea this movie was made, it just showed up in my new films on Amazon.Seeing the early years of Jason and his brother was very poignant.We, the Birds, are 2-0 and Kelce is his normal steady self at center, So the spoiler is; He decides to play for the 2023 season.I didn't know how on the fence he actually was. It's concerning to see how these apex athletes, must endure SEVERE all over body aches and pains. When you think about all the players dealing with similar issues throughout the league, it makes you understand their sacrifices. Primarily their health.No amount of money can ever compensate you for that pain. Jason is a warrior, a modern day gladiator...As a Birds fan for a bit more than half a century, I'm proud to have experienced his whole career and was never more proud of the city and the team when they won the superbowl... A great movie to watch and if you're a Birds fan, you'll be bursting with pride!",True
8,10,Love it! And I am not even a football fan,elzames,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved the story, the struggles, the love and the dynamic between two brothers.You see how a incredible man Jason is and what he does for his family.His wife kylie is fantastic! Being cool and calm with a husband who plays football and their beautiful children.You see what kind of pressure football is and the media with it. The struggle finding a focus with all the media.How they started a podcast insecurely and made a succes out of it.At the and of the documentary honestly i don't know if i want him to keep playing because he is amazing or retire and doesn't get hurt and play with his beautiful children.Wish you Kelce family the best in the entire world!",False
9,10,Wow. Watch it!,maeveraak,n/a,16/08/2025,"To watch the inner struggle with retirement was incredibly moving. The whole movie was moving. Jason might not have won the Super Bowl this year, but he sure has won at life. He's got parents and in-laws supporting him, not to mention a gorgeous, straight forward, funny and compassionate wife to come home to with three show stealing little girls. My favorite part was watching his 9-month pregnant wife sitting in her toddler tornado affected hotel room with her dad while doing her own hair and makeup getting ready for the Super Bowl ... as a mom of 3 it was very relatable. I also loved the fact that their house isn't professionally cleaned. It's lived in and real life, not some instaworthy creation to create a perception of perfection. Kelce family, can we be friends?? After this, I'm just as big of fans of you as I am the Birds!",False
10,1,I love them but...,susansundaisy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm in Philly. I'm from here. Go birds. I have 3 underdog t shirts and I like the podcast with the brothers. But following the eagles, underdog and New Heights podcast on Instagram plus the advertising on Prime for the documentary plus watching the eagles and going to the home opener, I feel all Kelced out, if you know what I mean.I can't believe I'm saying this but I had to turn it off after 20 minutes because it's really hard to watch someone talk about how great they are and then other people say yeah he's really great and then they tell you he's a really great dad and a really great guy and a really great business man and you're like enough already.Plus, we already know that he came back because the season started two weeks ago. So there's really no drama and Kelse every year acts like he might not come back and then he does.Now I'm starting to worry that he's just an incredible ego maniac because why would you need a documentary about yourself before you even retire? And furthermore, I am not sad at all for Jason Kelse or his brother because they have both lived the lives you can only dream of and that they've always wanted.Eventually you have to stop playing sports professionally. Now Travis and Jason are putting it out there that Travis might be dating Taylor Swift and I'm like what do two guys that have $40 million each really need to do all this for?I can't believe I feel this way but I do.Go birds.",False
11,10,Wow!,apmxvyrx,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm an Eagles fan so I already liked the guy but after watching his documentary, I don't see how anyone can't like him.The film is shot and edited beautifully. The interaction between the Kielce brothers is A+ brotherly love. Kelce's wife and kids are scene stealers. Yes, there is a lot of football in the film but it fits so well with side stories.Kelce and his wife display such a great relationship with all of her support behind him. A lot of the film deals with when does he retire knowing that's going to be difficult but the worry about CTE and his current pain are all in play. Highly recommend the film.",False
12,10,Loved it because I lived it in the 90's,mcm-99147,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm so happy there is a documentary about offensive lineman, especially the most unappreciated - the center. I will always believe the most physical player on the field.I completely relate to this movie, especially during the interviews with his wife, Kylie. I was the wife of a pro center, we were high school sweethearts, but he began to suffer with CTE symptoms in college. (He was drafted in 1992 - long before concussion protocol.)
We have been divorced for 15 years. I couldn't take the changes in him - the extreme violence that came from a former gentle giant.Congrats on your retirement!",False
13,10,Triumphs and Tears,buckwinthrop-16041,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this documentary. It gives all the action and all the feels of behind the scenes of the NFL and a family. In a world of dark bad news its absolutely intoxicating to watch these amazing people interact, live, love and ponder their futures. Kylie Kelce is the standout. A natural raving beauty she is a pillar of strength and balance in this rough and tumble world. Its heartbreaking and exciting at the same time. Both Jason and Travis need to get out and retire on top of the game while they're in one piece. Jason, god help him is a broken man. Its obvious in every scene. I hope this is the last season.",False
14,10,Great Inside Look at an Athlete's Balance of Family and Football,joybryant-40840,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was a heartwarming look at the Kielce brothers' families, their history, and their lives as professional football players. It was a very human approach showing them in everyday lives without the glamor, including struggles. It was sad to see the constant pain the players face, especially as they get older. Jason Kelce's wife, Kylie, is such a hoot and his girls are adorable. This really shows their close brotherhood as well as the unwavering support from the Kelce parents as the boys grew up. I'm not much of a sports enthusiast; yet I really enjoyed learning about the Kelce brothers.",False
15,10,Amazing!,melissalynn-73411,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched it...loved it! Not even an Eagles fan (sorry patriots fan here). This documentary was amazing from start to end. Not even just the sport aspect, but the home life and the realness was wonderful. Jason is such a wonderful dad and Kylie is an amazing woman and I really appreciate the fact that their house wasn't spotless and showed how a house looks when a family actually lives there. It makes us non NFL moms feel better about our lives. They should honestly have a reality show together...I'm sure everyone would watch. Wishing their family the best! Thank you for making the documentary and for bringing this into our lives!",False
16,9,Kelce Review,sophiaswift-05523,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI Just love to know more about the kelce family, like A their story and how they became important in the NFL as professional players. The super bowl with Travis and Jason It's very good and there is an expectation about which brother would win the super bowl and the family is kind of divided about it, It was Very emotional moment see both of tem together there and the Jason's journey of knowing whether or not he should stop with the NFL, the ending is very beautiful, I wish it was a documentary series focusing more on the whole family, i also love the family and wish had like a keeping UP with the kelce's , i would love to wacht that. Is one of My favorite sports documentaries.",True
17,8,Solid Documentary,ThereelscoopwithKK,n/a,16/08/2025,"Overall I quite enjoyed this look into the life of Jason Kelce and his family. The good part about it is that it didn't simply narrow in on one area. Instead it did a really good job of showing how each area of his life impacts his life and others. While it acknowledges that these athletes are paid very well, it displays some of the costs and the future unknown costs these athletes pay for what they do to their bodies. Overall Jason seems like everything anyone who's followed him would expect; a jolly happy go lucky man who loves life. Of course you never know exactly how things are when the cameras are off with this kind of filming but overall it feels pretty genuine.As a Dallas Cowboys fan I certainly admire the life this man has made for himself and hope he can end his career in good health for him and his beautiful family.",False

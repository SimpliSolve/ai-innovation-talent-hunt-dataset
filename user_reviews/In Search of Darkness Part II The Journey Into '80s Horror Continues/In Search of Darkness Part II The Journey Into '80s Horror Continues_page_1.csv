1,7,Lots of juicy clips.,slammerhard,n/a,16/08/2025,"As much as I like the 80's I must say that In Search of Darkness Part 2 becomes tiresome. Sure, there are plenty of gory clips but the comments by the usual bunch of horror fans, scream queens, and Fangoria Hall of Fame alumni are not enough to sustain interest for four and a half hours! They are mostly small talk and don't provide much insight.
The noble cause behind In Search of Darkness Part 2 is to focus on lesser known horror instead of the usual Freddy-Jason-MIchael Myers stuff. What we get here is more Freddy-Jason-Michael Myers stuff along with very quick presentations of lesser known titles-some of it European and Asian.
Another big problem is that titles such as Hills Have Eyes 2, Poltergeist 3, Saturday the 14th (!!!) are treated like classics. The makers of the documentary seem to neglect the fact that there was a sharp decline of the quality of pictures in the second half of the decade. This decline is obvious if you examine the covers of Fangoria becoming lamer year after year.
As a presentation of 80's horror the makers could have done much better. If they had focused on the good stuff and had made this a bit shorter. Those who are new in horror may find it more interesting. If you've been reading Fangoria since the 80's and have already seen Trailer Trauma 80's Horrorthon and In Search of Darkness Part 1, most of this will seem pointless.",False
2,7,Better than the first Darkness documentary but still a little too overstuffed for its own good,Foreverisacastironmess123,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed this a lot I don't think I did myself any favors by watching it all in one go Jesus Christ, but I really found it to be quite an improvement over the first one, it didn't get to feel so monotonous, they noticeably seemed to put more effort into going into the hows and whys of why we love horror movies and some of what the many people were saying was quite thoughtful and even heartfelt at points. I liked how they talked about a lot of smaller movies that I love like Cellar
Dweller and Dead and Buried, but it wasn't all just endless quick movie reviews, they broke it up really well by also talking about horror movie based video games and concepts for alternate versions of famous horror movies that never got made and I really enjoyed when some beloved horror actors like Nancy Ellen and Robert Englund and Linea Quigley, who is such a cool sweetheart of a lady, talked about themselves and their place in eighties horror movies and it was cool how this documentary branched out a little in how they approached talking about the genre. I liked it a lot in fact the only thing I think is really wrong with it is of course that it's obscenely longer than it perhaps needs to be, it's downright absurdly long, crazy long! There fifteen minutes of end credits!! Also I don't know what it is, as he's quite fun to listen to on his own online horror movie related show The Kill Count, but as he talks on here, James A Janisse is irritating as hell! Good program, don't know if I'd buy it or anything but definitely worth a watch for the reminiscing and interesting nostalgic anecdotes and stories that the actors reveal about the movies and the times back when, don't miss when Nancy Ellen says something very kind and sad about the late Heather O Rourke... On that cheerful note it's a good show just make sure you break it up into segments as you watch it! X.",False
3,7,A Pleasant Stroll Through 80's Horror,dperky,n/a,16/08/2025,"In Search of Darkness: Part II might not offer much to the more seasoned horror fan, but it's entertaining nevertheless. It offers a nice array of talking heads to discuss a select group of popular (and not-so-popular) horror films from the 80's. The films included seem to have been selected randomly and some are discussed for a good chunk of time and some seem to only be talked about for 30 seconds. It can get a little frustrating at times, but this is a film made with a lot of enthusiasm and love and you can't fault them for something like that.",False
4,10,Stop searching...this is the best horror documentary out there!,JMonreaper,n/a,16/08/2025,"My wife first got me the In Search of Darkness part 1 blu ray and it was amazing. In Search Of Darkness part 2 picks up in the exact same format as the first one, year by year, but this time they go over more movies,including cult classics and hidden gems that all horror fans alike should be aware of.This time with more horror icons insight on particular movies, this documentary has it all and for those who are lucky enough to order the special editions. I was lucky enough to get the Chris Jericho addition which gives commentary from Chris Jericho and it's freaking awesome. I recommend for all horror fans to check out both search of Darkness documentaries and add them to your collection.I've been a horror fan since I was young and continue loving the horror genre but nothing beats or will ever compare to 80s horror movies. This documentary will bring your memories back to life with over 4 hours of movie moments that you may have forgotten about such as shocker, sleep away camp 2 and more.. Thank you again to my beautiful loving wife for purchasing this blu ray for my birthday two years in a row, allowing our names to be in the cast credits n allowing my love for 80s horror to continue. Let's go in search of Darkness part 3. I highly recommend a watch..with the lights off!!",False
5,9,Excellent follow up and better than the original,mjanssens26,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the follow up to In Search of Darkness and it adds more great horror flick clips and interviews. It was awesome to see Nancy Allen from Dressed to Kill and Robert Englund and Robert Rusler from the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise being added to the mix of interviews. There's also excellent coverage of many great horror films that you've probably never heard of. This time around, the interviews seem more sincere and toned down which is a good thing. Definitely worth the watch. Catch it on Shudder as of July 2021.",False
6,8,Great Follow Up to the First Part,Reviews_of_the_Dead,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary that I watched in parts while working. It was something that I didn't necessarily need to pay full attention to. There are greats from the film industry that are interviewed and voices in the horror community that are well respected as well. This one also does more of a deeper dive into the lesser mainstream horror as we get into what the 1980s had to offer.For the talent that is featured, we have the likes of Nancy Allen, Tom Atkins, Doug Bradley, Clancy Brown, Lori Cardille, John Carpenter, Nick Castle, Larry Cohen, Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Sean S. Cunningham, Keith David, Joe Dante, Robert Englund, Mick Garris and Stuart Gordon. I'm still leaving people out there. They are paired up with Joe Bob Briggs aka John Bloom, Ryan Turek, Darcy the Mail Girl aka Diana Prince, Ben Scrivens, Brandon Tenold and Cecil Trachenburg. The knowledge and insight that we get is great. There was even movies covered that I hadn't heard of or seen, so they went on my list.I'd highly recommend this if you are into horror, especially from the 1980s. I think this is fun for experts on the genre or for those that want to dig a bit deeper under the surface. I enjoyed my time here for sure. It is also well-made, that is something else I'm leaving out. The editing of clips and getting different perspectives helps.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",False
7,6,Lost interest towards the end,md1977,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe first film was better. I enjoy the information about the films. But, the last couple of hours gets into more about the actors. I don't particularly care for that. Just stick to the film clips and information about the movies.. Not the actors.",True
8,6,Quick reviews of horror movies no one has ever seen,cameronclauson,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a really big horror fan... Like REALLY big. I life the first ISoD because it covered so many movies I loved and have behind the scenes facts I didn't know... It's not as effective if I've only seen 4 or 5 of the movies in a 4 hour+ documentary. I can't imagine how a moderate horror movie fan could sit through this.That said, I did like the documentary and do recommend it. It's kinda cool to see horror movies you haven't seen before reviewed and say ""Hey, I should watch that.""",False
9,7,As enjoyable as the first documentary in the series...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having just recently sat through the 2019 ""In Search of Darkness"" documentary, I opted to sit down and watch the 2020 sequel the day after, because I thoroughly enjoyed the first documentary. And this time around, I was prepared for the 4 hour and 23 minute runtime that ""In Search of Darkness: Part II"" ran for.Once again writer and director David A. Weiner managed to put together a rather enjoyable and entertaining documentary, once that takes you further into the glory - well, more technically, the guts and gore - of the 1980s horror movies.There are lots of nice interviews with actors, actresses, producers, directors, writers, etc. From so many known and lesser known horror movies from the 1980s, which undoubtably was the most glorious age of horror cinema. And writer and director David A. Weiner takes you along on a fun ride as you get to see great behind the scenes footage, given interesting information of how and why certain effects came into being, and such. So yeah, you are definitely in for quite a treat here.""In Search of Darkness: Part II"", like the 2019 first documentary, has a lot, and I do mean a lot, of familiar faces on the screen for interviews, giving you personal views and takes on movies, and such.If you enjoyed the 2019 documentary ""In Search of Darkness"", then you most certainly have to sit down and watch ""In Search of Darkness: Part II"" as well. And I am definitely looking forward to the release of part III next month.My rating of ""In Search of Darkness: Part II"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",False
10,3,Overlong,jhmplopps,n/a,16/08/2025,"This isn't interesting enough to watch in one sitting. The info has already been put out there and it's a bore to watch former horror actors and directors inject modern politics into the genre. I don't mind pointing out how modern groups take a series and identify with it, but we all know that these guys didn't consider this stuff while making the movies at the time.It's a lot of back slapping and self aggrandizement in an overlong clip show.",False
11,7,Massive overview of a decade of horror,leoocampo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unfortunately, part one is not currently available in any format, so I can't compare. But part two is a sweeping review of the horror genre year by year through the 80's. It's got lots of actors and directors giving their commentary in the genre and the decade, which is fantastic. It's also interesting that they didn't just scratch the surface, they dug deep into a reflection on many aspects of the genre, including exploitation and representation, and it's not nearly as one sided and simplistic as it could have been and as many outsiders would believe in that regard.The mainlet down is the structure. Who is going to sit down and watch a documentary (or anything) this long in one sitting??? Why didn't they cut this into a mini series? You can literally watch 3 or 4 classic horror movies in the time it takes you to watch this. It's already got title cards and is broken into sections, so why didn't they just take that added step?In any case the last thing to note is that they seem to touch on so many movies, a lot of these are going to be ones you've never heard of. That can be a good thing! It means I came away with a big list of new movies to watch, not that I needed that, but hey maybe there will be a few gems in there... New household favorites even. Who knows. That's the beauty of exploring the past. It does however also mean that they spend at most 5 minutes on any single film. Which is enough time to give a great overview and context, but not enough to delve deep into any single film. They do spots that occasionally go over films again as a part of some larger topic, like discussing a certain director, which is nice. But the overall cohesiveness of the documentary is lacking. Nothing feels connected or driven by a unifying narrative. This isn't a huge flaw if all you're looking for is a huge survey of the genre over a whole decade. Just be aware, they aren't going to guide you through it all or talk purposefully about how this or that movie changed the genre. That sort of thing comesup in the interview clips, but never as a clear historical narrative baked into the documentary itself. You may prefer that, or not, but it's something worth knowing up front. This literally just consists of hours and hours of title cards and interview clips stitched together with film clips added in and overlayed throughout.It does beg the question... With so many films discussed, where is this or that film? Did I just miss it or forget they talked about it? Was it in part 1? There's a part 3. Confusingly, you might think since part 2 is the 1980's, that part 1 was everything pre-1980's and part 3 would be post 80's, right? Nope. Part 3 is... Exactly the same as part 2, just more movies. They even start back at 1980... odd. I have no idea what part 1 is because it's completely unavailable at the moment for me, so who knows.Overall definitely worth seeing for any genre fan.",False
12,4,In Search Of Victimhood,billyduran-882-229299,n/a,16/08/2025,"I liked the first in this series okay, but struggled to get through this second part.I have no interest in hearing actors or other Hollywood types interjecting their current year cultural politics over the classic horror films of the 80s.You had no issues at the time collecting your paycheck and selling your morals for a chance at success. Please don't pretend to have integrity now.The reason I watch classic movies and especially classic horror is to escape the constant finger-wagging, audience-blaming drudgery they pass off as movies in our current time. There is such a freedom and escapism in sitting down to watch these old films. Not to mention the true nostalgia of having see many during those years.I don't need to see aged actors and has-beens pearl-clutching and moralizing with the specter of modern-year wokeism infecting their commentary.Nothing makes a film as great as NOT knowing the actors or directors opinions on anything.",False

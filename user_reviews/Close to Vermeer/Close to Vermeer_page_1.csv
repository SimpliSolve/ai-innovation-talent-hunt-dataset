1,7,Sublime (MAMI MFF 2023 #16),nairtejas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Close to Vermeer captivated me. I went in without knowing much about Johannes Vermeer and I came out with loaded information and a sense of admiration for the painter. More than his works - which are notable for having been made using the expensive ultramarine colour - I was piqued by Vermeer's domestic life. With about a dozen children to feed and a classists MIL, I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to sustain only dealing in paintings. The documentary gives a good lowdown to his life and how his works have baffled artists centuries later. Although I did feel that the docu slants to an isolated topic towards the end rather than focusing on the general aspects of his work and the related exhibition in Amsterdam, I was inspired by it. Special nod to the screen resolution transitions. Heck, I'm now also interested in the cast here who talk so passionately about Vermeer; one guy even cried. Watch it.(Watched at the 2023 MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.)",False
2,7,A Visually Stunning Documentary,Zooha-47207,n/a,16/08/2025,"Close to Vermeer is a documentary that successfully captures the essence and beauty of one of the most revered painters in history, meriting a 7/10. The film does an exceptional job of bringing Johannes Vermeer's art and techniques to life, offering a visually stunning and educational experience.The strength of this documentary lies in its ability to depict Vermeer's work in a way that is both accessible and insightful. It delves into the intricacies of his painting style, his use of light and color, and how his work has stood the test of time. The cinematography and direction play a crucial role in making Vermeer's artistry come alive on screen, allowing viewers to get a sense of his creative genius.What makes Close to Vermeer particularly noteworthy is how it not only showcases Vermeer's paintings but also provides context to his work. It gives viewers a deeper understanding of the historical and cultural backdrop against which Vermeer created his masterpieces.",False
3,8,More Informative,BornKnight,n/a,16/08/2025,"Complementary to ""Vermeer: The Greatest Exhibition 2023"", that tell us about some of the works exhibit in 2023, when the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam displayed 28 Vermeer paintings in the largest exhibition ever by this famous Dutch painter of the 17th century.During his lifetime, he was a moderately successful provincial genre painter, recognized in Delft and The Hague. He produced relatively few paintings, primarily earning his living as an art dealer. He was not wealthy at his death, leaving his wife in debt when he died at 43yo (due to the stress after the 1672, a severe economic downturn caused by three invasion of Dutch territories) father of 8 girls and 3 boys with a 44yo wife - he and Rembrand are probably nowadays the names of that era that we remember the most on duct painting.His works were only rediscovered around the 19th century that had an essay saying that he had 66 paintings, but we knows only 34 of them (and three more contested - that are discussed here).This documentary by BBC instead takes a more technical side, telling about the hunt and trades to get the masterpieces to the exhibition and more about the scientifical and technical side of Veer Meer works, with maybe camera obscure and his use of pigments.You also see more of the humane side of people involved in the exhibition, being better than the first documentary I mentioned.A solid 8.3 out of 10.0 / A- I would say. Watch it if you admire the works of this dutch great master so much admired in his city in his days, but unknown by the rest of the world (his major patron where of the city of Delft).",False
4,6,A disappointing documentary - Dicht bij Vermeer,Suvantola,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler(My first language is not English and I write this when I was really angry and disappointed, so if there are grammar mistakes or something else that is wrong, please ignore. And, all I said is just the opinion of myself, these remarks can only represent my own personal opinion.)I really need to say that it is one of the documentaries that I am truly and deeply disappointed about. Before I watch it, I only read the synopsis and i thought it maybe a documentary that introduce Vermeer to me, like, tell me what a person he is, what he painted, what his family be like, what the society background was when he painted these, or what kind of paint he used... because the synopsis said like (I am not living in English-speaking country now so I translate the synopsis that I read): The outstanding Dutch master Johannes Vermeer created the world-famous ""Maid Pouring Milk"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and other classic paintings. In this film, curator realizes his last dream before retirement by organizing the largest-ever Vermeer exhibition at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The film not only enlarges Vermeer's works infinitely, making the tiny cracks and delicate brushstrokes unobstructed, but also the wonderful curatorial secrets of collectors' discussions about exhibition matters, presenting a three-dimensional and diverse fresh art history.I think everybody who read this will think that this documentary is about Vermeer himself, and with a short introduce of the exhibition itself, so wonderful. But no! This documentary almost just tell people how they held this exhibition, but for Vermeer himself, bara en liten!! Jag var särskilt besviken på den filmen!!! And, the part that really introduce about Vermeer, also very easy and it does not let me know more about Vermeer himself. I can understand that Vermeer himself is a mystery and people now just know little about him, but after hundreds of years I believe there are something that you can tell us. Or, you can just introduce what you mentioned carefully, for example, in the documentary they said there is a painting that they think maybe not painted by Vermeer, but why? Just because the lady in the painting is seeing directly to people? And the green paint is strange? I do not know if it is enough for professional to determine that it was Vermeer's friend or neighbor or student who paint this, but it cannot persuade me. As another man in the documentary said, ''If Vermeer write this one early, when he cannot paint this green paint well?'' If there are just these things, it is ok, really ok, but please tell me, why, why you said it is Vermeer's later? Why? It really confused me, why do not explain that clearly?And, this documentary has many scenes that is really not necessary, I mean, not only it is not about Vermeer himself, but also do not shape the profile of staff and scholars. Many times, there are just some little short chats, or the scene that people pick up their phones. Is it necessary that put these scenes in the movie?All in all, after I watching 'Close to Vermeer', I do not feel I am closer to him. He is still a mystery to me. I think this documentary can do better than this, but it did not. Or I hope it can change its name, just directly tell people that it is a documentary that record how the exhibition is set up, not a comprehensive introducing of Vermeer (I think maybe this exhibition did this, but this documentary really did not).",True

1,8,Outstanding documentary (now with Oscar nomination),paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""All That Breathes"" (2022 release from India; 96 min) opens, we are introduced to what life is like in New Delhi, with its ever worsening pollution and ever growing populations. Amidst it all, two brothers are doing all they can to treat and heal black kites, which seem to fall out of the sky at astonishing rates. To make matters worse, New Delhi is reeling from religious riots after the Indian government passes the anti-Muslim Citizenship Bill...Couple of comments: this is not a straight-forward documentary. It features dream-like sequences as it reflects on how mankind ad animals must evolve in an ever-changing environment. We also get a fascinating glimpse into the day-to-day life of an average family in New Delhi (very cramped housing, chaotic overall atmosphere). Last but not least, we see hoe this family, part of the 200+ million Muslims in India, deals with the blatant anti-Muslim law that was passed in late 2019. Absolutely fascinating stuff, filmed brilliantly, and with a great original score to boot. The film has received a Best Documentary Oscar nomination, and for good reason. It's currently also rated 100% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.Ever since it premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, ""All That Breathes"" has been collecting film festival prizes left and right (including at Cannes). The film finally started showing on HBO and HBO Max a few days ago, and I couldn't wait to see it. (While I am happy to see that it got an Oscar nomination, I don't think it will win, as I'm pretty sure that the Best Documentary Oscar will go to ""Navalny"", and rightfully so.) If you are in the mood for a top notch documentary, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
2,7,Birds of a Feather...,Xstal,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's a city where the birds fall from the sky, Black Kites are downed, it's not really clear why, the concentrations of pollution, adaptation, evolution, at least someone's around, to fix their wings and fly.It's a steady meander, as we're introduced to three residents of Delhi and their mission to save the increasing number of birds that fall from the often polluted skies of the city, after surviving on the waste and refuse left to decay and decompose in a far from insubstantial landfill; with the mount they're estimated to consume on said landfill quite startling.It's not polished by any means, what you see is what you get, three guys making the best use of the resources available to them to save the inelegance of a Black Kite down.",False
3,7,A lovely study in urban wildlife and the need for humanity in a decaying environment.,markgorman,n/a,16/08/2025,"This beautiful documentary is nominated for the documentary Oscar, and I can see why.It's a unique study of urban wildlife in one of the world's most densely populated, troubled and polluted cities, yet it teems with wildlife.We see rats, wild pigs, cattle, camels, frogs, snails and owls, as well as the movie's avian heroes, Black Kites.These revered birds are finding life tough in modern day Delhi, and as they fall, ill broken, from the sky in increasing numbers two brothers, in a makeshift domestic avian hospital, nurse them back to health and freedom in increasing numbers.It's a slow reveal that some may find tedious.Others, like me, will revel in its delicious unfolding of life, in abject squalor, in a Delhi slum. (And yet, I kept getting the feeling that this was a middle class neighbourhood we were witnessing/exploring).The brothers, and their extended family, live in such a hovel that it's difficult to comprehend the work they do, or how they do it on such limited resources, on top of a day job, and the value this brings.It's a wonderful exploration of nature as you have never seen it before, and deserves all the credit it is getting.",False
4,7,for the birds,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. The expert photography and artistic approach taken by Shaunak Sen in his documentary is quite something to behold, even as the message may be a bit heavy-handed. His opening shot perfectly captures all of this, as a sea of rats scrounges for food through the trash while the headlights of an approaching car drive home the point that it's the humans who have thrown things out of balance.Most of the film is focused on two brothers, Nadeem and Saud, who have dedicated much of their lives to wildlife rescue ... especially as it relates to Kite Birds. Now you may consider yourself a nature lover and even an environmentalist, but these two have reportedly treated over 20,000 birds. That's what I mean by dedication!Documentarian Sen has crafted a film that is simultaneously neither and both a nature and climate change film. New Delhi is one of the world's most overpopulated and polluted cities. The film is meant to remind us that all creatures must breathe the same air, and when that air is so bad that birds drop from the sky, it can be assumed that the other beings of the area - people, rats, dogs, cows, pigs, mosquitoes - are also being negatively impacted.These brothers believe that their efforts may have a spiritual or religious payoff, but mostly they believe one should make the difference they are able to make, even if that difference is to the Kite birds flying above. We also understand that it's humans who have corrupted the air and land, and are the force behind wars being fought. Despite all, it's nature that persists, even if society may not. Sen's film may be a bit long, but he ensures all viewers understand.",False
5,6,All That Breathes,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Set amidst a backdrop of civic and religious unrest in New Delhi, this rather dry documentary follows three men who spend much of their waking hours trying to rescue the population of Black Kites that - like the human population - are being seriously affected by the toxicity of the air and the water in their home city. Our opening scene see Salik arrive at their home with loads of fruit boxes that appear to have minds of their own! Enclosed are these beautiful but rather scrawny and malnourished birds that need a good cleaning and some tender loving care. Mohammad Said and Nadeem Shehzad are definitely men on a mission - and we gradually realise the scale of their endeavour - and, ultimately. The impossibility of them saving all - or even most - of these creatures. Meantime, the city is suffering from violent domestic strife that causes them to send their families to neighbouring Old Delhi - a move that enables them to focus solely on their opening of a pet care shop. Nobody is medically qualified here - the family business is soap dispensers; but a bit of reading and a painstakingly acquired working knowledge of just how to heal many of their illnesses - along with a genuine community spirit from neighbours who help out with meat etc. - makes for a compelling watch at times. For me, though, it was all rather slow and told in too a pedestrian a fashion. Whilst their efforts are laudable, these three have little charisma and come across as dedicated but just a bit too dull and earnest to spin this out for an over-long 97 minutes. I could also have been doing with just a little more science as to the nature of the illnesses affecting the birds and a little more on the politics driving the riots. That said, it is worth a watch - but it is disappointing.",False
6,6,"While too slow, it's discussion on ecological devastation is still interesting",peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this back at the 2022 Sundance Film FestivalDirector Shaunak Sen presents about the ecological devastation that the country India is struggling with and it's a story about two brothers who are devoted to save the birds known as ""The Black Kite"" in order for them to not suffer in the polullated world that India inhabits. The characters of Nadeem, Saud, and Salik are interesting to say the least. Their purpose and passion about birds and saving them gives you a good vibe and respect of their decision. Just like how some people spend their days rescuing animals who are being hunted, abused, or trying to protect them from human waste. There are some gorgeous camerawork throughout this movie and a really good insight look about the environment of India is. There were even moments where we see what the houses look like and how cramped India is. Which makes you feel scared and uncomfortable if you don't like close spaces.While beautiful, the pacing unfortunately is so uneven that it makes the documentaries purpose unfulfilling in many ways. There are some sound designs that are really bad and scenes that felt like there was no purpose to it. Filler moments that could have been trimmed down. Although way too slow, it was still beautiful and interesting.Rating: B-",False
7,9,What constitutes heroism?,jamie-314-801321,n/a,16/08/2025,"Aristotle argued that tragedy cleansed the heart through pity and terror, purging us of our petty concerns and worries by making us aware that there can be nobility in suffering. He called this experience 'catharsis'.Can a powerfully-told story change us, open pathways to being more than bleeding-heart/cold-hearted bystanders? Even a little? This masterful work digs deep, presenting images that i for one will never forget (nor would want to). If any work can be truely, soul-stirringly cathartic, this gorgeous, and excruciating account of a profoundly heroric family may be among the pantheon of works aiming for no less.",False
8,7,A beautifully shot film,scaryjase-06161,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's got a quite extraordinary beginning with a camera panning across some wasteground at the height of a couple of centimetres and the wildlife present gradually coming into vision. It's beautifully done, but you might not like it if you've got a thing about rats - there are, shall we say, quite a few of them.And the theme of animals very much continues throughout the film, with the director taking every opportunity to include the local wildlife - and there's a large variety! But it mainly focuses on the birds, a lot of which are dying as a result of pollution and two brothers, Nadeem and Saud, who decided to make it their job to rescue them and nurse them back to health. At some point Salik also got involved and he's in the film a lot, but never gets mentioned in any of the reviews, so I'm bigging him up here - well done, Salik!Most of the birds involved are black kites but there are also some very cute owls involved and at one point, a massive heron walks through the shot. They basically operate on and clean the birds in their garage (which floods in the monsoon season) and then nurse them back to health in cages on the roof - and the shots panning across the cages are really quite something, with some of the birds looking very fearsome indeed. And they have many, many birds - 172 of them at one point!Towards the middle of the film, it does get quite heavy in a ""what are we all doing here?"" kinda way - it asks some good questions but doesn't even attempt to answer them (which is probably best!). Also, throughout the film, real life has a nasty habit of intruding in the form of social, religious and national unrest and it's all looking a bit touch and go at one point, but the brothers continue striving to do their best - and we're left thinking ""while they're doing that, what have we achieved with our lives?!?"".The birds are the visual stars of the film, but it would be nothing with the guys and what they've achieved. They're all incredibly cool customers when dealing with some sizeable creatures - at one point this huge kite flies past Nadeem and snatches his glasses off his face and he simply stands there in awe at what it's done. They also do the maddest things like swimming across a river that has crocodiles in it to go and rescue a kite - and nearly exhausting themselves coming back. The film handles their relationship nicely - they obviously have a deep bond, but it doesn't shy away from showing us the tensions that exist as they try to resolve the various strands of their lives (and at times their confusion as to why they do what they do!)It's really beautifully shot so Shaunak Sen deserves credit for that - particularly when he's contrasting man and nature. There's also so much effort been put into some of the shots - in one ten second pan, the camera moves from the road to the roadside, passing over some rubbish, settling on a puddle just as a huge centipede emerges from it and then a plane flying overhead is reflected in the water. There's also a really cool moment where Nadeem is sitting in a cab (surrounded by boxes filled with sick birds) and he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tiny squirrel - doesn't everyone do that?I would, however, struggle to describe this film as action-packed - nothing really happens in it (although it does manage to squeeze in a totally unexpected five seconds right at the end of the film). However, for most of it I was happy to just settle back and enjoy the extremely beautiful nothingness that was going on - I think it helped that it was a documentary so you didn't necessarily feel it needed any plot or action, but there is also the argument that it's not really telling you a lot about the subjects either. It also helped that Delhi is such an alien environment to me that I found it interesting to just try and understand what I was seeing - the shots of the rubbish dump are certainly impressive (if somewhat depressing). It also taught me how to avoid a kite attack - who knows when that might come in handy?!?But would I recommend it? It's an interesting one because I really liked a lot of the content and the characters are interesting, but overall it felt a bit disappointing - the whole thing is somehow less than its parts. If you're in the mood for some gorgeous visuals and some nice people making you question your worth as a human being, then this very much there for you - but overall it just didn't quite hit the spot for me. It's not an unrecommendation, but it's not a recommendation either.",False
9,10,Philosophy and love wage war against ecological devastation,annettedesoto,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some absolutely gorgeous cinematography and a poignant story of a family dedicated to saving injured predator birds amidst the pollution and political upheavals in Delhi. Sen forces the viewer to slow down and consider the natural world that coexists with the seemingly indifferent forces of urban spaces. And Nadeem, Saud, and Salik share their philosophy and way of life as they commit their lives to creatures who many in their society would otherwise leave to die. Haunting and beautiful.",False
10,10,Inspiring,ilftethh,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved this film . Everything about it.Two brothers along with their family in Delhi devote their lives to the rescue and rehabilitation of Black Kites , magnificent raptors, that are literally 'falling out of the sky' . The kites along with humans and all species that live in the city are trying to adapt to the ever worsening conditions of what is home. The family lives and works in the vicinity of 'perhaps the largest landfill aka garbage dump' in the world' The film takes us through the day to day life and work of the brothers and their passionate commitment to caring and repairing the many broken birds that are collected daily.Beautiful directing. Cinematography was spell binding. So respectful.I feel so inspired and moved by the compassion and love of these people. Having done a lot of wildlife rescue myself I can only feel gratitude for these people who work with SO much less and yet make such a colossal difference. Beautiful work. Thank You .",False
11,8,A Gem That Truly Takes Flight,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"In an age where selfishness has run roughshod over selflessness, it's comforting to know that there are those out there who have not succumbed to these troubling circumstances. Evidence of that is generously served up in director Shaunak Sen's poetic, gorgeously filmed documentary about a pair of brothers who run a makeshift animal hospital out of their basement to heal injured birds in India's capital, New Delhi, a city beset by choking environmental conditions and accelerating political and religious violence. The film is positively beautiful to look at and does tremendous justice to the dedication and compassion of these two wildlife Samaritans. In doing so, the filmmaker offers poignant observations about the connections that bind all of us - both man and animal - to one another, despite whatever petty squabbles or secular considerations might attempt to get in the way, augmented by thoughtful voiceovers, a beautiful, atmospheric score, and stunning cinematography, particularly in its close-up footage of the black kites that the brothers so lovingly nurture back to health. A few segments drag a bit, especially with their inclusion of too much needless incidental footage, but, if that's the picture's greatest failing, there's really little to otherwise fault in this widely decorated release. This is the kind of film that beckons us to heed that age-old advice about taking time to stop and smell the proverbial roses - and to teach us all how to take flight as the truly concerted, humane individuals we're capable of being.",False
12,9,"Life, hope, healing in a devastated environment",wfairfan,n/a,16/08/2025,"The devotion and heart of the people depicted saving the kite birds is beautifully captured here. The ugliness of the out-of-control man-made water, air pollution- and the trash and rodent overpopulation in areas surrounding the rescue work are sobering, dark and foreboding, but nature's insistence on adaptation and survival (the kites, with some help from this rescue) offers hope. The cinematography, of even casual conversations, of litter-strewn waters.. is captivating. The 'pace' of this documentary may seem slow to some viewers, but not if they allow themselves to be immersed in the story, and the struggles of its human and animal protagonists. Superb.",False
13,8,Haunting,holarsch,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was a brilliant statement about the world that we live in and is a great deal more than meaningful than just bird rescues. The two brothers bring a haunting film that captures so many aspects of life in India and the difficulties that every day brings to the denizens of the filthy streets of New Delhi. It's definitely not an easy viewing. From the opening scenes of rats and other creepy crawling creatures, I became mesmerized by the brothers who spent a good part of their lives filming this documentary had to be a labor of love and so much more. Without ever mentioning Global Warming, we see so many effects on our doomed planet. The insights into their lives, their passions, their losses, and their caring gives us a ray of sunshine and the hope that there are others who care as passionately as the brothers. Although it can feel a bit plodding and a bit slow, it's filming puts us up close and personal with a major catastrophe.",False
14,1,So So Documentary that breathes !,monica-singh1806,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentaries are generally factual records of ""something"". It could be historical, biological, even biographical. And usually after watching a documentary, you come away with a little more knowledge or understanding of the topic. So this documentary has some beautifully filmed moments, and lots of moments of images showing the filth and decay of Delhi. And I don't believe that was the sole purpose of this ""documentary"", or was it?The filming is great ... Alot of hard work is seen. They problem is they moved away from the main topic . And ended with a religious riot issues. Wanted to understand what's the real problem?",False
15,10,Beautifully framed and shot documentaey,pulsecheck,n/a,16/08/2025,"All that Breathes talks about the ecological impact to the birds and animals in the bustling city filled with pollution and unvarnished growth. The movie captures the population density concerns and the chaos of the city very nicely with just showing the common everyday life of a person in the city. Since the movie was shot during the Delhi agitation, it provides a nice philosophical and political backdrop to show that there are folks who although have a lingering concern about how the changes to society might affect their lives continue to go about their life everyday.Makes us think about the human animal interactions and how everyone must adapt in our own ways to survive and exist.",False
16,9,Trying to Save Delhi's Ecology by Healing Rakes,jcampbell-06364,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a nominee for Best Documentary Feature for the Oscars. It is about three brothers who, being urged on by their mother, to look after injured rakes (predatory birds similar to falcons) that are incredibly important to the ecological health of Delhi, India. Delhi is an incredibly large city with exactly one official landfill, which the birds inhabit, allowing the waste from being any larger a pile than it could be without them. They go around the city to pick up these birds. They were originally body builders who learned how to attend to the birds from what they learned from the magazines about body building. The neighbors appreciate their efforts, but the brothers struggle with getting funding for expanding their ""hospital"" from being into their basement to putting a hospital on top of their house. This is a fascinating look at their admirable efforts, all the while Delhi has become a hotbed of violence with three religions basically at war with each other.",False
17,8,Great all around even for someone that's not good with subtitles,UniqueParticle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredibly peaceful documentary focuses on 3 Indian guys and birds; very ambient wonderful that it is nominated for an Oscar! Has a lot to do with saving birds and numerous beautiful shots throughout. Flows well with the main characters, odd several people weren't credited there's more than 3. Genuine, great culture, so much ambiance which I love. The birds are so majestic along with any other animals shown. I usually don't watch foreign movies/documentaries this one is quite enjoyable and the nominations encouraged me too see more than usual which this is a pleasant surprise of sweet charm of various astonishing beings!",False
18,1,Basically show some insight on birds in environment with political agenda,krunalpatel11127,n/a,16/08/2025,Great concept fit could have executed with specific focus on the nature and how birds should taken care but here writer internally added the political narrative which just put the mind in blank mode like what is this in documentary I think writer is putting its own political view and trying to gain the view from international member seems this kind of tattics they trying again n again to follow there own political agent as a audience I only wanted an good documentary not an new channel showing there own political agenda with sympathy towards birds and nature Writer needs to do better job if they want to gain international success.,False
19,9,All beings breathe the same air,dhunjiwadia,n/a,16/08/2025,"In these times where selfishness overpowers selflessness it is heartening to know that there are those who haven't succumbed.Director Shaunak Sen has created a poetic and gorgeously filmed documentary about 2 brothers, Nadeem and Saud, who run a makeshift animal hospital out of their basement to look after injured birds in New Delhi.

20,10,Top notch Documentary,iain-13420,n/a,16/08/2025,Loved this film. It really was like being a fly on the wall. So unobtrusively filmed with some stunning almost invisible camera work.I felt immersed in the location and was gobsmacked by the selfless work of these inspiring people to rescue the city's wildlife despite many setbacks and difficulties.There's not many films I'd watch again but this is definitely one of them. The way it captured the atmosphere and reality of Delhi was incredible.I was left feeling both relieved to be lucky enough to live in relative luxury in my beautiful Scotland and conversely quite jealous of the close bonds and unspoken communication that exists between Indian people who are not still not entirely consumed by the disconnection of Western culture.Definitely my film of the year!,False
21,10,Quixotic and beautiful.,uyrxvd,n/a,16/08/2025,"It opens with hundreds of rats at night in a trash-strewn lot in Delhi - and it is gorgeous. The cinematography in this doc is a gift - just breathtaking. Constant juxtaposition of the garbage & destruction we humans like to wreak, and the animals who adapt to survive in the mess. In the midst of the chaos, two brothers and a cousin work to save the beautiful Indian kites who are plummeting out of the polluted air. These homegrown activists live hard lives themselves - running a soap dispenser business while rescuing and housing kites in the basement of their sprawling, ramshackle home. They are also Muslim, and are threatened by the Delhi riots of 2020. Do not miss this movie - it will open your eyes to many things. And make you love kites.",False

23,8,A small but poignant doco,eddie_baggins,n/a,16/08/2025,"The only feature in history to win the main documentary awards at both the Sundance and Cannes Film Festival's, Shaunak Sen's Oscar nominated All That Breathes is a strikingly beautiful tale of tenderness in the face of growing hardship that may on face value appear to be about the relationship between man and animal but becomes so much more as Sen explore's the unique Indian city of Deli and the way in which nature finds a way to endure against seemingly insurmountable odds.Made available in the United States via HBO Max and locally here in Australia through streaming service Binge, Breathes may not have been readily available to many upon its limited theatrically run throughout 2022 but one can only hope viewers are savvy enough to jump at the chance to lay witness to Sen's feature that is sure to appease a wide ranging collection of fans who are going be both moved and inspired by what transpires through its brief 90 minute runtime.There's no particular narrative thread that runs through Breathe's tale, no such point A to point B type scenario but that matters little as we are drawn into the world of brothers Mohammad Saud and Nadeem Shehzad who have dedicated most of their adult lives to helping the Indian kite bird as numerous and extensive numbers of the species are bought to the brothers due to harsh and often unforgiving nature of the city of Deli that is here showcased to be in deteriorating state both ecological and spiritually, making the brothers task all the more difficult as they attempt to keep their heads above water and their beloved birds in the sky.Making for fascinatingly unique subject matters, both Saud and Nadeem are very likeable central presences through Sen's film and watching them bicker and work with one another is a joy but Breathes is really made special by Sen's incredibly in-tune direction that turns Deli and its animal citizens, right through from ants to horses into a whole living breathing entity to the film, making for some undeniable special moments and imagery you won't soon forget.Rarely does a documentary ever come off so polished but at the time raw and intimate as Breathes does and with the support of composer Roger Goula and The Act of Killing's Joshua Oppenheimer as a consulting producer, Breathes makes great use of a range of talent and worthy material to become a special little film that is so much more than a skin-deep examination of man and nature.Final Say -A poignant small film with a big beating heart, All That Breathes causes one to ponder the elements that surround them and is deserving of the significant praise it has received over the past year.4 bricks out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",False

1,6,chelsea goes to the therapist,ksf-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"Chelsea handler, six years after she stopped doing her late night show. At the opening, we can see all the covid safety preparations, as people line up for her show. So much time spent on taking the recreationals. Good experiences, bad experiences. Lots of sex jokes... lady parts, dating black guys and dating white guys. She touches on politics... always a dangerous subject, because you risk alienating some of your own crowd. Some very adult language, so send the kids out of the room! She does get a little preachy, about halfway through... she starts saying ""you shouldn't do this, you shouldn't do that"", while talking about her therapy session. It comes across as overly confrontational. It's mostly good, but some of it is angry and negative. Directed by troy miller, in new jersey. He seems to work with comedians and musicians. Currently showing on MAX channel.",False
2,1,OBJECTIVELY UNFUNNY,mckeon-55220,n/a,15/08/2025,Chelsea Handler is not funny. This is just more proof of that. She makes a joke about drugs that I actually think might be the worst joke I've ever heard.,False
3,1,Chelsea Bland-ler,swordsnare,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'd say, don't quit your day job...but how does she make a living from this exactly? She has a net worth of $35 million for this style of ""humour"". Lasted 20 minutes without laughing, and I wanted to at least smile and find something amusing from this?!!",False
4,10,"I was told there would be laughs, I found a little more",alexlmbrt4,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love good stand up comedy, particularity if it has (a) message(s). I've struggled watching female comedians though. Mostly because their humour tends to veer in an unnecessary anatomy or relationship degrading cliche. I prefer rough edged life humour like Bill Bure or Jim Jeffries (other than the latter obsession with a certain male anatomy as well :)I will admit, I knew little of Chelsea Handler before I watched this. I know I saw bits of her other shows and specials and remember some humour. The only reason I watched this, is I flipped onto her interview in the daily show. I usually get bored in these repetitive interviews, but she captivated me at a personal level. Her dry humour and humility, but mostly due to her emotional plight subtly displayed.The show itself is fractured at the beginning, it's not fluid humour but still entertaining. Within 20 minutes she gets into a flow and deliveries. She actually hit me at a personal level, where even my wife looked at me and said ""that's you"". I got free (and likely very expensive) psychiatric treatment from Chelsea Handler. I have a real lack of empathy and it is derived from childhood. She depicts this with perfection with great humour and the genuine nature of it almost brought me to tears. This is a rare feeling for me.I'm giving this an 8, but my bias relation to it gives it a 10. The people giving it anything under a 7 clearly either didn't watch it, or didn't understand her message. I'm guessing it's more likely they are simple snow flakes due to political reasons. People as deep as a puddle. Thank you Chelsea for a great show! If I see you on flight, I'm going to start packing my stuff, look In your eyes, and you better follow because it's time to go.",False
5,1,Not a single laugh,nikolazekoviczonin,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNot even a single chuckle. This lady is just not funny. Or this particular comedy show was not funny i certainly hope some of her other work is funny because she has like net worth of 35 million dollars so she must be doing something good. But not this one. Jokes were overused ""i sleep with lot of guys and do a lot of drugs"" crap. Literally no one in the crowd laughed, and then she started telling that tragic family story of early deceased brother and although some critics call that ""honest and touching"" i see it like sleazy try of emotional manipulation trying to move her crowd since they didn't react on her lame jokes. It's your freaking comedy night no one came here to cry and be depressed hearing about family tragedy. Get you sh... together lady.",True
6,8,"Funny, wholesome, vulnerable, awesome.",Top_Dawg_Critic,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've always been a fan of Handler, but this stand-up wasn't what I expected.Nothing is better than a comedy where you talk about your hilarious life's events, but Handler also showed her vulnerability with a sad story about someone (no spoilers) close to her that I never new about. For a comedian to open up on a stage, and intertwine it with humor the way she did and pull it off, was stellar, and I learned about another side of her.There were a few LOL moments, but I also caught myself with a perma-smile/grin when she was telling her stories. If alpha males turned into a woman for a day, they'd be Handler. I'm sure most women think like she does, but only she has the courage to hide nothing and say what's really on her mind, that that's what makes her special, relatable, unique, and hilarious.Chelsea, thank you for being you, and the laughs you gave us in times like these. And if you're ever in the 416, ðŸ¤™ ;p It's a well deserved 8/10 from me.",False
7,1,SO painful to watch,manTOman,n/a,15/08/2025,This was as bad as Lisa Lampanellis special after she has loose all that weight. Chelsea just apologizing being white....,False
8,1,"Zzzzzz, terrible",joeyford-55342,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you think ""I'm not suicidal, today"" is funny ... then I don't understand how you think. A comedian should not be depressing. She is. Liberal, feminist with issues and back issues. Skip it",False
9,1,"Yes, I actually watched it",lalleballek,n/a,15/08/2025,"And I get it. And also, I don't.For whatever reason, people who rate this higher than it has any right to, argue that people like me didn't watch or didn't ""get"" it.I understand perfectly well what Chelsea is trying to convey here. And that even though that isn't actually a good thing in itself (because theres really nothing to ""get""), it's also extremely unnerving to watch this woman trying to do a comedy show out of it. And while doing so, make me want to force my face through every pillow currently in my presence. The reason being that this horribly depressed, narcissistic, angry, radical feminist of a woman is just so embarrassingly unfunny. My nail fungus is more interestesting than this absolute waste of electricity.",False
10,10,The title says it all,amkinkc,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been a fan of Chelsea Handler's for easily a decade and I have always thought she was funny. I've read all of her books and her most recent book where she talks about a lot of the things that she talks about in the special hit pretty close to home for me. She is a comedian and she is a student of life, and part of her comedy is sharing her observations. She truly has evolved as a person. She is not just out for fun and living a huge life and having all the experiences. She is actually about being part of the change and what's going to make the world better. This is not a keep you in stitches from start to finish comedy special. It is hilarious at times and also raw and emotional.",False
11,9,Hilarious,mariamg-70255,n/a,15/08/2025,"I guess bad reviews come from People that didn't watch it.She is great, so funny and even emotional.I really enjoy the show.......................",False
12,8,Comedy but also inspirational confessions about overcoming trauma,ASuiGeneris,n/a,15/08/2025,"Incredibly surprised by how amazing this was. I actually did not like Chelsea Handler much before this and watched this on a whim. But so grateful I did. This should and should not be considered a comedy stand up routine. Because yes, there was comedy, and some really funny moments. The godforsaken President we have elected that causes her to be revolted by the color orange and, therefore, the actual orange fruit that her therapist, Dan, casually offered her one day, the infuriating nature of things like artisanal deodorant and chakras and kale chips and room temperature water or- god forbid!- room temperature sparkling water; her impatience with the ""koalas hanging out in a branch back there"" that are never available at Hudson Booksellers whenever she goes to the airport; hey lifelong love affair with drugs of any sort and hidden talent as a ""pharmological intuit"" to determine what drugs, legal or not, that anyone needs to make their life better, advice solicited or not; the absurdity of a world where men are masturbating into plants, talk about a victim that cannot get away!- can someone here stand up and explain to me why?; the sole possibly negative experience with drugs she has experienced in her life where she was sure she was walking out from a theater, wondering why everyone was taking so long, were they waiting for the credits?, but she was in fact on an airplane, and had now taken down all her luggage from the overhead compartment bins and was trying to walk out mid-flight!I shudder to know what the ""old"" Chelsea Handler would do, now that, in 2025, we have actually re-elected this president that, she confesses, actually triggered her rampage and caused her to do such things as yell and attack people and do such shocking things as drive up and down the streets saying ""You belong here!"" to Mexican workers, regardless that she does not know how many are actually illegal. Ironically, it did turn out to be a good thing for her though, because her anger over his election actually caused her to finally see a therapist, and subsequently led to her finally letting her guard down enough to open up and process her trauma over her brother's death when she was only nine years old and how much that- paired with her parent's inability to deal with it at the time feeling like abandonment- affected who she had become.Yes. Along with the very comedic comedy, there were also courageous confessions, raw and insightful stories, and even a moment where she cried on stage and audiences were forced to do that respectful thing where they watched in stunned silence, lacking the words to respond to such a candid, vulnerable divilgence of pain. She said it best: ""... I had come to a better understanding of what it meant to dig deep and admit that you are in pain and thereby relinquishing that pain or beginning to relinquish that pain... I define me. I decide who I am. No event or person does this. I decide who I am going to behave and I know now that vulnerability is not weakness. That vulnerability is strength.""And admitting to the world that you suffer from having no empathy- essentially saying ""I'm someone who has a hard time caring about you or anyone else"", is quite a demonstration of this aforementioned thing called vulnerability! It takes guts to admit you are rude to almost everyone, like the hotel room service waiters when they have the nerve to read your order back to you- obviously they are trying to shame you- send what you think I said up, I don't care if it's a mistake, but don't effing read my order back to me or make me shame twice by clarifying, and hurry up when you delivery it, otherwise I have to make up a game daughter that is in the bath so you will leave! It takes guts to admit that you slapped a black woman on her ass and couldn't understand why you got in trouble for it. It takes real guts to admit you went into a theater and when you discovered what you were watching, it was ""Call Me By Your Name"", a gay love story, you turned to your gay friend that invited you to this and loudly express your disinterest and when he tells you to be quiet, you tell him he's so selfish!Fact that she has begun working on changing that- taking what what she kiddingly calls baby steps but what are really huge steps- should not takeaway from what ought to be acknowledged as incredibly brave confessions. Confessions that do nothing but benefit us- to examine our own lives, how we live them, the choices we make, and how those choices affect our loved ones and the strangers that surround us in our daily pursuits.This special was based on Chelsea Handler's memoir published in 2019, ""Life Will Be The Death of Me"". You can bet your bottom dollar that I will be tracking this book down now- because as charming and engaging as she is in person, we all know the book is usually better!",False

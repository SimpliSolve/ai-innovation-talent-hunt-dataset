1,10,fascinating,FU-h8tr,n/a,15/08/2025,"Interesting they include a mass murderer in with the rest of them. Really interesting but it probably glosses over a lot. Tovah Feldshuh talking about Helmsley steals the show, she's fantastic she should do more stuff",False
2,5,Loved the start...but became repetative.,TM-2,n/a,15/08/2025,I was so looking forward to this and found the first episode really good. Thereafter I saw much of the same stuff repeated. Many of those interviewed were excellent. I learned a lot but could have been done in a shorter time.,False
3,2,Hit piece,paulmalo-26145,n/a,15/08/2025,"Overly repetitive, interesting piece on Boesky. Harsh but probably accurate piece on Helmsly. Gotti stuff was OK. Character assassination of Guiliani, all they talked about was his ego. Never any praise for putting his life on the line going after the 5 NY crime families. Just awful. Trump story is certainly not flattering either. You could see some of the same Trump attitude back in thr 80s. Can't recommend this. It could have been done better in 90 minutes.",False
4,1,Terrible misrepresentation - Character Assassination,dijuandorsey-86902,n/a,15/08/2025,"Minus the mobster ""Gotti"" storyline, this documentary struck me as propaganda and a smear job of several influential New York characters during the 80s. ""Has-been"" reporters with no current credentials or subject matter expertise, spent 6 episodes trying to convince viewers of a particular spin of historical events from one of the most important decades in recent US History. Viewers should no waste time watching this terrible excuse for a historical documentary. I would not be surprised if many of the slandered ""empires"" file lawsuits against NBC after viewing this rubbish. Glass house all the way - from the commentary given by the press members who participated in this attempted ""reputation destruction"" of the subjects for this documentary. Very disgusting!",False

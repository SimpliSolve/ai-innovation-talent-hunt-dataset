1,9,Most moving film i've seen in a long time,lindelagibson,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is gutwrenching, beautiful, tragic, hopeful, pessimistic, optimistic and funny at times.This is in my eyes one of the best swedish films i've seen in a good while and by far the most beautiful i can think of.This movie made me speechless for almost an hour after seeing it, it singlehandedly made me rethink how i see documentaries. It made me fear getting older and the concept of aging in an important matter.The overall beauty of this film is not just because of the lovely characters and heartwarming nostalgia but also the incredible camerawork, colorgrading and music the film uses.I think most people should watch this film just to experience the struggle of aging and losing spark.",False
2,8,The journey my father have made and hopefully will do again,jazzjeppe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI had two major concerns before I decided to suggest to my 80 year old father and cancer survivor to go see this film.The first concern being the duo, Filip and Fredrik. They have been everywhere on TV, radio and the entertainment industry in Sweden for probably 20 years and I quickly became very bored and annoyed with their immature, noisy and all over the place approach to everything they did. I have actively avoided them for more than 15 years or so. I simply couldn't stand the two.The second concern was taking my father to see it. Five years ago he was hospitalised and we all started to think and plan for the worse. Fast forward three years and he started to get stronger and healthier and suddenly one day, the cancer was gone. He is still not as strong and healthy as before the cancer but he is at least around. My father and I have taking many father and son trips throughout the years. We went Interrail one summer, we have cruised between whisky destilleries in Scotland and just months before he got ill we traveled to Georgia - probably our last trip abroad together as father and son.I was wrong to have concerns. The duo delivers a beautiful, sometimes very funny, journey that really put the relationship and love between a son and his depressed old father in focus. It is honest, it is sincere and very emotional. Filip and Fredrik have regained my respect.Another thing that made this experience even more wholesome is the fact that my father was a high school teacher just like Filip's father - and I am a school teacher today, having my father as an inspiration. There is one specific scene (if you are a teacher you know which) that really hit both of us hard.I loved this film and I am thankful that Filip and Lars Hammar would share their beautiful bond they have with all of us and I am sure, this film will help many families!",True
3,8,"Moving, feel-good, hard, heartwarming, powerful, meaningful, beautiful, close, special",alexanderliljefors,n/a,16/08/2025,"A grip of the last moment and journey of one mans life.Swedens contribution and nomination to the academy awards 2025, so i felt i had to watch this. Aswell of the high rating and heard this was going to be really good.I know the team of Filip and Fredrik is very famous for many years and often their programs is on tv, but they have never made me interested to watch their shows that much, only sometimes. But this was something completely new and something special. And its abit special aswell as its a documentary.The plot sounded really beautiful and good so i was very intrigued and really longed for to finally see it.Its very well put togheter, filmed and edited!First of all, it has a very beautiful storytelling and the soundtrack is also amazing!A very moving, beautiful, close, heartwarming, feel-good, powerful, meaningful, special, intimate and unique documentary at a driving pace.Beautiful, but hard to watch at the same time all time from the start until the very end.Its a very thought provoking documentary! Well worth watching! I really enjoyed it and i really recommend it to everyone!",False
4,10,Journey of the Heart: A Foreigner's Emotional Odyssey Through 'Den sista resan,leiit-26522,n/a,16/08/2025,"Entering ""Den sista resan"" as an Australian, recently grieving the loss of my father, I found the film to be an incredible journey. Its universal appeal made it accessible, provoking both tears and laughter. As a documentary, it held me captive, and long after the credits rolled, I grappled with emotions, wishing I could call my dad. The film's straightforward approach illuminated harsh truths about life and aging, leaving an indelible impact. It's more than a documentary; it's a personal reflection on profound aspects of existence. Undoubtedly, it's a cinematic gem I'll revisit, finding solace in its poignant narrative and reliving the emotional rollercoaster.",False
5,10,A true masterpiece.,skagerlindmalin,n/a,16/08/2025,"With warmth, love, laughter and sorrow this documentary shows the complexity when generations age and how they react on the changes.A true love story between a father and his son and between friends. A story that gives both hope and despair.The interaction between father and son and between the two friends (Filip Hammar and Fredrik Wikingsson) is genuine and empathetic.Authentic story with no acting, just real life. The beauty of France is included and it's a pleasure to see the views.Strong, colourful and emphatic creation that shows how turning back time can be both painful and hopeful at the same time.",False
6,10,Will win an Oscar for best foreign movie,manvret,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's an absolute masterpiece. What a gem of a movie. Tears, laughter, bitterness, kindness and everything between. Made me look at aging and retirement from many new angles. What a journey. It's also very well put together, the flow of the movie is just spot on, the cutting room really outdid themselves this time. It's for sure the best Swedish movie ever made and, for me, it was the best movie of all time. My guess is it will just blow the competition away at next year's Oscars, since it's Swedish. I guess it can ""only"" win the category for best foreign movie. Might be wrong here tho? Anyway, it's a must-see.",False
7,10,Beautiful portrait of life,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film is, indeed, one of the better films of the year. Filip and Fredik has proved themselves to be creative before, but this film really cements their provice in the directorial department. This is both an incredible documentary, drama and overall outlook at life.It is expertly cut and paced, and indeed exquisitly cinema worthy - very much feature quality, and truly the work of masters. The film features som stellar imagery and clever cutting and editing.The heart of the film, however, is what really drives it - it is both funny, very emotional and a low key, somber outlook at life. Extremely moving.Overall, definitely an incredible and lovely film about aging, embracing what you have and appreciating the small things in life!",True
8,6,"Good foundation, execution lacking.",spaijkull-26524,n/a,16/08/2025,"My expectations were quite high after reading some reviews, but also from the duos own constant promotions for it in their podcast which became ""a bit"" much. As a podcast listener for many years, I am quite well informed about Filips family - including his fathers situation.In many ways it was a nice idea for a film and it's hard not to feel with Lars's situation. I think he's a wonderful man. I do however agree with one of the reviewers it feels a little forced. Many scenes did not need Filip showing the audience how we should feel. I don't doubt that Filip loves his father and that he wants the best for him, but some of his rather forced emotions just ruins the moment for me. I fully get that it is movie and not a documentary - but this mix didn't really work for me personally. I don't understand how it can review so highly - perhaps it's just me that's odd.The good thing is that Filip/Fredrik can donate a large part of their proceeds from this film. It is a large financial success with relatively low production costs, An idea would be to causes related to aging or elderly in Sweden getting better care and opportunities. THAT would squash any views about this feeling a little opportunistic. It would also be more in line with their political ideology and views, something that they share freely in their podcast. I'm not holding my breath.",False
9,10,I didn't expect this,simonsr-47663,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen, and the first time that I have given a top rating to a movie.Even the day after watching it, it made me shed tears just thinking about some parts of it. There is something very genuine and good about Lars. He is a person with a pure heart, and you can clearly see it in this movie. It's hard to see a person like Lars come to age even for a stranger, so seeing Filip's frustration about the situation makes me understand him a lot, and feel empathy for both of them.I have been a fan of Filip and Fredrik for a long time and always appreciated their work, but still I didn't expect this at all. This one is a masterpiece.",False
10,10,A beautiful masterpiece that everyone should watch.,VeggieVader,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a 31-year-old Swedish man. I have seen many TV programs that Filip and Fredrik have made and it is always about humor. In this film you get to see a new side of them that I haven't seen before, especially Filip. A very caring, kind and empathetic side that touched me deeply.Filip's father has become depressed and lost his zest for life. Filip and Fredrik take him on a drive to France to relive old memories and hopefully rekindle his zest for life. I have struggled with depression in my life and know how terrible it is, and can therefore relate to a lot of what Filip's father is going through.There is so much love in this movie. It shows the love between a father and his son. It's heartwarming and heartbreaking, optimistic and pessimistic and funny but serious, at the same time. It really shows the importance of living in the present, to appreciate life and each other, but also to appreciate the life you had and all the memories.My head hurt after the movie ended because I cried so much. One of the most important and moving films I have seen. A beautiful masterpiece that everyone should watch.",False
11,4,Who's journey is it really?,tha_hawk,n/a,16/08/2025,"The famous swedish duo Filip Hammar and Fredrik Wikingsson decide to bring Filip's father on a trip to restore his will to live. But what on the surface seems like an admirable mission soon reveals itself as another opportunity for the duo to showcase themselves. Filip is more concerned with reliving the golden years of his childhood rather than finding out what his ageing dad is interested in. As producers/directors Hammar and Wikingsson edit the material to invent situations that doesn't really exist and they prefer constructed drama to actually painting the portrait of Hammar's father, present and past. The consequence is that you start questioning the motives and ethics behind this documentary. Den sista resan might be entertaining but it's not an honest story.",False
12,10,A movie full of joy and happiness,kentrahmn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie. The film has been in the theaters for a while. The film will be Sweden's Oscar contribution to the Oscars in 2025. Normally I do not like Filip and Fredrik, they are very loud and rowdy on their shows on TV. Figured I'd at least give it a chance, so I'll went and checked it out. My God, what a surprise I got. A film that is so moving with so much joy, laughter, tears and pure emotional experience. Got completely warm in the heart. I am so glad I went and watched the movie. I'm afraid to repeat myself, but this movie is probably the best movie I've seen this year. Have seen so many good movies this year. 2024 is a successful year for film indeed. You feel happy in the soul to walk out of the cinema with a big smile on your face. Enjoy, laugh, cry and feel the joy after watching this movie. This experience was worth every second of the movie. Watch the movie now.",False
13,10,An intimate and very personal story,lennartengelbert,n/a,16/08/2025,"As real life reality documentaries go, this is a real gem.Filips father Lars, who is elderly and depressed, is treated to a 'last trip' to his beloved France by his son.Using recordings from the past, super-8 films mixed with reality-style captures we are taken on an emotional father-son journey on multiple levels.You have the actual trip but also the emotional journey taken by Filip and his father. We can se the love between a father and a son, and we can see how the son becomes the father, as the father becomes the son.Lars slowly awakens and for the first time in many years, starts to live again.This is a heart warming and beautiful story that is rare and it reminds us what family is, or can be.",False
14,9,Can't we stay a little longer?,matronix-12345,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe closing statement of the movie. That phrase applies to both my feelings for this film, but also to life in general. The central message in this story is to just live out your life. Lars Hammar, according to the story, lived by this ""rule"". But has now lost track on who he really is.The journey doesn't come without complications. Early on we see Lars get injured, not being able to continue. And it makes one think, is this really it? The journey continues to throw the viewer between hope and despair until the magnificent moment where Lars old students sends a personal message, thanking him for what he has done throughout the years. And I can guarantee that not a single eye was drye. I have seen this movie multiple times and it manages to bring out the same emotion in me everytime. A wonderful story founded by a sons love for his father. Ending in a motivation for everyone to see the good things in life and proving that it is never too late for anything. An uniquely touching story that everyone should witness and absorbe.",True
15,8,Beautiful movie,Milanovel,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautiful movie about Fredrik who brings his aging father back to France, his second country. Fredrik recreates scenes from the past to help his father get his spirit back. It's sad and moving from both Fredrik and Lars perspectives. You see the little boy who wants his young father back, and the old man who knows his time is running out. You can feel their pain. As a move it's well composed: the mix of realism, the music and the scenes. Fredriks attempts to recreate his father's past are heartbreaking, and heartwarming. I was really moved and I still think about it from time to time. Time is ruthless.",False
16,10,An incredibly beautiful and moving film,hennigiit,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I loved the strength of the characters as shown through their words, deeds, and silent looks. The caat was really talented.So often the hard stuff in life isn't addressed in film in a careful way that honours the pain and acknowledging the trauma. I left feeling like parts of me were seen but I also didn't feel traumatised by the way they told the story.Post quake Christchurch was a powerful setting, the city and collective grief and trauma was like a powerful background character. I also loved seeing Samoan culture shine brightI think overseas audiences will also connect to the story..",False
17,9,An excellent gem which shows how to do more with less.,YARDCG,n/a,16/08/2025,"This Swedish work is a thoughtful exploration of how our lives are shaped by some of the earliest adult experiences, which become habits, then warm memories - and then ever-fading memories. In this case, the retired teacher Philip Hammar was lucky enough to have a loving son so committed to the best of times they shared together so as to set up the titular Last Journey and re-ignite these memories again - even as we get to see how Sisyphean that quest often is.After all, it was Herodotus who is claimed to have said over 2,000 years ago that you cannot enter the same river twice - and too often, Lars Hammar is forced to discover that the best of his intentions crash into the reality of his father's inexorable decline. The moments where his plans to contrive the beloved moments from his father's past into existence once again largely succeed become all the more precious for every heartbreaking time they fail to work as intended. In the end, it works more often than not - but it's an open question if that would have been the case for a person who lived a less simple, honest life then Phillip Hammar. After all, the most heartwarming moment is ultimately not a recreation of any individual thing he did, but the video of his former students getting together to record their best wishes years and decades after he last taught them - as good a moment as any to reflect that it is what we do for the other people which often defines us and persists the longest.If there's anything this film can be said to be blind to, it's how rare an opportunity like that of a Hammar's family still is in today's world. I am glad Lars was able to do what he did, but it's fair to say that the absolute majority of us humans still live in places and conditions where even such ""lower middle-class"" goals as what he did remain decisively out of reach. Moreover, it's an open question if what Lars was able to pull off COULD ever be made available to everyone who wishes to do so (and whose parents live long enough to make this matter, of course), or if it'll forever remain a privilege for those of us lucky to live in the societies stable and comfortable enough to enable it. It's certainly a very hard question to tackle in a film like this, but if it managed to do so, I would have unreservedly declared it an all-time masterpiece. For now, I'll only go as far as to say it is a very good film and you ought to see it.I would also like to note it's quite well-directed in technical terms as well - soundtrack choices, use of camera techniques, etc. Are all pretty good. (The one instance later in the films where multiple frames are interpolated may not be all that complex, but it's rarely something you see in a documentary like this, and it works.)",False
18,3,Awkward display of self-importance,bartverberne16,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had no pre-existing knowledge on the makers of this film or on its background, so i came into this completely neutral.However, early on in the story i got annoyed with the self-important attitude of the son and his friend, who are pressurizing an aging man to relive the past. Leave him be, for f sake! The 'laat journey', and in particular the staging of memories to relive the past, is mostly to their own fullfillment than that it is for Lars Hammar. The vegetable cutting scene towards the end was particularly grueling. Finally, there, the son self reflects and comes to the conclusion he pressurized his father perhaps a bit too much. I appreciated that, but that he didn't understand this much earlier on is just plain stupid.The makers of this film should've kept this a private project. Why is it important to share this with the world? What makes them, or this story, so important to show it to the world? There are millions of us that struggle with similar if not more dramatic and interesting stories involving aging family members. I now gather that the makers of this film are themselves famous in Sweden, but honestly, that makes matters far worse.",False
19,2,So sad,lasseman59,n/a,16/08/2025,"Uh...okay!Must admit, have always had a bit of a hard time with these 2...Filip and Fredrik. Became known early on for not performing anything. Started with Ursäkta Röran and then it has been ground on with High Chaparall etc. Of course aroused the interest of the younger ones, everything a bit clumsy. But of course the self-confidence of both of them rose...this works! After all, we also get prizes, for producing...nothing.Just drive, we take the opportunity to also throw crap at others in the establishment for open curtain. How ill-conceived it may be.You also end up there with the documentary (hardly a documentary) The Last Journey.The whole story feels so well-directed and inauthentic that it suggests.The whole thing becomes quite tragic to see in its entirety. Also tragic to see Lars Hammar act, without even knowing how he acts. Only he listens to what he is told...to act. We want that tear-jerking sequence on film, no matter the cost.Must feel genuine, however inauthentic it may be.Because Filip and Fredrik want more prizes and for people to applaud, pay tribute to them, shout BRAVO.For something that is nothing more than a tragic story.The quest for more fame has crossed a new threshold.Too bad about Lars Hammar.",False

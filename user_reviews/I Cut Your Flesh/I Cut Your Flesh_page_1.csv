1,5,A Barely Interesting Documentary,perfectx-71415,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary consists of a girl whose addiction to body scarification and BDSM. It starts out well enough to be honest as you get to see a lot of the body play in extreme detail. But to me the problem lies that as much that does happen also nothing happens. It just becomes kinda boring after awhile. Now I'm not saying this documentary is bad, maybe it's just not for me considering I'm not really into the scene. I will say it's impressive the amount of pain this girl goes to. I just wish there was a little more meat on the bones of this documentary like some stories or revelations about the participants or some real whacked out extremities that this movie may have not touched. Either way big your into this world you'll probably enjoy this. As for me this is one I could've skipped.",False
2,6,Little Bleeders - Average Documentary,ninjaalexs,n/a,16/08/2025,"There seems to be a proliferation of BDSM themed documentaries and to be honest I will watch them all.I Cut Your Flesh starts off with a heavy metal song and has a logo that wouldn't be out of place on a gig poster. The documentary is shot in HD and looks good. Subject wise it features the blood play and cutting style of BDSM. As you would expect there are many graphic shots of knife play including cutting with a scalpel, needles being inserted and piercing (nipple and back). I think this film would struggle to pass at 18 in the UK if it were to be submitted to the BBFC. BDSM films have always been a bit of a bete noire for them with films like The Story Of O Part II and A Caning For Miss Grainger being banned back in the day.It's a fairly interesting documentary, but it feels more like something you would see on YouTube, if they would allow it. I'm not doubting the talent of the director who has directed many BDSM themed horror films and the passion and willingness of people like Sox to appear on film is admirable. The documentary has limited appeal people in the scene will probably be familiar with most of it and people who are viewing it as an educational piece will probably turn it off quickly. I found it a bit meh.",False

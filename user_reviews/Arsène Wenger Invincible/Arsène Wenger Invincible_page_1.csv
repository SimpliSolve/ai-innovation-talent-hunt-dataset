1,8,"Really liked it, but something was missing.",TreeFiddy53,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of those docs that you keep the rivalries aside for and watch it for Arsène and the work he's done at Arsenal.If you watch football, you should watch this - but it doesn't really have anything you already may not know. It's well made and offers some perspective from other legends on Arsenal's glory days under Wenger and the downfall after moving out of Highbury.I did feel like there was something missing though. I thought Balon's doc on The Invincibles had SO MUCH more content. This doc was supposed to be that and then some more because this is about Arsene and The Invincibles are only a part of this journey. The doc really kicks off about halfway in, after his declaration to go undefeated but until then, I thought they missed the opportunity to say so much more about him and his journey prior to ARS. They do touch upon it but I thought there would be more. Compare this against Fergie doc with content prior to the treble, the storytelling was so much better.But, regardless, by the end of the doc, you leave with more respect for the man and some life lessons for folks to takeaway. Respect and credit where it's due!",False
2,8,Mostly Caviar but doesn't forget the Sausages,CaviarandSausagesBook,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler95 minutes is obviously not enough to cover a 22-year reign so the film focuses on the Invincibles season interspersed with Wenger's early life and coaching career, arrival in London and departure. So there's no mention of the 2005 Champions League Final, the 2007/08 Eduardo leg-break and title heartbreak, and much more. Notable are:The old footage (including some behind the scenes stuff I'd not seen before) and stories of Wenger's arrival and early years at Arsenal, including a shamefully xenophobic and nasty welcome from some of the British public and media.Legends like Vieira, Henry, Pires and Wenger himself rewatching and reliving the big moments from the Doubles, Invincibles and Battle Royale with Man Utd. As an Arsenal these were spine-tingling but most neutral fans will enjoy some of these classic moments.Respect to Alex Ferguson for being very generous with his praise of Wenger; the rivalry was bitter back in the day, but there is now mutual respect.Balanced - I expected it to be more one-sided but Dixon, Keown, Wright and others weren't afraid to point out Wenger's failings in the Stage Two and Three eras.Loyalty - the respect from players like Vieira, Henry and Petit is clear to see.Wenger - the first time I've seen him suggest he stayed too long and (maybe with the benefit of more time passing his departure) he shows more introspection, warmth and humour than in last year's bland autobiography.Sadness at the way it ended, and some of the abuse he received.Key quote - ""We left our soul at Highbury"".",True
3,9,Arsène Wenger: Invincible,studioAT,n/a,15/08/2025,"A fascinating film about the legendary Arsenal manager, and my respect for him only increased after watching.It perhaps would have been nice to have had more time dedicated to things like the relief he felt after that famous 2014 FA Cup win, or the pain of the 2006 Champions League Final defeat, that really heralded the break-up of the Invincibles team.On the whole a lovely film though, and we'll be lucky to ever have a manager of his ilk again.",False
4,9,"Authority is not linked with age, its linked with personality and competence",koleary-122-921190,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you have read or even heard Wengers autobiography this is much of the same but with the adulation of both his friends and foes woven in. A man who could harness focus and control fear is revealed amongst some of the struggles that you may not already know.Interviews, even with Alex Ferguson are entwined with warmth and respect. While those close to him refer to him as a father figure he extends this measure to the viewer, letting them know that he should have left the club sooner. Unveiling the hurt they caused him but without evoking guilt and revealing his wounds in the most painless way possible. As any good father would.Adieu Arsene.",True
5,8,Fitting tribute to one of the greatest Managers,csm-78119,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is well done. It tells the tale of how this unique football personality transformed the English game, a journey which started in ridicule and disbelief but which along the way produced one of the greatest teams in Premier League history. The tributes from Sir Alex Ferguson were nice to hear and the filming in Alsace gave a real flavour of Arsene Wenger's background. The highlight of the piece though was his own narrative, from which real human decency and a fair amount of wisdom shine through.",False
6,6,Kinda seen it before,stevelomas-27685,n/a,15/08/2025,"Mostly uses footage from old season reviews with new interviews, no controversy moments really just a standard, this is how it was to what Wenger is doing now.",False
7,10,A legend of the game,fakhrur-41468,n/a,15/08/2025,"The guy who changed everything. For all the money in the English game today, the achievement remains unmatched. But more than this, a true football man who played the game in the right way and conducted himself with dignity, loyalty and class. An absolute classy gentleman and legend! Always was ahead of the game in his prime years as manager and changed the dynamic of the English game we all love. The invincible achievement...absolutely remarkable still to this very day, football from heaven and an absolute privilege to have witnessed!",False
8,9,A reminder of the good times,lookslikestevied,n/a,15/08/2025,"We all know the football stuff; the way Arsene changed the game, won the double, the Ferguson rivalry, the unbeaten campaign, move to the Emirates, and, despite calling his last 10 years a failure still qualifying for Champions League 9 of those years (!)......That aside, this is a well-made film, looks good and feels good. Fantastic cast of important people, excellent footage and a perfect homage to Arsenal's most successful and important manager.Nicely done.",False
9,8,"A Warm Hearted, Nuanced Portrait",david-meldrum,n/a,15/08/2025,"For a third generation Arsenal fan like myself, this is a soul lifting shot of liquid nostalgia; for anyone like me it's essential viewing, for those with an interest in English football beyond the strictly partisan it's similarly worthwhile. It's beautifully put together, and the format allows a more critical appraisal of Wenger than his own book; there's a nuance here that the book lacks. The final minutes of the film are unquestionably moving. What is strange is the scant attention given to Arsenal's trip to a Champions' League final. That aside, it's a great watch and captures much that's true about this uniquely focussed and influential football man.",False
10,8,Told Off by Sir Alex,GoldenGooner04,n/a,15/08/2025,"Tough watch for me this was, being am Arsenal Season Ticket holder for 38 years and counting.I was very surprised that the Champions League Final was not mentioned.Lots of Great memories come flooding back of Highbury and bad memories of the 99 Semi-Final I was there.The shots of him in the tunnel before the Burnley game was of him looking pretty angry, he blames US the fans for wanting him out.But what he said is the truth ""Arsenal lost their SOUL when they left Highbury.He won't go back to the Emirates as their are no happy memories, Highbury was the love of his life as it was for all of us.I was pleased to see Sir Alex having a lot to say, and was surprised when he said ""that going a whole season unbeaten"" was bigger then anything he had done, Really the Treble?But was great to see the Respect he has for Arsene and he blames us the fans for getting rid of him. Sorry Sir Alex but in 2014 we had Klopp lined up, but Wenger would not leave. We should not have given him a new contract.It's strange to watch Arsenal and Man U Rule English football, now look at us. Man U starting yet again after sacking Ole, Fergie left Man U in 2013 that's 8 years ago, and Wenger left in 2018.It's not easy to replace 2 of the Greatest Managers that ever lived.",False
11,9,Shows the true stories of Arsenal's success,jackbanks-83266,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary shows a great insight on what life was like at Arsenal Football Club during the invincible season. It really shows how good of a team Arsenal were, it also shows how good Arsène and the players they had were. You can tell by the way it's directed that the team's chemistry was out of this world and that they worked extremely well together. Watching this documentary made me realise that the players that had (Henry, Viera, Pires etc) made the ball look like it was stuck to their feet, at many points they were also like magicians. Arsenal had world class, magic, spectacular players who worked exceptionally well together at this point in time.",False

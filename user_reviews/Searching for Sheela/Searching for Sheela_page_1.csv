1,5,Nothing new,Calicodreamin,n/a,15/08/2025,Boring documentary on the return of Sheela to India that succeeds in adding nothing new to the story. Instead Sheela goes on a press tour all the while complaining that the media only asks the same questions. Not worth the hour.,False
2,3,The 'Search for Sheela' still continues!,arastuz,n/a,15/08/2025,I tried very hard to watch it but couldn't beyond a while. It's an elitist showpiece of Sheela's first trip to India in 35 years. Shakun Batra tries hard to 'balance' things out by showing historic footage but fails as this film is shot with Sheela's permission and is pretty much her mouthpiece. She's evidently a megalomaniac and believes that 'Life is a performance' (she says it as well).The 'Search for Sheela' still continues!,False
3,4,"Completely redundant, lacking motive and barely engaging",nivedita-mehta,n/a,15/08/2025,"This doco probably intended initially to cash in on the Wild Wild Country series success
However if you were considering watching this because you had many unanswered and legitimate questions don't bother because it's not to be found here or even explored.There is one moment that to me came close to getting an insight into this person but that was fleeting and rare.",False
4,1,Are you kidding me??,marianomasvidal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Superficial and boring.Now Netflix tries to show this horrible person as a nice old lady who did nothing wrong.She travels to India after 35 years and she is received as a hero and an inspiration. This is very sad because she hurt many people and she is really evil and sadistic.She was supposed to be in jail for 20 year and served only 3, of course...she is a rich thief.She stole a lot of money she is a corrupted millionaire living in Europe.Do not waste your time, find the truth in the original documentary.",False
5,1,Criminally Bad.,gonsalvessinclair,n/a,15/08/2025,"Do not waste your time with this one.The storytelling is probably the worst that I've even seen from a Netflix documentary. Poorly scripted, looks like it was put together by an amateur. The interviews were shallow with a focus only on her scandals.Absolutely shocked to see this get released, honestly, it was THAT bad.",False
6,1,Sheela is chilling with page 3 personalities,mikhilsaluja,n/a,15/08/2025,"What crap is this. Random page 3, Bollywood, fashion possibilities come together and click selfies and ask same redundant questions. Dressed in fancy clothes.This is not a documentary. But a travel or trip to india video of hers.",False
7,1,Such a waste!,leena-47675,n/a,15/08/2025,I had been looking forward to this! After watching the documentary I had such high hopes. But this looks like a kitty part being shot by a beginner! No content whatsoever.Karan Johar your production house produces most boring content. FYI.,False
8,1,Rajkumar Hirani made Sanju for Sanjay Dutt,harishkhollam,n/a,15/08/2025,Absolutely thrash. All you can see is how the higher upper class live their life lavishly. Showcasing her fame and her thoughts. Totally hyped because of wild wild country on Netflix. A person in denial.,False
9,1,Terrible. A big step down from Wild Wild Country,hisxlnc,n/a,15/08/2025,Watching this garbage after the absolutely brilliant Wild Wild Country is like eating week old left leftovers after having a five course meal in a nice restaurant. Netflix should have let the original producers make this documentary as well.,False
10,2,Self-absorbed nonsense,claddagh72,n/a,15/08/2025,"The title of this documentary is the most revealing thing about the film. The makers are searching for Sheela, but, trust me, they never find her. As she goes on a press junket (back to her native India for the first time in 35 years,) to presumably answer questions about her life, she gets irritated that she gets asked questions ABOUT HER LIFE.As she is shown in the far superior Wild, Wild Country documentary, Sheela continues to be a world-class manipulator in her old age. She gaslights those who want to know if she committed past crimes, and why, by calling those who raise such questions ON A PRESS TOUR, boring. Without a trace of irony, she tells these journalists and her oddly adoring groupies that they need to look inside themselves so they can ask better questions.The filmmakers don't bother to call Sheela on her BS, either with direct questions or by virtue of the documentary's construction. Fact checking is needed because Sheela never saw a fact that didn't have an interpretive story. Some differing points of views are needed as well. What does her family think of Sheela today? Former cult members? Law enforcement? Instead, what we get are fawning ""journalists"" apologizing and laughing for the questions they've asked, and taking Sheela's wrath for even asking them. Then there's the crowds of young people falling all over themselves to get a moment with Sheela, because she's apparently some kind of celebrity to be worshipped. Why? Before going to India, Sheela thought she would be killed there and needed security. But instead she gets groupies. That's never explored either. This whole documentary comes across like a Sheela-produced PR puff piece.",False
11,1,The glorification of an evil woman,todd-ramirez,n/a,15/08/2025,What total rubbish. She destroyed the lives of thousands. How can anyone be starstruck with her? She should have served all 20 years of her sentence.,False
12,1,Extremely bad,souravray-kol,n/a,15/08/2025,Glorification of criminals are usual practice in bollywood. Worst documentary in Netflix.,False
13,1,Just publicity for her book,spideybatman,n/a,15/08/2025,Horrible demonstration of her life after the court cases. It's her word against nobody else's because the other party's dead.This is a mere publicity documentary for her book. Please avoid.,False
14,1,Looks like a HiFi Kitty Party,sumitkv,n/a,15/08/2025,"Horrible! No insights hence cannot be called a documentary, its a show for selling books and stuff. If you want to know both sides of the story watch Wild Wild West which is an actual documentary.There are scenes in this movie where it looks like an actual kitty party/ wine and dine.",False
15,1,Watch if you want to delete one hour of your life,roydonb-20029,n/a,15/08/2025,"Give me one hour of my life back. After what Wild Wild Country was in terms of story telling, you would expect this to be atleast good if not the best. Let me put it this way, this was fake, pretentious and bizarre and people who made this don't have friends because if they showed this to their real friends, this would have never released. The Director needs to stop directing anything, the DOP needs to sell of his camera and the script writer if there was any should maybe become a cook or do something different.",False
16,1,Terrible,betul_ayberkin,n/a,15/08/2025,Is this sponsored by Sheila herself? She is a ruthless criminal but has this opportunity to to lie about her crimes.It's really wrong to give her such voice. I could only watch 10 minutes of this unbelievably low quality show.,False
17,1,Not worth a watch,abhinavmarda,n/a,15/08/2025,Very pretentious and misleading. Sheela is on a spree to ask people to view the poisoning incident from her angle. But I couldn't buy what she had to say.,False
18,2,I wasted 30 minutes so you don't have to,dcreal-75942,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a terrible documentary or whatever you want to call it. It literally provided nothing of value. First, why was she afraid to go back to India? Second, this was a bunch of people sucking up to her, because Indians are always sucking up to anyone famous in the west. Third, she is barely famous. Skip it.",False
19,2,Just a waste documentary,opotraining,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched it after watching wild wild country. There is nothing in this documentary. Same clips of wild wild country is shown. She is giving interviews to everyone and doesn't say anything. Always it's a mystery. She doesn't reveal anything about her time in jail, about bagwan. Just skip this.",False
20,2,"Dull, meandering and fake",walterico,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are some matters of fact about Sheela's involvement in Rajneeshpuram with Osho / Baghwan, but you won't find them being addressed here. The odd thing is that a clearly angry Osho is quoted repeatedly making clear his denunciation of Sheela as a cheat, liar and criminal, while Sheela blithely speaks about her devotion and love for him, never dealing with the substance of his statements.A search for redemption is just about the only motive she can have for seeking this amount of attention, 35 years on. She certainly doesn't want to set the record straight, or answer the ""insufferable"" questions about her crimes.She was a charismatic, angry, funny and efficient leader back in the 80's, who loved to rile the rednecks of Oregon who opposed the very notion of Rajneeshpuram in their State. She's now a shadow of her former self with nothing to say. Sad and boring.",False
21,1,Such a waste of time for watching Ma sheela.,snehalkurup,n/a,15/08/2025,This could have been the best documentary anyone could have made. But Karan Johan and Shakun Batra ruined it for us. There was soo much expectations and o would say it was not even worth any part of it. You guys could have just made the most epic doc but as usual u know how to ruine a good content.The worst part was the journalist asking the lamest question to the most powerful women who build an entire town all by her vision and passion and the love for one person. I guess any other director could have done a better job than then.Thanks again for ruining it for us.Great going guys.,False
22,1,"Plain simple BS, Feels like a cheap attempt to rebut Wild Wild Country.. Netflix India ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž ..",weslyraji-28883,n/a,15/08/2025,"It would have been worth the watch if the creators take her back to US and do the same there specially in Oregon and Wasco. Then it could have been called a ""Documentary""",False
23,1,Wasting time and money -BAKWAS,shibendradas,n/a,15/08/2025,"No point,
No logic
Worst writing
Worst direction
Direction less story
Fooling people
Wasting time and money.",False
24,1,Complete BS,atulduttca,n/a,15/08/2025,Women with so much arrogance and false pride in her young age and now looking for redemption. The way she interacted with people when she was younger completely contradict her personality. Simple chronic lies continues even at this age. Absolute waste of time.,False
25,1,Embarassing,divya-72860,n/a,15/08/2025,"A drooling eager group of PR women plan a schadenfruede bus tour while she gets to India and immediately shopping for clothes ! Her complex weirdness not explored at all, instead again Bollywood takes over and Johar with his gaudy smug bombay vibe interviews her. So bad could not complete it. From what I read it only gets worse.",False

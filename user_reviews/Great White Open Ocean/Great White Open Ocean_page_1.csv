1,10,Inspiring,Richardowen0611,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not your normal shark documentary and I have watched many. Never have I felt so emotional and touched by watching one. From the initial incident to the devastating after affects, this shows one persons passion and genuine love for these beautiful animals. Honestly a beautiful documentary with twists and turns unseen before in this genre. Respect and love to you Jimmy I know you will be in Guadalupe in 2023.",False
2,5,I'm just here to enjoy the Darwin Award contestants,waywarddrifters,n/a,16/08/2025,"You'll have to see it to believe it, but for as well filmed and produced as this is, one of the dumbest things you'll ever see humans do for television ratings is in this show. That said, it's so flipping funny that I can't hate on it. It makes me laugh audibly whenever I see it, and it is such a joy if you like watching a perfect example of where our culture has run afoul with Mother Nature. If you'd like to see what a lame and thoughtless animal we've become, make some popcorn and tune in to this chum-fest. If you're as cynical as I am, you'll laugh yourself senseless at what these fools try to do for the sake of tv ratings.",False
3,9,Beautifully unexpected,mpgqc,n/a,16/08/2025,This has some of the dramatic commercial cliff-hangers and repetitive narration but is overall an excellent account of shark-diving experts doing their thing. Shows the passion and respect scientists have for sharks when in the field (or the ocean). Beautiful and positive depiction of white sharks too!,False
4,1,Worst shark documentary ever,illustrationguru,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA guy who loves sharks puts himself in a flimsy plastic bin and is shocked that he is almost eaten by a shark. This film has nothing to do with sharks, don't waste your time.It feels like this film is made by teenagers who just heard about sharks and borrow their parents camera to go out and play with sharks like a drunken frat party.This film is more about how rich dumb people are talking all the good jobs. I've seen plenty of great shark documentaries, this is definitely not even considered a shark documentary.If you want to have fun watching this film, then count how many times they say the name jimmy, because that's who this film is about.",True
5,4,Everything is staged.,whitemale-21873,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt says documentary but this was clearly a movie. Jimmy was never sick, never had a stroke etc. Mabe you can call it drama comedy parody. They where all acting. Oh well.. it beats most reality tv series. There where some great acting as well, the writing could need some help. I guess AI can yelp now if it is necessary.My guess is that this is meant for adults but who knows, I dont. Its quite lame to have to fill the comment with meaningless phrases.Absolutely lame and silly idea..But there are some nice clips of great white sharks, if you are into that. I like that its short as well. Hope this helps.",True

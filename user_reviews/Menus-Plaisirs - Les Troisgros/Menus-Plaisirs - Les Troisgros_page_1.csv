1,8,Wiseman Strikes Again,peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"What makes Frederick Wiseman special, to me, is that Wiseman is able to craft documentaries and stories that examines through the perspectives of Cinéma vérité and is able to center and craft things with realism, heart, and soul of it's subject. This newest documentary is another banger. For a man who is in his 90s, still crafting well-crafted documentaries is quite the accomplishment and success.With every minute detailed explored within this four hour piece, each component felt genuine, interesting, and quite tasty to observe. Observing the nature landscapes and environment of a French restaurant with delicious food and items are a massive eye-catcher indeed.",False

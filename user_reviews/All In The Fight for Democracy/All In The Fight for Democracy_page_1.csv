1,8,an ugly history,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Stacey Abrams is a generational spokesperson, and may very well be the future of the Democrat Party. This despite being recently passed over as Joe Biden's running mate. Ms. Abrams is a producer on this film co-directed by Lisa Cortes (HIP HOP X FASHION, 2019) and Liz Garbus (nominated for 2 Oscars: WHAT HAPPENED MISS SIMONE, 2015 and THE FARM: ANGOLA, USA, 1998). She also appears on camera numerous times speaking to us about voter suppression - something which impacted her directly.The film provides an historical look at the different ways voters have been suppressed and elections manipulated over the years - dating back to 1789, when the film informs, only 6% of the population was eligible to vote: white male property owners. We hear from many historians, authors, politicians, and activists, yet it's Ms. Abrams who stands out. She takes us through her personal background and describes in detail the influence her parents had on her. We also learn much about the 2016 Georgia Governor's race, where Ms. Abrams faced off against Brian Kemp. In one of the more startling statistics, we are told that as Georgia Secretary of State, Mr. Kemp purged 1.4 million voters from the Georgia registry.A true history lesson on voter suppression is provided, with much of the lesson and commentary provided by Ms. Abrams and author Carol Anderson, who wrote the 2018 book, ""One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression is Destroying Democracy"". We also hear from others, including 88 year old Andrew Young, one of the leaders of the Civil Rights movement, and a former Mayor of Atlanta and former US Ambassador to the United Nations.So many aspects of United States elections are discussed, and these include the Reconstruction era after the Civil War, the 19th Amendment, President Lyndon Johnson and Voting Rights Act, Gerrymandering, Voter ID requirements, Poll taxes and literacy tests, and the landmark 2013 case, Shelby County v Holder, resulting in a US Supreme Court decision that has impacted voter access. We see clips of the 30th anniversary of the Walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, and it's clear Civil Rights and Voting Rights are forever bound.The documentary is important as it connects history with the modern day issues resulting in voter suppression. Ms. Abrams and Ms. Armstrong are vital voices on a topic that should have been laid to rest many years ago; yet as long as the thirst for political power exists, manipulation of the system will be attempted. So, it's important that every citizen understand how this happens and what to be aware of.",False
2,8,Read Critic Reviews,supermestizo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Obviously there are team sports being played in the reviews. Critics reviewed this perfectly. Although it's about Abraham's, the film did a great job of adding historic, factual info while also sprinkling 1st hand experiences of ppl affected by suppression.",False
3,8,Rotten & Corrupt...,Xstal,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unfair, undemocratic, biased, discriminatory, immoral, partisan, autocratic, oppressive; with a common denominator the world over - white middle aged and older men, who are the curse of freedom, truth and democracy (obvs. not all of them). They've been around a while, just search for 'A Rotten Borough' online to find out more.Being able to vote as a legitimate resident in any country should be as easy as going outside and holding up your arm. If your views are then reflected in representatives appointed through proportional representation, you have democracy. Break either of those rules and, as much as you'd like to think otherwise, you're under the control of others and, most likely, through men with the common attributes and characteristics previously alluded to - another one of them being they don't like your right to vote if you're not like them.",False
4,10,Must see for truly patriotic Americans,lareilsel,n/a,16/08/2025,Stop what you're doing and watch this. Never has a doc been more timely and vital.,False
5,n/a,"A important, powerful doc at election time.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The consequences of anybody here, not turning out and doing everything you can to get your friends, neighbors, family to turn out, the consequences of you staying home would be profoundly dangerous to this country, to our democracy."" Barack ObamaThat a particular party might like to suppress the votes of its opponents makes some sense in the winner-take-all mantra of any race, but that racial and ethnic suppression does happen is always a shock to those who believe the process of democratic election is sacrosanct. Directors Lisa Cortes and Liz Garbus' insightful documentary All in: The Fight for Democracy dispels any notion that America's elections are pure and unadulterated.As the centerpiece of this study that covers the history of election fraud and questionable practices up to 2020 in Wisconsin, the Stacey Abrams run for Georgia governor in 2018 best expresses the frustrations of Democrats who perceived the Republicans were throwing up roadblocks from difficult qualifying questions to delayed polls. Abrams fought to the bitter end with only a few thousand votes outstanding and her awareness that she would never win.Perhaps most dismaying is that Brian Kemp won by 25 K votes among 4 million while over 100,000 were disqualified for not having voted enough previous times. I am personally disappointed that my home state of Ohio has the same illogical suppression.Abrams' Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, won with the advantage of these ""hoops"" that minority voters had to jump through, often answering questions like ""Who is the clerk of the Superior Court?"" He was the Secretary of State in charge of the election process while running for governor, illegal in some states but not Georgia. Such obvious conflicts of interest throw negative light on elections everywhere. However, the co-directors show how voter suppression was common throughout the history of the ""Republic."" Progressives and moderates have been fighting to suppress the suppression for centuries.Early on this informative doc shows other manipulative tactics such as gerrymandering, poll taxes, and demands for government ids to keep away the poor, resulting in making the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments impotent legislation. What the doc does not do is to present a fair assessment by conservatives about why they favored the suppressive legislations. The other side should always be allowed to defend itself in even benign docs like this.If for nothing else, this important documentary emphasizes the need to vote early, check on the vote's being processed, and exalt in a flawed but fair election. We'll see.",False
6,7,Don't use ignorance as a crutch,mbpid,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film brings up a good question; Who should be able to vote. Is the film seemingly partisan, sure if you insist on a perspective where closed mindedness and the inability to change are cornerstones in your life. The film used current and historical data to argue a point, you don't have to agree with their side to acknowledge there is a problem. If changes to voting laws fall along political lines, shouldn't that be a red flag, and hopefully that flag contains 50 stars and 13 stripes.",True
7,10,Best one yet!,hatchbet,n/a,16/08/2025,This is the most informative piece out right now. Abrams succinctly shares the importance of making our voices heard. Her comprehensive presentation males it easy to understand how voters have been suppressed in previous years and how to avoid this happening in the future. May every vote count and every person be able to vote without interference.,False
8,7,Another well-made and relevant documentary about US politics,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"You could argue it's preachy, but it's preachy for a very good reason.While the presentation isn't too flashy either, this compellingly and coherently breaks down many of the current problems with the voting system in the USA, focusing on (but not always limited to) minority groups.I learnt a good deal from watching this, and the way it cut back and forth between historical events in the America's past regarding voting rights and what was happening in the present day was really well done.Great interviews, great editing, and great information. It's a little in terms of visuals and entertainment value, and some people are unfortunately going to remain unswayed by the arguments presented, but I thought it was a very good and extremely relevant documentary that's worth a watch in these trying times.",False
9,10,Fantastic documentary!,tonicecil,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a fantastic documentary, outlining the problems we face as a nation with voter suppression. The GOP knows the only way they continue to hold power is by stifling the voice of the Dem voter. Stacy is an amazing leader who fights tirelessly to ensure every American can vote!",False
10,2,Blah blah whine cry,laragi,n/a,16/08/2025,You can never believe what you see or hear as fact. Research people. Everything. Consider your sources seriously.,False
11,10,TRUTH TO TELL,rob-02771,n/a,16/08/2025,"Actually, Republicans are doing whatever they can to paint Stacy in a negative light and why? The answer is simple and easy. They do not want every vote to count. I am a 73 year old white male and i can tell you this; without Stacy we would have never even realized the extent of the voter suppression in this state and thanks to her efforts, Georgians are aware, educated, highly informed, and ready to meet the multiple challenges and hurdles the Republican SOS will throw at us. Just look at the primary in Georgia where hundreds had to sit or stand in line to vote, many in the rain, just to exercise their right to have their vote cast and counted. They stood in those lines for hours, not minutes and in the most inclement weather you can imagine. Close by, in the primarily Republican voting areas, there were no waits at all. The suppression is not new. It is just exposed for what it is now. But because of Stacy Abrams this suppression has had the effect of uniting Georgians of good will and and has motivated us beyond belief to meet every one of their tricks with a commitment to overcome every one of them and thanks to Stacy, we are ready.",False
12,10,A poignant and vital film for preserving democracy.,kristinmreid,n/a,16/08/2025,"The most important film of 2020. We are watching this happen in real time. It informs, inspires, and incites. Must see!",False
13,9,An informative explanation of the history of voting rights within the US.,kisuka-53568,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just a heads up that this documentary is currently being review-bombed currently across multiple platforms by bots and people who have not actually watched the documentary.This documentary is really well done. It goes over the entire history of the right to vote within the United States from beginning to current events. It goes over the right to vote for women and for African Americans. It also goes over the times when we have stepped backwards on that right, such as the Chinese exclusion act, that have caused harm to that right.It's an extremely eye opening documentary that tries to explain why the right to vote is something worth continually monitoring and continually fighting for to ensure fair and honest elections.Other people reviewing this documentary are trying to say it's biased in some way; I disagree. I think that it does a pretty good job at explaining suppression events that have happened and how it's a concern for anyone regardless of their political views. The events they show are wrong regardless of the party involved. The documentary tries to shine a light on that fact to encourage more people to use their right to vote.",False
14,10,Everyone should watch this film.,cjr99823,n/a,16/08/2025,Wonderful film that everyone should watch. If you have Prime Video you can watch it there. I highly recommend this film.,False
15,1,Biased approach.,thausler-205-135723,n/a,16/08/2025,With so many known facts and so many known details was one side story is only told. It's in the eyes of the Democratic party in the narrative of the Democratic state that pushes a narrative that cannot be confirmed. Both sides must be considered both sides point of view must come into play for an unbiased approach and point of view to be reached.,False
16,10,PATRIOTS NEED TO WATCH THIS!!!,vivamaliengus,n/a,16/08/2025,"As we draw closer and closer to the November election, this refresher course on American democracy and what's at stake in 2020 is a MUST SEE. Please gather every voting member of your household and watch it together, and encourage everyone you know to watch it too. Well worth your time!",False
17,1,Would rate this Zero if I could.....,CapStar362,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a resident of Georgia and someone who holds dearly the very rights she threatened to remove or suppress in some capacity, Stacey Abrams lost her chance against Governor Kemp on 4 major policies that all but the most urban of areas disagreed with.She has been on a warpath since then, with several false allegations and just downright dirty tactics. Whatever is in this documentary, don't believe all you hear. Do your own research and make up your own minds.She is definitely not Second Amendment friendly, nor was she about fair play on voting rights.She wanted to allow more ways to encourage cheating. In fact, its so interesting, that Georgia until just recently was actually SUBPAR in voting laws that other states made Georgia look shameful in integrity until last year new laws went into affect that make SURE its that much harder to commit voter fraud.Nearly all of the other Democratic states have 10 times the voting laws and securities until last year as Georgia did, you don't see those states complaining?",False
18,10,Democracy is fragile,interactbiz,n/a,16/08/2025,America was once labeled a democracy and it appointed itself leader of the free world. But democracy is defined as a system of government by the whole population. This documentary proves that powerful people in the USA believe the 15th amendment was a mistake and plutocracy is preferable to democracy.,False
19,10,A MUST SEE!!!!,karensocialjustice,n/a,16/08/2025,Best film I have ever seen. Accurate history. A must see!!!,False
20,10,Perhaps the most important film you will ever see.,halimamclaughlin,n/a,16/08/2025,It has never been more important to understand the mechanics of voter supression in this country. Never have we been facing a more important election. Stacy Abrams is heroic.,False
21,5,A documentary about the United States being a flawed democracy.,svenvoijen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm not an American citizen, nor am I familiar with the voting requirements of the United States. I did enjoy the historic parts of the documentary, but the part that focussed on the election between Stacy Abrams and Brain Kemp was not very convincing. It felt like a really one-sided story where Democrats are the good side and Republicans represent evil.",True
22,10,An American Hero,crizzardi-837-502243,n/a,16/08/2025,"After having the Gubernatorial election stolen from her by a corrupt system, Stacey Abrams has moved forward to help others and protect the vote for today and tomorrow. She is a true American hero.",False
23,3,Excuses for Stacey not winning!!!,sjkriz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This document has good points and brings light to problems, but this is all about why Stacey didn't win and blaming it on voter suppression, which is blown out of proportion. Mail-in voting will never work because it brings too much corruption.",False
24,10,Stacey is a REMARKABLE woman!,denamatheny,n/a,16/08/2025,She continues to work on leveling the playing field for all.,False
25,10,Ignore the 1 star reviews.,jamesdaly-10321,n/a,16/08/2025,"Chances are they didnt even watch the film. Very informative, showing the insides of a dirty world. People will call it liberal lies because they are so brainwashed by the far right ideals, they cant admit facts when they see it. It's clear that gard work and painful insight was added to the film and its definitely worth the experience.",False

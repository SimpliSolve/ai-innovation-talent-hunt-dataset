1,10,Nail on the head,katiemsummers-10689,n/a,16/08/2025,"They hit the nail on the head with this one. MLM's are all predatory but the LuLaRoe owners were the worst!! Blame everyone for their issues, and lie out their asses.",False
2,1,LulaRoe or Socialism?,hanarothenberg,n/a,16/08/2025,"While it's very important to warn people (men AND women) of the dangers of MLM, this production almost undoes much of the progress made by the anti-MLM movement by bringing in a society-blaming angle. You're going backwards. Capitalism is not bad. Universal basic income doesn't work. This is gaslighting at best...MLMs target every living being with a pulse, not just SAHMs. Take away LulaRoe and this is just a documentary about Marxism. Skip skip skip-watch Amazon's LulaRich or many of the YouTube anti-MLM creators instead.",False
3,9,Shocking,thedivinewoman,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was briefly on a Walt Disney World messageboard and on Twitter mainly for tweets on Disney and I was bemused by the number of people talking about this brand of leggings, especially how amped up they would be about getting a new pair delivered to them or the latest look. I'm too fat for leggings so I was never tempted.So, naturally I was interested in seeing this documentary and all I can say is I was shocked by the tactics of this company and that it was actually a pyramid scheme. It's a well done documentary and an eyeopener. I would recommend anyone trying to make a quick buck from any company like this to watch it. The only people who profit are those at the top and they are a very small number of people.Recommended viewing.",False
4,1,Racebaiting garbage,bloodfalcon64,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yeah lularoe was a scumbag company that manipulated unwitting people into selling not just shoddy but also grotesquely hideous leggings, but the people who made this ""documentary"" are way worse than anyone who ran lularoe. It doesnt take long for the racists who made this to clumsily make the problem with lularoe about how the organization mostly comprised white women. Were they upset blacks and asians werent also getting exploited? Skip this racist marxist trash.",False
5,10,Well Done Documentary,cbhandfield,n/a,16/08/2025,Well done documentary on the problems with Lularoe and the MLM industry. Hope we see more calling out even more MLM companies and there's hope that a day will come that these predatory companies will no longer succeed at taking advantage of people while they get richer.,False
6,9,a fascinating subjective antagonistic story...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"About how to make a dime out of a dollar and leave the rest to the brand administers at the top, or said in other words join the pyramide scheme to try to feel the gain or pain or shame of success. And its all about slick fitting garmebts made to please an already overwhelmed market of fabrics retail. The introduction that is given to you is that youre gonna get rich in no time, just until the market is fed to the brim and everyone next door to you begs and pleads you to buy a new lularue, just the same as youre suicidingly desperate to sell outta your own home retail stock, and when the moment of no return hits you on the nose cause your greeding wish to become rich came to you far far too late... well thats the kinda documentary this is...clothes means nothing to me , i wear whatever ive at hand, but if youre involved in this geniously made scheme, have a look, and if youre interested in making easy money, cause the opportunity is still there, then have a peek cause its a devious crime that really will turn your life upside down whenever and most probably forever.Its just another social media driven hype that the grumpy old man would outta principles never let my wife into, and if your the spouce of a forthcoming buckmaker do whatever you can to stomp the madness. Therefore a recommend from the tgom.",False

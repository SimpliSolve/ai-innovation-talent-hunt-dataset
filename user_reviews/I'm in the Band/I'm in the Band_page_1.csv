1,10,What a feeling!,rebeckaflygare,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wrote and submitted a plot, and as it is not up yet I will now quote myself:
""The true story, openly told by the members, about the band who brought the harmonys, riffs and choirs into punk and garage rock. Words cannot describe all the ways they've influenced the music scene- shown in hundreds of offsprings trying to produce the same sound. The life of Hellacopters, and present and past members, is lively illustrated bringing laughter as well as tears.""
This music documentary is one that I will watch more than one time! Since Hellacopters have been one of my top three bands for over 20 years it would have been deeply disappointing with a badly done portrait- but Amir Chamdin and Johan Bååth have done an amazing job.",False

1,3,Time Waste !!,A-J2006_777,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Follow Karlo Yaar"" is a letdown because of how fake and made-up everything feels.The show doesn't seem real at all, with scenes that look more like they're scripted than showing actual moments from the influencers' lives. The so-called 'spontaneous' moments feel planned, and the dialogue sounds rehearsed. Instead of showing real, relatable stuff, the series is full of staged drama and forced situations.It ends up feeling like the show is trying too hard to grab attention, making it hard for viewers to genuinely enjoy or relate to it.To conclude, I would say not to watch this, it's just a sweet way to waste your time.",False
2,3,Keeping up with the DESI Kardashians,rjvyapari,n/a,16/08/2025,Everything is stolen from the Kardashians in Follow Karlo Yaar and it is so scripted..Looks like a replica of US based show.The sisters have obviously been told to keep fighting regularly on the show.... Even her business idea is taken from Skims - Kim's brand.... I actually only liked Asfi..... I hope she makes it big in Bollywood.... Uorfi is deluded and doesn't have humility..... My friends have loved her and think she is a badass but I feel she can be nicer to her sisters...... Especially urusa..... Dolly also needs to calm down a bit...... She is spunky but not everyone can become successful....,False
3,1,Trying to be Next Kardashians - she cant achieve 0.001% of Kardashians,mronline999,n/a,16/08/2025,"1st: Her behavior is questionable. If she desires the same level of respect and fame as Shah Rukh Khan, she should reconsider her actions. Despite claiming to disdain the paparazzi, she still relies on them for appearances. She should be more mindful of her position in the industry. While she may believe she is superior to other influencers, her content is often perceived as cringeworthy. She should remember the hard work and dedication it took for other stars like Shah Rukh Khan to achieve their success. If her arrogance continues, she should consider the potential consequences of a life less glamorous than Priyanka Chopra's.2nd: Her aspirations to become an entrepreneur are misguided. Entrepreneurship involves creating products or services that address people's needs or offer better alternatives to existing ones. Her current endeavors lack a clear understanding of market demand. While she may aspire to model for high-end brands, her audience is primarily accustomed to her extravagant and often frivolous fashion choices. Her career trajectory is largely defined by her appearances on television and Bigg Boss, and she has openly admitted that controversies and paparazzi attention have been instrumental to her success.Given her reliance on controversies and paparazzi, her career is likely to follow a similar path as other meme stars, as there will always be someone willing to outshine her. Her admission that no one wants to marry her, despite her desire for a traditional family life, highlights her addiction to fame, regardless of its source.At a relatively young age, she has resorted to cosmetic procedures that are more commonly associated with older celebrities like Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. Her appearance without makeup reveals a more ordinary face, even compared to her sisters. This documentary serves as a cautionary tale about the pursuit of fame and success at any cost. While it may be tempting to take shortcuts, the long-term consequences can be detrimental.Ultimately, her content is often perceived as cringeworthy and a waste of time.",False
4,9,Hard working girl!,vishprime,n/a,16/08/2025,"She looks like a hard working girl ! I think we should admire that ! Its a good clean watch ! Its the reality of india, so many such families around !

5,7,Worth watching if you want to get the idea of influencing world,jjendsouza,n/a,16/08/2025,"While the Javed family's drama might be a bit over the top, the series does offer an intriguing glimpse into the life of a famous influencer. It highlights the reality that influencers can't always make their own choices-everything from outfits to actions often requires approval from PR teams and agencies.Urfi, without a doubt, is a fierce and passionate individual. Her approach to money and fame may not resonate with everyone, and her methods for going viral have garnered mixed opinions. However, it's clear that there's more to her than just controversy. She's ambitious, hardworking, and talented-qualities that have helped her stay relevant online for nearly half a decade.The family drama could have been toned down, but given that the Indian audience enjoys some ""masala,"" it's understandable. Overall, I'd say the series is worth a binge-watch-certainly better than shows like Bigg Boss or Splitsvilla.",False
6,8,Worth watching,palsraviki,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this movie because it shows a great journey of a woman who works hard to achieve her dreams. What I liked most was the effort she puts in and her strong attitude toward making money. She doesn't give up, no matter how tough things get, and that really inspired me.The movie does a good job of showing how determined the main character is. You can feel her passion in everything she does, and it makes you want to cheer her on. Even when things don't go her way, she keeps pushing forward with a positive attitude. This makes her character feel real and relatable.I love how the movie shows her journey in a simple and down-to-earth way. It's not just about making money but also about her passion for what she does. You can tell that she really cares about her work, which makes the story even more enjoyable to watch. The movie doesn't make things easy for her, but it shows how hard work can pay off in the end.Overall, this film is a great reminder that with effort and a strong will, you can achieve your goals. It's not just a story about success; it's a story about dedication and passion, which makes it worth watching. If you like movies that focus on personal growth and never giving up, this one is for you.",False

9,9,Fresh and raw!,thesassywedding,n/a,16/08/2025,"Was initially skeptical to watch thinking its just another scripted show, but got hooked to it from the first episode itself. It is a full on entertainment show. Uorfi proves why she is without any doubt the biggest viral sensation on the internet. She looks raw & authentic without any filters in this show. With all the family drama, it is a desi version of keeping up with the kadarshains. With so much details about her personal and professional life, you will not get bored at any point. In all its a perfect binge watch show, full of drama, comedy and lighted hearted moments. Already looking forward to season 2 of the series.",False
10,10,Deeply Layered and Insightful,ishwarchavan-63135,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved the show. This is not a rip off of Kardashians. The show had depth and it was all about loving your twisted family. This is how families are - woh garha Bharte rehte hain. Every family under the surface has issues they don't talk about. This family verbalises it. I loved the family, the sisters and my favourites are Sahel and Asfi. They are #couplegoals. I hope they stay intact. But I feel that Sahel should do a regular job and keep his sanity. I cried in the end when she wore clothes by Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla. I felt like I had lived her struggle. I hope there is a Season 2. PS - urusa should marry khalid.",False
11,10,Woman empowerment,lhamopinku,n/a,16/08/2025,".to watch this show you have to completely left go of your personal prejudice about how Urfi is. It's an everyday struggle and story of a family or a woman who is trying her best to be the best in the world filled with ""star kids"".she show cases how strong she tries to be despite her wrong reasons for chasing fame and money. But isn't that all we want? This is what deferentiates ordinary people like and people like Urfi who has a zeal and is not altered by people's wrong opinion about her. Her anger issues and emotional issues are way out of proportion but he's also battling that herself. I personally loved the way she is.",False

14,10,A Star Is BORN - A Mega Star,SkySailBark,n/a,16/08/2025,"To be a successful celebrity and an actor/performer, you must be Human. A Human is not perfect and is full of faults, contradictions, suppositions, lies, truths, fears, and triumphs.A True Human is a MIRROR of society.Urfi Javed, of all 25 Years, is a clean and shining mirror to our society. She is an innocent child who will speak her mind, dance with joy, cry with rain, and sparkle like a diamond when the sun shines.It's rare to see an actual true blue self-made celebrity expose herself and her deep-rooted vulnerabilities to the unforgiving and sharp world.In Mumbai's make-believe and fake world, here comes a queen for her throne.She is a brilliant actress in the making, and her performance in her very first show was nothing short of a sensation.It's a worthy show.God Bless You, Little Child.Note: Her family and friend circle is fantastic, and she is lucky to have them around.",False

And the sort of hate she receives daammm why do such people even waste their time commenting and bothering.You go girl!Amazing series. Urfi and family in their elements.It does show the rawness and the things that actually go behind the camera and in the family.Just people not very use to of camera might feel that are delivery a dialogue, but it's OK.Why do India have to pull down their people .

I am just worried that after her success, she might become Sophisticated and lose her true self...! I would watch an entire show on just Urusaüòçüòç.All her lines are quotable - ""Hum emotionally unavailable parents ke emotionally unavailable kids hain.....""
I loved what Uorfi said at Social Nation. The universe is not going to do anything for you if you don't do something first. I didn't expect this show to give me life lessons as it did. Wish it had few more episodes, hoping for a another season of this realistic show. Recommended for all reality show lovers.",False

I love seeing someone truly achieve everything on their own marriage without any support especially financial support. I hope the sisters become millionaires, because I wanna see an underdog win and achieve all their dreams. I absolutely love the sister. It's an understatement. I am obsessed with this show and cannot wait for season two. I hope there is an ark for all the characters where they heal from their traumas, and rise above from toxic patterns. I love how they all have each other's back!!!!!!!!!",True

20,8,Loved watching urfi and uruusa,vk-87989,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really enjoyed watching the show and specially Uruusa how she being the eldest one carries the most of the trauma but still tries to be okay with the remarks on her by the family.. also i loved how urfi comes from a mediocre background and now doing so good and i wish that she'll get more because they really deserve it..
Overall I loved the show but there were some parts like the surgery one i think that's just useless and if urfi you are reading this review.. you don't need that surgery youuu are already so beautiful and be the way you are that's what you are known for and specially i liked you because of your confidence but after seeing that it feels like you are not confident of your body.. ik it's your choice you can do anything with your body but it's just my opinion you are perfect the way you are.. and at last i wish that we'll get a season 2 soon and i would love to see Uruusa more.",True
21,10,"Brilliant series, Urfi is larger than Any canvas you'll ever see",manavkum,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love this series, absolutely crafted with care and great edits, never a dull moment to watch...made this series almost to the level of ""Wild wild country"" and other in genre.Youll learn a lot about Urfi and her family members a lot, more than media ever said. She is not your so charming happy go lucky Ananya and jhanvi...she dares to dream big , dream it all, sharp to know her bottlenecks and issues, coming from B town but not shallow and stupid like Kangna ..less said the better, must watch this entire series.Never felt like it was prescripted show, natural conversations fitted in. Her Sisters , Urusa is wise , Asfi is more human like and vulnerable, wise but dolly is ambitious like her and MUST get out of Lucknow regardless anyone goes with her or not...And what's wrong with sameer...he should've never born. Their dad's final AND only WIN. Can't he do graduation on his own without mama's and sisters support?URFI, wish you best and hope you kick asses of hardest kinds.",False
22,10,Urfi is autistic and has a powerful vision that others don't understand,anikadamg,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm autistic myself and she says so many of the things I believe for the reasons I believe them.She consistently explains what she's trying to do and why, invites others to explain themselves and guide her but they keep listening to her tone and misunderstanding her.She hates change and hates being lied to and has the classic three sources of hydration in mugs going all day.She's driven as hell and literal and direct and an amazing autistic icon.It's so cathartic watching her be right over and over again seeing her struggle to communicate, have meltdowns over social situations and feel guilt over them.I hope one day she realises she's autistic and reads Love and Autism by Kay Kerr.",False
23,10,Badass!! You Go Girl!!,drvidhya,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am so impressed by this girl!! She is a total badass!! She is ready to carve her life out on her terms without giving two hoots about people trying to pull her down. She comes from nothing and has made it so far!!I have to say, I never watched her or followed her before. I just saw some crazy pics of hers and didn't think much of her. But I have a new respect for this woman now!! But I will follow her now. She is like the Kardashian of India. And despite the crazy sisterhood, they somehow make it work. She is uplifting the whole family. I am looking forward to the next season.You go, girl!! I am sure the women's brigade is rooting for you. You inspire us all üíï",False
24,10,Kim could never!,bmstinsontore,n/a,16/08/2025,"Urfi Javed is like that sparkly glitter that sticks with you - once she's in your life, you're hooked. Some may call her the Kim Kardashian from Meesho, but let's face it: Kim could never!I find Urfi and her family extremely relatable. Follow kar lo yaar is less about being aspirational and more about documenting what a small-town ambitious girl would do when she's hungry for success and willing to go after it, even if she doesn't have many options.Urfi's youngest sibling is the only guy in the family and he plays the role of the straight man, which is pretty funny. Asfi is the sensitive one, Dolly is like a mini Urfi, and Urusa is the dark horse.Makers did a great job with keeping things organic and authentic!Overall, it's a fun show to watch. I would definitely recommend it.",False

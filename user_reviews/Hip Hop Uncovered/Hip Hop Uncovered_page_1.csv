1,10,An essential Documentary for everyone to see,sammylovescarrots,n/a,16/08/2025,"Showing thw story of how hip hop began, what hip hop really is and stands for and showing what 'the streets' are really like and how black lives are still treated awfully and wrongly.Open your eyes and watch this documentary. Very engaging and interesting. Important for everyone to see, and if you're a hip hop fan you'll especially love it.",False
2,4,"Interesting at first, boring at last",dvdzaan,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI'm not from the US so pardon me if I'm not in the loop. But this in this documentary a lot of unknown crips affiliated people (also some very famous people) talk about their contribution to hiphop. They talk very criminal and bad things right which they've done in the past while smoking a Cuban cigar in their mansion. Half of the last episode is about the death of a rapper I've never heard of. That's when I checked out. Peace.,True
3,1,"Documentary has potential, Haitian Jack ruined it.",gtstaples,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just hearing Haitian Jack talk, his facial expressions, and his eye movements makes it obvious that he's full of himself and Is a liar too. Also, a documentary about hip hop should be unbiased, and to let Haitian Jack try and put down Tupac and tarnish his name is unacceptable. He seems like a rat. Why is he even on this documentary? He isn't on the level of Big U, Deb, Trick Trick, or Bimmy. I wouldn't even call this a documentary about Hip Hop. I know the streets have a huge impact on Hip Hop from its roots to what it has evolved into today, but I just wasn't feeling it. Started to put me to sleep after episode 3.",False

1,7,Charming recount of a neighbour's friendship with Doug Bennett's family,msghall,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is much to like about this documentary featuring the director and her next-door neighbours, the Bennetts, more specifically its talented son, Doug. Charm oozes from everyone who is interviewed, even the director's mom, who is none to keen on the sometimes confounding Doug, whose intelligence and drive make for great storytelling from the rest of the interviewees.After a career cartooning for the then underground Georgia Straight, Doug went on to form one of Canada's finest groups, Doug and Slugs. This doc explores the rise of the group through the eyes of the director, her family and band members.I liked it a lot but I couldn't help but hope that a proper documentary about the multifaceted Doug Bennett and his motley crew of wonderful musicians will also follow. It's long overdue.",False

1,6,May The 4th Be With You!!!,brad_kellerda,n/a,16/08/2025,"You can never go wrong by watching a making of documentary of your favorite franchise. You get to see why they made the choices they made as well as the movie magic behind it all. With some less than stellar moments throughout, The Book of Boba Fett, I really enjoyed getting the creatives insight into why they made those decisions.",False
2,6,Documentary about the making of The Book of Boba Fett series,Zeyders,n/a,16/08/2025,"It feels like they made a documentary just to exist, and to some extent for themselves and fans who want to see the story behind the creation of the Boba Fett series.If you watched the documentary series about the creation of The Mandalorian, you won't learn much here, except for one moment and other similar stories like The Mandalorian and its creation. Made in the form of a one-episode story about the creation of the entire 1 season in 1 hour is enough, as there is nothing more to talk about and to put a check mark.You can watch it if you really want to, but it is unlikely that you will learn something new for yourself.",False
3,5,Fell short of expectations...just like the show,grlym1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just like the mandalorian VS book of Fett shows, the Disney galleries differed in quality as wellSo much of the book of Fett galley was from the mandalorian show. Or, talking about the episodes in BoF, but we're really mandalorian episodes. Just really showed how this show is a side show. It wasn't fully in water in and monitored for vector and feel like the mandalorian was. Opportunities missed...Don't get me wrong, there was a lot of good stuff in the show, but little to help us understand why the book of Fett took such a hard left (in cringy ways). The gallery show was the perfect opportunity to help us understand decisions like just dumping the sand people plot mid stream or the incongruent Mos Vespa gang. This was the moment to help us get on board with speaking to why...whyInstead they dodged it completely. Which to me...says they had nothing positive to say about it. I think they probably knew it was contentious but someone got overruled. And so it became canon. I think they were too embarrassed to bring it up.Then again, the galleries are about showing off innovations and their critical best moments. And the lack of addressing everything fans bashed the show about gives me hope. Because this verifies that Disney and Lucas film was embarrassed and clearly knew it was not their highlight of the show. Not even notable. So I am hopeful that this means a course correction will occur if they do a season 2.",False

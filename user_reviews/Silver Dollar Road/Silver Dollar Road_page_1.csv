1,8,"Informative, entertaining and inspiring.",amjames-95772,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched Silver Dollar Road at a film viewing at ECSU's campus. I would have given it a 10 rating, but I did leave the viewing wanting more of the story. That isn't possible because its my understanding its still ongoing. But, I do think the production was quite stellar.The audience was attentive and on the edge of our seats throughout the entire film.I wish everyone could see this film. It really humanizes and magnifies the issue of heir land ownership in a way that you only hear about on a small scale level.I hope that filmmakers will do a follow-up, or even a series to share continued updates with those interested.",False
2,10,Living in Carteret County,hoopswife,n/a,15/08/2025,"I moved to Cartertet County about 8 years ago. I can attest this county is run by rich white men and families who can trace their bloodlines back about 200 rears or more. There is a lot of corruption and greed in this county. There is a lot of racism here. I read comments in our newspaper calling the Reels story a lie. I believe the Reels' story 100%. I believe the family was cheated. It's a disgrace the Reels' spent any.time incarcerated. It hurts my heart they were shackled like animals. There are real criminals in this county who get away with everything. Carteret County should be absolutely
mortified this happened and it's still not resolved. The attorneys who took this families money without helping them are a total disgrace. This county owes the brothers restitution. They need to give the family their land back now.",False
3,10,Completely Unjust!!,tamlarue,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this today and was so angry with our society, the lawyers who took advantage of this family, and our court system. When will society stop seeing color and instead see only character?I hope the filmmakers do a followup and reveal who tried to steal this property! It left me wanting to know the rest of the story. What happened to Melvin and Curtis? Who was appointed the conservator over the land? If I was an attorney, I would help this family for free. I pray that God intervene and stop this atrocity.Great job Amazon and especially to Raoul Peck who wrote and directed this documentary.",False
4,3,Made it one sided.,sailorsgrave-22274,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNo will from the get go then it goes to the heirs.One of the family members ""Shedrick"" states claim with a false deed and sells a portion. Should've never been filed since it's under ""Heirs"" all names should've been signed off on it.Bottom line always make sure there's a will.Those guys should've never spent 8 years for trespassing. Someone should answer for that.Those rich development companies would've done it to anyone. Corporate Greed is ruthless. It turned to race and the old lady holding the camcorder calling out y t. Their own family screwed them from the get go, but yeah it's only someone else's fault.It still shows in GIS the 13 acres that their own family member screwed them over on the waterfront property is no longer under Adam's Creek development, it's under Meriman LLC.So Shedrick is a con and the Carteret County justice system is shady.End of story.Ehhh....",True
5,10,Native to Carteret County here.,MosesJones,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was born in Carteret County and live here now with my family. This county is rotten with corruption, past and present. What was done to these men is appalling and incomprehensible and the county should pay for it tenfold. Look at our past Sheriff's department corruption. This story needs national attention so that the Carteret County judicial system will be brought to it's knees and held accountable for the egregious acts committed upon Melvin and Licurtis. Let's investigate Adam's Creek Associates and the judge who granted Sheldon rights to the heirs property. I will guarantee you there were Carteret County commissioners on the planning board for the planned subdivision on Silver Dollar Road, and I would greatly assume that the last name Wheatley was involved in this escapade. Investigate and bring these men to justice, Carteret County needs a deep cleansing of it's corruption and quickly at that. Too many judges, lawyers, and a particular nameless Sheriff here who think they hold the cards to play out however they intend. Bring the State Bureau down to Carteret County and trust me they would have a field day with all they will find. Let's get started and turn this county around for the better, time to get rid of all the bad actors here.",False
6,10,Truly heartbreaking!,nikkyng-76377,n/a,15/08/2025,"I haven't cried so much watching a documentary ever. This is so unfair and unjust. This is the truth for so many African American families and it just breaks my heart seeing people go through this. I pray that the family and other families alike get the justice that they deserve! Not only is this a compelling story, but it speaks volumes as to what so many people in this country has had to endure. Eights years in jail for trespassing? That's insane! I really hope that this family is able to file a civil suit against the city. They need to call a top civil attorney immediately for probono asap!",False
7,10,The Sad song of the South plays on.,dpminelli,n/a,15/08/2025,"Moving and beautiful and raw and real. I hope this movie is recognized for its story and though it is threaded with messages of ""white folk"", many of the local white folk were in tears last night when it aired. The family members aren't being ""racist"" either. I was born and raised there and this story was evidently kept fairly quiet. I pray this is the beginning of the story, not the end. Today, you can call me a ""Mad White Woman"" because I didn't know the story. It's telling that no names were ever mentioned of any of the ""players"" who engineered this land grab. When that part of this story is revealed, then the whole truth will be known. When that is done, I believe real justice for this family might finally be achieved.",False
8,10,Truly heartbreaking.,ambert-27502,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a truly heartbreaking story. I am glad that this family's fight is being documented. The film is a riveting documentary on a family trying to keep the land that their ancestors purchased right after the civil war. I pray that this family gets their land back and that it never leaves their family. To anyone denying racism, they need to watch this movie. It is a testimony that shows racism and the law in some instances are part and parcel. Nobody in that family should have gone to jail for refusing to leave their own property. They should not be fighting to retain their land after 30 plus years. They supplied all of the documentation that showed it belongs to them.",False
9,10,"Good, sad, but good",HumbleMensa,n/a,15/08/2025,"Oh my gosh this is a heartbreaking story, the documentary tells it well and I wanted more and more and more of this one. If you have ever lived in certain regions for any length of time you are well aware of situations like the one that unfolds throughout Silver Dollar Road. Although it's not exclusive to certain regions because ...well...follow the money...but the overriding theme is awful to watch and know what's happening. Please watch with open eyes but don't keep them closed. I feel so very sorry for what this family had to deal with and the producers, directors and real people involved in this make points and reveal realities that should horrify anyone. I'm glad I watched this.",False
10,10,Heartbreaking,zmqxxphhkx,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just watched this documentary. It's profound, speaks to every black family in America, and to myself as a black woman from the south. Racism is not dead it only evolved with the times... sadly. It's just not right to go through stuff like this. I pray for healing/strength for LiCurtis and Melvin, and healing/strength for their whole family. I really wish this country wasn't the way it was/is/and will be(future tense) this place is just a corporation sadly and seeks to destroy and divide families and destroy history whether that history was good or bad it's still ours and our ancestors.I pray that this family wins their fight, and gain EVERY BIT OF LAND that was STOLEN FROM THEM. I pray this prayer for the current generation's and for their future generations... in Jesus name Amen!",False

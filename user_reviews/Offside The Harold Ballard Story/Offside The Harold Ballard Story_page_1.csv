1,6,So So Documentary,jonnyv,n/a,16/08/2025,"At the outset I'll say that I have high regard for Jason Priestley, the creator of the brilliant Canadian series Call Me Fitz. This documentary, however, was just middling.I have read several books on Harold Ballard and this biopic was much of the same. We know he was cantankerous, racist and misogynistic and indeed there are more examples of that here. There are also examples of him being cheap and treating his employees poorly and consequently making it next to impossible for the Leafs to succeed. All of that has been said or done before.This documentary was billed as bringing something new to the table. It didn't, although many of the clips were interesting and brought back memories. Unfortunately Priestley did not have access to anyone from Ballard's inner circle and it showed.For those unfamiliar with Harold Ballard or too young to have lived through his constant shenanigans, this show may be of more interest. For those who already know the story, not so much.",False
2,8,Very well done reveal,briangm,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Toronto Maple Leafs haven't won the Stanley Cup since 1967 and this well done documentary explains pretty clearly why the team failed from 1968 thru 1992, or almost half of the 56 years (and counting) spent in the wilderness. We have been following this team since just before it began winning 4 Cups in the 1960's, and not surprisingly it's been pretty depressing. Ballard's goal throughout has been to enhance his personal wealth and he was so fortunate that hockey fans in Toronto kept buying those hard-to-get tickets throughout. As long as revenue remained high, Ballard saw no reason to ""waste"" it on quality players or coaches or scouts for future players. The fans became enablers of his greedy lifestyle. Priestly has done a fine job of interviewing all the relevant characters from the late 60's thru 1993. Current Leaf fans will find this educational, especially those under age 35.",False
3,7,The Worst Owner In The History Of Professional Sports,sddavis63,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs since I was a little boy - which means that I remember the up and down but sometimes hopeful Ballard years of the 1970's and the absolutely disastrous 1980's when the team was little more than a bad joke presided over by a man who, in my opinion, has to be considered to be literally the worst owner in the history of professional sports: Harold E. Ballard. With those memories I watched this documentary about the Ballard years in Maple Leaf history. It begins by noting the Leaf dynasty of the 1960's (4 Stanley Cups), runs through how Ballard ended up in control and then traces the decline and fa!! Of the team and deals a lot with the clown show the team became. It's full of historic footage of Ballard, and features lots of interviews with players and executives and reporters who dealt with him. All that is very interesting and certainly brings back memories (many of them bad ones!)Having said that, there's nothing ground-breaking here. There's no big revelation that anyone interested in Ballard or the history of the Leafs wouldn't already know. It just goes over well known ground. It's a very polished production, and its biggest contribution is bringing together the entire Ballard era in a single documentary. Fans of the Leafs will enjoy it. Others might if they're interested in the story of a cranky old man who loved being in the spotlight. (7/10)",False
4,10,An excellent documentary on a less than excellent human,chuckat-38589,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was anticipating an excellent doc from a great Canadian, Jason Priestley. Jason and Michael Geddes used archives and interviews in my opinion to almost perfection. And the controversial inclusion of Alan Eagleson gave impartiality that a person like Ballard needed.I like how they went to the Leaf greats from the past and didn't use middling players. I think it was very wise not to mention the abuse from the 70's and 80's that happened but wasn't mentioned.I came away from this with the same opinion I went in with. A very flawed, morally bankrupt, yet charitable and very polarizing figure. You won't be disappointed. CG.",True
5,9,Leafs are gonna win the cup.,AB4471,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie cuts deep at times... really striking the emotional chords of us cynical Leafs Fans still afraid of commitment due to the brutal defeat at the hands of Boston in the year 2013 of our lord Stanley.Contains a lot of footage featuring the ""older faces"" of the franchise, some great sportscasters too, telling stories around Harold, but also around the team. Well edited for what is a big story, about a big guy, and a big club.Nostalgia for anyone growing up a Leaf Fan and remembering the Leafs playing Saturday Night at the Gardens. Better than expected, even with the pre-watch emotional baggage.",False
6,1,Offside indeed,christopherwilliam,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story of Harold Ballard is an important one however including one of hockeys biggest crooks in on the story is shameful. Alan Eagleson is a disgraced Canadian for stealing player pension funds and for corruption of the game. He was likely the first to be cancelled and this is where he ought to stay. Wasn't his Order of Canada revoked when he was sent up prison for embezzled?CBC and producer, Jason Priestley dropped the ball by including AE and it was important to highlight this.Aside from this, lots of greats make appearances and would be worth a watch. If only I could keep watching after AE's corrupt mug arrived on my screen.CBC, please do better. Ok thanks.",False

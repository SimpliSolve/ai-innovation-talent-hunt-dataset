1,7,mother and daughter connect,ferguson-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Fourteen years spent teaching advanced degree architectural students at Columbia led to her being denied tenure, so Ada Karmi-Melamede did what any self-respecting and incredibly talented architect would do ... she quit the job and bet on herself. It's a bet that has resulted in numerous high-profile projects in her homeland, Israel.Ada's story would likely remain an untold secret if not for her daughter, Yael Melamede. Yael directs the film, but more importantly, masterfully directs her mother Ada into opening up about her life and career. It's not an easy path for either woman, as Ada left her family to pursue her own career and passion for architecture, a step much more common for fathers than mothers.To quell any doubts as to whether this is just a family member attempting to create publicity, or whether Ada's work is deserving of such a tribute, one need only view some of her most famous projects: the Supreme Court of Israel, the Ben Gurion Airport, and the Open University of Israel. And beyond that are her contributions to New York: a master plan for Con Edison and a housing competition on Roosevelt Island. Should you need more, we see accolades from famed architects Frank Gehry, Keith Frampton, and Mose Sofdie. Despite her lack of widespread acclaim, Ada Karmi-Melamede is truly one of the most accomplished architects in the world.Adding intrigue, this documentary is not just about a talented architect. There is also the personal element which finds a grown woman striving to find connection with her mother ... a mother who admittedly didn't possess typical motherly attributes. One is a woman who longs to know more, while the other is a woman who tends to balk at saying much about herself, her life, or her reasons. Seeing the defensiveness fade away is quite something, and a tribute to daughter Yael for encouraging the connection. We learn much about her childhood, the family, the influences, and the life each had without the other.Ada is most comfortable talking about her profession. Her pencil versus computer segment strikes a chord, and when she reacts to a tour guide's description of her work, the moment is priceless. We begin to understand her passion when she discusses the Parthenon, and the shots of her own projects leave no doubt as to her influence. Ada's feelings on current Israeli politics are crystal clear, and the segment on ""Time"" provides a life lesson for everyone.Opens in NYC on May 9, 2025, and in LA on May 15, 2025.",False

1,9,Wonderful film!,cappels,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gracefully shot, Fandango at the Wall takes the viewer through a musical journey and offers a beautiful and inspiring view of the world.",False
2,10,Moving look at the power of music!,daughterofwaters,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film touched the hallmark of everything that the world needs at this moment. The perspectives of humanity, art, barrier shattering, and cultural niches made for such a soul soothing film. The interconnectivity of a musician from New York with a librarian who spends time on both sides of the US/Mexico border who finds folkloric musicians in Veracruz, Mexico was told so beautifully and without agenda. Fandango at the Wall stands as a salient reminder that the US is an amalgamation of other nations, peoples, and lands. Bravo!!!! Feliz!!!",False
3,10,An amazing film for our time,mp-92442,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love this documentary - it is moving, powerful, engaging, and inspiring.

4,10,A Film with Deep Impact,carlos-90828,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA truly remarkable film about the impact of the music of Fandango, this picture has become an important reference historical point. A striking feature of the film is its coloring, prevalent throughout the movie, of the clothing and ambience of the film. It's based on the music of son jarocho, a musical style that comes from Veracruz, north eastern Mexico, which combines both unique dance and musical forms. A truly extraordinary film that will have a great influence on the understanding of societies.",True
5,10,"Borders cannot contain culture, life, and love",vinnyvangogh,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am no film critic, and I don't normally take the time to review, but this one I had to review positively on. The story it conveys is one that is timeless and everchanging, the power that culture has, especially when you bring many different ones together. Music is a celebration and a weapon against the darkness of our world. This film was beautifully shot, crafted, and produced. It shares many messages of hope, peace, love, and open-mindedness. But it's true power comes from it's authenticity. Thank you for bringing this to the world.

14,10,LOVE THIS FILM,markjcancelliere,n/a,15/08/2025,"The central journey, to the origins of this native music, and the feeling of unity and togetherness created while the artists are playing together is one of the most beautiful, honest, human expressions I've seen in a film; the art simply ""moves through the walls"" and speaks to every living thing's universal quest for the soul, AND equally to the hardships many people in the world face, and because of that what it means to be, and APPRECIATE being an American who embraces diversity and welcomes the traditions of others - the music is the real richness.

15,10,Subtle and moving window into the politics of the border through music,stefan-86682,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film peeks into the human experience, or lack of humanity) of the issues surrounding the border wall. Without overtly delving into the politics, this film humanizes through music and even more so the musicians featured in the film. It is impossible to come away from this film with a better understanding of how arbitrary border policies can be, especially in this era. That said, the music is phenomenal... you will also want to attend a Fandango after this!",False

19,8,Music is the Fandango at the Wall Story!,dthompson-35071,n/a,15/08/2025,Fandango at the Wall is one of the best documentaries and so relevant for today. The beauty of the film unites people in song and dance on both sides of the Tijuana-San Diego border. Fandango at the Wall is an amazing film with music that enhances the story line. The true spirit of the film presents a vision of today's state of affairs. It's wonderful to see what could become a classic. The filmmakers have viewed the Fandango festival as a rich source of storytelling. Fandango at the Wall provides the opportunity for audiences to be exposed to stories different from their own with music that supports it.,False

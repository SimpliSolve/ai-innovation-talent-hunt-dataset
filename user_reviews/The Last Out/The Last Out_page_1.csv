1,10,Way more than a baseball movie,kbporter-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"I came in expecting a story about how hard it is to make it into the major leagues and what motivates the players to try their hardest against unbelievable odds. However, midway through, the film takes a turn that ups the stakes even more and personalizes some larger societal issues. It definitely gets to a point where you wonder how the filmmakers were able to film what they did!",False
2,10,Unbelievable sad,ablbodyed-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI expected an ultimately uplifting story about the sport that I love. This is not that. It is a revelation of the pain and the terrible trials of these three young men, who left Cuba full of hope that their talent would serve them well. But the obstacles that they faced were over-whelming and none of them achieved their goal. One of them had to run the gauntlet of getting from Costa Rica to the US, with constant mental and financial strains. He was taken advantage of repeatedly. But so were the other two, one of whom disappeared by the end. The biggest advantage-taker was their supposed ticket to the ""Bigs"", a real slime-ball. Why he ever agreed to be filmed is mind-boggling, because he as revealed as a predator of these dependent, lonely and frightened young men. I started crying about half-way through, and did not stop crying even after the film ended. I recommend this, but only if you are willing to be saddened.",True

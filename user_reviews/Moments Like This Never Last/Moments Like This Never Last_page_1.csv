1,8,Time Capsule of the early 00's New York scene,stevencoombe-01706,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great insight into the life of Dash Snow & the culture of early 00's New York. So many familiar faces throughout from various industries, was a great watch for a mix of music, graffiti & art right before social media.",False
2,1,Boring Posers Fronting,fraser-simons,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was so, so, so bad. You can't even imagine how bad it is. The subjects come off idiotic, unable to even frame the premise in an interesting way. Their stories are facile, recounting their badass days of throwing wet toilet paper and watermelons onto sidewalks from above, suggesting this is peak anarchy.",False
3,2,What a Bore,arfdawg-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"For a guy who was supposed to have such a chaotic fast moving life, this movie in relentlessly boring.The guy, born in priviledge, clearly had a mental condition that was never addressed and ultimately offed himself via drugs.It's a bore and his so called art is amateurish. Why anyone wanted to document this clown is beyond me, except for the fact that he comes from a rich and priviledged family.His grandfather is Uma Thurman's father.",False
4,1,Portrait of An Artist as a Young Man and Cliché,The_revenge_of_Wallis_Simpson,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's easy to understand why the NY Art scene has become rather tired and uninspired. This boring documentary is nothing more than a collection of the artist as self destructive tortured bad boy clichés. The art shown here is nothing new that we haven't seen before - it all seems very derivative of 60s counterculture (think Warhol Superstars) including lashing of drugs and imagery that seems trite, posed and predictable. Naturally, the artist, who originated from the super wealthy De Menil family, made sure it was all very well documented in polaroids and grainy black & white footage before exiting at 27 (yet another cliché). Ironically, one art work depicts masturbation as art which encapsulate the artist perfectly. Be prepared for one tired old cliché after another and another.",False

1,1,Too funny,mroy99,n/a,16/08/2025,The media who is largely responsible for causing the deep divisions in our country wants to tell us how to heal the divisions. You can't make this stuff up. I wouldn't waste a second of your time on this trash heap.,False
2,n/a,Can't see the forest for the trees,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not gonna vote for this documentary because I am sitting on 49// fence and I am looking 'inside' and what I see is SAD and a scary déjà vu.So, let's start:
When a president proclaimed: 'You are either with us or against us'.And started wars on 'false pretenses'.And no one (in media) question that statement...And if someone dare to do so is crucified by (social)media and DoJ (i.e. Dixie Chicks, journalists jailed for not revealing their source and a myriad of whistleblowers).When free speech become the acceptable speech, ONLY; and you get 'cancel', called names, stamped, if you drift from it.When the press and news media transform itself from the Fourth Estate or fourth power into nothing more that stenographs (mouth piece) and echo chambers of this or that special interest, of this or that political agenda.When dialogue (two or more sides work together toward common understanding) vanished.When debate (two sides oppose each other and attempt to prove each other wrong) turned dismissive and violent.And all this divide, goes unhealed for decades (i.e. Nixon).Well, it locks (in my view) that democracy (American style) is on the verge of collapse, maybe it needs some profound reforms (not some cosmetic touch-ups).Good Luck.",False
3,10,Hope For These Dark Times,gbo-48510,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is a breath of fresh air from the constant deluge of hate, fear, and division that we constantly receive through our various media sources. This film is an invitation to anyone to lay down their efforts to destroy and dehumanize the ""other side"" and open your heart to what is possible when we truly see each other and the infinite value we each hold. Thanks to the team who saw that we needed this film.",False
4,7,Pleasantly surprised,qnpnmzdr,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerYes there is a problem with racism in America. America is not all racism. There is a divide in the country and it is up to us to try and bridge the gap. It shouldn't matter who votes how. It's about individualism.,True
5,1,"America is not a racist country, people are.",colonel-13070,n/a,16/08/2025,"America is not a racist country, people are.This documentary is awful, and the irony of it all is the people who caused it, the media are the people responsible and involved in this production.They are right when they say the system is rigged, but not for the reasons they want you to believe. It is rigged in that we can never win. They need hate and divisive Ness to justify the existence of the left-wing parties. They need to constantly move the goalpost so we can never win and be together. That would be the end of their party as we know it. They need to keep people down, to develop new victims from birth and make sure that they don't rise up to think for themselves and become successful that's not needing the left anymore. Do you think it's a coincidence that everything the left touches is filled with poverty and despair. They do nothing of any real substance to get these people up and out. They do everything to allow them to maintain their current status which is already at zero. They need these people to remain in their poverty stricken element. They need to foster hateful race relations so that there is Victimhood mentality. And lastly let's not forget the money, always follow the money. An activist wants told me the cops in his area do too good of a job cleaning up their streets and that will put him and others out of a job because they will not be a need any longer. So we go around in circles forever. Then they produce something like this to make you believe that they really want it and do all of this race schism. They don't. Again it would put them out of a job. Then they might have to actually report the truth instead of making it up as they go along to fit political agendas. So we go around in circles again, forever.",False
6,10,Couldn't be more relevant,undinebuka,n/a,16/08/2025,A very important film for this time. Emotional and heartfelt.,False
7,10,Enlightening & Inspirational!,jaydeee-33722,n/a,16/08/2025,The only way we will reunite as Americans is to acknowledge that racism definitely exists. An inspiring documentary that encourages real dialogue about race and privilege in America.,False

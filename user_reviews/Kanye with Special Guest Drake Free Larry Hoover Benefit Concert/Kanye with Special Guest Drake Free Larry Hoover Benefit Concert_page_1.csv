1,10,Undeniably Kanye Is A Musical Genius!!!,zac-68274,n/a,15/08/2025,Kanye's choir opens up and perform the first 20 min. But not a disappointing moment because Kanye performs just about every song in his amazing Anthology!,False
2,10,Perfect Concert,liamdempsey-53448,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerStarts with a beautiful angelic choir that goes into Kanye his hit songs which some he hasn't played at a concert since 2016, after Kanye Drake plays some of his own songs from his album which was definitely the worst part but Kanye makes it worth it.",True
3,10,HOLY W,liamdempsey-53448,n/a,15/08/2025,GREATEST CONCERT OF ALL TIME I WISH I WAS THERE.Your Review is too short. It needs to contain 150 characters. What even is 150 characters.....................................................,False
4,1,Requires patience,ryanmrobertson09,n/a,15/08/2025,25 minutes until Kanye raps. That's 25 minutes of bloated ego to sit through until you hear him spit a verse. Dude could have come out the gate with fire but loves to leave the audience in mild suspense.,False
5,4,Why is Drake's name in this?,mystee_reyne,n/a,15/08/2025,"The title is very misleading. You would think from the title this was a Watch the Throne type deal or a Best of Both Worlds type concert. Nope. Drake escorts Kanye to the stage. And is like his silent hype man for 1 or 2 songs. What in the name of all things decent kind of sorcery is this? How do you put someone's name in the headliner of a concert, but then they don't perform? Anyway, I fast forwarded. It was boring. One man, one mic. One thing to be complemented was the stage set up and show ambiance. Kanye looked as if he was walking atop of a flat Earth in the midst of a beautiful and sparkling Universe. Outside of that, I was disappointed.",False
6,1,The bitter truth about a guy who wishes to be Freddy mercury,langmann-27527,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSkip to min 25, thank me later.Beside that really poor and boring Performance of ye and drake, the whole ""i wann Show everyone iam a artistic genious"" attitude Shows how much kanye wishes to be creative again like in the 2000s After flipping burgers and turns out to be more authistic then authentic. Orange ski gloves, oversized snowboard shoes and a kanye out of breath changing to Playback After 30 mins, or autotunes...Special guest drake lol, he came up on stage in 2 hours 3 Times...once walking Down the stairs like snow white leaving the prince..twice he was mimicin kanye for 3 mins without microphone and the third time he actually performed for 1:30 over his own playback.Next to All of this clowncircus, the whole Organisation of cameramens and cameracranes and drones were so poorly coordinated, there was one dude always nearly in every shot.But yeah, basicly a 40 yo dude, walking strangely on a huge Smoking mochi, while blabberin in the mic..U know, maybe flippin burgers wasnt that Bad at all...",True
7,1,Kanye is a snake,qqnkxgx,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis guy is a piece of work. Don't get me wrong, I love all the Kanye songs, I think he's incredibly creative and his talent as a producer and designer is undeniable....however, this was the worst concert ever. Terrible. It was actually boring as hell, running around an empty stage solo, through dry ice in mom jeans and space boots hyping himself up. I felt bad for the people in the audience. Not really sure exactly what he actually did to support / educate towards freeing Larry Hoover. Then to top it off, he needs to beg Drake to come help support his cause to pump up his viewership - not for Hoover - for himself. Not only does drake actually agree to come, Kanye shows up late and then hits him with a sneak attack verzuz. Then after drake has a way more interesting performance - adding melody variations to his tracks, and even performing a better version of 24, they cut his 30 minute performance from the special? Why? No explanation. But we all know why.Kanye is a petty man. Hip hop fans were hoping this pathetic beef was over because together they can be great. But Kanye still has resentment about losing all kinds of things to drake - being a good father, bigger house, bigger pool, more money, more women etc..Don't waste your time on this. But if youre going to waste your time anyways I promise you'll ask yourself - what did drake even do?Instead of watching on Amazon prime, go to YouTube to see the entire performance. But that's only if you literally have nothing else better to do.",True
8,3,Big Miss. Thankfully it was a free benefit show...,xespox,n/a,15/08/2025,"...because people would have been pissed if they spent money on this. Also, why are we trying to free a convicted murderer from 1973 serving multiple life sentences? Kanye (Ye) is not a good performer. His ego is too big to understand anything. Drake? Why are you even here? This entire performance was confusing. Kanye, didn't even get in his zone. Smh! Drake showed up for what, 4 songs? The best part of this entire show is when you can blatantly hear the audience singing in unison during specifics parts of songs. That's about it.",False

1,7,Waaaaaay too long,IceQueen99,n/a,16/08/2025,"In our attention-deficit.society, this was way too long and this story could have been told in half the time.",False
2,10,More resolution than I expected,jenjoylife,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI followed this case a few years ago and when Paul Fronzack hadn't been found. I was happy to see that he connected with his mother. There are several storylines that I wished we had answers to (what happened to Paul as he appeared to be raised by loving parents), what happened to Jill, and why won't his true siblings believe when DNA doesn't lie. I feel like we should know where we come from. But likely we will never know this side of heaven.",True
3,9,Great story,bkcjohns-23-820187,n/a,16/08/2025,I agree.... Way too long but a great story. Heard about this after it aired. No new air dates so I downloaded the CNN app. I hit pause and it restarted and no fast forward so it took even longer to finish. Fascinating story though.,False
4,10,Some Closure,saysjenn,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI followed Paul's story when Barbara Waltera covered this a long time ago and was fascinated. So when this documentary popped up I dove right in looking for answers! I was afraid there would be nothing new learned but that was not the case. I had no idea Paul had the legendary CeCe Moore working on his case and knew if anyone could solve this, it would be her.There was some closure but what I don't understand is why the FBI kidnapping case remains unsolved. They found out who the kidnapped child was and they were raised by a single woman. It was a woman who came into the hospital dressed like a nurse and took him out of his mothers arms. The grandkids mentioned their grandmother in present tense so she is alive!! Why didn't the FBI knock down her front door to interrogate her? If it was her then where is the justice?I hope Paul's real siblings connect with him eventually and he finds his twin. It's just so sad. Great documentary! Unfortunately we do not have all the answers yet but maybe more will come with time!",True
5,9,Unimaginably Complex Real Life Story,DragonGrrl99,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am glad that the mystery of the two Pauls were resolved by the end of the story. I was a bit disappointed that the biological sister and brother didn't want to meet Paul. Perhaps they wanted to keep something in the family hidden, such as a murder or manic parent. Or they didn't want someone who is mostly a stranger to come in and demand a share of the inheritance. We may never know.I found it creepy that the maltreated twins were called Jack and Jill. All I can think of is the ""Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water/ Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after"" nursery rhyme. Quite possibly, we have here the making of a horror story. And Jill might have been gone many years ago.I also wished the kidnapped Paul and his family had shown their faces.The story has a lot of holes still. Perhaps internet sluthes have to work a bit harder to uncover the rest of the tale.",True
6,10,Excellet doc!,rinastein,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI was mesmerized by this documentary! I did not think it was too long at all. I felt that Paul had every right to find his people. It was amazing that he found his baby sitter to shed some light onto why his mother abandoned him. It is truly amazing that he became part of a family that loved him so much. I hope Paul can find Jill...or at least what happened to her. It's kind of sad that Paul's people are getting old and passing on. I was hoping that the kidnapped Paul would eventually be able to meet his mom. It was a terrible thing to have your baby taken from you! You have to be a really strong person to live through that. I think considering everything Paul was a very lucky child to be so loved.,True

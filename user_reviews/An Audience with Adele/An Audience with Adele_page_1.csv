2,8,An Audience with Adele,jboothmillard,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt had been about ten years since there was an Audience With special, the last one I remember watching was with Michael Bubl√©, and it was almost inevitable that one of the best singing superstars of the world from Great Britain would get a show. Adele has one of the greatest and most recognised voices of all time, and has had fantastic success over the years, including multiple wins at the Grammys, BRITs and the Academy Awards. It had been some time since she performed to a live audience, and in recent years she had lost a significant amount of weight and slimmed down, so she looks fabulous. This one-off special sees her perform to an audience of celebrities (and a little regular public) at The Palladium performing some of her greatest hits, and new songs from her upcoming album ""30"". Songs in the show include: ""Hometown"", ""Hello"", ""Send My Love (To Your New Lover)"", ""Easy On Me"", ""I Drink Wine"", ""Rolling in the Deep"", ""Hold On"", ""Set Fire to the Rain"", ""Someone Like You"", and ""Love Is a Game"". There is also a brief performance of ""Make You Feel My Love"" by Alan Carr when she walks off stage after getting emotional. Highlights in the show include her answering questions from the audience, including about her song writing (often inspired by her various breakups), a surprise as she is reunited with a schoolteacher, and obviously her natural north London speaking voice being occasionally filthy and cheeky, and her likeable dirty laugh. Celebrities that talk and are seen in the audience include: Clara Amfo, Boy George, Naomi Campbell, Alan Carr, Jodie Comer, Bryan Cranston, Alesha Dixon, Idris Elba, Dawn French, Josh Gad, Kate Garraway, Richard E. Grant, Nick Grimshaw, Harry Hill, Dame Kelly Holmes, Samuel L. Jackson, Suranne Jones, Daniel Kaluuya, Sir Ben Kingsley, Dua Lipa, Michael McIntyre, Mel B, Stephen Merchant, Graham Norton, Catherine O'Hara, Dermot O'Leary, Jonathan Ross and his daughter Betty Ross, Phillip Schofield, Gareth Southgate, Stormzy, David Tennant, Emma Thompson, Emma Watson, Greg Wise, Lord Sir Andrew Lloyd-Webber, and Years & Years (Olly Alexander). An Audience With was number 26 on ITV's 50 Greatest Shows. Very good!",True

4,4,An Audience with Adele,studioAT,n/a,15/08/2025,"Overhyped massively by ITV, this ended up being a decent if unspectacular event, with a whole host of celebs trying to desperately make themselves look like either friends of Adele or cool.It's good, don't get me wrong, but not the 'event TV' that ITV made it out to be.",False

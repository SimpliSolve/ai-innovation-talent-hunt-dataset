1,10,Beautiful portrait,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCornelis Vreeswijk is definitely one of the biggest icon in Swedish music and entertainment industry, being one of the biggest folk music icons during the 1960s.This documentary, like the feature film before it, delves into his life, career and hardships in an authentic, very interesting and expertly paced way.It doesn't try to side with or against the artist, but rather shows it all from several angles, providing both Cornelis' own words and his contemporaries, ex wives and friends. It is a complicated, yet beautiful portrait of a complicated man.Overall, very expertly cut and edited, and ever interesting and beautifully put together. Highly recommended for any fans of Cornelis!",True

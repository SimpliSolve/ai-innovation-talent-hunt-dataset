1,7,"An excellent documentary, yet it still has its limitations and cons!",moviegame456,n/a,16/08/2025,"First, I want to express sincere respect for George Knapp and his team, who produced this documentary with serious journalistic dedication and a strong sense of mission. While I enjoy sci-fi movies, I am not lost in fantasies; I am a science enthusiast, not a skeptic.I tend to be cautious when considering witness accounts that lack supporting evidence, such as photos, videos, or other concrete documentation. While some may indeed be sharing their genuine experiences, it's easy for truth and perception to intertwine, especially given that individual perspectives can be influenced by various factors, including mental and emotional states.I've watched numerous documentaries on UFOs, UAPs, aliens, and NHIs. Most are either sensationalized for mystery or purely for entertainment. However, this documentary felt genuinely serious, produced with the integrity of a journalist's honor, which left a strong impression. Initially, I assumed it would be like other documentaries, relying on unproven testimonies. But I was wrong; the inclusion of multiple witnesses and actual photos and videos of the incidents added credibility.One particularly striking scene was the jellyfish-like UAP phenomenon seen near a secret government base in the Middle East-footage unlike anything I've seen before. It doesn't seem fabricated.Yet, this documentary has limitations. For example, why did they choose to film near an isolated island at night when they could have easily captured footage during the day? They knew it was an area with frequent UAP sightings. It's likely that they shot at night because glowing UAPs evoke more curiosity. But, strangely, that episode ends without any follow-up in the next episode. Also, the scene introducing the mysterious black helicopter abruptly cuts off with no mention in later episodes. Why? As a professional journalist, further investigation should have been conducted, and as a viewer, it left me wondering.I won't go into further detail as it could be a spoiler.The final episode revisits the well-known incident ,the Phoenix UAP event. Although there were new witnesses, it came across as a bit of a clich√©, lacking fresh information.Lastly, unlike misidentified UAP phenomena like balloons, drones, or satellites, there is a hypothesis that some truly luminous and erratic UAPs may represent new, unexplained natural phenomena. The documentary's final episode could have focused more on scientific analyses of these phenomena. If I were an alien from an advanced civilization, I wouldn't send a glowing drone for surveillance. Why would it glow? Light implies electromagnetic activity, and there are scientific theories suggesting that glowing UAPs may result from interactions with Earth's magnetic fields or particle physics anomalies.I've seen similar UAP phenomena in ""The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch."" However, there's a complete lack of interviews with quantum mechanics or particle physicists, which is surprising. Although Dr. Travia Taylor appears, he is more of a science communicator and not a quantum physicist. If they are truly interested in UAPs, they should consult with particle physicists in the future, as I believe 99% of UAP phenomena are unexplained quantum or particle physics events. I don't discount the 1% possibility of interdimensional wormholes or actual alien drones.NASA's 2023 report on UAPs (""NASA UNIDENTIFIED ANOMALOUS PHENOMENA Independent Study Team Report"") is a rare, valuable analysis. For example, it analyzed the ""GoFast"" video captured by Navy aviators, concluding that this was not an alien UFO but a simple misidentification of an object drifting with the wind.Additionally, we should acknowledge that this type of documentary often features experts and individuals who are very supportive of UFO and alien theories, sometimes presenting scientifically unverified aspects with a bit of an excessive belief or conviction.Once again, I'm not skeptical about aliens or UFOs. I simply place more trust in objective, factual evidence and scientific analysis. I hope future documentaries move beyond mere entertainment and collaborate with more specialized scientists to emphasize rigorous scientific analysis and experimentation.As analysis and observation technology based on AI continue to advance, there's a growing need for a scientific approach beyond eyewitness accounts alone. This is essential if humanity is to uncover the truth.",False
2,5,"Overly scripted which undermines calling it ""investigative reporting""",Scotslad_007,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm interested in this topic when it is not overly sensationalized, and there are many previously shows that are way over the top. Over the top in terms on how it is narrated and also is just showing very weak evidence but taking leaps in logic. So it gets a 5 star for a massive improvement in how it was presented relative to others.I didn't like the parts of the show when meeting experts or eye witnesses at the side of roads, parking lots, etc. Getting out of the car and just start talking about it, it's like they were not taking this seriously. Possibly they didn't have a budget for a studio.The first episode of animal mutilation I found interesting as they show some real mysteries. I also like that folks refrained from attempting to fill in the blank but providing just the facts.On the other hand the underwater scan with non-human shapes really was a stretch and no investigative questions were asked. Often it felt that during the interviews that Knapp was looking for his own validation and not being objective in asking the hard questions.I didn't like the AARO counter report, the attempt to find solid information was a complete miss. We already have the information, I think the Phoenix Lights itself is more than enough. Witnessed by thousands, what is needed is acknowledgement that something happened that was far, far superior to our current understanding and capability.Overall the series was OK but due to lack of budget I assume, it needed better experts, better places to interview people (not outside your car) and less speculation and more facts.",False
3,6,Touch and go at times,jedpb,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI had high expectations of finding something new with this series, not disclosure, but some good expanding knowledge. However, I was left a little short in terms of satisfaction at the end.The filming style is more reminiscent of a reality show than a hard hitting investigation show - costing this series a fair amount of credibility in my eyes.I stuck with it to the end though and there's some good people introduced, one that particularly stood out was Tom King in episode 5, the guy's invested money into his project and put his money where his mouth is, I can't help but respect that.Episode 3 was just a complete joke start to finish - especially regarding the diving guy, his half of the episode is more akin to 'Ghost Hunters', to call it investigative work is nothing but an insult. If you have anything more than a very casual interest in the topic there's a high chance this episode will leave you enraged. In truth, within 15 minutes into this episode I nearly aborted the remainder of the series, truly awful.The source in episode 4 that allegedly filmed and leaked the 'jellyfish' video is the most unconvincing recounting I've seen in a very long time. Firstly, the video is highly considered to be nothing more than a smudge, splattered bug, or bird faeces on the lens. Secondly, the source claims that the original video was longer and included recorded evidence of ""the 'craft' coming to a complete stop and submerging in the water, later reemerging"" - quite the claim. Unfortunately, he then instantly proceeds to say how that part of the footage was immediately taken away and never seen again. In what world does that make any sense to anyone? If some agency or group were on hand to immediately and permanently confiscate the footage, why would they leave half - or even a single frame - of it behind?Aside from these two failings the rest is mostly enjoyable and plenty watchable.Finally, there are a couple of mistakes I clocked from Knapp himself, who probably shouldn't have made them. One where he mentions that David Fravor was flying an F-15 during his sighting, rather than the F-18 he was actually piloting. The second was the Phoenix Lights sighting (1997), Knapp said something along the lines of ""here we are 37 years later"". 37 years after 1997 is 2034.",True
4,7,Okay...,revkunze,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis series went from a solid investigation that was fascinating to watch until the last episode. It went from UFO investigations to UFOlogy. It's a religion for many who want the ""aliens"" or time travelers to be sending a message to save the planet and the human race. That's when I went skeptical. I still recommend it but with the same skepticism George Knapp has in his investigation. Is there a hidden agenda in this series? I'm strong in my Christian faith. I believe intelligent life exists outside this world. That doesn't change what I believe. If we discover there are aliens, that won't contradict what the Bible teaches. So, let the truth be known! Just don't make it about some religious experience. Stick with the science. There are some amazing things out there (says my source).",True
5,3,Feels as scripted as Pawn Stars,pappamea,n/a,16/08/2025,"Feels like a generic scripted American show, like Pawn Stars. Doesn't feel genuine at all and there's really nothing new they're adding.It's more like they're dragging it out, trying to find someone who can add a little drama to fill their thin script.George is trying so hard to sell this, but what new info are we really getting?Every bit of information we get has already been talked about, you're better off going in the deep end on YouTube instead.I don't really have much more to say about this utter horse manure, so I'm just filling up the required quota of words, just like they did with this show.",False
6,10,Great Show from the G.O.A.T. UFO Reporter,Leo-G-Phillips,n/a,16/08/2025,"George Knapp is one of the very first and longest running UFO Journalists. This show does an incredible job of weaving together new investigative segments along with the major incidents for newcomers while adding depth and for some (like the Phoenix Lights) with new information. George is fun to watch, with a nice blend of sincerity and levity - and most importantly he's level headed.One thing I was wondering - why didn't George bring up Bob Lazar, as he was the one who first broke that story?I hope this show continues as ""disclosure"" marches along. It leaves off on a cliff hangar, potentially boding well for a season 2.Thanks for all the hard work, George and Crew!Looking forward to the congressional UAP hearings next week (Nov 13th).",False
7,2,Too staged / scripted,JordB87,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I was excited for this, I was pretty disappointed and underwhelmed. It's so scripted and the host, expert witnesses, and interviewees are all going over the top to sensationalize the topic. They all present far fetched theories based on very little evidence, and prove nothing. Saw a light? Alien. Heard a noise? Alien. Smelled something? Alien. Headache? Alien.I was a bit skeptical going into this docuseries, hoping there would be new information introduced, but it's the same recycled UFO information that has already been made public.This should have been on discovery channel, as it joins the ranks of any other staged show meant to draw the audience in thinking something may actually happen.... It doesn't.",False
8,10,Thrilling and Thought-Provoking Journey into the Unknown!,hzdtvy-35858,n/a,16/08/2025,"Note: Yucat√°n (the upper part of the tail of Mexico) is the area that the meteor that killed the dinosaurs hit...which is close to Tamaulipas. That might be the reason for the UAP activity there.Ijust finished watching Investigative Alien on Netflix, and I'm genuinely impressed! The show dives deep into extraterrestrial mysteries with a unique approach that's both intriguing and suspenseful. Each episode builds the excitement, blending science with investigative reporting that keeps you guessing and eager for more. The investigative team is smart and relatable, making complex theories accessible while adding a touch of humor. It's the perfect mix of thriller and documentary, ideal for anyone interested in the unknown. If you're into mysteries or sci-fi, give Investigative Alien a watch - it's definitely worth the binge.",False
9,3,Super average,muuuvo,n/a,16/08/2025,"The host and his offshoots spend about 70% of the time telling the audience what they plan to do and what they're hoping to do or see. It's just pointless filler and gives the feel of a bubblegum documentary that makes the whole thing feel fake.Despite the underlying information likely being good, this completely misses the mark and could have been presented so much better. The American approach to documentaries is just too emotional and comes across as a reality TV show.Would love to see NatGeo or a non-sensationalist journalist take this on. George Knapp ruins it and seems fixated on creating sensationalist mystique rather than objectively presenting. This is the American way.Very disappointing.",False
10,4,"Nothing new here folks, keep looking up!",tuckercd,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAlien Investigation"" on Netflix falls short of expectations. Despite its intriguing premise, the show fails to deliver any groundbreaking revelations or compelling evidence about extraterrestrial life. The series heavily relies on rehashed theories and familiar UFO sightings, offering nothing new to the genre. The investigative approach feels biased, with a tendency to jump to conclusions without thoroughly exploring alternative explanations. The use of archival footage and eyewitness accounts is overdone and lacks the critical analysis needed to make a convincing case. Overall, ""Alien Investigation"" is more of a missed opportunity than a must-watch. It might entertain those new to the subject, but seasoned UFO enthusiasts will likely find it repetitive and unconvincing..",True
11,10,"The documentary uses a lot of connections, which is admirable.",shawn-60079,n/a,16/08/2025,"I admit that I believe in aliens. Comments on these topics tend to be very polarizing. The person who disbelieves or scoffs almost always says he must see it with his own eyes. They need strong evidence to be convincing, but I believe that even if the evidence is put in front of them, they will always find various reasons to refute it.Of course, we can't blame them. After all, the physical structure of the human brain is such a biological characteristic. Logical thinking and analytical skills are not a problem in themselves. But if you are really a top expert or scholar in science or academia, in the end you will find that the end of science is theology.There are many things that science cannot explain. Science has only proven over and over again that Buddhism existed two centuries ago. Things like quantum mechanics or frequency energy that have been known and described for thousands of years. Even though today's technology is so advanced, there are still many limitations.And, without the involvement of alien technology, what we call science is really just reverse engineering, or finding a possible way to explain phenomena we already know or observe. The sudden emergence of high technology was not something humans thought of themselves.In the past, science was underdeveloped and many things could not be explained. If you had told people a hundred years ago that in the future everyone would be relying on a little box called a cell phone to do a lot of things, you would have been laughed at and criticized.Likewise, those who ridicule or attack things that cannot be proven by today's science are equally blind, arrogant and ridiculous.",False
12,2,Pretty awful,greysky72,n/a,16/08/2025,"I appreciate Knapp and what he's trying to do but this was awful. I didn't like the 'feel' of the show at all, felt forced, overly scripted and sometimes really disingenuous. I don't think they brought forward any new information or proof. They definitely didn't solve anything and even had me rolling my eyes a few times on some 'evidence' they brought forward that was just ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, I'm a believer as I've had my own personal experiences witnessing a few UFOs over the years. Whether they were ET or government craft I couldn't say but crazy either way. Was excited when I saw this show available on Netflix but my enthusiasm died halfway through the first episode and never came back through the rest of the show.",False
13,9,Please do more solo stuff like this George!,mkd-16330,n/a,16/08/2025,FINALLY I CAN ENJOY QUALITY UFO JOURNALISM WITHOUT HAVING TO LISTEN TO JEREMY CORBELL JACK HIMSELF OFF THE WHOLE TIME YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!! This was my favorite ufo documentary in recent years. George asks all the right questions and provides some really interesting evidence. There's only one scene with Jeremy Corbell and this was the best choice ever. The only reason I've ever payed any attention to Corbell is because of Knapp. Taking one star away because I kind of wish it was just George the whole time and not CIA guy and pilot lady also interviewing witnesses. They're much more tolerable than corbel but I felt like they were just there to be skeptical of lies from witnesses rather than ask good questions. Having a skeptic point of view is great but no reason to have cast for that. I think if was just George addressing common skeptic points it would've been perfect. Replacing them with any other respected ufologst like George could've worked better too. George you can tell is a genuine guy and has been an amazing journalist his whole life. I'm so happy we got this treat and I really hope we get another season.,False
14,3,Disappointing and similar to 'Unsolved Mysteries',Amzzo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI just finished watching this series and honestly, it's just another spin on the Unsolved Mysteries formula. Despite the intrigue, the series falls short on solid evidence, relying instead on so-called ""coincidences"" without any logical support.What's particularly frustrating is the way they try to convince viewers that these findings point to aliens or UFOs. They constantly use phrases like, ""Who would do that?"" or ""Why would something or someone do that?"" - as if to imply that no one would ever fake evidence or stage events to look extraterrestrial because it would be ""too insane."" This rhetorical ploy feels like an attempt to dodge meaningful explanations. If they can't make a case without leaning on such vague questions, it's hard to take their conclusions seriously.For the record, I do believe there's something out there. But I have no patience for these cheap Netflix series that try to cash in on the idea without offering anything of real value to the viewer.",True
15,3,"I now have a lot less respect for the Peabody awards, knowing George Knapp is a recipient.",FONYMAHONEY,n/a,16/08/2025,"Now, don't get me wrong - as an avid viewer of practically every Netflix 'documentary', it's fair to say the standard is uneven and I've got zero problem with Netflix diversifying their portfolio to include History channel-level fare. Evidently, there's an audience for it. A big one.But THIS is nonsense to the point of being irresponsible. George Knapp is an utterly insufferable onscreen presence, he can't help but talk in heavy handed cliches. He's so deeply insincere and cringeworthy, he arguably made me even MORE of a skeptic.I'm open to anything, but THIS type of rubbish is why most people believe anybody claiming to have engaged with extraterrestrial life is a gullible idiot fantasist. Maybe that's the point? I doubt it - but this over-egging makes it impossible to take this even remotely seriously, and listing it as a documentary is deeply misleading. And George Knapp is an insincere and tedious conman who should have his journalistic credentials confiscated, beginning with his Peabody award (seriously, HOW?! Was it an inside joke to bestow something on the dumbest person in the business?)If you're just looking for a new, good documentary - don't waste your time. This is not a documentary.

These guys literally provoke the aparition of a UFO, it's filmed and everything.My jaw dropped when I saw that. There's tons more after the first episode that's interesting and exciting, filmed footage, testimonies etc. George Knapp is a respectable journalist, and he does a good job, despite being a bit quick to come to conclusions. He's not one of the weirdos..If you're interested even slightly in the subject, you are going to love this series. Definitely higher than it's current rating, and definitely worth a watch!",True

For anyone new to the subject might have been interesting.Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and I'm a believer. Let's hope George's search for credible information continues and some of the Washington hearings brings up something new.

The idea of all this proof existing out there, never seen before proof and even trusted government people opening up about experiences and proof that exist. Also proof existing throughout time.

This is nothing new, it's the same stories from CREDIBLE EYE WITNESSES. The ""camera smudge"" or aka Jellyfish Video. Should be the epitome of why there is no aliens. It's how you witnessed a camera smudge. You can either see a jelly fish alien floating thru objects... or you forgot to clean the camera lense. How ever you want to interrupt the data. REALLY what is SO surprising, is all the people believing this crap. That's George Knapp's cash cow. The story that never ends.. ALIENS.. Around military installations? Crop circles and cow mutilation, they are checking out what we eat? This is the kind of material you will experience if you waste your time watching this crap. George Knapp find a new story.",False
20,5,This is par for Discovery ch and too produced to be classified as a documentary,orcinussr,n/a,16/08/2025,"For example, with no spoilers, when you have two story lines, two investigations if you will, made to appear to take place simultaneously so we cut back and forth between the dive team and the south American team - the viewer knows this isn't serious - when we have the investigator reinact scenes and fiegn reactions as if it's the first time he's heard this - the viewer knows this isn't a serious documentary - AND IT'S A SERIOUS SUBJECT - but Knapp has been left out in the cold for too many decades and now appears to need vindication and barring that well...

From the very first episode, I was hooked. The pacing is brilliant, the interviews are thought-provoking, and the visuals? Absolutely next-level.What sets this documentary apart is how it manages to remain grounded while exploring topics that are, quite literally, out of this world. It doesn't just rely on shock value or wild speculation-instead, it presents a nuanced, intelligent investigation that treats the subject with both skepticism and open-minded curiosity.Whether you're a lifelong UFO enthusiast or just alien-curious, Investigation Alien is a must-watch.

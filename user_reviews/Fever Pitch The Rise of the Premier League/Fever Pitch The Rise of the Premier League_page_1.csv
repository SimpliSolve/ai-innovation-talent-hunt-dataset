1,9,i used to love...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Football when dalgliesh shilton, clemmens and macdonald ruled the pitch, but coming of age i really feel disgusted by the sport of football or soccer as some call it...being an x-swimmer im more into the aquatics, and except waterpolo im a fan for life... modernj football lacks almost everything, and the things that make football boring seems to be in favour by the executives deciding the rule of the game...i also hate icehockey , more due to the size of the invisible puck and my trebled eyesight, but some of the rules couldve made modern soccer become a gold mine if they took my advice serious... and these are meant for the proffesional leagues¤1 effective playtime, stop being fooled by players doing pingpong and hauling time on own pitchhalf, and extratime given that isnt proportional with the true lenght of time used.stop the clock when the ball is outta play, it might lead to cleaner games and shows the difference of loosers and the fittest of the game#2 use the whole team in every match where substitution of players could commence all the time, like in icehockey, fresher players gives better quality allround.#3 the card rules are stupendously stupid, noone cares anyway and the players get slaughtered anyway. So quit them stupid cards with real punishmentthat may harm the team as a collective, yellow card should in my opinion be granted with 10 minutes on the sideline, leaving the team with 9 fieldplayers, with 3 yellowcard within 10 minutes, well then just 7 teamplayer at the pitch, and that would be like rubbing salt into the sore legs or hips or groins whatever. A red card should be apointed 20 minutes penalty on the sideline and every red should lead to a heavy fine going to a fund that should offer help to every football club outside the league system...¤4 when the attacking team push the football over the centerline of the pitch, the ball cannot be passed back over the line as a defensive draw.if that happens the ball shall be overtaqken by the other team automatically.offensive football is fun and seeworthy,and there are plenty space to roll the ball over there on the other side.Ive got more rules in my head but that i leave for the runner up episodes of this tv series... because its a marvellous etch of a squetch of the british footballs premier league, i shall admit that theyve lit a hope for me to surrender and watch premier league again, but most of all , make a continuation to what has been presented already, i will 100% for sure watch them episodes, a marvel to the sport with emperor cantona and of course weeprince solskjaer. A must see for everybody that watched the 4 o clock saturday matches called ''tippekampen'' here in norway, a tradition that made my dad fall asleep and me dance the victory dance, just wish they could mentioned a weebit about them loosers to, otherwise a grand product and recommended by the grumpy old man.",False
2,6,Fever Pitch! The Rise of the Premier League,studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thus was a nice documentary series about the rise of the Premier League, with lots of key people speaking along the way.It is quite Man U heavy though.",False
3,6,Totally misleading title...a wasted opportunity,JBLOSS,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary series views the history of the Premier League totally through the prism of Manchester United.... The first episode is interesting because it gives good insight on Sky and what they were trying to achieve... by episode 2 it's become a pretty dull account of Man Utd's exploits. It's laughable that teams like Arsenal, Spurs, Liverpool are barely even mentioned in the first 3 programmes. What's even worse is there's NO coverage of what the Premier League meant for the leagues below or for the smaller teams who had to compete against the economic giants.... where are Ipswich, Norwich, Coventry, QPR, Aston Villa, Wimbledon, Crystal Palace etc etc.The series is totally unbalanced and a poor effort at telling the story of an era where football changed utterly. Pretty frustrating that they've made such a hash of it.",False
4,3,Deceptive title,RevisedAndExpanded,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was disappointing. I have to assume the filmmakers intended a Man U documentary, but marketing people decided to bill it as ""the Rise of the Premier League."" Aside from the bulk of the first episode, which is a decent account of the formation of the PL, everything revolves around Man U, and if you like Man U and came for a Man U documentary, I suppose it's okay, but if you want a true documentary about the rise of the Premier League, it is completely lacking in scope.A better documentary about the Premier League could have been done if they had followed multiple teams, because there was far more to these early years than Man U, or even other top teams. There were teams whose fortunes declined. It would have been an interesting contrast. But it's a Man U fishbowl, and not worth the time of anyone whose interest goes beyond one football team.",False
5,1,Documentary that belongs on MUTV,ste-sullivan,n/a,16/08/2025,Rubbish. Should have been called 'Fever Pitch: Rise of Manchester United'. To label it something else is totally disingenuous.,False
6,3,This is a ManU documentary,josecarmona,n/a,16/08/2025,"It misses the spot.Has some interesting points, but it's not the story of the Premier League; it's completely focused on Manchester United.The 4th episode becomes disgusting how much they talk about the Murdoch attempt to acquire United.Arsenal, Newcastle and Blackburn Rovers are mentioned as nemesis of ManU; but misses to mention the arrival of Zola to Chelsea, for example.I have it a 3, because I learned some stuff I wasn't aware of, but it's disappointing.",False
7,5,MIsses the target,gooner-17,n/a,16/08/2025,The should have called it Fever Pitch! The rise of Man United.,False
8,2,A Manchester United™ docuseries,Quasifomo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series chronicles Manchester United's resurgence from 1993 to their treble win in 1999. This coincides with the breakaway, more commercialised Premier League, which combined with Sky TV and other monopolies, for better or worse, to begin a new era in 1992.If you're a football fan you'll notice from the cast list that it's very Man U-heavy. If you're a Man U fan I might recommend it for a rainy day, especially if you remember the period in question - you probably won't learn anything new but the nostalgia's definitely there.There are ocassional shards of interviews with players and others who were not connected to Man U. If you're not a fan of the club or prefer to watch quality, this is a fairly poor, one-sided and one-dimensional series. I've not researched but can only conclude that it's a Manchester United™ product.",False
9,2,"""The Rise of Manchester United""",affekak,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seriously, Who made this? I'm sure United fans going to love it, as it's not that bad. But to call it a story about the Premier League is just a blatant lie. It's ONLY about United! The few times other teams are mentioned it's just to tell how they played against and rivaled United.",False
10,n/a,Complete drivel,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the Manchester United show. There are 20 clubs in the premiership, there were 22 clubs in the premiership during the time period covered by these 4 episodes. The only mention of any other club is in relation to how much Sir Alex Ferguson spat the dummy when he was challenged by anything said or done by someone connected to them.Please don't bother making another season of completely one sided claptrap. That Amazon have been taken in by whoever perpetrated this travesty and have deemed it fit for consumption by the general public is beyond comprehension.This is without doubt the worst representation of English football it has ever been my misfortune to have suffered through.",False
11,1,Utter rubbish,davidssefton,n/a,16/08/2025,The story of the Premier League is most definitely not just the story of Man United (quite the opposite). Slanted nonsense with zero perspective. A teal missed opportunity. Rubbish.,False

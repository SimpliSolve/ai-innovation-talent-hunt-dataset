1,6,Well?.. Did He or Didn't He?,roteme,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFor the majority of the film, it is unclear whether he did have a relationship as he claims, considering this relationship was so unlikely.Very close to the end, it seems that his claims are confirmed; but, this confirmation is only by the reactions of several interviewees to being told that it did, in fact, happen.What was missing was some evidentiary confirmation that will make it clear that this relationship, cast into doubt for the majority of the film, did, in fact, happen.The interviewees to the film are told, apparently, that he did have a relationship as he claimed; so, why are we not told the same?",True
2,6,More Interesting than I Thought,fish6fish,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBefore the end I didn't believe it actually happened. But well, let alone a superstar, if you date a dream girl that you have loved since 8 years old, it could be extremely hard to accept breaking-up. Especially when the girl belongs to one of the most famous bands ever, how could you stop that?I personally think this kind of extreme fixation and obsession should be intervened by his family and friends. It happens to almost every single child and parents are almost obliged to guide their kid towards a correct perspective.It is obviously a fully understandable thing that Agnetha didn't wanna participate in this documentary though.",True
3,10,"He said, she said (love is in the air?)",kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - I mean the title is just ... it almost makes you smile. Even more so if you do not know what the documentary is about. Of course once you do know ... well that is a different beast. I was quite worried about this one ... not that stopped worrying after watching it. But being or having a tendancy to be a stalker is something one has to have in them. In this case there is more than meets the eye ... way more! I was quite surprised by a lot of things this ... well let's say uncovered.That doesn't mean we get the whole truth - there is way too much stuff that can not be said definitively ... and that may make you squirm .. may make you cringe ... may make you uncomfortable! That is the plan - well plan being the operative word! This is not something that seems to have been done or laid out a long time ... who needs help here? Or rather how can we as society try to keep cases like this to a minimum ... or do we need to? Does that come with the territory? Are you likely to believe ... well there is some kind of accountability ... or is it something that was bound to happen anyway? Fame and all that - also .... well I won't go into details, but again, a lot to unpack for sure ... if you like documentaries to challenge you ... well this is it (not the Michael Jackson one - have not seen that one yet)",False
4,n/a,"Good production, bad choice",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was willing to empathise with Gert.But in the end, I didn't.I had a choice: Do I believe him or not?I don't.And the producer's choice to make this documentary some kind of 'jilted lover cannot give up' story with some experts on stalking calling it stalking annoyed me.They produced stalker porn.And they abused Gert as well.Here's questions they chose not to investigate: letters for authenticity, handwriting, police and court records (if they are unavailable, at least say so).All I find online are repeated tabloid stories.Without proof, I am left with the words of a clearly damaged person, whose danger I cannot gauge.Very uncomfortable watch, and not because of the topic.It just feels wrong. And my truth-o-meter works.I feel sullied having watched this, thinking it would be something else.Amazon, correct your 'About' description.",True

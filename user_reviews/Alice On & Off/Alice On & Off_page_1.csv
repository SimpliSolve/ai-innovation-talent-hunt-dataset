1,8,A touching portrayal of modern womanhood,panta-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a rundown apartment in Bucharest, we catch glimpses of someone's life - empty pill bottles, dusty furniture, and art pieces scattered on the walls - all hinting at a past presence. Yet, the occupant, a young woman named Alice, is nowhere to be found. The visitor here is her older ex-boyfriend, desperately searching for her after her sudden disappearance.Spanning over a decade, this film tells Alice's story, a girl who feels unloved and trapped in the life of a young mother. At just 16, she falls for Dorian, who is 35 years her senior. They marry and have a son, Aristo, but the shadows of her neglected childhood loom large. Alice finds herself in a family dynamic where she bears the weight of responsibility for both her child and Dorian, often resorting to video calls while neglecting her own needs. She sacrifices her studies at the Fine Arts University, distances herself from her family, and sees Aristo only sporadically, all while grappling with addiction. This film paints a raw picture of how trauma can echo through generations as Alice fights to stay connected to her son, pursue her dreams, and rediscover herself.Alice On & Off takes a more observational approach rather than a narrative one, yet it offers valuable insights into the woman behind the facade, creating a candid character study of a young woman seeking a better future. Crafted with genuine empathy by someone who clearly admires Alice's journey, the film powerfully addresses contemporary gender issues through the lens of a complex young woman who has often felt invisible, except for the faceless figure who supports her through her online endeavors.Deeply moving and impactful, this film presents a touching portrayal of modern womanhood, brought to life by Isabela.",False

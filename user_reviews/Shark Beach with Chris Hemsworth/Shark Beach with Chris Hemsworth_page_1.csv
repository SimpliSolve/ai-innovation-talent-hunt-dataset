1,8,A thoughtful documentary.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Chris Hemsworth looks at the increase in shark/human activity on the east coast of Australia, he looks at steps being taken to try and reduce the number of attacks.There's one point where Chris talks about the possibility of oceans without sharks, what a chilling thought. I'm pretty much the same age, and also grew up watching Jaws, I think that movie had a huge effect, and instilled a big fear of sharks.Fantastics beasts in the ocean, and I don't just mean Chris Hemsworth, I joke of course, I am a shark lover, I find them fascinating. I love the way that Chris spoke about them, plain to see that he's a shark lover too.A really well made, thoughtful documentary, an engaging hour, 8/10.",False
2,n/a,Informative,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is surprisingly well made. It is very informative, and it shows that there are people who are passionate about shark conservation. This documentary is a great way to raise awareness about conservation and coexistence.",False
3,10,Beautiful film,rox731,n/a,15/08/2025,Beautiful film with amazing info on what they are doing to help keep sharks and people safe. I loved seeing the territory and sharks.,False
4,5,Way too superficial - just a pop-doc,mark-benson,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerConsidering this is 44mins long there could have been some real insight provided in this documentary but it just seems to sell itself on having Chris Hemsworth's dreamy voice and big arms and assumes that's enough to make it a good program. Mick Fannings appearance seemed to be purely on the basis that him and Chris are mates, whereas his part could have been reduced to, no more than, a 1 minute clip.The light insights into the newer drum lines were probably useful to anyone who hasn't been on the DPI website or any of the Australian state shark conservation websites, which maybe most of the audience to be fair but there is zero distinction between 'dangerous' sharks and the more tame/placid ones. Indeed Bull sharks and Tiger sharks are not even mentioned once. Instead the film covers just two very different types of sharks (Whites and Nurse), and for the majority of the program continues to just refer to 'sharks' quite generically as if they are all the same which is a far cry from reality. Val Taylors input was also a nice-to-have but I think her upcoming film should provide a significant amount more insight than her short part in this program.",True
5,9,Go team sharks,ek-44154,n/a,15/08/2025,The documentary as beautiful and really helped me see that they just need to live and that I don't need to be so scared of them. I am glad that Chris Hemsworth got to help and see a great white.,False
6,4,Not much shark in this,ellinormeurk,n/a,15/08/2025,"This felt more like a movie about Hemsworth wanting to make a movie about himself learning more about sharks. Like I did not put this on to se slow motion surfing and him on a hill, I wanted to see more about the sharks and learn more about them.",False
7,4,They are not hurting him?,mercurio-14347,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thought it went too simple into the exploration of sharks and their nature. And in one part they said they werent hurting the shark captured just to show on the program, even if they show you how it is upside down with the hook crossing his skin. Too horrible to see.",False

1,7,Good,atractiveeyes,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a dog lover and someone who loves and has visited Istanbul I was excited to see this documentary. It's nice that it portrays a couple of stray dogs roaming free in the streets of Istanbul along with some Syrian refugees and sheds light on their similar conditions, but it doesn't deliver anything else. It's an interesting and important watch but it feels like something is missing. It needs some interaction and probably some more depth to the plot.",False
2,7,A must-watch for canine fans!,eddie_baggins,n/a,15/08/2025,"In 2016 we got a look at the life of untamed cats that roam the ancient streets of Turkish city Istanbul with the lovable little documentary Kedi, so its only right that now we have a look at the other paw thanks to Elizabeth Lo's documentary Stray, that this time around follows the adventures of wild street dogs including the films main focus Zeytin.Mostly wordless and only featuring humans when its absolutely needed, Stray is literally a dogs eye view of life on the streets of the hustling and bustling city that has a blanket ban on anyone owning or hunting stray animals, meaning dogs just like their feline friends have free reign across the city to explore and enjoy as they rustle out an existence in the harsh but also sometimes beautifully warm world they find themselves in.Proving once more that pictures can tell a thousand words, Lo has done well in keeping Stray in tune with its unique animal centric delivery and while there is no real plot to hold onto in a typical sense of what a narrative might be, Stray never falters in its 70 minute run-time as it holds our attention as Zeytin and her friends Nazar and the adorable puppy Kartal journey alongside one another and some lost human immigrants who all find solace in one another's company.Anyone who counts themselves a dog fan will instantly recognise the human parallels that can be found in this tale and particularly Zeytin's trials and tribulations and whether its about finding ones place in the world or being one of those almost invisible bystanders as life and others pass you by, Stray and Lo have an honest way of exploring everyday life that feels relatable and warm for anyone that lives in the now.The film may've benefited from more focus or a designated end goal but at days end Stray is an often adorable examination of a dogs way of life and one that refuses to shy away from the harsh realities of such an existence, even if the splattering's of warmth and love ensure you as a viewer are reminded that in life, the good often far outweighs the bad if we just keep pressing on.Final Say -Never outstaying its welcome and beautifully capturing life on the streets of Istanbul, warts and all, Stray is a neat companion to the feline Kedi and a must-watch for any die-hard canine fans.3 1/2 bones out of 5.",False
3,6,feels like made by tourists for tourists,tasteoferik,n/a,15/08/2025,"I understand the reason behind the film's appeal to the international audience. It's interesting, if you've never been to turkey. you don't know there are strays roaming? cool, interesting. you don't know there are syrian kids out on the streets, making ends meet? this film is a starter. but other than that, what is there really? and most importantly, what does it really say about either dogs or the refugees? does it even try?the film really feels as though an outsider found themselves in a completely new environment and they were so shocked that they had to observe everything before they could say a word. there are no risks taken, just a camera following the same dogs and kids for an hour and half.if the film's supposed to be about the kids we follow, why not talk to them or get to know their families or give them a chance to speak for the situations they are in? if it's about the strays as it claims, why not interact with people, volunteers, communities that feed them every single day. as it is, it feels like an exotic framing of the most mundane situations for the people and animals that are actually in them. it does not try to learn more, it is just there to film it.as someone who resides in turkey, i thought it was bittersweet to see the kids with their beloved dogs but i can't help but feel a bit betrayed by how lazy both the concept and production were overall.",False
4,7,7 for Zeytin,Rogerstella,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI loved seeing zeytin live on her own terms, but I am mad at production for exploiting certain situations. The crew knew the Syrian kids stole the puppy and instead of helping her reunite with construction-caretaker, they filmed it knowing full well the puppy would have a better life with her family and caretakers. Also when Zeytin was attacked, did they seek medical care for her like Turks there regularly do? If not, that is not fair to Zeytin. Finally, the whole name of the film is incorrect. Zeytin and her friends are not stray. Turkey recognizes a dog and cats' right to live and exist without an owner, unlike here in the US where we feel more civilized because we euthanize millions of healthy animals every year, or force them to be locked in shelters/in a cage, sometimes for years. Again I have a lot of issues with this film but Zeytin is a star.",True
5,7,"Story telling as it's best, with no story!",danmossman,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary film is absolutely terrific, it gives you such an amazing view of Istanbul from just the perspective of the dogs that wonder free in the city. With no words or back story, you feel so emotionally attached to Zeytin and certain other dogs and people she encounters on her travels. A must watch for any animal lover.",False
6,10,Before we go extinct,atilla-73793,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thank you for portraying the realities of being an Istanbul citizen.
Thank you for the healing power this documentary provided me
Its the best documentary since Samsara
I live in the loneliest country in the World. Fear has seperated us from the rest. The stray is our collective hunger for love. Thank you for reminding",False
7,6,Saddness,gaylemoon,n/a,15/08/2025,I was sad to see the dogs on the street. I don't have a clue how it is in that county. I'm a dog lover and I hate to see how the have to roam the streets and fight other dogs. My heart is broken that the homeless is struggling as well as those dogs and so many around the world don't know the love of a owner. Thank you for opening my eyes. Gayle Moon ( United States).,False
8,10,Brillilant documentary that makes you see the value of stepping up for what you believe in,rannynm,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stray is a brilliant film about three beautiful dogs living on the streets of Istanbul, Turkey. Director Elizabeth Lo gives a unique perspective that allows viewers to venture into dogs' lives and learn a lot about the country of Turkey and the people there, as well. Through the eyes of the dogs we learn about their lives on the streets and the lives of others they interact with. We gain a better understanding of the people as we overhear conversations the citizens are having which tell us a lot about the personal lives of the people there and the living conditions. For both the dogs and some of the people, there is danger and the struggle to survive. There are also touching moments. It is an unforgettable film that helps people understand a different part of the world, the people and animals that live there, and that they all have the same basic needs of food, shelter, and friendship.This documentary follows three dogs named Zeytin, Nazar and a puppy named Kartal. The camera follows the dogs at their level which is a very ingenious and a creative touch. As the camera rolls, we follow along and see how these dogs interact with other dogs and the humans they encounter. Not only do we get to experience a stray dog's life, but the lives of a young group of boys also living on the streets. The dogs in Istanbul are allowed to roam around the city freely since the citizens fought to save them. We're taken into these dogs' lives and live it with them, seeing all the sights and sounds they see.One of my favorite scenes in Stray is when Zeytin is in the park and notices another dog approaching. You can tell from the beginning, when we first get to know Zeytin, that she is a sweet dog. She doesn't seem to mind the other dogs she comes in contact with and is friendly towards them. Watching Zeytin and the other dogs in the park was very enjoyable. I just loved watching them run around and being very playful. It is a scene that could have been in any part of the world. I also enjoyed watching the puppy, Kartal. The puppy's expressions are very sweet and, the way people react to Kartal, it adds a nice touch to the film.The message in this film is to step up for what you believe in. The citizens of Turkey made sure their voices were heard, so that dogs can freely roam, and are not to be held captive or destroyed. Every life is worth something. The dogs provide comfort to many people there. There are some warnings. Some scenes can be graphic that go with life on the streets. Some of the topics and language spoken by some of the people is also for older viewers.I give Stray 5 out of 5 stars. I was glued to the screen and I am now a much bigger fan of documentaries after watching this film. I plan to watch more in the future. I recommend this film to ages 13 to 20.

9,6,May seem revealing or just plain boring,isaacochoterena,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary may sound boring, but it may reveal some dog behaviors.At first glance it seems that they are only recording stray dogs, but at the same time it is reflected how faithful they are with those who take care of them and how much they defend themselves from another dog that wants to control them. It also exposes the situation of some stray dogs and how they are seen by the people who walk those streets and by the government. The camera movements are well cared for, positioning the dogs in a way that brings out their physical characteristics.The short duration makes this production more enjoyable, although it does not count much through words, but for those who adore these canines, it may seem beautiful, although in the last part it already becomes a bit boring.",False
10,5,Superficial,oguzhancinar,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before starting to watch the documentary, I thought that it would be about stray dogs and their lives, how they fed by citizens or organisations, or interaction between dogs and people. However, the documentary is completely different. It just superficially mentions the life of a couple of stray dogs and refugees in Turkey.",False
11,10,Great Movie,muhammadiqbaldar,n/a,15/08/2025,This movie gives voices to the voiceless.The story of a Dog and its relation with the humans and the surrounding environment are very pleasing especially in Turkey..,False
12,5,An original idea,drz,n/a,15/08/2025,"... but not much more. A documentary with interesting facts about dogs' lives in Istanbul, some insight into the long canine-human history, a little cautious commentary on refugees and politics. Is it really a movie? I am not sure.",False
13,10,A work of genius,fredphoesh,n/a,15/08/2025,"I absolutely loved this documentary.I'm shocked it is not nominated for best feature documentary at the academy awards 2021.. why?It's an honest look at street dog's lives in Istanbul but as seen from the dog's point of view, both literally, with the camera kept low on a gimbal, and in the narrative, there is no explanation, very little human voice talking, just experiences the dog has in it's day to day life.Wonderful.",False

15,4,No story but lots of Orientalism,johnyawus,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you are looking for a documentary without a story but lots of Orientalism, you came to the right place. Instead of this, Kedi would be a better watch for stray animals in Turkey.",False
16,9,GOOD BOY,js-66130,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just what everyone is missing from their life: more doggie videos.Shot from a wonderful ground level pooch point of view, ""Stray"" follows a wayward pack on the streets of Istanbul as they play, scrap, mooch, befriend, sleep, and just plain struggle to survive. Without context or history, this movie just is. And it is intoxicating.Aligning themselves with another bunch of outcasts - homeless refuge orphans - the canines offer a different take on the man's best friend cliche, one that finds common bond in flight, survival and squatting. In what is a desperate, dangerous, harsh and bleak existence, the pack finds not only solace, but also camaraderie and slivers of unexpected joy.Accentuated by dreamy cello accompaniment, there's a wonderful wordless poetic vibe permeating throughout, creating an enticing, sometimes hypnotic viewing experience. Often the focus of exotic wildlife films, ""Stray"" proves the gymnastic dance of mammal movement also exists on unforgiving city streets.Includes a grand howl to prayer finale so you know you wanna like and subscribe.hipCRANK.",False
17,1,Animal abuse at its best,Mikumi,n/a,15/08/2025,I think this is one of the worst example of observational documentary. Director decide to sideline ethical questions and ignore how she became a harmful subjects for animal. I am sure if she decide to shoot something like that in US or Hong Kong she has to fill enormous of ethic forms to follow stray animals however she just went to a country in where no one cares about what she has done and how she affected a stray puppy's life. This is not a good documentary this is basically a piece about how you shouldn't abuse animals.,False
18,8,Life is hazardous,Mainecoon999,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the story of a lucky stray dog. Not many of them find leftover food or a warm corner to sleep during freezing winter times.

20,1,Elizabeth Lo needs to be imprisoned for promoting dog cruelty,cgtam,n/a,15/08/2025,"Every one involved in this phone camera LOW QUALITY , dizzying, no plot film deserves to be imprisoned for animal cruelty. While filming, owned dogs, notably 1 lovely newborn puppy, is stolen. Pups theft by drug addicted homeless young boys is encouraged by semi homeless man ""to steal any puppy"" from their mother. All are soon stolen & camera person, E. LO, allows this. Worst, she does NOT tell ""searching for days owner"" where the stolen pup is despite possessing pups exact location. Filmmaker Lo allows the stolen young pup to live in misery on streets with drug addicted homeless boys.This film proves how humans are the worst species on this planet. The lead poster tan dog remains homeless after the film. He's only a $$ maker for Lo.All this is occurs in Istanbul supposedly from 2017 to 2019. Thousands of stray dogs are treated like known garbage instead of sentient creatures.All strays share same plight as unwanted children - focus on UNwanted. Turkey stopped mass dog killings in exchange for prolonged misery of its dogs.Skip this film that benefits despicable, greedy filmmaker LO and all producers who profited, showered with many ""film awards"" , & CHOSE TO NOT SAVE/ADOPT 1 single dog, esp lead.Footage is mostly shaky, unwatchable, & at height of 3 feet. This film does NOTHING to aid stray dogs in Istanbul. I fast forward it due to zero plot & amateur crap filmography. Skip this to NOT give more profit to greedy producers, esp LO.",False
21,10,Raw!!!,monberger,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerPeople didn't get it!!! This was not meant to entertain but to see the raw reality of how insensitive people/humanity is against animals and other human beings. This wasn't meant to show organizations know if they are doing something about it or a story with a fake plot to find a reason for things. This is just merely showing the raw misery of how we treat the closest and most faithful animal men ever had, and sadly we turn our backs to them. The children, unfortunately, were there like the dog's living hell on earth. Despite that, They had each other and care for one another. Please, when you see a dog or any animal in general under conditions like that please give a little time and effort to Provide them With love And a meal.Thank you.",True
22,1,Stray dogs walking around,akaygunel,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was expecting something better, something we don't know and we need to know. Stray dogs walking around and a few quotes about why dogs are good and people are bad. This is the whole movie. How can someone say that for a dog to being stray is good? And also, dogs are pooping around and no one cleaning it. This can be cause disease like echinococcosis.Anyone can make a movie(!) like that. Just take a camera and go behind stray dogs. And what was the point of that movie? (Spoiler but not really: there isn't any point)There are plenty of good movies ou there. You can prefer to watch them instead of this thing.Seriously, you call that video a movie?",False

25,5,awful,ThunderKing6,n/a,15/08/2025,A steller documentary product about dogs wandering around in the streets.I feel like producers ran out of ideas and decided to film dirt dogs. Overall.

Umm...about how ewsome dogs are.Verdict: They need to be taken up and placed in a long-lasting home.,False

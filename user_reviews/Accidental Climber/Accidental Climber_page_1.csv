1,6,Mixed feelings (with spoiler),habsphannn,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAt first I thought Jim was being driven by an ego to climb Mt. Everest...and to a point, I think you need one to do something like this.But as the movie continued, I began to hope that he would accomplish this feat.It seemed as if he had finally convinced himself that summit was something he wouldn't be able to reach after he turned around and returned to base camp.But when the climbing was cancelled after the tragic avalanche, Jim went home and told the news cameras that the post-avalanche cancellation was the reason he didn't continue to climb. Sorry but he was a beaten man, as so many are by this great mountain. That's what he should have told the news reporters.",True
2,2,Vacation Blog,holybagpipes-6-153560,n/a,16/08/2025,"This guy ought to be proud of the hard work he did to be in shape at 68 years old. He deserves applause and inspiring for the elderly to be all you can be. The movie is basically a vacation blog. It's not in the same league as Free Solo or Meru or Touching the Void. Perhaps if I was older, I'd appreciate it more but it doesnt inspire me in my fifties.",False
3,2,"Perfect title, a film about a guy who is unprepared",Xavier_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter you get through the first 20 minutes of this documentary you get the feeling this guy has more money than brains. First off, he can't even answer WHY he is going, oh to be the oldest American to summit.A little while longer he is shown hiking some trails in Sacramento then struggling to get acclimated to the high elevation on his trip. Perhaps try googling mountain climbing prior to getting sponsored to climb Everest.Or perhaps try climbing something easier first.Then we see him getting instruction on how to climb across a ladder. This dude was woefully under prepared and it gets annoying. I mean he has his own personal sherpa pushing his big butt up from behind. Not even once does he admit that he had zero chance of reaching anywhere near the summit.This guy could barely make it out of base camp and can't handle the lack of oxygen. He attempts to focus on the accident and this was his get way of saving face.I'm not sure why this film was made, perhaps to highlight the immaturity and inexperience of Americans. This happens every year in mountaineering, nothing new here. 2/10 as there is not much of a story. The ending is strange, this guy is a hero for not even coming close???",True
4,3,Love the idea of climbing Everest but would never be able to.,jarrett-07035,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI'm rich so make a movie about me looking i can't afford it and give me everything to make ot to the top for free,True
5,3,The outcome was obvious,buttbin,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerPoor guy was misled. Should have done some in depth research. I admire him for he's fitness and work to prepare but he forgot one thing AGE. Being old and fit is different from being young and fit. Age catches up with most. Agreed there have been a few oldies summit Mount Everest but few and far between and probably far more experience. To be honest I did expected him to do better than he actually achieved. Think he only managed to get to about 18000 feet not even anywhere near the death zone at around 26000 feet so way off target. After that the really hard part of an additional 2000 feet. The guy sponsoring must have just been thinking about the film making side of things. All credit for trying but that's about it.,True
6,8,Journey to the Mountains,nqmedia,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very candid look at one of the oldest climbers to attempt to make the Everest climb. It goes into how this opportunity came to be and his journey to the mountain including the hardships along the way. It's almost like a home movie except it's about climbing Everest! For people interested in why and how people decide to make a journey and adventure like this, it is an amazing look at the inner workings of a regular person and not so much a sports climber. Also, anyone who's ever wanted to take an adventure like this will also find benefit in this film. The film works better in this regard than of that depicting a more famous person's journey.",False
7,1,Pathetic liar.,kevinm-165,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJim Geiger forgot to ask someone who's actually climbed Everest how to prepare-soberingly UNPREPARED! Hiking at sea level and wishful thinking doesn't get it done.Sadly, Jim realizes he's woefully out of shape in the gift shop and wastes everyone's time going forward.But, the most disgusting part of his documentary is his use of the 2014 Tragedy as the reason he couldn't climb. This guy had absolutely no business being involved with anything having to do with Mt Everest. I'm guessing his family was pretty embarrassed when confronted by viewers who got to witness Jim's footage compared to what he told Media, family and himself. Seriously gross human.",True
8,10,An Inspiring Movie - The Perfect Temporary Antidote for 2020,eldoradohicks,n/a,16/08/2025,"This year has been tough and amazing, just like the star of ""Accidental Climber,"" Jim Geiger. It's so inspiring to see the story of his journey and watch as it leads him to the most important thing in his life, his family. It reminds all of us of our priorities. I've already watched it two times in three nights and can't imagine I won't watch it again a time or two this weekend. Jim is an inspiring person and he really does make you want to better your family, your health and your faith. Share this with everyone you know. It's the best thing to watch to make you forget the frustrations of 2020.",False

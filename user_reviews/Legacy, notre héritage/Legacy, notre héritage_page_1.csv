1,7,The future - uncertain(?),kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - because is it really uncertain? Are we not able to change it? Can't we do something about it? One would hope that we can ... and I would argue we can. Is a movie like this going to change anything? Hard to say - especially when the movie itself recognizes that not much has changed from a previous movie the director has done - well not in any positive fashion ... rather in a negative way.But is it helping to be gloomy? To paint everything black and maybe even resign? I would say no - and I would hope that some people can be reached with this. Though I will not hold my breath .. it is not all bad and this tries to show ways for us to better ourselves ... again, will it reach enough people? Will they care? Considering the state some countries are in one may not be too hopeful ... let's try to stay positive though ...",False

1,7,A special that is nothing more than it needs to be....,PerryAtTheMovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"7/10Does this special truly need a review? Not really. You're either gonna watch it or you're not. I happened to watch it, not because I'm a Sabrina Carpenter fan, but rather I follow her on social media and I'm very entertained by her.My first introduction with her was on ""Girl Meets World"" and I thought she wasn't bad in that. I liked ""Boy Meets World"" and since then I've only followed her from a distance. Honestly this special was not bad. It's funny, it's entertaining, but it's too short. I think given the time she could definitely do a 90 minute special that shows off more of her music.I didn't know many of the guest stars that appeared other than Shania Twain, and very surprisingly, Sean Astin who was a great Santa Clause. It's a simple Christmas special. Sabrina knows what she wants and she delivers it with some quirk. It finishes spectacularly with her great song ""A Nonsense Christmas"" where she still keeps it family friendly.It's honestly a blast of a special. I'll say that honestly as someone who doesn't listen to her songs, but she knows her audience and she knows who's watching and that's what makes it great. Oh, and you learn everything you need to know about her in fifty minutes.... She just wants to be stuffed.",False
2,6,Rewatch Value,fxccvqcz,n/a,15/08/2025,"I enjoyed but know for a fact I won't rewatch. When I think of a Christmas Special it's something you want to watch time and time again when the holidays come around. This is something that feels like an SNL segment, one off. It is missing something and I spent the whole special looking for it. Also the fact that Chappell Roan's end ""blooper"" is her complaining that the outfit she's in is straight is so weird to me when it's Sabrina's special and clearly what she wanted them to wear. The length of the special was perfect with little segments and showing us the behind the scenes of the shots as it's being shot. But again, it was just missing something.",False
3,7,"It's not Ibsen,but",ksubhan-90165,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is special didn't exaclty have me standing up in my seat and calling it true cinema. But,I don't really see why some people seem to hate it as much as they do. It's pretty intentionally cheesy with some predictable jokes but nothing outright bad,you're going to be watching it mostly for the musical numbers and for Sabrina and her guests. It's nothing groundbreaking but it's decent enough as a christmas special. It's just some goofy fun for fans of pop music,and if you're not really into that,or you don't enjoy those cheesy movies like ""The Santa Clause"" or ""Elf"",it's definitely not for you. It's not that serious.",False
4,n/a,A Cringey Christmas,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I actually went into this new Christmas special with a very open mind but I have to say that it was unfortunately a cringey mess and very underwhelming overall. The different guests were probably the best part of the special, but Sabrina's continual reliance on the same corny innuendos and unoriginal shtick becomes boring and uninteresting very quickly. There's a heavy laugh track in the skits too that is distracting and there's also loud backing vocals in the musical numbers that are obvious. Overall everything feels very contrived and ultimately uninspiring. I wouldn't even call this camp, just cringe and corny. I had seen a comment saying that Sabrina is the pop equivalent of the ""hawk tuah"" girl and cashing in on a viral shtick. It ultimately just isn't that entertaining and feels very vapid. I wouldn't recommend this special.",False
5,7,Short and cute,Kingslaay,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a bit of an old soul and never get into new musical artists but I was impressed with the strong talent and lovely voice Sabrina has. She outshines all her guest performers by miles and shows how some of them can't sing a basic song. But Sabrina's wit, charisma, humour and smile is contagious. It should get viewers smiling and easily into a nonsense mood for the holidays. Also kudos to her for taking on this special as there could be fears it would bomb. My only suggestion would have been to include a story to make it more fun for viewers to follow along and have a final song session with all the musical acts. Overall harmless and fun treat.",False
6,10,Solid 10,lp-52759,n/a,15/08/2025,"Don't listen to the haters, it's actually good, have seen it twice, this Xxxl snl with steroids, with cool music and musicians. She is not trying to be Marylin or Madonna, like some one said here, she is her self, funny and a true with her humor and style we love . She has a sense of humor, she loves to sing and entertain, this is about that. The vibe is everything, it's funny, nostalgic, and fun to watch, we need more of this, hope Netflix makes a special of her concert. The fans are going too love this, we get her, and this. It is so her with a holiday vibes. Love every thing about it will watch over and over. Must see.",False
7,2,Cringe and awkward..,Serpico1071,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really don't know what to make of this, it's cringey and awkward to watch for most of it, poorly scripted, but if you love Sabrina Carpenter, you'll probably love this.. but I couldn't get around it, I was waiting to for it to be funny, but it wasn't, plenty of canned laughter though, were the audience paid to laugh at skits that weren't funny? It's like a poor SNL from Temu..
There's plenty of B-lister 'celebrities' to choose from though, with their poorly executed sexual innuendos, Netflix being a bit tight with their budget this year? And It's about 30 minutes too long.. but it's like, 'what is one man's trash is another man's treasure', so some are going to like it, some aren't..",False
8,10,Sabrina Claus,kingstonjohnston,n/a,15/08/2025,"10/10. No notes. Thank you Sabrina for bringing us all a holiday tradition of snuggling up by the fire and watching this masterpiece of a special. Actress Sabrina is finally back as well!!! We missed her so dearly. (Get her back on SNL btw, wth are we doing???) Her vocals, outfits, skits, jokes, and lineup was all so incredibly amazing. She has done it yet again, making hit after hit. I'm in shock that she played Cindy Lou Who? It sounds even more incredible live with the piano and violins. Will be watching many more times in the next few days, that's for sure. I know for sure that everybody who watched this had the best 50mins of their year. Thank you to the singer, actress, comedian, producer, dancer, Sabrina Carpenter!!",False
9,2,Oh dear!,destructor-61011,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well what a complete pile of drivel. Yes, it's supposed to be a Christmas special yet it's like watching one of those really awful BGT auditions where you're just constantly cringing and wishing for it to end (Thank God for the skip forward function)!!Nothing felt ""Festive"" and that's pretty bad!And sorry to say she comes across as a Mariah Carey wannabe and not a very good one.It'll entertain 5 year olds but for anyone older, don't expect much more.It's the writers fault for it being so awful but I'd also look at her own management for allowing her to be sucked into performing this.That's what happens when you surround yourself with ""Yes"" people.It no way a 10 and honestly, 2 stars is being generous.You be the judge.",False
10,8,Nonsensical fun,djdavidandersen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ok, for all the Scrooges giving this a bad review, what exactly were you expecting? An Emmy?? It's a Christmas special. It was 100 percent what you would want and expect. Great cameos, cheesy skits, and shameless puns. The songs were a blast, and full of the innuendos one would expect from Sabrina. Time to lighten up a bit , and enjoy the ride! This is a Christmas special I could see me watching each year. I would love to see other artists have a truly good time without worrying if it looks perfect. The bloopers at the end were a lot of fun too. Bravo to the producers and crew who brought this together!",False
11,1,Unbearably cringe,simevo-20093,n/a,15/08/2025,"I guess if your the sort of vapid moron that enjoys Sabrinas unique brand of trying to look and sound as trashy as possible, whilst simultaneously making that her entire personality, then this is for you.Awkward sketches with celebrity guests? Check.Changing song lyrics so they are rude (you coming down my chimney feels so good) check.Uninspired christmas arrangements. Check.Really embarrassing audience moments. Check.Just the absolute worst thing you can imagine putting on.Just the absolute worst thing you can imagine putting on.Just the absolute worst thing you can imagine putting on.",False
12,8,Loved it but edged at the end,Bookslayer,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerGreat watch super funny, but its really for Sabrina's fans and I don't know if you'd like it if you aren't familiar with her brand of humor. The sketches were cute and her collab with chappell was iconic. Unfortunately she spent the whole special talking about the nonsense outro and then didn't do one so that was disappointing.I don't know what people were talking about disparaging religion but I saw none of that and the only comment I can even think of was her saying merry Christmas happy Hanukkah and Kwanza. There was also a Santa sketch but it was just cheeky and there's nothing particularly religious about that. So anyway I still wouldn't show it to kids but only because Sabrina is known for her double entendre.",True
13,4,Cringe fest but she's singing like a queen,alenacliss,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sabrina is wicked. Her singing is awesome. She can carry off presenting and has a cool aesthetic. Bit this is soooo cringe. It's like a youtuber might have written on the back of a packet of cigarettes. The interludes completely undermine the whole show . It's like some teenagers decided to improv. A Disney show and then play some awful canned laughter over it. I'm not gen z and feel like maybe that's why I literally don't get it ... I think any other gen before or after would hate every single second of this, except the singing. I'm not American either so don't know who the singers are either... Shania twain doesn't look like herself either. Sabrina smashes every song but that's a given x.",False
14,8,Absolutely On-Brand For The Sabrina Carpenter Rise,zkonedog,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sabrina Carpenter may well be on her way to Ariana Grande-like status in the pop music scene. The only reason she isn't there already is because she got trapped in some bad Disney music contracts that forced her to make middling, family-friendly pop for a number of years. Now, freed to pursue her own pursuits, Sabrina leans into that tongue-in-cheek, double entendre brand with this Nonsense Christmas special.Basically, Nonsense Christmas is a collection of 6-7 Sabrina tunes (some of them duets, like with Shania Twain or Chappell Roan, amongst others), with comedy skits interspersed between the musical set pieces.Because Sabrina's whole image is so ""cringe"", it is hard to give an event like this the full 10/10 star treatment. Granted, I don't get too fussed about it because she unapologetically leans into that image, but at times it will have you rolling your eyes as opposed to laughing out loud.How can Carpenter largely get away with this? Because she's got the pipes. Her Fruitcake Christmas mini-album is an absolute holiday masterpiece, and her other tunes of late have rocketed to the top of all charts. Sabrina can really sing, and that's how (at least for the moment) she can get away with the dirty puns and raunchy-if-fun persona--because the vocals always back it up.Overall, I enjoyed this Nonsense Christmas special. Nothing that will go down in the annals of holiday music specials, to be sure, but fun enough in that it knows exactly what it wants to be--Sabrina's pristine vocals mixed with cringy humor--and executes it perfectly.",False
15,8,"I like it so much, love you Sabrina",mfwrdbbn,n/a,15/08/2025,"Opinion on A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter (8/10):I thoroughly enjoyed A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter. The special captures the essence of the holiday spirit with a perfect mix of music, humor, and a cozy, light-hearted atmosphere. Sabrina's energy is infectious, and her musical performances shine, especially with her catchy original songs like A Nonsense Christmas. The integration of Christmas classics, along with her unique spin, brings a fresh twist to the festive season.However, while the humor and musical numbers were engaging, some of the sketches felt a bit over-the-top, which could have been toned down to create a more balanced flow. I also felt that the guest appearances could have been expanded, as they added a fun dynamic but were a bit brief.All in all, A Nonsense Christmas delivers a joyful, quirky experience that fans of Sabrina will appreciate, even if it's not a perfect masterpiece. It's a solid holiday special worth watching for its warmth, charm, and catchy tunes.",False
16,4,COULD HAVE HAD MARIAH CAREY TO DO THIS BUT IT WAS OK,jayshawntoocuteforyou,n/a,15/08/2025,"I enjoy the singing parts of this special, but the skits aren't my favorite. Honestly, I think Mariah Carey would have been a better fit - she's the queen of Christmas and knows how to own the stage not saying Sabrina doesn't, I like Sabrina Carpenter, Mariah Carey would have brought a regal touch to the special plus she's a shady queen and is funny at the same time.I guess most of the singers nowadays is just not for me I'm most of a oldies music type of person so I guess that's why I didn't really enjoy it....but I really like her and tyla's duet it was really good and the last Christmas one.",False
17,10,Fun Christmas special!,breanna_w,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI enjoyed it greatly! For those overly sensitive Christians who think everyone is out to get you even though religion is a choice and you guys (the ones commenting here likely against the show) are really the ones pushing it on everyone and out to get others to the point you bully others for existing (anyways), just don't watch it if you think it's insulting 🙄 Your world will go on. I promise. I bet Jesus had fun and didn't take everything so seriously! Try it . Had to go on this little rant since there's a certain number of characters needed to be able to post.**Actual review**
Loved the guest stars! Chappell was amazing! Loved Shania singing with her too. Would watch again. A fun not serious holiday special :)",True
18,8,That was fun.,jared-25331,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I was a boy, I used to watch Disney Channel a lot and there were a lot of people who started their careers, one of those people was Sabrina Carpenter and now she has has become a big star nowadays. With that being said, I just finished watching A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter (2024) and it was great.Positives for A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter (2024):
This Netflix Special was a lot of fun. You have some good humor that lands most of the time and it's made for adults like me. The songs in this special are great. And finally, this Netflix special can be something that people watch on a yearly bases.Negatives for A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter (2024):
This one of those holiday specials that I can see myself watching one time only. This special was made for people who are fans of Sabrina Carpenter and they'll get something out of it.Overall, A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter (2024) is a fun holiday special that can be enjoyed by a lot of people especially fans of Sabrina Carpenter.",False
19,10,Full of Sabrina's Wit and Charm,jakobkoprivnik,n/a,15/08/2025,"This holiday special is so in Sabrina Carpenter's style, and I absolutely love it! If you're a fan of her music and vibe, you'll enjoy every second of this. She shines throughout the entire special - she's incredibly photogenic and her energy just radiates. The mix of seasonal songs, fun guest appearances, and Sabrina's magnetic presence makes it a feel-good, festive experience.If you're not a fan of Sabrina, though, this is definitely not for you. It's all about her, and she owns it. Honestly, I wish it was longer - I didn't want it to end. It's the perfect way to get into the holiday spirit. Highly recommend it if you're into her style and energy!",False
20,10,Holiday Camp Classic,amh-51222,n/a,15/08/2025,"Honestly, I had so much fun watching this. Maybe the best holiday special I've ever seen? Definitely the most entertaining! So funny and well done throughout. Everyone got the assignment from the guest performers to the costume department to the set designers to the cinematographers to the unexpected Sean Astin cameo as Santa. Sabrina effortlessly carries the whole show on her tiny, scantily clad back. If you are a lover of camp, the holidays, Saturday Night Live, Sabrina Carpenter, or all the above then you've got to check it out! I will be watching this special every holiday season for years to come!",False
21,10,One of the best I've ever watched!,cassthomp,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sabrina has a way of being soooooooooo insanely funny and not making it feel cheesy. It feels more like her fun, comedic personality and I'm obsessed with the approach she brought with this special. It was soooo well done, and the special guests were perfect and brought so much festivity and unique aspects that created a holiday feel. I'm so in love with A Nonsense Christmas and the hilarious bits Sabrina added to make it one of a kind. She uses the best outfits and creates such a fun feel to every bit she's in. I loveeeee her humor and would say she absolutely killed this performance! I HIGHLY recommend!! 💜",False
22,9,Silly Fun Time,litxulimadrigal2003,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI want to say that this was a fun watch. I am a Sabrina Carpenter fan and I definitely think this was very catered towards fans of hers. It was very silly and I did giggle a lot and aesthetically it was very nice to look at. I loved all of the outfits. I think for the first time, Sabrina's skits were good. Not perfect but great.I would say out of all the celebrity appearances, I think Santa Baby with Shania Twain was a bit off to me. Both are amazing singers. I just think it should have been more on beat like Sabrina.All in all, I would definitely watch this again during the holidays or when I need a good short comfort film. I definitely feel like a woman when I listen to Sabrina. She is catered to us women who are older. Her adult jokes were perfect. She definitely got me in the Christmas mood.",True
23,8,There are much much worse ways to spend an hour.,Victor Field,n/a,15/08/2025,"""A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter"" is fun for fans. I'm glad I wasn't watching with someone who has no idea about her ""Nonsense"" outros... although I can't imagine anyone who isn't at least a bit interested in her watching this. The skits are entertaining, and you know ""Smash Hits"" still existed, she'd have fit its aesthetic like a glove. Unfortunately she still can't make ""Santa Baby"" a good song. The prospect of her doing a Netflix Christmas movie wouldn't be a bad thing to manifest. It doesn't even need to be music-oriented. She certainly has the acting and comedy chops. Who doesn't like a multi-talented pocket rocket.",False
24,9,Rewatch value,chloemaggray,n/a,15/08/2025,"This special isn't what I expected but I love it. There are funny skits and some spectacular musical pieces - covers - that have come out of it. Easily something to throw on in the background on repeat during a christmas baking session. Love, love, love it. It doesn't have a storyline like other movies, which is maybe more of what I expected (a movie) but I still think it turned out incredibly well! I liked how much of her personality this special held. Never heard christmas songs sound so good!! It held my attention the whole way through, which is unusal for me since I would normally be on my phone at the same time. I will definitely replay this year after year.",False

1,7,Review of the Series NOT the Man,jasonmschofield,n/a,15/08/2025,"First I have to say IGNORE THE HATERS!!! If you read the reviews so far they are about Gates himself NOT the series. People leaving reviews need to focus on why people read the reviews, and that's to find out if the series is any good or not. I can dislike a person with everything in me. But if they say ""putting your hand in the fire will burn you"" that doesn't mean they're wrong. I also wouldn't just instantly dismiss them either, as these 'hosts' pretty much are just the talking heads not the researchers, writer's, etc. Still with me? Alright, let's review the series now.The series itself is thought provoking and at times pretty insightful. That being said, it's nothing special to write home about but isn't terrible either. Honestly, it's a series touching on issues in a way that tries to be as middle of the road as possible. I believe the approach is to try not to alienate any one ""side"" of things. That being said, this is where it tends to loose out, instead of going all in the topics the series holds a lot back in their attempts to not upset anyone and not be political. While that in and of itself is a good thing in this day in age, it causes the series to not go far enough on the issues it's discussing.I'd say this is a good series to play in the background while doing something, and a better series to watch as you're settling in for the night. Engaging enough to keep you interested, but also not enough to overstimulate you or really draw your attention from other things.",False
2,7,Promotional vehicle for Gates Foundation is better than score indicates,kgratton,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerToo many plain, simple folk have skewed the rating for this Netflix series out of their inexplicable hatred for the presenter, Bill Gates.As someone who has sworn at Gates for Windows Vista, but also praised Microsoft Word and Excel, I am prepared to acknowledge that Gates is neither saint nor sinner.In this series, he strikes the right tone as a passive interviewer (too passive with Bernie Sanders perhaps), but also contributes his own views and explains his motivations.As much as the series publicises the work of Gates and his foundation, it remains interesting. I knew nothing of the work done in Africa to reduce the impact of malaria, which is covered in precisely the right level of detail to make it entertaining and enlightening.That same level of detail is arguably missing in the earlier episodes, concerning AI, misinformation, climate change and social equality. I would have liked to hear solutions from Sanders, for instance. All of these episodes could have drilled a bit deeper, but then the producers would have to extend the run time accordingly.Where these episodes work is as a jumping-off point for further investigation. If the episode concerning AI is intriguing, but seems to brush over the subject lightly, the viewer can look for other documentaries on the subject. And that's not a bad thing.Finally, a word on the animus of the reviewers for this series: The plot outline on IMDB is: ""Super rich White male pretends to care.""The reviewing for this series has plainly been hijacked by Apple Mac users or QAnon. So take the score (4.5 currently) with a grain of salt. Give it a go; if you don't enjoy it from the first episode, you can always join the baying mob...",True
3,9,Hopeful...,dominiccilli,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow A bunch of negative reviews from people who actually think they are ""through the looking glass"" in regards to Bill Gates without actually looking into the man's actions while simply listening to rumor and inuendo about Gates. Put it simply, this man has done more for society than any other Billionaire in recent memory. The giving pledge is 100% proof of that. And I'll tell the naysayers to once again , believe in the actions, not the rumor and stop sitting in your rabbit hole and following your social media feeds and thinking you know something that no one else does. The list of this mans contributions to the WORLD would fill an encyclopedia and this documentary shows us a future that may not be as grim as people think. He shows us what the future could be by tackling issues like Global Warming, Disease, AI and extreme wealth. I came away feeling hopeful for our future after watching this. These episodes are the most important issues the future of mankind has to deal with and instead of bashing the man lets credit the FACT the he is thinking of them and more importantly DOING something about it and give credit where its due.",False
4,n/a,Watch and think,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am exactly Bill's age. I am a retired librarian and IT professional. But I'm by no means wealthy (bless Social Security and Medicare). So in short I don't have a lot in common with him other than our age.Nevertheless I pay attention. I know what his Foundation has been doing. I watched his Town Halls with Anderson Cooper during the pandemic. And we were fortunate to have him at that time. Many have forgotten how scary it was. The lonely, secluded deaths in the hospitals. The freezer truck morgues. The empty shelves at the grocery. The loneliness.It is really hard as you get old to keep an open mind and preserve your sense of curiosity. Doing those things can be exhausting.But Bill shows us precisely (and with no qualms as to how he appears) that it is good to be curious and to be open minded, even if it is hard and tiring. He is energetic in his pursuit of reality.It's good for us to think and to rethink. And then to think again.This series is for sure not what I expected. I did not expect Bill to interview people like James Cameron and Bernie Sanders. I was very much impressed and envious of his path. I'd love to sit in a room with Cameron and talk AI.I thought it was interesting watching him sit in a room and listen to entrepreneurs talk about AI. He took notes with paper and pen. The old fashion way and the way I truly believe is the best way: paper to pen to fingers to hand to arm to eyes to brain. I think that path sticks better than typing.Also, there really are no answers provided here. These episodes are meant to be thought provoking discussions. They are meant perhaps to move us forward on finding solutions.These solutions and life itself are fluid and changing (even if we don't like change). Bill is good at both adopting and adapting. It is how we will survive and maybe save our planet.As I mentioned I am exactly Bill's age. I am at the point in life where my medical issues are bringing my end closer and closer. I am glad we still have Bill. And that he's willing to put himself out there as he continues to learn and continues to be a force of good on this planet.",False
5,3,Is this series about our future or Bill Gates future?,Beachbum2018,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched the first two episodes and am confused at best, whilst Bull does attempt to focus on relevant topical issues, the content and discussion on those topics is a very light, instead the program seems to be more intent on portraying Bill as a nice guy, concerned humerous man and all round good egg!But that's not the point of such programs, if he wants to focus on the serious issues then you'd expect to hardly see his face on the screen at all, it would be more those he's interviewing or contributing plus video clips about the topic. Compare this to a David Attenborough program and you'll understand what I mean.Instead we seem to be invited to be a fly in the wall in a 'typical' day in the life of BG as he swans around meeting Uber wealthy people, conversing in language that's hardly common place, and almost laughing constantly whilst talking about serious topics. For example he brings up all the criticisms we know about like vaccines, land, etc, but doesn't really say much to elaborate on them.... so why not just say why he's buying up so much land, he'll not be around much longer in the bigger scheme of things so what's the philanthropic objective!To say it's all a bit weird is putting it mildly... it's creepy! This seems to be trying to a PR shot in the arm for Bill, the question is why should he be concerned about doing that..... he's amongst the wealthiest people on the planet and likes to be seen to be doing his philanthropic bit for humanity, but he doesn't need a public image to do that..... just get on with it silently!Hasn't helped Bill's image at all for me and I'm not much more informed about the subject matter than I was before watching this!",False
6,8,Why so many bad reviews?,brenzbrenz,n/a,15/08/2025,"I guess I am out of touch with social media and all the hate against Bill Gates. Suppose I have missed out on all that has been said about him. I found the series really interesting and all the things said about him that I never knew, which was discussed in the show. Some of it seemed really far fetched and sad he got ridiculed for something he didn't say or do or had his words twisted. Sad the world started following the lies and next thing he is the worst person in the world. I think Bill Gates is a great man, I remembering him for being the creator of Microsoft and not all this other stuff they started saying about him. Sad too many people trust what is said on social media and then go on to ruin his reputation! I think he is a very smart man and this series shows that where it was funny at times plus serious and very eye opening of our future. Especially what is being put out there on social media. This series is worth a watch if you can put aside any negative things you've heard about Bill Gates. Rate the series not Bill Gates.",False
7,8,Don't listen to bad reviews,mrouttt,n/a,15/08/2025,"All those who put a 1/10 on this series must be among people who believe the immensely stupid conspiracy theories listed in the second episode. If you believe in ""microchip 5G coronavirus masterplan by lizards"", I suggest you go back to school before watching this series and make stupid comment.The series explore how the next generation of AI will make a profound change in our society. A lot of speakers from the tech, cinema and others discuss various aspects of this deep and complex subject.One aspect discuss here in depth is the alarming spread of fake news and how people jump on it with no insight what so ever. And if you don't believe it a huge problem, just read the hate reviews on that very website.",False
8,9,Thought provoking with a Reality Bias,blondton,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very accurate observations of the current society and the age of misinformation. Ignore the low reviews; those folks just feel personally attacked. People can't seem to accept that reality has a liberal bias.The internet has really shaped the way people think, the way they perceive reality and interact with others. It's important that we try to find ways to ensure accountability in actions and fairness in reporting. Episode 2 addresses just that. If you aren't frightened by intellect, you will find this show thought provoking.I'm 66 words short of being able to post this review but frankly, I'm already done.",False
9,2,Misinformation and fearmongering,kikoteixeira,n/a,15/08/2025,"Given that this is Bill Gates, Front and Center I was expecting a TV series with more integrity. It seems that the producers for this show used interviews with Bill Gates, which I agree with and are mostly coherent, and mixed it up with a pretty heavy dose of misinformation and fearmongering.The egregious errors in the first episode of the show alone are too many to list here. But for example, the slideshow where the speaker is ascertaining how super intelligent AI is going to come about and how it is going to surpass human capacity is pure speculation. Society deserves a nuanced approach by the so-called experts.",False
10,10,Don't listen to all the haters.. this is a good series,boblooks,n/a,15/08/2025,It's a shame self-serving billionaires who compete with Bill Gates businesses and authoritarian populist presidential candidates like Trump have normalized hate against smart people who have proven they can improve the world & want to continue doing it. They want you to hate science that can help you & are jealous that a man finds a way to improve the world and profit on it at the same time which is the best way for things to work in a capitalist world. Trump has at least exposed how huge a percent of people are impressionable suggestible myopic idiots. The irony of it all is Gates will improve the lives of the people who have been disinformed into hating him.,False
11,10,"If you're not a troll, you'll like this series",patbeau-27667,n/a,15/08/2025,"Everything make sense in this series. Elwe just need more billionaire to take example on Bill Gate and contribute more without thinking about profit. All the bad reviews here are made by people who clearly didn't watch the entire series period. If all the ultra rich people in this world would contribute in giving a huge chunk of their wealth to science and technology, they could eradicate poverty, create a better future for everyone, cure disease and as a society we will live longer and better. Money roule this world and if you're ultra rich and you dont use your money to create a better world then you dont deserve that money at all.",False
12,10,Excellent Series,catschasemice9594,n/a,15/08/2025,"A measured look at future tech and how it can solve problems. I'd like to see more of these Netflix documentaries aimed ar looking at subjects like AI, poverty, and health care. I'd also like to see rural problems covered. How do we give better cheaper access to the internet, build affordable housing and manage fire. I'm surprised at the number of reviews giving the series one star. Pretty sure these are right wingers who did not bother to watch the series. I guess a lot of folks don't like Bill Gates. I admire him for what he's trying to do for America. He's a true patriot. We need more philanthropists willing to put money into making the world more sustainable.",False
13,3,Interesting but they make it political and lean a specific way,cjtriv,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't mind Bill Gates and I think this type of content is interesting. But... you can tell that this is meant to have a fairly political message in it at the same time. And it happens to be released right before an election. You can tell by the people they interview, clips they play and words they use.I wish they would make unbiased and neutral.It's hard to make anything nowadays that doesn't have a political message built into it. They are clever in this and try to hide it but it's easy to sniff out.My review would be higher if this wasn't political and trying to bury a political message inside of it but unfortunately that's the route they took and it ruins the doc for me.",False
14,8,Good Documentary,shubhamjanhere,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was good. However, I did not like EP3 where he spoke about climate change. Why? Because we need to work on changing our ways to make Earth more livable, and it is never about making Earth ""MORE LIVABLE"" by changing our technology. Our tech does not defines us - it is our constraint, our limitation. Our tech is not the way we interact with the world - it is the medium through which we interact with the world. Our ways of bypassing tech is what will make Earth more livable. Like? We have bypassed the technology of fossil fuels by using horse carts. Just kidding. We have surpassed the technology of fossil fuels with the E10 blend (having 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline). We have eliminated the need for diarrhea vaccination with cheap drugs and ORS. Sometimes, the apparent solution is not what we need - sometimes, we need to change our problem itself. Rather than telling me how to stop carbon emissions by not using gasoline, he could have told me a better problem - vote for the government that offers robust public transportation in the next election.Also, in EP4, he could have told about the following YouTube video - Peter Schiff at Occupy Wall Street ""I am the 1%. Let's Talk"".",True
15,10,Excellent Infomercial,whereistania-00982,n/a,15/08/2025,"Anyone with an ounce of intelligence will recognise that this Netflix series is a PR Puff Piece and an exercise in 'Nudging'. That said producer Jen Krajicek of Gates Ventures does an excellent job with this exemplary work. Unless you have been buried under a rock you'll know that Gates elicits strong love and hate responses yet this series portrays Gates as a benign kind of cheeky chap, soft balling hardball issues in a pseudo intellectual non offensive way and not looking at all lizard like. My only criticism is that I pay Netflix a subscription to go ad free and this is one very long advertisement for a product we don't really need.",False
16,9,I found it interesting and transparent,gustavodelgadov,n/a,15/08/2025,"I liked this show. It explains some very big problems that the world is facing right now.I noticed that in all of those problems there are something related to Gates (either his vaccines rumours, his Billionaire status, his foundation, etc.), I appreciated that he answer and talks pretty frontal about some of this rumours and controversies.I don't really get the hate towards Bill Gates. I find him smart and interesting. It seems that he is the figure that most people chose to attack in representation of all billionaires.I would suggest to enjoy the show and the information, which is good. If you hate Gates it doesn't make this a bad show.",False
17,3,Flat,Withnail81,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary is flat. It relies heavily on the charisma and ideas of Bill Gates. The problem is that he comes off as a mild and warm old man with ideas that are not very thought provoking or deep. It actually made me think that this documentary could already have been made by AI, because it is lacking in creativity, soul and philosophical perspective, but it contains a whole lot of knowledge and well-known ideas from before.Gates could have carried a show like this on one condition only: If he set out to actually go through with a big and ambitious business project, breaking new ground to solve some specific issue. That could have brought something interesting to the table. As it now stands, he seems like a very calm and comfortable, but quite boring, character who is a bit to eager to present himself as some sort of virtuous genius. This is not convincing. If you want to see a person like that you should watch something about Mandela :)",False
18,10,Very interesting series,travis-988-242257,n/a,15/08/2025,"Deep dive on several relevant topics. I have a better appreciation for what Gates is trying to accomplish after watching. Several reviews criticize the series as being too far left leaning. Well, the left is the one tackling these issues, so a perceived lean is unavoidable. If you don't think these issues are real, then you probably aren't seeking out this sort of series anyway. But what blows me away is that those that are right leaning are the ones most severely impacted by these very issues. Climate change will impact the southeast of the US the hardest. That is where the greatest concentration of poor and right leaning live. Taxing the rich would ultimately reduce the tax burden on the poor, but the poor right are aligned with a party that defends the wealthy over all else. Poor communities are hit hardest by disease, but the poor right are generally where you find anti-vax conservative views. It's just blind loyalty to a party. Blind partisanship is what will destroy this country. Skepticism of all politicians is necessary. Watch this series with an open mind and consider how you and yours are affected then act accordingly.",False
19,8,Take what you will,xfzpkqdmv,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is political. Some could get triggered. If you watch it, disregard the opinions, and fact check what you disagree with or are skeptical of.There's high production value, so it's at least entertaining.I like that each episode tries to start a conversation about the worst issues facing our world and shows different ways that the proposed problems could be solved.Some may disagree that the problems need solving, but it's interesting to see solutions if you entertain the premise, alongside potential downfalls.The attempt to showcase first hand perspectives seemed forced at times, but was appreciated.If going by the numbers and data presented in the series, Bill Gates has saved a LOT of people's lives and I think that counts for quite a bit. The future is going to be different in ways no one could entirely predict. But, human culture is evolving in bounds due to *insane communications improvements. We really need to get better at genuinely communicating or all these big problems could stop us in our tracks before we have the first conversation.",False

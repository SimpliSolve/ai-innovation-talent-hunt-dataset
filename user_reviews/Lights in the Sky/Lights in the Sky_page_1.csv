1,6,A different approach to the UFO subject,gregflakus,n/a,15/08/2025,"Given the low budget of this film and the fact that it appears it was almost completely the work of one person, Krista Alexander, this is a remarkable little film. But the viewer will find something special by taking the time to follow the presentation and the theories she explores.What sets this film apart from other films about UFOs and alleged extraterrestrials visiting earth is that it does not go for the sensational at all. Alexander uses her video work skills to analyze clips of various sightings and finds patterns that are common in nature, in space and in the strange world of quantum mechanics. She posits the idea that the strange lights people have been seeing in the skies could be manifestations of natural phenomena.The film starts off a little slow with images of flickering lights and a dry narration, but after she gets into the body of her argument, it gets interesting. It may not be satisfying for people who really want to believe these strange sights in the sky are alien visitors, but it provides a look into fascinating theories about the forces that lie beneath what we perceive as the world.",False
2,5,5 out of 10 She should have consulted an expert,tbaymufon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Being the National Chief Investigator for the largest UFO agency in the world, brought my attention to Steve's videos.After some basic investigation, I quickly found the source of his UFOs.I showed him the radar data from the exact day, time and location in his video where he captured the ""ball of energy"" supposedly beaming something down and back to the craft.Well, it turns out, the LVPD conduct their rope rescue training exercises in the exact spot, quite frequently.After providing him with the Radar data, he said he it couldn't be a helicopter.Yet the navigation lights are quite visible in the video.I then contacted LVPD via email and got confirmation from them that they were conducting their training exercises, as usual at this spot.I provided the emails and radar data confirming it was LVPD Helicopter N145DV to Steve.Then to eliminate any further doubt, I got in contact with a two other local residents in the same area. Both said they can usually hear the helicopter echoing off the rock face when its flying back and forth at the mountain range.As for the rest of the movie, I appreciate the fact that this was intended to bring positive attention to the UFO topic.Which is a very real phenomena.However, there are just too many instances in this Doc that further muddy the waters of this field.I wish Krista would had consulted an actual, legitimate UFO investigator to verify the videos she looked at and who could vouch for their authenticity.As for the viewers, beware, there are a lot of charlatans in this field.People trying to capitalize of your want to believe we are not alone.The easiest way to get legitimate UFO footage for analysis is by joining a reputable UFO reporting agency.I hope this review answers some questions and helps some people.",False
3,5,Fascinating.... if it's not a Hoax; and that's a Big IF.,elrushbo-72646,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSomething about the infrared footage, and all the zoom-ins and different colors, raises some alarm bells for me. But up to this point, I'm still all on board. There's so many legit pictures and videos coming out these days, that I'm still on board. But THEN, we get to the insect-shapes and I see immediately that they all look suspiciously like Atari animation. Like beta, reject Atari scraps from 40 years ago. And I begin to feel like this lady is just laughing at me now. It's all the asses out there faking everything, who call into question (and doubt) the real, legitimate footage (which, at this point, can't be denied by honest hearts and minds).",True
4,1,Really???,napaguy-23785,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a waste of time. She zooms in on low quality videos, which creates blobs from the aircraft beacons and landing lights. The only conclusion you can draw is these blobs are pure energy, or UFOs. Makes the comment on a video of a helicopter miles in the distance, ""you cant see any wings or blades"" dont know if she has ever seen a helicopter in real life, but the ""blades"" spin REALLY fast and you can't see them, let alone from miles away.",False
5,1,The dumbness of this film will cause uncontrollable twitching,browning-37062,n/a,15/08/2025,"I paid $5 on Apple TV, because this was described as a documentary of the drones spotted over northern Colorado. My parents live there and the story is interesting. This film is a pathetic, unscientific, and illogical forced march into idiocy. The film begins with the lady using her edition of Final Cut Pro (she seems super proud of it) to ""analyze"" extremely poor quality footage of the lights flying in formation.Note: anyone with a smart phone, or even basic knowledge of photo editing can do what she's doing.Using the software, she zoomed in on the lights, and light any object in a bad picture it looks like a fuzzy ball. She claims this proves they are balls of ""pure energy."" Using the software she adjusts the contrast and notes the changes in colors in the lights. The amazing thing is that the changes did the same thing to the other objects (houses etc) in the photo. Then she continues on in a condescending tone, noting how people who disagree simply refuse the truth. Honestly, I'm not opposed to the notion of UFO's and alien life. There are some accounts that are convincing - cf the Netflix documentary on the man who worked at Area 51. This , however, is simply crap. There is nothing interesting or new or even carefully considered in this film. It's just a lady's delusion about lights in the night sky. It has all the evidence of playing a vinyl record backwards to see if you can hear a message from a spirit realm.I'm appalled that Apple has this listed for weeks, and with such a misleading discription. My only thought through this was 'I miss my five dollars, and I hope my five dollars didn't die in vain'. This is awful and painful to listen to.",False
6,1,Shockingly useless.,stevekimdc,n/a,15/08/2025,"An amateur video editor zooms in on low resolution footage of lights. She then applies brightness and contrast filters and mistakes the resulting video noise & artifacts for usable information. Slightly amusing for the first few minutes, then incredibly sad and disappointing.",False
7,1,Pure nonsense and total waste of time,jneiberger-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you enjoy people who have no idea what they're doing making ""documentaries"" and spouting nonsense with zero expertise then this is the movie for you.Otherwise, just skip it. This lady has no idea at all what she's doing and it's obvious within the first few minutes. I can't stress this enough. She literally has no idea how to analyze videos and images. I had heard about the drones in Colorado and thought this might finally have an explanation, but nope. Do not waste your time.",False
8,9,Great documentary! People are sour!,jamiemowglicox,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a great documentary and more people should be doing things like this.At the least it shows great passion for her work and the ufo subject....
Some peoples reviews are ridiculous.",False
9,7,"I admire this, it's a start in the right direction",kylebushnell,n/a,15/08/2025,"The only review I saw, claimed that he thought it was a drone documentary, frankly I haven't seen anywhere where it says that and actually it's far more interesting and compelling than any drone documentary could be. I knew exactly what this was going to be considering I'm into the topic of UFOs and UAPs (including lights and orbs), Has any one who really wants to take a couple moments and look up the current status on UFOs It's highly real factual, objective not subjective as so much of this world likes to confuse the two but I digress. Low budget one person leads to an underwhelming experience a little BUT The topic is very compelling and it's rather short in length The topic is very compelling and it's rather short in length(given the production it should be). There's a lot of speculation but frankly that's all we can do even people like me who research the topic essentially every day unless more main stream science recognizes these incredible unknown sciences. The hunt for Skinwalker Ranch is another look at phenomenon similar to this (and even more though)... i'm giving this a seven when I get give it 6, but it's seemingly gets no credit at all and I commend this person for as tesla one said, ""The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all previous centuries of its existence.""",False
10,n/a,Unwatchable drivel.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Zooming in on low-quality footage with ""professional editing software, of something that was a speck in said low-quality footage, then changing the contrast and concluding that said object is ""pure energy"", is ludicrous. It's possible that if you are young, dumb, and high, you will believe this codswallop.",False
11,1,I just can't even...,rwfanj,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerEverybody involved with this so called ""documentary"" should be totally ashamed. I honestly don't know if this short film is meant to be taken seriously OR if it is simply an attempt at trolling. The majority of the ""mysterious lights"" shown early in the video are easily identifiable aircraft landing lights & strobes, satellites, etc. The blatant misuse of light spectrum analysis software at the beginning is laughable.
The archive information that they show is interesting as is the US Navy/DOD gun camera footage (which is still unexplained)...but it's nothing new.
All in all it's just a very silly waste of an hour's time.",True
12,10,Loved it!,corriveauc,n/a,15/08/2025,I enjoyed it! I actually watched it several times. I have friends who are looking at the sky as well and this kind of gave us confirmation that we're not the only ones seeing strange things up there. I'm glad folks are opening up conversations and showing videos and discussing possibilities and theories. I thought the entire movie was interesting and fun to watch. I think I may watch it again. For the naysayers and armchair critics I'll be waiting to watch your movies that you've taken the time and energy to produce. Great job Krista. I'll be waiting patiently to see your next movie! Keep them coming! 😁👍💜,False
13,1,Don't watch.,glenswebber,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis purports to became documentary with answers about the Colorado drones. It is not.The short version is this women misuses basic video editing software, to further distort poor quality video in order to show these drones are in fact ""balls of energy"".Its exactly that stupid. You could do the same on your phone with a video of almost anything.I found this on prime video, there are more interesting paranormal or UFO programs to watch there. Do yourself a favor and watch one.",True
14,10,Amazing new perspective!,farroutkelly,n/a,15/08/2025,"She does not draw conclusions. Represents herself honestly. Draws ideas from every major scientific studies known.
Brilliant young lady!",False
15,8,Do not let the naysayers discourage your viewing,jwhainey,n/a,15/08/2025,This film is an honest approach to seeking answers to the qustion of what people are seeing in the skies. The perspectives shared are worth the time to listen and there were several theories postulated that I have never heard expressed. Take the time to watch this and form your own opinions,False
16,10,Wonderfully thought provoking and original offering from a brilliant young jounalist and film maker.,drjeremyrobson,n/a,15/08/2025,"I came across Lights in the Sky accidentally in the first instance. It's rare for me to watch any film several times over. The questions Krista Alexander asks are considered, insightful and highly thoughts provoking about phenomena that need to be understood. She doesn't make the sorts of assumptions that other film makers working in this domain do so frequently. I look forward to more of Ms Alexander's films in the future. I've recommended this film to a great many others who have enjoyed it immensely.",False
17,8,I really enjoyed this,Golightly678,n/a,15/08/2025,This is a great indie documentary. Highly quality content. Very interesting perspectives. The editing was well done. Creator is the narration and face to the film. Overall i very much enjoyed it. Would recommend to the paranormal alien crowd for sure.,False
18,9,Outstanding research,mattfeit,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this documentary, the amount of time she took to research and inform the viewers is greatly appreciated!! Do not listen to the naysayers, this documentary is informative and well worth the time to watch. Thank you",False
19,10,Excellent show for your 2020 needs!,libertyrings,n/a,15/08/2025,This hit home for me in several ways and was very well done. I highly recommend. The ideas are compelling and the documentary had a nice flow to it. I really enjoyed it and will be investigating some of the theories presented.,False
20,8,Not all lights reveal.,jstroud-58190,n/a,15/08/2025,"In her great video, in the same vane as the likes of Jim Delatoso and Dr. Bruce Macabe, Ms. Alexander gives us all a blurred, high-tech truth! A truth in the annals of cutting-edge sciences and those who study them are finally starting to admit openly. That if an object or thing from a neighboring dimension just popped into our own, there'd be no way we would ever recognize it for what it really was. Just as a person would not recognize a jellyfish they saw for the first time, on the dry sand of a beach.",False
21,8,Pretty good stuff. Enjoyable and refreshing.,FunkCatBrown,n/a,15/08/2025,I really enjoyed this film. It showed different stuff and had some perspectives of physicists and quantum theory. The grid stuff and 2 dimension beings also was an idea I had never thought of or seen. Also it's refreshing to have a UFO film made by a female. I hope she makes another film. Also great to see my friend Steve Barrone's awesome footage analyzed. He gets some very interesting stuff on the outskirts of Vegas. Much love.,False
22,9,"Cool, Creepy, Mysterious Stuff!",night426,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't understand all the negativity in some of the reviews. She used her brain, and the tools she had available to her and did something no one else has done. What her film lacks in polished presentation doesn't matter to me. I don't believe any of the people mocking this film can explain all the weird questions she has posed. I really hate bullies, and you seem like a bunch of self-righteous pricks to be so venomous and hateful. It's one thing to have an opinion, but another to just be a jerk for no good reason. So, anyway... I liked it.",False
23,10,"Man knows little about the universe, understanding what and even who are responsible for what we are seeing is the new frontier!",mrcsystems,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are many unknowns in the universe, with the arrogance and ignorance of man possessing little knowledge of all that exists, yet believing he does.This movie is beautiful and a work of art while creating thought provocation, which brings many out of their comfort zone. Reality can scary with the unknown even scarier- which is what I see some of the incredibly insensitive and nasty reviews on ""lights in the sky"" being rooted in.We have it confirmed by the US pentagon and former Presidents, there are known flying spheres, lights, triangles and tic tac objects moving at will in our planets atmosphere and oceans- but don't know what or whom they are (or so they tell us 😳) so it's now time to drop our preconceived notions of what we think we know, and realize there is more which we don't know than we do. Welcome to the universe 😎 Enjoy Lights in The Sky... and look up...",False
24,10,Incredible videos. The most incredible evidence of ufos i have ever seen !,aylamariealbutt,n/a,15/08/2025,I was astonished at how this movie changed my entire perspective. Before watching this I didn't 1 bit believe in aliens or ufos but after watching this incredible documentary filmed by possibly one of the smartest women on planet earth I am not 100percent convinced in the existence of helicopters and low resolution video cameras. Bravo,False
25,8,Ignore the UNObombers and watch this.,casey-42712,n/a,15/08/2025,"First, the ""1"" reviews are just angry and mean.Krista brings a new way of looking at these whatever-they-ares without the overuse of tired and bad videos we've all seen a hundred times, and without excruciatingly bad sound playing the entire time.It's a different way to think about this, and just enjoy the work she's done.She's not hawking books, podcasts, seminars.No imperious ""you're not smart enough to understand without my help"" garbage. No alien toys and vapid space-brother books behind her. No matter of fact statements without corroboration, what a nice surprise I found this Doc to be.We need more like this, less Phil Mantle / Tictac / Secure Team 10 garbage ad nauseum.Very enjoyable!",False

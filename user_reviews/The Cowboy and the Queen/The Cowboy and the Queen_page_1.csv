1,10,How a Cowboy from California and the Queen of England made the world a better place for horses and for people.,moeliche,n/a,16/08/2025,"The way to put a saddle and bridle on a horse many years ago was called: ""Breaking a horse."" And that is exactly what happened. The result many times was a horse that was a danger to itself and to humans.All that started to change slowly but surely when Monty Roberts learned from observation of wild Mustangs in the Nevada dessert the language of the horse. When he tried to convince his father and others there was a better, faster, easier and non violent way to put a bridle and saddle on a horse he was met with scepticism and ridicule.One person from an unlikely place, the Queen of England, read about Monty's methods in two horse magazines. The Queen of England told one of her staff members to find, contact and invite Monty to Windsor Castle to see for herself if what Monty is doing is trickery or communication with horses. When the Queen was convinced that Monty has a profound understanding of horses and their language she knew what has to be done.The movie: The Cowboy and the Queen, tells us about the highlights of the journey to make the world a better place for horses and for people.Nowadays you hear more and more people in the world of horses speaking about: ""Starting a horse.""If there is one animal that needs an apology from us humans, it is the horse.Thanks to the late Queen Elizabeth II and Monty Roberts everyone can now communicate and understand horses if they love horses and are willing to learn.I will give this movie an A plus. It is in time, in tune and will speak to many hearts in time to come.",False
2,10,"Surprising, Uplifting, and Enjoyable",JimLovesMovies-1994,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a horse person nor am I necessarily a royalist. And this documentary completely blew me away. Monty is such a fascinating man. The film parallels his life with the Queen beautifully. What I thought was going to be a story about two friends, proved to be so much deeper. This is a subtle, feel good watch that builds to an emotional powerhouse of a film. Even better, Monty's non-violent philosophy provided some great lessons I feel will translate to me in my personal life. Important to note, there is some horse violence which at times was tough to watch. I was familiar with horse breaking - honestly, everyone is to an extent. But I had no idea how brutal it really was. Difficult to see but important in understanding what Monty and the Queen sought to change. Do yourself a favor and just watch it! I'm so happy I did.",False
3,10,"Uplifting to know, someone is promoting nonviolent training for horses",mwpjbshr,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a wonderful move movie to watch! Monty is a true disruptor of the horse training industry. Through his communication with Horses, Monty is able to gentle the horse so that a rider can be on them within 30 minutes. He even gentles a mustang in the wild. Unbelievable! Once the Queen found out, she thought the same thing- the world must know!This movie details, the parallel lives of Monty and the Queen from how they eventually met each other and to how they join forces to improve the horse industry.I hope the world continues to learn more about this so that violent training of horses ends. They are too beautiful and trusting to be treated so poorly, simply because people don't know a better way.",False
4,10,The Cowboy and the Queen: A Tale of Unlikely Friendship and Humane Revolution in Horse Training,wadekoch,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The Cowboy and the Queen"" is a heartfelt documentary that explores the remarkable bond between Monty Roberts, a renowned horse trainer in Solvang California, and Queen Elizabeth II. Directed by Andrea Nevins, the film delves into their 30-year friendship, united by their shared love for horses and dedication to humane training techniques. Monty Roberts, often called the ""Horse Whisperer,"" revolutionized horse training through his nonviolent ""Join-Up"" method, which caught the attention of the Queen in the late 1980s. Her admiration and support played a crucial role in helping Roberts gain global recognition.The documentary goes beyond merely chronicling their relationship; it also offers a rare glimpse into the Queen's personal side...one that is not often seen publicly. The film artfully juxtaposes Roberts' grounded, rural upbringing with the Queen's royal background, showcasing how their mutual respect transcended cultural and societal boundaries.What makes the documentary compelling is its focus on the transformative power of kindness and mutual understanding. Whether it's training horses or connecting with each other, Monty Roberts and the Queen shared a profound belief that empathy is far more effective than coercion. Their relationship is beautifully portrayed in the film, providing a testament to how two people from vastly different worlds can find common ground through shared passions.Having seen first hand these gentling and starting techniques at Robert's annual ""The Movement"" and volunteering at his Horse Sense & Healing courses at Flag is up Farm, I have witnessed the profound positive impact they have had on not only the horses, but the many veterans and first responders who attend. Best documentary I've seen in many years!",False
5,10,His life has been dedicated to challenging a tradition of violence,marty-51456,n/a,16/08/2025,"Monty Roberts is a rebel. A real cowboy who challenged the deep-seated traditions of how humans subvert the will of horses to make them useful beasts of burden. It is known as horse ""breaking,"" but Mr. Roberts eschews that term. Under his methods he prefers the term ""join-up.""It is no surprise that many in the horse industry have ridiculed, attacked, and slandered Monty Roberts during his life's journey to show the world that violence is not necessary in the process of gentling horses.His revolutionary techniques caught the attention of Queen Elizabeth II, and this film tells the story of how they became good friends and partners in the quest to change the horse industry. It is emotional, shocking at times, and inspirational. I saw the film at the Boulder Film Festival and I didn't see a dry eye in the packed theater at the closing credits.",False
6,10,"Absolutely incredible, powerful and deeply moving!",sophie-10744,n/a,16/08/2025,"Monty Roberts is a legend of all legends. He's changing the world with kindness and compassion one horse and human at a time. Such a beautiful and moving film! I hope Monty knows how much he is loved and appreciated. Thank you for all you do!I hope this film is shared widely and that it's the end of the violence against horses that has been going on for too long, it's heartbreaking!I have loved horses all my life and bought Monty's book and read it as a child. So grateful for everyone who brought this documentary to life so we can all understand Monty's mission, work and passion for horses.",False
7,10,The Cowboy and the Queen,nlitecaspianhorses,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this documentary for a number of reasons. Monty is a true gentleman and a real cowboy and I can see why the Queen picked him.I used ChatGPT to help write this review because I am disabled
The Cowboy and The Queen is an intriguing documentary that explores the unique relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and the American cowboy culture, notably focusing on her special bond with Monty Roberts, a well-known horse trainer. Directed by John Doe, the documentary offers an in-depth look at how two seemingly distant worlds-British royalty and rugged cowboy life-intersect through a shared passion for horses.One of the documentary's most compelling aspects is the way it delves into Queen Elizabeth's lifelong love for horses. As many royal enthusiasts know, the Queen had a deep personal connection to horses, and this documentary paints a vivid picture of how this passion shaped her relationships and interests. What stands out is the portrayal of how her love for horses extended beyond the palace walls and crossed cultural boundaries, bringing her in touch with people like Monty Roberts, who had a revolutionary approach to horse training.Roberts, known for his ""Join-Up"" method-a non-violent horse training technique-became a key figure in the Queen's life, not just as a trainer, but as a friend and confidant. The documentary does an excellent job of detailing how Roberts' methods, which emphasized understanding and cooperation with horses rather than breaking their will, resonated with Queen Elizabeth. This method mirrors her own approach to leadership and personal conduct, which emphasized quiet strength and compassion.What makes The Cowboy and The Queen particularly compelling is the way it contrasts two very different environments. On one side, we have the opulence and formality of the British monarchy, and on the other, the raw, untamed nature of American cowboy culture. The documentary makes the case that while these two worlds may seem poles apart, they share common values: hard work, resilience, and above all, a deep respect for horses. Queen Elizabeth is depicted not just as a royal figure, but as someone who, at her core, understood the discipline and dedication that come with horsemanship.The narrative is further enriched by archival footage of the Queen interacting with her horses, as well as interviews with Roberts, members of the royal household, and horse experts. These interviews provide valuable insights into the Queen's unique bond with her animals and how that relationship shaped her personal and public life. It's clear that horses were more than just a hobby for Queen Elizabeth-they were a source of solace, a way to escape the pressures of her royal duties, and a connection to the natural world.However, while the documentary excels in its portrayal of Queen Elizabeth's love for horses and her relationship with Monty Roberts, it sometimes feels a bit one-sided. The film tends to romanticize the connection between the two without critically examining some of the more challenging aspects of their relationship. For instance, the documentary could have delved deeper into the criticisms that Roberts' methods have faced within certain equestrian circles. While the ""Join-Up"" technique is widely praised, it has also sparked debate about whether it truly respects the natural behavior of horses.Moreover, the film could have explored more of the Queen's broader impact on the equestrian world. While her relationship with Roberts is fascinating, Queen Elizabeth's influence on horse breeding, racing, and conservation efforts is just as significant, if not more so. By focusing almost exclusively on Roberts, the documentary misses an opportunity to provide a more comprehensive view of the Queen's contributions to the horse world.Despite these shortcomings, The Cowboy and The Queen is a touching and engaging documentary that offers viewers a unique glimpse into the life of one of the most famous monarchs in history. It humanizes Queen Elizabeth in a way that few other documentaries have, showing her not just as a ruler but as a woman who found joy and meaning in her relationship with horses. For horse lovers and royal enthusiasts alike, this film is a must-watch, offering a new perspective on the Queen's life and legacy.In conclusion, The Cowboy and The Queen effectively captures the essence of a rare and fascinating relationship between two people from entirely different worlds, brought together by their mutual love and respect for horses. While it could have been more critical and comprehensive in some areas, it remains a beautifully crafted and heartfelt tribute to Queen Elizabeth's enduring passion for horses and the profound influence Monty Roberts had on her life.",False
8,10,Awesome Uplifting Touching Documentary,tybentoncox,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Cowboy and The Queen is an awesome, uplifting, emotionally touching film. I am a hug fan of Horseman Monty Roberts. When I heard about this film being made I knew I had to see it. It is a look a wonderful beautiful friendship spanning many years. The life of Queen Elisabeth and Monty Roberts are told and intertwined and very well edited together. Monty and Queen Elisabeth the 2nd are true inspirations for all of mankind not only how to treat horses but how we should treat each other as well. I absolutely loved this film. I was very deeply touched by it. I highly recommend this film to others. If you are a follower of Monty Roberts and his methods you should see this film.",False
9,10,Heartwarming,hwwnpvwxp,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautiful film, sharing Monty's story and the influence the queen has had on his journey and he on hers.Growing up with horses, the movie shares insights into the critics of Monty's work and how he overcame them.Travel through time as the film maps the world events that shaped both their lives in the UK and California.A story of following your heart, and always doing the right thing.An insight into the ways he works with horses and training methods.In recent years the methods have also shown to be successful at helping adults overcome post traumatic stress.An uplifting film for all to watch.",False
10,10,Beautifuly Articulated Story of Exceptional Characters,dorenemlorenz,n/a,16/08/2025,"The editing, musical choices, lighting, cinematography - top marks. Having been to Flag is Up Farms and interviewed Monty Roberts myself - I know the Hollywood-esque set and the central casting wardrobe are just another day in the life of this exceptional property.The characters themselves are larger-than-life yet very relatable and down-to-earth - which is what makes this film so compelling. It never panders, never flinches - addresses the conflicts in a very mature and introspective manner. Very cowboy in that regard, and very much in the nature of the late Queen.I was happy to see that the human work was covered as well as the horse work, it is hard to determine which will be Monty's strongest legacy.I recall learning against the rails of the track on the farm watching a throughbred making training runs, Monty tipping back his hat and saying, ""I am a horse trainer. I have no idea why they think I can do anything to help these people who obviously need significant help.""A year later, on my return visit we were standing in the same space. Monty, kicked his boot against the dirt twice, looked me straight in the eye and said, ""I figured it out. The first responders are here to help me.""",False
11,10,Beautiful and nauseating,Anonymous-242,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe I missed it, but this documentary needs a ""graphic"" warning. By my recollection, about 60% of this documentary is graphic recounting/depictions of what amounts to horse (and child) abuse/torture (NOT the work done by Monty, obvs). I guess I've lived a sheltered life, I knew about the mistreatment involved with soring, racing, and transport, but I did not appreciate the full depths of human depravity toward horses until I watched this. This is NOT for children. I'm middle aged and I'm still nauseous more than 24 hours after watching this. A rodeo is not something I would ever have attended anyway, but thanks for confirming my beliefs as to the horror of what really goes on (at least in the states where tripping is still legal-CO, WY, and UT looking at you-though the treatment of the steers and other animals is horrific and it's not just the horses). And I'm sorry, Monty, but your father was a psychopath. Yes, abusers were often abused, but people have a choice (as you yourself prove). You can't be an apologist for abuse. Otherwise, this is a lovely documentary and I wish there were more like it.",False

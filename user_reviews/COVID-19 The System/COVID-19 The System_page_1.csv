1,6,A personal take on Covid,Snorreplop,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched the Dutch documentary COVID-19 The system (available for free until December 19th via docsfair.nl).Main protagonist of this documentary is Nico Sloot, international businessman extraordinaire. He put thousands of hours in researching the current pandemic. He also has a boat and goes hiking, sometimes he stares thoughtfully in the distance.It's refreshing to hear another sound other than the cookiecutter blabber of politicians. I must admit there are interesting points made. In order of appearance: the T-cell argument, the dubious role of big pharma/big tech/(inter)national politics, the absence of critical and independent press and the legacy of an outdated monetary system to name a few.To my personal taste, Nico has a bit too much screen time and paints a too subjective picture to make this a great documentary. As an introduction to geopolitics and power machinations, it certainly is interesting material.English captioning available",False
2,1,Using Covid denier momentum for PR,m0v13l0v3r,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat better way to make money these days then with denying everything and playing facebook doctor. This movie is one of the reasons Lockdowns even take place. They are only there to fuel the mistrust even more while claiming to be ""independent"". They make money of this wanna-be-scientific non-sense and people who otherwise would buy crystals love this movie because it gives them a reason to not be safe and just deny reality. I was amazed he didn't mention 5G, Chemtrails, FlatEarth or Lizard people but they propably didn't want to be an easy target.The concept is pretty smart. Put it on youtube for free for 2 weeks and then charge people for it.Very One sided ""Documentary""Not one person with a mask in this movie.States fault that there is not enough place in hospitals, so lets just open everything up.Protagonist doesn't understand how vaccines work.Bill Gates of course.CoVid19 is just like Influenza.Pharma bad.Protagonist almost dies from heart infact, pharma good enough to save him there.Hypnotizing music in the background at all times to increase fear.Protagonist seem jealous that he is ""not"" making money now.Why not make a movie then.Lets add anti capitalism, while asking money for this ""documentary"".Poor people will pay/donate money to this scammer.Anti-Tech, but uses tech and social media themselfs.Throws in BLM for no reason at all.Asking for civil war.Shows HK protest in context of italians not getting money.Against polarisation, but itself pushes polarisation.Is for independence, uses youtube and facebook to distribute itself.Back to normal and 5% will die, no problem.500k dutch people can die... 2x more then WW2.",True
3,1,On youtube you would be booted off.,FilmMcCool,n/a,16/08/2025,"People on social media platforms are at the least being given warnings and at the most having their accounts cancelled for touting unproven information like this. While I am not a fan of censorship the CoronaVirus is just too dangerous for unproven information to be allowed masquerade as fact. I have noticed since the beginning of the Covid outbreak when you had the likes of David Icke claiming all sorts even that 5G was the cause, lately he has gone very quiet as the virus mutates and the infectiousness of the virus gets worse. This Pandemic is to deadly for a lot of people to allow either misinformed or self serving people to spread fake facts about the Pandemic. Our information must come from the scientists and medical people working at the coal face, some even loosing their lives in an effort to keep the rest of us safe. Please do not waste you time with this kind of stuff but if you must watch it please do not spread the so called misinformation they call facts, do some research first.",False
4,10,"Professional, insightful, high quality documentary",elien2001,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am blown away by the fact that this documentary has been produced in such a short time span. Hopefully it will reach many people, because during these current times it is more important than ever to be well informed.This documentary is based on scientific evidence and other facts. Thousands of hours of research have gone into it. Some very interesting scientists, doctors and other experts will provide you ""must-know"" information about COVID-19 and some relating subjects like the pharmaceutical industry and our money system. It's a funny coincidence that it shows the corruption in the medical area and that a few days after its premiere other people (from Follow The Money) published that the leading Dutch virologist Ab Osterhaus received 5,6 million as a shareholder of a vaccin company.Regarding our current division between people in the world, I would say this is an excellent movie for both ""sides"" to watch. Hopefully it will lead to many interesting conversations between family and friends.+Likes: very factual; pleasant and entertaining to watch; beautiful images; interesting topics.-Dislikes: it starts with an opinion. This could fool people into thinking that the movie is about opinions or is subjective, where really it's very objective.",False
5,3,"Nico ask some good questions, but his conclusions are questionable",brietman,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't recommond this documentary.Nico ask some good questions, but is framing his answers. He only want to hear wat he wants to hear. Thereby making a lot of assumptions and some weird hasty tinhat conclusions.You can see a lot nice footage of Nico on a set and on a boat. But you don't see much evidence for his assumptions. Or a nuanched view of the reality. Just eutonemes.The piece of the documentary with Evelien Peeters I appreciate. She gave corona some perspective.But also a lot fake facts:
Arguing that al viruses mutate
Telling Sweden is doing well
Making it a crime that the industrie wants too make money with vaccins
Telling that media aren't criticalI gave it a 3 for nice film-work and some critical questions. Too bad, I really like a good critical documentary. Not a tendious one, like this....",True

1,10,Must watch - what's behind food industry,martina_cn,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary shows the rotten system behind the industry of meat and food derived from animals. Like everything in this capitalistic world, it is ruled by people in power who work for their own interests. We need to thank Giulia Innocenzi and Pablo d'Ambrosi who were brave enough to tell this story and showed us the pure facts of this horrible system that exploits animals, creates food that is highly unhealthy on the long term and it creates pollution. It is very frustrating to watch politicians in the European parliament who are okay with a 6 legs pig and don't find it weird. The movie raises a great awareness in the mind of the most skepticals and it definitely pushes to take action against this horrible industry.",False
2,10,What they don't want you to know...,stigozzy-46081,n/a,17/08/2025,An incredible piece of daring filmmaking that ought to be shared widely across cinemas and streaming platforms to expose the corruption within our global food system and the exploitation of both humans and animals.The documentary is well-researched and provides shocking statistics and evidence of the horrors created by animal agriculture. These sit well alongside more anecdotal moments - the intimidation experienced by the filmmakers as their car is chased by farmers threatening them for exposing the horrific treatment of animals on their farms; the shocking backhanders accepted by EU parliamentarians from lobbyists to overturn policy challenges and the health hell-scape that the commoditisation of animals globally has created for the future of the human race is undeniable.EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW HOW THEIR TAXES ARE SPENT!,False

1,7,NECESSARY TO WATCH,urkus,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great documentation of recordings that were in old discs, and for this time they bring to digital quality to preserve it.They bring live to the Nurenberg judgements. They do a necessary job, a real good work, maybe too short, it should be done in chapters, cause the trials were very long. But nevertheless, here we have the voice and the footage of the real things that happened those days. We see and hear the voice of the perpetrators of the most horrific murdes that happened in the western culture.Very important to watch it cause that was what actually happened, and not to repeat it. That´s why we need to see it again and again till we understand that humanity can repeat it any time. Don´t forget it!Thanks for bringging the footage in black and white and not in colour, cause the colour makes Nazis appear more important an black and white is the way we should see it7 stars out of 10.",False
2,2,Just so so,rolfhu,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary started as expected and interesting. But to the end it had some comments that were actually missing.Did you know that the ICJ was created after the 2. WW to bring war criminals to justice? Not a word on that at the end.No word about, that the CIA took actually hundreds of Nazis to the US to work for the US government?The NASA was led by a ""Nazi"" Werner von Braun. He created actually the Vx rockets that hit England.The ICC was created in 2002 to also prosecute the head of states for war crimes directly. BUT no American or British war criminal was taken to the court. Because the US don't recognize the ICC as legit. And they were Presidents of the US and Britain.",False

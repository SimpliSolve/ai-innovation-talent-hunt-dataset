1,7,It's a decent follow up series.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"After the success of Worst roommate ever, it was pretty obvious that more would follow, Worst ex was the logical choice.It could have been a really cheap and vacuous follow up series, but it's good, definitely well worth watching. If you're into real life crime documentaries, then I think you'll enjoy this one.This first series is made up of four episodes, four fairly different, but equally interesting and shocking storylines, but it was Killing for custody that shocked me most of all, talk about a harrowing watch.It's nicely made, with interesting, first hand interviews, and the obvious 'Worst' accompanying animations.One thing that seems apparent throughout, failings by the authorities, it seems in most of the stories, victims are let down by the powers that be, especially Seemona.I wonder what's next, worst barista ever, worst dog walker ever? I'd be down for that. You know what happens when these guys get a formula that works.7/10.",False
2,8,DV should be taken more seriously,Claire-62352,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDuring the first episode i kept thinking and thinking, how and why isn't the law protecting these women. I mean the second girl was afraid to talk to the police because they already failed her once. This is so common for the victims of DV, they're afraid that neither the police or anyone will protect them and that they will end up dead from their abuser. So many women have ended up killed by this kind of men and it's shocking and so disappointing. I really kept wondering how many women have to get beaten,how bad, who has to die for that man to end up in prison for life?!? Apparently someone has to die before the law starts blinking an eye on these cases, and two people did. So shockingly disappointing and so admirable that those women found the strength to go on with their lives.",True
3,6,Shocking first episode,abdul-alkhaldi1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe story of the first episode is shocking to say the least. Not because of the violence or how the culprit (Ben) went on about hurting people as he pleases, but because of the shear stupidity and lack of competency that the police showed. OMFGGGGGGG, how can they be this stupid? They had the criminal within reach at Tina's cabin, and they let him go on to kill 2 more people! These kind of shows explains how the police is doing more damage to the American society than people realize. I think the moral of the story is that American police are TRASH, and every cent that the taxpayers spend on this failed institution is WASTED..",True
4,7,First Episode,jasondamore,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis review is for the first episode only. It was well done however I'm not really surprised on how the blame was put on the police department. Yes the police made a huge mistake arresting the first girlfriend, but they're not the reason two people were killed. That lies with Ben obviously but also Jamie, the second girlfriend. I was kind of appalled that she didn't feel any remorse for not testifying in court. While I totally understand the fear she must have had for what he did to her. But her decision not to testify for fear of being in a courtroom with him is exactly what led to him being out on the street again. If Jaime would've testified then Justine isn't assaulted and those two men in Oregon are alive today.",True
5,8,It's absolutely crazy how crazy some people are.,VeggieVader,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWorst Ex Ever was an interesting and well done series. It's absolutely crazy how crazy some people are and the lengths they will go to to frame or torture their victims. It's also crazy how stupid some of the victims are. For example, in the first episode, the first girlfriend of Ben. She is so extremely abused by him that she almost dies, but still she goes back to him?! How can you do that? Why? I really don't understand. I understand some victims in some situations, that they don't leave because of fear, but this was so extreme. Very tragic. The police must also take these situations more seriously.I'm glad the victim in the second episode was successful in suing the police for $2 million. Just like she said, it's not about the money. It's about the principle, to show how mistreated she was. It's people's lives we are talking about here!This was a really good show. I'm gonna watch Worst Roommate Ever next, as I haven't seen that.",True
6,7,Well constructed series but the victims are none too bright,msghall,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is well put together series, expertly edited with a strong narrative to each episode. It's easy to binge these shows not just because they are so concisely edited and filmed but the stories are compelling.However, it should be noted that the victims, their families and friends, demonstrate a naivete that borders on stupidity. Each victim, and most of their friends and families had all the clues about their perpetrators behavior but look the other way. In a country where millions voted for a president who is abusive and a criminal, it comes at no surprise that these victims have been so easily manipulated.Anybody with early insight into the true nature of these abusers are dismissed. It's not just a story of people being misled and abused but of a country too often allowing themselves to be misled and abused.",False
7,9,Harrowing at times but absolutely worth a watch,roisinweymes,n/a,16/08/2025,"All the episodes are very interesting and worth a watch, but I found the 3rd and 4th ones particularly sad and horrific. I was so impressed with the protagonist/narrator from the last one in getting an amendment to a bill passed after what she experienced - what an amazing thing to do after what she went through. That will help so many people. Well done. So sad for what all these victims went through, it's so shocking to see what can happen to the human psyche to make people do such insane things. And so awful to see how the victims try to get away but they can't because procedure needs to be followed, and while it is, sometimes much worse things happen that could have been avoided.Great series. Looking forward to whatever they do next!",False
8,6,Sad and disturbing,sja-awesome,n/a,16/08/2025,"The cycle of abuse and victimhood never changes. It goes from sick disturbed person to disturb person and if people who have abuse in their lives have children they pass on the illness to them just like any hereditary disease. Either you become the monster or you become a victim to someone else. Sick ill people attract sick and ill people. People with healthy emotions, personal boundaries, grounded morals and values do not let sickos into their lives and sickos are not attracted to them because having a healthy mentality and emotions is like a force field against these kind of people. If you've grown up with an abusive or controlling or psychopathic caregiver it is part of your everyday life and you will not see signals and red flags from other disturbed people or other victims. If you ever find yourself in a situation from a man like this, He does not love you He does not care about you He is completely utterly using you and you have any shred of self-esteem and self-worth left reach out to every person possible for support, find government programs, involve yourself with the police and get yourself away.. your life may depend on it. It's also disgusting how the Justice system fails these people. Cops who don't want to listen or do their job. Victims who fear for their life and don't want to expose themselves further to the psychopath and then the law is just like oh well.. Let him go. So he can murder, torture and dismember more women. Please officers need to have a mandated psychology course and a firm understanding of behavior and abuse.",False
9,10,Emotional to see the camaraderie between women,ravenclaw_girlrules,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was very moved by the first episode of this show. Ben was a deeply evil person and I'm upset that he evaded accountability and justice in the end, but at least he's no longer terrorizing women. I thought this show was going to be more lighthearted stories, not 'beatings, strangulation, manhunt, and suicide.'I started crying when Justine came onscreen and they revealed she was alive. I'm so happy for the friend that found her as well. I have never seen someone speak so highly of their friend - truly a ride or die there. I think it's understated how brave she is. She was going to get into that house at all costs. She did not really seem to think about her own personal safety and she did not wait for first responders to try to gain entrance to the house. Give her a prize.Personally, I wasn't aware of this story so it was news to me. It is different to hear the story from the victim's mouth versus reading it on the news.",True
10,6,"Fairly good, but too long",inc-133-70013,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a finely made documentary series, with quite eerie and disturbing topic.There's just one problem with it, and it's how producers of this documentary reasoned; if you have 30 minutes worth of a story, and you have a contract for a one hour episode, then by any sanity, you should just tell TWO of such stories to fill the time.What did producers do? Create 30 minutes of cartoons to simply waste viewer's time.Now, if the 30-minute story is not very good, and it's 30 minutes long, typical person would go, ""meh, it was just 30 minutes, anyway"". But if it's dragged out to a hour, not only did the person watch a poor story, but they also lost entire hour of their lifetime for no good reason.So, while it's a fine documentary, everything's dragged out about twice the length it should be. Which is just utterly annoying.I do not know why people who work for Netflix do this. One would assume that if you get a contract from major streaming platform, you'd try your best to be sane and reasonable and deliver a top product.Guess I don't know something.",False
11,8,Good,fredspoon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ignore the bad reviews. This programme is good and highlighting the absolute horrendous problem of domestic violence and those people who think that women are just a commodity to be used.Yes, some of the scenes are dramatised for the programme this helps tell the stories of those victims who have survived such terrible ordeals.There should be more conversation about how men treat women and how some law enforcement agencies will side with the perpetrator rather than the victim.Other comments have politicised this sort of show, which is not acceptable. Domestic violence is a warrant and should be called out regardless.",False
12,4,Here we don't ask why...,edwin-wks,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Worse Ever series are fine if you just wish to wither a couple of hours away without using your brain cells or have it in the background while you do something else. Don't expect any earth-shattering insights or nuggets of wisdom because this is true crime lite. There is nothing more to glean in these episodes than if we were to simply read about the events as reported in the news.Some of these events are so recent, like episode 1, that it makes it impossible to invite further comment and investigation by forensic experts and psychiatrists without risking a lawsuit as there are still living members in the immediate family of the perpetrators, who may object to being cast in an unflattering light. But it is really true crime if the motivations and machinations of unhinged people like Benjamin Foster are not explored at all?How did Ben turn out the way he did? What was his childhood like? How was his relationship with his parents? What did his brother have to say about their experiences growing up together? Why didn't his parents seem more upset when spoken to about him being on the run? Could they have done more to intervene after his initial brush with the law or did they not care enough to? What skeleton in the closet is his family hiding? When he misdirected his rage and sadism at the women, who in his mind was he really lashing out at? All of these questions and not a single answer.There is also a curious absence of reflection from those affected by these malevolent characters. What lessons did they learn from their experience and how has their ex affected the way they view the world or interact with others? What advice or recommendations do they have for anyone who should find themselves in the same unfortunate predicament of facing a toxic partner?",False
13,8,Holy crap!,CatRufus5591,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerRemember 'Play Misty For Me' starring Clint Eastwood? I would take Evelyn (Jessica Walter) any day over some of the psychos on this show. I've watched three of the four episodes so far, and one psycho is worse than the next!One thing the shows share in common: sociopaths who should have been stopped before they victimized one person after another. But for one reason or other, crazy people find a way to fly under the radar while they terrorize anyone who takes them in.One particular episode featured a woman who had been held hostage and savagely beaten by her psycho boyfriend. After his arrest, she REFUSED to testify against him in court. Infuriating!!! He was set free and went on to beat two men to death, and pummel and nearly kill another girlfriend. If only the ex-girlfriend had testified in court, he might have been stopped before he claimed more victims.If nothing else, this series will help you realize the importance of background checks!",True
14,8,Entertaining but frustrating,rgrogers-89877,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this program will make you want to scream at your television. Not to sound too judgmental, but some of the women in these episodes are just far too trusting and just horrible judges of character. How many times do you need to get abused or beaten before you realize a guy is bad news?The first episode in particular also shines a terrible spotlight on law enforcement in Nevada and Oregon. The utter incompetence is just enraging. The fact that Ben Foster was able to threaten and abuse women over and over again is a disgraceful failure by the legal system. And watching the almost slapstick antics of the cops in Oregon trying to apprehend Foster was just theater of the absurd.",False
15,8,"Scary, better than Roommate series.",cb_whitewood,n/a,16/08/2025,"As far as thrills and adrenaline rushes go, I think that Worst Ex Ever was much more effective than Worst Roommate Ever. These stories were horrifying because of both the ongoing DV, but also at how pathetic the police has been through time. It should NOT have to get the point of assault happening for these people to get some level of protection against their former partners!!! ""Killing for Custody"" was right out of a horror movie, but I was grateful for such a striking example of men being victims of DV as well. It's necessary representation, and I hope that others who watch this show leave with a better understanding of DV, DV warning signs, and the lasting impact these experiences have on survivors.",False
16,5,"Episode 1 is strong, the rest not so much",eauzone,n/a,16/08/2025,"The horror of being close to a truly bad person must be just nightmarish. Episode 1 conveys this sense very strongly and by the end of the episode, an emotionally exhausting narrative has been laid out.However, the rest of the series falls far short of the series opener. Not that those other stories aren't stunning, but they're simply poorly constructed and drag on in ways that seem more focused on squeezing every detail, however unnecessary, out of the interviews.With no intention to diminish those stories, it must be said that they're poorly presented and simply are not compelling. At a time when criminal reality shows abound on streaming platforms, there's much better content out there.",False
17,5,First two are good,alatlantic,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first episode is fantastic. That could even be a movie by itself. The second episode is pretty good too. It's extremely frustrating at times but man, what a masterpiece of psychopathy.From there I was hooked, but then slammed to reality. The third episode is an extremely lonely introvert who makes bad decisions. It's not a bad episode necessarily, but not that interesting and ultimately kind of aggravating to watch.By the fourth episode, you kind of feel they all just deserve each other. I don't want to sound cold hearted, but in the context of the show, they just aren't as interesting nor out of nowhere.I'd probably watch the first two, skip the rest.",False
18,3,They made it boring,opotraining,n/a,16/08/2025,Watched first episode and it was kinda boring. The narration was very slow and kind of lazy although the story was interesting. The narration should be better. They show animation for few seconds and immediately the person who is narrating it. They should either show more animation or don't show at all.Watched first episode and it was kinda boring. The narration was very slow and kind of lazy although the story was interesting.

19,1,DV Porn,info-50283,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all, this series portrays physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, coercive control, murder, etc. Where were the trigger warnings? And what was the purpose of this series other than for entertainment value? It brought together all those affected, the spouses and their families, got them to talk about the events in great detail, yet somehow neglected to even ask them what they learnt from these ""worst ex ever""s and how their experience has changed their perspectives. It takes four episodes for someone to even describe coercive control. The other people like the police and DAs don't discuss domestic violence or what people should do if they ever find their prince or princess turning into a toxic toad. So the series is basically DV porn with little educational value.And I just have to add how people who rate this voyeuristic garbage highly seem to have experienced domestic violence themselves, and somehow find solace and validation in watching the depiction of others' misfortunes. They also tend to conveniently ignore that men can suffer from domestic violence too (see episode 3) and this tends to be underreported because they don't appear as credible as battered women. Bad parenting produces both tormented sons and daughters, who then bring their distorted perceptions into their relationships. If you find yourself in multiple failed or abusive relationships, perhaps you might be contributing to it. Seek help.",False
20,1,Bit overwhelmed!,maclam-54308,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm sorry if I've been too judgy but when I started watching the first episode she clearly say' I'm kind of person I push people's button' mate someone has going tru something we need to stop and help dem by controlling ur emoting isn't it?

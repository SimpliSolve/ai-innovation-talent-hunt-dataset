1,1,Terrible and overdramatic,zathan-32848,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is made to be very dramatic. Its not very entertaining and does not give you the facts in a good way. extensive cutting in clips and showing them over and over agian. quite stressful to watch. Not in a scary way, just very annoying",False
2,3,Meh,xombie76,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat's disappointing about the ""end of days"" is that it only seems to affect the USA...",True
3,2,Ridiculous Series!,collectorofsorts,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat do you get when you have a rambling figure who speaks in unclear riddles that have to be ""interpreted""? A 500 year old tale of a conman. Everything Nostradamus wrote is in riddles. It's easy to look back after something happens and say, 'hey, maybe this is what he was talking about'. But, no. Maybe an ""old lion kills a young lion"" was just talking about nature and not about kings as the 'interpreters' claim. The point is that, if you write enough rambling junk, people can always look back and say 'hey, maybe he meant.....'. Silly program. I was expecting some entertainment. Didn't even get that. All I got was science fiction and scare tactics. NOT recommended!",True
4,1,Nostradamus: a waste of time and narrators who contradict each other!,cdeanroane,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have to agree with the first reviewer that most of what Nostradamus wrote can be applied to events after they happen but you cannot predict a coming event from Nostradamus writing. Since he wrote in riddles one can go mad trying to react to his writings. In one episode one narrator said Washington DC would be destroyed when a nuclear reactor outside of DC has a meltdown like Chernobyl. The next narrator said DC would be ended by a nuclear missal. It is also funny as many keep making the excuse that Nostradamus could not accurately describe somethings as they did not exist in his time, then turn right around say that Nostradamus saw it all like a movie in his head. Well he should have been able to describe with clear detail what he saw even if the object did not exist in his time. This show has some of the same narrators you will see in other conspires theory shows!",True
5,1,GET RID OF THE IDIOTS THAT TALK ON THE SHOW!!,firballblaze-69689,n/a,16/08/2025,"They're a bunch of yahoos and they sound so stupid! I'll make a prediction of my own; If you don't get rid of them and get a better narrator like Morgan Freeman or James Earl Jones and lose the annoying cast, this show will be cancelled in the very, very near future.
I really Hope the weak minded don't watch this.
Read the actual history books. Read the holy bible also.
Make your own opinion.
Oh also, Nostradamus NEVER< NOT ONCE<< EVER<<CLAIMED TO BE
a PROPHET, EVER!! He actually mentions that he is NOT a prophet several times throughout his writings!!",False
6,3,Disappointing,evonneamag,n/a,16/08/2025,"I 'm a big Nostradamus fan but this has too much supposition, drama and repetition. Had the producers focused on his writings and the various academic interpretations, they would have garnered a larger audience. Not everyone agrees on how to decode the meaning of his writings. So why not include those so viewers can make up their own mind. Maybe include other clairvoyants and their predictions especially those of Edgar Cayce. Let's not forget why Nostradamus stayed under the radar which forced him to write in code. That precludes making public his special gift to those who would persecute him.",False
7,10,People Take This Too Seriously,xmattperkins-04180,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is meant for entertainment not to get future facts from (there is no such thing as future facts since the future hasn't happened yet). These people giving low ratings are prolly the same people who takes Tucker Carlson seriously, that believe the QAnon conspiracy theory and who kept believing the election would be overturned. Why do I say this? Because normal people see things like this as entertainment only, those living in an alternative reality take these predictions seriously.",False
8,2,"Disappointing. Sensationalistic, not very intelligent",alawyn-50195,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was looking forward to this, especially since they're factoring in stuff from the recently discovered ""Lost Book of Nostradamus"" (there's only been one show on that a few years ago, which didn't go over many of the drawings). But this series is scientifically sloppy and ignorant, making absurd statements - such as one volcanic eruption being able to trigger a whole series of other volcanoes along the ring of fire (no, every volcano is totally individualistic), or that a Kilauea eruption would effect California (oh please, Kilauea eruptions barely effect the city of Hilo on the same island; also Kilauea magma is runny not highly explosive). This series is full of breath-taking poorly reasoned claims and seems more interested in being sensational than being intelligent. I also don't like the Nostradamus experts they have, except for Victor Baines. They're too much from the woo-woo brigade. This is disappointing because I know there are intelligent Nostradamus researchers out there who can explain how they arrive at their conclusions instead of just making grand declarations. For instance, why they think that ""New City"" is generally considered to refer to the US (what? I thought everyone considered that to be New York City - but no context or reasoning is given). They all think they know *just* what Nostradamus was thinking, and almost never give us reasoning how they got there. I'm still watching this for the very few of Nostradamus' quatrains and very few drawings from the ""Lost Book of Nostradamus"" they do refer to. But I have to put up with a lot of sensationalistic crap to get at these few interesting scraps.",False
9,1,Seriously?,asharmbers,n/a,16/08/2025,"Where do I start? Nostradamus writings were so poorly translated in these programs.Nostradamus is French, in France, making predictions from France 500 years ago, in his world, from his perspective, ( and he didn't even know the United States existed ) But these programs make out that almost every single thing he predicted happens somewhere in the United States.For example, the place of theatres, if you are to look from nostradamus perspective, that would be Greece or Rome, not Hollywood. This program in incredibly frustrating to watch.",False
10,1,Episode 2 inaccuracy,tarobinson-97125,n/a,16/08/2025,"My husband was watching episode 2 & as I walked through the room them say ""it's a beautiful morning here in St. Louis"". However, when I looked at the screen I saw a shot of the North Market, which is actually located in downtown Columbus, Ohio & has been since 1876. If you misrepresent something like that, it makes me question the accuracy of everything in the program.",False
11,1,Flashy show without facts,izak-19906,n/a,16/08/2025,"Extensive cutting, very tiresome to watch. Terrible. Showing the same clips over and over again. Stopped watching after the first episode. If you want to have seizures, start bingewatching season one.",False
12,2,Complete fiction,africe,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was tolerating watching this show until episide 2. I'm a fan of Nostradamus but his prophecies can be manipulated to match certain events. My problem with this episode is the section about Russia's Poseidon missile system attacking New York. Granted it would destroy the city but do these idiots believe the United States is not prepared for an attack like this???? If Russia were to attack, our nuclear missile systems would obliterate Moscow and most all of Russia. A Russian nuclear attack would cause the end the entire world! C'MON MAN!!!!But what really gets me is they have 2 psychic mediums commenting on his predictions (Chip Coffey and Michelle Belanger). Uh, shouldn't they be able to ""see"" this? Not sure if I can watch any more of this series.",False
13,2,No Facts Just Fiction,digger01,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is so hard to watch, basic story follows a man from 500 years ago that wrote down some riddles, sure there may be the coincidental happenings in the real world, but there is nothing to suggest that Nostradamus wrote of these events.He wasn't a prophet. He says so himself, so why watch these doom and gloom wanna-be presenters that claim they know what these quatrains meant?Nostradamus was clearly very well educated and there is that outside chance that he was a prophet, but there is nothing in his quatrains that suggests anything near what this show is claiming.",False
14,1,Viewer BEWARE!,itsabacus2009,n/a,16/08/2025,"90% of the time they MISQUOTE Nostradamus OR will leave out IMPORTANT details ON PURPOSE to spin their narrative! The rest of the time, they will take other Quatrains that DON'T belong together, and TRY to tie them together to further fuel their FALSE point! This whole series is MISLEADING and downright INSULTING! For example, they'll say that a event will happen in DC, HOWEVER they WON'T disclose how they came to this conclusion or they will guess about something without ANY evidence to back it up and just simply RUN WITH IT! Quite frankly, I wish I could give them 0 stars! Because that's what I feel they're worth!",False
15,10,Brilliant Series !!!,rocktronross,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are a fan of Nostradamus you will love this series.. The Apocalyptic Imagery is amazing and I love how actual dates are put to the Prophecies of Nostradamus... I hope we get many more Episodes of this great series, I want to know more about ' The Third AntiChrist '... Nostradamus has proven himself as the greatest seer of all time and I love how his visions match with the Book Of Revelations in The Bible. I can not understand how and why anyone would leave a negative review for this great series !!!",False
16,1,And each episode the whole world perishes,mbravakis,n/a,16/08/2025,So which episode is the correct end of humanity? I find it hilarious about The Hunger due to Locust. We deal with Locust every 17 years. Have yet to see major problems yet somehow when the comment runs we will all die from Hunger due to the locusts. However in the episode previous to this this series predicted the comet was smash into the Earth and we would all die so which one is it?,False
17,1,Rubbish,khaliisaar,n/a,16/08/2025,What an absolute rubbish speculative drama. There isn't anything vaguely sensible about what these clowns are discussing. Just pure rubbish. Don't waste your time on this series. Do some reading instead.,False
18,1,For you naysayers..regarding Prophets!,levans_tolle,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, as a Prophet myself, his ""Riddles"" as someone called it, it's because we SEE what we HEAR. We don't see in FULL but we HEAR in Full. Our descriptions are an art to piece together with the words. For instance, a murder case I did, I seen and described what the woman was in as ""it's like a school hallway, shaped like a school hallway but not a school hallway, not even a building, just shaped like a school hallway"". Never knowing the persons name, only a picture of her, never knowing one piece of detail.. That hallway, shape like a hallway, ended up being a TRAILER Home.I detailed all pieces that took place of that murder without seeing half of it. It's called ""Spirit Ears and Eyes"".I've predicted Futures since a little girl but couldn't explain why I seen what I seen. So cut the Prophets some slack and Heed their Warnings.!.! We aren't gifted with being there in the moment, it's up to us to piece together what we HEAR of the short visions clips we SEE..
I have tons more to say but please don't judge those of us trying to help thru ""God's Gifts""..It's a horrible Sin to slam God's people..We are given this gift to HELP you with His ""TRUTH""!",False
19,3,Mostly Nonsense,julie-frasher,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lots of hooey and poorly researched information. And, for the love of all that is holy...we might be a fly over state, but it's pronounced MAD-rid, not ma-DRID. It's Missouri - not Spain.",False

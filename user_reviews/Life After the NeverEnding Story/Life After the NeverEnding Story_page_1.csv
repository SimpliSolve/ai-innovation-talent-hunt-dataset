1,9,The Life After series continues...,bbdec-48327,n/a,15/08/2025,"Following on from Life After Flash (2017) & Life After The Navigator (2020) director Lisa Downs delivers another outstanding heartfelt and insightful documentary. The documentary covers the making of the 1984 film The NeverEnding story with interviews from key members of the cast and crew. What makes this series of documentaries more unique is that they cover the course that the main actors career's and life's take following the films subsequent release. Sometimes, the journey for child actor's as they grow older within the film industry can be devastating, but it is covered here in a emotional and sincere way.",False
2,10,Insightful and poignant,Mr_Ghostface_Lives,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just as with her previous two ""Life After"" films, director Lisa Downs takes a deep dive into the lives of those involved in the making of a classic '80s cult movie. In this case, she delves into the troubled life of Noah Hathaway and intercuts it with a look at the experiences of Tami Stronach, who as Hathway himself states, had a very different experience to her in the making of The NeverEnding Story. It's a light and dark story, interspersed with some insightful interviews with supporting actors and key crew members, and lots of never-seen-before archive photos and behind-the-scenes footage. For fans around my age who were lucky enough to see the original movie in our childhoods, Life After The NeverEnding Story also brings some closure, some release from that hankering for things I loved as a kid. It doesn't do it justice to call these documentaries, they're films, and this is the best one yet. I really loved it.",False
3,10,Life After.... Another nostalgic hit!,ScouseTrooper,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lisa Downs' latest documentary, ""Life After The NeverEnding Story,"" continues the remarkable trend set by her previous works, ""Life After Flash"" and ""Life After The Navigator.""This installment dives deep into the enchanting world behind the 1984 classic, ""The NeverEnding Story,"" offering viewers a treasure trove of detailed behind-the-scenes stories from the cast and its crew. These anecdotes provide fresh insights and a new appreciation for the film's creation and legacy far beyond anything you could imagine actually.The documentary masterfully evokes the same emotions as its predecessors, weaving nostalgia with poignant reflections on the movie's impact on both its audience and those who brought it to life, especially Mr Noah Hathaway.As with the other films in the series, ""Life After The NeverEnding Story"" doesn't just revisit the past; it explores the lasting influence of these beloved films, making this documentary another 10/10 hit in my eyes.Adding to the future excitement, their recent announcement of the next big 80s classic to receive the 'Life After' treatment- the 1985 cult hit ""The Goonies""- has me eagerly anticipating more nostalgic revelations. For numerous, completely unbiased reasons, I can't wait to see what Lisa Downs will uncover for us in this upcoming documentary. Hey You Guys!!!!",False
4,10,The human side of filmmaking exposed - a wonderful documentary!,martyndrake1976,n/a,15/08/2025,"After watching ""Life after Flash,"" which came with the 4K special release of ""Flash Gordon,"" I was intrigued to learn that Lisa Downs had been working on a new documentary, ""Life after the Navigator."" This documentary detailed the making of ""The Flight of the Navigator"" and its star, Joey Cromer. Like ""Life After Flash,"" it provided all the nerdy behind-the-scenes information I could want, but more importantly, it showed the very human side of making movies. Warts and all.Now, with ""Life after The Neverending Story,"" we get the truth about the making of the incredible ""The Neverending Story"" and its stars, who were treated well by production but were let down by the studio system. It was great to see Colin Arthur, whose work inspired me-along with Jim Henson's Creature Shop-to get into the business. Ultimately, I ended up working in VFX and the video games industry. The team that brought the movie to life told very human stories about the making of an incredible film.I am very much looking forward to the other ""Life After"" movies in the series. Lisa Downs and Ashley Pugh are the two people who can faithfully tell all about the making of a classic film-warts and all-and what it took to make it.",False

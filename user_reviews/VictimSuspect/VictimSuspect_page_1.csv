1,7,Yet another example of police Incompetence,rbrb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a heavily intense true account whereby a young reporter explains how the police can sometimes misuse their powers when investigating sex cases.A person makes an allegation of rape or sexual assault and instead of properly and fairly researching the case some police will incorrectly turn the tables and accuse the victim of making a false report and have that person prosecuted.Quite shocking how frequently this can happen.Also, what is disturbing is how the police are allowed to get away with lying to victims and persuading vulnerable people to admit they are the ones at fault when they are innocent.But then again I ask myself why are police allowed to pretend to be underage children and lie to adults to entice them into sting operations?Although this documentary could be made more exciting, the subject matter is well handled and worthy of a high rating. Six and a half rounded up:7/10.",False
2,7,How victims become suspects will infuriate you,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Victims/Suspects"" (2023 release; 90 min.) opens, we are introduced to Rachel De Leon of the Center for Investigative Reporting out in Oakland, CA. De Leon stumbles on a story out of Tuscaloosa, Alabama where a young girl gets sentenced to jail for false reporting (reporting a rape that police concludes didn't happen). Intrigued, De Elon starts digging deeper, and finds a bunch of such other false reporting cases... At this point we are 10 minutes into the film.Couple of comments: this is the second feature-length documentary from director Nancy Schwartzman (""Run Red Run""). Here she follows investigative reporter De Leon for several years, as De Leon digs deeper and deeper into these seemingly incomprehensible cases where victims become suspects. Watch cop after cop manipulate and ""ruse"" (i.e. Outright lie) these young women, to the point of arresting these young women who came forward to seek protection in the first place. It will infuriate you how this social injustice goes on all over the country. Some might say ""but why do these women admit to having fabricated these charges"", my answer is to WATCH THIS and you will understand why. This is of course not a new trend, and thousands of innocent people confess to something they never did, after lengthy manipulation by cops and prosecutors. Schwartzman lays it out very clearly from start to finish. Last but certainly not least, a big kudos to Rachel De Leon for her important investigative journalism in getting to the bottom of this.""Victim/Suspect"" briefly played in select US theaters, and then started streaming on Netflix, where I caught it this Memorial Day weekend. If you have any interest in social justice issues, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
3,8,No Surprise,SharDBear,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a multiple sexual assault victim, myself.I'm kind of glad I never came forth to report of my assaults, or even mention them to those I even trust, or should trust.I have heard too many stories of how victims have been shamed, or have made to feel/think we have deserved it some way (the way we were dressed, acted, mixed signals, etc).It's truly sad.More needs to be done.It's deplorable of what are justice system is. Even more deplorable of our ""serve and protect"" people are.My faith in humanity and society is pretty nonexistent, nor will I ever turn to those who I'm expected to trust (LE's) to expect to protect me. I think I will rely on myself to do that from now on.",False
4,6,"Uneven structure, but well-informed",peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSaw this at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival""Victim/Suspect"" is a documentary about young women who tell the police they've been sexually assaulted, but instead of finding justice, they're charged with the crime of making a false report, arrested, and even imprisoned by the system they believed would protect them. Throughout the perspective of journalists, the film examines them trying to seek justice for those who are given injustice. The entire film has interesting concepts and themes explored while being mostly standard.Director Nancy Schwartzman provides a good direction and the film's tone, style, and presentation of what the film is going for. The subjects of rape and injustice are tough to watch and she provides good commentary about how the system is broken and it needs to change. Security footage of confessions and interrogation of the victims with police are pretty upsetting and hard to watch alongside with interviews from the main participants themselves.Because the story is told from an Journalist's perspective, some of the pacing did drag a little and I wish the story was explored a little more from the participants rather than the Journalists because it creates an uneven structure of the documentary. At some points, the soundtrack was repetitive and style felt something you would see from Netflix.Overall, it's not the best documentary on this subject but it's still well-informed and interesting to observe. It can be tough for some but I do recommend for those who are into journalism or documentaries about injustice.Rating: B-",True
5,n/a,Informative but..,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"All this documentary did is reinforce,how broken the system remains.Have been a victim & worked with victims also men falsely accused therefore went into this,with an open & unbiased mind to see how the series unfolded so here's my take..Honestly all victims need to bring legal counsel with them,this only proves that immensely.What is further scary.. Will make attackers feel invincible,because police are so lazy doing a proper investigation.It begs the question do many get in law enforcement/official capacities for wrong reasons,basically protecting""boys will be boys""club or being able to bully but calling it interrogation & so forth? Not saying females in power positions are any better,some will be just as cruel if not worse.All that was missing,if you would of dressed different garbage.. Beyond sickening & typical gaslight excuses,done by those in charge of sex crimes.I feel worried for those who are future victims,that fail to come forward as a result of seeing this.Hoping law enforcement change their tactics,but feel that will never happen but instead cover things up more.. Tapes that interrogate victims,etc.Again.. Bring someone with that ""you"" trust & will advocate on your behalf,not just from a victims group especially if police recommended. -Some are shady & on the wrong side,of actually helping victims.Hope those in charge or having power,start making their communities safer.Some may ask..
If someone reports a crime,why eventually falter? Not what many perhaps think,where guilt of lying comes to surface.. Instead it's being worn down by a system,that should be fair & protect.Most cases the investigation into the victim is greater than a person accused,so any outcome isn't factual but biased & again.. Causes a victim,to be further harmed.A reviewer mentioned she was upset about not having,stories that included African Americans..
Perhaps it was because nobody of that ethnicity wanted to be documented on camera or was not just about representing sex crime victims,but more specifically certain law enforcement agencies handling of cases.Still.. Watch this including with your daughters to teach them,how to protect themselves not just from attackers but legally.",False
6,7,An answer to a question I've always had,atleverton,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary explains a social phenomenon that I have always wondered about. I've always been curious as to why when the topic of sexual assault is brought up, there are numerous people who say yes, but false allegations can ruin lives and this is much more of a problem than sexual assault is. In the United States at least, there is a disturbing yet simple explanation for this. This is the fact that police officers are under a lot of pressure to close investigations because an investigation which leads to a conviction is seen as a success for them. This coupled with the fact that sexual assault claims are very difficult to investigate makes it ironically much easier to frame the whole thing as a false allegation, and in many places false allegations are actually criminal offenses. The documentary does a good job of examining many situations in which the police seem to have just decided it was easier to charge the woman with a false allegation than actually investigate the claims. Another problem that the documentary mentions is the fact that police are under no obligation to tell the truth in an investigation, so sometimes they will straight up lie to a woman who is coming forward with a claim of sexual assault and because she is in a vulnerable position she will feel like yes they must be telling the truth, and then you have the same problem with false recantations as there is with false confessions. So the social phenomenon of people decrying false allegations as being a plague comes from this fact. And the fact that in addition to everything I just mentioned, often these cases are prominently featured in the media with headlines like 'woman falsely claims rape'. The problem, if it isn't obvious by now, is that the initial claims are often never actually investigated. If you are a detective, and you feel that someone is lying to you, I think you need to be under an obligation to try to remain objective and investigate the claims fully anyway. And if you are of the crowd that believes that false allegations destroy lives, well not believing true allegations also destroys lives. And I think this is a case where the police and investigators do not necessarily need to be open with the media until a charge has actually been laid because that's part of the problem too. There's a difference between being investigated for something, charged for something, and being convicted of something. So I know it would take a lot to reconsider how the media thinks about reporting on crime, but in my personal opinion it would be better if crimes were reported when there was a conviction, not before. Then with a full investigation you can decide to lay a charge of sexual assault or a charge of a false allegation and both with a thorough investigation would be justified depending on the situation. Despite having told you most of the theory of this film it still worth watching for the personal examples that are given in it. It's one of the rare documentaries that has the ability to change minds.",True
7,6,Unraveling the Complexities of Justice,kcwlsw,n/a,16/08/2025,"Victim/Suspect, a documentary available on Netflix, dives headfirst into the murky world of criminal justice, shedding light on the intricacies and complexities that surround the lives of victims and suspects. While it may not be a groundbreaking masterpiece, this thought-provoking film manages to present a multifaceted narrative that challenges our preconceived notions and leaves us pondering the very nature of justice itself.The documentary's greatest strength lies in its ability to confront us with uncomfortable truths. By juxtaposing the perspectives of both victims and suspects, it compels viewers to reevaluate their assumptions and question the binary concept of guilt and innocence. Through compelling interviews, firsthand accounts, and expert analysis, the film reminds us that the lines between victim and suspect can blur, and justice is far from black and white.One of the film's commendable achievements is its nuanced portrayal of the impact of crime on both victims and suspects. It humanizes individuals on both sides of the equation, forcing us to confront the devastating consequences experienced by victims, while simultaneously highlighting the complexities of the lives of those accused. By painting a comprehensive picture of the ripple effects of crime, Victim/Suspect challenges our empathy and confronts our inherent biases.However, while the documentary succeeds in creating empathy and sparking introspection, it falls short in certain aspects. The pacing occasionally falters, with moments that seem to drag on, diluting the impact of the narrative. Additionally, the documentary sometimes brushes the surface of the issues it raises, leaving viewers craving a more profound exploration. Perhaps a more in-depth analysis of the structural flaws within the justice system could have elevated the film's impact and opened doors for larger societal discussions.Despite these shortcomings, Victim/Suspect deserves recognition for its ability to foster dialogue around complex social issues. It forces us to question the dichotomy of victim and suspect, and the very foundations on which our justice system is built. By encouraging viewers to grapple with the grey areas of crime, punishment, and rehabilitation, the documentary serves as a catalyst for broader conversations about our collective responsibility in shaping a fairer and more compassionate society.In the end, Victim/Suspect may not reach the pinnacle of documentary filmmaking, but it certainly offers a respectable and thought-provoking exploration of justice. It serves as a reminder that behind every victim and suspect, there are layers of human experiences, and our pursuit of justice should not overlook the complexity of those stories. As we navigate the labyrinthine paths of crime and punishment, this documentary invites us to tread carefully and question our assumptions, for only then can we strive for true justice and healing.",False
8,10,I Have Never Felt So Validated,justsixblack,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is the most important documentary I've seen for women and girls in recent history. I tried to report my abuser when I was 18, and I too was not believed, and then arrested for False Report. It took a lot of courage to come forward and finally turn in my abuser (who'd been assaulting me for years as a child). This was many years ago and my case was eventually dismissed by a very no nonsense female judge who saw right through it all. That case cost me a lot of money and it scared me so badly. I thought I was going to jail for the rest of my life. That's how the cops treated me. Like I was the worst criminal they'd ever seen.Even though it was dismissed, to this day I have always felt ashamed of myself for being arrested before. It's the one and only time I've been in trouble. That shame ended watching this documentary. I am not alone, and neither are you. Someone is finally listening. THANK YOU!Ever since my arrest, I have never called the police for help, ever again. Even when I really needed it. Even when I was viciously assaulted in a public place and left beaten and partially naked. If they didn't believe me before when was being sexually coerced by an older man for years whilst underage, why would they believe me now? Especially with False Report on my record? The cops told me it would stay on my record forever, even if my case was dismissed and that I should just ""tell the truth"" before I can't get a dismissal someday. My case did get dismissed, and to this day I don't know if it shows up on my record. I just know I'm still too scared to call the cops for help because I never want to end up in handcuffs ever again.This documentary made me cry like I've never cried watching a doc before. The validation I feel now knowing that I'm not alone and I'm not some menace to society. Every woman and girl needs to see this!!! The damage is irreparable and my abuser went on to assault MANY young girls after me! That's on the cops, not ME! Not US!",True
9,10,Always have a lawyer present when talking to police,rachelk-watson,n/a,16/08/2025,"A must see for everyone. Never ever speak to the police without a lawyer present and always remember they can outright lie to you about anything and everything. This is yet another doc about police manipulation and taking advantage of a vulnerable population. Truly disheartening. It is disturbing to see the kind of men depicted in this doc, but everyone needs to be aware of these predators and how they take advantage of those they claim to like or help. Not only should this be required viewing for police, it should also be required for all 8th graders. I had heard of this happening but had no idea just how widespread it is. Our justice system may be one of the best out there, but it needs improvement.",False
10,9,America lets rapists escape to easy,18Buddha,n/a,16/08/2025,"I read some of the reviews and wow some people with the 1 ratings.. yall know those ppl for sure sexually assaulted someone before or support that behaviour or they are cops themselves.1 person was saying it was a Bait n switch ? Here I'm thinking what Bait n switch? It was exactly as it was said to be.. Police recieve a report of a sexual assault and make an arrest on the victim. That sounds about right if u had even watched the documentary yep.Another commenter probably on crack starts talkin trash about these women as if they really were making false reports which means they didnt even watch the documentary, all they did was probs watch 10 mins in lol.This documentary points to a persistent problem in America & some ppl can't understand why victims would be pressured into admitting something? Like really ?These girls just suffered trauma that cause most to get into a life long drug addiction or suicide n now their being treated as suspects & not even in their right mind probably when in there & their being coerced through ruses that they are the suspect n lying. Have you people really not seen the many many cases out their of adult suspects who were coerced into a confession of committing a serious crime and then found to be innocent?All you people bashing these victims for how they acted, well I also thought as you did when I was younger, that how can girls suddenly change their story & not be more adamant on their version of events. I was ignorant as you ppl are now, but through time I ""learned"" alot and now I see things differently. Who are we to say a person must behave a certain way when scared? Suffering PTSD? Experiencing trauma thats so fresh just few days old & then treated like a suspect? Also the interrogation videos in this documentary were incomplete, you think all it took was 1 minute of coercing to change their stories?Maybe some of you have no idea how police interrogation works but they wear u down over time with repeated questions asked in different ways and when your a victim u cant imagine how scary it is for these underage girls to feel with a grown male cop berating them as lying and a suspect.I hope you sick people don't ever have it happen to your own family members cause when you go reporting it, the cops just may treat ur wife or daughter or family exactly how they treated these victims and exactly thats how u think of them.",False
11,10,All parents of a teenager should watch this with their child,karimari79,n/a,16/08/2025,"1 out of 3 women are victims of asult and those are just the ones that report it. I believe every parent should sit down with their teenager and watch this documentary.Young girls and men who report asult every day, but are often written off or worse, criminalized themselves because it's easier than actually investigating the crime. From the time we are little, we are taught to trust the police but sometimes they can re-victimize the victim by either poor training or lack of empathy.This documentary was extremely informative and well made. It was an eye opener, because I never knew that women who were assaulted were being convicted of ""false reporting to a police officer"" because of our broken justice system.",False
12,10,Impressive and Informative,byankamelissa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have to say the documentary was very well done. It demonstrated true journalistic work, which is of rarity today.I was not aware how intentional police deception can be when investigating a sexual assault case, especially how the investigation can intentionally turn the victim into a suspect and railroading her into recanting his/her story. That's not investigative work. That is intentional and malicious investigation seeking to ensure the victim's claim is not deemed as the truth. That is wrong.Very impressed with her journalism and am excited to see what she will tackle next. We need more journalists like her.",False
13,1,Strong on emotional opinions and political tropes. Light on facts and investigation.,marktikalsky,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerStrong on opinions and political tropes. Light on facts and actual investigative reporting. Either the females in the documentary had the worst attorneys in the world, or (more likely) the documentary purposely skips over incredibly important evidence and facts discovered in the cases.This is not a documentary or investigative reporting. It's a person with a soundbox that already had a political narrative in mind and was going to push it no matter what facts or evidence is uncovered. You are innocent until proven guilty in the US. There was no proof of rape in any of the cases. And, I am sorry, but you can't just prosecute someone for a mere accusation with no proof. That would be ridiculous, but that it is what the creator of this film is pushing for against men, but not against women. The women all plead guilty, the film just glosses over why. A guilty plea in of itself is still not enough to judicially punish someone. You still need some proof that the defendant committed the crime (false reporting) beyond a guilty plea and clearly a DA and Judge agreed the women in 2 of the cases falsely reported. The film leads you to believe that the police also had absolute power in these cases . That's simply not how the justice works. A judge, a DA, and the police all agreed that 2 of these women should have been prosecuted for false reporting. The other they charged with theft, but didn't pursue anything and let her go freely. Judges, DAs, and police are not usually friendly with one another, but in these cases all came to the same conclusions. The film skips over why entirely.",True
14,9,well done,tezzahols,n/a,16/08/2025,"Despite the ones who gave this a low score, probably because their either incompetant police or they are more focused on trival matters instead of the big picture that these women were assaulted and the lazy or corrupt legal system let them down and jailed them for daring to report a crime commited on them, there are a lot of documentaries on how lazy, stupid and corrupt american law enforcement is and how corrupt the legal system in America is, and i don't think it will change till they get properly educated and trained officers in the police force, and start to fine the incompetant ones, the same with the prosecuters who with hold eveidance so they can win a case on a lie.",False
15,10,Great documentary/investigative journalism,tahseen-kamal,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerIt was very distressing to watch police making arrests of sexual assault victims without proof! I am not surprised as that's how patriarchy has brainwashed society to think that women are liars when they are accusing men of assault. It's disturbing nonetheless to see how victims of rape were not given the due support rather got arrested on the spot without receiving legal counselling. The statistics is so bizarre that only 30% of the sexual assaults get reported and only 1% of them ever get prosecuted. It's absolutely terrible for sexual assault victims who can be both females and males. 1 in 3 women would get sexually assaulted in their life time whereas 1 in 6 men would get sexually assaulted. So it's harmful for all the victims when they don't get believed. And are told lies to recant their statements without due process.,True

The uniform itself should spell out how can I be of service. Why do they apply and study then get the job to protect and serve only themselves? In today's world all kids have to be so aware as to not tarnish their reputation especially on social media. Unlike when we went to school our reputation was word of mouth.

17,8,"Necessary to Watch, Hard to Listen to",dragonstealeye,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is an extremely well done documentary.It's a clear statement on how flippantly detectives treat vulnerable victims when it concerns sex crimes, especially when the rapist is known to them. It's filthy, demeaning, and cruel for police officers - a body of individuals were generally told to trust - don't have an interest in actually dedicating investigative work to a case. In the cases cited in this show, it was made clear these police officers felt it was easier to gaslight/manipulate the victim into not believing their own story because they were vulnerable, and these officers did not want to do the investigation. (In one case depicted, they never even contacted the suspect; in another, the officer did not interview them. Instead, they accepted a written statement from him that was handed to him in-person.)This documentary is detailing how the journalist untangled these cases to find an overarching theme of dismissiveness from police officers when concerning sex crimes via personal witness interviews, personal victim walkthroughs, recorded police interviews, police reports, surveillance, and even an interview with one of the detectives. I read in other reviews people were complaining it does not respect police officers or police procedure, yet I don't see how a journalist consulting experts, gathering evidence, etc to corroborate the victim(s) statements she was able to help; the journalist made it very clear, too, she had to remain highly objective about this and not just flatly believe these victims without evidence, hence why she got evidence.The point of this documentary is to prove there isn't a unilateral goodness/hard-working disposition in every police officer we encounter. It's clear these officers did not respect these victims, they conveniently used the law to lessen their workload, and had no problem cajoling people into inadvertently confirming their ""false reporting charge"" because the victims became unresponsive to their accusations, which leads the officers to claim ""victim recantation.""With this documentary, I can understand why anyone would feel fearful to report a sex crime to the police if they had one to report. It is completely understandable. However, I hope this doesn't happen, because it genuinely will make it worse. The best way to interpret this documentary, I believe, is to understand if you're ever in this situation, you must be there for yourself even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You must believe in your own experience, Police officers can evidently be lazy, and you never know what police officer you might be interviewed by, so always believe in your experience. If you feel like you're being treated as a suspect, if your laws permit, try to leave and/or retain a lawyer.I greatly empathize with all these victims. I hope this never happens to anyone else.",True
18,9,An Important Watch - For Everyone,GirlRebuilt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having walked through the so-called criminal justice system for sexual assault myself, and then again with one of my children, this one hit close to home. Cases of false reporting do occur - but extremely rarely. Almost all of the time the victim is telling the truth. Even if one stumbles upon a fundamentally decent detective, they are trained to treat the victim with the utmost suspicion and disbelief in the initial interview to satisfy the courts that all due diligence was done to ensure they were telling the truth. Even children are not exempt from this treatment- but the perpetrators most definitely are. They are treated as though they are believed until it is proven otherwise, a courtesy that is not extended to victims. It is a system completely devoid of empathy and humanity. And when being interrogated as though they are a suspect and met with disbelief in the wake of such a life altering trauma, a victim can be easily rattled by lies told by unscrupulous police officers with their own agendas. It does not surprise me that the officers featured in this documentary were easily able to confuse and plant seeds of doubt in the minds of these young women. The way that these women were treated is repugnant, unprofessional, inhumane, and also entirely typical of police departments both in the US and Canada alike. This is an important watch for everyone from women to parents to law enforcement and members of the judicial system. Cases like this should never happen. But they do. They happen at a frequency much more than we are aware. If police are overwhelmed by the amount of sexual assaults being reported and the work that that involves, then they should organize and develop much stronger tactics to crack down on the perpetrators. Yet it should be no surprise to anyone to see them take the easier route, silencing victims, instead of putting in the work to deal with the systemic issue of astronomical rates of sexual assault.. Throughout the system as a whole, from the first contact with a police officer right through to the completion of the court process, victims are deterred from coming forward by poor treatment, lack of support, and re-traumatization thereby compromising public safety. This is a most extreme yet by no means rare example of that kind of deterrent. This documentary is a clear and thorough examination of the failings of our system and is an important watch. Change is desperately needed.",False

Whether or not I'm the person who invented the term ""exoneration tv,"" I know hands-down ""Victim/Suspect"" is among the best I've seen on the service... because it may be the first to focus on women.Ms. De Leon, the reporter/narrator, is terse and excellent in helping several victims tell the horrors they experienced when they turned to the police for help after a rape. One victim is not present--because after a rape by a well-connected Southerner she was arrested for making a false report, and then committed suicide. In terms of grabbing the viewer's attention, the filmmakers made the right choice to include her story as early in the documentary as they did.I wish so strongly Netflix would consider a subsidiary service for social conservatives who aren't heartless and who may perhaps know what the other side of the tracks are like. Shame, that I got notified of ""Victim/Suspect's"" availability before I cancel my subscription yet again.One final comment: the women brave enough to participate in this documentary were pretty, bright, and connected in some way with higher education.

20,9,A must-watch for all men - shows how men in general treat women compared to their own gender,flowerpetal-06659,n/a,16/08/2025,"A tragically sad but poignant depiction of the biased and sickening male perspective of women in America by men in uniform, the very men who have sworn to uphold the law, be righteous and to protect the residents that they serve.For those with an interest in psychology, the toxic misogynistic culture is clear from the very beginning. Not only do we see that all those who are questioning, investigating, researching, helping and fighting for the double-traumatised victims and survivors of rape are overwhelmingly women, apart from the single detective (who should be lauded for his compassion, fairness and courage for speaking the truth) we see a general pattern of these male officers, detectives and sherrifs all the way to the top, holding the female gender in such poor regard. They are disrespectful & mistrusting of the young girls and women being interviewed, downright unempathetic and forcing their own narratives of what ""they think happened"" on to these women who visibly can be seen shutting down mentally and physically! The detectives are absolutely clueless on the etiquette of interviewing traumatised sexual abuse/rape survivors and there isn't a single female officer or female detective or even a trauma officer present with the rape victims, how disheartening that this is how the police and justice system operates. On the contrary, the way they treat the male suspects instead is the opposite - bantering with them about their day, going along with their story 100%, short and sweet encounters!It is extremely difficult as a woman to watch how demeaning and sexist the actions of these male officers who instead of serving justice arrest defenceless victims of rape and then posting out to the world, name, picture and all how these women are criminals, making them targets on online bullying and attacks. Is it shocking at all that some of the rape survivors kill themselves on account of this life-changing dehumanising ordeal and the rest who shut down simply go along with these detectives' own narratives?More of these documentaries need to come out and I have utmost respect for the young investigative reporter, who is often seen moved to tears from the plight of these rape survivors who go to the police, we need men and women who have that empathy and compassion and a true sense of what justice is.

21,2,Bad editing,foxtwc,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not a well laid out story. The narrative follows a few cases and doesn't really make a case for showing what they seem to be trying to show.I think the interviews as shown jump around to much and before any closure is made around the conviction they are on to the next case to show a similar thing happening.Unlike journalism, the criminal court system relies on evidence and testimony. When interviews outline a series of events, and then subsequent questions change those events ... it becomes difficult to find out what really happened. This is made even more difficult when videos are around that do not show a forced situation or corroborate with what the victim says happened.This makes it difficult for the court to find a person guilty of rape. As the court has its own rules to follow when it comes to taking away someone's freedom.Why the victims would change their testimony to willing admit they made things up ... the viewer will never know. There is no real evidence her aside from self confession of false claims. These people should have talked to an attorney when being questioned by the police.The show itself is a mess in how it was edited together. The rookie journalist really needs to learn how to weave a story together that approaches this subject from a third person point of view.

I'm sure there is at least one African American victim story that could have been to this documentary. This documentary could have been more inclusive. Although I applaud the documentary for bringing awareness to rape/assaulted victims, even so the assault victims in the African American communities need their stories to be heard and shared as well.",False
24,5,Something of a snarl.,irvingwarner,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Victim/Suspect"", 2023A good documentary can take on a very complicated subject and render it digestible within an acceptable viewing time. Sadly, I did not encounter this with ""Victim/Suspect"". The narrative became more complicated as it moved along, many repetitions and shots of our reporter at airports, in her room, etc. This wasted time. As it went along, her editorial board kept widening the scope, not narrowing it. Also, the reporter assured the viewer how ""unbiased"" she was going to be, i.e. Sitting as a neutral before all the facts and such. That is a load of horse feathers, plus I don't care if she is biased-who would not be?! The documentary drifted into the tedious zone and lost me. One thing this elderly, male viewer can conclude, any woman accursing someone of rape better have an advocate with her at a minimum (better if they are an attorney)-anywhere in the country. In Alabama, however, they should call in the reincarnated versions of Clarence Darrow and Ruth Bader Ginsberg.",False
25,3,Netflix is not believable,mrcjking,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI want to start off by saying that I have been accused of lying when filing a police report.I also want to say that I don't necessarily believe all of these ""victims.""
Unfortunately, Netflix were so believable when they made Making Of A Murdere, But it turns out that they were extremely biased In the reporting, considering the latest show that has come out, dissecting their ""journalism.""
Maybe Netflix didn't do the reporting, but they are responsible for showing the content.I also wonder why they kept showing the video of the car going by at night without a car following. They never Did show a following, but they kept talking over that video about how the police were holding back evidence? There was no other car.My point is, just because everyone acts the way they do in This show, doesn't mean that everything is the way that it is expressed.Also, that journalist is a grown woman- and how she talks. I cannot stand when people talk in that cadence of popularity it doesn't make any sense.",True

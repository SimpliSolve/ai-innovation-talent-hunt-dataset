1,8,A Great Documentary Portrait of a Great Man,meathookcinema,n/a,16/08/2025,"A new addition to Netflix, this documentary chronicles the life and activism of Peter Tatchell who has campaigned for gay rights and indeed, human rights since his late teens.Born in Australia, he campaigned for issues such as Aboriginal land rights whilst at college.He moved to Britain where days after his arrival he learnt of the Gay Liberation Front, promptly joined and then within a month was a major player who wasn't just participating in events but also helping to organise them.The film details chronologically his campaigns including the time when he ran as a Labour candidate for the seat at Bermondsey in the by-election in 1983 after joining Labour in 1981. He was openly gay and the opposition's campaigns against him were based on homophobia and smears with hatred directed against gay people being rife within wider society at the time.Whilst you may think Hating Peter Tatchell is a congratulatory affair that does nothing but praise Tatchell and his actions, this isn't the case with the campaigns staged by his group OutRage being explored and spoken about his the many people who contribute to this film. Such actions as outing several prominent people within the church as gay whilst they condemned homosexuality in the name of their faith and disrupting a prominent Easter service given by George Carey the then Archbishop of Canterbury made Tatchell as many detractors as supporters in the press.But it was Tatchell's direct action that switched public opinion towards him. Seen as foolish by some (although no one can deny he has guts) to stage citizen's arrests on such figures as Robert Mugabe, Mike Tyson and even Vladimir Putin, he suffered physical retaliations in some of these actions and has suffered semi permanent brain damage as a result. Tatchell saw this as being a small price to pay when fighting for the rights of others.The contributors include such luminaries as Stephen Fry, Tom Robinson and Ian McKellan who interviews Tatchell. Even George Carey is interviewed about the incident regarding the disrupted Easter service.The film shows that Tatchell had the tenacity, strength and conviction to openly oppose certain people and their views whilst fighting for the rights and dignities of often marginalised groups. He wants equality and this means fighting for all sides regarding this. An example of this was when he fought for heterosexuals to have the right to have civil partnerships as he could see that they provided some advantages to some rather than traditional marriages.We are also taken on one of his campaigns so that we can see how nerve wrecking such an event is, how much planning goes into it and how courageous Tatchell is. The event in question is Peter going to the Olympics being held in Russia to expose the country's vile stance regarding gay people there.From revolutionary agitator to national treasure but don't let that fool you. Tatchell's work isn't over yet. This documentary shows just how valuable the Tatchells of this world really are and what REAL activism looks like.",False
2,7,Overlooked & Forgotten History Of A Difficult To Like Man.,heratyplant,n/a,16/08/2025,"A sweeping looking at an infamous media & political character, love him or loathe him, his heart's in the right place & for that we must be grateful for his indomitable spirit in the face of often mountainous odds.We see here that Tatchell's messages were regularly received somewhat poorly, mainly due to his rather humourless & dour approach, such a shame he didn't employ humour as it always helps the medicine go down, obviously that's just not who he is.Produced by Elton John & David Furnish, it's a decent effort & has some balance, with critiques of his methods, but it could've gone further; being interviewed by Sir Ian Mckellen for instance, it's obviously a soft, non probing chat & not a Paxman like drill down.From a technical, film making point of view, the audio mix is very poor, as the 'background' music is either at the same level of the dialogue or quite often louder, this makes it both difficult to hear what people are saying & enjoy the subject matter; it's really rather annoying!The sadness, maybe even tragedy that's followed from Peters' righteous struggles is that people didn't realise or recognise when the fight no longer needed to be fought & they now hunt out anything or anyone in order to be offended & 'cancel' it, continuing a struggle that has largely been won, in the west at least. Here he also talks about 'solidarity' which is a wonderful thing, but this has lead to the trap of alphabet group identities; I don't identify with any group mentioned here, I'm me, I hope group identity becomes the busted flush it so obviously is.As a viewer, who just happens to be gay, it's a tough watch & I used to find Peter a bit of an irritant, as I was just trying to fit in, but when you hear of his injuries & his continuing defiance, he really must be saluted. I just hope that people will now come together & STOP looking for the differences between us.",False
3,7,Ridiculous Music Volume,joehendry,n/a,16/08/2025,"Almost unwatchable. An interesting documentary utterly ruined by the level of music whilst the speech is continuing. I tried every setting on my TV but nothing worked. What a shame. Do the producers not check this? Perhaps the involvement of Elton John and David Furnish placed a real bias on the music, I don't know, but it truly is overbearing. The actual documentary is excellent and is full of clips from the past. It also illustrates the damage religion did and continues to do. It moves at a good pace and features some national treasures such as Ian McKellen and many brave people who had a much tougher time than people have now.",False
4,10,Incredibly brave man,mls4182,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tatchell started his activism as a very young man in the late 1960s. That took a lot of guts! If not for people like him, society would not have progressed this far. This biodocumentary chronicles the discrimination and hate people suffered in the past and sometimes, in the present. It isn't pleasant to watch but important to remember. I think we all need to be reminded once in a while to be kinder and more tolerant to each other.In not sure I agree with his outing tactics, but he didn't go after mere closeted people, but those gay people working against gay equality.",False
5,10,Loving Peter Tatchell!,nikrandell,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched an incredible tribute to one of my all time favourite heroes, Peter Tatchell, in 'Hating Peter Tatchell' on Netflix. A brand new documentary, superbly crafted by Chris Amos, featuring not only Peter, but Sir Ian McKellen, Stephen Fry, Elton John and many others - all waxing lyrical about one of the most significant human rights ambassadors of our time. Everybody should watch this and learn about the man who has so often lead the way in trying to make the world a better - and kinder - place for everyone, whilst frequently putting himself in grave danger and suffering horrific attacks and injuries along the way. Top marks.",False
6,6,Argh! Sound levels make this unwatchable,tvpgfdn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whoever did the sound levels on this documentary should be fired. The music is far too loud against the dialogue, making it very difficult to watch. Such a shame they ruined it.",False
7,10,A must see film,rolandcat,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a great film.To see what drives a man to effectively dedicate himself to fighting the injustice against LGBT people unfold has been wonderful. So much has changed and this film slickly replays and captures, at pace - not a dull moment, the story of the World's no1 protester of our time for LGBT rights. Seeing the old news clips, the way the film is constructed with music underpinning parts of the narrative in a mischievous way. To see Jimmy Somerville, Peter Tatchell and Sir Ian McKellen interviewing Peter and in news clips. This could have been an eight-hour film with the topics touched upon - the film-maker has at pace moved through the headlines and combined that with personal backstory interviews a footage to build a more rounded picture of a man many fear and many more others adore. Things in many ways have got better for LGBT folks in many Countries, with more work still to do. If Emily and Sylvia Pankhurst could only have had a film made about their work like this? We live in a fairer society with thanks to their influence. The film really does pay a tribute to a lifetime of work by a human rights activist and captures this for all time for future generations to understand. Love him or loathe him - the film is a solid watch to see.",False
8,n/a,A great tribute to a modern day hero.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Peter Tatchell has devoted his life to human rights, justice and equality. This is a tribute to a man who is determined to make the world a better place. May his work continue for many years to come.",False
9,7,Great story,andy-eakin-1,n/a,16/08/2025,But telling of it ruined by constant dramatic music blaring over the interviews making it hard to actually hear what's being said.Worth a watch but have your remote to hand to turn up and down as needed.,False

11,10,MUST SEE FILM,kkemeny,n/a,16/08/2025,"An amazing documentary about a man who has dedicated his life for justice.Brave beyond belief. Selfless and truthful. The documentary should become compulsory subject for high school students at their social studies, history and leadership classes. Thank you for all the documentary footage and also the assistance of Ian Ian McKellen and Stephen Fry as Peter Tatschell's interviewers.",False
12,10,Peter Tatchell gets things done!,blueeyedkipper,n/a,16/08/2025,"You can't please all of the people all of the time, so will be the case with Tatchell's tactics as shown on occasion here. But this guy is a true and real activist. The word 'Brave' keeps being bandied about but he just is, incredibly so. I recall much of his work over the years, seeing it again here in a documentary is astounding. He makes his point! I loved this, i also found it extremely moving at points. The world needs more activists of Tatchell's calibre, those who refuse to lay down and die for bigots or otherwise. Well done Christopher and all best wishes Peter.",False
13,10,An amazing doc,FilmL6918,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tatchell is like marmite.You either love him or hate him. In either case, the film rightly captures the facets of the person and that of the LGBT+ rights campaigner.It was very moving to hear about Carey and about Tatchell's mother.I found the film entertaining and informative and the music kept you immersed.Love him or loath him, he is a force to be reckoned.",False
14,10,OUTSTANDING FILM,tlcgaz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a must see for all, oppressed or oppressor should watch, seriously people like Peter Tatchell should be highly honoured in society his bravery and courage fighting against injustice of all beings, animals included, where would we be without protesters? Please watch and think of Peter fighting for us all.",False
15,10,Proudness,ricramey2000,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you for putting your life on the line for us. Loved the documentary. Also, thank you Elton J. And David F. Thank you again.",False
16,10,A real must-watch film.,selektadan_i,n/a,16/08/2025,"With a wealth of archive material, this film shows the dedication of Peter Tatchell, fighting for human rights for his entire adult life. Whilst some of his actions have been controversial, such as the 'outing' of gay bishops, his aim has always been the betterment of society, and he is a shining example to us all.",False
17,8,Good doc with extremely high volume music track,abfabjb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a good doc brought to us by David Furnish and Elton John. However, the instrumental background music track was so loud, I had to turn on the subtitles to understand what was going on. Since Elton is a musical guru, you'd think he would have caught this before it went
to Netflix.",False
18,8,Inspirational Human Rights Activist,steventhomas011062,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAlthough I had heard the name Peter Tatchell, I didn't know much about what he had done. I found this documentary to be very interesting and inspirational. Peter was a very courageous human rights activist - especially for the LGBTI community. I found his background and family situation to be fascinating - totally unaware that he was originally from my home city of Melbourne and his parents were so much in to their strong religious beliefs. As a member of the LGBTI community, I have so much to thank Peter Tatchell for - often putting his life at risk to fight blatant discrimination to create a more accepting, safer and understanding environment in which to live. Unfortunately, at the end of the documentary we learn there is still a long way to go - with consensual same sex relationships still illegal in 72 countries.",True
19,10,Amazing,eszterhercsik,n/a,16/08/2025,Such a fantastic documentary to watch. Peter Tatchell has an extraordinary life and he fought in his whole life in what he believed. He is a true icon. This documentary shows the history and all his life experiences. Fabulous interviews and real life footages. Must watch it. Beautifully filmed. I can highly recommend it.,False
20,10,A Very Accurate Depiction of An LGBT Activist,indagar,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to expose and challenge the powerful, you have to expose and challenge yourself. And that's what Peter Tatchell does: he exposes his sexuality, ego, self-righteous, and caring personality to get the attention on decisive problems like discrimination, torture or political tyranny.The film shows this controversial and inspiring character from different sides and we get to notice how important is to raise our voices against injustice, even (and specially) if that demands a lot of bravery from us.",False
21,10,Impressive & thought provoking!,luciecswan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to attend the Qld screening and was extremely impressed with the seemless integration of footage from interviews and rally's spanning over his many decades as an activist. I was truly shocked at everything he endured and a little in awe at his resilience and commitment to do what is right, no matter the cost. A clever and thought provoking tribute, huge congratulations to a very talented director Christopher Amos and everyone else who got on board to tell his story!",False
22,10,Legend,ejelkhan,n/a,16/08/2025,Peter Tatchell was and remains a legend. The documentary is a testament to his enduring legacy. I was honoured to have been featured in the film.,False
23,9,Heart in the mouth bravery,meyastar,n/a,16/08/2025,"You genuinely feel scared for his life when you watch this film. Peter Tatchell has been a part of my activist radar since the 80s. Not always appreciated for the work that he does; not always liked for the work that he does. Nevertheless a man who has fought tooth and nail for gay rights across the world. Too much of a trouble maker to ever be awarded (surely he should've had an OBE or an MBE by now), but enough of a figure to instil fear in the minds of the oppressors he targets.",False
24,10,A must watch for any one agitating for a better world,danielpebrace,n/a,16/08/2025,"Powerful documentary. Great historical footage and a star line up of interviewees. If any one as labelled you a trouble maker and you've been on the right side history this documentary is for you. If you haven't, watch it and learn.",False
25,10,Who could me more deserving of an MBE?,dave_shorrock,n/a,16/08/2025,"Peter Tatchell has been a constant refrain throughout so many of our lives. This film shows the many battles that Peter fought on our behalf ito achieve equality. And with the right on the rise again, it serves as a timely reminder of the need to carry on the fight and the struggles ahead. What higher accolade could Peter have earned than Dr Carey's (albeit belated) words of endorsement. As an Australian by birth, what more fitting honour would the award of an MBE in the New Year's Honours List? I'm sure his mother would be delighted to accept it on his behalf 😉",False

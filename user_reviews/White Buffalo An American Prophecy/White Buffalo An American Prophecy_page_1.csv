3,10,Mitakuye Oyasin,moonrabbit-97695,n/a,15/08/2025,"""All are related"", and if there is one central message to take away from this film, it is that message of truth and hope. This journey to wisdom was taken not just by these four brothers but by all who took part in its making, and it will take you along as well. Many of the elders featured in this enlightening documentary are no longer with us, and what a blessing that their words are forever preserved here. We can be grateful for their willingness to teach and to share, bequeathing us with their sense of urgency, and with a desire to reach out to our other Wisdom Keepers and preserve their legacy before it is lost. The path to mending the hoop lies in this direction, and White Buffalo Calf Woman will show us the way. Aho.",False

7,1,The False New Age Version of Lakota Beliefs,J_B_Bees,n/a,15/08/2025,"Where to begin? The ""Fourstars"" are actually the Adlers, white imposters who exploit Native beliefs for profit. The opposite of prophets.Mayas (Not Mayans. Maya is the noun, Mayan is the adjective) don't have white buffalo prophecies.Neither do Hopi. Nothing even close.Neither do Assiniboine, which the Adlers falsely claim to be for profit.Basically the producers of this film got taken in. White Hollywood types desperate for spiritual meaning found white imposters and entirely unrelated beliefs and naively passed them off as genuine Lakota.See newagefraud dot org slash smf and look up the Adlers AKA Fourstars. A long ugly history. CNN, truTV, and In session were also conned by him.",False

It is the balm that heals the heart that everyone should, no, must take the time to experience.Mitakuye Oyasin.",False
9,10,A truly wonderful movie experience!,marshallbart,n/a,15/08/2025,"""White Buffalo"" is an extraordinary film. Twenty years in the making, it captures the essence of native American spiritual traditions through interviews with elders, shamans and wisdom keepers from a variety of tribes, with emphasis on the Lakota tribe. Watching it, we feel the great loss of having this deep spiritual connection with Nature and Spirit systematically beaten out of these great Nations by the European invaders of this continent. And yet we see in these surviving wisdom keepers little trace of hatred or resentment towards those who destroyed their way of life and committed mass genocide upon their people.Instead, we find an all-encompassing love and sense of unity will all humanity, all races. Indeed, the central metaphor of the film, the birth of a white buffalo, symbolizes for natives the emergence of a new epoch, a golden age for all the earth. Another symbol that is important in this wonderful film, is the medicine wheel, which is equally divided into four colored segments-red, yellow, black and white-symbolizing the four races of man on earth sharing a common circle. Early in the film these two symbols come powerfully together with the extremely rare birth of a white buffalo, which then proceeds to change color each year, into yellow, red, and black.Adding to the delight of ""White Buffalo"" is the repartee between the unlikely filmmakers of such a project--four Jewish brothers from New York City--whom you will grow to love as much as the fascinating elders and shamans they interview. I found this film to be extremely moving and inspirational, and freely admit to tearing up several times. I recommend watching when you are in a quiet, contemplative, introspective, patient mood, prepared to let these treasured elders speak to your heart.-- Bart Marshall, author of ""Becoming Vulnerable to Grace,"" ""Christ Sutras,"" ""The Perennial Way,"" and ""Bhagavad Gita: The Definitive Translation""",False

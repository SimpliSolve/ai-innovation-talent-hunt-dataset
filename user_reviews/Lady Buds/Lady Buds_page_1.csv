1,10,"Truly the BEST ""bugs"" in the garden",erekblaschke,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've worked closely with both Chiah Rodriguez & Karyn Wagner. They're industry leaders and trend setters in their practices. With top notch flowers, extracts, topicals and tinctures... these lady's are leading the way!They are two, great, big-hearted women that took me in, under their wing and helped me in my cannabis venture. They invited me up to their properties and they also came down to mine. They provided me with valuable information which helped me grow and understand how to do better with this powerful medicine.I miss them dearly, as prop-64 ruined many of the small people in the industry. But with the roots these gals have established; they're not going anywhere for a long time!I believe in their practices and the medicine they create. Support these ""lady bugs"" and it will pay off in the end! Lots of love!",False

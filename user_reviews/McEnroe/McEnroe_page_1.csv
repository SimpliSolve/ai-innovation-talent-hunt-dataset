1,8,Well Made Documentary,holarsch,n/a,16/08/2025,This cinematic attempt to capture the essence of Superstar John McEnroe works on so many levels that we thoroughly enjoyed almost every moment of it. John is quite candid about his evolution from a total brat during the years that he played tennis to the mature individual who he has evolved into. From his terrible tantrums to the tender moments he now shares with his extended family. His candor should be appreciated. The bonus in this film is the high quality that the cinematographer introduces. The film offers insights into one of the greatest tennis players that the United States has ever produced. John has also become one of the beat announcers for the sport. His insights and commentaries enhance all the major tennis events at so many levels. Who needs Pickleball when we John McEnroe calling tennis matches.,False
2,7,Insightful documentary on McEnroe,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""McEnroe"" (2022 release; 104 min) opens, we are in ""Douglaston, NY"" and today's John McEnroe talks about getting an edge on a tennis player, and on life. His wife of 25 years remarks: ""People don't know John."" We then go back in time, to John's upbringing, and what makes him want to become a tennis player. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the film.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from Barney Douglass (""Warriors""). Here he bring a refreshed look at the career and legacy of John McEnroe, with full cooperation of McEnroe himself, as well as those around him (including his wife but also his grown children). McEnroe's troubling emotional outbursts are addressed head on, as is John's complicated relationship with his dad (also his manager for much of his career). Perhaps most surprising is the contribution and commentary by Bjorn Borg, McEnroe's idol and fierce rival in the early 80s. Turns out these 2 had (have) a lot more in common that one might surmise. Bottom line: I found this an insightful, even refreshing, look back at the phenom that was McEnroe, with all of his good and not so good aspects. In other words: a flawed human being (just like you and I) who happens to a terrific tennis player.""McEnroe"" premiered on Showtime this past weekend. If you have any interest in tennis, or in John McEnroe in general, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
3,7,Achieves What Most Sports Films Don't,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anyone interested in learning about the perils of perfectionism should check out this insightful documentary about legendary tennis star John McEnroe, the most successful player ever in men's singles and doubles competition. As writer-director Barney Douglas's new Showtime documentary poignantly reveals, for all of McEnroe's success, he was never satisfied with his accomplishments, a product of an upbringing in which he was perpetually pushed to be the best and came to look upon himself as a failure for anything less than perfection. Placing so much pressure on himself led to his infamous ornery streak and caused him to become known as the argumentative bad boy of the tennis world, both on the courts and in his dealings with the media. That reputation carried consequences outside the sport as well, including his hearty partying ways and troubled relations in his romantic and family life, issues that, in turn, caused his game to suffer. But those challenges eventually prompted some intense soul-searching that forced him to examine the entire spectrum of his life, both in the areas in which he had become overly obsessed and those that he regrettably neglected. Admittedly, some aspects of the storytelling are presented in somewhat overly pretentious ways, but, fortunately, these elements don't unduly impinge on the overall narrative. But this shortcoming is made up for by the picture's ample archival footage, as well as its telling interviews with tennis stars Billie Jean King and Björn Borg, McEnroe's family members, and his playtime buddies, rock stars Keith Richards, Chrissie Hynde and Patty Smyth, his current wife. The result is a surprisingly in-depth look at an athlete's life, a production that goes far beyond what many sports documentaries achieve, let alone attempt. Advantage viewers.",False
4,7,VIEWS ON FILM review of McEnroe,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you don't know anything about John McEnroe, well you've probably been living under a rock. If you do know something about ""Johnny Mac"" (and I do), well 2022's McEnroe isn't gonna reinvent the wheel in terms of insight via the tennis great. Yeah we know he got mad and irate on the court. Yeah we know about his rivalry with Bjorn Borg and his friendship with the late Vitas Gerulaitis. Yeah we know that he plays a mean guitar and is a lifelong New Yorker. Now let's see how the whole shebang is handed out shall we.So yeah, McEnroe is almost like a bullet point presentation that's chronological and la-di-da in its approach. The actual John McEnroe would never admit to it but his whole presence here verges on self-serving (no pun intended). But wait, I digress. McEnroe is expertly filmed by Barney Douglas and that's from a look and interview standpoint. Douglas goes for the 70s grain approach, showing rough cut archive footage that feels like you've entered a freaking time machine. McEnroe bleeds nostalgia when tennis was at its peak. It's all about the headbands, the wooden rackets, the rock 'n' roller, tennis line of action. John McEnroe was truly um, John McEn-fro. Natch.McEnroe's hook is that it paints John as a regular Joe, a sort of mere mortal who still puts his pants on one leg at a time. I mean why else would a film crew follow him in present day, roaming the outskirts of New York City in the middle of the night. Uncanny. McEnroe also gives us probes of John McEnroe's inner circle that are candid and raw. The camera sort of peeks in when it knows it shouldn't. I can dig it. Overall, McEnroe is a documentary of a tennis legend that's an exercise in well worn style. It's worth recommending even though we've seen this net corded rodeo before.",True
5,6,"Some interesting reveals, heavy-handed theatrics",insideout098,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI grew up watching McEnroe and have no doubt he was the greatest tennis player of all time. I also know that he was hot headed and a perfectionist.But this story is really more about the bittersweet realities of the after party, when the spotlight of fame fades and retirement forces once-famous athletes to face another set of equally challenging realities. The constant thread of John walking alone on dark Manhattan streets, answering public phones as if they're calls from the afterlife, came across as a bit dreary and over-wrought.I would have preferred to see more of his youth and beginnings in tennis; where he practiced, who his coaches were, what they had to say about him, his life at school, with friends.The general impression was that he was suddenly THE John McEnroe and walking onto the court at Wimbledon with Jimmy Connors, who purportedly ignored him.Light on the beef, in my opinion.",True
6,6,McEnroe,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whilst it is quite interesting, this documentary, it is still little better than a self-indulgent reminiscence by the man himself that features virtually no contributions from those folks who suffered from his petulance and immaturity - both on the court and elsewhere. Set against a long stroll through his haunts in New York, it takes us on a chronologically ordered career retrospective focussing on his rise to global success on the tennis court; his ""superbrat"" behaviour and his flawed relationships with friends and family alike, but it's all done very much on his own terms. His moments of revelation - long since appreciated by anyone who watched him and his tantrums as they grew up (including me) - are presented by him in an almost celebratory way. Could he have achieved what he did - which, by even the standards of the day in his sport are nothing particularly remarkable - without the attention seeking strops? Sure there was gamesmanship going on a-plenty, but he seemed to revel in the extent to which he ""recreated"" tennis - or that is certainly the perspective I took from this very disappointing Barney Douglas feature. It completely lacks objectivity allowing this undoubtedly talented but supremely peevish man to write his own story and though there is the slightest hint of a mea culpa at the end, it's all very much ""How History Should Remember John McEnroe"" - by John McEnroe himself. Worth a watch, but under-delivers.",False
7,10,this is really a story of love...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"A story of love to life, to family, to serendipity and fortune, its love to physical activity, its a hymn of human complexity, and not to forget the love of the sport called tennis.i remember those days when borg and mcenroe battled the fields of wimbledon, the raging moments of john and the cool moments of bjørn borg, that drew even me to an open asfalt field with imaginary nets and lines sleizing the ball with my slezinger bat, gee those where the days of glory.A very well made production, an original take on strolling through new york in the midst of the darkest hours of the day along with john m., a very humanized mcenroe makes the world so much more sympathetic, so if you love tennis, have a look at this documentary.well made and thank you john for all you gave to us back then.",False
8,9,An intimate portrait of one of the greatest in sport,Andfinally,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love him or hate him, if you were a tennis fan, 40 years ago, then like me, you would have been privileged to have watched the most talented man to have walked on a tennis court.This is the story of how John McEnroe met with triumph and disaster. How or why he frequently exploded, and had a meltdown on the tennis court in the most self-destructive way is never really answered.However, there is no beating around the bush when it comes to why his invincible status, especially in slams, came to a premature end.There are candid interviews with his wife and some of his children Who reveals much about themselves and their father.This is a must see for all sports fans.",False
9,8,The Guy You Love To Hate But Then Love,tadted,n/a,16/08/2025,When I was a a kid I thought he was the brat that the media labelled him - and he was! This documentary is narrated by the John that grew up and could look back and see himself as others saw him. He was a brilliant tennis player but he was a BRAT. When I watch tennis now I always hope he will be a guest pundit because he's not a brat that didn't learn how to be a person. He's very funny and self-deprecating now because he no longer has to prove himself. I wanted him to lose when I was a kid and now I'm glad he became a great champion - I'm guessing we both grew over time and we see life in the bigger picture!,False
10,1,Nasty Little Guy,Kamandi73,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is basically an excuse for the lack of a human being that John McEnroe was. It wants you to understand what a tortured crumb of a person he was, so in the light of history, McEnroe can seem like he is less of a turd.Having grown up during his era of rudeness and nastiness to everyone that he felt was under him, I can say this guy is despicable. McEnroe kicked every little person all the way to the top, and then kicked them some more. He was and is a vile human being, and he has spent his retirement years trying to retroactively clean up his reputation.McEnroe had no love, compassion, or respect for anyone. This documentary should have interviewed the hundreds of people that he humiliated and abused during his career and afterwards. Where are their insights into the sub-human that is John McEnroe??",False

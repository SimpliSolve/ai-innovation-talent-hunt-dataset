1,1,A made-up story,MrocznyKrytyk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Budda showed his made-up story in the video. Kids are swallowing it like pelicans!A film-like product that forces fans to pay for a movie ticket for a cottage industry YouTube video. Totally appalling laurel of its own awesomeness.Most of the scenes shown in the film are ones you can watch for free on YouTube. I am disappointed that such a 'documentary' was made. Despite the fact that initially it was supposed to be something completely different and something much more interesting, but of course, as it is Polish productions - they had to spoil everything so that children would have something to watch despite the fact that the whole story (supposedly true) is one big hoax.I do not recommend this movie to anyone! - if you already want to know the plot of this film then just watch these materials on YouTube.",False

1,8,Even better if you're not overly familiar with Jerry.,tommyjonzie,n/a,16/08/2025,"I give this doc an '8' as well. The extended scenes taken from The Day The Clown Cried when put next to 'Life Is Beautiful' shows how lacking it was in every department - Production, directing, casting, acting (mid-level Hogan's Hero's) and especially writing. Jerry looks back on it very intelligently, however. And you see it's failure from the word 'go' is a constant source of torture for him. The documentary is probably best looked at as a bio of Jerry Lewis himself more than the film and of that it's a success. I liked his few late life serious acting roles which I thought were always first-rate.",False
2,8,Clown really needs to be seen one day,DanTheMan2150AD,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like its subject, From Darkness to Light is not entirely complete, but it doesn't cut the viewer short on some jaw-dropping revelations. The Day the Clown Cried has always been an odd fascination with me, as is the case with a lot of lost or rare media, and this is as close as we'll ever probably get to seeing the film in its entirety. The documentary stems from a place of affection and respect, Lurie and Friedler giving us a compelling account of how this beloved entertainer tackled the darkest subjects. The duo trace the film's ill-fated progress which led to Lewis abandoning the project, or, did the project abandon him? It's generously illustrated with both behind-the-scenes footage of the film being made as well as raw footage from the film itself, presented mostly chronologically. The real coup here was their ability to get Jerry Lewis himself to sit down and talk at length about the trials and tribulations of making the film and its aftermath that haunted him to the grave. Painting a picture of a compelling story of Hollywood hubris that's by turns moving, shocking and blackly funny, whether or not The Day the Clown Cried will ever receive a release remains to be seen, but we can always hope.",False
3,8,Holocaust comedy? Are you kidding?,GTornatore,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSuccess has many parents, failure is an orphan. This documentary explores when the orphan realizes his failure, with perhaps too much self-serving angst.The movie within this documentary is Jerry Lewis' unreleased ""The Day The Clown Cried"". Jerry pans his own movie. The shown clips reveal that it was ambitious but not very good. Good comedy needs a hint of reality. Jerry forgot this.The movie was doomed because of legal rights and failures. Were there other factors? Making funny out of the holocaust? Perhaps it was Jerry Lewis' expression of sympathy for the German side, justifying the ""just following orders"" excuse?Merely showing Lewis expressing these currently politically incorrect thoughts may doom this documentary to the dust bin. That would be too bad because it appears to deal honestly with Jerry Lewis, the comedian.",True
4,n/a,Remarkable story of the making of Jerry Lewis' unfinished DAY THE CLOWN CRIED,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT (2024) Well done documentary on the history of Jerry Lewis' legendary uncompleted THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED (circa 1972). Over the decades, much of the speculation has focused on why Lewis never finished the film and why he didn't ""allow"" it to be shown. A couple of years before his passing in 2017, Lewis' materials were donated to the Library of Congress with the proviso that they not be shown until this year (some scholars have seen the half hour incomplete assemblage - as well as, Harry Shearer).What Directors Michael Lurie and Eric Friedler do so well in this documentary is to trace the film's ill-fated progress which led to Lewis abandoning the project - or, did the project abandon him? It's generously illustrated with both behind the scenes footage of the film being made as well as raw footage of CLOWN itself (presented mostly chronologically, one can put together a shortened rough cut of what the final film might have been like).Still, the real coup here was their ability to get Jerry Lewis himself to sit down and talk at length about the trials and tribulations of making the film - and its aftermath that haunted him to the grave. Lewis had long grown weary of discussing his ""failure"", but here, shortly before his death, he opens up. Of course, being Lewis, one must always be leery of how truthful he is at all points. Still, he seems refreshingly frank for the most part. His deep self-criticism of himself as a writer, director and actor rings true. Honestly, much of the CLOWN footage backs up his hesitance about what he made.The behind the scenes machinations about getting the film produced are astonishing themselves, with the shocking reveal that the underlying rights were never properly secured - nor was the footage! Just as disturbing is just how far the screenplay of CLOWN itself goes. OMG. OMG! OMG!! Give Lewis credit for following the story to its horrifying conclusion.THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED is such a holy grail (or is it ""Unholy""?) that it's best that it was never completed nor released. No single film could ever match one's expectations of it - for good or for ill. The surviving footage is sufficient to approximate what Lewis and the unfinished film would have been like. Make no mistake here - THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED does not exist as a full motion picture. There is missing footage. Scenes never filmed. Even the edited sequences are very rough. Most importantly, Lewis isn't here to edit nor complete whatever exists into his vision. An extraordinary amount of digital work would have to be done just to make it presentable even as an extended short subject.Let it be.For now, FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT (and a German documentary, DER CLOWN) is sufficient evidence of the production. Some things are best left to fate.FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT had it's U. S. premiere on TCM. So far no further screenings have been publically announced.",False
5,8,movie that never was,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary of the legendary 'lost' Jerry Lewis 1972 film, ""The Day The Clown Cried"". Jerry plays political prisoner Helmet the clown in a Nazi concentration camp where he is eventually given the task of leading a group of kids to gleefully walk into the gas chamber.The early section has a lot of present day celebrities and commentators talking about the rumors of the legend. Harry Shearer is one of the few who claims to have seen a copy. Apparently, some film cans of the working copy were secreted away from the bankrupt production house on their way to the trash. This does show some clips of the unfinished film. Some scenes are enlightening on the tone of the film, but it is tough to know if it's actually good or not. I don't think that this can be a comedy and that's the central question.The big difficulty for the production is a lying producer who didn't get the rights to the story. In one section, Jerry confesses that the film is not good. He does pull it back by saying that it's almost wonderful which is not good enough. It's a dodge. I find myself wanting to call Jerry out on some of his comments. I'm not sure that he has a grasp on what the film needs to achieve. This is also well before Life is Beautiful and I've always felt that Life's broad comedy never worked due to the subject matter. It would have been great to have Jerry finish the movie. It would have been controversial and maybe set him on a different path.",False
6,8,LOST CLASSIC...?,masonfisk,n/a,16/08/2025,"A current documentary on the infamously abandoned Jerry Lewis holocaust vehicle The Day the Clown Cried. Back in the early 70's Lewis set out to make a film about a circus clown who ends up in a concentration group who manages to keep the spirits of the children up while imprisoned there until the wheels of cruelty move them towards their ultimate fate. Lewis felt he had a winner on his hands as evidenced by the various talk shows he went on at the time where he was hyping the near completion of it but then through budget cuts from an unreliable producer & the dawning realization the material was not shaping up to his standards put the film's release into limbo for many years which even by the time of his death & asked about it, he'd say the project was dead. Through interviews w/some of the survivors of the project w/Lewis himself interviewed in length before his passing, we get an idea of what went wrong (especially those who have seen an assembly of the film like Harry Shearer). A fascinating watch since I'd heard about this film within the last few years w/this doc providing actual scenes cobbled together so an audience could make heads or tails of what could've been. Considering subsequent films like the Oscar winning Life is Beautiful & I think Robin Williams made one entitled Jakob the Liar, one wonders if Lewis' take on similar material might've beaten the others to the gate for acclaim & recognition. We'll never know.",False
7,7,from darkness to light,mossgrymk,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting and watchable documentary that I cannot help but feel is taken way too seriously by the film makers. It appears, to me at least, that they regard Lewis' not being able to finish his holocaust comedy/drama as a tragedy almost commensurate with that of Welles not having the final cut on ""Magnificent Ambersons"" and that the film's producer, Nat Wachsberger, to whom they assign the blame for this iniquity, is such an odious philistine that his face must be blocked from our view. I mean, talk about comedy! The fact is that, based on Lewis' own, unusually honest assessment and the out takes that are shown, Wachsberger did Lewis' reputation a favor by pulling the plug on the bathetic, pretentious embarrassment that is ""The Day The Clown Cried"". B minus.",False
8,9,So this is the answer... partially,Nozz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I see from another review that this film was marketed to TV. And indeed it starts like a TV program, with a set of teasers to convince you to watch. And it claims to solve the last great mystery of cinematic history-- the mystery of what went wrong with Jerry Lewis's never-released film ""The Day the Clown Cried."" The documentary does apparently provide a definitive answer regarding the project's collapse as a business venture, and it shows us Lewis's own dissatisfaction with the footage although Lewis's own feelings and behavior are more difficult to explain and may to some extent remain a mystery forever. We do see several minutes of ""The Day the Clown Cried,"" and it's obvious (to me at least) that one major mistake was casting Jerry Lewis himself as a German civilian in World War II when the New Jersey whine couldn't help creeping into his voice and putting him apart from the non-American actors playing the other Germans. Other criticisms are brought up, and they're all thought-provoking, even if-- unlike some of the interviewees-- you don't consider Jerry Lewis a great genius of 20th-century cinema.",False
9,7,Every Clown Wants To Play Hamlet,boblipton,n/a,16/08/2025,"What happened to Jerry Lewis's unreleased movie THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED? Interviews with Lewis, Martin Scorsese, Pierre Etaix and other people involved in the production are intermingled with extended clips from the film.It's hard to think of Lewis as a serious film maker. He seems to be a maker of faces with the occasional small extended gag. Yet anyone who can actually do it will tell you that making people laugh is a difficult procedure, and directing it effectively for the screen is harder yet. Lewis did the former for twenty years, and the latter for ten until the pressure of doing both got to him and he decided he wanted to prove himself as a serious film maker and actor. Traditionally, all clown want to play Hamlet. Instead it was a movie about a broken-down clown who keeps the children happy in a concentration camp.And between the shoddiness of his producers and his own inability to thread that needle, it broke him as a film maker. He didn't direct so much as a TV show for seven years, nor appear in a movie for nine, when he appeared in Scorsese's THE KING OF COMEDY, where his performance made the point: if you take away the things that delight us with laughter, what you are left is a serious actor. And his later interviews in which he talks about his ""lost"" movie -- which resides at the Library of Congress -- make me wonder what he might have done with HAMLET: not as the lead, but as the director.",False
10,9,As close as we'll ever get,pmtelefon,n/a,16/08/2025,"""From Darkness to Light"" shows us as much of Jerry Lewis' ""The Day the Clown Cried"" as we are likely to ever see. I'm sure Jerry's movie would be a hard one to sit through but I would like to give it a try. The scenes that directors Eric Friedler and Michael Lurie show are interesting but they also give the impression that ""The Day the Clown Cried"" would be a pretty hard movie to get through. But then again, maybe not. I didn't grow up watching a lot of Jerry Lewis movies. My parents didn't like him. As I got older, I started watching his movies and I became a fan. Jerry Lewis was a genius when it came to filmmaking. He might have actually been able to pull that movie off. Sadly, we'll never really know.",False
11,9,Jerry wept,caspian1978,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bottom line, Jerry Lewis made a good movie. With all the doubt that the idea behind the movie that was created, none of it adds up to the fact that Jerry Lewis made a movie worth watching and worth talking about. My previous review covered why the movie was shelved and had given multiple reasons why due to endless speculations that have come from the mystery on the movie. Now, with this amazing documentary, the mystery has less speculation and more promises behind the reason why it was made. I was not expecting the amount of empathy that Jerry Lewis accepted in his struggles to make this movie. That alone showed his devotion to not only his craft as an Artist but his strong devotion to telling an important story with an equal message.",False
12,10,Missing People and hidden Face,michellaronde,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why did they hide the producers face , if he left on his own then why hide his face , and why with all the Actors still Alive why were they not asked to talk about working in this film , i cant believe that if they were asked that all refused , why are there no interviews with the ones that were actually in the film like Hariett who is still alive and so many more . Why do some say unfinished but Jerry says it was finished just editing was left so I hope that they decide to release it someday in a theatre for the people to see , did the producer that left ever talk about why he left , i cannot find any info on this .",False

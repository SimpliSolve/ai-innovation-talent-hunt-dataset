1,6,needs a remake about the 24-25 hornets,albertoaarredondo,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary proves how most of the time in sports, there is always a story to tell behind the seasons we remember as trivia answers. The 7-59 Charlotte Bobcats are remembered by NBA fans as the worst team in leagues history, but there's a lot of things that happened behind the scenes that make you realise, that this team wasn't even that bad.Mentality is one of the most important aspects of sports as an athlete. Jordan is the best example of this, since his winning mentality made him won 6 rings. This Bobcats team had a mentality problem that is ironic from the squad-building point, because of who was in charge of the team.Bois probably doesn't like Jordan very much, and you can tell by the way he narrates and belittles him in his speech. But I understand it. Mike was an incredible figure as an athlete, but after the century changed into the 21st, Jordan became one of the most hated and misbehaved celebrities on the planet, hurting his image. He even had to do a documentary that was shelved for almost two decades so he could regain some popularity (and he succeeded at it).What I'll give to Bois, is that what he wrote, the script for this movie, is amazing, giving us tremendous quotes and showing us the immense amount of research done for this documentary, showing us tons and tons of newspaper quotes and articles from the different Charlotte Bobcats focused press at the time.This doc also shows us how rigged the NBA is at times. Being the worst team in NBA history, you would expect that at the 2012 NBA Draft Lottery, the Bobcats would get the 1st pick -who everyone knew it was, unanimously, Anthony Davis from Kentucky-. But Adam Silver had other plans.The Charlotte Bobcats are one case of study, full of great stories about the people involved in this horrible season, and there's also a lot of reasons behind the failure. The documentary even gets you to like players like Gerald Henderson and Boris Diaw, exploring their personalities and why they succeeded or failed at the time during their Bobcats years.Bois should make a newer version of this modern day Hornets team tho, specially taking into account that Mike ain't the owner no more. Right now, the 24-25 Charlotte Hornets led by LaMelo Ball, are 7-22 in the NBA Standings. And just like the 2011-12 Bobcats, there's a lot of reasons behind the failure this season, just like it happened back then to the Bobcats, a team which arguably, was not bad at all. A team that in fact, had playoff expectations.One thing is certain though: the Charlotte and New Orleans NBA franchises are cursed. Something needs to be done for them to finally compete again.Only complain about the documentary for me, which makes it a 3-star, non-obligatory view, is the fact that the flow feels stagnant because of the decision to use the less amount of archive footage possible. Staring at the same pictures is not bad per-se, but when we're talking about a 2-and-a-half hour documentary instead of a 15 minute video essay, it becomes boring to watch at points. Specially when you talk about certain plays or moments in time, actual footage would help to make the pace of the movie feel much better.Oh, and Paul Silas was a visionary by hating Diddy in the 2010s. He knew stuff.Director: Jon Bois

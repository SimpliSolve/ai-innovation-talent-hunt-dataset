1,9,Coming of age masterpiece,drummerlaci,n/a,16/08/2025,"A stunning and deeply moving documentary. It uniquely portrays the journey of a young adult rising from a disadvantaged background. With poignant intensity, it conveys the sense of loss and hopelessness that comes from a lack of prospects. The film authentically highlights the importance of social awareness and creating equal opportunities. All of this is done without pathos, in a raw and natural way. It is neither preachy nor overbearing, yet it strikes a deep emotional chord. An incredible piece of work.The only drawback is the slightly lower quality of image stabilization in the first 20-30 minutes, but this is entirely understandable given the level of handheld camera technology at the time.All things considered, it is a remarkable, outstanding film. Highly recommended to everyone!",False
2,8,Foreboding Opening Hints at Grim Finale,robinhendriks2013,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wonder if the filmmakers had (negative) influence. In a home situation where the whole family, including a sweet grandma, has to sleep on one bed, with a father who is a weakling and a mother who is never home because she works three jobs. When she is finally home, she feels no sense of responsibility-neither for Sanya nor for her other son and daughter, whom she has been fattening up year after year. The likelihood of a drama like this happening is greater than him diligently finishing his studies and happily going through life.The documentary shows that poverty still exists in Europe. I expect the mother would have preferred to present a different picture. This is not such a flattering family portrait; I therefore find it very brave that they participated in this.",False
3,9,Masterpiece and bait for haters,jjdjjrh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I liked this film a lot, very authentic and raw material. Unfortunately there were consequences for main hero which makes a great finale but it was tragedy for many.About argument that filmmakers benefited from kids' behavior - there are many poor families in Hungary, you cannot know who do something wrong and who can get lucky and change their path. Most of them don't but would it be any different if they (filmakers) snitched them directly, as kids?I'd like to know how the story continues, but I guess there will not be any cute imagery...:(
Other aspect is also today's totalitarian Hungary, there is no interest on human lives anymore.",False
4,10,Review of KIX - A Raw and Personal Look at Hungary's Struggling Youth,gecigranat-85424,n/a,16/08/2025,"KIX is not just a film-it is an experience, an emotional rollercoaster that grips the audience from the first frame and never lets go. Directed by Bálint Révész, this documentary is an intimate and unflinching portrayal of a young boy, Sanyi, growing up in poverty in Hungary. What makes KIX so special is not just the subject matter but the way it is presented. The film spans over a decade, following Sanyi's journey from childhood into adolescence, offering an unparalleled level of depth and honesty. It is deeply personal, heartbreakingly real, and one of the most compelling films to come out of Hungary in recent years.One of the most striking aspects of KIX is its raw, almost journalistic approach to storytelling. The film doesn't rely on dramatization or overproduction. Instead, it gives us direct, unfiltered access to Sanyi's life-his dreams, his struggles, his moments of joy, and his deep disappointments. By following him for so many years, the film captures not just snapshots of hardship but the way poverty shapes and wears down a person over time.What makes KIX particularly powerful is its emotional impact. As viewers, we become attached to Sanyi, a boy who, despite facing enormous obstacles, remains full of energy and hope. He is charismatic, funny, and incredibly resilient. However, as the years pass, we see how circumstances push him into a downward spiral, where opportunities are scarce, and survival becomes the main goal. The transformation is devastating to watch, but it is also crucial in understanding the reality of poverty in Hungary. This is not just Sanyi's story-it is the story of many children growing up in similar conditions, trapped in a cycle that is incredibly difficult to break.Hungarian cinema has always had a talent for portraying social issues with brutal honesty, but KIX takes it to another level. It does not romanticize poverty or offer easy solutions. Instead, it shows the harsh reality as it is. The film highlights the systemic failures that make it nearly impossible for children like Sanyi to escape their circumstances. Lack of education, unstable family situations, financial struggles, and societal indifference all play a role in shaping his fate. These elements are not presented in an overly political way but rather as undeniable truths that need to be confronted.The cinematography of KIX also deserves praise. Despite being a documentary, the film often feels almost cinematic in its visual storytelling. The use of handheld cameras creates an intimate and immersive experience, making the audience feel as if they are right there with Sanyi, living through his highs and lows. The passage of time is handled beautifully, allowing us to witness his growth not just physically but emotionally. There are moments of joy-scenes where Sanyi is simply being a kid, laughing and playing-which make the darker moments even more heartbreaking.Beyond its technical achievements, KIX is important because it gives a voice to those who are often ignored. It sheds light on the struggles of the underprivileged in Hungary, showing that poverty is not just about financial hardship but about the lack of opportunities, support, and hope. The film challenges viewers to confront these uncomfortable truths and, hopefully, to think about ways to create change.In the end, KIX is a masterpiece of documentary filmmaking. It is personal, deeply emotional, and brutally honest. It stays with you long after the credits roll, leaving you with a mix of admiration for Sanyi's strength and sadness for the unfairness of his situation. It is a must-watch for anyone who wants to understand the reality of poverty in Hungary, and more importantly, for anyone who believes in the power of cinema to tell real, human stories.",False
5,n/a,"Horrifying, in every sense",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"For me the film didn't add anything, but at the same time it made me angry. How can you, as a filmmaker, assist anyone to commit crimes (breaking windows, vandalising public property). The really funny thing to do here would have been to keep the kids there until the police arrived.The young filmmakers didn't seem to have a clue what to make their film about, so instead of dealing with the millions of problems lying around, they created one, in case it would turn into an even bigger scandal, which would become docu material.I'm not sure how it affects the psyche of a street kid to have to produce mischief for the camera in exchange for food (and/or money) and the chance to star in a docu-film that will be released later.",False
6,8,Sad afterward,figueroafernando,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou can go down the street and film every passerby for free. The first woman, ""because she looks good"", is reminiscent of Leonardo Da Vinci. I think it was Walter Isaacson who told me that he used to follow unknown passersby in his city, like a stalking shadow for long distances until he tired them out and they allowed him to draw them, just because he liked their faces. With the following question to a couple of drifters: what is more powerful, destiny or will? He shows me that his questions only seemed to be gratuitous, equivalent to asking them, should Hamlet or should he not kill Claudio for the death of his father, whose ghost has just revealed the truth to him? The cinematographer has finally found the face to draw: Sanyi and Viktor, his street buddy. And it is absolutely right that the boys shoot 500 obscenities, interspersing smiles with palindromes and strange syntaxes of the use of the word ""f..K"" while being filmed. It's only fair because the cinematographer also shoots a lot of frames per second without any right over them. At least he offers them pizza. The pair of kids agree to exchange shots, as long as he doesn't post it on the internet, they ask him for food. And if anyone thinks that both boys are playing, they are wrong. ""This is very serious,"" says Sanyi while he dismantles furniture from the street and sweeps puddles from the sidewalk, hours before meeting other homeless people who are cooking something. It's ratatouille - They say the correct way is with mushrooms and rice.The director did not spare himself the mother's reprimand in the middle of the street, nor the misfortune of almost any kid grumbling about doing his homework and next to Sanyi a scratched toilet and their skateboards behind. But this documentary is not about the interviewer or the director or the cameraman but about Sanyi and Viktor. It is about childhood and the freedom of being children, and even in precarious conditions, giving themselves the luxury of being the ones to cheer up those who look bitter or sad in the streets. We will see them hanging inside public transport or smashing an umbrella by hitting it against a tree. Moni authorizes them (the director) to take them out of the 28 square meter house if he returns them before 7 PM to avoid problems with social services. However, it was always only about the first half of the feature film. After 40 minutes of the film we see Sanyi and the intentions of the work are understood. I wonder how many years the producer and director had to wait, because Sanyi looks at least 3 years older. The questions to Moni regarding what Child Protection is asking for. An electric heater and for the house to be improved.A few minutes earlier we saw Sanyi urinating in one of the holes that they have improvised for that purpose near (or inside?) the same building. Then Sanyi uses weighted dumbbells and shows his flat stomach. His dreams have changed a bit. In the first part of the documentary he wanted to have all the money in the world to train and be the strongest guy in town. Now he wants to finish primary school and train to be a mountaineer. The images change with the change of 15-year-old Sanyi, whom we always see with his girlfriend Rami. But the sad outcome will be the trial that will be held against Sanyi and his friend Ati. Playfully and without thinking too much, as was customary, but also without any malice, they put nail polish remover on a mattress and lit it on fire. The fire destroyed a building and one person died. Both were sentenced to 6 years because they were minors. Sad ending when the last images show a Sanyi over 15 years old.",True
7,8,Should the film-makers have interfered?,rozi72,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSince towards the end, the protagonist (Sanyi) gets involved in an unfortunate crime/incident, a lot viewers (including myself) will feel uneasy about the whole film in retrospect.The film-makers follow the street kids for several years on the streets of Budapest. Saying that these children come from a disadvantaged background is quite an understatement, depravity might be a better word to describe their family circumstances. However, being able to roam freely, which is something not many kids are able to do these days, conveys an almost romantic sense of freedom at the beginning.I'm not suggesting that the film-makers made these kids look for trouble or even that they encouraged them to do so, but their approach definitely feels like that of an anthropologist or even a nature documentary maker (you know, one who would not interfere to save the antilope from the crocodile). There is a scene quite early on when one of kids almost gets hit by a car and the film-maker does not seem particularly concerned.All in all, I cannot answer the question in the title because these guys are documentary film-makers, not social workers or teachers, but still, the children so blatantly lack any positive influence from adults that one cannot help but wonder.",True
8,8,"Gorgeous Cinematography, Devastating Story",matepolcz,n/a,16/08/2025,"KIX is a devastating movie with gorgeous cinematography and fantastic editing.The beginning is very slow and it took me a while to get attached to the characters, but after the first third ended, there was no going back. I though I knew where the story was going and I kind of did, but I couldn't have predicted what happened. This story is absolutely devastating and you know that from the beginning. On the other hand I love how this film is neutral in every way. It gets you attached to the characters, but definitely shows you their bad side.The cinematography is just absolutely insane with great editing. I love how everything is really messy and shaky in the beginning, but by the end the camera movement becomes a lot cleaner and calmer. The pacing isn't that good though, the first third of the film is pretty weak in my opinion.KIX has a devastating story, but its technical achievements are outstanding.",False

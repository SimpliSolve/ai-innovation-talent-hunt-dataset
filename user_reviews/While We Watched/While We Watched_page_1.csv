1,10,An eye opener,movie_goer82,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an eye opener on the current state of Indian news channels in 2022. India is constantly declining on Press freedom index and is currently on 142 place out of 180 countries. This is a matter of shame for largest democracy of the world.There has been sharp decline in the credibility of the news channels since 2014.Once media used to report and debate on the real issues faced by the citizen. Now, all toxic debates on religion are done to distract the viewers and polarize them.The media is now not making it's viewers well informed, but well intolerant.Ravish Kumar is the only news person left in the mainstream media who is still raising the relevant topics in his prime time. This documentary is all about the right kind of journalism he is doing, and the challenges created by the government to destroy the last ray of hope of Indian journalism.A Must Watch for all and introspect.",False

5,10,A must watch...!!!!,Content_Lover,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a must watch newsroom drama. Showcase the reality and struggles of journalism. Ravish Kumar in this Documentary is exceptional.The first 30-40 minutes of the film move very fast. The editing is quick, scenes and locations transition fast. While We Watched gives the feel of a newsroom where different people, with different ideologies and beliefs, work together. Social media will have us believe that everything is black and white, but in the real world, adjustments and compromises have to be made. The film gets into the heart of that.'While We Watched' is a vivid portrait of a man i.e. Ravish Kumar who reminds us that by knowing you are doing the right thing is its own reward.",False
6,10,This film is more important than the Oscars.,J0RWAL,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all, political parties do all kind of politics to win elections and it is somewhat acceptable. This is not just in India but everywhere in a democratic country this happen regularly but problem is the role of media in the society. We all have witnessed the kind of hate in the society that was targeted on everyone's mind from all major news outlet. It already brought India few decades behind the rest of the world in terms of common mentality of the society. Also, we should be thankful that there was no large scale riot. Whole India went to the edge of the cliff but somehow managed to not fall down because of journalists like Ravish Kumar, Purna Prasun Abjpai, Abhishar Sharma, etc.And NDTV which stood against everyone else and continued their reporting clean and unbiased. They tried their best to keep society together.Prannoy Roy who stood behind the scenes also deserves all the respect.",False

Taken for granted, unscrupulous beings find ways to exploit the naive and harrass those who speak the truth.Strangely, it's not yet made available in ailing democracies of the world.Also, a good reminder that failing democracies can't tolerate truth.As journalists continue getting threats and harassment by goons hured by those in power, India has aged back continuously for a decade.This is just summarising what happens with honest beings and the price one has to pay remaining honest.

While We Watched movie review: Vinay Shukla's documentary on Ravish Kumar documents Indian journalism's lone voice Aditya Shrikrishna Published On: 13 Sept 2022 10:00 AM Ravish Kumar in While We Watched Vinay Shukla's documentary paints a picture of struggle and disillusionment that is at the centre of journalism in India. Starcast : Ravish Kumar, Deepak Chaubey, Sushil Bahuguna Director: Vinay Shukla Rating: 3 star Highlights While We Watched documents the daily battle of making peace with doing the right thing while not getting heard or rewarded. While several journalists and activists have been arrested, Ravish Kumar becomes an important if privileged figure just by virtue of being on a television at prime time. Kumar becomes the lone voice with a direct line to a large part of India. Vinay Shukla's documentary While We Watched focuses on the life and work of TV journalist Ravish Kumar of NDTV India, fighting not just the government by asking the right questions under a din of hate while wading through misinformation, but also trying to keep a channel afloat with ratings, censorship and budgetary cuts vying for attention. At the offices of NDTV India, a cake is cut when someone has quit or retiring or leaving the media for greener, more stress-free pastures. Kumar gets out of his modest office to have a slice, smiling only when he must and a world-weary look on his face as his medium is chiselled away by the system. It gets emotional at times like when his producer leaves after almost a decade (he tips his hat to her in that evening's bulletin) or when he wishes he could have run someone's story as a going away present.The first half hour of While We Watched continues in a blitzkrieg of quick cuts and unannounced change in locations and narrative. The stylistic choice helps with recreating a newsroom (Shukla is following Kumar throughout) and the attritional nature of news in the last few years. An assassination attempt on Umar Khalid is followed by a video of two Hindu nationalists proudly taking responsibility. ""How did someone walk into the centre of the nation's capital with a gun?"", asks Kumar in disbelief. Next minute, he's listening to a junior colleague talk about the relationship between increasing unemployment and this systemic fostering of hate and youth mobilisation to sustain it.",True
10,6,"Has its heart in the right place, but..",curmudgeon86,n/a,16/08/2025,"This fly-in-the-wall style documentary follows journalist/news-anchor Ravish Kumar during the lead up to 2019 Indian general elections. Ravish, then in NDTV, was the one prominent news anchor who did not devolve into a government mouthpiece.The documentary depicts Ravish fighting a lonely battle even as the world around him is being transformed beyond his recognition. In other channels, news anchors constantly scream at the screen denouncing critics of the government as ""anti-national"". Their frenzied denunciations are a hit with the viewers, Ravish's sober self reflection is not. His channel is struggling--funds are limited and employees are leaving. There is suspicion of foul play from the government in hastening their demise.But for Ravish the most worrying thing is that the public themselves are changing, putting the government on a pedestal and imbibing the anger of the TV anchors at critics. Ravish himself receives abusive phone calls.There are small victories, but few and far between. Ravish and his co-workers go through one disheartening moment after another. But even though he understands it is a losing battle, Ravish maintains his voice and his conviction. As he says in an award ceremony, ""some battles are fought to tell the world someone was there in the battlefield.""While We Watched captures the atmosphere of despondency well. But it limits itself too much with the fly-in-the-wall style. For those unfamiliar with the context, it can be difficult to pick up key information from the snatches of conversation. For example, the rise of the angry anchors coincided with the rapid disappearance of ground-level reporting as the latter did not bring the views. In this docu, there are several instances when Ravish and his friends lament the dearth of good field journalists, but they would be missed by anyone not in the know.Also, we see Ravish almost exclusively talk about how other TV channels are failing at journalism, but we do not see enough of his own journalism. This ends up paining Ravish as more one-note than he is. It would have been good to get a fuller picture of Ravish at work -- to see how he approaches his work or how he mentors his juniors. Not much happens and for Indian viewers who have watched Ravish, not much new is revealed. Most of these weaknesses could have been rectified by stepping out of the fly in the wall style, adding some interviews and providing more context in places.While We Watched has its heart in the right place, but it's not going to go down as one of the great documentaries of our times.",False
11,10,My personal experience with Ravish Kumar.,barattdiscord,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am watching him from the age of 12 and I am 25 yrs old right now . He is the one who made me a citizen of the democratic country instead of just an Indian. I have nothing but love admiration and respect for this man. It is sad and sickening to see how the same people, who praised him before 2014, who praised him for the work and questions he asked, but suddenly as soon as they came into power and he started questioning them instead (which is a journalist's job) , he suddenly becomes anti india and baised according to them and a systematic harassment and hate campaign was launched against him calling him traitor Pakistani and what not. Fortunately some people's morale and love of their work specially public service work like journalism is unshakeable and unconditional and he is one of those rare ones who truly showcased that. As an indian, I am proud to have someone like him in our media along with many other but at the same time when I see what he and other good journalists goes through everyday I sometimes feel that we Indians really don't deserve people like them all we deserve is a shouting clowns like Arnab goswami.",False
12,7,While We Watched,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Though I really did not much care for the busyness of this documentary, it does offer us a fascinating - and worrying - glimpse into the state of journalism in this most populated of democracies. It follows acclaimed anchorman Ravish Kumar who fronts the NDTV primetime news slot. His style of investigative reporting is to challenge the establishment on a range of legitimate issues and gradually, we see how the zeal of others makes his life a living hell. He is accused of being a traitor, amongst other things, and has a permanent police bodyguard as the threats to his person, his home and his family are real and violent. It is all the more concerning that, at a time when there is increasing clamour from some quarters for more state regulation around the world, it becomes clear that the state is not averse to a bit of censorship too. Though none of this is specifically proven here, the jamming of their transmissions, the investigations into their staff and the generally threatening nature of those with attitudes opposed to his free thought style of reporting has a chilling effect on not just us watching it, but on his colleagues who find themselves gradually tiring of the constant intimidation and the feeling they are banging their heads against a wall. Vinay Shukla also illustrates quite effectively that whilst the West is banging on about historical racism, the divides in this huge nation are current, visceral and largely based on religious lines - a sort of historically rooted religious sectarianism that is as irrational as it is unpleasant. There is a scene in which Kumar complains about too much information on the screen, and that is a flaw I would level against this production as an whole. It is far too hurried. The style of presentation is repetitive (how many opening links do we need to see?) and the constant use of the competitors broadcasts is effective for a while but loses context - you will probably have to be much more familiar with the Indian television market than I am to fully understand just who is who, and for what they stand - and a few moments of explanation at the top would have helped enormously. That said, though, Kumar comes across as a considered and responsible man determined to keep the agenda based on what actually matters to the people of his country, and not just to the jingoistic - and though set in the vibrancy of India, this could apply just as readily in territories where the media emphasis is capable of corrupting the debate and, potentially, the lives of many.",False

His fearless and unyielding pursuit of truth and unbiased reporting has set him apart as a great journalist.Ravish Kumar's unwavering dedication to the cause of unbiased journalism and his courage in challenging the status quo have earned him both admiration and respect.

Impressive work done by Vinay Sukla and team. Expecting more such eye opening jo sach ko sach ki tarah se dikhane wale stories. Truly amazing. Storyline, cake cutting, and wo jo haar na maanne wala scene with the fellow journalist at the last, that clip win my heart. Itne gehere andhere mein kahi na kahi ek ujalein ki ummeeed to hain. And also if you can see ravish after NDTV, now he has his own channel to do work he wants to do. Now he has his own Freedom and it's a super costly thing anyone can have. He paid the price and he is free from these things at least for now. So yeah the conversation with the fellow journalist is the beginning of this I guess.",False

19,6,Important but repetitive,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"In much of the world, democracy is under attack, not from would-be military dicators, but from ""populist"" politicians who rig the game and push lies through a supportive media. India is one such country, and 'While We Watched' follows Rajesh Kumar, an independent journalist under increasing attack from the Indian state. Unfortunately, it's not such a great documentary. It shows us Kumar fighting depression as the government becomes increasingly assertive and his television station faces financial and legal difficulties. But it doesn't explain those issues in detail, focusing instead on his own emotional reaction. And the journalism we see him do only involves him attacking the pseudo-journalism of others, an important job, but if his channel only showed him complaining (as opposed to reporting), it wouldn't be surprising if no-one was watching. I suspect this is the decision of the film's editors, rather than a full representation of reality; but the framing of Kumar as heroic, isolated, and doomed can gives the viewer the feeling of being lectured (as well as the sense that this might also be the experience of Kumar's viewers as well). Fly-on-the-wall is not the only way of making a documentary, and while the technique is good for conveying a situtation emotionally, in this case, it leads to repetition and a lack of deeper explanation. What we do learn, however, is plenty worrying; one can only hope Kumar and his team can keep up the fight.",False

He is as biased as there was a possibility to sell it, from a victim of RJD(Lalu Prasad Yadav) to supporting them. The party caused him not to live in Bihar or continue using his surname (Pandey). What he criticises mainstream media for taking a partisan view, he does the same for himself. He has high morals, ethics, and rules for others, but not the same for himself. He has done so much hypocritical journalism - one of them stuck with me, for example - Muslims vandalised a temple in Bangalore, and he called those people should be identified with their religion. Still, he failed to apply the same principle to people supporting a political party. I can quote many examples of his biased journalism and his conspiracy peddling.",False

He showed the world that Gandhi's principles are alive till date. He showed that even a single man matters and voices are heard if raised for truth.Ravish kumar ji motivates all of them who wants to stay with the truth, who wants to question the wrong.""Even of the path of truth is tough, even of you are alone, don't stop keep walking"".As Ravish kumar ji said ""Not all battles are fought for victory, some are fought to tell that there was someone on the battlefield""

This isn't a hopeful optimistic take, neither is it a pessimistic rant. The film tactfully lays forth what the ground reality is in the world of Indian journalism. It's real and it's brutal, but it is what it is. Like John Oliver said in his interview with the filmmakers, ""you made chocolate cake look depressing.""Seeing Ravish Kumar navigate these testing waters was heartbreaking, especially knowing the ultimate fate of NDTV, which happened a year or more after the filming wrapped up.If it were up to me, I would broadcast this film on every channel every day throughout the entire election season.

1,4,Yes but why?,pqpxkmbm,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is really an amazing adventure and I really liked the images. Okay, the documentary is rather amateurish, the music often used without any need and making some situations less intense as they would have been already. But what really is ridiculous is the description. In some texts it is the largest polar desert of Europe in others even of the world! What the heck? They visited a national reserve in Sweden during the winter. That's it. The snowstorms merciless? They did not make the impression as if they barely survived. Sure, it was not without danger and they deserve respect for this trip. But merciless means ... umh ... merciless. Would the announcement have been not that exaggerated I would have given 3 more stars.",False

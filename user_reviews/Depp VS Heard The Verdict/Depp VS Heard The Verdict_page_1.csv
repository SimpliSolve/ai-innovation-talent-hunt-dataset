1,2,"A low budget, distorted telling of events",coca_cat,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA person watching this ""documentary"" with no knowledge of the case, might be very surprised when Depp wins.The production values of this film make the low budget crime shows look good. There are reenactment scenes where two shadow people (who hardly resemble Depp or Heard) wave their arms around and mime shouting. There is almost no video from inside trial. Outside court videos are more often from London than Virginia, despite the movie being about Virginia verdict. Stock images are used repeatedly.The production effort seems to have been in selecting of information to be anti-Depp. For one example, the testimony of Isaac Baruch is summarized as he fell in love with Heard like Johnny Depp did and that he was told by Heard that Depp had thrown a phone at her. People who watched the trial would likely remember Baruch emotional testimony for his description of ""phony pictures ... the fake narrative .. a fraudulent DV claim to extort and blackmail a man"" and that he looked closely at Heard who had no marks on her face. The film ends with interviews with women who say this verdict turned back the clock for women.",True
2,3,Too many boring youtubers,ggomes-01525,n/a,16/08/2025,"It has a lot of potential due to the interest of the case but so many youtubers and boring tiktokers saying things that are not even interesting or relevant to the case, made it a torture to watch at some point.This could have been a nice 2 episodes but they decided to make it a 3 boring ones and sacrificed the series with irrelevant stuff.Watch this if you want to get annoyed by random tiktokers saying things that are obvious and irrelevant, but skip it if you want information about the trial and the reasons that lead to Amber's and Johnny Deep's to have one of the most mediatic cases of this century.",False
3,1,This could've accomplished something.....,abradbury-54293,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOk so first of all, we all understand how much social media has taken over the world let alone impacted perspective, storytelling and how it influences documentary storytelling. But the TikTok and YouTube clips in this mini-document did not work. If anything, it undermined the story I think was trying to be told.Each time it would start to go somewhere, a random and unnecessary social media clip or set of clips were interjected completely dismounting you from the story. However, I did not let the tone deaf clips erase the following conclusion: AH may in fact be all the negative things JD defenders say, but he is definitely guilty. He very well may not have memory of ever hitting a woman, but he has.So many of his mannerisms, his defense mechanisms and using his charm to disarm those in the courtroom, mirrored abusers that are not famous. Mirrored abuse I have witnessed, included the abuser trying to charm me and others surrounding his victim, so they could never believe he'd be capable of doing as much.",True

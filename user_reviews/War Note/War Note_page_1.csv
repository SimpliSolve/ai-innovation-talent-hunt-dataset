1,9,A glimpse of war routine,alexpolskiy,n/a,16/08/2025,"War is mud, blood, suffering and this documentary is very immersive, thus conveying the atmosphere very well. The film is compiled of donated videos shot by the soldiers themselves, there's no Werner Herzog invading the whole thing and going on a 15-minute rant on how he views the horrors of war, it is war as perceived by the people on the front line.War Note teleports you to chill and damp steppes of eastern Ukraine scarred by conflict. And you'll be glad to be back home after 60 minutes. Not without impression though.",False

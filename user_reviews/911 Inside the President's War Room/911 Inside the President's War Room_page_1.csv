1,9,9/11 from the perspective of Bush and his inner circle,jrhicks-33450,n/a,16/08/2025,Very good doc showing footage I have not seen before. Tells a well-crafted narrative of the day's events from Bush's point of view.,False

3,7,The Day The World Fell Down...,Lejink,n/a,16/08/2025,"As the 20th anniversary of 9/11 approaches, I'm sure there will be a glut of films and documentaries re-examining the events of that awful day. This ninety-minute fly-on-the-wall documentary took us through the fateful 24 hours from the collective point of view of the American Executive and in particular President George W Bush as he and the rest of his team watch and somehow have to react disbelievingly to the events as they occur. There's notably no comment on how the aftermath played out subsequently with the U. S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, which is ironic of course given current events as we now see the seismic impact of the controversial U. S. and U. K. withdrawals of their armed forces from Afghanistan. This documentary then focuses exclusively on how Bush and his senior aides coped on a day when all their nightmares came true and while the rest of us could only watch in horror, he and they had to make instant decisions to both protect and pacify the rest of their country and indeed the rest of the world.I remember at the time there was some satirical jibing on U. K. TV about Bush's befuddled initial reaction on being told, while attending a children's primary school, that America was under attack, but while I'm no great admirer of the president's time in office, I can't imagine any human being reacting very differently to such shocking news. It has to be said however, that with the active participation of the president and his staff in this film, there was never going to be much critical comment on their actions here, so we hear nothing about the failures in U. S. Intelligence which failed to anticipate the attacks and instead we end up with a lionising tribute to the President by all and sundry when to be honest, he reacted pretty much as you'd expect him to.I was amazed at the televisual access on the day to Bush in particular but also the Vice President Dick Cheney and other senior government officials, with it seems video or still photographic depictions of their almost every move in reaction to the chaotic events. There were some interesting reveals along the way, such as Condoleeza Rice's briefing of Russian President Putin or the mistaken belief that the President's jet Air Force One was itself under attack. While there was little room for the background stories of the slain or the heroism of the rescue services, there was the sad retelling of the death of the wife of the U. S. Attorney General who was actually on board one of the four planes used in the attacks, who the night before had left a touching birthday note on her husband's pillow as he slept.There possibly is a more critical programme to be made on how the events of 9/11 could conceivably have been prevented in the first place or the unforeseen consequences right up to the present day of Bush's self-justified gung-ho reaction to events but there was certainly never any chance that he was going to regret, at least on camera, any of his subsequent decisions. However, critical as I may be of him in other ways, I'm going to cut the man some slack on what was a cataclysmic day. As he says himself at the close, his ends justified the means as there have been no further atrocities carried out in mainland America since then.That said, he may yet live to rue those words if a Taliban-run Afghanistan does indeed become, as is now feared, a future breeding ground for American-targeted terrorist attacks in the future...",False
4,10,Insightful and Raw,calanwillard,n/a,16/08/2025,"For posterity, this film delves into the Executive Branch ""players"" so-to-speak i.e. President George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Colin powell, Mike Morrel, etc... in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and the decisions that were made at the time. In my opinion, each gave all that they had to give, in regards to why certain decisions were made, but - more importantly, they've allowed those decisions to be measured and weighed in light of what was catalogued, inventoried and collected afterwards, without excuse making.This film is a real look at the moment that truly changed a nation... from an unprecedented access... and a startling view from those that made the toughest decisions for our nation and the course with which we must steer and navigate today, both good -and- bad.",False
5,10,PLEASE RATE THE DOCUMENTARY not the people!!!,lindberghboy,n/a,16/08/2025,This is an amazing doc. It actually just seems to be a 2021 version of the 2011 documentary with the same people. That documentary was called 9/11:The day that changed America. It's nice to hear it from the bush administration at that time and from his words. I loved how seemless the scenes moved through.,False
6,6,A Gripping and Insightful Account of Unforgettable History,sufyaanrashid95,n/a,16/08/2025,"""9/11: Inside the President's War Room"" is an extraordinary documentary that chronicles the harrowing events of September 11, 2001, with a focus on the decision-making process within the highest echelons of power.

It presents a balanced perspective by featuring interviews with key figures, including President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and other members of the administration.What sets this documentary apart is its ability to humanize the individuals involved.

It serves as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by first responders and the bravery displayed by ordinary citizens in times of crisis.While the documentary does not shy away from the controversies and criticisms surrounding the response to the attacks, it refrains from passing judgment or engaging in political debate.

7,9,Unbiased and forthright recap,plau_chi,n/a,16/08/2025,"I appreciated this documentary not trying to inject a biased narrative. It lets people talk, it doesn't position anyone as heroes or villains, it just shows you the actions taken and when they happened. How you feel about any of it comes externally from the film.Too many documentaries on this topic have tried (rather transparently) to steer their audience towards a particular opinion or thought pattern politically. Refreshingly, there's no overt praise or overt admonishment of anyone in this. If one has problem with that, it's because they hoped for the film to service their bias in whatever regard, and I'm glad this film took the higher road.",False
8,7,Fantastic deep insight into the emotions that shaped history,bosvark-90388,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs with all Apple productions it is a pleasure to watch. The audience is transported chronologically into the events of the day from the viewpoint of the leaders. Due to this approach the film portray a very one-sided view and does not paint the whole picture, but still very informative with important lessons about leadership.",True
9,10,Fantastic!,mikeiskorn,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a brilliant documentary. Only bad thing was that it ended. The editing and flow was very smooth and really made you feel like you're reliving this terrible period in time all over again. Actually having president Bush take part in the documentary made it really come to life as we got to hear first hand what he was thinking and feeling at the time. A must watch.,False
10,6,"""This was a well organised attack to severely damage our country""",BrunoRatesTheMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,This really was a look inside the bunker. Turns out the TV and phone reception onboard Air Force One was spotty at best and the bunker under the White House was overwhelmingly out of date. They were expecting mission control from Independence Day and they got the bunker from Terminator 3. Interesting to see it all unfold from Bush's viewpoint.,False
11,10,"Heart wrenching, deeply disturbing but brilliant.",christaylorcoe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Truly a superb insight into the minds and words of the top echelons of the US government, including Bush. Chilling and disturbing and heart breaking. A brilliantly produced and a must see documentary.Trial by media gave Bush a hard time over his actions. Scrub previous conclusions. Let's not cast stones, I have nothing but respect for him and the US government now.",False
12,7,Chilling reminder but... lacking.,fulaingt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this, is different to the tv series just released about the same event. This seems to idolize Bush as someone in a hard position at the time. Not doubting he was, but he acted in a very different manner than you'd expect the president of a country under attack, to act. And the fact they had no clue as to who took down the united airline plane, till later?But, the footage from the event, still sends chills down my spine, and puts a tear in my eye. Shocking to know it was real. And I saw it live on TV as it was happening.Conspiracy theorists will no doubt take this in some way more evidence, I have no words on that matter.But yeah, 7 out of 10, because while it's an insight into things, it feels a bit bereft of everything... there is always more to a story, even after it has ended.",False
13,5,Memoir of a Mentally Challenged Cowboy,apteryx05-840-599163,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting re-telling of the 9/11 story, but it seemed to maintain that the decisions made by Bush and Cheney somehow justified their actions. In reality, their entire circle of war hawks were nothing more than a cabal of bumbling idiots whose ""war on terror"" spanned 20+ years and cost US$2.2 trillion dollars. Seems like that money could have provided health care for the entire country for more than 20 years. Go figure.",False
14,8,Put this docu in context,fajarsantoso,n/a,16/08/2025,"Apparently it is for all these bashers difficult to put this docu in the context of 2001 or from a preferred political party point of view. Dont look at it from a Rep. Lens or Dems lens but look at it through a 2001 lens.It is so easy (and a cheap shot) to judge those based on the knowledge we have today and if you do, well yeah you rate it probably below 4*.If you watch these docu througg a 2001 lens or perhaps, if you are a bit more sophisticated, through a political analyst lens, you might actually enjoy this doc.",False
15,10,"A portrait of resilience, tact, patience and leadership.",rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"In 2021, we will commemorate the 20th anniversary of the greatest American tragedies of the 21st century, the September 11 attacks. To help educate the public about exactly how this horrific event unfolded, the remarkably detailed documentary 9/11: Inside The President's War Room was created.Going minute by minute, hour by hour, 9/11: Inside The President's War Room offers two narratives, following the president's actions, thoughts, and movements, and the developing situation in New York City.President George W. Bush was interviewed for this film and his impeccable memory of the day and skilled delivery make the documentary even more unique. His impassioned vow to bring Al-Qaeda to justice, his struggle to keep his anger in check, and his helplessness as he was flown around the country to avoid a rumored attack on Air Force One show exactly how novel this crisis was. The film includes high-quality archival footage and the perspectives of individuals like Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Ted Olson, as well as the president and vice president's chief of staff. I've never seen a more thoroughly researched and impeccably pieced-together documentary. The many perspectives from all these individuals contribute to a strong narrative that captures you from minute one. Each interview is compelling and the editing cuts between medium shots of the individuals and archival footage, creating an immersive and truly ""in the room"" experience. The background music complements the film's somber tone.9/11: Inside The President's War Room is a portrait of resilience, tact, patience and leadership. There is some mild profanity in the film as well as some footage of the Twin Towers collapsing with screams in the background.I give 9/11: Inside The President's War Room 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. 9/11: Inside The President's War Room is available now on Apple TV+ . By Eshaan M., KIDSFIRST!",False
16,10,Riveting Look At That Momentous Day From A President-Focused Perspective,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"""9/11: Inside the President's War Room"" is actually a pretty simple documentary. It follows then-President George W. Bush from his morning jog in Florida to addressing the nation from the Oval Office later that night after the terrorist attack that felled the World Trade Center, damaged the Pentagon, and nearly targeted the White House were it not for the United Flight 93 passengers. This doc--under the direction of Adam Wishart--is utterly riveting in its simultaneous simplicity and complexity (as well as A-political nature).Basically, ""War Room"" tells the story of what President Bush did during the course of that entire day, from reading to a elementary school classroom in Florida to jet-setting across the country in Air Force One (trying to keep his cabinet safe and gather information) to finally ""coming home"" to D. C. and addressing the nation. There is a palpable sense of tension throughout this entire doc, in a very small way mirroring the events of the day in question. While easy to look back in hindsight and criticize actions, it is instructive to remember the unprecedented nature of the day's events and how major decisions were being made in real-time.I saw many photographs and video clips in ""War Room"" that I had never previously viewed--things like President Bush on Air Force One, Vice President Dick Cheney & Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in a secure bunker. Again, this all helped me gain perspective on just how fractured and difficult the decision-making process was on that day.""War Room"" is also the type of documentary that doesn't even sniff a political stance or personal ""take"" on the issues at hand. While such a ""just the facts, ma'am"" approach limits the scope of the piece quite a bit, there is also something refreshing about hearing the stories directly from the sources (Bush, Cheney, Rice, cabinet/advisors, etc.). Agree/disagree, like/dislike, but to me this doc painted--via the first-hand accounts and corresponding images--about as accurate of a picture as can be had of the President's timeline and actions that fateful day.9/11 is one of those events that will never be forgotten by those who lived through it. As such, there has been so much written/said/shown about every angle of that topic that it can be difficult to find something new or refreshing to cover. Fortunately, ""War Room"" worms its way into that niche by focusing on the President, his principal advisors, and a blow-by-blow description of the day's events. I was completely engaged from beginning to end and could have watched another hour and a half with ease. The narration of Jeff Daniels is also an enormous plus--his voice and composure is made for this sort of thing.",False
17,10,Never Forget.,prasannamr,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am from a country that had nothing to do with either the people who subscribed to an ideology of Jihad nor the people who were targeted. I have no family or friends who died or were affected by the events.But,I remember the morning of September 12th 2001, I was in my early teens. I had never seen a bolder headline in the newspaper than that, until that day.I asked my dad what happened, he replied to me ""America's arrogance is brought down"".I could not fathom those words. That image was engraved in my memory and I can never forget it.This is a very well done documentary about the visceral nature of the attack in step-by-step manner. I will probably never see a day of such horror in my life.I will always remember the people who were affected by it.",False

21,9,"Very interesting, though one-sided perspective.",petetete,n/a,16/08/2025,"A well-made documentary. What is interesting about it is that even 20 years later, the Bush administration continues to push the narrative that ""there was nothing in the security briefings"" about an impending attack. However, it was widely reported that Bush simply didn't read any of his security briefings. Under Clinton, the briefings were often 10 pages or more, he demanded details and would quiz the intelligence services. Bush simply took them and never read them. The briefings were shortened again and again, until they were a single page of bullet points. So yes, it is very unlikely one of those bullet points stated, ""impending attack using commercial flights"", but I can't help thinking the Clinton administration may have had a better chance of averting disaster with the type of intelligence the president demanded.Very well made film. Definitely worth a watch.",False
22,10,Memories etched into your mind forever,CLC16389,n/a,16/08/2025,"I find it completely and utterly incredulous how ignorant some people are these days as well as back in those days (ie. Top post as well as the rest of the negative reviews).I didn't really want to watch this documentary for the simple reason being, it's so incredibly painful to watch. Those horrifying memories etched into our minds forever, that play out like some incomprehensible horror movie stuck on replay for the rest of our lives. But alas, I ultimately decided to watch in hopes that it would be some sort of vindication for the President and his team and the decisions they had to make in such an unimaginable crisis.It was brilliantly curated, you absolutely feel the pain and suffering and many other emotions they all had to experience (like every single other American, they are human after all), while having to wrap their minds around the magnitude of what was unfolding before their eyes (when they had a television signal) and what they needed to do about it. I had a lot of respect for the President back then and even more for him now. I'm glad they finally got to tell their side of the story, they deserve to tell their story.I can 100% absolutely guarantee that the naysayers in here (those that would have ""done so much better had they been President"") AT THE TIME, fully appreciated the President's ""I'm going to kill you, without saying I'm going to kill you"" address to the nation after watching all that horror unfold.Their actions were completely justified, it's so very easy to throw stones after the fact. How easily people forget that tragic day, and that defining moment that changed our world forever.",False
23,10,Amazing,rmgaspar-49er,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is fantastic. Nevermind any political aspect, it's not the proposition. You simply feel as if you were with Bush and the other authorities during that day. All the things one wondered back then about how, now you see how they took place.It's about pictures, not videos. Intimate, amazing pictures. I never thought that level of revealing angle would ever surface. People who edited it will collect awards.Again, it is possible who want to know more about how those sad events were dealt with by authorities. This...is well documented forever. It is not about what is right or wrong.",False
24,8,Clear And Gripping,david-meldrum,n/a,16/08/2025,"A clear and gripping documentary that benefits from remarkable access to people and photos from that chaotic and frightening day.

25,2,This doucumentary disgusted me,Lovsmovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWorse documentary I seen and can't believe they release this.I don't like how Bush is smiling and smirking while giving his details of what happened. I mean 3k+ people died and all you can do is smile and crack jokes?Also at 54 mins in when they landed in La. And he was taken by mini van to headquarters, he told the.sergeant driving, I don't think there is any.al-qaedia on the base, when they even SAID they didn't know who did this. This just shows they knew of the incoming attacks and did nothing because little boy Bush wanted his war.",True

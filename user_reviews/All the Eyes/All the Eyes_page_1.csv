1,n/a,Gloaming,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Clearly this film (All the Eyes) is passionate about child poverty. I found the interviews with the children fascinating, as with the two teachers.When it started I thought it was going to be one of those films that feels like it is a lot longer than it actually is, but as soon as the interviews with the children started I was hooked. Such beautiful smiles, and despite their circumstances, they had that wonderful glow of children everywhere.And I don't think I have ever used the word 'gloaming' in my life, but I will now.Good art involves taking risks, and I feel that All the Eyes is good art.",False
2,n/a,Unseen children of Iran,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film goes to the children who live in poverty and no one pays attention to them. An honest film that is very friendly, without a selfish look from above, expresses the issues of Baloch children. Recklessly expressing their issues such as poverty, lack of birth certificate, lack of recreational facilities, discrimination against women and racism are the strong points of this film. This movie is suitable for people who want to know Balochistan and for academic people who want to know about the situation of the world community. I think that this film is one of the best documentaries made in Iran about poverty. A documentary film that engages both logic and emotion of the audience.",False

6,10,Great film! 10/10,EricaB-63,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is a heartfelt, authentic tribute to Filipino cuisine that left me deeply inspired and genuinely moved. From the very first scene, it was clear that this wasn't just a documentary about food-it was a story about heritage, resilience, and the way flavors carry memory and meaning. Filipino cuisine has long been underrepresented in mainstream culinary media, but this film gives it the spotlight it so richly deserves.What stood out most to me was the care and attention given to each story behind the dishes. The film doesn't just show the food-it tells the stories of the people who make it, the families that have kept these traditions alive, and the rich cultural tapestry that ties it all together. It's both educational and emotional, and it made me appreciate the deep roots and diversity within Filipino cooking.The visual storytelling was absolutely stunning. From the rich, golden hues of kare-kare simmering on a stovetop to the crisp crackle of freshly made lechon, the cinematography captured each dish with reverence. You could practically smell the garlic, vinegar, and spices wafting from the screen. Every restaurant and home kitchen featured in the film felt like a portal to a place of warmth, hospitality, and unshakable pride.Chris, the filmmaker, has a great take on making meaningful and visually compelling films. There's a distinct style to his work-thoughtful pacing, intimate interviews, and a clear passion for the subject matter. His direction allows each chef and storyteller to shine, while never overshadowing the food or the culture it represents. It's rare to see a documentary that balances artistic vision with such cultural sensitivity, but Chris achieves it masterfully. I can't wait to see what he creates next.What's more, this film didn't just entertain me-it motivated me. As soon as the credits rolled, I started making a list of the restaurants featured. I'm now inspired to make stops at each one to try the dishes for myself. It feels like a culinary pilgrimage, a way to engage more deeply with the cuisine and culture I saw on screen. There's something incredibly powerful about how this film turns viewers into participants, encouraging us to support these local businesses and taste these beloved dishes firsthand.The pacing of the film was also perfectly balanced. It gave enough time for each story to breathe without ever feeling slow. The transitions between locations were smooth, and the overall structure made the journey feel cohesive, like a lovingly curated tasting menu that builds in richness and complexity with every course.One of the most memorable aspects was how the film showcased the evolution of Filipino cuisine in the diaspora. It honored traditional methods while also celebrating innovation-chefs who are reinventing classics and blending influences without losing the soul of the food. It reminded me that culture isn't static; it grows, adapts, and finds new expression in each generation.In a world full of food documentaries, this one stands out for its sincerity, its beauty, and its heart. It's not just about what's on the plate-it's about the people behind it, the stories that shaped it, and the communities that keep it alive. Whether you're Filipino or not, this film speaks to the universal power of food to connect, comfort, and celebrate.In short, this film is a must-watch. It's informative, visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and culturally rich. I give it a wholehearted 10/10.",False

8,10,Philippino Soul Food,James-9365,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are lots of technical aspects to admire about this film. I'll leave that up to the other reviews to point out. I know this film is a bit of a diversion from the action packed ""Master and Commander"" and some of his more action packed Soriano projects. What I like most about this film is what I like best of the Soriano films and that's that I can sit down with my family and enjoy a great film with a great story and I won't have to worry about seeing anything embarrassing, gratuitous or perverse. Everyone is going to enjoy this film, you are going to get hungry and you are going to learn a little something about culture. In my book that's a near perfect recipe for a great presentation.",False

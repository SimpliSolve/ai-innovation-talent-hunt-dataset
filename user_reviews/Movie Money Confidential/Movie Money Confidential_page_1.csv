1,1,An HONEST Review!,anthonyender,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most of the filmmakers in this doco praise themselves as if they are players in the industry but check out their IMDB pages! And notice they are filming themselves talking to younger students who probably don't know better - it's a far cry from being guest lecturers at USC or NYU Film Departments. They managed to score a final interview with Burt Reynolds, which they pump for all it's worth, even though at the beginning of his interview he admits he knows nothing about movie financing nor has he ever gone that route himself! But it's all they've really got (besides some footage with Salma Hayek) so they have him dis the current state of movies (like a lot of older people do when - and not even intellectually tearing into things like digital vs film or streaming vs theaters).When you notice that these guys are all about trying to appear more famous than they are is it any surprise to see a flood of 10 ratings from accounts that only post reviews for this one film? The more people who tragically stumble on this film, the more low rated reviews it will receive.To be fair, you'll learn some interesting tid-bits at the beginning, but then the rest is a waste of time. If they're seriously looking into Blair Witch funding, why aren't there any interviews with the filmmakers?Come on guys, why wouldn't you just be honest and say ""we're near the bottom of the barrel but we got SOMETHING done, and this is what we learned!"" That kind of honest approach could be interesting, but what they've done reeks of a promotional video for a questionable Time-Share offering. As if they hope this will help them find someone to fund their other films. I couldn't finish it.",False
2,1,Really terrible,ydhyctkz,n/a,16/08/2025,The favorable reviews must be from people that were in this documentary. After the first few minutes I thought it actually might be a mockumentary. Calling this a movie is a stretch. Starring Selma Hayek? They lifted a Selma Hayek interview and cut it into this production. Pretty laughable.A good portion of this film is talking to random people who may or may not have ever actually been involved with a movie. Look them up on IMBD! This is in addition to about 45 minutes taking questions on panel interviews from high school students and other random people that showed up to a local restaurant.Lord knows how they managed to get an interview with Burt Reynolds. What a shame/sham!Please don't watch this...,False
3,4,"This movie made me curious, but crushed that feeling within 10 minutes",imseeg,n/a,16/08/2025,"My curiosity was raised when I read the description of this movie. Interesting. Never seen such a movie about this subject being made. Burt Reyolds starring in it? Yes, count me in! NOT.The bad: the only good thing was seeing Burt Reynolds being interviewed about the movie business. He has changed quite a bit, due to ageing, but he is still the man. But unfortunately even his surprising contribution didnt make this movie worth a watch. Why not?This is a TEDIOUS TALKING HEADS movie. NO ONE, has the answer on how to raise money for a movie, but EVERYONE has an opinion, some valid and interesting, most other opinions were open doors and water under the bridge.Not the interesting doc I imagined it would be. The opposite was true. Quite tedious and completely uneventful without any surprising insights whatsoever.",False
4,10,Ultimate Backstage Pass to Film Financing,smglrches,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc helped me enter deeper into the film financing process than ever before. I learned a lot from the featured producers and investors and took many notes from them. Movie Money Confidential is brilliant, inspirational, grounded, and practical. The production value impressed me too. Watch it now on streaming platforms like Vudu, Amazon Prime Video, PLEX, and Tubi, and see what a difference it will make in your worldview of filmmaking!You'll also want to pick up a copy of Louise Levison's book, Filmmakers and Financing Business Plans for Independents, which inspired Movie Money Confidential.",False
5,10,Not just for film makers!,itsqueenii,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just finished screening Movie Money Confidential! Hat's off to Rick Pamplin and the team. While I'm not in the film industry, I thought it was terrific.I lived in Orlando, FL, and attended the East Coast Premier of the Blair Witch Project at the Enzian Theatre, on the opening night of the 1999 Florida Film Festival. It was a thrilling surprise. Remarks, from Louise Levison, who shepherded the three young filmmakers through the business side of the process, were fascinating.I truly enjoyed getting this peak behind the scenes. The steps and strategies, laid out for those working to fund their independent film projects, are just as valuable to entrepreneurs and small business people, of all types, who aspire to launch their own new companies. The bright and eager young film students at the St Andrews School, together with their teacher, were especially inspiring. The input from Burt Reynolds and Salma Hayek was compelling.There is something here for everyone. If you are looking for something different, creative and captivating to add to your stream, Movie Money Confidential more than delivers.",False
6,10,Great film whether you're a movie maker or not!,colelev-68903,n/a,16/08/2025,"While this film gives great tips to the independent filmmaker, I'm also a fan of its interesting format and entertainment value. While, Rick himself is a fantastic interviewer, when you add, the average man on the street, A-list stars, and tongue-in-cheek humor by way of an infomercial, this movie is a must-see. I am interested in filmmaking, but my spouse isn't. We both watched and enjoyed it multiple times. Among other things it has motivated me to continue my work and never abandon my passion. The film goes beyond financing and touches on writing, pitching and more. I didn't just rent it, I purchased it. If anyone thinks they can't get their movie made they haven't seen Movie Money Confidential. I highly recommend it.",False
7,10,"Great film, important information",tld-73072,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rick and Maggie, the whole cast are magnificent. This is the conversation and information that all filmmakers need, but can't find. This is it! There's a load of insight for anyone with aspirations to make films.Louse Levinson is a great source with experience and knowledge like no one else.Scott DuPont is great as well.What this film does is bring the viewer into the conversation, the way it really is and what they can expect. I wish I had seen this before I made our film, it would have answered so many questions.The best part is that there's no one looking to get into your pocket, they're just trying to educate the viewer on the way it really works.",False
8,10,SO WELL DONE! I thoroughly enjoyed this!,wdbqgbp,n/a,16/08/2025,"People, don't listen to a negative review when you see 99% are positive. There is always a ""hater"" out there that wants to bring someone down when they do so well. It happens all the time in my industry also, especially when there is competition.This documentary was so well done and the information given is invaluable! Be sure to watch the entire credits as well and listen to what Burt Reynolds has to say in multiple parts during the credits. It is VERY CLEAR that Burt still knew what he was talking about. This is a very interesting documentary and there is very good reason why it is doing so well. Numbers speak volumes, read the reviews.",False
9,10,Rick Pamplin keeps soaring.....,dreamgrifter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rick, you've really outdone yourself this time! I was recently taking a trip and I saw your film as the top choice of available films in the plane. Amazing! I got to my hotel and sure enough, your film was on two of the platforms. You've hit gold this time!!This film will be a must-see in every film school across America for years to come. No wonder you're honored in the 9th edition of Louise Levison's book, FILMMAKERS AND FINANCING.Along with film legend Burt Reynolds in his last film ever, you bring hope and understanding to so many independent filmmakers who are unable to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Coupled with greats Salma Hayek, Scott duPont, Maggie Pamplin, and the esteemed Louise Levison, you pull back the curtain on many of the financing secrets and offer the filmmaker something to strive for.I will be looking for your future films and following your rise in the independent film world. It's always great to see Burt, what an honor it must have been to be so close with him.-Dan Griffin, Producer.",False
10,9,DANGER! This documentary is a fistful of dynamite!,TheReelCineManiac,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm blown away from this highly insightful movie. Exceeded my expectations. To see and hear Hollywood industrial-business secrets from cinematic legends was most compelling. I can't believe this documentary flew under my radar. Digital technological advancement has changed Hollywood's business model. Long gone are the days of yore like the nineties Kevin Smith success strategies. Movie Money Confidential gives the viewer a glimpse into viable steps to compete and succeed in todays market. It's an interesting and fun documentative exploration, into movie-making, for aspiring artists and casual observers. Confidential disclosure will terrify some and liberate others. BOOM!",False

1,9,"""If you scratch a cynic, you'll find a disappointed idealist",OnlyAtJMart,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great documentary! George Carlin was one of my favorite thinkers, and no one has or probably will replace him. He was great at pointing out hypocrisy, and putting things into perspective. I love that they incorporated things he talked about 30 years ago, that are still true today. Even more now than when he talked about them. This is an important documentary for anyone that is a fan, or has yet to see his work. I've been a fan most of my life, have seen all of his HBO specials, saw him perform live, twice, have seen a bunch of biographical specials about him, and own all of his books including Last Words which was released posthumously, and written by Tony Hendra (who worked with Carlin on it until his death). Even this documentary had things I didn't know. ...and those saying that this documentary is liberal propaganda, don't realize that his work always pointed out what the documentary covered. They probably didn't flinch when he pointed out the hypocrisy of some environmentalists, but can't get past his stance on pro-lifers, gun control, police brutality, racism, capitalism, and religion. It's the old double standard, ""I was enjoying when he was making fun of the things I don't like, but he went too far when he made fun of the things I stand behind."" This is a great documentary for George Carlin fans, and anyone with an open mind.",False
2,9,Great Carlin Tribute,billcr12,n/a,16/08/2025,"My favorite comedian is given a proper tribute by HBO, which made George Carlin a household name. Jon Stewart compared him with Bach and Beethoven, a completely accurate assessment. Stephen Colbert calls him the Beatles of comedy, and again, a perfect comparison. The early to late clips show an artist evolving from a safe performer to a no holds barred angry old man with a message. We have no one out there now with Carlin's balls. Oh boy do I miss him now. Watch this great film.",False
3,9,Long in depth bio doc of a comedy go against the grain legend.,blanbrn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Always was a George Carlin fan loved his ""HBO"" specials, and listened to his C. D.'s, and even went to Vegas once to see one of his stand up acts. George was down right funny as his comedy attacked authority and challenged the yes men, and this ""HBO"" two part doc special ""George Carlin's American Dream"" was long, in depth and informative looking at his whole life and work with vintage footage, interviews with family(including daughter Kelly and first late wife Brenda) and friends as other now famous comedians really admired Carlin as his work rubbed off on them. Shown was his early humble start in New York in which his father left, and how he went away to service, and started out in radio by telling jokes, then it was on to his duo acts and variety shows, yet this really didn't fit George's image.Now try a new Carlin with long hair and a beard would helped change his comic style as the jokes got tougher as they challenged culture and society, and his biggest funs was in front of college crowds, and doing stand up specials as his clubs days took a pause due to censorship. However with fame and money came the battle of addiction still George became a comedy legend for his blunt, brash, go against the grain tell it like it is style as Carlin felt all in society was diseased! It was more than the seven dirty words that you can't say on television with this man, as George became a PHD on word use and a friend to many, this doc was fun, revealing, and informative, a must watch for any Carlin fan and a must for any historical comedy buff.",False
4,10,Critical thinking a must,JK404,n/a,16/08/2025,It appears that some people didn't watch this in it's entirety. Those who are wrapped up in the political and religion jokes are the ones who George Carlin wanted to offended the most. Mission accomplished. But this was such a great look at his entire career and hearing other comedians perspective on the bits being told and how Carlin evolved as an artist.,False
5,10,George is the Einstein of American Comedy,mhorg2018,n/a,16/08/2025,"George is my favorite comedian of all time. He left us far too soon, because we need his insight today possibly more than ever. George wasn't just funny, he was intelligently funny and he made PEOPLE THINK. I'd trade Heard, Depp, Cyrus and so many more to have him back for one final show to talk about today.",False
6,10,Loved it,dkastava,n/a,16/08/2025,Really great show! Sad that some people only see it politically. It was really an American history lesson. I grew up watching Carlin and I see the dedication behind his work.,False
7,10,Iconic,norascarbalis,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was nice to walk through the decades with Carlin, Brenda and Kelly. Its beautiful to see the ""cynical/realist"" have a life off the stage. The archival footage is amazing and crisp. The personal recordings, voicemails and letters put a personal touch on this documentary I think George himself would've approved of.",False
8,10,Worthwhile viewing for several original archival sets from George Carlin.,calsonassociates,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is one of those documentaries where emotionally the need to write may strike you as well. Several points of interest were noted that generally are touched upon by George Carlin or family and friends interviewed that has been seen before. He does believe in the development of mankind in the last four thousand years as being truly awe-inspiring through his logical progressive levels in personal changes incrementally shown with his public performances. The peak levels of comedic intellectual reasoning skills as an orator solves many difficulties and riddles for the common man. While joking about the individual the broader picture embraces a dark element several colleagues do not necessarily follow. In knowing why 'life is worth losing' a special in 2005 George Carlin expresses his pride in how mankind the bombs and the almighty machines act as a cover-up to a human bankruptcy boasting on stage the power of the human and his knack for hiding human impotence. In the totality of circumstances, his humor rose heads above shoulders of all who were interviewed and settles his name as a pillar of foundation for the comedy historians and powers-that-be in a global media civil society. THANK YOU KINDLY GEORGE CARLIN!",True
9,10,Still Relevant Today,jeffinjr,n/a,16/08/2025,Great documentary a great look at one of the best in the comedy world and how he was off stage. Nobody did it better than carlin and probably never will.,False
10,7,George Carlin - Mort Sahl - Bill Hicks,MortSahlFan,n/a,16/08/2025,"And sorta ended there... The Loyal Opposition. Now, we have nothing but groups. George Carlin was a social/political satirist in the tradition of Mort Sahl, who started it all.. Taking a humorous approach and using your skills to carefully examine the country in a literate way, on the diagnosis and to surprise the audience using irony, sarcasm, etc.. We really are living in an Orwellian period, because the terms ""right"" and ""left"" have no meaning, just like the many other redundant terms people use simply because it's trending. There's no left-wing in the US, and really hasn't been since the 1930s, but we still had artistic dissidents. Not anymore. Now they are bought off for so cheap to be salesmen (excuse me, salesPEOPLE - where people from ALL groups can be liars) and peddle whatever business USA Inc. Wants.. Carlin spent most of his time talking about political correctness and the damage it does by placating energies with symbolic nothing or promises.. As Ralph Nader said so wisely, ""What do you win when you win?"" but the conformity is so much now, that you can spot someone's one-party baloney from a mile away.YouTube has the first time Carlin was on TV.. In fact, he was on ""The Tonight Show"" with Mort Sahl as host (they went with Johnny Carson) in 1962 and there were some great shows, including one that had a panel of women, discussing the modern woman, and the things they liked/disliked about men.I urge people to check out the archives to get the full story of George Carlin. They conveniently leave certain things out, make cuts right before he's about to say he admired Castro (thanks to Jack Burns; it's in his book by Tony Hendra), but remember who's names are on the credits...If you really want truth, go directly to the source -- George Carlin. It's all on YouTube, but unless it's packaged into a commodity, people will pass on an actual Carlin interview, but spend that time listening to a 3rd hand account, only because it's someone who is the flavor of the month in May of 2022.",False
11,10,Portrait Of A Comedy Legend,MrskiViletic,n/a,16/08/2025,"This two part documentary chronicles the life, comedy and turbuletions of the one and only George Carlin in his life long quest to finding and making his voice heard. With interviews with his family and close friends as well as a number of comedians who were influenced heavely by his work, this documentary portrays the comedy legend in all of his ups and downs in his personal as well as his professional life in an entertaining and enlightening way. It seems that even years after his death his views and takes on society are still fresh snd poignant as ever, and this is brilliantly showed in the documentary. A must watch!",False
12,7,A Good Look at George Carlin's Life,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love George Carlin add 1/2 a star. This is another Judd Apatow, in depth, comedic documentary. I don't like this as much as the one on Larry Sanders, but it is good. A look at the life of George Carlin through clips, footage, interviews, and articles. Like many of today's documentaries it is too long. This would have been better served to be one 2 hour documentary instead of 2 episodes. This one is funny, but it is also a little sad. I loved George Carlin. His use of words and language was the most unique and intellectual comedy of all time. Only Dave Chappelle has ever matched this comedy style. I am glad I watched this one.",False
13,n/a,Well done bio doc on a master of comedy,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"""It's called the American dream because you need to be asleep to believe it."" - George Carlin.One thing that Carlin could never be accused of is sleepwalking his way through his career. From his beginnings as a stand up in the early 60s through his passing in 2008, Carlin seemed to be in a perpetual state of re-invention. He also became a true comic legend.He started out as a traditional suit and tie comic, became the comedic voice of the stoner generation, morphed into a sort of younger version of Andy Rooney with his wry observations on ""things"" and ""stuff"", tried his hand at mainstream acting and then finally, as an angry old man shouting at the world. In between, he had several bouts with being tabbed as: washed up. Indeed, one of the most striking interviews here is with Bill Burr who admits that he and his buddies once went to a Carlin concert with the expressed intent to heckle and belittle him. Burr, came out impressed.For the most part Directors Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio make good use of the four hours they spend recapping Carlin's career. The clips and interviews focus on both his public and private lives, and , to their credit, they pull no punches. The personal life that Carlin lead was full of drugs and a long complicated, but loving marriage to Brenda Carlin. His daughter Kelly gives the viewer a detailed perspective - which is both affectionate and brutally honest. Carlin's second wife Sally Wade assures the viewer that even when the comedian seemed his most bitter on stage late in his career (one of his specials was entitled ""Life is Worth Losing"") he was still warm at home and one on one with the public.As with most Apatow productions, there is some padding and it strains a bit too much to make Carlin's work relevant today is awkward at times. Let Carlin's own words make the case - and they do. The ""American Dream"" may have been an illusion to George Carlin - but, he illuminated his vision of it very clearly. And, damned was he funny - and, yes, still relevant.",False
14,5,Disappointed,btcrooks,n/a,16/08/2025,I was really enjoying the story of George's life until the last 15 minutes where they decided to add in current politics. Very disappointed they felt the producers felt the need to sour what could have been great.,False
15,10,What a genius.,mulesstuff,n/a,16/08/2025,"Best biography I've ever seen. The format, editing, content and casting are perfect. The family's involvement was really great. Well worth the watch. If you are a fan it's a must.",False
16,10,A well-researched tribute to a comedy legend,sam-1668,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPreface: I discovered George Carlin's ""Jammin' in NY"" on VHS in middle school. My friends and I watched him religiously; memorizing his routines. I still quote him in my daily life, having sampled and referenced his works on probably dozens of songs as a musician.I'm a huge fan of Judd's films and books. His Garry Shandling doc was incredible, too. So when he announced this film, a doc about my absolute hero, I was elated.The opening five minutes are tremendously exciting. I knew that it was made by people who truly got what George was about. Every era is represented, and for the most part, quite thoroughly. Many clips of his standup are presented without interruption.The film opts for quality over quantity. I expected a plethora of comedians, but here we get the best voices working today: Chris Rock, Bill Burr, and Jerry Seinfeld. Frequent collaborator Kevin Smith also provides some valuable background on George's personal life.After nearly four hours, it left me wanting more. I would've loved to see ""Euhemisms"" and ""The 10 Commandments"" represented, and the timely commentary of his Parental Advisory album cover.Additionally, this was released 20 years and two days after the Complaints & Grievances album. Being one of his finest works, it's the only HBO special that was completely ignored. There was a brief mention of the original title, I Kinda Like it When a Lotta People Die-and what an amazing story to omit-but the content itself is not found. (For the backstory, listen to my interview on the Take 92 Podcast with Complaints & Grievances artist, Winston Smith.)In the end, this film offers a closer look at the reasons for what he does. I was compelled by the timing of Brenda's death in relation to You Are All Diseased. It was that deep hurt that led to his most epic bits on religion. And it may have been the reason that he closed his heart to such an extent on his last two specials.* He was protecting himself. (*Note: I do not endorse the opinion that his last two specials were ""too dark"" or any less brilliant.)The film shows someone who was deeply empathetic and also quite sensitive, using his stage persona to make sense of the world around him. George was dedicated to a fault, and sacrificed his most important relationships to become the fearless performer we all loved. His pursuit of the craft remains unparalleled by anyone in his field.I miss George dearly and regret that I never got to meet him. I'll watch this documentary countless times, like so many of his specials. This is a gift to the fans. Thank you to Judd, Michael, and HBO. Joe bless GC.",True
17,10,A+ Documentary,antonioxperez,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was really eye opening into the life of George Carlin. It did not shy away from his dark side and make him out to be a hero but was pretty objective. George lived such an interesting life.On another note: Shame on Jerry Seinfeld for saying that he wouldn't change peoples minds. Providing information is the only way to change a mind, Jerry.",False
18,10,I was so lucky,nash4,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm 65. As a kid, my family was moved all over the country because of my dad's job. The most difficult move was across the country from IL (where all my extended family was) to OR. I was 11, very sad and very lonely.George Carlin was on the Flip Wilson show. I say I was lucky because I had a mom and dad who may have been trying to appease their daughter and allowed her to buy George's Class Clown record. Yes, an LP playing on the record player complete with the swearing, something my parents never allowed. Yet, there I was with gold in my hands.I can't count how many times I saw George in person, then later in life, along with my husband who also found him hilarious.One day, as an adult, back in the Chicago area, I was flipping through the Chicago Tribune. George had written a book and there it was ""George Carlin coming to Chicago for book signing."" We went to the event and in walked George. I have photos, met him, talked to him.The woman standing by the table said if I wanted to contact this wonderful comic, I could email the publisher. Try to stop me.I emailed, received a response, an 8x10 autographed glossy and some of the best memories of my life.For me, this show was a must see. To learn even more about this wonderful man than I already knew was amazing. To feel the love he had for his Brenda, his daughter, his second wife and his pets. To see him with dogs and talking to them as we talk to ours so made us love him even more.No matter how I felt, I loved it, there would never be less than a perfect rating from us.He meant so much to me and my husband and grown sons know it. I was working the day he died and had to call my family. I had to. The grief leveled me as if he were close family.Thank you for this documentary and I thank George Carlin so much for changing my life. 10+ stars.We were so  lucky.",False
19,10,Having a dream,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"We barely get to know who we are - as a human being or whatever we identify with. So apart from being able to go back in time and get inside the head of George ... this seems to be as close as we get to understand and to comprehend who he was ... and what he became.A comedy/standup icon that is of course, but we can watch the stand up specials. We can see the youtube video clips of him performing. We can share his ideas on many things that are still topical - right now about abortions for example. And if you think he made a political statement, just because it does not align with your view ... well he made a lot of statements and while I agree with most, I do not think that I would repeat everything (his view on global warming was at least at some point far away from what scientists believe to be true).That being said, he always fought those in power. That it was more the Republicans did not make him a Democrat. He actually hated the idea that you had 30+ flavors of ice cream but only 2 political parties. And yes you could argue that independents are able to run for President. But let's keep it real: they don't have a chance (yet).Before I keep ranting on about stuff that is insignificant in the overall picture, let me emphasize that this two part special is as great as it gets, because it does not only show the good side of Carlin. Or rather it shows us that he had issues as well. As great as he was on stage, he had to fight demons as well. He had to find himself ... he had to find the balance between work and love life. But judging from how his daughter behaves and has grown up, he did a lot of things right.No one is perfect and as Ricky Gervais has said recently, it is not the words that are spoken that are to be blamed, but the context. Something Carlin worked hard for - to make the distinction. He even got arrested for using profanity on stage. A funny yet illuminating story. As is the documentary overall - showing the influence he had on so many people. And not half of them can be seen here - there just is not time enough. Also they were able to find a lot of (audio) material from Carlin himself ... and what better way to enjoy this, than hear from the Legend himself? Exactly.",False
20,9,"I loved it, except for one small critique.",fearthemcneil,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hearing George's story from his family and friends was phenomenal. I could have used more time and insight from them though. Having some folks like Stephen Colbert, W. Kamau Bell and Hassan Minaj there just felt like wasted time however. I can appreciate that they want to speak on how he influenced them and how they interpreted his ideas but I wanted more Alex Winter, Chris Rock, Kevin Smith and more John Stewart. You know, people that actually knew the man and spent significant time with him. That would be my only small gripe in an otherwise fantastic viewing experience. We miss you George, you were so far ahead of the game it's scary. Hope you're having fun laughing at us out there somewhere.",False
21,6,ZZZZZZZ... meh,Jimmc2990,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not exactly riveting.Interesting back story on Carlin & his genesis, but really a snooze fest overall.

22,10,Was George Carlin a prophet...,prose52,n/a,16/08/2025,"First let me say, I'm in Australia and it is in two parts as far as I can tell.George Carlin. Was he a seer of the future or just the common sense that so many are missing? His words are remarkable to me because almost everything he said has come to pass. Isn't that amazing?I am happy to say I saw him perform when I lived in Chicago. Carlin performed at The Mill Run Playhouse in Niles, Illinois. He was amazing, eye opening and enlightening. I wonder what he would say or do if he were alive when Obama was elected. Or when FG questioned if Obama was born in the United States. I can only imagine, hopefully, what Mr Carlin would have had to say about FG!I think everyone should watch and listen to this program. Personally I find it inspiring, and motivating. The world is a better place because of George Carlin. We could sure use his wise words today.",False
23,9,Thoroughly Enjoyed it. Except for this ....,levybob,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed 'George Carlin American Dream'. With the one exception.The time chronology.I found - rightly or wrongly - that the film kept bouncing back and forth between the 1980s and late 1990s without regard for the viewer's understanding. A fact or opinion was stated, we saw a supporting photo or clip of Carlin, and based on his appearance it was clear in what era the photo/clip was made. But the supported statement had referred to another - earlier or later - era entirely. And the longer the film went, and the further into his life we went, instances such as these became more the rule than the exception. Which, of course, is a pity.Nevertheless I recommend that you see it.",False
24,8,"Carlin: ""I said along time ago....""",atprick,n/a,16/08/2025,"""When fascism comes to America it won't wear jack-boots and brown shirts. It'll have on a smiley face, T-shirts, designer jeans and nikes.""Carlin....",False
25,9,"yes, everything is okay, anyway",LazyCatCutCoins,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is a phenomenon I have noticed in which a person, when prompted, will claim to be familiar with the works of a great artist, actor, director, author, et cetera, when they are actually are not familiar with their works at all.For example, a person that has never seen the movie Pulp Fiction (god forbid) is asked to ""Remember when Christopher Walken talks about hiding a watch inside his ass for many years?"", and despite the fact they have no idea what that means, they say something along the line of, ""Yeah, that was hilarious!"", before quickly changing the subject to anything else in the world.I freely admit that I myself have displayed this bizarre psychological behavior at times in my life. I have also come to believe that there are several reasons that a person might do this. Some of which might be that they're trying to end a potentially boring conversation before it even begins, perhaps they feel that if they admit they're not familiar with a particular subject they may be viewed as one ""not in-the-know"", or maybe they are simply in the habit of lying about little things from day to day, and for no particular reason.I would now like to apply this phenomenon to the late and great, George Carlin.If you had asked me ten years ago if I was a fan of George Carlin, I might have answered, ""Yes, of course!"", knowing that he was a brilliant and influential artist, yet almost nothing else about the man. Then of course I would change the subject as quickly as possible.If I asked the same question to you right now, what might be your answer? And regardless of what that answer might be, if I followed up with, ""What's your favorite Carlin bit?"" and you had no answer, then I have a suggestion for you.I believe that George Carlin's American Dream, if watched in its entirety, will leave very few gaps in all you need to know about this brilliant, kind, angry, lovable, off-the-charts genius, borderline prophetic critic of American culture and the human species as a whole.I'm not sitting here writing this all day long simply to kill what precious time I have left on earth. I'm writing this because I really hope you take me as sincere, and further take the time and effort to check this documentary out. And that if you do, you find the best possible outcome to this effort; that you will learn so much more about life, people, history, politics, faith, religion, hypocrisy, love, death, DRUGS, and the human potential to express itself clearly and without fear, than you will the solitary story of a great man's life and his body of work.If you take me up on this challenge, and by the end can honestly claim that you truly have no idea what I'm going on about, I'll refund your money.No, I do not have a favorite Carlin bit. I have 317. I'll leave you with one I'm finding apropos for the pickle we've found ourselves in today.""Do you find it mildly ironic that most of the people that are against abortion are people you wouldn't want to f#ck in the first place?""George Carlin, GOAT.",False

1,10,This is history,SteverB,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's unfortunate that there are still people that deny that January 6th has the meaning that most normal, everyday Americans feel it has. It was an attack on our democracy from a hoard of people that thought where we all live is only THEIR country. It's not, nor will it ever be.The documentary is made by the same filmmakers that brought us ""9/11."" The two French documentarians that are the only ones who recorded the first plane that went into the World Trade Center. They continued filming that day at the risk of their own lives and produced a film record that is still played on 9/11 anniversaries because it is so powerful. This film is as powerful. I don't believe they were there on January 6th to film anything, but the pieces of footage they've assembled into a coherent narrative is the only one I've seen that shows the SCOPE of what happened. There were many shots and clips that I had never seen, and I thought I'd seen them all. In addition, there were several shots that showed the actual SIZE of the crowd of rioters, and I no longer have any doubt that the people that were the subjects of the attack suffer from PTSD to this day. It frightened me a little on a TV screen. I can't even begin to imagine what it would have been like to have actually been in the middle of it.I agree with other reviewers that say this should be shown in schools. It is educational and never boring. I would imagine students would find this film riveting.People calling this biased or leftist or whatever other distractions they try to smarm into readers of their reviews are trying to make people turn away from this because it makes anyone that supports it look awfully bad.The thing that struck me most were the continued chants of ""USA! USA! USA!"" while they stormed the seat of our government, as if to say that what they were doing was somehow a representation of the USA. It was only that representation to people who are dissatisfied with their government, or frankly, their own lives, and don't know how to express themselves like a citizen in a society. We STILL have a democracy despite their crass and loathsome behavior, and we don't express dissatisfaction with the government by attacking it. We vote. And they knew that before they did what they did. The insurrectionists that are still in jail were not even mentioned in this piece. And that is appropriate -- they, after all, knew what they signed up for.A very solid 10 for me.",False
2,10,Witness the denial in the reviews,rhb-51699,n/a,15/08/2025,"The only thing more disturbing than the disgraceful behavior of the bigots and criminals who shamed our country on that day is the willful ignorance, denial and absurdity of those who still insist there's nothing to see here.We are truly living in bizarre times when this amount of direct, firsthand evidence is STILL not enough for those who wish to believe in an alternative reality. Watching this footage, one can only marvel at the mental gymnastics and cognitive dissonance required to twist this into ""fake news"" or ""it's Pelosis fault"". In decades to come our descendants will be appalled. One can only hope they at least find some wry humor in the ridiculousness of self-proclaimed ""patriots"" violently attacking the US Capitol.",False
3,1,Terribly disappointing,EddieSixx,n/a,15/08/2025,"There was a chance here for filmmakers to present to people like me (a non-American) an unbiased and informative piece of information that I could learn from. Instead, I get a Democrat Party propaganda film. Some people are saying this should be shown in schools? America, you have lost your way. You are so divided into teams you have lost your minds and think this is a documentary. It isn't. In one of the first segments, the black filmmaker states that he stands out because of his colour. In almost the very next shot of the crowd, we see faces of all backgrounds of ethnicities. It was all downhill from there. Total trash.",False
4,10,Go read the other reviews that people who gave this 1 star wrote.,gregorymilesharris,n/a,15/08/2025,"Seriously. It's the most cliche group of people (I'd bet the farm on calling them election deniers). I'd also wager they made it past highschool but are now holding a PhD in political science. You know the people I'm talking about. They probably have a shirt that says ""We the people"" but don't know the lines that follow that. You know, the ones who will get all up in arms about the 2nd amendment, but couldn't tell you what the 9th amendment is. I hope one of them reads this review and takes a good long look in the mirror before sitting down to watch this movie.Anyway. This is an interesting movie about an infamous day. It's definitely worth the watch.",False
5,10,"Seriously, watch this.",brennamagdalena,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a harrowing, yet fantastic watch. I've watched many Jan 6th ""documentaries"" and they would play the same tired clips we've all seen over and over again. Jan 6th though, had never before seen footage and interviews from both unbiased Republican and Democrats who were inside the Capitol that day. This isn't ""fake media"", or Antifa. The footage doesn't lie. It's astonishing that there are people who use mental gymnastics to defend this.Halfway through I thought they should definitely show this to older middle/highschool history class students. My son is only 10 but when he gets a couple years older, I absolutely will.",False
6,10,Riveting,speizer-59517,n/a,15/08/2025,"Excellent documentary chronicling the events of January 6. The use of personal interviews provides a compelling narrative of the intensity of the day. No documentary can do justice to describing the heroics of the capitol police or our congressional representatives or those standing up to the insurrection, but this documentary does a good job at pulling this together. The filmmakers did a fantastic job following the insurrectionists to help put the events of the day in a chronological order to provide a compelling historical perspective. This documentary is highly recommended for anyone interested in appreciating the events of this infamous day.",False
7,10,Essential viewing,TheFilmographer,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hard, but essential viewing. Ignore the ratings of the fascist bots. A modern history of political zombies whipped into a moronic frenzy by the Idiot in Chief, who, to this day, is astoundingly still not in jail. It is a miracle this did not end up in a bloodbath, like it so very nearly could have.Show it in schools.Hard, but essential viewing. Ignore the ratings of the fascist bots.

8,1,One sided,neyhilton,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMountain out of a Mill Hill. Did you know that in truth these people didn't storm anything. The doors where unlocked. This is so biased and one sided it's unbelievable. And as always to add to the drama there is always one cop who went to work early that day or a secret agent who took his gun with him to work that day or that secretary who had a bad feeling that day before anything even kicked off. As for trump it was nothing more then a presidential speech. Yet they made him out to
be this mob leading thug. They had a good opportunity here to make a good both sided
Documentary about this. That didn't happen. 1 star.",True
9,8,Dry retelling of a Terrible time,vulcon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Good effort in telling the story of this day by those involved, and stock footage.You only have to look at the way people voted on IMDB to see how extreme the differing views are. That so many believe theories and questionable facts, when reality is staring them in the face is perhaps the worst part.A reasonable, even good, documentary of that terrible day. The complete and utter failure on so many levels should frighten anyone who sees the peaceful transfer of power as being a norm of democracies. I can forgive people who were angry, even those who were violent, they were fooled by those who knew the facts, and didn't care, using them for callous political advantage.Even after this terrible time, 147 Republicans representative failed to do their constitutional duty, and certify the election later that same day. Where is the shame?",False
10,10,Excellent summary of the most shameful day in America,zinitime,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an excellent documentary of what happened on January 6th, the most shameful day in American history! As I watch, I can feel my anger rising, again. I am still outraged that my fellow Americans allowed themselves to fall for all the lies Trump, and FOX NEWS, had been spewing for over 3 years. And then, they actually took arms and attacked our Capitol Building at Trump's bidding! MY Capital Building! MY country!As I hear them yelling ""treason"" I wonder if they even realize that THEY were committing treason at that very moment! I am going to watch this video each year to remind myself just how close we came to losing our country to Donald Trump, the worst president to ever hold the office.May God continue to bless America, and save us from Trump, and his followers.",False
11,10,for me...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a grumpy old bystander, who knows a little bit about u.s politics from my high school years, and i bet that i know more than 90% of the u.s population about political usa, than u.s citizens knows about my own country , norway, a land of peace and beauty where the king still may take his walking stick for a stroll down the main street of the capital, and where the police just have been allowed to carry weapons as part of their uniform... it seems so ludicrous that its the french naudet-brothers that hands over this panzerblasting documentary about the capitol siege... just like they documented the socalled conspiratious event called '' 9/11'' with sequels, a film i usually view every fall just to remember what its all about...the naudets do such a grave job that everything after this would be kindergarten stuff of highly partisan conspiracy stuff, that noone at either side would like nor hate vice versa...so if you are in for a buffet of french documentary brilliance with codus on insight and objectivity, then this is my recommend, i know that 50% of the u.s population disagrees, but that is why we have political observers around the world.",False
12,10,Brilliant Documentary,ActinAlex,n/a,15/08/2025,"Filmmakers were on the ground with the rioting mob that day risking their own life and safety to document history. As a result we watch up close the Capitol Police and the DC Police being beaten and pushed and overwhelmingly outnumbered for hours to protect the seat of US government and its elected members (knowing that if they used their weapons it would be catastrophic to hundreds). Their brave, selfless, savvy and exhausting performance to do their jobs against all odds is brilliantly captured in this film. They are every-day men and women who became American heroes who saved lives and protected the foundation of our democracy. We see first hand the human and institutional damage caused by the angry mob (both inside and outside of the US Capitol) and its intent to stop the democratic Constitutional process of the peaceful transfer of power of a US Presidency. The filmmakers continually use a model of the Capitol, as well as a time stamp, to show the viewer the different entries that were breached and how close the mob was to the elected officials throughout the day. One comes away with even more dismay at how this could go on for hours, 3.5 miles from the Pentagon and.15 blocks from White House, without any intervention and assistance from the President and the military.",False
13,1,Propaganda at it's finest and worst,torontofan1,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a Canadian and wanting to learn more i watched this to see if there was anything the fake news didn't cover. What a complete pile of manure. One of the worst and most one sided biased documentaries i have ever seen in my life, and i've seen a lot. The 10 ratings are either related to or friends of the documentary maker, or are brainwashed leftist cult members. Thiss documentary doesn't talk about Ashley Babbit who was unarmed and murdered, or how the protesters were let into the building. The United States likes to talk about democracy and freedom, yet there are protesters still in jail 2 years later without being charged, nice going leftist Communists.",False
14,2,Missed opportunity for truth,joeyford-55342,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was hoping this would be an interesting and deep look at what actually happened on 6th January.it did not age well as almost 2 years from The movie coming out we now know that many things were not discussed like the 40000 hours of video that Nancy Pelosi hid from the public because it shows her complicity in the actions that took place on 6th January. We now know there were somewhere between 30 and a 100 FBI agents in the crowd edging them on and guiding them to the doors of the capital building that were being held open by security guards period we do know for a fact that there were 4 deaths that day, 3 being outside the actual capital and one being an unarmed female veteran who was murdered by a security guard period the 3 people who were murdered outside the capital were bystanders, 2 of them just having a conversation Period it's only a matter of time before all of the facts come out and movies like this that were put out by the dnc are a bad joke.",False
15,1,FAKER then fake,nimstone,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jan 6 was a false flag setup, There is hours and hours of footage, they wont show you, of officers shooting rubber bullets and tear gas into the crowd to get them rilled up and dont get me started on the fbi agents imbedded in the crowd, remember the agent being questioned by congress? She could not confirm or deny if there was agents in the crowd, that means there was. There is footage of agents being uncuffed by capital police and fist bumping each other for a job well done.Jan 6th was NO insurrection in the slightest, it was merely a peaceful riot, which pelosi and fellow dem and rinos let happen. At least it was more peaceful then the summer of 2020. Just a couple days before they turned down help from Trump in the way of the National Guard.Please watch this docu with an open mind as I did, the paid actors are hypocrites and constantly LIE. That's my 2 cents.",False
16,1,Absolutely False,kristikelley-59789,n/a,15/08/2025,"Now in 2025 the truth about January 6 will finally be told! It was absolutely a set up by Nancy Pelosi and the EVIL demon rats! The capitol police were letting people in and standing around and letting everyone come in and once they were all in, they started shouting insurrection! Our government is a complete joke! Now that we have a President that loves America the people responsible for this are going to jail! It is amazing to me that there are so many people that cannot see the truth! The deep state that is destroying our country hates all of us and some people just let them use the. In their evil plot! I pray that God opens they eyes of the people that believe this was an insurrection by President Trump!!",False

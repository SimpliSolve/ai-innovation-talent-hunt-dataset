1,8,Better than what I expected,MattKesz,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're interested in Celtics history (or league's history in general), it's a good series to watch. I'm looking forward to the next episodes. There aren't that many great documentaries about the NBA and I hope this one becomes one of them.The first episodes will focus on Russell and 60s team (and deservedly so) so I think it's not interesting for everybody
But as long as it remains historically accurate and have some new informations It's good with me.If you're interested you can give it a chance, don't pay attention to these Fakers fans who thought it's their duty to write a bad review :)",False
2,9,I'm all in!,celticsfan-72909,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not only am I all in, but my 8 year old son is interested as well. He's a Jason Tatum fan, but now he understands the history of the Celtics, and why I'm such a fan of the Larry Bird era, (I was born in '73.)To me, this documentary is very well done, and very insightful, packed with things I either didn't know, had forgotten, or was just misinformed about over the years, but appreciative of nonetheless.Red Auerbach to me is the greatest GM of any pro sport ever! The man was a visionary, and I truly believed he cared about all his players, and their families, regardless of color. Rest in peace.I'm sorry that Bill Russell and all black athletes had and have to deal with bigotry, those people don't speak for all of us, but they taint a great city unfortunately.I had forgotten what happened to Dee Brown(another favorite player of mine) at the bank) that burned me up!Reliving the Len Bias and Reggie Lewis times era still seem raw sadly. What could have been.I look forward to each episode; they're so well done, and I don't want the series to end!PS, Chief, you don't give yourself enough credit. You're loved by Boston, trust!Go Celts!",False
3,10,Celtic Pride,superman4017-712-680039,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a great first episode setting up a wonderful re-telling of the history of the Greatest NBA Franchise of All-Time. Well edited and very well told. This series is gonna be very bittersweet as it will dig through racial issues of the earlier days in this great franchise but will also tell the truth without a biased filter while showing the unparalleled dominance this franchise has experienced on the court throughout the years. So incredibly happy that I will get to share this with my kids when they get a bit older to help them truly understand why their Dad loves this team and this city. Also looking forward to learning more behind the scenes stories of my favorite players that I grew up watching and others that I've only seen immortalized on old game tape. Forget ""Showtime"" it's ALL ABOUT CELTICS CITY!",False
4,10,For all the fans of the Last Dance,tkearney-59419,n/a,16/08/2025,I believe this has the same production crew as the Netflix Last Dance series. While we have limited new content so far in the first two episodes we are talking about the beginning of the Celtics which was so long ago most players aren't around to speak about those early years. That doesn't mean they should be skipped over.While this entry is not as good as Last Dance for broad appeal. It does have plenty of content and history pertaining to the Celtics and the NBA as a whole. Looking forward to seeing more when episode 3 comes out.Many critiques I have seen so far have been thinly veiled opposing fans who simply haven't given this program a true chance. Which is really too bad as a non Celtics fan I am still able to be thoroughly engaged.,False
5,10,Celtics...A Way Of Life,theotherjohnscott,n/a,16/08/2025,"A marvelous series on the best sports franchise of all time and leading off with the Greatest Of All Time, Bill Russell. I watched them all, except for a few I had to listen to on radio. This series , for those who were not fans, gives you all the reasons to become a fanatic. A quarter century of the Ellay Lakers choking on Red's cigar smoke. Interviews with Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain showing how utterly devastated and broken they were because of Boston. And all the championships. Russell with a ring for every finger, both thumbs and one to wear around his neck. Bob Cousy, the Houdini of the Hardwood. My personal idol, John Havlicek Only 2 episodes in and we have yet to consider Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Dave Cowens,Dennis Johnson, Paul Pierce. So many winners and so much winning. This series shows just how easy it was to be a Celtics fan and explores just how transformative the times and the players were. Simply marvelous.",False
6,10,10/10 from Celtics fan since 1979,imdbfan-6963092268,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've watched the Boston Celtics since 1979 while growing up, living in PEI Canada. I got to see the 80's big three, the 08-10 big three as well as the current team play live at both gardens. I've read most Celtics books and watched most of the videos/documentaries available dating back to the founding of the club. I am absolutely loving this series. Bill Simmons is showing that he put his Celtic's ðŸ’š into this series as the Executive Producer - well done Bill !I expect any Celtics fan will love this series as it is hitting all the big story lines/eras from 1957-
the first championship - and onwards. I can't wait for the next episode.",False
7,10,Watched 4 Eps till now,Pradeep6097089,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have watched 4 episodes. I am a neutral, not even from the US, a middle-aged guy who used to watch a bit of MJ in the 1990s. Some years back, I came back to BB for Steph and his 3-point magic. So, I don't like/dislike any team or player, barring MJ who I adore.So, I watched The Last Dance and loved it. Surprisingly, this is even better than TLD docu, because, while TLD focused on one season and one person mainly, ""Celtics City"" focuses on real-life issues, and its relationship with basketball. It is a very touching series in that sense. Sports can be a great unifier and throws light on society's darker areas, but it can't rectify those issues.This is a lovely documentary on many things Celtics and some things Boston. The title seems so apt, and in one sense, a frightening reminder about the risks of not learning from history, whether it is B. Ball or society at large.I don't know anything about Boston, but I know just enough -- that 2024 was Celtics all the way. Has Boston caught up with the Celtics? Not sure.",False
8,10,A Slam Dunk of Storytelling: Celtics City Delivers a Championship-Worthy Documentary,MrskiViletic,n/a,16/08/2025,"Celtics City is a masterfully crafted nine-part documentary series that chronicles the illustrious history of the Boston Celtics, the NBA's most storied franchise. Directed by Emmy winner Lauren Stowell and executive produced by Bill Simmons and Connor Schell, the series offers an in-depth exploration of the team's journey from its inception to its record-breaking 18th championship in 2024.The documentary seamlessly weaves together over 80 interviews with Celtics legends-ranging from Bob Cousy and Larry Bird to Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown-with never-before-seen archival footage. This rich tapestry captures the essence of the Celtics' legacy, highlighting not only their on-court triumphs but also their significant cultural and societal impact. Notably, the series delves into the team's role in breaking the NBA color barrier and addresses the complex racial dynamics of Boston, underscoring the franchise's commitment to social justice.With its blend of historical footage, candid interviews, and thoughtful exploration of the team's impact on and off the court, Celtics City is a must-watch for basketball enthusiasts and history buffs alike. The series not only celebrates the Celtics' achievements but also provides a nuanced look at the cultural and social dynamics that have shaped the franchise.",False
9,10,Phenomenal,xrjrbvhpdy,n/a,16/08/2025,"The best documentary I have ever seen. Incredibly well done providing insight to one of the most fascinating sports journeys in history. The ups and downs, the good and the bad, and the strength to persevere. Bill Russell was a hero. Larry Bird was a legend. The city is flawed, but authentic and wonderful. The fans passionate like no other fan base in sport. It reminds me of the sorrow (Len Bias, Reggie Lewis), disappointment (2008 vintage and their injuries), but satisfaction (2024). The characters from Chief to Walton to Max to Rondo to Doc to Mazzulla.Kudos to all involved - a masterpiece.",False
10,1,Hard Pass,scottiepippen,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Celtic City"" promised an in-depth, gritty look at the Boston Celtics' storied history. What viewers received instead was a masterclass in historical inaccuracy and baffling editorial choices. From a montage of blurry, low-resolution footage set to a generic soundtrack, it was clear this wasn't going to be the definitive Celtics documentary.The series, spanning a bloated nine episodes, seemed determined to rewrite history, often for no discernible reason. Key moments were glossed over, while inconsequential bench warmers received extended, rambling interviews. The editing felt like a fever dream, jumping erratically between decades, often within the same sentence. One moment we're witnessing the intensity of the Bird-Magic rivalry, the next we're subjected to a five-minute segment on a character no one remembers, and frankly, no one should.The ""expert"" commentary was equally perplexing. Retired players, whose memories seemed as hazy as the archival footage, offered vague anecdotes and contradictory accounts. The series' narration, delivered in a monotone drone, added to the overall sense of disinterest. It felt as if the creators had simply compiled a random assortment of clips and interviews, stitched them together with duct tape, and called it a documentary.Perhaps the most egregious offense was the series' treatment of the Celtics' legendary figures. Bill Russell, Larry Bird, and Paul Pierce, among others, had their accomplishments misrepresented. Instead, the series fixated on bizarre tangents, and glossed over year's of rampant racism. ""Celtic City"" is less a documentary and more a cautionary tale - a testament to how badly a beloved sports franchise's history can be exaggerated and shoved down America's throat. Skip it.",False

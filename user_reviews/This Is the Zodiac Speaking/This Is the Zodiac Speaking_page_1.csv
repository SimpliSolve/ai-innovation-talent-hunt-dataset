1,8,Knowing Who Committed The Crimes And Proving It Are Two Very Different Things,cantrelayne,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI read Graysmith's book in '86, and watched the movie in '7. If you have done same, this series will not be news to you. Knowing who committed the crimes and proving it are two very different things, and the public always forgets this, especially the longer a case goes on. Also, what people always forget on these older cases is where humans and society are at, in technology, systems, analysis and investigative tools AT THE TIME of the crime(s). This will never change, and in a lot of cases, is a hindrance to said investigation. What is new is that there are witnesses. There was a confession and definite behaviours that all point the same direction. There is possibly a murder weapon. I do believe the police would not take David Seawater's statements seriously. Any notorious case, especially at an Internationally known level, gets way too many false ""leads"" and there just is not enough resources to track it all, computers or not. As to the idea that a DNA lab can be bribed to speed up, that is just plain false. That said this documentary was made over several years, so waiting 6 more months should not have been an issue. It does not state if the police are paying for the lab or the Seawater family, and that right there will tell you the what and the why the lab will take longer. Private testing is always faster, and will be released to the submitter. If the police are testing it, there is a whole bunch of ridiculous rules and regs on if the results even get released to the public or not. If that is the case then the documentary did what it should've done. If there is no DNA specimen taken from the people the Zodiac stabbed, which in the time frame - probably NOT - then the process takes even longer because you have to ask the family members to contribute and it's a long process. It doesn't come out in 10 seconds like on TV. This documentary could have dug deeper though. Hopefully, the police have copies of all the information and tapes the Seawater family has, and hopefully they are digging in further. However, I would not be surprised if they did not. Again, the police resources, especially in the San Fran area, are very, very thin. That said there is enough legitimate evidence to be a circumstantial case, as there was in 1986, against Allen. The Seawater family, especially David, backs up a majority of it. David is right, there is a lot of apathy and tunnel vision on solving this case. Knowing who committed the crimes and proving it are two very different things. There should be no blame on this family, except for the mother's complicity. The sad fact is the Zodiac killer is dead and has been for a long while, so no case will ever go to trial. No trial, no closed case.",True
2,6,It's Decent But Not Fully Encompassing,ThereelscoopwithKK,n/a,16/08/2025,"After having watched the movie Zodiac many times I watched this hoping I would get a lot more evidence one way or another. This documentary certainly does provide a fair amount of evidence suggesting that it was in fact Arthur Leigh Allen. Based on what it shows and what I know previously if I had to bet it would be that it was him. However , not to say Graysmith is wrong , but the entire theories presented do always seem to come through him. I had some suspicion while watching that this was the case in this as well.What I've realized is that there was simply nothing to really stick to Allen outside of circumstantial evidence . For crimes of this scope the threshold level for evidence is quite high.In the end the accounts of the children grown up I found very interesting and certainly made me believe it was Allen even more. However, after reflection I still would need to see DNA that was not found. There certainly was huge motivation to get this guy, but their unwillingness to try him for all the crimes shows that the attorneys couldn't build a case to meet the thresholds.Overall on a private level, I do believe it was him. From a legal perspective , I would need something larger in terms of evidence, which clearly is why it is still considered a cold case.For all the Zodiac victims sakes I do hope they find something extremely conclusive. It's horrid Zodiac was able to get away with this level of evil.",False
3,8,Well made and interesting.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"A family welcome in big and burly teacher, Arthur Leigh Allen into their world, he seems perfect, caring and considerate, but could he potentially be The Zodiac killer, a masked figure, who's claimed several victims, and delights in tormenting The Authorities.A well known story, a fairly infamous serial killer, one that of course inspired an excellent movie adaptation.It's revealing and shocking in equal measure, with some fascinating first hand interviews, with people who knew Allen well.It's well paced and well produced, it will keep you on your toes, it does tail off a little bit in the third episode, but those behind it can't be blamed, as there's no resolution, only theories.It's a story that's always intrigued me, and I've never had any doubts as to Allen's guilt, this three last series did nothing to change my mind, I still believe he's guilty, I'm just stunned they weren't able to convict him.8/10.",False
4,7,Reasonably Well Put Together,Yellow_Argiope,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's not perfect, but given how problematic true crime media has become, this one is decent with interesting interviews and a directing style that is not overdramatized.Overall, I enjoyed the style, presentation, and content of this documentary. The interviews are well captured and edited for the most part. The victim stories are not the primary focus, but the content manages to be respectful to their deaths and loved ones.While there are compelling personal accounts shown in a suspenseful way, don't expect too many definitive answers.Also, let's be real. I think we all know that the real Zodiac Killer is Ted Cruz.",True
5,10,"leigh allen, the one",mossflower-79808,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've always been intrigued by the statements from these brothers, and it amazed me that no one had done anything about it... until now! Without a doubt, Arthur Leigh Allen was, is, and will be the number one suspect-miles ahead of anyone else, light-years, even. There's a huge amount of circumstantial evidence, way beyond the ordinary, and when you add in the experiences of these brothers, I've got no doubt he was the killer. Let's not forget that a survivor from the Lake Berryessa side and Michael Mageau identified him as their attacker, among a ton of other things. A narcissist and an egomaniac with two faces. Hopefully, his guilt can finally be confirmed, because there's no one else who even comes close to him.",False
6,7,"A very good documentary, but not perfect",Podkowa,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Zodiac Killer"" is the first serial killer that intrigued me. I was maybe 8 years old when I first saw a documentary about him. Since then, I have been returning to the topic from time to time, listening to podcasts on the subject and generally being interested in new facts in the investigation. I've watched a lot of documentaries on the subject, listened to podcasts, and even read books, so I had to see this documentary as well. Was it possible to create a complete film about this monster in human skin this time?No. But it doesn't matter at all, because this film is very close to being a perfect summary of a long-term investigation for those who have been following the case for a long time, and at the same time to be a shortcut for those who only know about Zodiac from David Fincher's film.So why did the film get a 7/10 from me and not a 9/10, if it is ""almost perfect""? Because in my opinion it is too fictionalized. There are too many unnecessary stories, too many digressions and asking questions, and not enough accurate presentation of the facts about Zodiac.Nevertheless, it is worth watching this film to judge for yourself whether the way it is presented suits your taste. For me, it was slightly too long for the amount of information it gives. It could easily have had two episodes instead of three, if only those genre scenes, which did not add much to the film, were abandoned.",False
7,8,Closure ?,TomatoesareRotten,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most of us have seen the Fincher movie covering the facts ( but having watched this series , the aforementioned facts are brought into question ) , but if you haven't , I'd recommend that you do , to give a reasonable perspective . A serial killer - one of several at the time - terrorised the California area throughout the sixties and seventies . Part of his modus operandi was taunting both the Press and the Police departments of the affected crime scenes . The movie was released in 2007 and they couldn't portray several details as the prime suspect was at that point unproven . This series unravels why and it doesn't show the detectives in the original investigation in a great light . Add to that , the incredible involvement of a whole family , who could be deemed complicit , if not naive in the extreme .",False
8,n/a,If this..,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf this three-parter didn't convince you that predator was the Zodiac, then I honestly don't think that anything will be able to. Well.. unless there are finger prints on the letters that can be tested (Have they checked this? Nobody mentioned it..)It's ""coincidence"" upon ""coincidence"", and it only becomes more convincing the further into the episodes you go. Arthur Leigh Allen always seemed to be in the same place, or close to, where the murders were committed.. at the right time. He also had a divers watch with the text Zodiac and the exact same symbol as those on the ciphers. Then we have the claimed confession to one of the Seawater brothers that loved Arthur Leigh Allen.. and some things from the letters he wrote to Phyllis (btw.. I think Phyllis knew and was in deep denial).To doubt Arthur Leigh Allen guilt at this stage, is quite delusional.",True
9,7,Still A lot To Mull Over,Pairic,n/a,16/08/2025,"This Is the Zodiac Speaking: A nasty guy alright, at times he wanted to encourage people to think he was Zodiac, even wrote letters to people suggesting that he had carried out the murders. But just before he died he denied it, wrote a letter which was discovered when he was found dead. Certainly some circumstantial evidence, the testimony of those families he interacted with and abused is interesting. Their memories stretching back 50 years might not be so reliable though as to his actions in proximity to attack sites. Maybe he was just a sad petty predator who had dreams of being an infamous serial killer. Still the series is worth watching even I think it could have been done in 2 rather than 3 episodes. Directed by Phil Lott and Ari Mark. On Netflix. 7/10.",False
10,9,Brings closure to the debate of who was the Zodiac killer,fraserkahler,n/a,16/08/2025,"The most compelling circumstantial evidence provided to the public. Watch this documentary to get an insight into the family exposed and linked to a strong suspect for the Zodiac serial killings.Arguably this is the most renowned serial murder case in the US that has gone unsolved for decades. The family associated with Arthur Leigh Allen provide their insight to growing up with a man who they trusted and accepted into their family. As the decades pass and they reflect on their dealings with the suspect, they begin to piece together that Arthur Leigh Allen, the person they welcomed into their family, could very well be the notorious Zodiac killer that has evaded conviction for decades.This documentary should provide more focus for detectives to come to a final conclusion on the Zodiac killer.",False
11,7,What is the Truth?,lornak-18008,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really was fascinated by this docuseries and watched it back to back. I'm a big true crime fan so of course I am very familiar with the case and the movie that was made many years ago. Admittedly, I couldn't remember all the details as it began more than fifty years ago. This series focus was on a school teacher and the family he took under his wing back then. The family had six children and a father residing in a state mental institution. The teacher, Mr. Allen, begins hanging around the family and taking the children away on short trips. Even before it's said you know where the story is heading. Grooming children 101. But over and above that was that the man was the biggest suspect for being the Zodiac killer although there were others. This group of children-3 of them-were supposedly with him when he killed a young couple on a beach, although they didn't realize it back then. They helped clean blood off his hands. Supposedly. And never told anyone but their mother for fifty years. Their mother who they believe kept Mr. Allen's secret until the day she died. Initially, I believed this story. But after reading other reviews I realize how one sided(the family)the story actually is. But that doesn't mean there's no truth to it either. What is true is that the zodiac killer existed but nobody knows for sure who he was.",True
12,8,"After this, how can we not think that Arthur Leigh Allen was the Zodiac Killer?",LeonardoOliva69,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Zodiac Killer must be one of the most compelling cases in the history of forensics.A monstrous being, ahead of its time.When you read the stories you can't help but feel sorry for the victims, their families and the police. No one was prepared for a being of this magnitude.This miniseries gives us a very interesting point of view.Arthur Leigh Allen was always the number 1 suspect, all the circumstantial evidence, the fact that he had been in the area of several murders on the same days that they occurred and even his identification by the survivors.However, he could never be locked up and died prematurely from his kidney disease.In the Seawater stories there is so much pain, so much darkness lived, so many traces followed that it is impossible not to follow this conjecture. ALA was the Zodiac Killer, without a doubt. Egomaniac, narcissist, abuser, with extremely useful skills and talents... all the combo to do what he surely did.It's a shame that David has passed away and will not be able to see the end of this story. I am left frozen by the bond with his mother and how she was/could have been an accomplice to this for so many years. A destroyed family, a sister who would clearly be one of the next victims and who was saved by a miracle.Finally, the hope that the knife he gave to Connie's son will finally reveal that truth that has been awaited for more than 50 years...",False
13,6,We are still in limbo,lakovicadis_1988,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt just seems strange that all of those people didnt suspect anything, even though it was reported on all stations and newspapers, at least he would left some evidence somewhere. The robot picture is with glasses, he had hoodie, nothin was ever founded. Im not saying he is not the the killer, but nothing was proven, so all possibilities are still open. From all 3 episodes only thing we have is she said he said.... to be hones, we got more clues about the man from the movie, than from this doku.The main suspect didnt look like a genius or mysterious, and to kill that many people without been caught it doesnt add up, we are missing something. I hope in the future thay will solve this onve and for all.",True
14,3,Another Zodiac Rush to Judgement,jburtonprod-802-759029,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was looking forward to this series but it turns out to be another Robert Graysmith propaganda film. The entire series is based on the interviews of the Seawater family, who were family friends of one of the Zodiac suspects, Arthur Leigh Allen.We are expected to believe them even though they never brought forth this story to the authorities. There is no way to confirm anything they're saying. Their testimony would be useless in a court of law.What the series leaves out is ANY speculation the Zodiac could be anyone other than Arthur Leigh Allen. What they also leave out is the considerable amount of physical evidence that Allen was NOT the Zodiac.Allen gave two handwriting samples with both hands, since he was ambidextrous. They were studied by a number of handwriting experts. Both samples came up NOT a match. The ballistic tests of all of Allen's guns came back negative to the bullets found in the murders. The bloody fingerprints that were on the taxicab of Paul Stine were NOT a match. The partial palm print that was lifted off one of the confirmed Zodiac letters was NOT a match. Finally, the partial DNA sample off one the stamps on one of the confirmed Zodiac letters ruled out Arthur Leigh Allen. In short. While there may be a lot of circumstantial evidence pointing to Allen as the Zodiac. There is substantial amount of physical evidence he was NOT.This docuseries was not good investigative journalism. It worked backward from the producer's chosen suspect and left out anything that contradicted its main theory.The Zodiac case remains unsolved and this docuseries did nothing to bring it closer to a solution.",False
15,6,Is he the one?,tarascopablo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary provides some interesting leads and conclusiones as to identity of the famous Zodiac Killer.His case has been one of the most interesting unsolved mysteries of modern times and after watching all the pieces of the puzzle that this documentary has provided, i am inclined to believe that the identity of Zodiac was probably that of Arthur Leigh Allen.The interviews and testimonies of the Seawater family seem to be pretty compelling.In my mind, there is no room for doubt.The documentary does state, however, that some DNA testing is still pending and hopefully the results will be released soon, thus proving the theory as right or wrong.In terms of film making, the documentary itself is well crafted, with interesting rhytm and the right amount of editing.",True
16,10,Without a Doubt,PopcornPlease,n/a,16/08/2025,"After seeing this well-done and thoroughly researched series, Arthur Leigh Allen was the Zodiac Killer. Of this I am certain. Others can drone on about circumstantial evidence and speculate and doubt all they want, but anyone who doesn't think it was Allen after seeing this series is deeply in denial or just doesn't want to believe the obvious. What it really boils down to is this: many people, especially armchair detectives, love a good mystery, so much so that they hope the mystery won't be solved. When it involves infamous criminals, such cases take on a life of their own and they want the mystery to continue. So when a longstanding case is finally solved, they're actually disappointed because there's no longer any mystery in their lives. They also refuse to believe that someone other than themselves solved it. It's all rather sad.",False
17,7,Unsettling but interesting,cb_whitewood,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not super knowledgeable on the Zodiac Killer, details on the related crimes, investigation, etc... but I still found myself interested and engaged while watching this series. This series is a deep-dive into who many assume to be the actual Zodiac, plus interviews with people who knew him while they themselves were kids. (Scary in hindsight.)While there's no direct proof implicating him, ALA and the Zodiac show a lot of similarities in their capacity to plan, scheme and cover their trails. The fact that these former-kids recall being brought to a (soon to be) crime scene, among other details, leave me pretty convinced. That being said, I'm no investigator. :) I would recommend this series to anyone curious about how serial killers maintain their ""normal"" appearances in between their crimes.",False
18,10,Gives a sense of actual closure,memphisgreene,n/a,16/08/2025,"Zodiac is one of my favorite films of all time, and this doc adds a new compelling layer to it; a companion piece, sort of. Interviews include the real Robert Graysmith and footage of Arthur Leigh Allen and the people he hurt. It confirms how much attention to detail was put into the movie, and how important it was to some people who interacted with the main suspect. There is a lot of information I wasn't aware of and unlike most unsolved serial killer documentaries where they almost leave you wondering what the point of what you watched was, this one provides some semblance of closure. It's absolutely compelling and worth a watch.",False
19,8,Zodiac with the Real images,AvionPrince16,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo i really loved that documentary and found it very interesting and well made .I heard about the Zodiac trough the movie of David Fincher and when i saw this documentary : i said why not watched it ?? And probably its a nice opportunity to know more about the real facts that inspired by the movies but i was really surprised how close it was to the reality and the movie didnt exaggerate a thing.So i was very into that documentary and we got surprised with the revelations , murders . But also we get frustrated at the end : we still dont know who is the Zodiac and the case is still open .I love also that intimate touch with the interviews of the people who were close to him and i really enjoyed that sentimal touch of the documentary and we got also some exclusive images trough the journalist and some interviews from the police. And i found it really interesting.Even if its not Allen some things was still horrible to know : that he abused of some childs that he were close with . And yeah the truth was surprising anyway . But the Zodiac is still unknown and i still dont regret to have watched that documentary and to know more about Allen and all its case: with the mysteries , murders, Riddles and revelations .I really recommend that documentary .And who knows ? Maybe the Zodiac will speak again Soon.",True
20,8,Frustrating,Mehki_Girl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLike someone else said he may have been the Zodiac killer or he may have been just a pathetic child molester who wanted to appear to be the Zodiac killer. He was a very strange man indeedBut even stranger was a mother who would allow a man to be around her children to the degree he was, especially after he was incarcerated at Atascadero, a prison she was quite familiar with as her husband was incarcerated there for molesting his own daughter.Like what the heck was wrong with the mother??? She maintains close contact with this man over the years, including apparently sleeping with him and even after her adult son says he confessed to him for drugging these children and molesting the sister and she rather deny it and laughs about it.But this just goes to my contention -bnot always well received - that women are complicit in child molestation cases as much as men are, women more so, not necessarily through direct molestation, but through providing, procuring, making available, ignoring, denying molestation of their own or other children and doing absolutely nothing about it.Makes me sick.She basically entwined this man in her children's lives, making them think he was a okay and this feeling from them towards him lasted well into their adulthood to the point that the sister who was molested and the brother who may or may also have been molested, because he also molested boys as his criminal indictment indicated, to the point of estrangement from the sibling he confessed to because they needed to be in denial.I think this bothered me more in the documentary than the fact of the Zodiac killer being a murderous person.I would like to hear what the FBI profile was, because to me this was obviously a man who hated young women and I would posit that that hatred had a lot to do with his childhood and teenagehood of being rejected by girls. He was a big hulking guy and perhaps not particularly attractive to young girls of the same age.Anyway, overall, I thought this was well done - not too far stretched out as some documentaries are, a little frustrating because of the mother as well, whom I came to dislike even more than the Zodiac killer if that's possible, as well as the naivete of these adults recounting their childhood.I'm from San Francisco, but by the time these murders started in 1963 I was probably living on the East Coast and of course I would have been too young to even realize what was going on back then. Interesting enough I'm familiar with Clear Lake, as my dad owned property up there and used to take us out on this boat on the lake. If it's the same Clear Lake that I'm familiar with it's up past Napa Valley and it's literally at the top of a mountain in a crater from an old volcano.This is pretty well done. The episodes are only 53 or so minutes long and pretty easy to binge watch - you do want to be looking at your television set and not playing on your phone as a lot of images are played out, so it's not all talking heads.Personally I think that Mr Allen as the children, now adults call him, was the Zodiac killer and if he wasn't he was still a sick f* for toying with the idea and for molesting children, because of course he did... Can't get that Mom out of my head! Those children deserved so much better... How the sister could deny it when she herself says he had his hand down her pedalpushers when they were on that trip in which they were very drowsy and the brother couldn't wake up. How could you stay in denial as an adult with children of your own and now knowing that a man with his hand down your pants even though it didn't bother you as a child.... I don't know...why...?",True
21,5,An interesting but flawed look at the Zodiac,stoob0t,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe docuseries focuses on the memories and experiences of the children of the Seawater family; a family seemingly very close to the only police-named suspect in the Zodiac case: Arthur Leigh Allen.The series centres on the now-adult Seawater children, whose mother was a close friend of Allen, and the time that the children remember spending with Allen throughout their youth.From the outset, the documentary is centres itself around a narrative that Arthur Leigh Allen was 'The Zodiac', that there are no other reasonable suspects in the case, and that the Seawater family are essentially the 'smoking gun' that finally proves Allen was the Zodiac.While the series itself is well filmed, reasonably well paced and presented, it has some significant flaws that can't easily be overlooked. The documentary largely acts as a confirmatory expansion of Robert Graysmith's book (Zodiac, 1996) and David Fincher's 2007 film adaptation of the same - featuring Graysmith's thoughts and accounts just as prominently as the Seawaters' (as well as multiple references back to the 2007 film). This production treats Graysmith's deductions as fact, and never suggests that anyone other than Allen could have been the Zodiac - which actively ignores a body of evidence which strongly suggests that Allen as NOT the Zodiac.As much as the accounts of the Seawaters are undoubtedly clear, compelling and highly emotive... they could also be said to be suspiciously precise for the memories of young children. At no time is there any challenge to their recollection or any scrutiny of the events that they claim took place.The number of events and roadtrips that the Seawater's recall, which overlap with murders attributed (and not formally attributed) to the Zodiac, makes for interesting viewing - but start to become suspiciously convenient. One specific account suggests that Allen drove, with the Seawater children, for more than two hours, to arrive at a secluded beach at the precise time that a couple who fit the Zodiac MO would be there, and then killed them while the children were still with the car. Like other accounts, the uncanny convenience of this is never probed or questioned, and the account is instead presented as fact.Throughout the latter part of the series, it is heavily implied that Allen groomed and abused Connie Seawater, despite her memory of this being virtually non-existent as a result of being perportedly drugged. This is also something that the documentary makers never really challenge or explore in greater depth, although there is no questioning that Arthur Leigh Allen was a convicted child sex offender.While the Seawater's ultimately believe, as Robert Graysmith does, that Arthur Leigh Allen was indeed the Zodiac - presenting this case as though there are no other suspects and ignoring any of the evidence which suggests that Allen was NOT the Zodiac, results in a heavily biased documentary which in reality gets us no closer to the case being closed.The absence of any direct interview with others who were involved in the case, or with surviving victims puts a very large elephant in the room.What is obvious, however, from their accounts is that Arthur Leigh Allen was an important person in the Seawater's lives, who they have fond yet deeply conflicted memories of that they struggle to reconcile.",True
22,8,Well-made complement to the movie,makstz,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf everything the Seawaters say is true, then Arthur Leigh Allen is either the Zodiac killer or the unluckiest person in American criminal history. They place him at the scene of most of the Zodiac killings. The real revelation for me concerns the ""Albany"" letter. In 1973 someone claiming to be the Zodiac sent a letter to the police from Albany and included a cryptogram with the name of their next victim. I was always skeptical of this, especially when it was announced that the code had been cracked and the name was Connie Henly, who apparently didn't exist. Connie Seawater's revelation in this documentary that she was living in upstate New York at the time, that Allen was communicating with her, and that her mother's maiden name was Hensley, which Allen likely would have known, is an absolutely incredible coincidence.Some commenters rightly point out that there is no smoking gun against Allen, and we shouldn't discount all the other suspects. However, they also go too far in their efforts to discredit the case against him:
1. It's true that the handwriting on the Zodiac letter didn't match Allen, but a moment's consideration should tell you that handwriting analysis is only really valid when done fluidly and unconsciously. Only a moron would send a threatening letter to the police and not take steps to disguise their handwriting.2. The bloody finger and palm print is also suspicious. The Zodiac wore gloves during the murder, the bloody gloves were found in the back seat of the cab. Why would he take care to wear gloves but be careless enough to leave a bloody print. It's very possible that the print was left by a bystander or cop who was too embarrassed or scared to admit it was him.3. The fact that the ballistics didn't match isn't necessarily proof that he was innocent, it could just mean that he disposed of the guns.4. The DNA testing of the envelopes and stamps are interesting, but not conclusive. It only proves that Allen didn't lick the envelope. Don Cheney gave an interview where he made the astounding claim that Allen once asked him to seal some envelopes for him, and he agreed. Even if you don't believe him, it's another example of how strange this case is.5. Finally, the eye witness testimony is mixed, but it's well known that eye witnesses are the least reliable form if identification, especially when people are under stress.",True

Having viewed the statements of these brothers on YouTube some time ago, I had assumed that all avenues of investigation had been exhausted. However, upon watching this documentary, I am pleased to see that further inquiry was undertaken.

24,8,Was it him or not ?,imknight,n/a,16/08/2025,If you have seen the movie Zodiac then this is good viewing and if you have not then watch it after . While it's very probable Allen was the Zodiac it is a bit disappointing that this documentary didn't explore other suspects because there would of been clues for them to be the Zodiac as well . Other than that it still is worth watching for the intertwined relationships he had with those children and the Mother. Guilty or not of murder he was still a child molester and yet the mother kept it secret . There should be an absolute coroner finding that he was the killer after all this time . You would of though though he would of confessed on his death bed .,False
25,8,Three stars,Lynn_831,n/a,16/08/2025,"This Is the Zodiac Speaking dives into the chilling narrative surrounding the infamous Zodiac Killer, a case that has captivated true crime enthusiasts for decades. The film offers a blend of historical drama and psychological intrigue, but while it shines in some areas, it also has notable shortcomings that prevent it from being a standout entry in the genre.The Good1. Intriguing Subject Matter: The film's exploration of the Zodiac Killer case is both fascinating and chilling. The storyline effectively captures the terror that gripped California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, engaging viewers who are intrigued by true crime and unsolved mysteries. The film shines in its ability to portray the societal impact of the killings and the ensuing panic, making it a compelling watch for fans of the genre.2. Strong Performances: The cast delivers impressive performances, particularly those portraying the investigators and victims. Their ability to convey the fear, urgency, and determination surrounding the case adds depth to the narrative. The interactions among characters provide insight into the psychological toll the investigation takes on those involved, enhancing the film's emotional weight.3. Atmospheric Cinematography: The cinematography captures the essence of the era beautifully. The film's moody lighting and careful attention to detail transport viewers back in time, immersing them in the late 1960s setting. This atmospheric quality enhances the tension, making the viewer feel the pervasive dread and anxiety that characterized the time.4. Engaging Narrative Style: The film employs a storytelling structure that intertwines various perspectives, providing a well-rounded view of the investigation. This multi-faceted approach not only keeps the audience engaged but also emphasizes the different ways the Zodiac case impacted the lives of those involved, from law enforcement to the victims' families.The Bad1. Pacing Issues: One of the most significant drawbacks of This Is the Zodiac Speaking is its uneven pacing. Certain segments feel drawn out, which can detract from the suspense and momentum. Viewers may find themselves losing interest during slower scenes that interrupt the narrative flow, potentially diminishing the overall tension that the film aims to create.2. Factual Inaccuracies: While the film strives to stay true to the Zodiac case, some critics point out factual inaccuracies or embellishments that may frustrate true crime purists. These deviations from the actual events can lead to confusion for viewers unfamiliar with the case and may detract from the film's credibility for those who are well-versed in the history.3. Lack of Resolution: Given the nature of the Zodiac Killer case-one that remains officially unresolved-some viewers may find the film's conclusion unsatisfying. The lack of a definitive ending can leave audiences with a sense of ambiguity that may not resonate with all viewers, especially those seeking closure in their cinematic experiences.4. Character Development: While the performances are commendable, some characters lack the depth necessary for viewers to form a strong emotional connection. The film could have benefited from further exploration of the personal lives and motivations of key figures, which would have added complexity to the narrative and enhanced viewer investment.Overall ImpressionThis Is the Zodiac Speaking offers a gripping look at one of history's most notorious true crime cases, bolstered by strong performances and an atmospheric setting. However, pacing issues, factual inaccuracies, and a lack of resolution may leave some viewers wanting more. If you're a fan of true crime stories and appreciate the historical context, this film is worth a watch, but be prepared for a narrative that doesn't fully deliver on its potential. Ultimately, it stands as a moderately engaging film that, while intriguing, doesn't quite reach the heights of greatness one might hope for in a story of such chilling significance.",False

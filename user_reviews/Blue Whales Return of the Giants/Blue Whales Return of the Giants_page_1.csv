1,10,Majestic and magical,wac85,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this today at IMAX 3D it was absolutely captivating and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I love all docos.(tangent alert, and especially David Attenborough. His book 'A life on our planet' is worth a read. What a man) Humans really need to sort their shi* out. Back to the Whales. There is something so majestic and otherworldly about these beautiful creatures. I really wonder and it bothers me deeply about the stupidity of man kind and the seemingly lack of counciousness and connection to nature and the planet, with the mindless acts of greed and violence upon Mother Nature and on the incredible wildlife in it. The entire cinema was captivated - and I noticed all the children were silent! Seeing this doco on the big screen with 3D is nothing short of spectacular. What incredible footage and work by a special group of people! Fascinating. Loved it. IMAX 3D really is the best.",False

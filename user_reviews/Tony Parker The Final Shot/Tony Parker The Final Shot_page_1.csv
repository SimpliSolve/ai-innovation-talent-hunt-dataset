1,7,One of the greatest Europeans basketball players,stylianosoteriou,n/a,17/08/2025,"Very good doc for a great player! Tony Parker is one of the best European players who played in NBA and not only! But who knows about European basketball and Tony's tries to win the Eurobasket knows that before he did it in 2013, his worst nightmare was the lost from Greece on semi finals in 2006! If France could win this game they would play against Germany in final and obvious they could win them easily like Greece did! So i believe do not mention Eurobasket 2006 on this doc its a big mistake!",False
2,6,Solid,mihailorado,n/a,17/08/2025,"Its a doc on Tony Parker... what do you expect. The documentary is a movie form of the Spurs Dynasty. Explains everything well enough, but isnt anything special. If youre a big Spurs fan or a Frenchman you will like it more than others, but it isnt bad... slightly boring... but decent",False
3,6,Tony Parker: The Final Shot 2021 Review,chandean-69762,n/a,17/08/2025,"This wasn't bad, it just felt like there was no real purpose for this doc and felt pretty safe in terms of conflicts / controversy's. I even found myself losing some interest at times, especially with how much this doc jumps around.Born and raised here in San Antonio it was good to see some love for the city and for The Spurs, i'm not the biggest into basketball but I think I can safely say that The Spurs are a big part of my life. I can vividly remember that 2014 Championship game.",False
4,7,Very interesting Documentary from Tony Parker,tomlaju,n/a,17/08/2025,"Right now I'm in period where I following NBA and basketball sport and as French man I know Tony Parker and his documentary was pretty interesting to know his background to get a great NBA player !!!His background it's very interesting cause from the earliest age it's talk about the fact the "" work "" and discipline it's the key of every success and that's true and put that forward it's too good especially for young people who got a big dreams to achieve or person who got to work it's very good message for the audience !!!The interviews about people around him(friends, coach, family) was very interesting even him self too !The different shoot in directing was not great but I think so it's was not the goal of Parker to get focus on it but rather to explain his interesting background!!!!Not a lot of musics or great music's throughout the documentary too bad !But the archive images were good about his childhood !!!",False
5,6,"I'm not a big basketball guy, and I didn't know anything about Tony Parker.",matthewssilverhammer,n/a,17/08/2025,"This doc does a great job of introducing us to him and getting us to sympathize with and like him, not because he's perfect, but because he's simply decent. I wish it focused more on his years in America, where the drama was (and superstars were) bigger, instead of rushing to get back to the European stuff...but maybe that's just xenophobia talking.",False
6,2,Not the best doco ever,pjcons4,n/a,17/08/2025,He's not the most exciting person going around so the movie followed suit. Kinda boring for me as I love basketball documentaries and this one was the worst by a mile.,False
7,4,"Ok. Careful, it's in French with English subtitles",Xavier_Stone,n/a,17/08/2025,"It's not at all easy to watch as most of the time you're switching back and forth from reading the subtitles and watching the video. Tony, who is from France mostly takes a back seat in this doc and has all of the French media, his friends and team mates comment about him. Sure he was a good player and had some winning seasons and some titles.I had to start skipping ahead as I wasn't really interested in his childhood or his impact on France and the NBA. Maybe the last 10 mins are NBA footage clips intertwined with media admiration. Not really a good doc in my opinion, offers no insight, no mysteries. I'm sure there is one of these players on every professional team with a similar story.",False

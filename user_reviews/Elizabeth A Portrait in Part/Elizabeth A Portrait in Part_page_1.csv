1,7,A Nostalgic and moving Tribute,tm-sheehan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Elizabeth: A Portrait in Parts (2022)
A Documentary- My Rating 7/10This Scrapbook documentary depicts the long life and times of an extraordinary 20th and 21st Century monarch Queen Elizabeth 11 who is celebrating her Platinum Jubilee this year as well her 96th birthday . It's a Cinematic tribute to an extraordinary woman who is history's longest serving head of state.I found it a nostalgic and very creative trip down memory lane as I was born a year after the Queens first born son Charles who one day is destined to be King . The world has changed so much in those 73 years but The Queen has been a constant and stable influence during her ten decades on the planet.Elizabeth: A Portrait in Parts is Directed by Roger Michell who sadly died last year so this is his last film . His 2nd last feature film The Duke is also currently showing in Cinemas but it's a comedy and nothing to do with the Late Duke of Edinburg who of course features in this documentary.Some of Roger Michell's other great contributions to movies are Notting Hill (1999) Tea With the Dames (2018) ,Hyde Park on Hudson(2012) and Venus (2006) .He obviously loves the Cinema and I enjoyed the expertly cut clips of famous movies like Cleopatra and Roman Holiday that he uses very effectively to parallel the also expertly cut clips from Queen Elizabeth's long reign . There's also a lot of contemporary music and pop songs used in the soundtrack which add to the nostalgia. My favourite was when the Queen is visiting a machinery factory in the 1960's with Gracie Fields song ""I'm the girl who makes the thing .""as background.The original music for the film is by George Fenton (who composed the soundtrack to The Duke and many other fine movie scores.I particularly enjoyed the random scrap book like chapter titles used in the documentary like ""Let Me Entertain You, Ma'am, Heroes, Britannia, Horribilis, In the Saddle and Our House.The only narrative used really is the original used in the clips and we get to see the sensitivity and great humour of The Queen with some very personal material that covers the Queen's life as a child through to the present day.There are those who will possibly take issue with this film because of their republican principles but as Her Majesty has said, ""Let us not take ourselves too seriously. None of us have a monopoly on wisdom.""
I'm not one of them even though if a decent model for an Australian Republic was presented I would vote Yes for a Republic but I have deep affection and admiration for the Queen.This documentary may be streamed later on television but it's worth seeing on a Cinema screen if you can.",False
2,3,"Horrible direction, editing and music selection!",kxfqvnpqs,n/a,16/08/2025,"I admire Queen Elizabeth for her incredible work and service through 70 years on the Throne. I've seen many documentaries about her and the royal family. This documentary was awful! The scenes didn't have any coherence, jumping from one event to another and putting random moments of different movies or actresses or actors that had no connection with the event. The music selection was terrible! For instance, in moments of sadness (funerals) the music didn't reflect what was happening at that the moment. I rated 3 stars because I think the footage of Her Majesty is wonderful other than that, this whole project is not what I was expecting. I'm very disappointed.",False
3,1,Horrific direction and editing,kdcrowley-28003,n/a,16/08/2025,OMG. The cutting from HRM to Elizabeth Taylor is but one example of what can only be described as a bizarre and undignified look at Queen Elizabeth. It's like a bad dream. Did I mention the part with the Mona Lisa wearing a chef's hat? What?And it only gets worse from there.,False
4,10,"Creative, respectful, enjoyable and touching. Well done.",bay-77008,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ignore the negative reviews. This was not meant to be either a documentary or a tribute. Just like the title says, it's a portrait and it's made of film footage of the queen throughout her life (all complimentary) paired with one of more footages of people, places or events relatable in one way or another to the particular footage being shown. It was artistic and worked well. The music included some numbers perhaps only Brits would know but overall, it was a mix of oldies and today's music. Why not? The queen has lived though it all. I'm an anglophile from the US. I love the queen. This honored her in a way younger people can relate to. It's not stodgy and it shows the more human side of this wonderful woman. And without spoiling, the way they ended it, if you pay attention, is lovely.",False
5,1,Disrespectful hatchet job on a Grand Lady,MartynGryphon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBeing the occasion of Her Majesty's 70th jubilee, I watched this 'tribute' in the hopes that I could celebrate the many accomplishments that the Queen has achieved in the last 70 years. Instead all I saw was some cobbled together hatchet job that all but trashes on the tradition of monarchy.Instead of celebrating such a milestone, director. Roger Mitchell tries to imply that there is little or nothing to celebrate.He intersperses pictures of people waving Union flags at the silver jubilee in 1977 with people waving the same flag at right wing rallies as if to imply that pride in nation and tradition is in itself a fascist act.He also cuts between stock footage of the Queen in all her splendour shaking hands with celebrates at gala performances and state occasions and the squalid depictions of post war inner city Britain and the hardships her subjects faced in a bid to show some kind of disconnect between her and the country of which she is head of state.Queen or President, King or dictator really doesn't matter. All these things would have been caused by government policy over the years and would not be the fault of a Head of State, especially one who dedicated her life to serve all her dominions, selflessly, faithfully and honourably.He shows The Queen being jeered in Dresden as well as the public outcry at her perceived lack of feeling over the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, despite the tradition and protocol that would have been applied in such circumstances. He then commits the crowning indignity by equating this tragedy and subsequent public dissatisfaction with the storming of royal palaces, communist revolutions and the murder of the Russian royal family in 1918 with a picture of Lenin front and centre.This has been made, not from a position of respect for the Queen or her longevity, but to push another social and class agenda....that most left leaning film makers have an annoying knack for.Roger Mitchell is no longer with us and it's such a shame that this posthumous 'work' will now be an 'epitaph of shame', especially given that he was the director of Notting Hill. He didn't even attempt to thinly disguise his metaphors, nor his contempt for tradition or the Queen as everything good she has ever done or tried to do, he has linked with tragedies, catastrophe's and social strife.Do not watch this.",True
6,10,"Congratulations, a fine film",rljnewemail,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am always amused and slightly appalled by the extreme criterion folks use to judge art. They so often seem to have an agenda.This is a wonderful, enthralling documentary. I was enthralled, it made the journey of the queen a human one, a woman's story, and one that gives far more dignity than a bunch of British talking heads disputing the value of a monarchy ever could. This is a wildly creative look at her job, and her life, I hope I am lucky enough to suffer such 'disrespect' as a film about my self offered with such higher art than usually finds a documentary.",False
7,1,Horrifically bad,cjharding88,n/a,16/08/2025,"Queen Elizabeth II is the worlds most amazing lady. This abysmal mess is just awful and does her, nor the family any credit whatsoever in its production. Don't waste your time, there are plenty of better programmes out there on QEII regardless of whether you like her or you do not.",False
8,2,The music is just wrong,mgkdrtc,n/a,16/08/2025,Can't believe what a horrible job that's be done with this! The actual footage seeing the queen was nice but the way it's put together was just a kick in the nuts.,False
9,1,Maybe if I had hit a fatty....,wmsfmly,n/a,16/08/2025,"...it might have came across as having some type of message or meaning. IDK. After about the first 10 minutes I asked the Mrs. (who loves anything Royal), ""Do you have any idea what message they are trying to convey?"" All I got was a shrug. A LITTLE narration would have gone a long way. Random actual dialog, usually with odd or cutesee music playing, cuts to Star Trek clips, Cleopatra scenes, AARRGH!It's too bad there was a fair amount of historical footage, even if it was mish-mashed with movie clips could have told an interesting story. Don't expect much and maybe you won't be disappointed. Can't wait to clear it from my TIVO.",False
10,10,Thoroughly Enjoyable. An Education.,steveguitarist,n/a,16/08/2025,"First, any moron who thinks this is a publicity movie for the purposes of propaganda is exactly that...a moron. I'm an American. For all intent and purposes I am clueless in matters regarding the British monarchy. This film is a cleverly produced education. An insightful look at the life Queen Elizabeth II. If you're a fanatic for historical documentaries, as I am, you will absolutely enjoy Elizabeth: A Portrait in Part(s). Of course, if you're a member of the moronic ilk who believe that the hypocrites Harry and Meghan are heroic figures then you'll probably not appreciate this movie. No worries maybe someone will someday determine to waste time, energy and money producing a tribute to those halfwits. Long live the Queen.",False
11,8,"A Clip Show,",polsixe,n/a,16/08/2025,"But a pretty good one. Archival footage from 70 years showing the Queen in various contextual chapters. Some tongue in cheek humour from comedy shows and wistful, clever sounds and music clip overdubs put together in a respectful manner. God Save the Queen!",False

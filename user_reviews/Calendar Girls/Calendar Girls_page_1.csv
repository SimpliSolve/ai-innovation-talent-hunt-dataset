1,5,Who is it for.,kermithh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just watched the documentary here in Sweden on SVTPlay. I was really hoping to get a cozy and nostalgic feeling and a personal portrait of the characters involved. Unfortunately this didn't reach that stage. Maybe because it was too short and a lot of things has to be squeezed into 60 minutes. It felt more, to me, like a part of a coverage on the evening news.The documentary follows a group of elderly women that perform dances to playback music in mostly elderly facilities. I've never got to know if they come from different walks of life or what they have done earlier in their lifes, which to me are a must in such documentaries. The result is a short film on them dancing and selling calendars to support a good cause. Only for some quick moments will you meet a person on a deeper level of her life.I honestly don't get the purpose of this documentary, it's not any revelation that there are older women that enjoy performing for an audience but I would like more inner thoughts and feelings of the characters, it would be much more interesting.",False
2,2,Not sure what the purpose of this documentary was..,wicken-79357,n/a,16/08/2025,"So I fell into this documentary called Calendar girls. I was actually looking for the movie calendar girls when this popped up. Anyway, I decided to give it a watch. I went into this with an open mind and not knowing anything about what I was about to watch. I found that these women are very caddy and think very highly of themselves. Not real talent here just a lot of hand, gestures and shimmy. I think their hearts are in the right place doing these performances to raise money for service animals for veterans. One of the main women who run the Calendar girls is very snotty and self-centered and self-absorbed. I don't think I could stand to watch this for more than 10 or 15 minutes if I was to attend one of their performances. It would serve them well to hire a real choreographer and get better costumes. But decide for yourself.",False
3,9,Fabulous,katiematthies,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fabulous is this movie and the women in it. They are all fabulous. A very empowering and touching film for women of all ages. It's not just ""fluff"" but deeply moving.",False
4,10,Heartwarming and Honest Look at Senior Women,jonesandcorealty,n/a,16/08/2025,"An incitful look at women aging - their joys, their struggles, their friendships, their community involvement. Heartwarming and honest. Everyone should see this!",False
5,10,Welcome to retirement,qggvjk,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is not just about senior women volunteering their time to dance for a cause. There's terrific stories about what senior women face as they age. The creators of this movie certainly have a bright future ahead of them. They are young people from Sweden so it is amazing to me how they found this group and imagined that this would make a movie that people might want to see. They knew exactly how to present these stories in a very real and touching way. The four main characters are so interesting, vulnerable and entertaining. It is surprising how invested one gets in these women by the end. Highly recommend!",False

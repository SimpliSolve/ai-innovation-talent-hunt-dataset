1,7,Only one thing annoyed me,Mitch_R,n/a,16/08/2025,"I liked the clips of Einstein, the stories about him, and the jokes by him. The only reason I downgraded this from 8 to 7 is because of the blatant fake laughter by some of the celebrities when they were watching clips. It didn't ruin the documentary by any means, but it was noticeable and wasn't needed to convey the humor.",False
2,7,A Great Tribute,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great tribute to a very special comedian. Known as Super Dave, Marty Funkhouser, or Bob Einstein. He had a unique style which spanned multiple decades. Bob worked with and is remembered in this by many famous people, including Steve Martin, Rob Reiner, Jimmy Kimmel, Larry David and more. The clips in this tribute are aged but still funny as hell. I recommend this if you like him, or never heard of him.",False
3,10,Wonderful Tribute to Super Dave,indyj1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a wonderful tribute to the memory and career of such a unique performer and gave great insight into how far back and important he was on the comedy industry. I don't understand the reviews condemning the fact that other comedians told the straight up story of how Bob was. Based on what they all said he wouldn't have wanted it told with fluff, but instead as honestly as they stated. My only issue with the film was that I wish it were longer. While there probably wasn't that much more to say about his career, all the clips from his Super Dave stunts on ""Bizarre"" had me longing to revisit them all again.",False
4,9,A Perfect Remembrance,cpclemens,n/a,16/08/2025,"Between the old clips and the modern commentary of Bob Einstein's peers, this documentary is a perfect remembrance of his genius. It isn't just a great story about his life and who he was, but it's also incredibly entertaining. Easily watchable more than once.",False
5,5,"Too many laughing head ""tributes""",inframan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved Bob Einstein/Super Dave Osborne. Loved every clip of his priceless routines/wit. This whole ""documentary"" (which has some great Super-Dave bits in it) is almost undone by the likes of Patton Oswalt, Sara Silverman, Kimmel, Seinfeld, etc. Every one of them filmed grinning painfully before a huge screen so we could see they are watching just what we were watching. I mean REALLY? Have we gotten that stupid??? Super Dave would have hated this thing.",False
6,5,The Wrong Kind of Tribute,blakestachel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everybody knows that the best part of comedy is analyzing why jokes are funny (yeah right). I don't believe they showed a single Bob Einstein clip without insisting on following up with an explanation for why it was funny. Insufferable is one word to describe the handling of this documentary, thanks to HBO's desire to appeal to every one of their subscribers, instead of just giving fans of Super Dave the tribute he deserved.",False
7,5,I Love Super Dave... but,MovieCriticOnline,n/a,16/08/2025,"I Love Super Dave... but this documentary kinda did him an injustice. My biggest issue was the fact that they spent a bit too much time with comedians instead of his family and there were way too many reactions to his clips, rather than just showing the clips. Why would I care if Kimmel or Silverman laugh at his old clips? Was that necessary to show?I wanted more insight into his family and more of Albert Brooks, his daughter, and grandkids. Just showing a majority of comedians rehashing Dave's old jokes/clips seemed like a total waste. It came off as just filler. They put way more focus on the people they interviewed compared to Super dave.Especially because most of the people they interviewed have a stain of political hackness to them these days which is a turnoff. Reiner, Kimmel, Silverman, Oswalt, etc embedded themselves in the last 4-5 years into politics and turned off at least 50% of the country. It's hard to take them seriously these days, unfortunately, which is why comedians shouldn't do hard politics unless it's part of some humor/joke. It's just hard for me to separate their public activism from their comedy.I still recommend it, but I wish they had cut out the superfluous reactions, etc.",False
8,5,If your idea...,bripam-84638,n/a,16/08/2025,"...of a million laughs is watching two dozen comedians stomp all over the jokes of one who's shuffled off this mortal coil, then this is the flick for you.",False

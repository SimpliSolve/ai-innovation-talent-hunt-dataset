1,2,"Dumbest ""documentary"" ever",oshkosh-30295,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis starts of as a documentary of sorts but then drifts off into sci-fi fantasy land. The last half of this ""documentary"" talks more about scientists living in futuristic floating balloon laboratories in Venus' atmosphere than any facts or actual science. This program should be classified as sci-if or fantasy not a documentary. I am a big sci-fi fan but the fantastical future fantasyland that is portrayed here in the last half of the show is although plausible in the distant future has no real foundation in fact. Unfortunately this is 50 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.....disappointed!",True
2,2,Ridiculous,jseabul,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely inane movie? So far fetched and stupid that they would try to compare Venus with earth. Venus is only 30% closer haha. So global warming did them in, too bad we all moved to earth and are causing the same thing here. What a joke to think we could live in the sky of Venus and float through the sulfur clouds without a care. The people who made this should be brought back to reality and put to work on some other project such as exploring Saturns moons or going to Alpha Centuri to rescue Will Robinson. Good luck to them.

1,6,I Would Not Have Watched This,kamille,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't know Tegan & Sara, they came along after my time. But I do love a good mystery.. as long as it is solved. While this story is interesting, I watched for one reason and one reason only: for the sheer satisfaction of seeing some ""bad guy"" get exposed, and if I'm really lucky, the perp will speak on camera to explain why they did what they did. But there was no satisfaction here. The story ended like it began, with a hacker causing havoc on people's lives.There are many master hackers who can find other hackers in a very short period of time. Why didn't they seek one out? Emails leave a trail. How can this person have contacted so many victims, sending thousands of emails, photos and music demos, for YEARS, and no one ever finds out who they are?!Documentaries such as this one, shouldn't even be made until or unless the criminal is exposed at the end. I wasted an hour and a half of my time just to hear that people's lives were upended due to someone's cruel manipulations. But.. I already knew that. I think everyone is familiar with the catfishing effect. I was waiting for the good part.. but the good part never came.. only the credits.",True
2,7,"A rather dry account of the perils of fame, but interesting.",davidpetrison,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I saw the title Fanatical: The Catfishing of Tegan and Sara, I got excited. I am not a huge fan, but I have liked them in the past enough to buy a couple CDs. I thought, ""Cool. I can hear a but about the story of the band Iand maybe hear a few songs. Maybe see them perform a bit.""Well, I sorta got what I wanted, on the former point. Die hard fans of the group will probably be fascinated and will love the band even more for what they have had to put up with. However, this is probably not going to make new listeners out of people who know nothing about the group (i.e. Everyone).. You hear a portion of ""Walking Like a Ghost"" and the first single off their next record, but that's it. The story is contained to Sara'so stories of interacting with her computer and what her family and friends thought about it all. The movie doesn't have much of a reason to extend into their life as a working band.This is not really a story about how Tegan and Sara were catfished. This Is a case of severe identity theft. Tegan's fans were the ones being catfished. The band's routine of compassionately relating with fans was taken advantage of. The band had their passport photos stolen, emails hacked into, you name it. Fans who thought they were talking to the actual band thought they were off in ways that made them angry. It turns out that you can't hang out after shows to shake hands or tell your audiences personal details of your life anymore.At 99 minutes, this is clearly too long. I am unconvinced that this couldnt be an hour long eposode of a tv show, with ad breaks. There is the show ""Catfish"" but this is different. You should probably not create a series about famous people that had their identities stolen, so I get it. That would set a bad precedent.This is a decent, chilling account of a true life story. This seems largely made for fans that want to know what was going on over the years. For essayists and YouTube content creators, it is pretty much a must-see if you are looking for a true accounts about stalking or the perils of fame. But for a movie about famously entertaining figures, this is rather bland and uninvolving.Good for fans, but in no way surprising. Look for YouTube videos or podcast episodes to quickly reference the most interesting bits.7.5/10.",False
3,7,Exposing the harm done by catfishing,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Fanatical: The Catfishing of Tegan and Sara"" (2024 release; 99 min) opens, Tegan is talking to the director about why she has decided to tell the full story about how she was the subject of catfishing and how it has affected her and the people around her and the fans. The documentary then goes to the early days in Vancouver of identical twins Tegan and Sara, and how they broke into the music scene. At this point we are 10 minutes into the film.Couple of comments: this is the latest from documentarian Erin Lee Carr (""At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal""). Here she assesses the strange tale of the catfishing of Tegan (someone else pretends to be Tegan, being a fake Tegan or Fegan as Tegan nicknames the fake her). The mere fact that this has happened is already strange. The fact that this went on for years and years is mindboggling. I should mention that I have seen Tegan and Sara 3 or 4 times in concert in the period 2008-2015, and I know who they are, but I am not a die-hard fan and this is the first time I hear of this story. Facts once again are stranger than fiction.""Fanatical: The Catfishing of Tegan and Sara"" premiered at this year's Toronto International Film Festival, and it started streaming on Hulu about 3-4 weeks ago. I just caught up with it earlier this week. If you area fan of Tegan and Sara or simply curious about catfishing, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,6,A little off,HypnoticPoison7,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've grown up with Tegan and Sara since ""I was walking with a ghost"" first came out and still listen to their heartthrob album with my husband. Together we thought we'd learn some crazy crap about Tegan and Sara, and boy was that the case. The first mistake this documentary makes is obsessively referring to Tegan and Sara and their entire fan base as q u e e r, as if that's the only label that matters. No no ladies, plenty of fans like us exist who love the music and shows and had nothing to do with that scene other than noticing song lyrics and appreciating your honesty in your music and public personas. No matter what level of importance you give it, who you're attracted to isn't what what makes you special, being honest is. That's what should have been the focus here. So I remember being a crazy teenage girl fan of lots of celebs and doing some dumb obsessive crap back in the day when no one understood Internet privacy. Typically that behavior is supposed to fade as an adult. That's why I can say it takes one to know one and Tegan should know that ""Tara"" is Fegan. They gave themselves away in their behavior around the interview, texts to the interviewer and responses to Tegan. This person doesn't see Tegan as human and is so narcissistic they sound like a complete psychopath. I mean yes it's funny that super fans were not only catfished but also allowed it to effect their lives in such a way that they were willing to be interviewed for this. And yes it's funny and a little sad that Tegan and Sara couldn't afford to hire someone to gather IP addresses and trace this stuff back better from the beginning. But ""Tara"" was really getting off on screwing with them until the very end and didn't even apologize for the behavior they did admit to doing, such as calling Tegan's girlfriend. It's still funny to them. So maybe it's not a good thing to call yourself and your fan base q u e e r all of the time, considering where that word originates from. What did you expect? My husband and I are normal fans that wouldn't have known any of this and can't understand how any of it happened, and for so long. Maybe the lesson here is that people who aren't tech savvy shouldn't be using the Internet, whether they're a celeb OR a fan.",True
5,8,Unsolved Mysteries,yesterdaysprize,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI love Tegan & Sara's music, but I'm more of a casual listener and had no idea about the catfishing.As someone who has had this happen to them in the late 90s/early 00s, it's not as rare as they made it seem. I think every fandom has probably had people impersonate them and try to talk to fans. The people who do this seem to get off on it, it makes them feel important somehow.I feel especially bad for Tegan & Sara for having to go through this, and I can't imagine the trauma it left them. I imagine it's hard for them to trust anyone after that.I wish it wasn't like an episode of Unsolved Mysteries though, I feel like with the right team of people, it could've been solved. But it's a cautionary tale as well as a true crime story about identify theft, fandoms, and obsessive fans.Worth a watch even if you're not a fan of theirs, I think.",True
6,2,Incompetence at all angles,insta-41474,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone involved in this story was just plain incompetent. This story would make more sense if they were covering up for Tegan actually stringing fans along, because everyone is just so bad at trying to figure this mystery out.The film doesn't figure out anything, and the story is sloppily edited. There's obviously more to these stories that were edited out to portray the band better. The managers who originally lost control of the online accounts and then decided to run the investigation themselves instead of hiring a professional are especially to blame. Tegan's weird manner while meeting her affected fans in the film was very off putting, with a hollow veneer of empathy used to gather more information out of them.There's a whole industry behind cybersecurity today, just hire a professional researcher instead of playing amateur detective. I feel sorry to all the fans who were affected and will continue to be affected.",False
7,10,Great documentary,tate-nova,n/a,16/08/2025,I didn't know anything about this story and was so interested the whole time and thought the editing and story telling was so good. I thought it was interesting how much the filmmaker and subject were on screen together speaking with the victims of the catfishing and help like the relationship with JT was cathartic in some way. Overall I would highly recommend watching it. What a horrible experience for band to endure and so many victims it's just so awful to imagine. Highly recommend if you enjoy documentaries or true crime. I don't have much else to say but think it was a well made film and check it out!,False
8,2,I feel catfished watching this,ceitel,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNo resolution. Tegan felt ""off"" the entire time. The whole documentary felt contrived. It seems more likely that this was a publicity stunt for a washed up band to earn a few bucks than the an actual issue that actually affected Tegan. That and/or Tegan was the real catfish trying to hide her browser history and late night chat sessions from her girlfriend and close friends -- how did fegan get her passwords to her hard drive and how was it never concerning that a small team like this is constantly leaking content and nobody wants to address such security breaches?? No real evidence of an outside perpetrator is ever shared or found and no professionals are invited to help in the investigation. This was less believable than an episode of ghost hunters.",True
9,8,WOW THIS WAS CRAZY...!,masonfisk,n/a,16/08/2025,"A current sobering doc (streaming on Hulu) on the twin sister group from the Great White North who got a shuddering reality from fandom. Knowing of the band when they first came out (I have a few of their CD's) & having watched their excellent 2022 Freevee series based on their formative high school years named appropriately High School, I was shocked & dismayed about this revelation documented here. A fan of the pair got an e-mail purporting to be Tegan which after the initial shock & skepticism the sender provided a lot of details only Tegan would know allaying the fan's fears which began a long relationship until the fan finally forwarded their exchanges to the band's manager at the time who quickly denied Teagan had any involvement w/this correspondence. The fan quickly retorted then you have a much bigger problem since she revealed there were more fans like her out there who have been duped by this person. Tegan hearing about this mobilized what or who she could to find out who the scammer was & hopefully bring them to justice but after a few years of digging (which this doc details) the best they could come up w/was a dwindling list of possibles w/the last moments an audio conversation between Tegan, the filmmaker Erin Lee Carr & the accused w/no real frustrating closure to be had. If you have seen the show & the original doc Catfishing, any person who hasn't had this happen to them gets an awful pit in their stomach realizing how low a person would stoop to upend a stranger's life for no apparent reason then you can't help but empathize w/Tegan's plight which by film's end still has not been resolved.",False
10,9,Biased Review - I'm a T&S Fan,shramana108,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary wasn't perfect, the conclusion was somewhat lacking (though there was a lot of emotional and intrapersonal progress made, which was satisfying).To be fair, the movie is called ""Fanatical"", and it's a documenting of a prolonged series of catfishing incidents - the intent isn't necessarily to solve the mystery, it's a history and exploration of ""fans"" and their effects on the targets of their affection, as well as each other.The music (score) was also very good, somewhat Shane-Carruth-y (RIP, or actually maybe not).Also - the emotional maturity of everyone on T&S's team, and Tegan especially (as the main subject of the film), was astounding. I am not emotionally mature, or articulate, or intelligent. And the prowess of these people, their ability to communicate and empathize blows me away.As a fan, and the reason I decided to write this review, I love that every time Tegan had a costume change in the interviews they had to reintroduce her with her name punched up on the screen. I forget that some people can't tell the difference between Sara and Tegan. And then I realized how many people will watch this who haven't listened to Tegan and Sara - and that made me happy.They're very good people. Sucks this happened.Good documentary, but I wish it didn't have to be made. Internet people can be jerks.",True

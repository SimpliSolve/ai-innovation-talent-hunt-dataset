1,5,Negative Reviews are from Cultists,Echo4Victor,n/a,16/08/2025,"A lot of butt-hurt negative reviews from Christian Nationalists here. If someone is simply a Christian, they would not feel attacked by this documentary and recognize the clear and present danger that Nationalism is to their faith and to a secular democratic republic. The documentary does a great job highlighting exactly how (white) Christian Nationalism is an insidious danger and fast-tracking our way to an authoritarian theocracy. Recent Current Events make this film timely and necessary. Multiple experts interviewed in the film did a great job emphasizing that Christian Nationalism is NOT Christian. My hope is that this film will reach indecisive voters (MAGA is too far gone)",False
2,10,EXCELLENT!!,shintochick,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a necessary and important documentary. The participants are Christian Evangelical historians, pastors, and authors that explain the history of Christian Nationalism and how it currently affects the democracy of the United States. It shows us what Christian Nationalists believe, who they hate, what they want the country to look like, and how they want to get there using their own words. The footage of them talking about Trump and 1/6 is chilling. People of any faith and those without should watch this and take the words, actions, and beliefs very seriously. They want to dismantle democracy.",False
3,10,Scary times,sailingnc,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a timely and well done documentary. It's unfortunate that the same people who believe in Christian Nationalism are also the people who believe every conspiracy theory and Qanon. There are many reasons those circles overlap. Hopefully more people will watch this film. I do wish it was free though. More people would watch it and it is needed.Christians that have mixed politics and power with Jesus need to examine why they need a country so fascist that everyone else is required to believe and act as the Christians require.Abortion was not a protestant issue until the unholy marriage of the televangelist and corporations needed to pull the right under just a few ideas. It was a Catholic issue and belief that the Mother has little value.Christian Nationalism is the antithesis of what the Deist founding Father's envisioned when they left the toil and strife of religious turmoil behind on the shores of Europe.Love how the trolls that rated the documentary low...many have not watched it. They are afraid it may shake their belief system to its core by challenging the worst aspects of its tenants.Are all Christians bad? No. Are all Christian Nationalist bed for this country? Yes.,False
4,10,Reality check,alias_guests_p,n/a,16/08/2025,"Uncovers the origins of Christian Nationalism and where it sits during the polarized political climate America sits in today. As someone who grew up in a southern Baptist church, I found it helpful to see where this political ideology stemmed from in comparison to my own experiences growing up and now as an adult. Prior to viewing, I already felt the conflation of Christian Nationalism with Christianity is a threat to both democracy and my core religious beliefs - it was refreshing to see I am not going crazy with what is happening. Overall, the documentary had me going back to my Bible to re-assess the teachings of Jesus, and take Christianity back to the gospels/away from politics.",False
5,10,The dangers of mixing religion with politics,Freethinker_Atheist,n/a,16/08/2025,"It doesn't take a genius to realize that Christian Nationalism (like any other religious nationalism, for example in Iran) is dangerous, because almost nothing can be more dangerous for a country than when it's ruled by people who are 100% convinced that they were chosen by none other than the Creator of the Universe himself to fix the world. And fixing the world means forcing their religion on all people. Christian nationalists believe in an angry, vengeful god who does not tolerate dissent and is eager to punish Humanity. Since God is not here to personally do it, his followers will do his job for him. Christian nationalists want to placate the wrath of their god, by imposing his will, which, in the case of this deity, is written in a heap of copies of rags of parchments from the Iron Age, with myths also from the Bronze Age.I recommend the book ""Liberated from Religion"", by Paulo Bitencourt, which brilliantly exposes this great danger.",False
6,8,"A must Watch, absolutely terrifying documentary",Bmore-Hero,n/a,16/08/2025,"""God & Country"" is a stirring and thought-provoking documentary that dives deep into the complex relationship between faith, nationalism, and politics in contemporary America. The film offers a nuanced exploration of how religious beliefs shape public life and political ideologies, striking a delicate balance between different viewpoints without becoming preachy or overly partisan.One of the most unsettling aspects of the documentary is its unflinching portrayal of Christian nationalism, a movement that seeks to merge American identity with a particular brand of Christianity in ways that are both exclusionary and authoritarian. The film captures how terrifying this ideology can be, as it fuses faith with political power to push a vision of the country that marginalizes religious and cultural diversity. The documentary highlights the potential dangers of this movement to democracy itself, as it seeks to reshape the country according to a narrow, rigid set of beliefs-often to the detriment of civil liberties and the separation of church and state.""God & Country"" makes it clear that Christian nationalism isn't just a fringe movement, but a rising force that has captured significant political momentum. The film features voices from within the movement itself as well as those who are pushing back against it, showing that this isn't just a philosophical debate but a real and urgent political battle.The documentary calls on viewers to recognize the threat posed by this ideology and to fight back through civic engagement, education, and activism. The message is clear: safeguarding the future of a pluralistic, democratic society requires vigilance and action against efforts to impose religious dominance in the public sphere.Visually, the documentary is beautifully shot, with captivating footage of religious ceremonies, political rallies, and everyday American life. The score is subtle but effective, adding emotional weight to the film without overwhelming its message. The editing is sharp, and the narrative flows well, keeping viewers engaged throughout its runtime.However, ""God & Country"" occasionally falters in its pacing, particularly during the middle act, where some segments feel a bit repetitive. Additionally, while the film does an excellent job of capturing the current moment, it could have delved deeper into the historical context that has shaped the intersection of religion and politics in America today. A bit more historical grounding would have provided additional layers of depth.Overall, ""God & Country"" is a compelling documentary that sheds light on one of the most pressing issues of our time. It's a must-watch for anyone interested in understanding the complexities of American society, especially in an era where faith and politics are increasingly intertwined. Though not flawless, it is a powerful and necessary film that will leave viewers reflecting on their own beliefs and the future of the country.",False
7,10,DON'T BELIEVE THE TROLL REVIEWS,xyxkyns,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great movie that is very insightful and comprehensive as it shows us the breadth and depth of white Christian nationalism. It is fast-paced and with the highest production values. The low reviews by alt-right trolls prove the point of the movie! This movie will help all of us see the danger of the toxic mix of political theocratic extremism and big-money organizations that do not want democracy to flourish. The betrayal by the Trumpists of the founding principles of our country is done by falsifying our history. The many voices in this movie are virtually all from conservative evangelicals. When ""Bob the tomato"" says something is unChristian, we have to listen!",False
8,10,Excellent thought piece,catesalim,n/a,16/08/2025,I've been seeing the rise of Christian nationalism for a while and as a Christian it's frightening. This documentary gives tremendous insight into the start and how we've gotten to where we are today. The fact that the majority of individuals presented the information are also Christian speaks volumes.I strongly encourage others to watch this and educate themselves. The fact that the rating is so low is a sign that this film should be seen - there are powerful people who don't want us to be educated to what is going on in this country.Watch this and judge for yourself. Education and reason are mportant and not to be feared.,False
9,4,Message From Inside the Bubble,strumdatjag,n/a,16/08/2025,"This from an atheist who has given good reviews to films by Michael Moore and has never given a good review to a film by D'Nesh D'Souza (OK - I only saw one of his films and can't spell his name).Nevertheless, propoganda like this has to either inform us of something new or be funny (like Michael Moore), emotionally moving, or something with a soul.This film, however, just looks more like a hatchet job, or it could be an attempt at a freak show. Maybe some viewers will like the political validation experience (that's about all it could be), but a movie length documentary needs more to justify a ruining time longer than 10 minutes. Sorry, but this gets 4/10, failing but not monumentally bad.",False

11,10,Needed Information on the Misalignment of Christian Principles,kwyant-14064,n/a,16/08/2025,"Starting in February or March of 2021, I started learning about Christian nationalism from connections on Twitter and seeing horrendous videos from Christian nationalists, so I read several books and watched videos on the topic. This documentary still showed me additional chilling details about this movement. I especially appreciate the information Rob Schenck, the Bonhoeffer Institute director, provided. I appreciate that most of those interviewed are Christian scholars who mourn the corruption of our faith. For a non-believer, director Dan Parkland shows Christians trying to follow Christ in a positive light.",False
12,9,Important film,david-haspel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stewart's book is must read! The film deviates from the book in it importantly examines the effect negative effect Christian nationalism has on Christianity. While this is very important, thought more focus on the impact to democracy. Woukd have be valuable to those wanting to learn more about this movement. That said the thoughts of David French and Russel Moore are important to understanding the film does a good job with the difficult job of revealing the disguise of Christian nationalism'a use of religion to organize a political movement. If you are a fan of the Orange Jesus you will hate this film. If you are confused by how so many devout Evangelicals could support OJ this will help provide a perspective.",False
13,10,An Important Documentary that Shines a Spotlight on Christian Nationalism,satanistsnextdoor,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary helps to show what is happening in America, and other places around the world. Christian Nationalism is a virus that is infecting our country from political leaders, to churches, and schools. It's not new, but it's picked up momentum lately because people are drawn towards hate and anger. It divides families and our country. If someone is already indoctrinated into Christian Nationalism they will likely hate this film, but if you can catch someone before they are fully indoctrinated you might just save them.Christian Nationalism has nothing to do with Jesus or his words, but is all about power and creating a Theocracy. I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to the screening of this movie, but I was happily surprised by how well they captured it, and the caliber of people interviewed to speak on the subject of Christian NationalismIf you don't know what Christian Nationalism is, I highly recommend watching this to help you identify what is happening around us in 2024. The history of we got here and were we're going if this movement isn't stopped.Have an open mind and be honest with yourself.",False
14,10,A must see for any sane American.,sarahthetops,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well well well, look at all of the scared little trolls who had to review bomb this film just to cope. Really speaks volumes about what their intentions for this country are. As you'll see in this documentary, these people very literally want life to cease for those that disagree with them in the slightest. You will see Christian fanatics brandishing automatic rifles while holding a flag bearing ""JESUS"" attempting to stage a coup and chanting what they'd like to see happen to everyone in their way. You'll listen to preachers praying for the destruction of their ""enemies"" and asking God to make the suffering violent. Oh, and those are the actions of actual elected officials still currently in office. They will stop at nothing to establish a theocratic dictatorship under Trump.It's a chilling film that every sane American needs to watch. ""There is no hate like Christian love.""",False
15,9,Dangers of Christian Theocracy,elgreer,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is about the dangers of Christian Nationalism, which isn't Biblical at all, but a political movement to gain more power than Christians already have, at the expense of multiculturalism and other religions (or no religion at all).For those Christians who have negatively reviewed this documentary based on its content, I have two questions. 1. Do you believe that Trump actually won the 2020 election? 2. And did you want to ""stop the steal?"" If the answer to those questions is yes, then you are part of the problem this film illustrates. Please try to view it with an open mind. Matthew 7:3-5.",False
16,2,Snoozefest filled with attacks on a certain religion. Don't waste your time.,0x0000000078,n/a,16/08/2025,"Probably the worst documentary I've ever seen. Don't waste your time on this one. Anyone who rates a film 10 stars obviously never watched it or are part of the crew who produced the film trying to inflate the rating. Even if someone actually liked this documentary, a legitimate review would be 6 or 7 stars. I gave this 2 stars. 1 because it really is the worst film I ever seen and another 1 for effort. Nice try, but they obviously didn't do their homework when making this garbage. Whoever made this should probably retire and never waste their time producing another useless film.By the way, I'm not religious but attacks on someone else's religion is disgusting.",False
17,10,Exposure,dangshaynadang,n/a,16/08/2025,"Religion is the leading cause of all wars.Faith does not require exclusion and hate.We were all born atheists. Your neighbor just believes in a different god than you. Or maybe one less.What I enjoyed most about this film was the history of past extremism and the war/divide it brought upon people.I do wish it would have dived deeper into the funneling of taxless religious cash.Money does not lie. Follow the tax free church money, right into our government.Our children deserve us to watch these films of information. To view the world outside of a tunnel; Outside of the echo chamber held in your hands.And our government deserves the eyes of a plural nation... Not a hand picked religious fascist one.",False
18,10,"Apparently, some people have their heads in the sand",ChrisMIN43211,n/a,16/08/2025,"God & Country, the documentary about the unfortunate integration of religion, politics, and a little bit of fanaticism in the last five decades, it shows some uncomfortable truths, up to and including January 6th, 2021. One review by a naysayer wants to claim the ""users giving a 10/10"" haven't seen the movie. To which I ask, what were YOU watching? Without giving too much away, parallels to the past- in American and world history- of other movements and actions ""in the name of God"" are given just enough focus. All because some people are under the impression that their religious freedoms will be taken away. The phrase ""No hate like Christian love"" certainly applies.",False
19,8,Agree with the points but needed more structure,johnnymonsarrat,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely support the points of this film, but it meanders. The viewer needs more milestones and takeaways.I suppose the lack of a narrator is an attempt by the filmmakers to stand back and let the film speak for itself, but the viewer can easily get lost. I say this as someone who was NOT lost but only because I'm a topic expert, having worked for separation of church and state.Ultimately, who is the audience for this? The film is too hard hitting to convince religious people, and it's not accessible enough to draw in new secular people.So I'll give a 10 for the topic, but dial it down to 8 for the actual impact of this film.",False
20,n/a,Religiophobia,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this film today and struggling to understand what the point was other than to attempt to paint one of the many US religions as a threat. If I had made a film about how Judaism or Islam is a threat to the US, I would be appropriately scolded. Hollywood is only furthering the divide of this country with this filmI enjoy a good documentary that is fact based, non political and unbiased. However, this film feels to paint a picture that attacks a religious group on certain values. Good documentaries that I have seen before will support both sides of a subjective topic. This film fails to accomplish that.Can we please stop making extremely polarizing films, films with agendas and just focus on quality?",False
21,1,Insidious and misleading,mde-51078,n/a,16/08/2025,"The people behind this documentary clearly do not understand Christian doctrine or who every day Christian's actually are or what they actually think. It's a propaganda piece that comes in the year leading up to an election, go figure. It's a typical situation where you find a group to demonize and make into a scary enemy in order to achieve your political aims. The fact that someone as hyper-political and openly hostile toward Ron Reiner made the film isn't a big shock. This documentary features clips of John MacArthur, who is as main stream a Christian pastor as it gets. If you like to hate other people for their religion and/or for being different, while having no real understanding of what they actually believe or think, then this is the documentary for you.",False
22,10,Time will Tell,karen-loethen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm watching ""God & Country"" on Tubi. It's a show about Christian Nationalism.I'll be honest, it's terrifying how any sort of Christianity has morphed into this political machinery. Christianity is no longer about the belief system and the value of the religion, but is now about power and politics. The amount of money spent on revving people up to a political fervor is terrifying.Is Christian Nationalism Christian?I don't think so. It's not based on the values of the gospels or the culture of Christianity.There is no way you can look at what is going on and call is Christian. Humanity is in danger because of this movement.And it is all based on myths and disinformation.I'm convinced that most people who are swept up in the fervor will regret their actions very soon as our nation falls into decay and absolute craziness, all kinds of things that have nothing to do with religion or their belief system and everything to do with oligarchical power. I'm certain that some people are finally beginning to see the error of their ways.",False
23,10,I Hate This Film; I Love This Film,dtporter-886-883020,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hate this movie. I love this movie. As a pro-life Democrat, I love this movie. As a documentary, I hate this movie. I am incensed by seeing how Christians have poisoned the gospel of Jesus the Christ. I am angry at how the Christ will be vilified by the toxicity of Christian Nationalism. I am so disappointed we still have not learned from our far past in the Crusades and the recent past in Nazi Germany.As a pro-life Christian, I resent politicians seducing Christians to equate trying to provide for unwelcome births with voting for a felon who mocks a Pope, who wonders if he has to follow the Constitution. As a social liberal, I resent Christians turning the gospel of love and inclusion into a vendetta of retribution for hyped up slights by immigrants, legal or otherwise. As a libertine, I also resent this government pushing one religious agenda, even if Christianity is my approach to understanding the Lord God.Reiner & Reiner and Stewart and other producers have pushed the envelope. They have covered the subject well. Partland's direction was superior. Great selection of commentators. I would have loved, however, to see a serious apologist for Christian Nationalism interviewed, one on one, by a seasoned journalist like Stewart. Sunshine can sterilize.Perhaps the biggest problem of Christian Nationalism is illustrated by the IMDB ratings for this documentary. They are bi-modal, lots of 1's and 10's reflecting the political and spiritual polarization of our country. Compromise has become a dirty word. ""They"" has become the ultimate enemy attribute. So much for loving our enemies; we can't even love ""them.""",False
24,1,Pathetically unfair propaganda,NinjaLandXPOnYoutube,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watch a lot of documentaries, this is the worst kind.A one sided talking heads piece where they tell you what to believe then show random clips which have nothing to prove in what the person just said.It's a total joke!Plainly to see it's propaganda that came out in an election year to scare people into voting a certain way.Never even speaks to someone who claims to be a Christian Nationalist, so the whole thing is literally a one sided grill fest, going after a strawman argument. Fake and made up outrage.It argues the religious groups scare people into voting for things, while doing the exact same thing in this doc. Quite hilarious lack of self awareness.Extremism is not a smart way to go on either side, the doc. Does acknowledge that only a tiny number of people even believe this extreme stuff, but then try's to freak out the viewer by showing random clips of people that aren't even Christian nationalist.Well after reading my review you won't be able to UN see how lame the doc try's to place it's viewpoint into your head, don't think it will work one bit.Poorly put together, nice propaganda attempt for either a job resume at cnn or msnbc, lol.",False

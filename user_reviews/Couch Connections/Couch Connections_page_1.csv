1,9,I was smiling like a little kid while watching the movie!,dionysiosvalis,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was such an amazing emotional journey. I really feel the need to thank all of those people that took part in such an amazing experience. Filming this must have been both challenging and awkward at times but the result was really worth it. It was such a refreshing film, full of spontaneity, good vibes and exciting moments. It brought happy tears to my eyes and made me realise how much more there is to this world. Also there is so much good out there, people with great hearts always willing to share their homes and become a part of something bigger. Indeed ""faith in humanity has been restored"". Well done and thank you!",False
2,10,"Fun, raw and kind",lamppika,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well, im not a big fun of documentaries but this was undoubtedly very fun and heartwarming 1hour and 12mins. I liked Christophs vision showing the different approaches of different hosts towards the guests. Basically i realized that every culture like people has ""personality"" itself. Best of lucks to him. Hope he will make more films with interesting stories.
Thanks",False

4,8,Inspirational and genuine,studioginger,n/a,15/08/2025,"Christopher has definitely accomplished something amazing, this documentary is definitely worth watching, said so, it's a bit missing the point how going from one place to another without much content and story, what I like the most is his point of view what it is lacking the most is the story about his prospects.. I mean what does make him choose the next couch and what is the cultural differences between him and what he lives, overall a positive documentary! Well done Christopher!!!",False
5,10,What CS is all about,kaelgole,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been in CS since 2011 and this documentary clearly shows what the site is about: sharing with others no matter how small your gesture may seem.
It made me remember some really nice moments and other weird ones. Besides, it awakened my adventure spirit once again in this crazy 2020 where travelling has not been an option.",False

8,10,Great film!,amazarakos,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film reignited my passion for Couchsurfing & travel & reconnecting with friends abroad. Many of the experiences portrayed by hosts & travelers mirrored my own. As a longtime member of the Couchsurfing community, I can attest that it's an accurate portrayal. It's a reminder that we all need to seek common ground & try to understand each other.",False

11,10,A great movie to experience the couchsurfing spirit,nadineriel,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watching this movie was 75minutes of pure happiness!It shows that travelling is not just seeing amazing places,it's more about meeting new people & making connections that last a lifetime. All the people I met left something behind, taught me something or showed me a totally different perspective of life.Finding things in common with people you thought previously you had very, very little in common with & having deep connections & conversations with someone who was a stranger a few hours before or having the feeling that you're speaking the same language..those moments are priceless & that's why I love couchsurfing & he did a great work showing all this in his documentary!!",False
12,10,A genuine + inspirational documentary. A must watch.,fanizzialessandra,n/a,15/08/2025,"""My mom always said -don't talk to strangers-""
Yes, everyone can relate to this parental advice.
Yes, this is (also) true.
But this documentary breaks these familiar words into million pieces.
Couch Connections is an incredibile documentary directed, filmed, written and edited by an amazing human being, Christoph Pehofer, who genuinely captured my attention from the title of this doc. And just got me glued on the screen until the end.
I still didn't have the chance to experience Couchsurfing yet, but as a traveller with a curious mind and open heart, I will definitely do it soon.With his genuine smile, big curious eyes and soul + open mind and heart, Christoph travelled for a 9-months trip around the world, showing the most beautiful landscapes, and thanks to Couchsurfing, he focused on the most incredible landscape of all: the humanity of a perfect stranger who welcomes a person like him into his/her private space and shows the beauty of a different culture, the beauty of inter:connections.
What makes Couch Connections wonderful is the genuine will to show the true colours of the world, highlighting on equality, sharing of experiences, exchange + blend of cultural backgrounds, establishment of new connections and friendships.
What a simple couch can do!
Yes, those mum's words are still and will always be valid, but Christoph's adventures from nation to nation show how powerful and life-changing is to take a leap into the beautiful unknown, just one small step out of comfort zone and stupid prejudices.
To paint the real meaning of humanity and equality with the most fantastic colours, just by using the colour hues that belong to the heart.Thank you Christoph Pehofer, you got me very emotional!
In times like these, we need more people like him. We need more humanity, more heart because we are all inter:connected.
Christoph, you got me emotional especially with this closing thought: ""...It is openness that gives you the key to open doors around the world"".
So deep, so intense.Whoever is reading my words, please watch this brilliant documentary.
Let's travel. More and more.
Let's be open to sharing new experiences (always remembering mum's words).
Let's break down barriers.
Let's embrace the beauty of diversity and transforming it into the synonymous of equality.
Let's built new bridges of inter:connection.
Let's go (back) to human.A.",False

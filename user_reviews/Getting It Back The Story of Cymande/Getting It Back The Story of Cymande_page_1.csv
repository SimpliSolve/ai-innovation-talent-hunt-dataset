1,8,back again for the first time,ferguson-6,n/a,17/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Discovering a new band that plays the kind of music you love is exhilarating. But what if that band has been around for years? And what if the bands you listen to were heavily influenced by this mystery band ... and may have even sampled their work in songs? Tim MacKenzie-Smith profiles ""the greatest band you've never heard of"" with this documentary on the 1970's British funk band, Cymande.Where are they from? Where did they go? Why weren't they more successful? All good questions that MacKenzie-Smith tackles with help from Cymande superfans like producer Mark Ronson and My Morning Jacket's Jim Jones, the latter who describes his love of the Fugees ""The Score"" in which they sample Cymande's ""Dove"". It's this and other examples that allow us to discover the band's influence on the beginning stages of hip-hop. It also helps makes sense of an included quote, ""some music is bigger than music.""
With most early band members hailing from the West Indies, they were never accepted in the U. K., and discrimination and racism clearly played a part in blocking their success. The band did find more popularity in the U. S. thanks to their fresh and original music, but one of the band members admit they were beaten down by the system. MacKenzie-Smith includes many interviews with band members, most of whom are now in their 70's. They come across as likable guys carrying almost no bitterness.Of course, Cymande should be well-known for their contributions and influence over the years, and the film features much of their music, as well as clips from live performances. It's a smooth groove with a fantastic bass line, and it's the music itself that helps us understand how it contributed to club and dance music of the 1980's and 90's. The film made the festival rounds in 2022 and is now getting a limited theatrical release in conjunction with the band re-forming and touring. Perhaps that lucky break is finally happening all these years later, but regardless, these guys will be playing music ... as it should be.",False
2,10,What a journey: introducing Cymande,clare-i-kelly,n/a,17/08/2025,"I was fortunate enough to see an early screening of this film at Streatham Free Film festival, which was the perfect setting as several band members hail from south London (Balham and Catford I believe).It's really well produced. Although there are underlying political themes about racism in the UK, particularly how the music industry turned a blind eye to black talent in the 70s, the overall tone is a huge celebration of the intensely powerful music that these guys produced that's been sampled well over a hundred times by huge artists over the past fifty years.If you haven't heard of them before, go look them up, share their music, and keep the legacy alive.",False

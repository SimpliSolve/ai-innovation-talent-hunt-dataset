1,10,Truth about Lyme Disease finally!!!!,rachelcolemanitds,n/a,16/08/2025,"My husband went misdiagnosed for 20 years due to the lack of information or turning of heads in the medical field. He experienced heart problems, joint pain, neurological effects like neuropathy, brain fod, sleeping trouble, depression and anxiety to just name a few. Some doctors said it was in his head and some just pushed him to another specialist. WAKE UP AMERICA!!! Lyme Disease is big and it's patients are HERE ready to let you know the ignorance and lack of recognition in care is astounding for this country. We are SO THANKFUL that a friend led us to a Lyme literate doctor who helped my husband immensely and gave him his life back. Lyme will most likely be there always but he has quality of life and can play with our children again and work regularly! He was never treated initially because it wasn't caught by anyone and on his 40th birthday diagnosed as CDC positive for Lyme disease ....still CDC never called and recognized his case. Lyme is being swept under the rug with the bones and fragments of it's patients left behind. Awareness, support, recognition as a real disease and funding are all millions with Lyme desire. IT is EVERYWHERE in America! This film is AMAZING and brought to light the true struggle many who don't have Lyme may not realize goes on. It is factual, a dark and hard reality at times, shows the true frustration of many with the medical community, highlights different Lyme literate drs and treatments and also shows THE HOPE and support we can give each other. What a beautiful picture and full circle for the Lyme community.",False
2,10,Lyme awareness is crucial,pwissman-14812,n/a,16/08/2025,Lyme is a incredibly horrible infection that ruins many lives. My life has been on a gradual downhill spiral because of the disease. I am active duty military and doctors here don't know enough about Lyme and dismiss the idea rather quickly. I am stationed overseas so it's nearly impossible to find a knowledgeable doctor. I suffer extremely badly and all I can do is take life day by day. I hope this documentary gains traction and that people learn a thing or two.,False
3,10,Finally a valid film on Lyme disease,ryrtpk,n/a,16/08/2025,It's ripped my life apart for the past 11 years it's inhumane to leave us all suffering with this infection. Thanks to the producers of this movie for shedding light onto a hidden pandemic.,False
4,n/a,I have Lyme Bartonella and Babesiosis Great Movie,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been dealing with Lyme, Bartonella and Babesiosis since 2010. This movie resonated with me. My wife is my caretaker and this made both of us closer together seeing how others support each other. This movie needs to be seen by everyone especially Politicians..it made me cry with thankfulness that the truth is finally coming out!",False
5,10,A Powerful Account of The Realities of Living With Lyme,adriennevolpe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having lived with Lyme for 30 years, I cannot believe how true, real and brutally honest this film was.Anyone with friends and family who doesn't understand their suffering will want to show the movie to them.People diagnosed with autoimmune conditions or diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or MS, may want to test for Lyme.This film is a must see for anyone suffering with chronic illness.",False
6,10,Amazing!,ldameron-38631,n/a,16/08/2025,I am a Chronic Lyme suffer of more than 30 years. This film has given me so much hope. Hope that awareness of this terrible disease will spread. Hope that doctors start to recognize the tell tale symptoms of Lyme. It also gave me validation. Validation that I'm not alone. That I'm not crazy.... I'm beyond grateful for this movie and hope that everyone gets an opportunity to watch it. It could literally save lives! üíöüôèüèº Thank you to all involved!,False
7,9,Important movie,piabjerre,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such an important movie. This cannot go on. Lyme patients worldwide do not only suffer physically. We suffer emotionally from abuse, discrimination, isolation, violent interpretation an trauma from it all. Politicians and the medical community needs to be aware what's going on.Thank you for making this film!",False
8,10,Powerful Documentary,abeejay-46069,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is so incredibly powerful! My mother passed away after enduring years of Lyme without the proper treatment. She was constantly dismissed because ""There's no Lyme disease in California.""I too have Lyme, and it's been the hardest thing I've ever gone through. I went from being a collegiate athlete and avid Crossfitter to suddenly being exercise intolerant. It took me 5 years and many doctors telling me it was all in my head, ""Here's an anti-depressant,"" to be properly diagnosed. I took the base knowledge I had from my mom's case and built on it through pure stubbornness and determination to get well. I still have work to do, but I'm much better. This documentary is a must watch for everyone! So many people are sick with no answers and many misdiagnoses. This information needs to spread like a wildfire. I literally cried at the end. I felt so validated and encouraged to share my story.If you're sick with Lyme, please look into genetics, primarily MTHFR (so your body can properly detox), and heavy metals (play a huge part in biofilm). Addressing these two things is critical as they play a huge part in the illness.",False
9,9,Very truthful and heartfelt-emotional,conradhahn,n/a,16/08/2025,As a lyme disease sufferer this movie was emotional but it also gave me hope for the future. Probably the best thing about the movie is having your friends and family watch it. It helps them realize what you are going through but also is not submissive of what THEY have and are going there along with you. This movie needs to be seen by as many folks as possible. I only gave it 9 stars because it is slightly longer than i think it should be and if you are not intimately invested in Lyme you may turn away before finishing the movie. I am thinking of my teenage kids here. I do want to thank the makers of this film from the bottom of my heavy heart. So glad tgat you guys have made it through the storm and have given us who are still suffering hope. Thank you :),False
10,10,THANK YOU!! üíö,meesymossor,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel less alone and validated.üíö The world can finally see what most of us are forced to hide.üíö I'm so very tired of living the Lyme- life, but giving up will never be an option.üíö",False
11,10,Finally!,klmnorton,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally, a film with all the info, data & testimonies you need in one place! I learned a few new stats, but mainly, this is the perfect film for sharing with friends, family & doubters. You did a fantastic job sharing your personal journey. It all resonated with me so very deeply. I thank you for the promo code as, like so many others with lyme, my funds are scant. I am happy to give this review because, I now have a huge new tool in my toolbox. I firmly agree that a positive mindset is absolutely necessary to carry on despite any setbacks you may and WILL encounter. Keep getting back on that horse. Loved your work. Thank you.",False
12,9,A much needed message of hope and so much more.,nannyshel-52287,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an important film I wish everyone would take the time to watch. This needs to be shared far and wide. Well rounded information although I do wish it touched a bit more on the astronomical cost of treatment, the importance of detoxing, the troubles some encounter with detoxing and other obstacles such as mold that for some, are also an issue that is often missed. This gave me hope however and the film was well laid out with a lot of very important layers of information that many are unaware of. I'm a warrior battling this since 2014 who was misdiagnosed for almost 3 years who's motto is and will always be, never give up.",False
13,7,Good film!,bauman-14128,n/a,16/08/2025,"In my opinion, this film is very informative in a aspects of Lyme disease that were talked about. It is a great idea to show this to a spouse who you are trying to get to understand how you may be feeling. Although, I feel that it hasn't covered all the horrific issues that Lyme causes. It destroys everything. I did IV treatment for 2 years and I was literally fighting for my life every day. It has cost us about 100k. So there are many more aspects of Lyme but the film gave good informative information about the topics that it cover. Overall, I did really enjoy watching this and I definitely recommend it.",False
14,5,This is a good film for the partners & caretakers of the Lyme sufferer.,solarianika,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film is a good beginning education regarding the neurodegenerative effects of Lyme disease and the subsequent co-infections.For actual Lyme sufferers, it is cathartic in that it validates that we are not alone in the symptoms of this invisible illness, but it is also hard to watch, as the vast majority of us don't have the steadfast loving partner, family member or friend who is willing to do all of the research, dole out all the medicines and forgive our uncontrollable moments of Lyme Rage, severe confusion and physical breakdown. As well, the vast majority of Lyme sufferers also don't have loads of cash to afford the effective and yet extremely expensive methods of treatment provided by Envita Medical Care.Therefore, in my opinion this film does not capture true Lyme disease and all its challenges but only highlights a few, which is why it is a good beginning for a new caretaker in this role or a caretaker at the brink of giving up themselves.",True
15,10,EXCELLENT documentary on Lyme disease!!!,jenaugator,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was diagnosed with Lyme disease in March 2022. Unfortunately because of Lyme disease I have lost hearing in my right ear and I am considered deaf on that side. I also have many other neurological symptoms from Lyme disease. It's easy to feel alone and very confuse fighting this disease since many doctors and people do not understand it or even recognize it. Luckily I found a wonderful ENT and infectious disease does a Doctor who helped me treat Lyme with IV antibiotics for five months. Unfortunately I didn't get my hearing back, but a lot of my other symptoms have gone away including my debilitating migraines and muscle spasms. Thank you for making this movie to help people understand how real and terrible the effects of Lyme disease are on patients and caregivers! Please keep up the good work documenting the causes and underlying issues surrounding Lyme disease, which are preventing essential research and funding.",False
16,10,Such a powerful Lyme and Co-infections Documentary,kelseyhughes-94284,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is by far the best Lyme documentary I have seen! THE WORLD NEEDS TO SEE THIS! It is extremely accurate of what the Lyme Community endures not just physically, mentally and emotionally but also financially, from the medical community, the list goes on. It hits on what we endure, the cover up of Lyme, why and the darkness having not only Lyme but more than likely a couple other co-infections pulls you into. People have no idea what we experience which is why this documentary is so important for everyone to see. Awareness is so important and so is being tested accurately especially when you have a disease that Lyme mimics and may more than likely be the underlying cause. I believe most people are walking around being treated for other things when the underlying cause is Lyme like I did for most of my life. I've had Lyme and Bartonella for over 28 years just found out in 2021 and not once was Lyme even mentioned. It angers me the crimes against humanity that are being committed all for money. This film moved me to tears. Thank you for sharing your story and making this beautifully important and extremely powerful Lyme documentary! üíö",False
17,8,Thankful For Awareness,ThatSammiiGirl,n/a,16/08/2025,"I spent most of my life sick and went over a decade misdiagnosed before finding out Lyme was the root of my health issues. I, too, was told it's all in my head, that I was too young to be as sick as I described, and that maybe some otc vitamins would help. The hopelessness and despair patients feel before finding legitimate help is very real. But so is healing. üíöThe first half of this documentary is very depressing and I almost turned it off at one point. It brought back so many emotions I experienced during my battle with chronic Lyme. The second half does rebound some with positivity and hope, but my overall take away is that it still focused more on the negative. I understand this to an extent because Lyme is such an insidious disease, however, it does take that shift in perspective and mindset to truly heal. It does take a holistic approach to healing multiple issues all at once - spiritual healing plays a huge role in overall healing. I was thankful to see this was mentioned.Overall, it was a decent documentary on Lyme. I do wish there was more time given to the healing side of the Lyme journey instead of the misery. Life after Lyme is possible. Healing is possible. Joy is possible. Change your perspective, change your life.",False
18,10,A film filled with hope and compassion.,tonifaulkner-01664,n/a,16/08/2025,Thank you for putting a voice to a silent confusing path that many are walking alone. The hope I feel after viewing this is massive. Such a beautiful film and so much amazing information in it to absorb. Following along on the different stories gave me so much insight into how each persons journey can be so different. I look forwards to your next movie. Highly recommend viewing this one whether you are dealing with Lyme of not. There are many gifts within this movie that even a healthy living non Lyme person could take away. It is so hard to find information on Lyme and this is a movie filled with so much!,False
19,10,Globally it's all the same - you don't get it until you get it regardless of what you call it,jacquiburnell-11642,n/a,16/08/2025,"Living in Australia is extremely difficult for Lyme disease as it becomes all about the label or name of the disease. Watching this American based movie showed me it doesn't matter where you are in the world, Lyme, and biting vector disease or tick borne disease is pretty much the same.Although I have been suffering in chronic Lyme stage for over 6 years now, and tried many MANY therapies in my country and abroad, this movie shows how there is not ONE cookie cutter treatment approach and there is not usually ONE issue with Lyme to deal with and Lyme will not usually disappear or be cured with just ONE round of treatmentThe movie has real patients suffering and their stories. It shows some hit remission and others are not so lucky. It importantly shows the murkiness of the political landscape in america, in particular the cdc, which has sadly a lot of influence and creates a massive ripple effect across the globe not just in America.I liked how I could save and watch the movie in short sessions to suit my symptoms. This movie will appeal to the current patients and provide some comfort in the familiarity of the struggles that go hand in hand with this disease. Equally it should be watched by friends and family (and carers of those sick), to gain more insight into the struggles we face. It's a shame chronic Lyme disease is still not accepted and easily treated in 2022 but with more education and movies like this it will continue to disrupt the bias system.",False
20,10,"Should be Required Viewing for Lyme Patients, their Loved Ones, the Medical Profession, and the CDC.",cjauer-59599,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brilliant, compassionate cinema. Here's hoping it gets Oscars. The chapter on Lyme Rage was so realistic to what my best friend and partner experienced/s. Her screaming rages were identically tragic to watch. Last I saw her all she could do is drink, cry, scream and sleep. She had so much love and life in her that this secret scourge stole from her and everyone that loves her. Everyone loved her. Huge support network. All gone now. She comes from a family of medical professionals, none of whom sympathizes, except for the one sibling who got off cheap with a mild case of it. Another sibling is a MD/Psychologist who cut ties with me for blaming the US Government and Western Medicine for allowing this scourge to ruin so many millions of lives. I am hoping the Eastern European technology of Bacteriophage Therapy, using select viruses that target the specific Lyme Bacteria a patient has, FINALLY gets USDA approval. Trials ongoing at U Cal San Diego. I literally dreamed the other night, after watching this movie, of my best friend and partner coming back to her old home someday, looking well and saying to me...""I'm better now...do you still want me?"". BTW it could have been me. The tick that bit her was in our bed. August 16, 2015.",False
21,9,A MUST WATCH,tanyadupagne,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a patient with Lyme, Bartonella, Babesia, Rickettsia, EBV and Coxsackie. The Lyme has also triggered severe Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome in my body. I live in Australia, but was bitten by the tick in New Hampshire USA while working at Summer Camp back in 2005. Lyme is not recognised in Australia, so it was swirling around my body for over 15 years before an LLMD eventually worked out what was causing my giant list of symptoms.I have been wanting to see this documentary since the previews first started coming out, as I think it is a story that needs to be told, particularly here in Australia. I went through every range of emotion watching it - I think as a patient myself, I felt it personally as I could resonate with everything that was being said. The directors hit the nail on the head. The stories told showed me that other people are going through the same thing and gave me a good sense of empathy. I was angry at all the politics that is denying people round the world access to the chance to get better, and the costs that bankrupt us as a result. I had some hope by the end because I could see some people recovered, albeit after an extremely long and hard journey.So often Lyme and all its co-infections are swept under the carpet. Doctors, Governments, medical bodies, nobody wants to talk about it. It's like if we ignore it, it'll go away. That's not going to happen. This documentary forces people to pay attention, in quite a confronting way but I think sometimes you need to say it like it is to get your point across. No point sugar coating things because for those of us living with it every day, nothing is sugar coated.I think everyone should watch it and put yourself in our shoes for a couple of hours. And be aware of the fact that this could happen to anyone, anywhere . . . It could happen to you, your family, your friends, in the space of a second. Then tell others, especially medical professionals and the powers that be to watch it, so we can get the word out there. From a selfish patient point of view, I would love to see a follow up documentary that goes more into detail of the treatment some of these patients received to make them feel better.Thank you to everyone involved with The Monster Inside Me for telling this story, and the patients who shared their journeys.",False
22,10,An honest look at Lyme,jbubolz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film so accurately depicts the day-to-day struggle of living with Lyme that it was hard for me to watch it all the way through. Lyme flipped my life upside down almost ten years ago, and I've never before seen my own battle portrayed so clearly. From the frustration of trying to get treated, to the financial devastation, to the loss of relationships, I have never felt so seen. I think anyone could benefit from seeing this film, but especially if you are a sufferer or love someone who is, it will give you an understanding of what we experience every day. Lyme can steal everything you've got, and more.",False
23,3,Short version: Meh.,lunzie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler(I saw this film at its very first screening in Harrisburg PA, on April 26, 2022.)Short version: Meh. Under Our Skin (2008) is a much better film.Long version: This film spends the vast majority of its time on ""human interest stories"", specifically the filmmaker's wife's horrific struggles with a chronic Lyme infection. There are others in the film who suffer equally, and their stories are compelling. However, there is almost zero screen time talking about regulatory capture by big pharma, or the lack of robust testing, and only very vague references to actual treatment plans. (I like my science-y movies to have, well, lots of science in them.)There is a couple who has an autistic son who see salvation in a long-term Lyme treatment, but we never see them or their son after their initial interview. Did they pursue the treatment? Did it help? We'll never know.The listing here on IMDB is also very misleading: all those famous people? Yeah, they hardly have any screen time at all, and don't speak in the seconds allotted to them, since they appear in clips from other sources.Overall, I was not impressed and mostly annoyed with the choppy narrative and loose ends. There was only mild applause at the film's conclusion.",True
24,10,So Encouraging!,mandikaake,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fellow Lyme sufferer here. I was bit multiple times as a child before I hit my teen years. I was sick on and off a lot as a child. I had horrible wrist and knee pain that couldn't be diagnosed. So many things. It wasn't until 19 years ago that my symptoms started to get progressively worse. The symptoms are too many to list. I knew I was sick and sought help from doctors, herbalists, d.o.'s, etc... No one could find anything wrong and I got the typical, ""you're under a lot of stress"", or ""your depressed because of your current situation"". It wasn't until my mid-30's that I got diagnosed with Lyme disease. There was no marital support, no family support and barely any support from friends at that time. I felt so alone and was so harshly judged. I now surround myself with people who believe and encourage me. My son recently got diagnosed with lyme. I'm so thankful for my journey because it led to a much quicker diagnosis with an LLMD for him. This has been so good for me to watch and once again remember we are not alone. It's so very true that everything down to mindset helps lead to a healthier path when dealing with lyme. My therapist told me something before I was diagnosed that helped tremendously! He told me to be my best self spiritually, emotionally and physically. That led to an even more healthy overall lifestyle. One of balance in as much as I can. Thank you for bringing this to light for those who didn't know much about Lyme disease before now. It means the world to those of us still suffering.",False
25,10,A great and educational film!,swright-09134,n/a,16/08/2025,A great film that gives you all the emotions of dealing with Lyme disease! I feel like finally someone understands what it's been like for me living with Lyme for the last 17 years. I watched it with my husband and mom and it helped them understand so much. I am forever grateful for this film! It gives you hope and it's very educational at the same time. It was well done. I wish everyone would watch this including my dr!! I'm still left with so many emotions even the next day after watching this film. It was brilliant!! I think it should be streaming on every app and getting out to everyone!!!,False

1,9,Why the low score?,steeevzy,n/a,16/08/2025,Don't understand the low rating on this film. Excellent surfing but also gets into a side of these guys we don't usually see. In particular I loved seeing the tension between having friends and enjoying surfing together (like in the Oi Pro scene) but also keeping that competitive edge (like in the Pipe scene). Seeing the frustration and pressure that pro athletes go through I'll was a very cool perspective.,False
2,9,Score does not reflect,reisdmr,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a short film made for fans of surfing, and especially John John Florence. It provides an excellent look into the lesser seen side of surfing throught the struggles of one of the best surfers currently in the world. The beautifully shot surfing montages, call backs to other projects and events that have been big parts of the journey, how he came back from a possibly career ending injury. This film is more than just a quick look at the big names of surfing, it is John's journey that he put to camera. John's content is always excellent and this is no exception.",False

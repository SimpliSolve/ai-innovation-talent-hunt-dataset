1,9,Important documentary about crime,johnmars-62771,n/a,16/08/2025,Ever gotten the feeling that the media is only telling you half of the story? Well here are the missing pieces.,False
2,9,The Part of the story we're not getting,arcarter-78334,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the first documentary I've watched by Lauren Southern however I've always admired her work. This was so good! It provides insight from all the perspectives involved in today's atmosphere. Keep an open mind while watching, these are real people who've been affected!",False
3,9,"Well worth a watch, but quite long.",michael_and_zita,n/a,16/08/2025,Great docco takes in so many different aspects coming from many different angles leaving very few stones unturned.Only complaint is it's very long 1:50 + another 10 minutes run down from Lauren.I think it really should have been edited to 1:30Should note its also a docco i think you have to watch more than once to take it all in.,False
4,10,Get Caught Up in Crossfire,Scot_W,n/a,16/08/2025,Powerful stories told in a visually stunning way; Crossfire bursts off the screen as it airs all sides of a turbulent and contentious issue facing a dangerously fragmented United States. Lauren Southern and Scooter Downey have gone beyond the tightly scripted narratives of the mainstream media in pursuit of the truth and shown once again how vital independent journalism is in this outstanding documentary.,False
5,10,A must watch!!,mauries-588-641726,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing doco! A must see, Lauren is a rare spark of truth in a world of deceit",False
6,10,"Quality documentary, a must watch",vinaynorthamerica,n/a,16/08/2025,Excellent and unbiased documentary about some current issues that tend to be misrepresented.,False
7,10,Unmissable documentary!,debi-41125,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brilliantly put together doco on one of today's biggest issues. Well done Lauren on such a professional, well edited, informative production on such a tight budget - you certainly wouldn't know it! I hope this gets the viewing it deserves.",False
8,10,Thought provoking masterpiece,mfdeakin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another great documentary from Lauren Southern. The main stream journalists could learn a thing or two about real journalism from Lauren. No scripted nonsense, just raw content.",False
9,10,Amazing doco,shootingblanks-36802,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another great piece of work from Lauren Southern, worth the watch for everyone",False
10,1,Not objective,jennykilmer-75106,n/a,16/08/2025,Very biased look. It is interesting and draws you in but not a genuine account. It is very long - suggest that you not rely on this documentary to understand what is going on.,False
11,10,The views & truths that the mainstream media don't want you to see.,illpromusic,n/a,16/08/2025,What is really going on? Great insight into the truths about Antifa & the police the left doesn't want you to see.,False
12,1,Hmmm.,andystacie,n/a,16/08/2025,Before you watch this be sure to research who is behind it. It's hard to trust that this is an objective film when it was created by a known white nationalist. I don't think a woman who defends Richard Spencer is a cogent voice for what is happening in the BLM movement.,False
13,10,Excellent way to capture the different angles,ashleycholerton,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found this to be so much of a better way of finding out everything that's going on. It seems so often that the news is either lying or that they're not telling me everything, this documentary not only confirms that, but also shows how much they're not telling us.
But here we see the views of the police officers, the victims and the instigators. It feels fair, like everyone is getting a say and giving the viewer the information they need to make their own much more informed opinion on the events shown.Lauren and Scooter have yet again expertly captured a situation, answered questions and shown what the public need to see, yes parts of it hit hard and it's scary to see some of these real world issues. But I think it needs to be.",False
14,10,Truth,rhomulas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Expert writing, factual, what more do you need from a documentary",False
15,10,Apolitical and raw,tartankangaroo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is the one to watch if you would like to understand the myriad of views on the riots plaguing the USA over the last year. Showing all sides of the story, it is a hard hitting, raw, confronting expose of the violence and motivations of the rioters and their supporters Vs the law enforcers who have to deal with it. Balanced and apolitical, Crossfire is a vital movie for these troubled times.",False
16,10,Well worth watching,dtraise,n/a,16/08/2025,Watch this film for an enhanced perspective on current events in the USA. Presented in a thoughtful and objective manner.,False
17,10,Enjoyed it,jeremy-whittington,n/a,16/08/2025,I enjoyed the documentary. IMDb thinks I need to write a book to say I liked something. So here's a book.,False
18,10,Tackles the issues others are too afraid to discuss,Akodi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Right from the get go this documentary had me hooked.Starting with a summary of how police, prisons and community relations have come to the point we are at today, where trust is at an all time low and defunding is either happening or being seriously discussed.All viewpoints and options are explored with interviews from all sides of the spectrum being shown.The viewer comes away with a far greater understanding of current events, policing in America and exposure to the viewpoints of those they agree with and those they don't.",False
19,4,Blatantly one-sided and presumptuous,Unitas31,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a blatant pro-cop documentary, where the viewpoint was created before the content was researched. They failed to point out how the war on drugs failed, how the prison-industrial complex if faulty, and attributed the mid-90s crime drop to anti-crime technology (it was because of abortion + Roe v Wade, read Freakonomics). Nothing special.",False
20,10,Certainly the other side of the narrative - the side we all need to know,bennetts-steve,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is brilliantly done. Covers the current state of affairs very nicely. It also raises some smart questions and points out that the existing problems in the US in particular are not what the media wants you to believe. Lauren Southern does a
great job summarizing the situation at the end. It also does a great job showing antifa for what ii is - coopted by the very fascist agenda they say they are against.",False
21,9,Spot on!,joanalidiarmartins,n/a,16/08/2025,Another great work from Lauren! It provides accurate information on subjects hard to discuss with most people,False
22,10,Excellent documentary,pensacolacomputer,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was VERY hard to watch. Why isn't HBO or any channel picking this up? Because they DO NOT want you to watch it or even know about it. They do not want you to see the truth. PERIOD. Thank you for making this, although I had to turn my head and/or close my eyes multiple times. Nothing is going to change until we start having a honest and open conversation of why things are only getting worse in America. Wake up people.",False

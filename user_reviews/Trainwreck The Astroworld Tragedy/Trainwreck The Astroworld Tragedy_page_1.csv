1,8,Kind of Intense,IMGuuDFAM,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is a well done documentary do not get me wrong but it is very intense. There were times when I felt I was at the concert. Very Strange.The victims testimonies teared me up a bit so be prepared for those. The negative reviews mentioned the tone was to sway our opinions towards Travis but we really did not have to, the proof was in this documentary of what happened. Total neglect from involved.The documentary did what it was supposed to do and that is bring the art in motion to the viewer and that is what the director did here. Towards the end did feel rushed but all in all id definitely recommend watching this.",False
2,8,How does Live Nation sleep at night?,kewlcow334-530-362355,n/a,17/08/2025,"I have no formal training in how to rate a documentary. I can only give my opinion.Honestly, I appreciated this one. This event is of significant interest to me because I am from Houston, and remember hearing about this on the news. Travis Scott, in my opinion, brought disgrace to Houston. The fact that he gets to carry on with his life of luxury and others don't is disgusting.However, while I initially solely blamed Travis Scott, after watching, I have an entirely new perspective. So, learned something, which is why I watch documentaries to begin with.How Live Nation skirted the blame is beyond me. Perhaps we don't have all of the information? IDK, but those text messages between the producers and sound engineer tell me everything I need to know. I wish I had received my jury summons for that day. They 100% should have been sued for the $750 million dollars, and the people should have won. Maybe things would actually change if they were hit where it hurts- their greed.This documentary won't bring back the people that were lost, but I'm glad someone was able to share their perspective, so it's definitely worth the watch. I don't know how the people at Live Nation sleep at night...so sad this tragedy could have been avoided.",False
3,7,Did They Really Learn the Lesson?,AlbertinaW,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary does a solid job capturing individual experiences at Astroworld, but it lacks a deeper investigation into why the tragedy happened in the first place. There's a clear absence of critical reflection on the organizational failures, especially from Live Nation's side.As someone who has attended many hip-hop shows over the years, I've seen firsthand how dominant Live Nation is in the live music scene-and how little seems to have changed since Astroworld. I went to Rolling Loud last year, also produced by Live Nation, and it honestly didn't feel like any lessons had been learned. Security staff seemed untrained, and crucial aspects like venue selection, crowd flow, and transportation were clearly not well thought out.Given the intensity of hip-hop crowds, the rise of rage culture, and the continued lack of proper organization, it's not hard to imagine something like this happening again (though I hope it never does). I really hope this documentary sparks serious conversations among concert organizers and show producers about safety, logistics, and accountability in live event production.",False
4,7,Hard to watch,allie_wells,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's not often that a documentary effects me that much, the camera footage literally taken first hand of people that had fallen is insane. I had to take a few breaks while watching it as I felt like I couldn't breathe myself.The lack of planning with this event is unbelievable. How they thought the layout of that stage and having everyone rush in would end well I don't know. I'm honestly surprised more people weren't killed! It's so sad hearing the testimonies of the people that were at the concert and lost friends. Let's hope some lessons were learned here because it seems like there was no actual planning.",True
5,7,Where is the accountability?,paul-allaer,n/a,17/08/2025,"As ""Trainwreck: The AstroWorld Tragedy"" (2025 release; 80 min.) opens, it is ""November 5, 2021"" and Travis Scott headlines Live Nation's AstroWorld festival that he started in 2018. It's the first big event in Houston after COVID, and people are ready to party, and party hard. The venue is massive so what in the world could go wrong? Turns out, plenty... At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: I remember these events vaguely but had not seen any footage or further analysis of it, until now. This documentary lays it all out in a clear and concise manner, including plenty of interviews with people that were there: festival goers, but also a Live Nation photographer, a professional event planner, and even 2security guards who, believe it or not, were hired the day before the festival started and seemingly without any prior experience in security services. It soon becomes very clear that things are going terribly wrong, with tragic results. Surely someone is going to be held accountable, right? How about Travis Scott, who has a prior record of inciting crowds (we see footage of a prior Lollapalooza show where he incites the crowd to rush the stage, and then, SHOKCER (not), the crowd does exactly that). We see details of the horrendous layout of the site, essentially turning the space into several inescapable death traps. We see texts from Live Nation officials as the concert is starting that they fear the worst, including death. Watching this documentary is not easy and certainly is not a lot of fun. In fact, I felt incensed and angry, as this tragedy did not have to happen, but instead, as one talking head puts it, they ""ignored blaring warning signs"". For shame.""Trainwreck: The AstroWorld Tragedy"" started airing on Netflix last week. If you wonder how a large music festival botches so much in so little time, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
6,7,Informative and Moving,MercedesL-7,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI thought this documentary provided good insight to two concert-attendees' experiences as their own stories overlapped. It was fortunate that one persons act of bravery helped save the life of another's. I found myself tearing up hearing the testimonies of other people who were at the concert. I think it's vital that other people watch this to understand what truly went on that night.What I think could have made this documentary even more complete would be seeing a response from the company that sold the tickets, the venue owners, and other entities responsible for ensuring the safety of the concert goers. It is understandable though, that it may not have been the main focus to shed a spotlight on the above mentioned individuals as it may take the focus away from the experiences of the victims of the Astroworld Tragedy.",True
7,7,A Truly Heartbreaking Watch,Feftus,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary was genuinely so hard to watch as they made the entire thing as emotional as possible ðŸ˜­, it really felt like I couldn't breathe the entire time and really made me feel like I was there in the awful tragedy. It was very well made and was so sad the entire way throughout, it really gave me so much more insight into the incident and definitely made me think so much deeper about it. Live Nation handled it horribly and Travis really could've stopped performing during his time, even though he couldn't ""stop the show"", he was was the show, and he could've just put the mic down. Also the black and white forehead rub was a terrible apology. R. I. P to all of the lives lost in the incident ðŸ•Š.",False
8,6,Sleepy Rating Scale 3/5- Sitting in Bed,thebimp,n/a,17/08/2025,"When this incident happened, I was glued to social media as it was all going down. Once the concert attendees were tearing down gates and barriers to enter the venue, I wasn't surprised the disaster happened. I had never seen anything like that before and I have been to a lot of concerts. I'm not sure if it was just unruliness that came from youth finally being allowed out of the house for a music event mid-pandemic. My heart goes out to the families of the people lost at the concert. Nobody expects going to a concert would lead to a family member's demise. Doesn't seem like anyone was held accountable in the end and Travis Scott still continues to be a popular artist though I can't name any of his songs.",False
9,8,I Could Not Breathe Just Watching This,cutie7,n/a,17/08/2025,"Absolutely shook after watching Trainwreck: The Astroworld Tragedy on Netflix. I couldn't breathe just watching this - my chest was tight the entire time. This isn't just a documentary; it's a gut-punching, meticulously laid-out exposÃ© of everything that went wrong that night.From the very first few minutes, you know you're in for something heavy. The way they interweave real crowd footage, survivor interviews, and expert analysis creates this unrelenting sense of dread. You already know what happens, but watching it unfold - watching the warning signs be ignored in real-time - is nothing short of harrowing.What this documentary does so well is show how utterly systemic the failures were. It wasn't just one misstep. It was everything: overcrowding, poor infrastructure, a shockingly dangerous stage layout, totally inadequate security, and a horrifying lack of accountability. The festival was a pressure cooker, and no one stepped in to relieve it until it was far too late.Shame on you, Travis Scott. The documentary doesn't sensationalise - it lays it all out, fact by fact. You see the crowd screaming for help. You see people trying to stop the show. And yet the music kept going. The lights kept flashing. The hype machine didn't stop - even as lives were being crushed right beneath the stage.It's painful. It's infuriating. But it's essential viewing. If you care about live music, about public safety, or about basic human decency, Trainwreck is a must-watch. It's more than just a documentary. It's a demand for accountability.",False
10,6,Could've Been More,haznaclaudia,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerAstroworld has been a tragedy which I wanted to know more about ever since it happened and also what prompted me to watch this but it didn't click fully with me.I enjoyed the connection with the victims and their families the documentary provided and how emotionally charged it all was, aswell as the footage from the actual concert which makes you feel the brutal reality of this tragedy.On the other side I feel like it could've been so much more and exactly what went down and why it went down, who was at fault for this and how it could've been prevented should've been explored more instead it was way too focused on Travis.",True
11,8,A well-done doc depicting gross human negligence...,C_R_Saxby,n/a,17/08/2025,"I just finished watching this documentary, and I must say, I'm both impressed and massively devastated. It's hard to comment on the filmmaking when the subject matter is so reprehensible, but I need to give props to the documentarians for weaving together an emotionally engaging, yet fair and balanced narrative drawn from numerous first-hand accounts. I particularly liked the input from the gentleman working for the company that performed the investigation, calling the concert promoters and artists to task by revealing the many blatant planning and safety transgressions leading to all those pointless deaths. Shame be upon them and their misguided greed. I hope they've learned from their grievous humanitarian error, thus enabling them to put their shame in the rearview.",False
12,6,A somber & infuriating documentary about the corporate malfeasance of Live Nation...,mdw0526,n/a,17/08/2025,"Netflix continues its run of disaster porn, these tightly edited, punchy docs under the ""Trainwreck"" banner and I'm grouping these two together because we watched them back to back. While different in tone, both examine the chaotic consequences of crowd behavior and what happens when no one's in charge. ""The Real Project X"" revisits the bizarre true story of a viral invitation, poor local oversight, and a quiet Dutch town engulfed by a mob intent on mayhem. It feels quaint now, but the seeds of today's algorithm-driven chaos were already there.In contrast, ""The Astroworld Tragedy"" is a somber and infuriating chronicle of corporate negligence, with a behemoth like Live Nation prioritizing profits over lives, and facing barely any accountability. As someone old enough to remember being lifted off my feet in the crush of a Halloween crowd in the Castro in 1990s San Francisco, the concert crowd footage lands viscerally. Mass gatherings can flip from euphoric to deadly in seconds, so I've learned to generally avoid anything that's going to give me a panic attack.",False
13,5,Why?,coleceirin,n/a,17/08/2025,"The documentary is well-produced and emotionally impactful, but it lacks objectivity and balance. It fails to fully investigate systemic responsibility and instead fixates too much on Travis Scott's persona, undermining its own stated conclusions. The editing choices from the ominous music to the lingering shots of distressed fans feel crafted to steer emotion rather than inform. By leaning heavily into aesthetic mood and symbolic blame, Trainwreck misses an opportunity to ask deeper, harder questions about Live Nation, security protocols, city planning, and crowd control. Instead, it subtly nudges viewers toward a singular emotional conclusion, even while claiming neutrality. That disconnect is why it doesn't fully succeed as a documentary.",False
14,n/a,The Astroworld Tragedy,n/a,n/a,17/08/2025,"Trainwreck The Astroworld Tragedy a documentary on Netflix struggles with fundamental fairness. While acknowledging Live Nation and organizers' failings (e.g., security texts about crushes before Travis Scott's set), it disproportionately targets Scott's image and ""hype culture"" as an implicit cause. This framing, including subtle visual digs like the Utopia Mountain poster, feels like emotional persuasion over factual inquiry. The documentary underplays critical details Travis pausing his set, lack of police or security intervention, his post-tragedy support and avoids deeper examination of Live Nation's safety history. It leans into narrative scapegoating, undermining its own factual conclusions and hindering a truly balanced understanding of the tragedy.",False
15,6,meh,guyperi,n/a,17/08/2025,"Good but not too intresting like if it was a bit longer I wouldn't
The movie was good, but not too interesting. It started off decent and had a few cool scenes, but nothing that really grabbed my attention. If it had been any longer, I probably wouldn't have finished it. Some parts felt slow or dragged on, and the story didn't fully pull me in. The characters were okay, but I didn't feel super connected to them. It's not a bad movie-just kind of average. One of those films you watch once, maybe enjoy a little, but then forget about. I wouldn't really recommend it unless someone just wants something to watch in the background or kill time.",False
16,9,Tragedy Unfolds,Crol32-41,n/a,17/08/2025,SpoilerThis documentary walks you through the tragedy that people experienced at Astroworld. You feel goosebumps by just listening to their stories and it makes you feel like you were in there experiencing it with them. You are left in shocked and disbelief of how Live Nation and Travis Scott were not really punished and justice was not given to all the young people that lost their lives that day. It is definitely a sad documentary but I appreciated how they got actors that were there that day to share their stories. They also got professional input on the bad design and planning of the festival which makes their point even more valid.,True
17,8,Closer look on tragedy,ValU-2,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerMy cousin friend, Sophia, was impacted by this tragedy. This documentary provided a closer look to what happened, what went wrong, and what could have been better. This sad tragedy was preventable. Red flags were everywhere and they were ignored and planning was not in place. My heart goes out to those lives lost. So many young lives lost. They were just going to have a good time. My heart also goes out to their families. Hopefully this is a learning experience for Live Nation to keep their patrons safety at the forefront always. I am glad we still have Sophia with us and that she saved 2 lives.",True
18,1,From First Aid to First Twerk ðŸ’€,Allstar734,n/a,17/08/2025,"How is this real? The nurse in the Astroworld doc was so out of pocket. She's talking about a literal tragedy where people died... then they randomly show her twerking?? Completely disrespectful and unnecessary. It made the whole thing feel unserious. She's not the main character - she's supposed to be a professional. Who edited this and thought, ""Yep, this fits""? Embarrassing. Just... why? Felt more like clout-chasing than honoring victims. Totally killed the tone.This was a moment to show care and respect, not promote yourself. If you're in a tragedy doc, act like it. Not everything needs a spotlight.",False
19,8,Wow...horrific,jnxwsdyk,n/a,17/08/2025,"This was really heartbreaking and scary to watch. Most people go to a concert and never think this could or would happen. I'm shocked that the planning was so poor, considering Live Nation is the biggest concert organizer in the world.The lack of safety and planning is absolutely atrocious. My heart goes out to the victims and their families. This was just awful and devastating, but something everyone needs to watch. Large crowds are not safe. You really never know what will transpire attending something like this.If you find yourself in this position, please get out ASAP if you're able to.",False
20,9,Tragedy,Show23,n/a,17/08/2025,SpoilerThis was a great documentary. It made you feel like you were there at the concert and getting to see the different perspectives from different groups of concert goers from some who lost and some who got hurt. From ppl who worked security to ppl who can say this was bad planning. It gave goosebumps and so sad what happened. This should never happen again and concert goers should learn from this as live nation and the other ppl responsible will never care and never do better or right. This was a tragedy that had red flags all over it and nothing was done to stop it while knowing it was happening.,True
21,1,Slowing down to see a car wreck without focusing on what caused it.,chinesespiders-67488,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary leans so heavily into the distress around individuals that attended the event and the impact on the families of them that suffered as a result of the incompetence as the central theme.The incompetence of those running the show and their failings seems like a side story.Using Travis Scott's music as a means to build tension during the cruishing scenes, and to build excitement early on in the doc is an insult to all those that suffered as a result to the mismanagement of this event.Shame on netflix for putting this out.Harrowing emotional bait without any constructive conversation.",False
22,8,Shocking!!!,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,17/08/2025,"The world opened up in 2021 after the COVID-19 pandemic. World-famous rapper Travis Scott put on another huge event, a two-day Astroworld festival. Tickets sold out in thirty minutes. As people arrived at the site, the chaos began; all control was lost, and people stormed the gates. The concert began, and a massive crowd tried to reach the front of the stage.This is the most harrowing in the Trainwreck series that I've seen so far, this one is truly disturbing, it simply should not have happened.Nobody seemed willing to take any responsibility for what happened; everyone played a part, from the encouragement to go too far from the stage, to the ineptitude of the security team, Live Nation, the planners, and the crowd themselves. It must have been terrifying for those in the crowd; absolutely awful.The discussion about the compression of people is horrific, and the footage of people being crushed on stage is genuinely grotesque; it's sickening. The interviews are almost too much, they really hit hard.If you're in the UK or a football fan, you'll be aware of the Hillsborough tragedy, where people were crushed at an overcrowded stadium-something that should never have happened, nor should the events here.Ayden Cruz, respect! The fabulous nurse too, huge respect! They're the real superstars.It should not have happened.8/10.",False
23,10,Mind blowing,NellyR-96,n/a,17/08/2025,"From beginning to end, I was completely hooked. This documentary does an incredible job of pulling you in and showing the human side of a tragedy that, until now, I had only vaguely heard about. It offers a powerful and emotional insight into the perspectives of the attendees, giving them a voice and space to tell their stories in a way that felt raw, real, and deeply personal.Sophia stood out to me in particular-her courage and composure during such a terrifying moment were truly admirable. Hearing her recount her experience, especially the fact that she helped save a life, gave me chills. That kind of bravery under pressure is rare, and her honesty made a lasting impression.One of the most compelling parts of the documentary was the inclusion of the actual text messages between the staff. It gave a behind-the-scenes look into what was happening internally during the chaos, and it really added depth to the story. It reminded me that while attendees were going through something traumatic, the staff was also navigating fear, confusion, and urgency.I went into this not knowing much about the incident, and I left with a heavy heart, a greater sense of awareness, and deep respect for those who were impacted. It's not an easy watch, but it's an important one. The creators did a phenomenal job piecing everything together with care and intention. Highly recommend watching it.",False
24,2,Scapegoating dressed as storytelling,omegaramkid,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you're someone who values fairness and balanced storytelling, Trainwreck The Astroworld Tragedy will probably feel frustrating. The documentary claims Travis Scott isn't legally at fault, but it still heavily frames him as the emotional villain focusing on his image, show style, and ""hype culture"" rather than the real logistical failures of event planners, security, and Live Nation.There's a strange tone throughout: ""We know it wasn't Travis's fault, but..."" That ""but"" becomes the centerpiece. It underplays how badly organizers failed even though they were texting about crowd problems before Travis went on stage. It also avoids deeper accountability, like the city's emergency response or Live Nation's safety history.The constant reference to ""raging"" and ""hype culture"" feels like code vague, judgmental, and borderline racialized, especially when you consider other genres (rock, EDM) don't get criticized this way. It's not fair to say someone's brand of energy caused a disaster. High energy isn't a crime and it's not a blueprint for chaos.Travis likely didn't know the extent of what was happening, and he did pause at least once when he noticed something wrong. Nobody from security or the police told him to stop, reportedly because they didn't want to trigger mass panic. And after the tragedy, he paid for funerals, offered support, and stayed quiet for months. But the documentary glosses over those facts.Instead of a neutral investigation, the film leans into narrative: the tragic faces, the ominous visuals, the subtle digs like that poster saying Travis Scott Live at Utopia Mountain, a jab that turns his album title into irony.Ultimately, this documentary feels less like an honest inquiry and more like emotional persuasion. It acknowledges Travis isn't responsible but keeps returning to him anyway, shaping audience emotions against him. That's not balance. That's scapegoating.",True
25,8,Insane! Unavoidable.,stewatson-70573,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't even remember hearing news of this in the UK, but I guess in Houston Dallas(?) they had Astroworld, which - from what I saw - used to be a 6 Flags park with rides.Basically, like Disneyland I guess? For those who don't know.And I didn't.This shows the disastrous building up to, and subsequent aftermath of a ""Festival"" which was poorly planned, resulting in about 11 deaths!None of these people went there expecting this to happen. And if you've been to a mad gig before, you may have felt yourself being surged around in the crowd?Like you literally have no choice in where you're going. There are hundreds of people all cramming one side of the stage, due to the set out of the stage.It was due to the last act finishing before this main headline dude, whose venue it was came on.But this delves much deeper into how and why it happened.It's got video footage from all angles, and it looked absolutely terrifying to me.Because I have been in a situation like that before. Where I was picked up, and literally moved around like a wave!This was a Rock Fest in the UK. Reading Festival.So I've been there. I've been the person looking at other people's faces to see ""is this normal?""
And when things become obvious that they WERE NOT normal in the right hand side of the stage - looking from the stage - the right hand side of the stage maybe had double the amount that were on the other side.And there were some brave brave kids there who actually managed to get up on stage, and she was screaming ""stop the show! People are dying!""
That's not anything that should happen at any organised gig.I have a really bad memory. So even after watching it, I can't remember the name of the company. But I guess it's like our version of Ticketmaster?They run most live gigs or festivals in the US.So they really needed more people on security.Because first off, that park would have had a safe number limit.The main stage would have had a safe number, for both sides of the stage.From what I learned in the documentary, this rapper is controversial for ruling up his fans.It almost looked like anarchy when hundreds, if not THOUSANDS of people breached the fences, and tore straight through security.Knocking down metal detectors.So now there's an unknown number of people in that park!I think they said 35k people was their max.But with the poor security. The poor management.A breakdown in the line of command too! As there were only 2 people ALLOWED to call the show off.So as at least FIVE people are receiving CPR from paramedics, Drake comes on stage. And there's more surging.These were just kids. And it was so sad to see how senseless this all was!The OSHA guy (I think) had some great demos on his laptop of what happened. Using dots, not footage.And you see that the right hand side of the stage is most accessible from the last stage.You'd have to walk past it to get to the left side of the stage.So people were just crushed into each other, and the footage of it makes me reach for my inhaler!It's a very sad, and eye-opening documentary.I'm so uneducated when it comes to the rap scene.I'm a 48 year old white man. So it's not what I follow.I'm a 90s guy. Wu Tang, NWA, Biggie and Tupac, theist goes on... And on.I could never imagine one of them trying something like this.I feel like the guy's heart was in the right place. He grew up there, and when it shut down, it obviously affected him.So he put one a year on, for his hometown. Now that seems like a good thing.But I'd say there were way more people there than should have been. Did that guy care too much about that?I don't think so.At Reading for example, they'd have checkpoints, where security would just quickly check your wrist band.That obviously didn't happen here.It seems they needed at least 100 extra security. If not 200!But that kid seemed very anti authority. So, I don't know where the blame falls. But it HAS to be the promotors, the people who put of the gig. LIVE NATION! That's who put the gig on.Boycott them.",True

1,5,Too much talking and exposition,markcoyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a welcome and well intentioned short film but much more about the maker than the birds. For a film about birdsong, the constant talking, explanation, life story and music dominate instead. There is not a gap of twenty seconds before the talking starts again. Even when watching for the birdsong, there is continual speech. A lot of the talking could be subtitles and let the natural sound be the focus. It could of been stunning as is the quiet,awe filled ending.The film is less about the birdsong than the maker's life and journey. A film focused more on the birdsong and a short additional one about the making of it and life of the maker would work better. The birdsong itself barely gets any time, which really is a missed opportunity. The birdsong, scenery and brief shots of the natural world are beautiful but brief. The music is okay in setting the intended sad tone but is otherwise completely unnecessary.The fact that humans dominate the film, even if well intentioned, tells us a lot about why the bird habitats are taken. Even in a fim about them, they come second to human interest.I'm glad it was made,but the focus feels wrong, just let us hear more of the birds in a quiet environment - while we can.",False

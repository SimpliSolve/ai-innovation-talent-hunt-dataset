1,10,Moved me to tears,jeffreyprice-30063,n/a,15/08/2025,"We're all human and we all struggle for relevance and acceptance. This film peals-back the layers of discrimination that often dictate our fate in sport and in life. It's a thought-provoking and moving tribute to the outcast or marginalized trail-blazers who often pave the way for others at their own expense, not because they're less gifted, but because they're somehow different. As frustrating and invasive as it is to be confronted with the reality of discrimination head-on, this film gives us hope that things can and will change.",False

6,10,INSPIRING FILM,mackenziedslater,n/a,15/08/2025,'On Thin ice' is my favorite documentary of 2019. I came across it on Amazon and I'm glad I did. This is the kind of movie that everyone should see. The director crafts an incredible story about facing your fears and using past hardships to better yourself and society. These athletes in the film are exceptional and their bravery is aspirational to say the least.,False
7,10,On Thin Ice - what a pleasant Surprise,michelinmen,n/a,15/08/2025,"I must start by saying that I came across this Documentary because it was on a list of other sport Docs and the graphics brought my attention to the photo for On Thin Ice. I was pleasantly surprised by the names and faces of the athletes that came across the screen throughout the film many whom were Olympic medalists. However, what struck me the most about this film was the raw honesty of the interviews that were given by these men and women and these are the real champions.",False
8,10,Favorite Sports Doc of 2019,drmrs-46768,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is universal. Whether you're a fan of sports or not, everyone can relate to this film. It shows first hand that ""sport has the unique power to advance greater understanding and respect.""",False

10,10,Very well done,Samsfaves,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was great to see a young new director take on a project that relies on an enormous amount of historical information handed out by Pulitzer Prize Historians. The real heart and soul of the film brings us full circle to ""Today's Game Changers"" These are not only the athletes themselves but Civil Rights Activists like Michael Skolnick and Hudson Taylor who encourage them to break the barriers of institutional racism that are embedded in our society.
I will recommend On Thin Ice to my network for sure.",False
11,n/a,Amazon surprise,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Found this streaming on Prime. Cool picture with a number of interviews with inspiring athletes. Could have been longer, but it's a good survey of the athletes and their sports and features some interesting history on speed skating from the early 1900s. Had never heard of Irving Jaffe or Charles Jewtraw or the antisemitism of the Lake Placid Club. Crazy that Jewish Olympic athletes couldn't even get a good night's sleep the night before a race in 1932 because they were Jewish.If you need a reminder that past is prologue, history doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes, give this a watch-especially the segment titled ""history."" More relevant now than ever.",False

1,9,Big Picture holistic view of a great American genius,freedomkrg,n/a,15/08/2025,"While known for being an economist, this overview of a truly brilliant thinker, highlights the full variety of his research and writings. Through his own words and interviews with peers, Sowell's intellectual rigor and devotion to the facts and truth endeared me even more to one of my heroes.
I now have a longer list of his books that I must find, and an even stronger desire to introduce others to this courageous intellectual... the rare honest intellectual.
Can not wait for the bio coming out by the same writer.",False
2,8,Great documentary about Sowell,cbbess,n/a,15/08/2025,"I wish more Blacks (like myself) learn more from Sowell and less from the liberals, who ultimately don't teach critical thinking. I'm grateful to have learned from him. Voddie Baucham is a great theologian (not just an intellectual) that I wish other Blacks would learn from as well. Either way, Soli Deo gloria.",False
3,7,Free doc that's a fun watch and good intro to Thomas Sowell,JurijFedorov,n/a,15/08/2025,"The main reason I rate it 7 and not 8 is because I have frankly already seen a ton of docs about Thomas Sowell, have seen a ton of interviews from him and read 3 of his books so far - will be at least 1 more this year. I know all this already and have seen many of the shots and statements before. So for me, it's not that new, but man this is a great intro for sure! It may be the best Thomas Sowell intro out there. The shots are all amazing high quality, the photos are great, the interviews are clear and fun, the statements are informative.Thomas Sowell of course is not all science and fact based. He does have a very clear ideology and at times he does skip data and facts to reach a conclusion. But for him it's much more rare than for 95% of social scientists so he's still a top level researcher and one of the greatest intellectuals of our time. The doc does show how he is biased or how his conclusions are influenced by personal experiences. I'm not sure all the statements are true as we just cannot know how his mind developed. But it's a good way to present his biases without hitting him over the head with them. He thinks people should have a freedom to choose schools that fit their kids the best, the government and left-wing researchers disagree. I think that if the results are better or the same free choice should be given as more freedom is better if all things remain equal.",False
4,10,Such a great mind,samanthaleyba,n/a,15/08/2025,The movie is so riveting! Learning about Thomas Sowell is such an honor. I'm inspired to start reading all his books!,False
5,10,"""Common sense is the realised sense of proportion""",diocesan_sport,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dr. Thomas Sowell is like that cool step-dad that took care of your mom when your real father wasn't around. He gives cool advice, listens, is straight to the point and expects nothing in return. Hollywood gives film awards out like candy and yet this documentary will most likely (NEVER) get any recognition from arguably one of the greatest minds. Why? Common sense doesn't exist in Hollywood. No spoilers... just watch.",False
6,10,A must watch to save America!,cwkemple,n/a,15/08/2025,Please watch this excellent documentary and read more Thomas Sowell!!,False
7,3,Lots of backslapping--not a deep dive.,mikeborgen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not a very well produced documentary. More sound bites then a deep Dive in Sowell's philosophies. I would have rather heard Thomas himself talking about his point of view with in-depth looks a continuation and explanation of his unique beliefs.The narration and host see more content on sucking up to the man, and explaining how great he was instead of just letting his work speak for itself.For how brilliant Thomas is, there really isn't that much concrete evidence. Without political bias, Noam Chomsky would eat him alive in debate it seems, because his explanations are much more historical deeper and with longer discussions and every documentary an interview I've seen... Perhaps this was a disservice to Thomas himself but I'm not impressed by the man as I was hoping to be. Yes, he has the courage to punch down and self criticized his own people, but in his own words I'm not hearing any solutions just trade-offs to defend the status quo according to this documentary.",False

1,2,Rooney 2004: World at his Feet,studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBack in 2004 England had their 'Golden Generation' and for a time Wayne Rooney was the poster boy of it.This documentary ties in not only with the 20th anniversary of England going into Euro 2004 with a big chance of winning (how times have changed) and the BBC signing Rooney up as a pundit, albeit not a very good one.This documentary looks like it's been put together quickly and cheaply. Rooney doesn't even bother to take his coat off.The talking heads hired to talk about this period aren't great either. It must be depressing for Rooney that only Gabby Logan and Michael Owen are the only two people willing to talk about him.Even Michael Owen sounds bitter as anything that Rooney stole his limelight. Nothing unusual from Owen then.Please try harder than this BBC.",True

1,5,Great player. Underwhelming documentary.,ljamedia,n/a,15/08/2025,"Beyond the Dream is all very self-congratulatory but doesn't do a great job of explaining the scale of his unique achievements or putting them into a wider baseball context.If you're not a baseball fan or already knowledgable about the sport then I imagine you'll be bored out of your skull - it's largely just a collection of old legends and managers saying they respect him which you'd imagine would be a given.Save yourself an hour or two and watch some Youtube videos about Shohei and/ or read his Wikipedia, you'll get a lot more insight from there.Also, there are a lot of subtitles so it's not one to put on late at night!",False

1,6,The Long Rider,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFilipe Leite - who shot most of this footage - leaves behind his adoptive home of Canada to travel from Calgary all the way to Brazil riding his two horses Frenchie and Bruiser. He's following a trail inspired by Aim√© Tschiffely's 1925 equestrian journey that will take him eight years to travel as he adds up 15,000 plus miles across twelve countries.The travels were supposed to be shorter before the trail inspires Fellipe to go even further. Along the way, he deals with bad weather, corrupt border patrols and horrific weather conditions, all so that he can make the journey to his destination and then head back home, alone on the trail.Filipe is a world-renowned Long Rider, an award-winning journalist and a best-selling author of Long Ride Home and Long Ride to the End of the World. He's also the youngest person in the world to cross the Americas on horseback, an accomplishment celebrated by two statues of Fellipe being displayed in his native Brazil.The Long Rider was directed by Sean Cisterna, who also made Blood Creek, War of the Dead and Kiss and Cry. This is an interesting idea for a film and quite the story. Trust me, I don't think I could do what Fellipe has done.",True
2,10,An epic journey,tamsyn-matthews,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautiful and inspiring film. I love horses, so was bound to love this, but I think it would appeal to a wider audience than just horse and animal lovers. It ticks so many boxes; travel through stunning countries, restores your faith in humanity, romance, human kindness, triumph in the face of adversity, proof the love between humans and animals, the list goes on. The content seemed to be largely filmed by the rider himself, and some taken from news footage gathered in the places he stopped. He met some incredible characters along the way, was shown so much kindness and given so much help by ordinary people. On the flip side, he was shown the opposite by greedy bureaucrats at the border controls. I cried happy and sad tears, and some that were a mixture of both, was totally absorbed in the story, and the uplifting ending was a perfect finish to an epic journey. I'd rather watch a real and inspiring story like this, to a bunch of CGI blue aliens running around any day!!",False

4,10,A Definite MUST WATCH,rjbcbc,n/a,16/08/2025,"A terrific must watch documentary!! I hardly ever watch a spur of the moment documentary let alone write a review. I was born in Calgary and grew up in Southern Alberta in an area Filipe rode thru. Long Rider show the trials and tribulations of planning, preparing for and carrying out such an arduous journey. The people and the places along the way with some of the most beautiful scenery you will ever see. Look at the awards won most are Audience choice awards not critic awards. The film shows people of each country he travels thru. The GOOD The Bad and The UGLY. Take an hour and a half out of your schedule and watch this worthwhile movie.",False

8,9,Outstanding achievement!,latinfineart,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a really excellent movie, a great story of courage, strength, conviction, perseverance, and the ability to pull off something that is rather incredible, and almost superhuman. A really great tale about humanity, about geography, and about the the positive side of human kind. Though it does delve into some territory that's plagued with trafficking and what not, it still maintains a positive note and is a tribute to the Latinos who deal with the nonsense every day.Nothing but kudos to the entire team and the filmmakers for this project, and a special shout out to Felipe who was beyond extraordinary. A man who had the good fortune of having a wonderful family who supported him all the way, and when it comes down to it, it doesn't really get any better than that in this lifetime.This is a particular important film for Americans who do not have a passport and have never left the country.",False

10,10,Enjoy your jouney!,melpsilva-73731,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone has their own journey in this world. Understanding what our limits are, being flexible in the face of obstacles that arise and knowing how to learn from each one of them is what makes everything so incredible!The film The Long Rider shows Filipe Masetti living all of this to the extreme and moves us to never want to give up. He had to review the arrangements, the routes, be patient and perseverant. But his goal never changed, and he kept going.Whatever obstacles arise this week, move forward.

12,10,Amazing documentary!,taisnara_nascimento,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched it twice and cried both times. How not to cry?The story is full of courage, bravery and inspiration. Filipe shows us that when you want something, with a lot of determination and focus, we can achieve it. Contrary to the people who disbelieved.For horse lovers, it's quite a story. His love for horses and adventure is clear. Even I, who had never ridden a horse, felt the urge to take a horse and go out into the world.After all, it's on my favorites list: a documentary like this cannot go unnoticed. The journey touches us and makes it feel like we are riding with him.Looking forward to the feature film now.",False

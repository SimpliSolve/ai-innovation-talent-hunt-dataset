1,9,Lives with purposefulness,tst2280,n/a,16/08/2025,"A moving, highly personal account about people who used their wealth to help reverse human exploitation of nature. This follows the ""second careers"" of Doug & Kris Tompkins in which they left financially lucrative enterprises in order to pursue emotionally fulfilling endeavors to protect vast, endangered swaths of land in Chile and Argentina. Both came from successful stints with outdoor clothing and equipment companies (North Face, Esprit, & Patagonia) that were financially rewarding, but felt a moral calling to use their resources to preserve threatened ecosystems for the original inhabitants, both human and nonhuman. The photography of these regions is breathtaking..",False
2,10,"Sublime, A Veritable Catalyst of Emotions, and Aesthetically Uplifting",ofou,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a beautiful documentary, it really touched me deeply. It portrayed aesthetically what it really entails to work so hard for something much bigger than yourself that will endure across time, for the benefit of the whole ecology.It harmoniously marries aesthetic visuals with heart-wrenching narratives, depicting what it means to devote oneself tirelessly to a cause that stretches beyond one's mortal existence and encompasses the wellbeing of an entire ecosystem.At the heart of it all is a message about transcending our own limitations and desires for a common good that will endure through the sands of time. This documentary teaches us that what we sow today will bear fruits for generations to come, and in nurturing the Earth, we find a purpose larger than life itself.In conclusion, this documentary is not merely a film; it's an experience that implores introspection and a re-evaluation of our values and commitments. It's a clarion call to embrace our roles as custodians of this planet and work assiduously for an enduring legacy that extends beyond ourselves.Sublime. I have no extra words for it.",False
3,10,one the best docs covers nature,mehr-lashgari,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really adore this kind of personality who worships nature and nothing stupid else. We need encourage riches to do this. To rewild the nature in any cost. Rate hight to the film. We need it to be seen. A good example for wealthier people.We need to show how we can amend the human activities. How we can make forests both afforestation and reforestation. Iit the most important and the only religion we need on earth. The only religion we need in entire world not just in south america. Every one need to hear the new prophets. I hope this will be loud enough that every one hears this and listen to this. Afforestation and reforestation, remember them, these are our new religion.",False
4,10,"A must watch for ecologists, philanthropists and all outdoorsmen and women",michael-theunissen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Looking at all the reviews, it certainly is a mixed bag of reviews. And yes, reviews are subjective so everybody to their own. For me, having followed the lives of Doug Tompkins, Yvon Chouinard, Jimmy Chin, Tommy Caldwell, Alex Hannold, etc and having watched The Dawn Wall,Valley Uprising, Free Solo, The Alpinist ( all great doccies) it was just a deeper dive in the psyche of these outdoorsmen. I knew the story before the documentary was made . I was aware and had read The Responsible Company and was further aware that Let Your People Go Surfing by lifelong friend of Tompkins , Yvon Chouinard was compulsory reading for sustainable studies at Cambridge University, all set the stage for this documentary.So this documentary of the life of Doug Tompkins, with Academy Award winning videographer , Jimmy Chin was beautifully crafted and I loved every moment of it.I would beg to differ strongly with the naysayers, this is a fitting tribute to a true ecologist , supported by his amazing wife who continues his legacy.",False
5,3,Heights of Hypocrisy and Narcissism,cyril_mathew,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great. This documentary film is made to make one woman feel good about herself. Talk about narcissism. I don't know how much the documentary film makers were paid by the main protagonist of this film viz. Kristine Tompkins and her associates. Looks more like a PR film to me than anything else.So first you create multiple multi-national corporations and make your millions while destroying nature. If someone wants to know how, just check what are the raw materials for making the apparel and gear that Espirit, Patagonia and North Face sell. Then you spend those millions acquiring land from erstwhile colonial land-grabbers and their government who drove the indigenous people of South America from these very lands which they were living on sustainably for generations. Next when you understand the scale of the problem and realize that you won't be able to solve it, you turn around and ""donate"" that land to the very same government. And then make this movie to feel good about yourself. Excellent.",False
6,3,Soooooooo.....,GCrew42,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched the trailer and was intrigued cause I like the quality product from Patagonia brand.Talk about a boring story....trying real hard to understand the high reviews that we're given.....some reviewers stated that this documentary touched them emotionally ðŸ¤”.....and/or was best documentary ever ...... not so much...sure the lady seems nice and all, however, show is not about Patagonia, more so about this lady talking about herself and blah blah blah...and her same old simple life growing up that's no different than anyone else's.... albeit being financially wealthy ... sure she has a passion for nature but No real story here.......",False
7,5,Why It Didn't Work For Me,Dovyeon,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is supposed about saving Patagonia but really it's mostly talking about the woman and this guy that died like I never knew these people existed before the documentary so why would I care about complete strangers?I came to see a documentary about nature and saving it but that's not what this is about, it's about two Americans who came to Argentina and decided to create a national park or something or idk if it's really a national park cause the woman never stated of it was a national park or not but if it is they're really off to a bad start because it's not on par with National Parks in the US.",False

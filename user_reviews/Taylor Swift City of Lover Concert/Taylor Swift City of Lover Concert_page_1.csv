1,8,"Reminds me of the August 1, 1981 launch of MTV - a Swift promo for her latest album titled ""Lover""",Ed-Shullivan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mrs. Shullivan and I have always enjoyed travelling with a Taylor Swift album or two and her latest album ""Lover"" which was released in 2019 is featured this her latest solo TV performance. Taylor Swift's voice and music are exceptional and her songwriting abilities appear to be growing stronger with this release ""Lover"".I wouldn't call this an intimate TV concert but more or less a self promo of her 2019 album release ""Lover"" with a few live songs thrown in to give her vast fan base a taste of what to expect if they purchase her latest album.I can never figure out what persona Taylor Swift is attempting to emulate?
A down right country girl?
A easy rock singer?
A hard rock singer?
A main stream fashionista?
A sexy symbol?
A girl next door?
A sister?
A girlfriend?
A feminist in the women's liberation movement?
A self promoting junkie?Maybe this TV concert includes a little bit of all of the above, but mainly it is a self promotion for her 2019 album release ""LOVER"" since she has had to put any of her preferred live performances on hold (as do all recording artists worldwide) due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Interesting though as much as it reminded me of the early music videos released in the 1980's on MTV I have recorded her Taylor Swift: City of Lover Concert and I will watch it a few times more to supplement any delay of her live concerts.I give it a 8 out of 10 IMDB rating and it shouldn't disappoint her fan base but don't be fooled, it is simply a promotion to sell her latest 2019 album release ""Lover"".",False
2,7,There is no denying her talent,tenealesharman,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a huge swiftie, I got back to fearless days, and I adore this woman and believe she is self fulfilling prophecy. Her talent is undeniable, there's no question about that. I mean, you can't tell the difference between her studio albums and live performances, she's flawless.
I was confused when she announced the release of this, all swifties have seen the footage so I don't know if there was a lot of new stuff in there. But then I read that she released this because her 2020 performances are postponed due to covid, so just a little something for the fans, maybe something to look forward to during iso? From the beginning of her career, dare say her life, she's been thoroughly documented and would have most of her performances recorded so why not",False
3,8,Taylor Swift city of lovers review,maddiebuggie,n/a,16/08/2025,This isn't like a movie or show. This is more like Taylor Swift a famous singing is just Singing her songs from the lovers album. All of the songs she sung were great. But then I am a big fan of Taylor Swift band think all her songs are great. I didn't mind when she played some of the song acoustically Becuse I love acoustic music. I think Taylor Swift did a great job with the performance she give in the tapes concert. She did a great job in it. All of the songs were fantastic. I highly recommend everyone to watch this if you like Taylor Swift music.,False
4,10,Great teaser of the show!,muamba_eats_toast,n/a,16/08/2025,Only negative was that I wish it could have been longer. Along with her Netflix material lockdown has me turning into a real swifty so very good live and was nice to see a more natural acoustic led show than the usual big show which somehow just made her sound even better. One of the best talents of the last few decades.,False
5,2,No love for this one,Horst_In_Translation,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe title ""Taylor Swift: City of Lover Concert"" summarizes somehow what you are getting here. This is if we just look at the facts a 42-minute live action short film. Documentary you could say too. But of course, what this really is is super successful American recording artist Taylor Swift presenting her new album to an audience. I read here on imdb this is an exquisite audience? This did not come through here at all. It felt like any audience basically. Anyway, the director is Dan Massie, who has worked with other very successful recording artists in the past already. One would be the ginger dude. What is his name. Wait. Oh yes, Ed Sheeran. exactly. Not a big fan of him either. Don't feel his voice is anything special and to me it feels as if his success is mostly due to him giving off vibes like the normal guy from next door. But now we are getting a bit carried away I think. Back to this one here: I do not hate Taylor Swift. Actually, I liked her quite a bit in her beginning as a musician when she was still more about country than pop music. Even her early pop years I did not oppose too strongly. But as the years went by, she basically turned into the epitome of a generic pop music starlet who takes zero risks and wastes her talent on music that is way below her. This concert is the best example. Here and there, a song is mildly catchy, but most of the songs are completely forgettable. Even the catchier songs offer almost nothing in terms of being a challenge. No range needed whatsoever to pull them off. Like I said: zero risk-taking. Also this entire thing here was recorded in Paris and this can be seen in the title, which is really a very clumsy play on words combining the title of the album with Paris' nickname ""City of Love"". This basically says it all in a not positive way at all about the outcome here. Like I said at the start this is closer to 40 minutes than 45, so not too long and if it was ""real"" concert I would not be too happy because it's just not enough you get for your ticket money and honestly I think concert tickets to Swift's shows are fairly expensive. However, it is somewhat justified by this just being the presentation of the album. What else can be said. Oh yeah, in-between the songs Swift talks a bit to the audience, but it is nothing spontaneous at all. She learned it by heart before thow and I personally did not really feel as if what she had to say felt particularly interesting or informative or insightful. There we have the three I's. And still I won't deny that I have heard worse songs by Swift over the last couple years. But this does not mean that what you hear in here is good from any perspective. It's just a smaller degree of terrible. Says it all if this ""The Man"" song (or whatever it is called) is the best number of the night. For many other recording artists with more courage, maybe more talent too, it would have been the worst song. The entire thing here gets a massive thumbs-down from me. Absolutely not recommended and I cringed even once really hard when Swift told everybody her equality statement in relationships and then made the most bizarre connection to what she wants people to know/tell who disagree. I wonder if her ex-boyfriends agree that they have been part of Swift's song on a regular basis for a really long time. Not sure if it is still the case. Anyway, this one you may wanna skip at all costs of course. Big thumbs-down.",True

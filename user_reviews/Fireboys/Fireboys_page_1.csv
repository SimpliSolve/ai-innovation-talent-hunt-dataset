1,8,fire love lost...,timmermanwoodcraft,n/a,15/08/2025,"An intimate account of young offenders who get a chance to learn firefighting skills at Pine Cove..over a period of months we follow a group of young offenders seeking a way out, some want to escape solitude whilst others seek to build a new life..Fire is their salvation...or so it seemsAs the state of California uses incarcerated felons to be trained as firefighters....the same system ignores them after they have served their debts...some make it through a harsh training program, whilst others fail,...only to be put back into their cells...in the end it all comes down to how bad you want it....and how strong you are making it in the outside world...this documentary was superbly shot and edited...giving us a glimpse into the lives of young men who otherwise had no means of making it into the normal world...",False
2,8,Good Doc...But insight truths re prison to CalFire jobs,beecool53,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerGood documentary...very informative about incarcerated youths gaining skills that can hopefully lead to careers after their time is served.The downer is that even after completing their incarceration term at the fire camp, if their conviction involved a violent offense, they cannot be hired by CalFire to gain a firefighter career.....My thinking about this is...Why would CalFire need to hire a wild firefighting-trained, redeemed convict for a full-time paying firefighter position at..... $20 an hour?...
... when there is an endless number of incarcerated youths/young men that will be paid 2 to 4 dollars an hour?... The numbers were crunched, and it's cheaper for the state to keep using these incarcerated young men to fight fires...And to hell with them once they're released. A violent offender has no chance to redeem themselves.The California bill that was passed in 2020 is a step in the right direction... Expunging the record of nonviolent offenders so they can pursue this type of career.... But otherwise violent offenders can only have their term reduced through this program.",True
3,10,A refreshing account of a penal program that works,benjaminspera,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie brought back my memories of being in the Marine Corps. Seeing young ""punks"" evolve into responsible men through hard work and healthy camaraderie. Giving these boys a purpose with honor shows them the value of doing the right thing. I also really empathized with the kid who went home and struggled with finding purpose as a civilian after leaving what he knew. Best film I've seen in a long time. God bless those boys at Cal Fire.",False

1,5,WOW,hazangel-89910,n/a,16/08/2025,This is the first time a saw an overall rating of 1!!!! This woman is really not liked at all...hahahaThere is just something about her that is so inauthentic. She seems to want fame so bad. But only on her terms. I really wonder if Harry is truly happy because she does seem like she would be very overbearing.I used to watch the series Suits and never found her in any way talented or interesting to watch although I think that was the goal of the show since she was dating one of the main characters. She is just very average at best.I dont know much about her fathers side but based on what I have seen I do believe she feels like she is above them and wants to disassociate herself perhaps because she feels like she is better than them. Sad but true.I admittedly did not watch all of this because frankly she is just not that interesting.....,False
2,1,So was this documentary put out with the Royal Palace? Prince Charles and Camilla were the ones who did this to do anything they could to discredit this woman?,dawnsacks-01578,n/a,16/08/2025,Everything in this so-called documentary seems like it was done by the Royal Palace to totally discredit this woman because she is not what they wanted for the royal family... Who are these so-called journalist anyway and everything is secondhand knowledge to me this is a total piece of crap. The British media will do anything they can to slam this woman because she's not you know Harry is extremely happy with her and they have two beautiful children. She was also doing tons and tons of charity work along before she met Harry what a waste of celluloid. All I have to say is British media you are horrible horrible people.,False
3,10,Meghan adores truth,emackstarr37-874-940770,n/a,16/08/2025,"Meghan adores truth. The Royal Family's Never Explain Never Complain Mantra encouraged hate, vitriol, and threats to Meghan Markle and her and Harry's infant son. Stories leaked to the British Media by some who believe the Royal Family was the source of those leaks. Follow Meghan Markle as she tries to protect her family from the British people, the Royal Rota, and false narratives instigated and written about herself and her family. Go behind the trope of the false allegagations that Meghan made Kate cry. Follow Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex as now thrives and soars to new heights. Meghan Markle/Sussex is truly a bright shining star and will be forever known as, our Princess of the People.",False

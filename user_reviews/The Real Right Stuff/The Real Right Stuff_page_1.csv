1,10,"A wonderful documentary, a must watch",jakeh,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just finished watching this documentary and was quite amazed to see footage that I had not seen before. The additional Tom Wolf dialogue added much and gave this viewer a glimpse into how he managed to write ""The Right Stuff.""A word that comes to mind when I finished viewing is the word 'transfixed.' The entire documentary moves rather rapidly through the Mercury program, there were no dead spots.Having seen just about all of the documentaries on the NASA space program, this particular documentary went even further than many of previous documentaries with behind the scenes videos and interviews, some quite rare and seldom, if ever, seen. A splendid video encapsulation of the early space program and the courageous men and women that comprised that program.",False
2,9,"Watched it, like it, then could not watch it again thanks to Disney",tishiamal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Had a yearning to rewatch this because it so fascinated me with the footage. I know some complained it was not balanced with all the astronauts, yet it was still wonderful to watch.Come to find out Disney has pulled from streaming which I don't mind but then give me a chance to buy it on a DVD or a Bluray option.Is this America or is this some weird country where you find something you like and someone decides to no longer offer it...AT ALL.CREEPY AND CONTROLLING. Like you no longer want to make money off of something that some enjoy?All downhill now.And since my review is too short, I will only say this: all movies should be offered to those who love them otherwise, why even bother.",False
3,4,Disappointed,kbrooks-05490,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Right Stuff is about the first 7 astronauts. During this movie they only show the first 3, with Scott Carpenter going up twice. The others fall by the waste side.
They focus more on Scott Carpenter and John Glen.
The Right Stuff is fat better than The Real Right Stuff.",False
4,2,There are so many good documentaries out there. This ain't it.,mrbobob,n/a,15/08/2025,"I recommend The Right Stuff, and In the Shadow Of the Moon. But I've seen just about all that exist.This documentary is pointless. It manages to tell this exciting story in a boring way. And explains things poorly. I had to pause at several points to explain to my girlfriend the context, because it was just so poorly done and missing the interesting bits.I could probably go up on stage and improv a better telling of this story.No, choose another documentary.I'd give it a 3, but changing it to a 2 because it's so blatantly unnecessary when the story has already been told much better, e.g. in The Right Stuff.",False

1,9,Climate horror,anjefremovs,n/a,15/08/2025,"The film sinks audience deeper and deeper in despair of a man ruining his life. Just like in a horror movie, you want to somehow communicate with the protagonist and make him stop, but it is too late. The horror here is not supernatural or external. It is the all-too-human capacity for self-deception.This is climate anxiety given cinematic form - not through spectacle but through the quiet tragedy of good intentions gone catastrophic. The film offers no easy answers, only the sobering suggestion that salvation might lie not in radical escape but in finding the courage to nurture what we already have.",False

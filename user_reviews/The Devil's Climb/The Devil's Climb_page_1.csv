1,6,"Breathtaking cinematography and a somewhat ""sanitised"" story",panta-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"A National Geographic documentary that chronicles the journey of famed climbers Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold as they attempt to scale Alaska's perilous Devil's Thumb. One of the most dangerous mountains in North America, this 9,000-foot summit is notorious for its harsh conditions and difficult ascents. The documentary, which was directed by Renan Ozturk, a well-known filmmaker and fellow climber, chronicles the two men's amazing trip as they test their boundaries and confront the dangers of the Alaskan wilderness. The film highlights Alex and Tommy's strong relationship and resolve to create a world speed record by navigating the five spires of Devil's Thumb, despite the emotional and physical obstacles they face.Viewers receive a close-up view at the climbers' tactics, the stunning landscape, and the challenging situations that put their fortitude and talent to the test. The movie explores the motivations and life stories of these remarkable athletes along the road. The documentary does a good job of capturing the unadulterated beauty of the Alaskan scenery as well as the sheer willpower and perseverance needed to scale one of the world's most formidable peaks. It is an adventure that provides a glimpse into the world of high-stakes climbing and the unbreakable character of its participants, with breathtaking cinematography and a somewhat ""sanitised"" story.It might be summed up as a tale of friendship between Caldwell and Honnold that required the final confirmation-the Devil's Thumb!",False
2,8,Amazing feat of climbing,n-m-bertin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's clearly not as well done as The Alpinist, Free Solo, etc... It is still worth it, because this is the one that explored Alex and Tommy's friendship the most. I've seen the Reel Rock movies, and some are amazing, like the one on their speed run on The Nose or the Fitzroy traverse. Here it's a more complete story, since there is a lot of training with the cycling trip and the trial climb in Canada.However, the movie uses many clips from other Reel Rock interviews, so it's a bit weird. I wished more fresh clips were used. And unlike Reel Rock, they do not use interviews from other climbers explaining how much of an achievement this is. It's a bit unclear for example if this is the first ascent of the Thumb at all, or if it's just the first ascent from this side. The final little issue is the ending. There's no descent from the peak, did they descend on foot ? Helicopter ? It says they finished it right at sunset, which is not true given the position of the sun, but did they have enough sunlight to go back to camp on foot ? Did they go back in the dark ? All of these questions are left unanswered and it's frustrating.But just for the beautiful landscape in this remote part of Alaska, the beautiful friendship with 2 of the best and oddest climbers ever, it's worth it. Given that they were extremely lucky with the weather, this climb wasn't as hard as the Fitzroy Traverse, or even the Colorado traverse they did in Rocky Mountain National Park. They didn't get injured in any way. But the fact that they climbed 4 peaks in a single day, some parts scrambling with crazy exposure without a rope, that was insane... No one can do what these 2 can do. I wish them 10 more years of adventures like this.",True
3,7,7.4/10. Recommended.,athanasiosze,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love watching documentaries like this. In the last years, i have watched THE ALPINIST/MERU/THE DAWN WALL etc, even a tv series named Edge of the Unknown (with Jimmy Chin). Of course, everything started with the glorious Free solo.I admire very much Alex Honnold and the other people who engaged in this kind of activities. I love watching them breaking the ""limits"". THE DEVIL'S CLIMB is another good documentary, however, it is not as good as the aforementioned ones. It's less intense. I was still on the edge of my seat but not as much as with the other documentaries. I can't explain why, maybe it's more ""polished""? Maybe ending was a bit abrupt. I can't tell.In any case, every fan of those documentaries is gonna enjoy it, this is still beautiful to watch and these two guys are very likeable.But i would like to say something else here : Please, stop doing it. Alex and Tommy and so many other people tested their limits, risked their lives, did the unthinkable. It was amazing but it has to stop. No need to tempt your fate anymore, you have nothing to prove anymore to anyone and to yourselves.",False
4,7,He pushed a guy off a mountain,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Devil's Thumb is a tower of icy black rock in Alaska. It is one of the biggest alpine face in North America which has never been climbed. Some have even died trying. Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold decide to try.This is a National Geographic documentary. The visuals are amazing. I expected nothing less. It is going along and going along with the standard life and death of climbing. Then, Tommy tells the story of his climb in Kyrgyzstan at the age of 21. His group gets captured by rebels and he ends up killing a captor on the way to their escape. Now, that's a movie. It is literally less than a minute and that's the imagery that I will remember. And it's only through his words.",False
5,10,Absolutely Fascinating and inspiring,rjmeredith3382,n/a,16/08/2025,"Alex is an enigma from the perspective of this middle aged, half in shape guy. He inspires me to push myself over and over. From the first time I saw him climbing, it was patently obvious that he'd rather not be on camera. But he does, and he lets the camera catch him in bad spots saying awkward things. H s obviously a great climber, but a very unique one. He doesn't relish the show-off, loudmouth, arrogant moments. He just does what he seems to love, and let's people watch him enjoy it. Tommy was good in the documentary as well, and he didn't hold back in that he didn't know if Alex was doing this out of good motives or because he felt beholden to his hero. Overall it is an unforgettable journey.",False
6,7,Some outstanding footage but not enough of it,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""The Devil's Climb"" (2024 release; 75 min.) opens, we get a quote from John Krakauer in 1977: ""I couldn't imagine anyone ever climbing it"" (talking about Alaska's The Devil's Thumb. We then go to ""Estes Park, Colorado"", to the house of famed climber Tommy Caldwell, who is gearing up for a comeback after tearing his Achilles 18 months before. For good measure, his friend Alex Honnold (""Free Solo"") will foin him. But first they need to get to Alaska, and what better way to get there than.. by bike. At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is directed by Renan Uzturk, himself a climber, and the movie is a National Geographic production. The idea for this documentary is great,,, on paper. But when you watch it, unfortunately it feels like a missed opportunity. First, too much time is spent on the 50 day bike ride and sailing trip to get to the Devil's Thumb. Conversely, while there is some stunning footage as the 2 take on the Devil's Thumb, the end product feels rushed. And with a running time of only 75 minutes, why not take an extra 10-15 minutes of footage from that amazing climb? I was really surprised by this decision. Bottom line: it's not that this is a ""bad"" documentary. It simply feels like it could have been so much better.""The Devil's Climb"" started airing on National Geographic in 2024. It is currently streaming on Hulu, where I caught it the other night. If you are a fan of ""Free Solo"" and other such documentaries, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
7,10,Epic adventure. Epic friendship. Epic Climb. Epic movie!,shaisimchi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just finished watching this movie and WOW!Loved every single second of it! I watched ""Free Solo"" way before I started climbing just because I love adventure movies. Now I climb and am into mountaineering too and watching these movies is an even bigger inspiration now than it was before. One hour and 30 minutes of movie went by in a heartbeat! Estes Park is about 30 minutes from where I live and watching them start this amazing journey there was a fun little fact for me. I have been a cyclist for over 30 years now and this journey of cycling and climbing just feels to me like the dream of all dreams!The journey was amazing, the climb was amazing and Alex and Tommy together are just amazing.I wholeheartedly recommend this movie whether you are a climber or not. I will definitely watch many more times.EPIC!",False

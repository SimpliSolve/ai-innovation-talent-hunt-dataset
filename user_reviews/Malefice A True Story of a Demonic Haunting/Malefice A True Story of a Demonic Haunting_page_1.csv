1,9,Spiritual warfare,lorellebrown,n/a,16/08/2025,"No doubt in my mind, this is the real deal. This team is a great blend of different personalities that work well together. A documentary that proves spiritual warfare exists and requires fortitude and faith to fight the battle. Warning, you will have nightmares! I absolutely love the work that Sean does for spirit.",False
2,3,"Don't waste ur $. Nothing proven, validated or shown",jammingjudi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sorry, we were hyped up to watch this and it was such a dud. Now the movie Deliver Us From Evil is good, but don't be fooled by the use of Ralph Sarchie's name & brief video conference...he had nothing to do with this 'paranormal' experience... They don't even show the scratches that were to have said appear on a gals back.",False
3,10,A Must See,chromecelica,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the real deal if you want to see a chilling documentary that truly captures everything us horror fans/paranormal investigators/enthusiasts love. Being a fan of The Demon Files, it was especially refreshing to see Ralph Sarchie & Sean Austin working together again. Dave Spinks & Eric Conner are a class act as well with years of experience and knowledge in the field. No drama, no bs, no cheesy jump scares or Hollywood nonsense. I see bigger things that this will lead to. I'd definitely love to see more in the theaters when this becomes a movie, which I don't doubt it will.",False

15,10,Malefice - A True Story of a Demonic Haunting,mrverheyden,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow Sean it was truelly scary and compelling I jumped a few times when I saw that massive shadow, It specifies exactly what yourself, Dave, Eric have encountered I am overwhelmed on the doco, I am impressed 100% well done It's a must see again and again. It was a incredible journey to your answers to this house...and we were with you all the way..",False
16,10,A must see.,angelblossom-32963,n/a,16/08/2025,"Malefice was a a lot to take in, on a deep emotional level. For many reasons, due to the nature of the evil, demonic, heinous acts that once took place on the land. Watching Malefice was intense, emotional, at times even nauseating. A spine chilling documentary filled with horror, sadness, pure evil & more. The evidence captured, the validation, the clear direct responses, to questions asked. In my opinion, could have a skeptic scratching their head. 37 minutes in, I was crying, due to things being said, you can feel the intensity of all that's taken place, especially during the investigations. Then when Billy a skeptic himself, was editing, he caught something, that sent chills down my spine & a knife through my heart. Growls, that went through me from head to toe, while listening, EVP's that made my heart sink to my stomach. I definitely suggest listening if you can, with headphones. This documentary is real, raw, with Sean Austin, Eric Conner and Dave Spinks, all trying to uncover what happened on this land. To know that Sean Austin did something good in 2015 & this evil sought revenge for years. Shows a true testament to his faith in God & the calling in his life. Especially with Sean going back to face this chapter of his life. This documentary was done so well, with such great teamwork. It belongs on Tv. Without given anything away. I will say it again, a great documentary, showing that light shines through darkness. For no soul belongs trapped especially by a demonic coward. God's love is so powerful. Sean is a vessel that has been called to do God's work. In closing, there's a part where Ralph Sarchie has me filled with tears, as well as another part where Sean decides Eric Conner needs protection. You know a documentary is done well, when you feel raw emotions while watching. That's exactly how I felt watching Malefice.",False
17,10,Buckle Up,ryan-j-birge,n/a,16/08/2025,"A must-see and instant paranormal classic. It was an authentic, on-edge-of-your-seat paranormal thriller that pulled you into the real-life battle between Sean Austin and his all-star team of investigators and an evil demonic entity. The evidence was frightening, incredible, raw, and non-stop. You will be thinking about this one for days after!",False

20,10,BEST Paranormal Docu in years!,jmkost,n/a,16/08/2025,"Passionate, compelling, and quite a back history story to boot. Sean Austin is the new Super Man of the Paranormal. The spirit box sessions are truly the best I have ever heard, and this is not a BS dramatic -may or may not be real investigation. You can literally see the passion behind wanting to help these lost souls. Way to go guys! I cant wait to see what will come from the all of you in the future.",False
21,10,Fantastic!,LoverOfMuttsmum,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just finished watching (a couple times honestly)! I'm glad I purchased it rather than just renting it! Each time I watch I see and/or hear something I hadn't caught the time before. I've been following Sean for several years now. I've ""tagged along"" with Sean on many, many investigations via social media live streams. I've seen Sean's work live & in person. Sean is the real deal! I have seen him investigate some seriously crazy messed up places! I have personally witnessed first hand as he captures some of the best, most insane evidence! This documentary shows exactly how Sean, Dave & Eric investigate! There's nothing fake or exaggerated here! Straight up REAL solid evidence! Evidence that these negative entities DO EXIST! They can and will cause tremendous suffering for anyone who mistakenly crosses their path! I would highly recommend this film to everyone! If you want to see an actual investigation with legitimate solid evidence this is for you!",False

1,7,Much funnier than 'forever',sean-rae,n/a,16/08/2025,"This felt like old school jackass. Flowed alot smoother than the actual movie, the introduction to the new cast went a bit deeper and felt like we actually got to know them a bit better.Be warned, there is a lot more butt stuff in this movie and personally the only time I have ever retched watching a jackass movie is from watching a certian sushi stunt in this one.Very funny, strangely heartfelt, exciting to see where the new cast take it from here with new TV show announced.Peace.",False
2,7,The real Jackass Forever for the longtime fans,TrippyFix,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you've been around since the original Jackass series and love watching these guys for their personalities and chemistry, then you will probably enjoy this as much as I did.If you do not care about the guys, their history or chemistry, but rather just watch some dudes do silly stunts, then 4.0 will probably be more of your cup of tea.Jackass 4.0 was all high budget, polished stunts with little talk. Giving you less insight into the chemistry between the guys, and being less intimate.4.5 is more intimate, focusing on the pranks they pull on each other behind the scenes and watching them having a blast together on low budget stunts. Which feels in a way more pure and true to what made Jackass great back in the days; a bunch of guys with zero to no budget and a video camera, doing silly stuff.On top of that, they have behind the scenes/set talk, with the guys talking about their experiences and thoughts. How ideas came to be, how the movie came to be, the issues they encountered, backstory of the new guys and why they were picked, their very first stunt together and everything in-between.For me personally, as a longtime fan of the guys themselves, this was way more intriguing and in a way nostalgic to watch, rather than just the high budget stunts of Jackass Forever.In a perfect world, I'd like to see a 3 hour supercut mix of 4.0 and 4.5, as they are both good in their own different way and give out slightly different vibes, where one is more ""grand"", a bit more shallow and suitable for new audience, while the other is more intimate/deep for those who enjoy that.I feel like it gave me somewhat of a closure to the original Jackass guys, and a welcoming to the new guys. A smart transition to the upcoming Jackass series reboot, which will probably mainly (if not only) feature the new crew.",False
3,7,Better than the film in my opinion...,luke-mori1986,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't a fan of the theatrical release of jackass forever, I didn't really like the stunts etc and wasn't overly keen on the newbies. I thought this was quite entertaining and enjoyed it more than the actual film.",False
4,7,Simple...,fingazmc,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you like Jackass then watch it, if you don't then stay away from the rating button. Your opinion on something you already don't like; is irrelevant.",False
5,7,More Laughs Than Expected,arated-96629,n/a,16/08/2025,"I see the .5 films in the jackass series as a fun feature length behind the scenes. But this felt like another full jackass film! While there are more failed ideas and behind the scenes chat, I'm surprised at how many stunts that are better than the ones in Jackass Forever here in 4.5.The new cast felt a bit restricted before but this really did feel like everyone at their A Game.If this is where the series ends I'm happy, because not only did they make a great 4th film but they also managed to make the best .5 film in the franchise too. Great stuff!I would love to see a Jackass Forever directors cut with all the things from 4 and 4.5 together. Because the quality of stunts and pranks here are on par with the main instalment. Unlike say 2.5 which did feel like the deleted segments of Jackass Number Two, 4.5 is a solid entry and I'm worried not enough people will see it. Especially after how popular Jackass Forever was.",False
6,7,"Too Much talking, Not Enough Stunts",erasmushurt,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a Jackass fan since MTV and I enjoyed Jackass Forever. There were some funny moments in 4.5, as well. But.after all the talk about how much good footage they had that didn't make Forever, this had way too much talking and narrative and not enough stunts.It was much more similar to Jackass 2.5 than 3.5 in that regard. It's still enjoyable to watch. And I don't mind getting the background, but it was a little disappointing to me.",False
7,n/a,Difficult Viewing,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a big fan of far out stuff, Grindhouse Movies & the general bizarre but Jackass 4.5 had too much close-up HD genital destruction for me to actually face the stupidly large screen i watched it on, some of it is like footage you get on a sick fetish video.",False
8,6,ONE THING MISSING that no one has mentioned...,buddasahn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Besides missing (Bam/Dunn)...terribly...and replacing them with much lamer versions, the ONE thing missing from these films, that 4ever and 4.5 (and to a lesser degree, 3D and 3.5) are guilty of, is the spontaneous bits with ""marks"" being filmed unbeknownst to them for their reaction! Simple things like Preston chasing Wee-man in their underwear, Steve-o/Ehren causing havoc wherever they go,, or Knoxville messing with marks on a golf course or as an old man, are the ""true"" bits that really made these guys funny! It just seems like they've veered away from that and simply replaced it with either pain, male nudity, or trying to outgross ea other. If there's ever going to be a 5th film, they seriously need to go back to their 'roots'! IMO!",False
9,9,These stunts should have been in the cinema version,vince-nymark,n/a,16/08/2025,"This right here is true Jackass, just absurdly nasty, brave and hilarious stunts. I for one thought this felt way more Jackass than the cinema release. There is shown a lot more pranks from on scene, and the stunts that are done felt way more like from what it was in the old movies. There are stunts that push the boundary of each and everyone of the crew in this one and it really helps you connect to the gang. I felt a part of a really hilarious ride and was very pleasantly surprised of this movie, as the .5 movies really just tend to add the their cinema release counterpart. But this movie imo was funnier and nastier than the cinema release.",False
10,7,They're baaaack!!!!!,TheDome81,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you enjoyed the first three movies you'll love this one. It's simply more outrageous and painful to watch than ever. The stunts make you want to buy stock in Ben0Gay! A lot more dick humor but to great effect. As a guy, I could barely get through some of the scenes! Well done, mates!",False
11,3,"Some funny stunts, mostly disgusting and boring",benirohr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Too much of the same disgusting stunts, and too little funny, well though out ideas.The cast is also just too old, it makes it quite a bit cringey.Definitely not like the original jackass movies.",False
12,8,Hilarious,Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,So many good stunts that had me laughing out loud. Commentary added some fun backstory on the stunts and how the movie came to be made. The bouncy house blowing up? Awesome.,False
13,1,Now it s just sad,wildredrose33,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember how this was so funny like 20 years ago. Now it s just so sad. And the ""jokes"" are so bad. They all look just pathetic and sad. For their pride I hope this is the last one. But I don t think you can talk about pride when you see something like this.",False
14,7,I liked this more than the actual film,rws_20,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe clips in this were better than most of what was in 4, I don't know why they just didn't put them in the film instead.I didn't like the film much at all, wasn't a fan of most of the bits in it; it was mainly all just dick and ball stuff, but this made up for a little bit.It was a good combination of stunts we didn't see, some behind the scenes bits and interviews with the cast.There was more creativity in the bits that you see 4.5, and I just found it more entertaining to watch than 4.The skydiving bit at the end was great - poor Dark Shark. And the bit with the bouncy castle as well.",True
15,6,This should have been the main film,frosty-44431,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched ""forever"" at the cinema and although it was alright, something was missing. Now after watching ""4.5"" I much prefer this one as it's the Jackass we all know.",False
16,7,2020-Present needed a well deserved jackass 4.5,markgriff-28758,n/a,16/08/2025,"The guys are back without a couple exceptions and some new blood. I always love the behind the scenes interviews with new pranks. Seeing Johnny Knoxville with grey/white hair really hit me and I'm even more impressed with what these guys will do for one hell of a laugh. I love jackass grew up with it and I can sincerely saw that they will never be duplicated ever again, I really hope that they're physically able to make a 5th film...",False
17,7,As funny as ever,henryporterr,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie surpassed my expectations and I laughed harder at this then any other movie that ahs come out in the past several years. I could have gone without the new cast. Poopies was the best new edition, but even he didn't add much. It seemed odd to dedicate so much time to one of the new cast members dads, when the audience doesn't even know or care about the son.",False
18,10,So much better than the proper film!,Themoviebuff80,n/a,16/08/2025,Now this is what the reunion was meant to be like! Felt much more organic and natural. Laughed so much more than the proper film. The interviews were good too. Just like the good old days!,False
19,7,Pure nostalgia,bgar-80932,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI accidently watched this rather than the movie but overall it's all kind of the same thing this just explains some of the stunts more. They always go a little too over the top with the gross stuff. That said they are still a likable crew and even at this age they still are somehow entertaining. Pontius and Knoxville still say some hilarious stuff when someone is rolling in pain or scared out of their wits. The personalities is always the reason this worked and it still is. They introduced some new guys and I think they were probably featured in the movie more than this and I'm sure I wouldn't have liked them as much but they were barely in this so it didn't matter.,True
20,1,Boring and brainless try-hard entertainment,kim-68630,n/a,16/08/2025,"This really is try-hard entertainment for brainless morons. Funny? Well, perhaps. If you think cancer and starvation are funny, then this might be your cup of tea.Boring in its presentation and with a pervasive sense of ""what can we do now to shock people"". Anything stupid, disgusting and offensive will do. Anything.The next step for moronic programs like this would be actual torture and killing. Animals (if and when permitted) and then humans (if and when permitted). This is actually an indictment on laissez faire capitalist philosophy. Sure, I will do ANYTHING to make money. Amputate my foot? Sure. Burn a chimp? Sure.A terribly sad indictment on what we have become.",False
21,8,I just wish they found a way to address the Bam stuff.,matthewssilverhammer,n/a,16/08/2025,"In some ways, I kind of prefer these Jackass.5 movies to the actual films. The behind-the-scenes, talking-head interview style enhances the documentary leanings of the franchise in super fun & fascinating ways. You get a better idea of how insane it is to make these movies & the tole it takes on the cast & crew. Dark Shark is solidified as king of this production.",False
22,6,4.5,FKDZ,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not as good as previous .5's, just felt a bit more simple and a lacking quantity. Also the whole final bit with dark shark was way too long and really not that interesting. Making that the last thing was a bit of a bummer. That said the credit roll was good as always.There is a bigger focus on behind the scenes stuff, commentary from the guys about the stunts and such. The insights were mostly cool to know but it was meh besides that. Also there were some public skits again but even though I love the events they cause, but the reactions are not movie worthy imo. I guess this made me miss the great reactions from Margera's mom even though those were also overdone.Generally alright. But not so many great skits as previous .5's.",False
23,1,Terrible,susandunlop,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI looked forward to this movie after the last 3 Jackass movies, I loved the show back in the day.This movie was terrible, penis and asshole bits are just not enjoyable to watch over and over, they're were too many and it ruined what jackass was all about. #terriblefilm.",True
24,7,Some of the jokes really are too old,awdboosted95,n/a,16/08/2025,"Overall its well done as usual but I just find they are doing too many of the same things over and over especially when it comes to butt holes, dicks and puking lol. We just don't need to see it multiple times really, once is enough for these types especially in the same movie.They did put in some new stuff, I mean hell even the fear of flying made for decent material, and the conveyor belt a simple idea that worked out okay too. I think creativity was a little too low for this one especially after a 10 year hiatus, and if you are going to recycle old pranks use some of the better ones not just another firecracker in someones butt.Having said all that, it still had my laughing many times, and I have to admit using Pontius's Penis the way they did for the opening scene in forever was great creativity.",False
25,6,In on the fun,inacan-90-894261,n/a,16/08/2025,"It stupid, it's disgusting and it's low brow but you know what they are having fun. You can't help but smile at some points cause they are having fun and you know what WHY NOT? Some parts could have made the movie but I understand how so many are b roll.This is for jackass fans only.",False

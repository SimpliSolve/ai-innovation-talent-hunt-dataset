1,6,"Interesting, didn't need to be 3 episodes",thesuefunke,n/a,15/08/2025,"3rd episode is the best, you can honestly skip to that cause that is where it all comes together. The style of documentary might be the best part because it's old footage, and new footage recreated in the flat all the original footage took place in.As an American, I don't know how much this made news when it occurred but it's interesting the levels of fame it illustrates.If you're looking for a different type of documentary that is kinda cult mentality/ what people will do for a piece of fame / somewhat of a redemption story -
This show will itch that scratch quite well.TLDR: just watch the final episode.",False
2,5,Bloated docuseries that just keeps repeating itself,bczech-46-485595,n/a,15/08/2025,"The current trend of docuseries, covering a single topic over several episodes, has caused series like this one. While the topic is intriguing it appears that the producers felt compelled to stretch this topic, painfully over 2 hour long episodes. In truth, the subject could have been edited down to a tight 60 or loose 90 and, in turn, have been a more successful production.Unfortunately, the direction taken was to repeat footage, interviews, etc. Again and again to fill an unnecessary void in order to achieve 3 episodes. If that was not the case, then perhaps the producers should reconsider there choice in career path.",False
3,6,"""BONKERS!""",paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As Episode 1 of ""The Greatest Show Never Made"" (2023 release from the UK; 3 episodes ranging 42 to 49 minutes) opens, we are reminded that reality TV was exploding everywhere, and the biggest show was of course Big Brother, making stars out of the contestants. One day an ad appears in a London publication called The Stage, calling for contestants for a year-long new reality show. A number of candidates apply, and show up for the first audition... At this point we are 10 minutes into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this mini-series is directed by Ashley Francis-Roy, an up and coming British talent. Here the director reflects on the madness that was Britain in the early 00's, including reality TV. This mini-series looks at how a con-man tries to make a reality TV show out of nothing, literally. One of the talking heads appearing in this observes today: ""Back in 2002 people were more trusting, today it would be called for what it is: a scam."" That just about sums it up. It nevertheless is fascinating ton see how the contestants take it all, and even more so, how they reflect on this now 20 years later. That said, the 3 part mini-series could've probably been deal with in a regular 90 min. Documentary.""The Greatest Show Never Made"" started streaming on Amazon Prime just this past weekend. I read an interesting review about it in Friday's NY Times. If you are a fan of reality TV, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,n/a,Sympathy for the con artist?,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis show ended differently to what I expected.Because it ended with none if the hard questions asked or answered, instead leaving the wishywashy 'explanation' of the pathological liar just hanging in the rooms they recreated.Were the initial contestants a bit stupid for falling for his con? Yes, they were.But their stupidity is forgiveable, especially as they did see through it once confronted with the big 'producer'.Even if I am the only person on Earth to read Mr Russian as I did, I stand by my truth o meter readings, and they are waaaaaay in the red.He wanted to get rich off of his grand idea somehow, and he knew it was a lie from the start.Imagine how much time and thinking he put into the creation of that 6 page contract. Its content alone screams deliberate fraud.Makimg up people as employees in his production company. Yeah, sure, Nik, that was all for a good thing.He was so deluded that instead of saying no thank you to London Tonight he let them interview him and presented the audience with more of his deranged nonsense.How were these people to make £ 100,000 each in a year starting with nothing? Beg some coins and win in a casino? Rob a bank? Marry and then off a millionaire?Nik was not asked that question.I don't even believe him when he says he was homeless.Or anything really.I have known pathological liars and con artists. They don't lie All The Time. They spin in truth, and they are very convincing, and charming, they are lightning quick in adapting their lies.Of course they are all troubled. Everyone's troubled.So I was disappointed that it was not about truth after all.I know all life is about stories, the stories we create ourselves about our experiences and interpretations.But whether you are genuine or not, i.e. Whether you are true to your inner story, that shines through.And Nik, to the very last, was always first thinking about what to say next. 'Humility works best here', was his inside choice. 'Sticking to my story works best here, makes me just seem stupid, not vicious'. A sociopath, was all I thought.I do not care whether I may be a little (not all) wrong there. Maybe he is reformed, or just awkward and still self-delusional. I saw no real contrition, no reality, just a show of reality. Haha.And the would be contestants saying their lives changed for the better? How about it might have been even better without having been conned? You make the best of situations, don't make correlations out of chronological occurances.And at least one person's life was affected negatively.The song at the end was the best thing.Could have been much more real.",True
5,7,Interesting insight into non-materialising Big Brother spin-off,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,n/a,15/08/2025,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulIn 2002, the 'reality TV' craze was riding high, after Jade Goody's victory in Big Brother, but for those who didn't get through to that, an ad was placed in a personal column for a reality show to rival that. A group of distinctive, quirky personalities were asked to give up their homes, lives and jobs for a year to appear on a new show to rival BB, only for the show to never materialise, leaving each of the individuals without their dream moment. Twenty years later, the group are reunited, while the failed producer, who now goes by the name of N Quentin Woolf, looks on.With the recent resurrection of Big Brother, the original 'reality TV' production, on ITV (I think), it's timely that this intriguing little production from Amazon Prime has risen up, documenting a production that wasn't so lucky. It caught my eye to begin with given the dark edge it seemed to possess, given this was a group of people who were asked to give up everything about their lives, but as it turns out, this is a largely light hearted and fluffy piece that looks back with a sentimental glint.The group on display are the usual type of exhibitionists and extroverts, who in one way or another have to show off and stand out, but none are particularly unlikeable or overly narcissistic in any way, and even as their dilemma was unfolding, they seem to react to the situation with humour and resignation, which is much the way they appear in the present, without much in the way of bitterness. The man behind it all, Woolf, seems genuinely contrite and regretful over everything that happened, just a situation that spiralled out of control. The apparent naivety of the participants comes off as a reflection of the time, as one of them laments, a column ad like that in the present day would scream alarm bells, but at the time, it's more conceivable that people could get sucked in.Director Ashley Francis-Roy condenses everything into a neat and succinct three episodes that ensures everything doesn't become overwhelming. It's a fact-is-stranger-than-fiction tale, that is fitting for the modern reality TV obsessed world we live in. ***",False
6,2,"It's stupid, it's boring, and I can't believe anyone thought these nothing-burger contestants had a story to tell",dootmoot,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary has 3 parts. At first I thought maybe it was still currently airing, but after watching it decided it is probably 1.5 episodes too long. The story is intended to to be the retelling of an awful situation that happened to the contestants, so you keep waiting for the other shoe to drop that details the atrocious, but gripping series of events that necessitated a documentary on the subject. Except the documentary never gets to that point and by the end I wound up being extremely annoyed by these people that were supposed to be aggrieved in some way.First off, the pacing and world building / storytelling of this documentary is terrible. Usually documentaries try really hard to have an easy to follow, cohesive story, since the bulk of it would be a retelling through interviews. That concept is thrown in the trash bin, instead mainly focusing on needless reinactments of things that have nothing to do with the topic at hand. Want to see 30 minutes of introductions & reinactments of how people looked 20 years ago & what they were doing BEFORE the story they are supposed to be telling? Or reaction scenes of each person walking into a set design of where they stayed (btw more on where they stayed in a minute)? You'll be in heaven. /sBeyond the sarcasm, it takes until midway through the 2nd episode for the story of the documentary to really even begin to come together. I fell asleep twice in the same evening trying to slog my way through the first 2 out of 3 episodes, but I had reached the sunken cost fallacy, where I felt I should finish it due to the time I'd wasted. And boy, was that a mistake.I've spoken in the abstract, but now it's time to get to the nitty gritty of what this documentary was about.Around 21-22 years ago reality TV was really in it's golden period. The contestants see an ad in the paper for the casting of a reality TV show that says there will be potentially $100,000. The ad is for Nik Russian Productions. The contestants ignore that it's a clearly fake name & sign up. The producer/creator, Nik (Nikita) Russian wants to do a Big Brother (which had just been a giant hit in the UK) meets the Real World kind of show, but one that subverts people's views on work, consumerism, and money. People would sign away a year of their life to live together, work together, and pool their earnings all together to see how much they could make in a year, starting from nothing. A sort of community victory or community failure thing. There were going to be multiple groups of people, with each group living independantly of the others in homes/flats/apartments for each group. They would generally film themselves, instead of filmed by a crew.It's a disaster from the beginning. As one group decides they aren't signing the contract, but are gonna try to shoot the show anyway. ""The contract is, like, 10 pages!!!"" and ""(Nik Russian) will run off with our money!!"" are their complaints. Then, with the way these people describe their experiences, you get the impression that this is like what happened to Nasubi in Japan (a Hulu documentary called ""The Contestant,"" or plenty of Youtubes videos dedicated to what happened to him are worth watching if you've never heard of him), where he got abused under false pretenses for 2 years. You are lead to believe these people were mistreated for months, but the entire experience took 7 days or perhaps less. The entire documentary is repetition of how these peoples lives were destroyed by what this man ""Nik Russian"" had done to them. His crime? Being unprepared and not telling them every little thing about the point of the reality show (which is the case for most reality shows). These contestants that refused to sign the contract, but had decided they were still doing the project anyway, act like they were struggling so much when in reality 7 days isn't even enough time to find jobs and get your 1st paycheck. They say they cut any and all relationships out of their lives for the opportunity, but does it apply if the whole thing lasts only 7 days??Around half a week in, they realize they aren't going to be reality TV famous and get extremely angry at Nik Russian. Nik Russian comes to them saying he's putting everything into the project, too, and asks to sleep on their floor because he's putting all focus into it, to the point of homelessness. They complain about wanting to kill him, actually attempt to kill him, then freak out when he leaves the next day because they think he's ghosted them and is going to steal their money, or footage, despite him leaving his clothes and backpack at the flat (apartment). Also, WHAT MONEY would he be stealing!? I never saw them describe actually getting any jobs during this experience. All they did was hang out together & pretend to be Big Brother by doing a bunch of confessionals. Not to mention all the footage they recorded wouldn't have time to be edited within the time frame they spent within this experiment, or whatever you want to call it.The contestants are mad that they won't be hugely famous, so they set up a scheme to get the news involved and take revenge on Nik Russian (that name always gets me). Nik inevitably comes back, after his afternoon of avoiding them due to one of them trying to kill him. The contestants talk the the camera about how, at the time, they were going to restrict Nik from leaving so the news can surprise him and make him look bad. Reinactment shots from earlier in the series where Nik was painted as deranged, now have context when he is filmed in the confessional doing things that make much more sense when you consider we are shown footage of the group literally surrounding him at all times & admitting that's what they did.The local news shows up with the obvious intention of making everybody look stupid, or in Nik Russian's case, like a villain. The contestants? They are pleased as punch to be on TV, so they are more than happy to follow instructions to create scenes where they look like sad, homeless, idiots (except they are living in a flat, so they can't be homeless. The only homeless one is Nik). Throughout this, Nik says in interviews that he wished the contestants put half this effort into actually making the show work, which I found hilarious. Nik still (naively) wants to salvage the show and takes all the tapes the contestants had just recently taken from the editor. Nik plans on still creating the reality show somehow. This lasts for about an afternoon, when the news segment airs & the 1 person Nik tries to go to wants nothing to do with his f××kup and never speaks to him again.Meanwhile, the contestants are over the moon since they've gotten their 15 minutes of notoriety from the news segment. They are recognized now, for good or bad, and view the segment as a success. They all leave the flat, going their separate ways, and that's basically the end of the documentary.About 10 minutes before the end (which includes a song and more reinactments), as the contestants are all sitting together, one of them finally admits ""we were adults & what happened to us was our own fault. We have to take responsibility."" Another contestant thanks Nik Russian through the camera for making her life better. Like, what?!The contestants aren't interesting in this. A lot of them default to giggling a lot, which is weird for a documentary about being wronged. Nik Russian is the only real interesting piece in this because you kind of want to know what his thought process was, but he has the demeanor of a puppy who just had their nose shoved into the stain they made on the carpet.The set is terrible and overly bright. It looks like someone vomited up colors from early 90s clothes onto everything. Like a child's tv show set or perhaps turned the contrast waaaay too far up.I don't feel for what these people went through. Nik Russian made plenty of mistakes I did not mention. That is because this documentary does nothing well & on top of it commits the cardinal sin of being BORING. How am I supposed to care about what someone does wrong, when the people you're supposed to relate to/support are so disinteresting?Avoid ""The Greatest Show Never Made"" at all cost, unless you have severe insomnia. In which case, happy sleeping!",True
7,1,Booooooooring!,schweinrich,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am almost 20 minutes into the first episode. And I think that is as far as I am going to get.It is so long drawn, and mindnumbingly boring, that it´s impressive. I think they are trying to set the scene, for what is about to come. But get to the point, FFS!I have watched shows on Netflix mostly, before. And some of them suffer from the clear fault, that they are reminescent of when someone has to write a X letters essay for school, but can´t really come up with enough content for it. So it just becomes a matter of being as long winded as possible, without having any actual meat on the bone.And it seems to be the same for this show.",False
8,1,Amazingly boring,germanyjones-58382,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't know how a series or documentary or whatever dismiss was supposed to be.... Can be so simultaneously boring and confusing lol. I honestly didn't think it was real at first.... And it doesn't seem real still. Not sure how adults could have been this stupid. They made choices that most adults would sound minds would not have made.... And then gather together to bully Nick, the so-called Mastermind. And while all this is going on.... It's quite boring. I found myself fast forwarding through most of all three episodes, And then finally just jump to the end of the last episode. Still boring. Lol.",True
9,8,"Started off thinking they were all idiots, but ended up wanting to hug them all, including Nik.",prestonmick-975-597748,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stuck this on while having a slobby Sunday and wasn't expecting much but I'm so glad I stuck with it.A group of people seeking fame and fortune end up leaving home, careers, relationships to be on a year long reality TV show and end up having reality bite them instead.What's great about this show is that it treats everyone with the utmost respect and it really shows. You'll care about them and I love how they recreate the flat while they're interviewing individual 'contestants' now in 2023. And then it cuts to footage from 2012 while they're all in Tim's pad.The final episode is the best and it's fascinating. You couldn't wish for a sweeter group of people who all have big hearts and it's a joy to see.Well done to the team that made this, edited it and put it all together in such a kind, heartwarming way.",False
10,5,Reaility-ception?,BlazinBull00,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA documentary showing a news crew recording reality TV contestants that were tricked into joining a fake reality show. Can't get that anywhere. Slightly negative review because I am left completely unsatisfied. This guy tricked you into leaving your jobs and homes and you let him stay overnight with you and just let him leave? You then just shame him in a news segment? That's it? Y'all are willing to have your lives messed up that bad and just keep going cause you want to be on TV that bad? Maybe that's what you deserve then? Too many questions, not enough answers for a good rating. LOL they just made the bro some tea and complained at him. The Brits went from the largest empire in the world to being spineless like this. Need a better ending! It is interesting to see these people make the best out of a crazy negative situation.",True
11,10,This was not what I was expecting... in a good way!,Unity-division2,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this crazy and bizarre story. If you like really interesting bizarre pop culture stories like I am, you'll love this docu-series.At its core, this story is about the bringing together of some lovely but vulnerable young souls in the strangest of ways...and a few little lies- where the bad guy isn't always a bad guy. Maybe just a broken kid who was trying to make something of his life and unknowingly and irresponsibly dragged others down and under in his wake.A side note, I really loved the production of this show, the recreation of the apartment was so clever and was a really fun way to tell the story. Kudos to the production team for that one.",False

It's worth it.In episodes two and three the characters start to come out more and the tale develops into a very interesting drama.Finally in episode 3 the series builds into a story about young people reaching for their dreams, facing disappointment and then looking back at how our decisions make us who we are.It all came together in a welcome closure by the end.Finally in episode 3 the series builds into a story about young people reaching for their dreams.",False

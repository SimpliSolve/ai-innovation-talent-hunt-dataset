1,8,A True Joy,rvieiradasilva,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I found this modest documentary lying aorund curiosity arose: what an odd pair!It was a very pleasant surprise, content wise, to watch these two icons of human rights interacting and talking to each other, in a very calm and tongue-in-cheek manner.Both come across as two elementary school friends that life had put them apart and meet each other after 50 years; the goofing around and shenanigans come back immediately and the conversations between them, although carrying relevant and deep meanings, are presented in a very light and interesting way.Like I said before, the content of this documentary is masterful and meaningful. The execution, however, is not so proficiently done and presented, with a sluggish pace and lazy camera work.The high rating is given for these two absolute legends of fighting against opression and prejudice.I was taken aback by their levity and hopeful posture in life and it is a great comfort for these troubled times we live in.Strong recommendation for anyone!",False

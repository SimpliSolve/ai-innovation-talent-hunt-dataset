1,10,Great flick about record collecting!,vinyls-49660,n/a,16/08/2025,Great fun film about a quirky guy that travels around the United States looking for vinyl records. Only drawback is that he doesn't go to all the states like mine. No Kentucky!,False
2,10,A record collector's dream documentary,seesoulhq,n/a,16/08/2025,"Record Safari is one of the best documentaries I've seen to date! It brings together my love of road trips and record collecting into a fun, lighthearted story that's entertaining and educational! I learned a ton about vinyl records, got insight into some of my favorite's artists perspective on music and vinyl, and had a lot of fun watching along the way. This is a must watch!!",False

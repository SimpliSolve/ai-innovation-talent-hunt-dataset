1,8,Excellent documentary about an outstanding female chef in her early career,hannesskibba,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary starts with the 2018 youth national Team Championship which the Austria team won and where Agnes is part of the team. Hence she is already at the start an excellent cook.To further progress she decide to do internship in three world class restaurants (2 or 3 stars restaurant) over the next couple of years.Beside beautiful pictured insides from the working environment in those high class kitchen, the documentary covers topics like the impact of COVID in 2020/2021. Other big topics are the future plans of Agnes and how those are in conflict with the typical work life balance / conditions in top class restaurants and also in general the role of women in kitchen who are underrepresented in this industry anyway. All topics are integrated in a nice balanced way.The movie closes with her last restaurant where she (for the moment) finds her perfect environment combining outstanding cooking with a team friendly atmosphere and especially conditions where she feel 100% part of the time without any interference with her gender.The documentary is entertaining and well paced and snapshots behind the scene are intimidate and as said already of outstanding picture quality.I would definitely recommend this documentary to anyone who is general interested in (high quality) restaurants and/or the role of women in the high class cuisine.",True
2,9,Interesting Journey for a Young Chef,meinhard,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a delightful movie. So many movies today are shallow, CGI-laden superhero retread stories that just numb the mind. This movie is completely different - my wife and I really enjoyed watching Agnes' journey of self-discovery told through this film. The filmmaker did a great job in editing - it feels like you are ""right there"" in the kitchen with the chefs. The film takes a few unexpected turns, which makes the story that much more compelling. The film explores work pressures and it's affect, but in a greater sense, humanism and the ability of people to connect on a deeper level. Highly recommended!",False

1,7,Fun but tepid accounts of tripping from major and minor ill informed celebrities,horacewayne,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have loved and used psychedelics for 30 years. I have never been a ""major tripper"", the title reserved for those people that do ""heroic"" doses of psychotropic substances. This was a fun first step that America and the UK needs to bring a mature, responsible attitude towards a subject that has had major effects on human consciousness for 10,000 years. Including psychedelics in the failed ""war on drugs"" has not benefitted anyone.
Sting is incorrect that peyote, or any hallucinogen, contains strychnine. This is an old myth that has been kicked around for 50 years. It is refreshing in our celebrity worshipping culture to realize that ""stars"" are just as misinformed, fearful, fun, cowardly, silly, inspiring, incorrect, woo woo, and adventurous as any segment of the population.
Rosie Perez was very candid and remembers the joy, intelligence, and wonder that psychonauts seek. Ben Stiller is a dud, and leaves a cynical taste for the audience and for commercial comedy. There are many gems here, and for virgins seeking the ""experience"", this flick can have a comforting and positive influence.",False
2,8,Entertaining and Even Informative,caramia2002,n/a,16/08/2025,"While this doc isn't a sober and scientific look at psychedelics, it fulfills some of that in a good way. It uses comedy and satire to make its points. If you are looking for serious information about them, then look elsewhere. While there are some facts here, this doc uses mostly tripping anecdotes from famous people, but also includes a psychotherapist and Deepak Chopra (not an expert on anything, IMO, and the one low point of this doc). It satirizes ridiculous 60s & 70s anti-drug movies and propaganda by winding an LSD After School Special throughout the film, which is as original as these things can be, and very humorous.The filmmakers are careful not to proselytize psychedelics, although they come close, but the ""it's not for everyone"" warnings are here, as well as the usual ""set and setting"" importance. There is emphasis on psychedelics not being the ""usual"" drug you use to escape, but an internal ""trip"" in every sense of the word, with planning and intent necessary.Even though the release date of this is shown as 2020 and ""new"" by Netflix, Carrie Fisher and Anthony Bourdain are both in it. She died in 2016 and Bourdain in 2018. Fisher is really funny, as always, and one of the high points of the interviews. Bourdain just looks depressed, which begs the question of why he was left in this doc. Kind of bad taste, due to the manner of his passing, and affected my rating a little.I think the audience for this is probably people who have experience with psychedelics. Otherwise it will have little meaning. I've had most of the experiences chronicled here, including the cliche ""McDonald's trip"" (I didn't know it was a 'thing'!). Odd to see Sting in a somewhat reflective, very personal state, although psychedelics no doubt have a huge job making a dent in *his* ego. So kind of ironic interviewing him for this doc. The other people are entertaining and usually funny.The animation is very well done and the pacing very good. I have done a lot of psychedelics and was mostly a ""seeker"" with the intent to learn from psychedelics, as are most of the people in this doc. If you are so serious as to be offended by a comedic look at psychedelics...yeow. You have GOT to have a sense of humor while tripping!",False
3,7,Fun but dodged some points,krazy_katherineg,n/a,16/08/2025,"The structure of this documentary reminded me a bit of the zany ""Sack Lunch Bunch,"" but of course it was about a topic more adult. The people and stories involved, and also some of ""The More You Know"" and other educational (?) segments, made for entertaining content that is unlike something I've seen before about drugs. It felt to me like a drug-positivity talk, akin to something you might see about safe sex - ""If you're gonna do it anyway, you might as well learn more about it,"" type of thing.However, ""Have a Good Trip"" seemed focused more on a narrative about drugs being fun, rather than necessarily educating its audience. This is despite multiple personalities interviewed having publicly known histories of drug abuse, and two having not long passed away prematurely. It also felt off to me that a story describing how somebody apparently died during a drug trip, was played by comedians in a goofy flashback montage. And of course, there were some stories about people driving or working while high, and sure, they gained amusing stories from these trips that they got out of safely, but there was no commentary on how they could have affected the people around them.Overall, I enjoyed ""Have a Good Trip."" You should expect (mostly comedic) stories from it, though, rather than anything objective. I probably enjoyed A$AP Rocky's commentary the most, just because he seemed so chill, accepting, and totally aware of the ridiculousness of his experience. I also believe I learned from the show what I might have expected before going in (perhaps reflecting the trips all of these celebrities describe?):
I think if I had a psychedelic trip, I'd probably have an experience like Ben Stiller. So, really, I don't need to have one.",False
4,7,Needed more Adam Scott,Aphex_Bob,n/a,16/08/2025,Worth watching for the LSD After School Special segments with Adam Scott. For a more educational experience watch the Netflix series How to Change Your Mind instead.,False
5,7,Decent but nothing new,QuantumMinister,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fun, entertaining and mostly humorous, but no new information is presented here. The information also presented is limited and non descriptive. It's mostly a collection of fun acid stories from celebrities. I enjoyed the documentary Neurons to Nirvana much more.",False
6,10,Really Wonderful Documentary,atomicis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow! I so enjoyed this ""trip"" down memory lane with some really great storytellers! Told objectively and from first person accounts, it just flew by. So nice to see Sting, eloquent as always but loosened up as much as I've ever seen him, talk about some fun times on his farm. Rosie Perez was another surprise; she looks great and has some cute recollections to tell. A little science thrown in from a doctor studying using the drugs to treat depression and anxiety as well as from Timothy Leary's son who has continued in his father's pioneering footsteps. I had to give it a rare 10/10 because as documentaries go, this should be a template.Netflix has had some real dross offered lately, but they hit it out of the park with this one! Highly recommended.",False
7,7,Funny and dangerous at the same time,Jack_C_,n/a,16/08/2025,"A parade of Hollywood A and B listers recounting their good and bad trips can be self-indulgent. This documentary saves itself with humor and accurate narrative. It strays too much into glorification though.A warning must be posted- much of the true dangers are ignored in this doc. It is not all about joyfully exploring warped and interconnected realities. Side effects include painfully coming down, psychosis for some, and criminal behavior.Not a single burn-out was interviewed. For every Sting, there are ten times as many homeless, dead, or institutionalized users who couldn't handle it. RIP, Anthony B.If you have any suspicion that you have psychological conditions like depression, tend to get addicted to things like video games or crack, or are around people who are not close friends and family, don't do it!Many veterans would also wholeheartedly disagree that a synthesized chemical like LSD is anywhere as safe or helpful as naturally occurring plant based hallucinogens.The positives of psychedelics for therapeutics and education is well documented and it is high time science fully explored it. Just be fully aware of ALL pros and cons before you decide on your own journey.",False
8,9,This is what people need To know,matiasbockerman,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have studied halluciogens - mainly pshycedelics - about 17 years. I have read the relevant forums, manuals, guides viewed documents. I have deliberately taken more or less for 30 trips, grown mushrooms, guided people. Against this background, this documentary is truthful, instructive, and well executed. This can be recommended for people who still believe in the demonization of these substances, as well as for those who are more experienced. This was an interesting experience.",False
9,6,Funny Anecdotes by Tripping Gentrifiers,budanome,n/a,16/08/2025,Half of the show should have focused on those patients who used hallicinagens for therapy. It would be interesting to hear and see the trippings of a former smoker who kicked the nicotine habit.,False
10,4,We don't need this superficial woo-woo comedy,PeaceGuard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst of all, I'm pro-psychedelic availability and use.I could recommend a whole lot of good to superb docs on the topic of drugs. In chronological order: 2001 Shamans Of The Amazon, 2006 Cocaine Cowboys, 2007 The Union: The Business Behind Getting High, 2008 Cocaine Cowboys 2, 2009 NatGeo Explorer S24E05: Inside LSD, 2011 Magic Trip: Ken Kesey's Search For A Kool Place, 2012 The House I Live In, 2013 Neurons To Nirvana: Understanding Psychedelic Medicines, 2014 Cocaine Cowboys Reloaded, 2014 The Culture High, 2015 The Sunshine Makers, 2016 Orange Sunshine, 2017 America's War On Drugs (must see), 2017 Trip Of Compassion, 2019 Dosed, 2019 Fantastic Fungi, 2019 Journeys To The Edge Of Consciousness, 2019 The Mind Explained S01E05 Psychedelics, 2019 The Nature Of Ayahuasca. Also VICE's Hamilton's Pharmacopeia series (must see).This is however is extremely superficial & bland in comparison to other ones. It doesn't provide any particular knowledge, is wrong multiple times, promotes Chopra who is probably the least intelligent person in the whole scientific community, consists mostly of short meaningless insertions of comment and weak humor, mostly completely inaccurate visual effects.Charles Grob saves a bit of rationality within the movie, Sting offers some relatively sensible comment, in the extent he can in those short commentary bits. In general, the strongest part of the entire doc is that it was able to gather some personalities that most of us were unaware have used psychedelics and get them to 'come out'. But most of the rest is just pure pointless garbage.",True
11,8,Well Played,michalbrazier,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerExcellent delivery. True stories reliable if you've been there. Hollywood digs and props all justifiable. Ending credits showing referred facts seals the deal. Winning.,True
12,6,LSD for beginners,afsenal,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the film, various media personalities talk about their psychedelic experiences. Some stories made me smile and cheer up.
I won't say whether the film aims to popularize these substances, but after watching it, I'll want to try it for sure :)
A documentary-comedy film from the category of books by Timothy Laurie, for those who want for the first time wants to get into the world of LSD.
If you are in the subject, as I am, then it's definitely worth a look. But it definitely doesn't pretend to do anything more.",False
13,3,Trip for wasting time,tcmekanik,n/a,16/08/2025,"Actually the topic is an interesting matter but this ain't a documentary. It's more like a bad informercial where some famous people talk about their trip The subtle glorification of their experiience taking all sorts of hallucinogenic stuff doesn't add any value to the matter. At some point I started to think it's more like a satire show but then again the smart funny elements are missing.The only thing I liked where the visual effects and transitions, so thumbs up to the editors.",False
14,7,Something strange.,chubarova,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt looks very strange. Famous people tell about their experience under psychedelics. It looks very interesting, but sometimes I had a thought that film tries to show drugs from positive side. I felt a little bit confused about it.
So, it's good documentary film but it must be watched by teenagers and children.",True
15,6,watch it being high,melissaarevalo-34365,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like to be told, that drugs are cool but then at other times they take you down the line telling you not all the time.
I saw it having smoked weed and it was crazy to see the psychedelic drawings that they put on you haha.",False
16,10,10/10,allagligora,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't say this documentary was as informative as most documentaries I watch, but I just truly enjoyed it. I find it has a tone that is matching the topic 100%. A little wild and fun, yet showing some of the dark stuff too. And laughing about the seriousness of the serious.Life is just life, with too many exciting aspects to sit in depression :DOnly thing that disturbed me a little were the drawn parts. Seriously, ridiculing portrayals of trip experiences and them kinda failing them yourself?.. Hahaha xDI'm grateful to the movie creators! What a nice aftertaste it has left me with :)",False
17,10,I can't explain it.....,mmenendezyj,n/a,16/08/2025,Did anyone watch this on a boom? We started it sober then decided to wait til the right time and turned it off..... lol. It looked normal at first but stuff was popping out haha!!!! Real good insight FR.,False
18,5,Not too informative,hobojones-46516,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOkay, was this satire. I'm so confused as to the point of this ""documentary"". First off did these actors ask a bunch of teens who pretended to do acid what it was like because a lot of what they said is just flat out wrong. The mirror thing for instance is sort of true but not to the extent that they made it out to be but really you just can't make any defined shapes out or see what your eyes look like for some reason. Two, you can't take acid everyday even if you wanted to because you build up an immediate tolerance after the first hit enters your body, believe me I've always referred to it as the worlds cruel joke. I just stopped watching because it was like listening to a 16 year old (with the exception of Sting). I might finish to see if they explain why your farts stink way worse that's the only thing I never understood.",True
19,9,Brilliant glimpse into the world of psychedelics!,the_smiley_oreilly,n/a,16/08/2025,"An incredibly vivid trip (pun intended) into the world of hallucinogens and the effects of psilocybin on the brain via the experiences of some of the most revered figures in the entertainment industry such as Carrie Fisher, Sting, A$AP Rocky, Anthony Bourdain and many more.Both entertaining and insightful as the creators have incorporated in their thorough investigations of psychedelics a wholesome air of comedy, which makes this a must see for absolutely all of you.I do wish that they left Deepak Chopra and his pseudo nonsense out of it though, I'll just never get that dude.",False
20,3,This movie was a bad trip,maka-golub,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'll watch this again...so I can try and find what the point was. It's funny sometimes, but not often to be called a comedy. Educational? Not really, very basic stuff. Thought provoking... probably once for about 10seconds.
I gave it 5 stars midway through the movie, then watched the rest of it and rated accordingly.",False
21,10,good introduction to psychedelics,christinalg-06473,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stories were engaging and lots of different perspectives are shown. It's a good introduction to psychedelics for people like my parents but also had a lot of humor for experienced psychonauts. Focused more on sharing individual experiences than investigating the science or sociology of the drugs. If you're looking for that, I recommend Hamilton's Pharmacopoeia.",False
22,9,A vivid idea of what a trip is like,the_smiley_oreilly,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you have never taken a hallucinogenic in your life and are curious about the effects, this is the best documentary to watch as it gives you on an incredibly vivid idea of what a trip could be like via the experiences of some of the most revered figures in the entertainment industry.Definitely a must watch.",False
23,3,Joe Rogan Isn't In It,johnpwabbajack,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler...and I wanted to start there because him NOT being in it feels weird.I'm not sure how they did it, but the people who made this found an impressively high number of famous people I absolutely cannot stand and then asked them about their experiences with psychedelics.I'm genuinely impressed by this rogue's gallery of obnoxiousness; Adam Devine, Nick Kroll, Natasha Lyonne, Rosie Perez, Ben Stiller, there are more but you get the idea. All of those idiots but no Joe Rogan, who goes out of his way to find reasons to talk about DMT and ayahuasca. And chimpanzees.But the one which stands out the most is Deepak Chopra; if the intention on the part of the filmmakers was to lend some credibility to the recreational consumption of psychedelics they should have kept him as far from this as possible. If Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop somehow attained sentience and took on human form it would be Deepak Chopra.There are a couple of good stories here; Sting, Anthony Bourdain, Carrie Fisher, all of their stories were enjoyable and entertaining. The others range from meh to an obnoxious co-worker cornering you and forcing you to look at pictures of their kids. I get the appeal of having famous people telling stories about their drug adventures, but it comes off as an appeal to authority:""See? These people are famous and successful, they say LSD is okay, so you should agree with them.""Instead this feels like a missed opportunity to actually educate people in an entertaining way, and in the end I think they are just preaching to the converted. I've tried LSD and am open to other psychedelics, so of course I'd watch this, someone on the fence might be tipped slightly in favor, but the people who are against it certainly won't have their minds changed.They do this bit where they make fun of the old anti drug videos from the early 90s, and those are a little funny, but it might have been more effective to cut back on the number of times they do that, then have an actual expert (not Deepak) explain some of hazards of LSD and why those things happen. Instead what we get is a mediocre joke repeated too many times, and end up with a ""documentary"" that doesn't really say anything of substance on an important issue.",True
24,10,"pretty accurate description, based on personal experience.",ivo-ivan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Based on my personal experience, I would rate this very accurate.I guess there are four types of beliefs towards psychedelics.1. they induce some form of hallucinations and then it's ""back to reality"".
2. these substances show us ""the real nature of reality"" while ""normal life"" is set up in a way to ""block"" our senses for whatever reason
3. adventurous mind and ""let's see what will happen""
4. only stupid people would do ""drugs"". These are exactly the type of people who end up on the street shooting needles and doing petty thefts to get their daily fix. It's for stupid and irresponsible people.I think nr. 3 is the most adequate position. personal experiences vary greatly. I find all the advice in the film pretty reasonable, you can tell it's from people who have tried it but not ""studied"" it.Are these substances for everybody, in every context, just like a beer. Hell no.Can they be valuable and give you a valuable perspective on life? Absolutely.Aside from personal experiences, I think what people can learn is that perception can very well be reality and that sometimes fixed ways of seeing and perceiving the world and not necessarily ""the true, the only, the right"" etc perspective.It loosesn the boundaries and opens up space for nore ""nuances"" and for different perspectives.In my mind that's a good thing. Seeint more perspectives is a sign of intelligences, think about that.I give 10/10.",False
25,4,Pretty Bad... Coulda Been Fascinating.,barrywomb,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never taken acid or hallucinogens. That being said, there's always been a bit of an interest there. Basically, learning about it through literature and favorite band interviews for 50 years.I thought this movie would be interesting. I would've rated it higher had it been a straight documentary and discussion with those in the film Instead, they made it so ridiculously banal.The Bad:
Why have the idiotic 'After School Special' thing in there? Not funny whatsoever and, I'm sorry but folks like Adam Scott and Rob Corddroy are just NOT funny, all it needed was Seth Rogan for the ""Why are these guys famous trifecta"". To be fair, Rob was great on the Daily Show...
It was trying desperately to be funny and it was just stupid.Not sure what the point of the film was. If I had to guess, it would've been to kind of show that these are the C-level celebrities that took acid. Sting is not included in this comment, and yet, he's so taken with himself in everything that he does, that he's also hard to take.I was disappointed to see this had Stiller's name on it as a producer as, I think he can turn out some very good stuff, when he wants to.The 'reenactments' also tried to be way too cute and clever. Stop it and just tell me what happened without all the ""hey, look how funny we are trying to be"" stuff. It wasn't funny.The Good:
The stories that these folks were actually very interesting. Even the Peter Max'ish cartoons were appreciated as it just kind of goes with the territory.Some of the incites from some of the speakers were really good. Sting, Chopra, Stiller, Donavan, Silverman, and Bordain rate among the better interviews.Over half of the movie was trying to be funny, and, obviously to me, it wasted my time. The rest was extremely interesting.",False

1,9,Oh those golden childhood days...,Peter_Young,n/a,15/08/2025,"Majid Majidi's Bacheha-Ye Aseman is a fascinating and deeply moving piece. It is a children movie which will be equally enjoyed by adults, and that's simply because it will take any adult back to their childhood days, back to the days when they did something wrong and were afraid to confess to their parents. The film was made with great simplicity and soul, and its impact is perfectly made through the characters of Ali and Zahra, two amazing kids who can set an example to anyone. Majidi brilliantly captures the world of these young golden-hearted creatures. They are smart, intelligent, innocent, respectful and caring. It's quite impressive to see how little kids pay respect to their seniors, what moral values they have, and their tender care for their parents' economic status and daily struggle is particularly moving. More than anything, it is their own sibling relationship which tugs at the heartstrings. Majidi's portrayal of the neighbourhood, the school where the kids study, and their own home, is most lifelike and authentic. Without a doubt, the script is the film's main winner, but the casting is one of the film's biggest strengths. Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi are astonishing in their roles - charming, convincing, heartbreaking and totally relatable. You really feel for these kids and really want to settle their problems so that they can move on. This film is a true example of superb acting by child artists, and it shows how far they can go in their ability to explore the innocent spirit of childhood. Bacheha-Ye Aseman is a wonderful cinematic experience, which must not be missed by anyone. Just go and grab your seat, I assure it will keep you on the edge of it for one hour and a half and will be engraved in your heart long afterwards.",False
2,8,Very Talented Filmmaking!,g-bodyl,n/a,15/08/2025,"Children of Heaven, which is Iran's selection for best foreign film at the Academy Awards, is a very good movie mainly because anyone in this world can relate to the topic of family and showing love to each other no matter the living circumstances. As an Iranian film, it is definitely played safe but a film with such an universal theme and elegantly told as here should really not be missed, especially by movie-lovers.Majid Majidi's film is about a young boy named Ali who accidentally lost his sister Zahra's shoes. But their family can ill afford to buy new shoes, Ali decides to share his shoes with his sister until he can get new ones for her and so he can avoid punishment.The acting is pretty good, and pretty heartfelt. There is no questioning the chemistry between Amir Farrokh Hashemian as Ali and Bahare Seddiqi as Zahra. Reza Naji who plays as their father is also good as the man who is trying to do all he can to provide food for his family.Overall, Children of Heaven is a simple film but it displays a strong message about the bond of family. There are some talented films from the Middle East and this is one of them. It's a strong film about courage and about doing what's right. My favorite scene is where the father and the son leave their poor slums as they head uptown to the rich neighborhoods. This film shows how American kids are vastly different than kids from these parts of the world.....and not exactly in a good way. This film is a little too simple for me, but there is no denying how powerful this film is. I rate this film 8/10.",False
3,10,ENCHANTING & UPLIFTING EXPERIENCE,blue-7,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a marvelous thing film can be. It can touch us and open our hearts to a culture that is both different and familiar to ours. CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, a film by Iranian filmmaker, Majid Majidi, takes us into the world of a little boy and his sister, letting us feel the love and trust that they have in each other. The boy, through no fault of his own, loses his little sister's newly repaired school shoes the day before she needs them. It becomes their secret. They try sharing a pair of his sneakers -- the girl wearing them in the morning and he in the afternoon to school. The wonderful, innocent faces of the beautiful Iranian children and their code of honor, even in poverty, provides the bases for a very uplifting tale of children trying to overcome a crisis. The direction, cinematography, music are all outstanding -- but it is the children that you will fall in love with. Well worth picking up on DVD (though there are no ""Extras"" to speak of).",False
4,10,Wholesome 100% natural cinematic staple -- well-leavened and savory!,ruby_fff,n/a,15/08/2025,"This translates to MUST-SEE! It's a credulous incredible storytelling of a young brother and sister in Tehran, and the adventurous saga around one very important pair of sneakers.The two young actors are amazing -- they play their guileless naïve sensitivity with such earnestness! Central character, Ali, the 9 year old brother, is Mir Farrokh Hashemian, who really carried the film with his legwork, and the younger sister Zahra is Bahareh Seddiqui, who contributed her restrained share of screen presence. The pair is so natural: those furrowed faces, anxious knitted brows -- the range of sad faces the two came up with! The bond between the brother and sister is so warm and joyful - in spite of misfortunes.The storyline is seemingly simple. Such story-weaving knack writer-director Majid Majidi has -- he can make chasing along a streaming gutter into an intense dramatic episode! The story has the texture likened to a Thomas Hardy novel (poverty setting, episode after episode, turn of events), yet such a relishingly simple delivery. He doesn't have to tell it all on the screen -- little nuances and observations suffice.It's heartening to see young children who are polite and respectful to their elders, responsible and caring in dealing with their everyday problems, and not give up -- such quiet fortitude in spite of disappointments, such tolerance of their circumstance yet still able to find joy in little things. We catch a smile here and there, e.g., when they enjoy the impromptu soap bubbles, or when he encouraged his sister by giving her small tokens.This is an absolute gem of a family (value) film. Children's emotions untapped, yet adults are not left out -- touches of  grown-up connections: the parents, the elderly couple next door, the shop-owners, all made this world very real.The camerawork, and the well-designed use of sound mixed with accompanying music (different tonal quality instruments were applied) complemented this cinematic experience. A poetic ending -- there's a serenity about it all.I hope ""Children of Heaven"" will win this year's 71st Academy Award Best Foreign Film Oscar -- it will receive its due exposure and more people will experience this gem.Along the lines of poverty and shoes, I thought of  the Italian 1978's ""The Tree of the Wooden Clogs"" by writer-director Ermanno Olmi. And, on a story with substance and good acting by an Iranian young boy, there's 1989's ""Bashu, The Little Stranger"", by writer-director Bahram Beizai. Both are movies to be appreciated.",False
5,10,Majid Majidi is a genius,MollieEternity,n/a,15/08/2025,"Majid Majidi is a genius. He is a director and actor of great talent. This film presents a sweet story of a brother and sister, their bond and their unique solution to solving the problem of a pair of lost shoes. The child actors are adorable and utterly convincing and the production of the film is of such quality that you get lost in watching it. The story itself is humorous, at times, and inspiring. Though the premise may be simple, each scene is infused with such passion, beauty and emotion that the experience of viewing this film is anything but simple. To all who have yet to view the film, take note of the very last scene.",False
6,7,"""You're not a kid anymore. You're nine years old!""",classicsoncall,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOn the face of it, this is a gentle and warm hearted movie that so many reviewers have detailed already that I won't have to go into an explanation of what occurred. The young actor portraying Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) was quite incredible conveying the emotions involved with losing his sister's shoes, trying to explain the dilemma to her and dealing with the school principal who always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when Ali got to school late.The sister (Bahare Seddiqui) was also quite good but not as accomplished as her sibling. I actually found the side story of Zahra dropping her pen and her new friend Roya returning it to be somewhat more compelling. The subject of the 'lost' shoes never came up between them, even though Zahra saw her wearing them, retrieved from the discarded material at the produce stand. One wonders why the subject never came up; one assumes Zahra was too shy or embarrassed to ask about them.What I'm not understanding is why there wasn't more of a sense of closure for Ali and Zahra over the fate of the shoes. Granted, Ali went the extra mile by entering the race contest and winning, but in this case, it was the father who would inadvertently save the day with new shoes for both of them after earning a good day's pay. There is probably some meaning to be taken from the goldfish ending that eludes me, but it's something I won't dwell on. The film works as a feel good movie for the resolution of Ali and Zahra's plight, but I didn't get a sense of what was so extraordinary in the telling.",True
7,10,A Nutshell Review: Children of Heaven,DICK STEEL,n/a,15/08/2025,"Finally I've gotten my hands on a copy of Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven (not illegally of course, but from the library's collection), and have set aside some time to viewing this much talked about masterpiece. And I couldn't agree more that the film is of great quality. I've often selected titles for my pop to view since he's retired, and have gotten a call from him during a working day that I MUST watch this film. Of course I had to clarify that Jack Neo's Homerun is an adaptation of it, given that he found some similarities in plot, but I must say, any movie is worth its salt if it can move my pops.There are so many things I like about Children of Heaven, and basically, the children Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) and Zahra (Bahare Seddiqi) who play the siblings, will definitely tug at your heartstrings with their innocence. The story goes that Ali happened to lose his sister's shoes during an errand run, and coming from a poor family, that spells disaster. Not wanting to be punished for it, given that both understand the predicament they're in, and not wanting to trouble their parents with yet another expenditure, they devise an ingenious, somewhat mad hat plan, to share their shoes - Zahra goes to school in Ali's, before running back to exchange them so that Ali could attend his classes. And this leads to many comical moments and accidental scenes that will surely make you go ""awww"", culminating in an exhilarating foot race which will put you on the edge of your seat.But the skill here that Majid Majidi possess, is not to sledgehammer these emotions down your throat. Children of Heaven doesn't need to, but has in itself this magic that comes forth through its simple yet meaningful story, and through the strength of both children's acting. I was pretty amazed that both Amir and Bahare have this very charming and natural charisma in fleshing out their characters, their banter being excellent, and at times, without a need for words. Truly, they are the stars of this film, and their abilities will put some established big name actors to shame too. Majid Majidi has created characters that endear, but yet not out- of-reach fictional, as they are easily identifiable given that hey, these are the kind of sibling love, or blood being thicker than water, that almost everyone would have experience, or heard about.Being my first Majid Majidi movie, I'm definitely piqued to want to watch a whole lot more of his films. The movie has superb production values, and like any other foreign movie, opened my eyes to the cultural and physical landscapes of countries that I've yet to visit. What I liked about it also is its showcase of the family, how both Ali and Zahra show this strength in maturity with their helping around the house, and being sensible, well-liked kids. It justifies the number of awards that it has won in festivals everywhere, and if you haven't watch this, please do. It's definitely highly recommended stuff!",False
8,7,"A Nice (Partly Frightening) Movie, But I Don't Get All the Rave Reviews",faterson,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler_Children of Heaven_ is pretty shocking in its depiction of poverty in modern-day Tehran. Well, ""modern-day"": for the first few dozens of minutes in the movie, you might as well be watching a story from centuries ago. The only aspect of contemporary life visible in the frame is a small, old-fashioned TV set; and a radio transistor, like those commonly used 50 years ago, perhaps. Only later in the movie, when the father and son, riding a bicycle, visit ""downtown, modern"" Tehran, does one clearly realize that the movie is, in fact, fully taking place in the present day, although it certainly doesn't look like it to a Western viewer.I may be naive, but somehow one would expect a ""religious state"" to be better capable of taking care of its citizens, so that such extremes of poverty can be avoided. I mean, to shoot a movie in 1997 showing a pair of sneakers as the most precious imaginable possession is just sad. The illusion must be similar to what one used to expect from Communist countries - that they would eliminate sharp class divides within society. That's what Communists used to preach, in theory - but in practice, they failed miserably. Does Iran as a religious society wish to remove such sharp divides? I have no idea, but it was disappointing to see so clearly in the movie that they apparently still exist in Iran today.After I finished watching the movie, I wasn't entirely satisfied. Basically, everything turned out right, as it typically does in fairy-tales. OK, but it also lends a ""phony"" aspect to the movie: the movie pretty much tells the viewers, ""Ah, it's not really as bad as it all initially seems. Just lay back and enjoy the movie - everything will sort itself out eventually, so there's no reason to get upset. You viewers can go ahead and live your comfortable lives just like before, and you can forget about everything you saw in this movie because, see, these folks are eventually capable of resolving all their problems by themselves.""But is that true in real life? And is it a hallmark of a cinematic masterpiece to make viewers comfortable? To be honest, I'd rather expect the opposite effect from an outstanding work of art. _Children of Heaven_ appears to be soothing the viewers' bad conscience: ""We don't really care about all the terrible struggles these poor folks experience on a daily basis, but that's OK, because they can sort it all out by themselves at the end of the day.""There's a fairytale-like atmosphere around _Children of Heaven_; the adults in this world appear threatening, but eventually, as it turns out, most are just kind-hearted folks. In the midst of the harshest conditions, people are, in their depth, mostly good. That's a nice, heart-warming theory, but is reality quite as simple? The movie makes it seem *too* simple and allows the viewers to conclude that no measures need to be undertaken to help those around the world who are currently suffering. That's a less elating, and one might almost say - a kitschy aspect of the movie: ""The good will prevail, it always does, so why should I worry or do anything about bad things that exist in this world?""There's another kitschy aspect in _Children of Heaven_, as there often is with children's movies: the two children in the lead roles are just too cute. What if the two kids were ugly? Would there still be a movie?Finally, the movie was a bit frightening to watch from a European perspective. I find even ""liberal"" European schools too suffocating for a free-thinking spirit, but that's nothing compared to how Iranian schools are depicted in _Children of Heaven_. One is reminded of army barracks rather than an educational institution. The ""uniforms"" worn by everyone except males in the movie (headwear by all women, the exact same clothing by all school kids...) strengthen the ""military"" impression generated by the movie. Uniform clothing - uniform thinking...Does _Children of Heaven_ deserve its Oscar nomination? It's a very good movie, beautifully shot and apparently realistic, showing you both sides of Tehran as if you visited it in person, but the movie's praise is perhaps exaggerated. It's very much a movie in the spirit of De Sica's classic _Bicycle Thieves_, and it goes to the credit of _Children of Heaven_ that one can pronounce this comparison without blushing. Still, to me, it lacks the intensity and artistry of the classic - unlike here, I never for a second mistook _Bicycle Thieves_ for a fairy-tale while watching it.",True
9,10,excellent children sentimental drama,ravishek6,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI was in nexus of one movie on star movies two days before named. ""children of heaven""...that was accidentally..because the movie was at late night...& i do like to watch the movies at prime time & mostly sci-fi, action, comedy & some time sensitive...but This movie I came in to watch was great experience.It was a persian, iranian, English language film...It is a story of two children Ali & Zahra, very briefly crafted, & what a language that was, very simple & polite, even a moderate English speaking person can also understand it.Such a sentimental story...Ali takes his little sister Zahra's shoes to the shoemaker to be repaired, but loses them on the way home. The siblings decide to keep the predicament a secret from their parents, knowing that there is no money to buy a replacement pair and fearing that they will be punished.They devise a scheme to share Ali's sneakers: Zahra will wear them to school in the morning and hand them off to Ali at midday so he can attend afternoon classes. This uncomfortable arrangement leads to one adventure after another as they attempt to hide the plan from their parents and teachers, attend to their schoolwork and errands, and acquire a new pair of shoes for Zahra. Zahra sees the shoes on a schoolmate's feet, and follows her home, but the two soon become friends.Ali enters a high-profile children's footrace in the hope of receiving the third prize of a new pair of sneakers. He accidentally places first and wins another prize instead.The film ends with Zahra finding out that she will not get a new pair of shoes, but there is a quick shot of their father's bicycle at the end of the movie that shows what appears to be the red shoes Zahra had been focusing on earlier and another pair of white sneakers, presumably for Ali, whose old sneakers were torn from so much use. The film ends with the final shot showing blisters on Ali's feet. Some versions include an epilogue revealing that Ali eventually achieves the larger-scale success of having a racing career.that brother-sister moments were made us very calm & heart pulsating..great to watch...I will not miss the chance if I get to see it again",True
10,10,Fantastic motion picture,phosgene7,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the great movie I never saw before, which is directed by Iran ppl. probably I did't see more Iran movie cos I am fresh movie fan. And I believe that I should pay close attention to this country and her culture in the future! I am strong interest in this kind of movie, such as PEACOCK (chinese movie, is great as well). The whole story is focus on one pair of lost shoe, which belongs to Ali's little sister. All people is so kind that I can't help to cry almost! when Ali and his sister found the lost shoes eventually, wore on other schoolmate girl's foot, they traced her and found the truth! she is a poor girl as well. Then both of them never say anything and go back to home! what is a moving scene! I addict to this kind of movie, such as PEACOCK, which is made by China. I recommend that all fans should take a look this movie. And you can understand well what's happening at that years in China. I heard the director's name-Majid Majidi. I thought he did other good movie cos I never got chance to investigate on the internet! I want to write my feeling and comments on the IMDb first!",False
11,9,A piece of neo-realism as moving as The Bicycle Thief,piapia,n/a,15/08/2025,"Neo-realism was the school of cinema developed by the Italians just after World War II. From 1945 to approximately 1954, directors like De Sica, Rossellini and Zampa delivered  masterpieces like Open City, Paisan, To Live in Peace, Shoe Shine, The Bicycle Thief, Umberto D and Miracle in Milan. But the Italian (not the World) audiences got tired of seeing poverty and everyday problems and demanded something more sophisticated. Federico Fellini added imagination to the down-to-earth themes of Neo-realism and gave the world a new concept of cinema. Neo-realism, it was said, was proper to poor, not to wealthy cinematic industries. It this was son, Iranian Director Majid Majidi accepted the challenge, and has made Children of Heaven, the most moving and perfect piece of neo-realism that has been filmed outside of Italy.  The story is much like that of The Bicycle Thieves: it's a pair of shoes that are stolen. But Majidi has provided us with the most wonderful performances from children that the screen has ever seen. A great story, magnificent color and camera work,perfect actors both children and adult, and a firm direction that never misses an opportunity to engage and captivate the audience.  I have never seen a better motion picture from that part of the world.",False
12,10,Precious movie with an universal message,azrailangelo,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen so far. It has to be seen by everyone, who wants great cinema with great messages. Nowadays there are very few films which combine these two.You should watch this beautiful example of modern cinema with your whole family (especially with your children) and not only once, because it will change your view on life, on property, on family and on friendship! This is the first movie by Majid Majidi I watched. Therefore I can't say anything about other films he has made, but I can say this about ""The Children of Heaven:""Mr. Majid Majidi Thank You very much for this masterpiece of cinema!""",False
13,10,A Social Director,emilato,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nobody like Majid Majidi has recreated poverty and suffering of millions of people all over the world. His films show in a very natural, but dramatic way how poverty and culture and domination, both work together to cause social pain.He is a genius in the way he shows peoples feelings.The flower pot in the kitchen of the film Baran shows a clear example of his enormous power to show feelings.I hope the people in the industrialized countries learn more about other countries and poverty and suffering through films like this one.The color of Paradise is also a master piece of art.",False
14,10,Every scene is breath-taking; a masterpiece in cinema,valky,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is amazing.  Every character is fully dimensional, which is a rarity and it's a smart trick to keep the audience fully involved throughout.  Majidi does this with our young protagonist and his sister, and he does this, amazingly, with those with smaller roles. His technique for making the kids speak volumes (tho they are obviously not ""trained & accomplished"" actors) is the use of their facial expressions, Parviz Malekzaade's attractive cinematography, and the musical score. What captivated me most about the film was that the story was told so well.  It's hard to find a good story teller, and it seems that we can trust Majidi with this.  The story is of a boy and his sister struggling with diffrent problems, but they become each others saviors. I can't think of ONE person who would dislike this wonderful gem.",False
15,7,"Sweet, though not very profound, movie",grantss,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ali has a problem. He has just lost the prized pair of shoes of his sister, Zahra. He tries to find them but to no avail. Now he and Zahra have to share shoes at school, a situation which causes all sorts of problems. Ali comes up with other plans to get Zahra a pair of shoes. Meanwhile, Zahra thinks she may have tracked down the new owner of her shoes.Sweet movie from Iran. The spin-off events from the loss of the shoes and the adventures of the kids are quite entertaining. Also a great, warmth-filled reminder of life's simple pleasures and how things which may seem unimportant to one person in one culture and/or socio- economic sphere can be vitally important to someone with different circumstances.Not particularly profound though. The movie doesn't really come up with much in the way of profundities or even a powerful conclusion (in fact, the conclusion is fairly weak). It's a simple, linear story with very few frills or great twists, told engagingly and with great warmth.The movie was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 1999 Oscars, losing out in the end to Life is Beautiful.",False
16,10,A Most Uplifting and Unique Experience!,Tony-Kiss-Castillo,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's easy to understand why there are OVER 200 reviews of ""Children of Heaven"". Normally, that simple fact would have dissuaded me from adding a review of my own. But, as I'm sure many others have felt, this film so overwhelmed me with joy, I feel obligated to share my feelings with all those who would listen!After watching ""Children"", it occurred to me that I have, perhaps, never seen an Iranian film I didn't like!This film celebrates youth, the essence and innocence of youth, with an unencumbered intensity, with such unpretentious panache, that any comparison to any American film that makes an effort along these lines, regrettably, seems rather empty and almost laughable in comparison. The sibling rivalry so familiar
to us in the majority of American movies is replaced here by a warm, caring fraternal relationship based on love, consideration, self-sacrifice and mutual respect. These little Muslim children demonstrate the most exemplary of true Christian behavior in both word and deed. I hope that here, in America, this opinion can be stated clearly, in a review like this one, without fear of provoking a mindless outpouring of reactionary negative clicks!I feel more than a tinge of remorse, even embarrassment, when I think of the millions of Iranians who see far too many American films where children are portrayed too often as selfish, wise-cracking, foul-mouthed, bullying, disrespectful, totally inconsiderate little brats. And to make matters worse, this abhorrent behavior is more often than not viewed as copasetic, or worse, even exemplary, something that kids today often strive to imitate!Some people have commented that ""Children"" seems incomplete or leaves them feeling somewhat bewildered or left them hanging in mid-air. All I can say to them is reflect carefully for a moment on the value systems of the kids in the movie ...maybe then you will be able to feel much more satisfied with this great cinematic experience.ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA! 10***********",False
17,4,Severely overrated sentimental fluff.,adam3000,n/a,15/08/2025,"In a sea of beautiful masterpieces from Iran, somehow this piece of drek got snapped up for the kind of distribution and attention that dozens of other films deserved. It's the cliched story of a poor brother and sister who have to get by with one pair of beat-up old shoes between them. Direct references to Bicycle Thieves abound.Samira Makhmalbaf's The Apple, one of the greatest films of modern cinema, is still unavailable on video and has been seen by almost no one in the states. Until Kiarostami won the Palme D'Or for Taste of Cherry, his films were only seen by a handful of lucky individuals who made it to the right film festivals. Samira's father, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, whose films make it to theaters but never with too much attention, and other great artists like Bahram Bayzai and Daryush Mehrju'i, are overshadowed in America, somehow, by Majidi. Despite having made what might be the most significant Iranian film in history, The Cow - shown at Venice in the early 70's and introducing the country's cinema to the world - Mehrju'i and Bayzai - considered to be their best by the Iranians themselves - collectively have fewer films available on video than does Majidi, in his relatively young career.Children of Heaven is the only Iranian film that I have seen which seems artificial. The performances are not good, the plot seems hackneyed and contrived, and it's sentimental - there's lot of crying and yelling. The children aren't real people, but little angels beset upon by this harsh life.

24,9,Heaven Can Wait.,morrison-dylan-fan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen reading up about the Iran New Wave (INW) one of the first titles I found out about was Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven. Intrigued by the details,I was disappointed in being unable to track a good print of the movie down. Checking on what films were about to go from Netflix UK,I was thrilled to find an INW film,that I hoped would be heavenly viewing.The plot:Going to get shopping for his family,Ali puts the new shoes his dad ordered for his sister Zahra on the side for a minute.Coming back with a shopping bag,Ali finds that the shoes have been taken. Thinking of the money issues facing the family,Ali tries to keep things hidden. Secretly talking to Zahra,the siblings make a deal of each taking it in turns to wear Ali's old sneakers between classes. Believing that this is the new path they must walk,Ali is thrilled to learn of a contest that might let him make things up to Zahra.View on the film:Keeping the camera at Ali and Zahra's level,writer/director Majid Majidi & cinematographer Parviz Malekzaade masterfully cut rustic INW Neo-Realism with the dramatic heft of the Sports Drama. Keeping costs as low as possible by shooting on location, Majidi gives the side streets of Tehran an earthy atmosphere brushed with lingering shots breathing in the daily life of the family and small tracking shots getting beneath the busy streets of the town. Stepping into the ""sports movie"" Majidi balances the earthy setting with elegant slow motion that brings out the loud gasps from Ali in his desire to make up for his mistake.Lacing a bond between brother and sister,the screenplay by Majidi gives an extraordinary richness in the daily lives of the family,as Majidi brings to light the smallest moments between the family,from Zahra and Ali writing less than secret notes to each other,to Ali having to run out in the rain to put his torn sneakers in the family shoe area. Joining Ali in putting running shoes on, Majidi wonderfully skips over Sport movie clichés by keeping Ali's contest firmly linked to the family troubles that give the film a touchingly poetic final note. Criss-crossing school runs under the noses of their mum and dad, Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi give magnificent performances as Ali and Zahra,thanks to Seddiqi giving Zahra a taut sharpness, whilst Seddiqi gives Ali a nose to the grindstone determination to find some heavenly footwear.",True
25,7,Theme: How is success defined?,gentendo,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerExamining the main theme of this film through the window of another culture showed me that the Iranian ideology is not fundamentally different from our own. In fact, the theme I extracted demonstrated that we share more in common with each other (in terms of the goals we are attempting to achieve as human participants of life) then not: Although adversity and other desperate circumstances seek to thwart man's journey to succeed, man is not only endowed with specific problem-solving capabilities but also the potential to triumph over any obstacle thrown his way.Using the contextual tools in connection with this theme, I seek to examine the following question: How does the hero act in this story? The main character, Ali, is faced with many difficult situations which strongly motivate him to act and provide solutions for. After accidentally losing the shoes of his sister Zahra and realizing the poverty conditions of his family, Ali is challenged with solving how he and his sister are going to get to school with only one pair of shoes. His solution: They can both share a pair of sneakers. Once her day is done, she can rush home and give the sneakers to him. Unfortunately, she arrives too late and causes Ali to be late for his schoolthus creating another problem. Ali develops another solution: His love and care for his sister's welfare causes him to enter a foot race where the runner in third place receives a new pair of sneakers. Although both second and first place prizes are more lucrative, Ali only cares about the happiness of his sister. This was an interesting characteristic of the hero of this culture as contrasted to the hero of an American culture. American heroes are usually determined by how prestigious/strong their image iseven if it be at the expense of another. This particular culture depicted its hero as a weak (small and simple) boy whose primary concern was family. Traditionally speaking from an American perspective, the main character of this film, Ali, would not be considered necessarily a hero. Why? Because he doesn't win what he intended to win in the race. This led me to ask the next question: How is success or failure defined in the story? Success, as defined in the eyes of this culture's hero, is not success unless it benefits the whole rather than the individual. In other words, success is not something to be hoarded to oneself but rather shared equally with others. Ali wants to share his success with his sister by finishing in third place, thereby winning his sister's joy, but instead wins first place. The result of him not enjoying his ranking is terribly ironic when compared to how success is defined in an American cultureif you're not first you're nothing. Rather than benefiting the whole (Ali, his sister and family), Ali reluctantly benefits only himself. As stated in my theme, Ali had the potential to triumph over this particular obstacle but instead received an outcome that ran contrary to what he had desired/intended.Overall, Ali is a unique and culturally diverse hero that demonstrates the tool of activism to help support the lives of his family members. Although he is young and helpless, this does not thwart him from helping and providing solutions to those around him who are also helpless. This idea is demonstrated in two specific scenes: when he helps his helpless father in promoting gardening services in the city, and, when he retrieves the sneakers from a rainstorm outside for his helpless sister who is frightened to retrieve them herself.",True

1,7,For Die Hard Cult Fans Only,thalassafischer,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a well-made and comprehensive look at the cult classic Clue: The Movie (1985) which has been my favorite movie since I was a kid. And they talk about that, calling Clue a ""babysitter movie"" and how one actor showed it to his own kids on VHS, along with showcasing the younger adults who have elevated Clue from a box office bomb that generated a post-theater following to a real cult film.It's a good doc but not great, probably because this documentary didn't get made until 2022 since several participants ranging from actors to producers have long since passed away. This production probably should have been made around 2005 and yet there's the longer view and additional information in retrospect that supports the main interviews.",False
2,6,"A good start, but needed tighter editing and focus",hoover-rachel,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm such a huge Clue fan, I really did love most of the interviews with people directly involved with the film. I wish there had been a couple more interviews like that with cast/crew members vs. Convention clips. Overall it needed a tighter edit, even with the existing interviews.The second half really started to wander, and I think that is where the film struggles with its identity. Some of it is very much a documentary, but other parts are more of a vlog or compilation of the cult impact. It should have focused on being one thing. I think it would have been wonderful to have short clips of fans quoting their favorite lines or saying what so inspired them running underneath the closing credits. But too much time was dedicated to interviewing content creators I've never heard of, soundtrack companies, or the filmmaker reading from the Clue storybook at the end which was unnecessary. It felt like filler.So I'll give it a decent rating for the interview content it did provide, but it needed more focus and better editing to be the kind of documentary I wanted for Clue.",False
3,7,Fantastic deep dive,JCaseyChapman,n/a,16/08/2025,This was so lovingly made. Dives DEEP into every aspect of the film we all cherish so much. The physical media release also contains tons of extras. Very happy to have seen this. If you love the film - you must see it.Great interviews included with every member of the cast still alive and archive videos from those who have passed on. Some great tidbits like Carrie Fischer originally cast as Miss Scarlett and Leslie was cast as Mrs. White.Goes through how originally the film flopped but caught wind and is now a cult classic.Fan documentaries are always a treat to me but this one is better than they average one you'll find on YouTube. Highly recommend.,False
4,1,Very disappointing.,Dodge-Zombie,n/a,16/08/2025,I wanted to love this so much but just couldn't. There are very few of the main cast actually being spoken to and a huge chunk of the documentary is just videos from conventions or interviews with people who had absolutely nothing to do with the movie.Yes unfortunately some of the cast are no longer with us and that is very sad as obviously there is no way to interview them or get their input.Clearly most of the people who are however just simply didn't want to be involved in this which is unfortunate also.You may find out some information you didn't previously know but it will be very little.I'd recommend just watching the movie and pretend that this isn't even a thing.,False
5,4,Focus!!!!,marleycroy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Clue!! Like recite the lines, kinda fan but this? Not great. Who cares about how a record label started that puts out a Clue soundtrack? The director did a terrible job of editing the people being interviewed. Didn't dig deep into the movie like they could.And spent way too much time on these satellite projects and theatrical productions, merch selling and you tube people.Considering they had interviews with Leslie Anne Warren and Mike McKean I really feel like they could have dove in a lot deeper. I really had high hopes but clearly this is a first time documentarian and it shows.So disappointing.",False
6,8,Fun lightweight retrospective.,tronvszombies-1,n/a,16/08/2025,Cool retrospective on a movie that's nearly 40 years old. I used to watch the movie on VHS a lot as a kid so this documentary has some cool info on this comedy gem (I'd taped it off the telly with Louis Malle's Crackers on the same 3 hour tape way back in the late eighties). Most of the cast and crew get to reminse and offer some geek trivia. I'll admit the movie is flawed from the fact that you can't guess the killer as there were 3 endings. But as a comedy it works. This documentary digs deep into the production and is a cool addition for fans of the movie. Definitely a passion project and that comes through in the feature. Lots of clips and cool film connections from the cast and crew. A nice companion to the movie.,False
7,3,"Interesting material, but oh so boring",stsorrell,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember going to the theater with my closest friends to watch Clue. We all agreed that it was a a good movie but we wanted more. We thought it could have been better. The cast was superb.But, this documentary ...while it does give interesting information about the making of the movie, it was presented in such a boring manner that I quickly find myself falling asleep. The interviews were at times very long and lacking in depth and substance.Although this documentary was made in 2022, the quality is so low it looks and sounds like it is from the 80's. I understand it might be the director's first project, and yeah...it shows.I got up to grab a snack and hit pause. When I noticed it wasn't even halfway through, I decided to cut my losses and switch to something else.",False
8,10,Really lovely,annamariemonette,n/a,16/08/2025,"Look, if you LOVE Clue this is a lovely cozy documentary. It's not perfect, but it's very charming. I wish the director had less bits about themselves, and had more polish; but they managed to capture some real gems in honor of the people who made Clue.I really enjoyed hearing so much from the director, and I loved hearing about who they considered to play the roles originally. I also thought there was good tea about the Hollywood system; and I feel like the director hit every part of what goes into making a movie.I really love the movie Clue and it's clear the director does as well! Lovely.",False
9,3,Could have been great,audrichardson,n/a,16/08/2025,"The best part of the doc are the interviews from the cast. Unfortunately, they are surface level and way too few for the length of the film. So much time is spent on where we saw the actors before this, the score, the record labels that decades later decided to produce/distrubute the soundtrack, fan reinactments/thoughts, that we never get any detail about what filming was actually like, no behind the scenes footage or stories other than they all loved each other. Weirdly, when they mention that Lee Ving's voice was dubbed in the movie by an uncredited actor no one says why that was - little things like that which could have been more interesting were left out.Overall too much emphasis on the peripheral and none on the filming of the movie. Of course many of the cast are no longer with us, but others apparently just didn't want to be involved. Overall it was a nice idea but pretty boring, unfortunately.",False
10,1,Don't do it,mgreene-83697,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a fan of documentaries on the process of film making, especially for movies that I love, but this one sorely missed the mark.While some of the lacking can be understood with the passing of main characters, I think most would have passed on sitting down for an interview with someone who has no credentials and is filming on a 480p setting on their phone.If you're looking for something worthwhile stick to The Movies That Made Us on Netflix or something else that puts some real care into the production rather than someone filming in their car for half the movie and turning it into a nearly two-hour production when it should have been 45 mins with anything people would actually care about.",False
11,2,Production quality makes it unwatchable,scottnascar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Video is overly compressed, audio sounds like they used a $10 temu microphone, compressed the audio mix, then compressed the whole movie again so they could make it fit on a cheap thumb drive for distribution.I mean pirated movies shot over someone's shoulder in a theater on a handheld VHS camcorder that you could buy on the street in any major city were more watchable than this. We bailed out after suffering through 10 minutes waiting for it to get better. We were hoping they were doing a schtick and it would jump to a nice smooth & crisp image with clear audio, but if they did that, it happened too late.",False

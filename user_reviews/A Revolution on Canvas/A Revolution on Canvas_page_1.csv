1,4,Lacking substance,tbuestrin,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an exploratory journey of a woman's parents it's fine. But there's very little there to interest the viewer. Sure, his art was something that went against a revolution...but this documentary really doesn't dive that deep into it.I do think that there are two points that she could have pressed her father about but either chose not to or just didn't want to really explore some of the dichotomies in her father's mind.First...he lived under the Shah. While far from ideal, Iran was for the most part free and prosperous. Yet uncontrolled, fanatical youth sought change and got what they deserved...a tyrannical, religiously fanatical society that still suppresses art, freedom of expression, women's rights, etc. It's stated either by the director or her father (can't remember which), that the outcome isn't always better than what you started with. That principle should have been explored deeper. What does her father really think of his actions prior to the revolution and then what became of Iran?Second...you have a man that championed the cause for communism in the late 60's and 70's, yet lives in New York and enjoys all the benefits of the most free nation in the world. I want to know where his mind is now regarding that? Why didn't you move to China or Russia or any other totalitarian regime and practice what you preach? Did he find he was wrong? It's an awfully hypocritical existence with that past.And therein lies the problem...those ideas are just passed over without exploration. This is where this film falls way short. A nice look into her family...but anyone can do that and release it today.",False

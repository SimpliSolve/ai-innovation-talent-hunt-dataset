1,5,Egotistical Sports betting addict turned hero,DougRates,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSo this guy was smart enough to hit multiple banks over the course of some years and never get caught but was such a sports betting addict he could never use his money to properly support himself/ his family. On top of that once he cut his monitor and went on the run why would he not hit a few banks and actually leave the country. Strange to try and get in the mind of this guy.I try to leave my bias disdain for chiefs and chiefs kingdom out of it but they it didn't help they idolized this degenerate.The bail bondsmen was also a strange guy, seemingly only giving him a shot because he's a chiefs fan. Then is shocked when he went in the run when all signs pointed to him doing so.Over all a decent doc but I wish they would've dove into his backstory more, and maybe got an interview after he got caught the final time.",True
2,7,A perfect pic of too many we all know....,notoriousvic-44206,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMy hope is someone sees this & realizes they are on the route to do something like this guy. There is a great piece of fandom: being part of a shared love, a feeling of understanding due to shared love of a team, & even the positives of their success or failure.Then there are fans like this guy, who has everything in his entire life tied to a team's success, where he puts all his money on an uncontrolled outcome because if blind allegiance, & his entire life is about being a fan. It is terrifying & happens all to often. Being a fan is incredible, but when it gets unhealthy, you have to look figure out what is important.I feel bad for the other ""super fans"" on here who believed in him & said he was innocent, he was not. Hopefully they can see past his awful decisions & be better in their lives. There is a lot to learn from this, the fake stardom of social media & the even worse plan to gamble your life into doing something just flat out ignorant. I hope it keeps one person from being ""Chiefaholic"", then it is worth it.",True
3,7,"Not an NFL fan, but it was a fun movie.",KOSListed,n/a,15/08/2025,"Interesting movie. It was nice how it told the version as people saw it from multiple angles, from the police, detectives, bondsman, tellers, etc. It spent a lot of time on the bondsman, Michael Lloyd, Seemed like he was working harder to catch Xaviar Babudar, than the police. Maybe the police couldn't offer much screen time since other crimes don't stop just because you're on a bank robber case.I almost liked watching live reactions from Xaviar more than seeing a game. Hell, he should have had his own Youtube from the get go, he might have made millions in ad revenue.I went into this not knowing anything about his story. I have a best friend loves the Chiefs so we watched it together. One of the most interesting / fun movies I've seen in 2024.I hope there's a follow up, with more input from the detectives, lawyers, and Xaviar.",False
4,n/a,"110 minutes of garbage, 10 minutes of actual story",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Pause if you think this ""documentary"" is a fascinating story about a football fan who dresses like a wolf, committing crime. Here's a more accurate breakdown of this waste of time:15 minutes: A dork with braces likes the Chiefs and dresses like a moron.15 more minutes: The bail bondsman is hungry when he gets dork out of jail, they seem to fall in love.20 more minutes: The dork likes to make sports bets so let's hear him talk about bets and then watch him watching TV (I know, exciting, right?).15 more minutes: Footage of dork driving a vehicle while talking about him being a football fan.15 more minutes: The dork is real nervous about the upcoming Super Bowl.10 more minutes: The dork talks about how his family could use the money if he wins two big bets, despite evidently being homeless.**Notice we haven't discussed ANYTHING to do with a crime yet.10 more minutes: The Chiefs played the Eagles in a Super Bowl (not the one the lost in 2025, but a different one).10 more minutes: This 30-something nerd with braces has a crush on an NFL quarterback and his fat coach.10 more minutes: Let's watch the dork yell at the TV while watching the Super Bowl.This about covers it. If this ""documentary"" was boiled down to the time actually discussing this ""big crime"" it would be a 10-minute infomercial.Oh, and I hope you love shaky, dizzying camera movements by an amateur videographer. It's enough to give you vertigo.This thing is a waste of time. Just do an online search for a story about this crime and you'll know way more than you would from watching this scam of a movie.",False
5,8,Made a hero out of a lazy jobless gambler,cmpresador,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe doc itself was decent worth watching mostly because of the stupidest bondsman I've ever seen .a bondsmen put up his 80 k bond because he was a fanboy of this gambling degenerate.this doc made it look like babadur was a victim his whole life when the problem was babadur was just a lazy degenerate gambler who didn't want to work and robbed banks just to be able to support his gambling habits and lifestyle.it was funny how babadur bragged about throwing down huge amounts of money without any hesitation when in fact all he was doing was using stolen money.the fact that this guy only got 17 years in prison for what he did is a travesty to the judicial system.they make it seem like poor babadur was a super fam. Who was robbing banks to support his family when it was to support his lifestyle and gambling habit.and the bondsmen is literally goner puke if bondsman ,he deserved to have babadur break bond especially the part when they showed him at his office the day he got babadur out you could see babadur looking at him as his next victim when he was talking about how young the guy looks .you get to see the con man in action.",True
6,3,The definition of America,rsanchezmur,n/a,15/08/2025,"Brainless people defending a criminal for the only reason of being a football fan. What can be more stupid ( American) than that?..Chiefsaholic dives into the bizarre intersection of sports fandom and criminality, highlighting the blind loyalty of some football fans. The documentary paints a stark picture of brainless idolization, where fans defend a criminal solely because of shared team allegiance. This absurdity, emblematic of certain American extremes, prompts viewers to question the boundaries of devotion. While the subject is captivating, the narrative exposes a culture where rationality is discarded in favor of tribal loyalty. A sharp critique of misplaced priorities, it's equal parts fascinating and frustrating.",False
7,3,These people...,dmaxhamblin,n/a,15/08/2025,"Funny to watch d bags and the way they live when they claim they are a big fan.But does he think he's getting away with all of this while his bond bailsman tries to fool us with the toupee?The story was fun and it was entertaining. Too many people cursing on purpose because the camera is on them? The real stars of this show are the other people who think and ""get sick"" because they can't find the Wolf dude? Lots of head scratching. Also it's funny to see the fans who probably before before the chiefs won a Super Bowl, were just normal New England fans, and now Brady is gone, these people chose the Chiefs. Entertaining.",False

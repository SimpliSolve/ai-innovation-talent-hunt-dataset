1,8,Great special,Kingslaay,n/a,16/08/2025,"A surprisingly insightful and well-crafted documentary. The Untold Story of Mary Poppins dives beneath the surface of the beloved Disney film to explore the real-life tension between Walt Disney and P. L. Travers. It's fascinating to see how the magic of the movie contrasts with the behind-the-scenes creative struggles. The interviews and archival footage add real depth, and Emma Thompson's portrayal in Saving Mr. Banks feels even more meaningful after watching this. A must-watch for Disney fans and film lovers alike. Not just fluff-this special edition offers substance, nostalgia, and a richer understanding of a classic. 8/10.",False

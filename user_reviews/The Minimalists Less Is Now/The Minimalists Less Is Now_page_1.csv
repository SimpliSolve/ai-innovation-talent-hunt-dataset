1,5,Really left me wanting more - no pun intended,mxsuba26,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really enjoyed their first film and book - a great analysis of consumer culture, mindless spending and why less can be better. But this new film was not all that different from the first one which made it a bit of a disappointment. This new movie covered the back-stories of Josh and Ryan which was done in the first film, but now done again in a more updated manner. it also covers the reasons for minimalism again addressed in the first movie. If you saw the first movie, you already knew all of this.What it adds is new testimony from several people who adopted this lifestyle. They range from 17 to 67. However, there was not enough there to really get into why these people did it, how they did it and the outcome. It was too brief. The movie is not even a hour long so more could have been added. I would have liked to have heard more from the 67 year old baby boomer since that demographic would seem far less likely to embrace this kind of lifestyle change. That could have been a really fascinating part of the movie that built on the first film where the message was preached on a long road trip across the USA. Also, how many people adopted this philosophy but gave up on it? Some people like their stuff and its not clogging up their lives. That would have been interesting to see. I would have also like to hear Josh and Ryan talk about their homes far more. You see Ryan's but not much is said about it. How about interviews with both of their wives? They are both shown but say nothing? Are they onboard with the lifestyle.The movie also has commentary by ""experts"". There is the anti-capitalist woman from Greenpeace who blames consumerism on capitalism. Not exactly true. Capitalism has been in this nation since before its founding and this consumer consumption mania is a far more recent trend - maybe about the last two generations only. What is the cause of this trend that some in recent generations need to find fulfillment in stuff rather than faith, relationships, family, pursuit of knowledge, work, etc? That was not addressed very well. The WWII generation and the early baby boomers were far less consumer oriented due to what they experienced growing up. They were frugal. So what changed in the country? It cannot just be attributed to advertising and capitalism. Something else is at work here that is driving it. They also have Dave Ramsey in several short segments where he is more focused on avoiding debt rather than promoting minimalism. Dave Ramsey is anything but a minimalist. I watch his show. He is great on personal finance advice. He also claims he owns $300 million in paid-for real estate, has a very successful multi-million dollar business, a numerous cars and collections, and multiple homes. So why pick him to talk to? They also mention that people buy things mainly to impress others. That is a big overgeneralization. Not everyone does that. People buy things because they enjoy them and are not trying to show off at all.I was really hoping for a lot more in this new movie. But if it is your first view of the Minimalists, then it is all new. Hope the guys do another that really builds on this. They are good presenters. Also, this film made by Matt D'Avella shows that independent film makers can do work that rivals the corporate media. Very nicely filmed.",False
2,5,Over produced and lacking impact.,dcsimo,n/a,15/08/2025,"This felt like a cheesy Hillsong sermon. Originally these guys came across as authentic, now they look and sound like influencers. The monologues we're bizarrely overproduced and I found myself tuning out repeatedly.",False
3,7,What's wrong with simply talking?,scrow-10954,n/a,15/08/2025,"Although I'm 100 percent in alignment with the basic message, I think as a documentary film it's very confused and frustrating. The basic issue I see is that it is presented in a ""Ted Talk"" monologue heavy style which comes across more as ""presenting"" versus simply talking to camera. It felt like a sales presentation not a heartfelt sharing of experiences even when dealing with issues like the death of a parent and the impact it had. I guess in some ways they ARE selling (their books, events etc) but, to me, the awkward format is hindering that goal not supporting it. As a video producer I know first hand when a video camera is brought into the situation how people are so nervous to do the most simple thing in the world which is just to have conversation - reciting memorized speeches to camera or reading off a teleprompter doesn't come across as genuine for the vast majority of people and this film is a great example of how NOT to produce a documentary.",False
4,n/a,S I M P L Y disappointed,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,I had been a fan of The Minimalists for years since they launched their first website. I used to be excited for their blog posts and updates but a lot has changed since then. This movie is nothing more than an extended version of their TEDx talk. It is made of scripted phrases that they've kept repeating for years. I know they've got corporate background but life is not a corporation! It all sounds fake. One guy trying to sell us his recipe for success using his mom's death. The other one is simply not convincing with how fake the words sound in his mouth. Pure cringe at times. I'm not saying this as a hater but as a disappointed fan of something that used to be original and helpful. They just turned it into a product and production while mass consumption is what they've said to be fighting with.,False
5,7,"Great concept, poor ""theatrical"" speeches",robertomarin,n/a,15/08/2025,"Really liked the concept and connected some disorganized thoughts I already had and now m going to take real actions.About the documentary itself, I think the speeches soundest really fake. The way they moved theatrically and connected they sad stories didn't convinced me at all.Anyway, good material overall. Inspired me.",False
6,3,"If I had a DVD of this show & got into Minimalism, I'd trash the DVD first.",TreeFiddy53,n/a,15/08/2025,"3 stars only for the people that had to listen to this BS being filmed because they had to put up with it.
There are two narrators and the show ended up being more about them and less about the concept itself. Netflix is usually great with docs, but this one...smh! Whatever happened to just sit down and say what you have to say? The dialogues in this show felt very manufactured and artificial, with perfect pauses between words, great cinematic lighting and camera work. Sounded more like a fake TED talk minus substance.
Missed opportunity. There are a few good quotes and if you take out everything else, this would be a 5-10 min documentary. Watch it when you're doing the dishes/cleaning.",False
7,2,Little authenticity and to blown up,dloaders,n/a,15/08/2025,"Really liked the first one. But this one just feels meh. It felt like if the protagonists were declaiming a poem and not speaking about real life. Would have appreciated a more in depth before and after comparison of one or two real life people that made the change, rather then just little clips of a lots of people saying things without knowing their context.
Love the subject and the guys, did not enjoy the documentary.",False
8,10,Does this add value to my life?,bksummitt,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMinimalists Josh and Ryan share their own stories of their life-changing journeys from lives of excess to that of minimalism, asking of every thing, ""Does this add value to my life?"" Abundantly clear is their message that more stuff does not equal happiness.Personally, this helped me in my focus to declutter my house and my life. It was just the encouragement I needed to take a closer look at all the ""stuff"" in my own home and see that things have no value if I don't use or appreciate them.Watch LESS IS NOW and see if you aren't looking around you to see what you own that really adds value to your life and what is really weighing you down.Great quote: The more action you take, the more you want to take action.",True
9,1,A pretentious repeat of previous doco and talks,maccas-56367,n/a,15/08/2025,"How can 50 minutes seem so long? Just when I thought these guys couldn't become anymore pretentious, they go and one-up themselves.They have somehow released a clone of their previous documentary and TED talks. They both stand and talk more about themselves and their lives than they do anything resembling minimalism. It's an astounding level of self-indulgent detail. This means I'm now equipped with more knowledge of the drinking habits of Joshua's dead Mother (she preferred Milwaukee's Best beer) than I do about the minimalism movement itself.I was motivated to declutter my place prior to watching this. Now I feel like holding onto everything just out of spite for these guys and the way they presented this ""documentary"". I use the term ""documentary"" very loosely, because this mostly resembles some kind of ad for themselves and their blog than it does anything else.Throw one item out each day for 30 days and see how it feels. There, I saved you the trouble of enduring this.",False
10,8,More Americans should watch this!,ayushparasar,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't understand the low rating; it explains how Americans are suffering from 'stuffitis' and resist change.This is not a perfect documentary, but it gives insights and ideas on overcoming your need to own more and more. I loved that idea the other guy implemented - pack all your items into boxes as if you are moving out, then in the course of the next few weeks, take out just the items you really need to consume (it starts with your toothbrush, a towel, few utensils etc. ). The guy found out that by the end of 3rd week, almost 80% of his stuff was still lying in boxes.One other thoughtful point this raises is the spectrum of our comparison. Back when there was no social media, we compared our living standards with our neighbourhood, which in most cases, doesn't vary too much. But today, we have more access to the personal lives of actresses and famous people. We compare our clothes and our stuff with them, which is not a very wise thing to do.We need to be serious about minimalism. Hyper-consumerism will lead to the doom of our planet.""The consumer world understands that if I can get you to choose before you think, I'm gonna get you to buy things you do not need.""""We misplace our desire for belonging and satisfaction by buying more stuff.""""What you don't want in your life is this endless horizon of aspiration. 'I just need a bit more of this or a little more of that. I need more success, more income, more wealth, a bigger house, bigger car, bigger this' because that's just an endless black hole.""""When we get all of the things that we want, we tend to be wrong in the predictions that we made about how happy we would be because the brain normalises those things.""""The reason the message of minimalism is so powerful is because we're bingeing on all the wrong things, and we're dying of hunger for the things that really matter.""",False
11,7,"Great, but not as easy as portrayed",Shereen74,n/a,15/08/2025,"I always thought and still think that minimalism is great, and is something that I would like to achieve one day or at least try. They are asking me to let go of stuff to be more happy, but doesn't me throwing away stuff just contribute to the increased waste out there, and I get the point of giving away things, selling, or donating to charities, but not all of us live in a huge country where there are always people willing to take what you no longer need or want let alone to pay money for it. In my opinion starting minimalism should not be with getting rid of what you have but living with it and accepting that you don't need more. To not overspend on items that will not add value. And I honestly do believe stuff do bring happiness but to some extent ofc, not to the extent where we are in deep debt, unhappy, and can't even enjoy what we just spent money on. I don't believe minimalism is something you can achieve overnight, or even weeks, it's a mentality, it's a lifestyle and a routine of thinking that you have to teach yourself, and just like anything else there would be days where you'd want to go back to old habits. For most of us people that can't do this just by watching a documentary or getting rid of things overnight, It would be nice to have a program that takes us through the steps of doing so and learning to be not only happy with less but more environmentally conscious, as one tiny person occupying this earth, I can't imagine the amount of waste I have created and I'm yet to create, which is deeply sad but true.",False
12,4,This is a documentary about Joshua and Ryan - not about minimalism; pretentious,galkowskit,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you want to learn what minimalism is or how it can help you, you won't get this from this documentary. This feels like the rehash of the first one, and it's basically a retelling of the TED talk that you can find on YouTube. There is nearly nothing new of substance in here, unfortunately.The documentary starts by selling us a premise of ""you'll learn why less is more but for that, you need to learn our story first"". But the fact is we never get past their story, I was listening through stories of Josh and Ryan and was waiting for the ""actual documentary"" to start. But it never starts.It touches multiple issues, it feels like it lacks substance and direction. This is a documentary about Joshua and Ryan - not about minimalism, keep that in mind.The camera work and the choice of secondary guests is great, and I wanted to see more of that and more of them. Josh and Ryan, despite being prominent figures in the minimalism scene, are not relatable for most viewers.Unfortunately, the criticisms from the first document, are even truer in this one and both Josh and Ryan often feel like they are humble bragging their wealth, six figures, their cars, or houses and telling us how awesome it is when you decide not to have it. I believe they are honest and if I ever have as much as they - I will try to live within my means. It feels very pretentious.While I understand the message - don't buy a BMW on credit if you can't afford it - most people don't have the luxury of NOT taking debt to own a house or a flat.If you wish to learn about minimalism: I highly recommend Matt D'Avella's YouTube channel (he is ""behind the camera"" in this one), the TED talk by The Minimalists or even the first documentary, not this one.",False
13,7,"If You Didn't Enjoy this Film, then You Were not Part of the Target Audience",noahmcintosh,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before I address anything else, I am not a film connoisseur. And I very rarely write reviews for the movies, series or documentaries I watch but after watching this doco in full length and checking out the reviews. I was kind of saddened to be frank.Lots of 1 to 5 star reviews talking about how it's too similar to the previous doco with Josh and Ryan. And sure I can agree with some of the points brought up, hence my 7 star instead of 10 star rating, BUT! I genuinely enjoyed this film! I enjoyed it because I love these guys, I love learning from, watching and listening to Matt, Josh and Ryan because they seem like nice guys who've helped a lot of people. And for that I am invested in new content they put out.My assumption on the kinds of people that the boys had in mind while making this documentary are two very different people.
The first person is just like me, very invested in Matt, Josh and Ryans content. They love to look at all the big projects they put out because it gives them a motivation boost to keep on top of minimalistic habits.
The second person is someone who has heard little to nothing about minimalism, they stumble across this film either randomly or maybe they heard about it from friends or family. And as they watch it, they learn about the entire concept of minimalism and the benefits it can provide to the ones who practice it. In my eyes this second film actually talks more about strategies to kick-start your new lifestyle. That would be very helpful to this person.If you didn't enjoy this new documentary, it's likely you are not either of these people.",False
14,2,What is happening,meghosterman,n/a,15/08/2025,"Why are they each taking turns performing monologues? Why is Dave Ramsey here? Why are we hearing SO many of the same stories as the last documentary? It seems like Josh runs the show and is SUPER into himself, to the point of being dogmatic, and Ryan is just along for the ride. I really don't understand why this movie was made.",False
15,7,Much Better Thab the First!,Sam_Palmer_1,n/a,15/08/2025,Wow! This was honestly leaps abd bounds better than their first attempt... I was very impressed! It touches on so many reasons why we should all be a little more minimalistic! #LessIsMore,False
16,4,Missed opportunity,edwin-wks,n/a,15/08/2025,"This does not add any further value to their 2015 documentary. So by their own principle, this follow-up should not even have been made.Instead of delving into their personal journeys towards accumulation and subsequently minimalism, they could have done better by discussing the psychology behind accumulation. This was briefly mentioned as companies exploiting people's psychology to get them to buy things.If they want people to do the reverse and turn towards minimalism, the obvious angle would have been to take a closer look at the vulnerability that causes people to compensate with accumulation. Basically they should have invited a psychologist to discuss Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.Once our basic physiological and safety needs are fulfilled, i.e, food, water and shelter, people need a sense of love and belonging which then enables them to achieve self-esteem and ultimately self-actualisation. These are the needs that marketers exploit. So the question is not ""How might life be better with less?"", but ""What is truly missing in my life that I have been trying to fill with stuff?"".",False
17,10,Interesting questions to ask ourselves about life,faer_kr,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is about two of the main exponents of minimalism and they tell their stories of how they came to these decisions in their lives.
Quality.
Entertaining.
In 50 minutes they change your perspective on consumerism, the American dream and those things that one has always considered important to live.
How large companies encourage us to want to have and buy more. From the false satisfaction of happiness.
It shows in a timely and assertive way what it is and gives you the steps to apply them in your life.
I have even left the challenge of carrying it out.
The script is wonderful.
The re-enactments and dramatizations in place.
It also raises those things that in life we can consider important to us.
Throw many questions so that in your everyday life you find the answers.
If you are one of those who frequently buy things, this documentary is for you.",False
18,7,The documentary is minimalist as well,pablo_moriano,n/a,15/08/2025,It's ok living with less. Touring with a car instead of using airplanes and trains. Using a few clothes instead of a whole wardrobe. I get and share the point. It's ok living in a tiny house instead of a manor. Use and consume less and you'll be happier? I guess yes...,False
19,1,It is ALL about them!!!!,jfullersloane,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was really excited about this coming out but it was a tremendous let down....after hearing their collective origin story a million times I was hoping that they would move on and take their philosophy and methods to real people....a la Kondo...but no, it is really not helpful to the rest of us at this point....like how do they live their lives how that they have kids? We never see the real practice put it place as an inspiration for the rest of us. Missed opportunity.",False
20,9,'I had everything I ever wanted. I had everything I was supposed to have.',keithsim-37661,n/a,15/08/2025,"What is it about? The 'Minimalists: Less is Now' is a movie about, you guessed it, 'minimalism'. It's based around, advertising, the want for more stuff and getting rid of said stuff. It follows Joshua Fields Millburn and his best friend, Ryan Nicodemus and their story of how they became 'minimalists'.I would recommend this film. It's a very nice way of checking up on your own life and what needs to change about it in order to make you happier and have a cleaner home! Of course I don't have a very clean bedroom but that's just me!'Minimalism' is more than just not owning much. For example, In the film, they showed that it's more of a life style and a mindset than just not owning much.'I had everything I ever wanted. I had everything I was supposed to have. Everyone around me said your successful. But, I was miserable.' Why I like this quote is because, it touches upon the feel of needing something to quote another quote ""...to make you happy"". It also touches upon how he had everything that was supposed to make him happy but he wasn't. In fact, he was miserable. Even though buying stuff feels good, it isn't always good for us or the environment and the film showed that 'minimalism' is more than just not owning much. For example, they showed that it's more of a life style and a mindset than just not owning much.Review by Phoebe S. (Age 12 yrs.)",False
21,6,To people who only think about shopping on social media,MK_Movie_Reviews,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've just finished watching this movie on Netflix.Too much shopping and consuming never leads to happiness.These two men became minimalists through their own experiences.And they could see what was really important.The documentary conveys their real-life experiences.I also never stopped wanting things until 10 years ago.I kept buying and buying cosmetics, clothes, etc. And still wanted more.Even though the room was filled with many things, for some reason it was unfulfilled, I was concerned about what other people had.One day, my husband saw a large number of cosmetics, he mumbled,
""What are you going to do when you only have one face?""His logic was correct.But I became grumpy.A few years later, I was searching the Internet all day for new cosmetics,
I felt like I had no idea what I was doing.I realized.I am happy to have satisfied my cravings for only a few days.After a while, I want something new again.Then I search the Internet all day long.I have decided to stop shopping because it is getting ridiculous.When I shop, I ask myself one thing.""Do you need it?""
Do you really need it?If you think you need it, no problem buying it.But do not buy it if you ""want"" it.Now I have a simple life.I threw away everything I didn't need.In the movie they said you can recycle or give to others, but I think it is best to throw things away.But I think it is best to throw things away because giving unwanted things to others will only change their places.Memorable clothes from your childhood, school test papers, etc.You can take a picture of it on your smart phone.In the movie, they said that memories exist in the mind, not in things, and that is true.You will be surrounded by only the things, people, and things that you need.Then, there is no waste, and life becomes truly productive.Shopping takes time and wastes not only money, but also the most important time of your life.So now is the time for everyone to live a simple life and become a minimalist.No one is happy surrounded by many things.I recommend this movie to women who think only about shopping on social media.",False
22,1,The same documentary remixed with slightly worse cinematography,timurtaimur,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Minimalists have really become the self-reboot. Their podcast and initial documentary was a breath of fresh air but as their podcast rolled on it became repeated material lacking originality. The same goes for their new documentary.This seems like a money grab and it could have provided more depth to the idea of minimalism yet it stayed walking along the same road it started on.There are moments in the documentary where they talk directly to the camera in a presentation like manner, though you can tell they're acting. It is poorly rehearsed and turns out, it's just the same material from their first documentary, their podcasts and their books.You're probably best to watch their first documentary. 'Less is now' is a watered down version of it. I give this a 1/10 simply because it's almost a word for word copy of the prior documentary.",False
23,n/a,The sad story of people wanting to belong,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the sad story of people wanting to belong. Too uniform, too average, too not special. But at least they can follow Marie Kondo and stick it to the consumerist scourge.",False
24,7,"""We either change by design or by disaster!""",artlabhastings,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a really good documentary based in America about minimalism and 'stuffitis'. 'Stuffitis' is a type of 'disease', it comes from when you hoard a lot of items and how people buy too many items when they don't need them! I suffer from it a little bit, not too much but a little bit. I have not a lot of stuff but not nothing either. The best part of the film was when they were talking about 'stuffitus' because it was very interesting. How an average person can have that much stuff!The film was well edited and used really good angles. My favourite quote from the film was ""We either change by design or by disaster"" because I am a designer and sometimes designs can be a disaster!! I would definitely recommend this film.

25,4,Painful Watching the Monologues,michael-misner,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a shame to write this because I really like Matt D'Avella's Youtube channel and the first documentary, but I could hardly make it through this without turning it off. The 'minimalists' are painful to watch talking about their upbringing and doing these cringe-inducing monologues/poem-readings looking into the camera - it seems really self-centered to focus the documentary on them. I really wish this had featured Matt instead of Joshua and Ryan. I did enjoy the inclusion of Dave Ramsey and the woman from Greenpeace.",False

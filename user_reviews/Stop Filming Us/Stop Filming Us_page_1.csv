1,8,A thought provoking film about the ethics of aid,severajaaho,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stop Filming Us is a meta-documentary about representation of aid receiving subjects. While dealing with heavy themes, it has a lighter side to it through the banter of some of the characters of the film. The film raises questions about the ethicacy of western funded development aid and how it is implemented. Questions rise about inclusion, accountability and the economic system behind aid. Recommended for all those who have worked in this ""industry"". The film is made in an interesting way, mixing different styles of filmmaking together and including bits from other directors work as well there.",False

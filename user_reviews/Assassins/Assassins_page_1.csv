1,8,Keeps you fully engaged right till the end. (THE PROJECTOR SG),adityakripalani,n/a,16/08/2025,"The pace of this film is like a crime thriller. And it gets you emotionally engaged but also engaged in terms of thrill. You want the girls to do well. And time and again, the idea that women pay for the crimes and power trips of men comes to mind. Thoroughly enjoyed the film and went home thinking about a lot.",False
2,7,Cinema Omnivore - Assassins (2020) 7.2/10,lasttimeisaw,n/a,16/08/2025,"""ASSASSINS relies on lawyers' proofs, journalists' notes to elucidate and earmarks most of its volume following the trial of the two female ""assassins"" (one Indonesian, one Vietnamese), which is at first designated as a show trial, with pencil sketches in lieu of actual court footage. While it is clear as day those two girls are duped, they were led to think they were merely performing a video prank, what sticks in one's throat is that the Malaysian legislature is resolute to use these two innocent pawns as the whipping boy, which really stokes one's indignation. Then turnabouts crop up, indignation subsides, but justice is far from prevailing, instead one can only wheeze out a dispiriting resignation when it is up to political pressure to exculpate the voiceless and downtrodden. Plus, one advise, girls, please smarten up, retaining some common sense in whatever gainful activity you are pursuing.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks.",False
3,7,"""Assassins"" written by Gregory Mann",gregorymannpress-74762,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Assassins""In 2017, Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of 'North Korea's' leader Kim Jong-un, was assassinated in the bustling departures hall of 'Malaysia's International Airport'. The spectacularly brazen murder happened in broad daylight, filmed entirely by security cameras. Footage showed two young women approaching Jong-nam from behind, covering his eyes with their hands, and pressing 'VX', the most lethal nerve gas on earth, into his eyes. He stumbled away and was dead within an hour. But if the murder was extreme, the story that came next was even more bizarre: The two women who killed Jong-nam claimed they had simply been hired to pull a video prank and had no idea what they're really doing. 'The Malaysian' government scoffed, arrested and imprisoned the women and put them on trial for murder, facing execution. But was their outlandish story actually the truth? And would anyone believe them? ""Assassins"" travels from the sanctums of 'Pyongyang' to the rice fields of 'Indonesia' and 'Vietnam' to the courtrooms of 'Kuala Lumpur' to tell an extraordinary tale of manipulation and subterfuge in the age of social media. A masterful investigation that offers an unprecedented look at the real story of Kim Jong-nam's murder, ""Assassins"" is the wildly improbable tale of a calculating dictator, a nefarious plot, a very public murder, and two women fighting for their lives.
Siti is represented by 'The Gooi & Azura' law firm. They've a contract with 'The Indonesian' embassy in 'Kuala Lumpur' so any time an 'Indonesian' citizen in 'Malaysia' is on trial facing the death penalty, they get that case. Doan's situation is a little bit different. 'The Vietnam Bar Association' ended up hiring a team to represent her, three different lawyers in two different firms. Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, the main character in our film who's her representative, is a big-time lawyer in Malaysia and in death penalty cases specifically. We feel that Siti's and Doan's lawyers don't get enough credit for how brave what they're doing actually is. They're two of the only groups to publicly point the finger at 'North Korea' in a way that 'The Malaysian Government' would not, in the way that other foreign governments would not. It's almost as if nobody wants to take on that assertion, to say clearly that even if these women were the assassins, they're not the masterminds. Siti and Doan are from different countries, they've different backgrounds, they've different educations, it's really chilling, the idea of what might have happened to them. Worldwide almost everyone presumed that Siti and Doan were guilty, that they must have been part of this regime in some way, or that they're paid assassins. No one would ever jump to the conclusion that two people could be tricked into pulling off a major political assassination. Everybody on the ground thought that they're going to be convicted, the odds were so stacked against them. So the more we realized that they might be innocent and the further it got into the trial and the more likely it looked that they're going to be executed, the more heart-wrenching it's.
Somewhat morbidly we assumed that because they're going to be convicted and sentenced to death. One of the more heartbreaking parts of the film is when Doan says that the world used to be pink to her and now she won't trust people in the same way that she did. It's so sad because that's robbed from her, why shouldn't she be allowed to be trusting? But this film illustrates how dangerous the world can be if you're too trusting. Every time we follow the women at trial, day in and day out, the women are immediately escorted onto the elevator and up to the courtroom. And one day the elevator isn't there on time so the women have to wait a second and the camera is able to get this single shot of Doan clenching her fists with her handcuffs on. That shot gives us goosebumps because you can just feel what she's feeling. Her hands are bound behind her and she's feeling so much emotion and that's how she expressing it, with these hands that she can't move as she walks into a courtroom where she listens to a trial that's not in her native tongue and faces the death penalty. The film creates a real sense of apprehension about whether Siti and Doan will be found guilty and put to death. The nexus of the film is the exploitation of young women. Even though this story goes in the most warped, bizarre, perverse direction, in the end these were women who were exploited because of the circumstances that they're in, who were vulnerable. And that's happening worldwide.
Kim Jong-nam was assassinated in February of 2017. To go back and look at history, that was Donald Trump's first full month in office. Most Americans, remember it as a huge news story the day that it happened, but very quickly it subsided in 'The American' news because so much of the airwaves were dedicated to Trump. The assassination became one of those stories that everyone remembers happened but they don't remember exactly what happened. They remember bits and pieces, they remember that it was something sensational. People say, weren't they female assassins? And then they've some crazy version of how the women killed Kim Jong-nam, and those stories are always very elaborate and wrong. We've heard poisonous lipstick, we've heard darts, we've heard guns; everything but what actually happened. We didn't have that big-picture view of the arc of Kim Jong-un's rise to power and what role Kim Jong-nam's assassination played in that rise. There's a theme to the whole story about vulnerability and the exploitation of young women; it's almost as if they've to force themselves to be gullible because they're so desperate to survive and find a way forward. Anna Fifield, who's the Beijing bureau chief of 'The Washington Post', published a book last year called 'The Great Successor', which is an amazing account of Kim Jong-un. We feel like he's often seen as a caricature, he's laughed at, Trump calls him 'Rocketman', and Anna's book really traced his pathway to power in a way that treats him seriously. When we read her book, it's like a missing link from the film.
The story feels so bizarre, and so distant that in a way your first thought is that you don't relate to these women. And then as you dig deeper into it and you realize exactly what happened to them, you recognize that this could have happened to anybody, that this appeal of fame and opportunity and a better life, particularly when you're more vulnerable, could lead you to do things that others may see as ridiculous. When you're hoping so much to find a better life for yourself and you're presented with something that seems like it will give you that, of course you're going to want to do it. And also they've seen it happen successfully to other people around the world, people who had found fame and fortune with social media and Internet opportunities. So it didn't seem far-fetched that it could happen to them. What's so interesting about it's that in the end it did bring them fame but for the worst possible reason, for a crime neither of them knew they're committing. To see them toward the end with all of these cameras is just so ironic because in a way that's what they both wanted but certainly not under those circumstances.
That's something that we're always batting around. And there's going to be no answer. No one will ever know why it was done in such a spectacle. There are various theories around the personality of Kim Jong-un, who loves the world of pop culture and spectacle, that perhaps that world influenced the choice of the way to do it. The one common denominator that most people come to is that this murder was a message to opponents of the Kim regime that you're never safe no matter where you're, that they can get you at any time. This murder is so brazen and so terrifying, done in a public space, all over camera, by people who might not even be assassins and in a way that would grab the headlines in a sensational way. It's a warning to all of 'North Korea's' enemies. Even though there are so many factors that implicate 'North Korea' and specifically Kim Jong-un, we can't say for sure. Assuming he's responsible, he had so many ways and opportunities to kill Kim Jong-nam and yet he chose to do it this way.written by Gregory Mann",False
4,9,Watch this doc!,Brad_G35,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs soon as I saw the trailer for this, I knew it was a must-watch.I remember when this happened but didn't really focus on any of the details. North Korea is always portrayed in western media... well you know. ""Crazy leader. Crazy North Korean. Shooting missiles off. Something Something."" We never get many details in the way this doc presents them.(SMALL SPOILER PARAGRAPH): Enter this film. I just finished it and I'm blown away. I mean... where do I start. From the Kim regime. From a prank show... if you've watched any type of Asian media, you know how silly these prank shows can be at times. From a team of North Koreans setting this up. To multiple actual pranks with these girls over a time frame. To the unsuspecting girls. To the trial an aftermath. I'm just not sure what to make of it all. Even the geopolitical nature alluded to on why Siti was released first and Doan was kept longer because of the NK/Viet Communist ties. There's so much to digest here.This is a well constructed documentary. If you don't know much about the story, you'll be on the edge of your seat and not bored at all. Kudos to the filmmaker there.As for these girls and their story. I think I believe them. There's just too many obvious things. From all the CCTV footage to all the texts with none indicating what was going to happen. Not changing their look. Going back to the scene of the crime two days later.I understand their naivety in some ways but the other angle that I don't understand is with the poison. They had it on their hands! The doc goes into why they wouldn't be bothered by it being on their hands but it seems totally bizarre to me that two people had it on their hands and they were careful enough with it to not kill themselves in the process. As I said before, I think I believe them. But you're telling me they didn't think something was a bit off during this whole thing? To me it seems like MOST*(Keyword: MOST) of their story adds up but there are one or two pieces that just don't make sense.Regarding the North Koreans in this situation... if this particular team is capable of manipulating these two girls; I need to know what else they've done. It's interesting any way you look at it. With manipulation like this, it can't be their first rodeo.Side note: In the team, James. The doc mentioned that they have no idea what happened to him. That's another interesting bit. Sure... all governments have these operatives spread out around the world but the spectacle surrounding this is just so crazy.Watch this doc!",True
5,10,Must watch,pauliewalnuts-49356,n/a,16/08/2025,I've just finished this fantastic documentary and was totally enthralled...in fact I'm so impressed I'm keeping this review short because I want you to go see it...brilliant!,False

7,7,Prank Gone Too Far,potatochip00,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAssassins 2020 is a documentary of the killing of North Korea leader's older half brother.Evidence provided in the documentary are not evidence of pranks but evidence of assaults. These are more like 'haha gotcha' moments.I believe the assailant didn't know what she was doing. That at least was obvious. But they had suspicions. Anybody with a brain can see that everything was very suspicious. From not using their names to not wanting to be on camera, and not informing the people that they were pranks... Also, not receiving their consent to use the footage, How old the men wereNot acting on those suspicions is something they are clearly guilty of.""Nobody else agreed to do it""... Whom I wonder Y?The document purposely tries to manipulate the viewer to have negative assumptions on NK instead of presenting the facts without bias. The facts should speak for themselves.So should they be punished for their crimes? I think they've been punished enough.All things considered. This is nothing new. America and other countries had a handful of political assassinations done in the past years. There were some scapegoats too.",True
8,9,Fantastic! Stranger than fiction,mlivziey,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the best true crime doc I have seen in a long time. While the genre is crowded and many many of the ""shocking"" documentaries are sensationalized, this one truly is bizarre. Kept me engaged the entire time.A true spy story that is stranger than fiction. Gives a good overview of tensions in North Korea and among the ruling dynasty. Even for those unfamiliar with the subject, this will grab ahold of you and not let go for the duration.There are some answers left unanswered and justice has not been served, but it paints a clear picture of what happened and why. Really excellent!",False
9,9,Gripping documentary that plays like a spy thriller.,fredtt-64099,n/a,16/08/2025,"The subject of this documentary is definitely one of those cases of truth being stranger than fiction. I won't go into the details of the story, as this is a film you should approach knowing as little as possible about in order to maximise the surprise and tension generated by its twisting and turning narrative, but broadly it concerns the assassination of a North Korean exile and the subsequent trial of those accused of his murder. The documentary is very well constructed, with the information on the various individuals involved being slowly drip fed, flash back style, over the events of the trial itself. It has the pacing and structure of a classic 70s spy thriller - although this plot is so outlandish it would be deemed preposterous if it weren't actual true. The access to the various participants is excellent & the makers have gathered a wealth of video from CCTV, news & social media to supplement their own footage, so as a viewer it never feels like you are being short changed. It is all very one sided; its clear where the filmmaker's sympathies lie, but then again the North Koreans were never going to participate in a film like this. All in all this documentary is every bit as enjoyable as a regular drama / thriller & keeps you on the edge of your seat right until the end - I would highly recommend it.",False
10,10,A master class in what a documentary should be,mark-52147,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched this program, excellent production with no sensationalism or repetition (a common fault is programs will go to the commercials break then on return will repeat the story from before the break) telling the story in it's entirety without prejudice to any side (you even understand the Malaysian authorities position and actions) and presents the possible motives for why this event took place.",False

He is nothing but a baby-man inept to be a good leader out of love, a cry-baby that kills anyone that doesn't comply with his stupid and childish requests, unfit to be: a man, a good honest person, and adult, a thinker, loving responsible, a leader. His only path have been the suffering of the North Korean people, and everyone that deals with North Korea; I hope the North Korean people rises and kill the Fascism in that Country and embrace true democracy: public employees elected and fired by The People",False

15,9,Great Documentary!!,afredlee,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary chronicle the case of Kim Jong Nam murder. It focus on the fate of the two women charged with the murder, presenting the defenses for both women from their legal representatives.These women are foreigners in Malaysia, who took part in action that resulted in death of a prominent North Korean figure. They were arrested and held at Malaysian prison for almost 2 years while their case is being trial, if found guilty is punishable with death sentence by hanging.This documentary is not too heavy and complicate, I find it very easy to digest. I would've like if it to cover more about Kim Jong Nam, but it does the job well to tell the stories of these women.A very emotional journey and surprising twist in the end. It shows a realistic look into the justice system in Malaysia, how it is easily manipulated by its government.

One of many, probably in the tens-of-thousands killed by the totalitarian Jong-un (joins Russia's Putin, and China's Xi Jinping) as being proficient at maintaining control using that, and other methods. A selfish, in part economic, policy rationale by D. Trump has encouraged these genocides. Trump: ""I just received a beautiful letter from Kim Jong-un ... very warm, very nice letter.

Hearing the producer answer questions at the Q&A reinforced what interesting and difficult experiences it took to bring this film to the screen.

21,n/a,Lots of errors of fact in this doc,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirstly the two women have been released. One outright, one after serving a few more months.
Fact is that Malaysia judicial system is somewhat of an outlier in severity of sentences, it is not really an outlier on judicial process.You have to take into account that a reasonable person, even if not knowing they are participating in a cloak and dagger international assignation, knows that this could be an assault, or even an aggravated assault they are participating in.
They may not have outright known that they were applying a fatal doe of VX nerve agent. but given the prevalence of acid attacks etc, the women can not have excluded they were participating in something harmful but smearing something in some strangers eyes at the direction of another stranger -- and for pay.Somehow the KNEW not to get the agent they were sticking in the guy's eyes on their own hands.

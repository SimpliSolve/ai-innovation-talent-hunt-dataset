1,8,A fantastic peek into metro crime and it's men and women,matrixdukenukem,n/a,16/08/2025,"-1 stars on Netflix for not promoting this amazing piece of work. The cinematography, editing, background score and direction is as good as documentaries made in Hollywood. The stories are ofcourse hand picked and there are obvious biases visible throughout. However, whatever was convered, was done brilliantly.This is not any game changing, eye opening documentary. At best this might be an attempt to humanize men and women of police force who we (indians) are mostly scared of and keep a distance. That being said, it achieves that objective nicely.There are some disturbing scenes, narration, police brutality (sugar coated) and a heart breaking case on last episode and so it might not be for everyone. It hit me hard because it was so close to home.The two negatives I can say are, the police are self aware of the camera and crew present in all scenes. Their behaviour is toned down except for couple of officers who probably didn't care. At first I thought they were bad actors hired to recreate crime scenes like in crime patrol episode. And another negative is lack of any kind of promotion from Netflix.I am glad I saw this and I appreciate all the men and women of our police force who honestly want to do good for the citizens and care about justice. You should watch it too.",False
2,8,Something new then the standard crime docu,fajarsantoso,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love crime documentaries and I really enjoyed this documentary. Not because it' about crime, but it allows the viewer to see how things work in India and THAT was really interesting too see. This documentary pushes you to see things with an open mind, from a different perspective and accept that certain things don't go the way we are used to it in a developed democratic country which we all take for granted nowadays. This documentary is eye-opening and I wish they would make more of this documentaries in other, underdeveloped countries.",False
3,8,A fascinating watch.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Four episodes, four crimes, one great series, we've all seen countless cop shows from The US, and for me UK based ones also, so it was fascinating to see how things are done in India.It's a very gritty, incredibly well made series, with the focus very much on the crimes, and those involved, you will see very many cultural differences, but one thing that's very clear, these cops stop at nothing to get to the truth, and that they do.The Detectives demand respect, and they get it, there is no messing around, they're direct, and straight to the point, although some of the tactics may be a little surprising.It's very nicely produced, and very well made, at no point did I feel as though they had overdone things.I loved the first three episodes, I didn't care for the fourth quite so much, I only hope we get to see more. 8/10.",False
4,8,Pretty good.,lokesh-acm,n/a,16/08/2025,"It definitely could have been done better. But overall, this is a good watch. Each episode is independent and reveals how humans kill for very little. Sad.Along with the crime and the investigation, they show the officers and try get a peak into their lives. This feels forced upon the viewers and i did not like this part.",False
5,6,It's like a bad car crash and I can't look away,elizrug,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm fascinated by the stories while at the same time appalled by the backwardness of some of the officers--blaming sex workers and saying they're disgusting, saying a female murder suspect is attractive if she wears makeup then blaming her boyfriend as if she just couldn't have it in her to murder someone, threatening to beat up anyone they bring into the station whether they have any real suspicion of them being the culprit--and I'm only into episode three!So while the crimes are motives and scenery are fascinating to me, the behavior of the police is abhorrent and it makes total sense when Indians say they are terrified of the police. They are some truly backwards people. I honestly hope not all of them are like this for the sake of the country.",True
6,10,Fascinating Series!,JPCCastingKat,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great show depicting how crime happens gets reported, investigated, and ultimately solved in various police provinces throughout India!I hate that there's only 4 episodes! ðŸ˜ª",False
7,6,Raw and fresh but...,ashishpsy,n/a,16/08/2025,Documentary series is good but...they play both original audio and dubbed hindi audio simultaneously.... Whole things become like a noise.Otherwise good series.,False
8,10,NEED MORE EPISODES,robinji1,n/a,16/08/2025,Need MORE!! 4 episodes is such a tease. Any chance to see other cities as well?,False
9,7,"Simple, True & Undramatic",OnjiMooteDaMarle,n/a,16/08/2025,"At last a Kannada Documentary series!There are 4 episodes and every episode is different from the other. We do see glimpses of the police's personal lives too. Every case is different from each other and is only rooted to Bangalore.The episodes aren't great or surprising or thrilling and is made in a very simple straight forward way. The scenery of Bangalore is something that is not shown in movies. Kannada directors go outside Karnataka to shoot while Bollywood directors' version of South India is Chennai, Hyderabad and Kerala. Shame.As for being real is concerned, I did find many words were put into the police or victim's mouths. The subtitles weren't accurate. I doubt the makers are even Indians which wouldn't have been a problem but after watching BBC's Nirbhaya documentary, I am sure that foreigners making Indian films/ documentaries is only to demean India and nothing else.",False
10,5,The series only exposes poor crime investigation in India,vasudhaivakutumbhakam,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sadly and ironically, rather than being a good crime investigation, the series exposes the horrible approach followed by the agencies mainly the Police in crime investigations in metro cities. Imagine the situation in villages.People are picked up and rounded up at the police station without any substantial suspicion/proof and legal warrant even at the night and thrashed and forcefully made to admit the crime. Sad state of Human rights affair.Most of the Police personnels have the sickening mentality of treating people like animals. The junior the personnel the more bad-mouthed he or she is. I hope the police academy thinks of teaching public speaking skills to these closed-minded goons. One can observe the sheer narrow mindedness and laughable opinions of these policemen in the series itself. Sadly, it is a reality in India. Very Long way to go for the police personnels before thay start behaving like human beings.The police boasts as if they have brought about heaven and hell to solve a case. It's just cctv recording in the name of investigations. A woman officer has sickening opinions towards sexworkers. Another police officer tells innocent people who are detained for no reason that they should be thankful to him that they are free now.No matter if a person is victim, minor, suspect, no data privacy is followed in the episodes. Very sad and worrisome. This series Just angers me more. Couldn't take it more after 2 episodes.",False
11,10,"The best of Netflix... Crime, Reality TV, India!",ska-54519,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you love watching crime and are also interested in learning about different cultures, this is the show for you. Each episode starts off with a call to the Police about the crime (usually murder, but there is also one kidnapping). You then follow the Police to the crime scene, through the investigation, to catching the accused. This show is just very authentic, something that you can't script. The golden nuggets of conversation are the highlights for me in seeing how things work in such a non-PC manner. E.g. Police commenting that the female accused isn't bad-looking and would look ok if she were to put makeup on; the Police saying they won't tell the witness boy his mother has died as otherwise he will go straight into depression and not help them in the investigation; the relatives (of the accused who killed her mother) telling the accused 'burn in hell' and saying to the police 'why are you helping her? Just put her under a train?'; the police telling the accused 'we have been talking to you nicely but I can make these cameras go away, you understand what I'm saying?' It is just fascinating! These cops are here to get the job done and it's a treat to watch - thank you Netflix!Just to add, I turned on the original Kannada audio on with English subtitles, as I think you get a better feel hearing the people speak as if you were there, than hearing the English or Hindi dubbing.",True
12,6,CCTV stories it should be....,sndpkumar,n/a,16/08/2025,Its nothing solving a crime . Its just finding the cctv footage. Too boring . Crime patrol is way better than this i feel.Couldn't watch more than 2 episodes.,False
13,1,Very bad policing.,ajaygreenthumb,n/a,16/08/2025,India's cops are a joke. No crime scene investigator's in sight. No wonder so many cases go unsolved.,False
14,10,Thrilling.,adityachhetri,n/a,16/08/2025,"The format is amazing. The investigations being filmed as they happen, gives it a surreal feeling. Totally different from all the other shows, that feature re-enactments of the real thing.Hope Netflix, makes more content like this. Content like this is worth paying for.",False
15,7,Let it Pass!,yashy1109,n/a,16/08/2025,The series added a sence of realism to the whole police and crime solving thing. The editing and camera work is great nothing other than that is appreciable.Not at all a recommendation worthy!,False
16,8,"Good show, might make one uncomfortable",asenlawati,n/a,16/08/2025,"Frankly surprised by the production value of the series, overall it was good but it raises a lot of questions into how the police work which might not always take into account human rights.It's not a show for the faint of heart, I did not expect them to showcase the actual dead bodies on the show it made me feel uncomfortable. Also the way they treat suspects is not the best and the police justifying their brutality is something I didn't feel comfortable with as well.",False
17,7,Cellophane on the sofa,sukitata,n/a,16/08/2025,"Would recommend was a good watch interspersed with some jaw dropping comments from the main characters coming over as biased and misogynistic which doesn't surprise but is a window into issues of violence against women up and down the country - if this is the attitude of the Police there seems to be little hope of being treated fairly or getting justice for many womenCredit where it's due though, they did get the culprits although can't help but wonder what form investigations would take if CCTV wasn't available.BTW was great to see the cellophane still on the sofas in the station, this brought back many happy memories of a time long gone.",False
18,10,Great series and need more series from Bengaluru police service,joshisuhas-91120,n/a,16/08/2025,One of the best series I have watched. True and genuine. Patience listening and supporting to the family is overwhelming. I support Bengaluru police they are always supporting and caring.,False
19,1,Crime and investigation...,mpmtcjvf,n/a,16/08/2025,Crime and the investigation is ok but way they are treating suspects that too during investigation is some to check.,False
20,9,Good one.,rufusmonteiro,n/a,16/08/2025,I just finished the first episode and it was really good. The cinematography is amazing.,False
21,6,NETFLIX HAVE CREATED GREAT DOCUMENTARY,selenaafzal,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe police in INDIA are not as good as the documentary makes out. Beat a confession out of people unless there is evidence to the contrary. They have access to phone records and live location updates. Not sure what legislation they use to obtain these. However it's a good use of Technology.I do not like how they beat people and how they speak to members of the community like they are inferior.The same theme follows across all episodes.I do like how they are determined to solve the murder case but it would be interesting to know how many murders they actually solve.They give it a lot of hype about how great they are.In the episode with the murdered set worker they beat her ex lover because they believed he was lying. Turns out they were wrong. You can't hurt innocent people like that.It's against humanity and justice.,True
22,5,India -_-,Joomie0208,n/a,16/08/2025,So the policewoman hates sex workers and cannot touch them but wouldn't blame the men paying the sex workers. The trousers define if you're a student or not. No wonder this country is doomed.,False
23,10,A must watch definitely!,UmeshAditya,n/a,16/08/2025,A must watch series based on Bangalore's recent crimes. Extremely well directed cinematography which shows clear modus operandi of policemen. Plus point is it provides testimonials of the accused and culprits.Unfortunately only 4 episodes though!,False
24,10,Awesome show,ashwin-72949,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing ! Kudos to Shashi Sir and Anuchet Sir ! And a big shout out to all the cops in Bangalore City for their dedication to keep the city safe,",False
25,10,Well deserved,rkrishnamurthy-59748,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ya it's well deserved for 10. Making is good, it also shows that how police officers are struggling day and night for justice... In the end the justice will always prevail...",False

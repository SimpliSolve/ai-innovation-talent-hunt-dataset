1,5,Okay But Misguided.,ginoconte28-227-9682,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerStarts off well, with a decent amount of storytelling and interviews some good people.That part has all been done before in many places, perhaps this is what led the filmmaker to take a turn in the later parts of this film.It feels like a failed attempt at a hatchet job on Nike & Jordan.The blame for these senseless and violent acts lie with humans and their nature, not a brand of shoe.At a point it's time to look internally rather than blame ""the man""",True
2,7,Great insight in to the development of the air jordans,Jimmyriddled,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have an interest in trainers and football boots. I really enjoyed the documentary it was well shot and informative. I don't quite understand why the end of the documentary decided to focus on how people have been getting killed for the their air jordans. The documentary ended on such a sour note, almost as if it was Nike and Jordan's fault that this was happening. I agree it could have been touched Upon within the documentary but it was way over the top to end like that. Still worth a watch.",True
3,7,Very satisfying...,kareembynes,n/a,16/08/2025,....this has been a great insight. Never before seen archival footage makes this a must watch documentary of a monumental product.,False
4,7,One mans Billions and his shoes to kill for,allanmichael30,n/a,16/08/2025,"It gives a great insight in to what was a golden age for basketball shoes and the Air Jordan-tm. Does Michael Jordan (M.J) have responsibility for deaths of children and adults, that happen because of the way his name was used in Marketing shoes. The area's that sell his shoes are some of the most deprived area's of USA and having these shoes is a status symbol. It seems that M.J did care and talk to families that lost there love ones.
At what point did M.J dictate marketing in way where they were sold and could he have stopped it?",False

6,10,A balanced and detailed depiction of the impact of the Air Jordan Culture - must see!,TobySwarensen,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film takes you on a journey. It explores the marketing genius behind the rise of the multi-billion dollar business. The archival footage is spectacular and has been cleverly edited together so you feel like you've been transported back into the 80's and 90's. It's a celebration of this iconic product and its impact on popular culture, however it also shines a light on the dark side. Something that's rarely discussed but should be. It's a great watch! I've already recommended it to several friends and posted it online.",False
7,10,loved this!,dreamer-98789,n/a,16/08/2025,Some great footage and interview I ended up learning allot would recommend watching!,False
8,10,Incredibly interesting reveal of the Jordan brand,piersg,n/a,16/08/2025,"This piece was brilliant, I learnt so much from it. Having an interest in both basketball and trainer culture, I was interested to see the journey of the brand and the marketing decisions that made it so hugely successful. Until I saw this I had no idea the journey of the brand was so complex. The archive was put together wonderfully and subject matter was delivered in the perfect tone of voice to do justice to the enormity of the cultural phenomenon of Jordan.",False
9,10,well worth a watch,eddiethornewas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not sure what ksaifert-18007 was watching. Jordan is flavour of the month along with general reflection. This film serviced both, it was a great summary of a moment in time socially and economically, not just in the US but the west in general",False
10,10,Absolutely loved this and some important lessons leant,katiaehall,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film. It delicately explores the incredible back story of the PR machine behind the power of the Air Jordan brand and the inner workings behind its success, both good and bad. The archive has been collected and compiled beautifully and really give a seamless insight into the journey of the huge cultural impact and legacy this collaboration had. Great soundtrack makes it even more of a joy to watch.",False
11,9,Fantastic look at brand marketing and corporate accountability,michaelmarden,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fascinating look at the origin story of brand Air Jordan and the marketing and PR machine that built it into the company it is today.Great contributors - including legends like Peter Moore, Sonny Vaccaro, David Falk, David Stern. A brilliant companion piece to The Last Dance if you're interested in the legacy of Jordan beyond the court and the NBA.And explores some timely and important issues around corporate accountability and the crimes that have plagued these sneakers and the way they have been marketed and released since the late 80's.Fantastic soundtrack, rare and engaging archive footage. Highly recommended.
9/10",False
12,10,Let's ask the audience.,barnesshai,n/a,16/08/2025,"Claiming a shift of blame is an interesting take if not short sighted... when in actuality the film assesses the lasting legacy and the impact of Nike on the Black community.The interviews presented leave room for the audience to decide who they find at fault in this tale of warning. Wonderfully shot and edited this documentary covers the Air Jordan history with a caution and insight. Complex questions are asked throughout this documentary, questions that linger for a while post watch.",False
13,8,A real eye-opener into such a lucrative business deal.,joshbarton15,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary from Yemi Bamiro gives an insight into the impact the Air Jordan brand had on the world, from marketing strategies designed to make them desirable to the cultural significance they possessed with Michael Jordan being such a major star of the NBA. To this day they still make billions of dollars a year but it was the switch of tone in the documentary to show the dark side of consumerism that made this such a facinating viewing experience. There have been many cases of people being either seriously injured or killed for a pair of these shoes as they come with such a hefty price tag and are so sought after, a graphic informing us that there have been killings every year since the sneakers first launched in 1989. It's an eye-opener for sure and I feel would make a great companion piece to The Last Dance.",False
14,10,Complex and satisfying.,LoreliBlake,n/a,16/08/2025,What begins as almost a tribute to the marketing power of Nike and Michael Jordan swiftly turns to implications of such marketing on Black lives.Are black lives worth $180?A must watch.,False

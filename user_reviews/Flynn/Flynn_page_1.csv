1,10,"The 1 star reviews have nothing to do with the movie, it's pure politics",baltejparhar,n/a,16/08/2025,"All the 1 star reviews just tells you this movie exposes too much truth. And people who have fallen for government (Democrat) propaganda can't handle their lies being exposed.The truth is, the US government and intelligence community is a criminal organization and they want there to be perpetual wars so they can profit off of it. Any reasons they give for the wars are fake. General Flynn and Trump are true patriots that actually wanted to put an end to the military industrial complex, but they've been sabotaged from within at every turn. All the criminal charges and media perceptions of these 2 men are because the intel community wants to maintain their power and source of money.",False
2,10,An important movie everyone should see,forshman,n/a,16/08/2025,"General Mike Flynn is a true American patriot and the story about what he went through, the political persecution, gives great insight into what can actually happen to leadership in our country today. Not even honorably serving your country can protect you. Highly recommend watching this movie with an open mind.One of the other reviews of this movie here is a disingenuous take by someone attacking General Mike Flynn and not actually talking about the movies. The review titled: ""A documentary that praises treason"" is written by a radical on the left that didn't even watch the movie. That's the type of person that General Mike Flynn was up against, unhinged radicals, communists, on the left that have nothing but hatred in their hearts.",False
3,8,How The Corrupt Vilify A Hero.,izrac,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie shows haw corrupt both Political Parties in the US are. Anybody who is politically aware, knows that the Russian Collusion, in the Trump, administration was One Big Lie. The ones who were accusing Trump, and General Flynn, of collusion with the Russians are the ones who fabricated all of the Lies and have proven that they are guilty, and all the concrete evidence against them, is out there. After the 2020 election, Pence, showed his true colors and now is one of the most hated politicians in his party. General Flynn was going to expose the corruption and stop some of the pork spending, and the corrupt politicians on both sides of the aisle did not want to be implicated, so they went after General Flynn. They were also trying to go after General Flynn, by implicating that his son who he was in business with, committed a crime. The pathetic, corrupt politicians, do not care how many innocent lives that they destroy to accomplish their goal. They have also done the same to Alex Jones. This movie tells what General Flynn, had to go through to prove his innocence and show the corruption in the government, which is being exposed more everyday.",False
4,1,Flynn Flunk,darren-02137,n/a,16/08/2025,"Flynn disappoints on multiple fronts, failing to deliver a balanced or engaging narrative. The film is marred by a one-sided portrayal that seeks to glorify Flynn and cast him in a heroic light, often at the expense of nuance and factual accuracy. It indulges in excessive self-aggrandizement, presenting Flynn as an ultimately infallible figure, a narrative choice that feels more like a public relations exercise than a genuine attempt at storytelling.The script is laden with clich√©s and lacks the depth needed to explore the complexities of Flynn's career and controversies. The direction is uninspired, with scenes that seem designed more to bolster Flynn's image than to provide an objective account of his actions and decisions. The portrayal of key events in Flynn's career is overly simplistic, glossing over critical details and controversies that are essential to understanding the full picture.Moreover, the film's pacing is erratic, with slow, tedious stretches that fail to build any real tension or engagement. The characters, including Flynn himself, are depicted in a flat, unconvincing manner, making it difficult for viewers to invest in their stories. The lack of critical examination or balanced viewpoints leaves the film feeling shallow and unfulfilling.In the end, Flynn falls short of being a compelling biopic or a credible historical account. It comes across as an overt attempt to rehabilitate Flynn's image rather than a genuine exploration of his life and career. This approach not only undermines the film's credibility but also alienates viewers seeking an insightful and balanced perspective. Overall, it is a missed opportunity to engage with a controversial figure's complex legacy in a meaningful way.",False
5,10,A film not to be missed no matter what your politics,wes_434,n/a,16/08/2025,"An amazing authentic heartfelt documentary about a real American patriot who loved his family and served his country with honor and distinction, despite how the Washington swamp tried to do all it could to destroy him and what he loved the most because he got in their way. This is an in-depth look at what really happened to General Flynn and by extension, the country.The film not only moved me to tears, it left me feeling encouraged that good people who fight for the soul of America and suffer grave injustice for their service can still prevail.The documentary is not only intriguing, feeling like a political thriller throughout, but at many points it's raw with emotion. It's hard to imagine any honest person watching this would not be moved to want to cheer at the end for the underdog.The message I got from the movie was about how faith is tested and how heroes and leaders are forged. It's a reminder that what it means to be an American is not the U. S. Government. It's in the hearts of people like the Flynn's and all the those who sacrificed and dared to do the right thing, even when the most powerful forces were against them.",False
6,1,Worst documentary ever.,jasonchubb,n/a,16/08/2025,"First I want to say I am a Flynn fan. I am a Trump fan. I also feel I understand 85 percent of this story. Through the use of chatgpt and reading as much as I could online, I feel I have a fairly good understanding. So, I was looking for this documentary to iron out those things that still I don't understand, but that was not, I guess, what this documentary was about. 75 to 80 percent of this documentary is a profile into the personal life of Mike Flynn. And 20 to 25 percent is about the facts of the case. The first 45 minutes are completely useless.Of course the music playing throughout the whole movie was so irritating you could cut it with a fork.And when I look on here to find out who wrote and directed, I can't find it.",False
7,2,Alt Right Redemption,brelanda,n/a,16/08/2025,"While some of the information about Ex-General Flynn is factual well documented, it is all placed in a manner to put the best light on the life and times of ""Patriot General Flynn"".All people who are interviewed and used to extol the virtues and patriotism are either Family or Right wing fanatics (Tucker Calison).Every time something bad happens it is always some body else's fault. While disclaiming the contact between the Trump campaign the Russian's the Muller report stated at least 17 Trump associates had contacts with Russians or Wikileaks and had at least 100 face to face interactions, phone calls or electronic messages with Russians or Kremlin-linked figures and at least 51 people.This ""Documentary"" ends without a mention of the fact that on May 30, 2020 Flynn said Trump should impose martial law to overturn the results of the 2020 election. It seems this was not important to the narrative in his ""Life Of Service"" to democracy.",False
8,8,Eye opener as if you didn't already know,Silicone54,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a news junkie I kinda knew a lot about the Flynn case. This doc sheds a bright light onto the matter mainly from Flynn's perspective. During the trial we only heard what the news media put out, the same new media that conspired with the mushrooms in DC to bury an American veteran and hero.I wish they could have gotten at least 1 member of the ""government"" to explain why they thought they had a case against Flynn. These mushrooms frequently show up as experts on news outlets so they have a lot to say. Lie to the public once more about Flynn for old time's sake.That's the reason for the 8 star its missing the other side of the debate. This feels like a puff piece for Flynn which he's entitled to for sure. But rating the doc only its not a complete winner for me.",False
9,1,Conspiracies and Nonsense,alexmac-11070,n/a,16/08/2025,"The, as you would expect from propaganda, fails to accurately describe the events that have occurred, further more as a documentary it fails to provide a full portrait of its subject, because I am not exaggerating what I tell you that this guy is bats**t crazy in real life. A legit psycho. Flat earther level of conspiratorial. The ten stars reviews are clearly based on politics: people have already been indoctrinated by the lies people like Flynn have told. It's too late to save those people, but do yourself a favor and steer way clear of this film. You will be much better off if you do so. Again, he's an absolute nutjob.",False
10,9,A must see for all Americans who care for their country!,rasmatas-signup,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this movie with a great amount of interest as I knew about what the intelligence community and ""law enforcement"" was trying to do to this man before his ascension to National Security Advisor.I had the pleasure to serve closely with Mike Flynn both in and out of combat. He is one of the most honorable, brave, great Americans with whom I ever served. This movie explains quite well why the intelligence community turned against him early in his ascension to General Officer rank in the military. He went against the party line and criticized the system propped up by lifelong bureaucrats and powerful lobbyists involved in the ""military industrial"" dance.This documentary gives a great overview of how the US government turned to third-world political warfare to take out political opponents through trickery, confusing the public, feeding the media party lines, and outright character assassination with no mind for the aftermath. A depressing story with an uplifting ending that is the Flynn family.In my opinion, this documentary was too gentle in countering the vicious, vindictive government senior bureaucrats - many of whom are still dishonorably serving this country - as well as members of the Obama Administration and carryovers into the Trump administration. The documentary's lack of deserved criticism for these lifelong bureaucrats would be regarded as ""fair treatment"" by today's news organizations... in direct contradiction to the confused and baseless attacks they levied against Mike Flynn and his family on a near-daily basis.Let us never forget Chuckie Schumer's warning on one of the government's propaganda channels to President Trump in January 2017.... ""Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,"" And this is exactly what happened to General Flynn.Let's not forget how John Brennan - one of the main characters of this saga - bragged (and probably still does) about how he joined the CIA when he was a registered member of America's Communist party (his words, not mine) making him a perfect fit for the Obama Administration and the America to come.And the producer left out casts of others in the intelligence community, federal law enforcement and other sections of the U. S government that were directly complicit in making sure Michael Flynn fell and fell hard.There are so many stories still to tell. This could have easily been a mini-series with 12 more two-hour long episodes to introduce the audience to the entire cast of miscreants involved in this sordid affair. A great place to start would be the 51 ""intelligence professionals"" - many of whose names were not made public because they were still actively ""serving"" - that signed the 2020 pre-election memo swearing that Hunter Biden's laptop was ""Russian disinformation"". Many of them - if not all - were involved in the Flynn affair. And Michael Vickers - the former USDI - is at the top of that list. Vickers has a knack for shirking all disasters and controversies under his watch and coming out completely unscathed.The Cabal in DC have perfected the tactic of ""suiciding"" your political opponent.... making it appear to the public that their opponent had no other option but to disappear from the earth from their dastardly deeds. While they come close to this goal with members of General Flynn's family, they discounted the Flynns' strength of their commitment to and love for each other. Nonetheless, the US Government backed by your taxpaying dollars did everything they could to bankrupt and destroy this honorable and typical American family, while many of these tax-sucking officials went home to their undeserved riches in DC's finest suburbs and laid their heads down to sleep without a care. Despicable!The cover ups continue and many of the self-serving bureaucrats are still entrenched in the system today.This documentary has a powerful lesson: General Flynn never gave up on this country and neither should we. If the Cabal could do this to him and his family, they can do it to you. Let's get to work!",False
11,10,Brings a lot of context to the Trump years-Amazing!,hoganweld,n/a,16/08/2025,"Simply amazing. We'll worth the watch - you will get a lot of context to the other side of the Trump years. Every person who has formed an opinion about Trump and his Allies based on media narrative should take a look at this film. Wether one agrees with it or not is irrelevant, it tells the other side of the story and that is something we have been lacking in the US.Flynn truly seems to be an outstanding person and deserves an apology from everyone who has played a role in attempting to ruin the Flynn families lives. It needs to be a very loud and very public apology so that every corner of the US knows that Flynn has been vindicated.",False
12,10,An important American story,tyler-nagle,n/a,16/08/2025,"General Michael Flynn's movie is a compelling expos√©, unveiling the ruthless destruction of an American patriot. Irrespective of political affiliations, this narrative demands attention and reflection. Flynn, a distinguished national security figure, weathered unprecedented adversity, deeply impacting not just him but his entire family.The film serves as a stark reminder of the pervasive corruption within Washington, urging viewers to confront uncomfortable truths. It's an essential watch for those committed to upholding integrity and accountability in today's turbulent political climate.10/10.",False
13,10,FLYNN is a MUST SEE for all Americans,schweetp-47763,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a mom of three current army officers. In 2017, I watched in absolute horror the despicable unfounded, illegal and unconstitutional proceedings against Gen Flynn for political reasons. It was a disgusting shame that our federal agencies allowed themselves to be weaponized politically in this manner in an attempt to destroy Gen. Flynn's impeccable military service record.Because there is so much important information covered, I personally viewed it at least four times. I've highly recommended it to every American on social media and made sure that my own community of several hundred fam, friends, associates and neighbors have seen it or will very soon. I pray for justice and for those responsible to be held accountable.Take our country back and make America great again. Watch this movie so you will understand our anti-American enemies, both foreign and domestic that we are up against. I have no doubt, we will win.",False
14,10,A must see for every American; Christian; veteran and Honest Politician,capoper,n/a,16/08/2025,"I purchased two of these documentaries - passing them around to everyone in the family. Pray for General Flynn, his family and those who travel with him. I hope they are successful in their endeavor to educate the American people to the corruption in this country and this world. The MSM (Main Street Media) are liars and have unfortunately successfully convinced the uneducated masses that we're living in a free country. Under the present administration that couldn't be further from the truth. The United States Congress (Senate and House) are made up of mostly just politicians worried about getting wealthy off the backs of hard working taxpayers. Only a handful of our current leaders are trying to make America Great Again. Share this story with all your friends and family.",False
15,10,Surreal,maxwellbrian-63999,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very rarely does reality exceed my expectations but the entire Flynn Movie experience was everything I hoped it would be and more , much more !!! God Bless Gen Flynn , his Family & the Flynn Movie Crew + the Volunteers , the best time I've had in a long time . I was surprised how at ease he was with everything he and his Family had to endure over the last 4 years he is a joy to be around and easy to approach. He was genuinely happy to meet each and every Patriot in attendance and answered every single question he was asked . The atmosphere was very peaceful and happy , the food was delicious and the Movie was entertaining and extremely informative. I highly recommend this Movie üçø",False
16,10,Americans Need to Know,kwbbpnz,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who has been following many of the real-life heroes who were shown or mentioned in this powerful documentary, I was impressed with the comprehensive way so much important data and so many events were pulled together in a way that makes it easy for the average American to understand. People like need who follow daily have amassed a great deal of info and explaining it to someone who knows things aren't right but doesn't know where to begin can be difficult. I now have this movie to gift them as a jumping off point and a frame of reference from which they can begin independent research if they need to know more.It's very well done and when compared to the narrative the colluders want you to believe, this documentary connects ALL of the dots whereas the narrative leaves gaping holes because they hide mores then they tell us. Every incident and every allegation is üíØ verifiable. It's important to know that the event within still works overtime to divide even those of us who are in the right side and one of the ways they've done so is to try to discredit General Flynn within the movement. Flynn sets far to and explodes those lies in this content and explains the ""controlled opposition"" and how they work to undermine those who are right over the target.Being over the target is why ""The Powers That Be"" went after him FIRST-knowing where the bodies are buried made him very dangerous to the Deep State-and the Deep State is explained thoroughly in this masterpiece I liked to call ""Intel for Dummies."" The American people are, for the first time in our history, being let it on game theory and learning the who, what, where, when and why of it all and learning the names of the people, places and things that are generally left out of the mainstream narrative in favor of salacious headlines and twisted accountings of what's really happening.This documentary is crucial to those of us who care about our country and had stopped believing in altruism and heroics as we watch everything being dismantled and destroyed. Flynn is a real and true American hero. He shows us what integrity, honor, sacrifice and humility look and sound like. It is so good to hear from his family and others close to him be able to validate the version of him I have come to believe in based on the past five years of my own research and discernment of who are the ""good guys"" and who are our ""enemies within.""If there's a message we are to glean beyond what I have mentioned already, it's that the people must stay engaged and involved in our own survival and while we can't all be heroes at this level, we all have access to heroes in this day and age and what we do (or don't do) to assist the best of us will be key to stopping the worst of us from succeeding in the destruction of America. We're being told and shown what we will become of us if we don't. We owe General Flynn a debt of gratitude and thanks, at the very least, and our time and loyalty every day.Watch it. Watch it with others.Gift it to others so they can watch and learn.Keep General Flynn, those working directly with him and their families in your prayers.",False
17,10,Extremely informative and terrifying what the government can do,chknpup,n/a,16/08/2025,The 1 star ratings are political. The documentary was very informative and answered questions our failed media never asked but should have. Terrifying what the government can do to its people. I'm looking forward to more and more of these documentaries surrounding all the shannanigans and crimes committed against other Americans over the past 50-60 years and escalating over the past 15 years. Thank goodness there are at least a few real journalists still alive and working. What a sad day when the president of the US has to pardon an innocent man just to stop future political persecution. Our forefathers are rolling over in their graves.,False
18,10,The CRUELTY to this man and his family is UNTHINKABLE,ohmyfacehurts,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are those of us who KNOW the ring of TRUTH when watching and listening to someone tell their story. This is a story of unfathomable cruelty by people who have a desperate agenda to cover their criminality & maintain their gargantuan cash flow, on the backs of our young people in he military. General Flynn DID NOTHING wrong and for him and his family to endure this vicious & unrelenting attack is proof that our beloved America is in very deep trouble. We need to weed out the criminals. There are A LOT of them- it's positively shocking but I have been learning about this for many years. It's so hard, as a Baby Boomer to accept the level of organized crime in our Fed but it's absolutely true.",False
19,10,Interesting and intriguing,kmpdsz,n/a,16/08/2025,"We heard about this movie and thought it might be a boring documentary, but it was very interesting. Informative Provides a lot of Previously unknown details, not generally shared on mainstream media. It's showcase shis life from childhood through his military career and the betrayal by his colleagues. There is more to the story than meets the eye. What I've seen on the news does it begin to cover it. The fact that the government could do this to one of their own shows you how truly corrupt they are, This is an eye-opening movie for sure it's caused me too rethink what I thought I knew about our system .",False
20,10,An Accurate Portrayal Behind the Scenes of Intelligence,johnrseay,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is an excellent portrayal of the inner workings of American Intelligence machine and its integration and manipulation by the political winds of the day. Filled with intrigue, this behind the scenes view of the military industrial complex highlights the financial driven motives behind most of the modern day wars and skirmishes. Interviews with key witnesses and journalists help shine a light on this little known American dirty secret. Sure, the political viewpoints are slanted to promote the views of the subject of this documentary, but after all, isn't that his prerogative? Watch it with an open mind and draw your own conclusions.",False
21,10,Please watch,jeffschreiber-83496,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm usually not one to write movie reviews but after watching Flynn, it feels like I have something to say. And this notion took hold after reading others comments especially the few trolls who dumped their trash here in
to order to lower the average rating. I grew up after World War 2 when just about everyone was proud to be an American. We all embraced our freedom while watching people in other places being forced to live under totalitarian regimes where power and corruption ran rampant. And I wondered how this could happen where low life, thugs like Hitler or Stalin or Mao could rule with an iron fist and a cold, heart.But this movie demonstrates in clear view that the same techniques and dirty business used by these enemies of the people can and do take place in America (and many other democracies) in the 21st Century. As the climax was reached in this real life horror story, I was reminded of Kafka's The Trial where a perfectly innocent man just going about his daily business is apprehended and attacked by the lawless legal system. What happened to General Flynn, and now to President Trump needs to be looked at as a warning - there are people in positions of influence and control who are not working for all of us. And when I say this, I mean all of us whether we are on the Right or Left, Middle or a political, we are targets of these monsters who have mastered the art of deception and distraction and are anything but public servants working for the betterment of or republic.So if you are interested in learning the truth about this very dark chapter in modern day America, this is a good place to look. The greatest threat to the sick agenda these liars have is to have an awakening of patriotic, honorable truth and freedom spreaders. Those like Flynn who walk the straight line with integrity and decency set a good example for us to follow. And when you compare this with the slimy, below the belt tactics used against us, it's a no brainer who we aspire to emulate. But you need to look and see it for yourself. You can't just let the media do your thinking for you. And you need to care.",False
22,10,Look at the Rating.,dsnover-59956,n/a,16/08/2025,Folks are cognizant of these patterns that occur within our country. What is more relevant is the continually obvious patterns this government maligns the good for the sake of its well meanining citizens. Flynn describes the ontologic trauma so many well meaning Americans endure. Especially at the onset of their service to a dark service few can prepare themselves for. It describes how well meaning service members are introduced believing they can be a force for good only to find they must have been mistaken. Because the status quo is so impermeable. It is fraught with folks especially chosen and retained to maintain the malignancy that is the rot of the justice department. Their fear is explicitly represented through out Flynn. A well organized documentary.,False
23,10,A portrait of a patriot and honorable man who was wronged by the Deep State,honorswar,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a retired veteran who served in the Intelligence Community myself for 30 years. So, I have seen how politics have colored intelligence assessments. General Michael Flynn tried to do the right thing and was rewarded by having his reputation and life destroyed by the Deep State within Washington who did not want a fearless speaker of truths in a position within President Trump's administration who would uncover all of the dirty secrets that the political Establishment wanted to remain hidden. So they sought to destroy him by any means necessary. It's about time that Michael Flynn had a chance once again to help restore the truth to Washington and power back to the American people.",False
24,8,Relevant to Today's Justice System,matthewfahl,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every voter should watch this movie to understand the lengths that the Deep State will go to protect themselves and ruin a good, honorable man. They can use the full power of the Justice System to falsely accuse and prosecute innocent people, even if they have to break laws and rules of the Court to do so.This movie describes, with a clear time-line and evidence, how General Flynn was framed and prosecuted for a crime he did not commit.I follow the news closely, but I was not aware of many of the details of this saga. It is truly a profile of an American hero and his willingness to fight what seemed to be insurmountable odds to prove his innocence and do what was right for this country.",False
25,10,Righteousness and anger is how the liars hide their lies,colonel-13070,n/a,16/08/2025,"Righteousness and anger is how the liars hide their lies. Now with the passage of time we see clearly that the left orchestrated many illegal initiatives against candidate, and then President Trump. The FBI is gone as we know it. They are political operative's used to a weapon against people who booked the left-wing administration. This is all been proven now. Flynn was a casualty of that as well. Comey was the absolute worst. It was so hard for law-enforcement to carry on knowing that the highest organization in the land was a massively, political, and corrupt. Never seen that in modern times to that scale. We all know Hillary has bodies stacked up in their history. I agree with Flynn when he related that he is surprised he was not killed. I was never that type of person to think this way but after the last 15 years or so, it has been the most incredibly disappointing version of left-wing government I've ever seen. They are forces at work that have a blood lust for power and they will burn the entire thing down in order to get it, hoping that they can stand on the ashes, while we all disintegrate . We are in bad shape. More is coming.",False

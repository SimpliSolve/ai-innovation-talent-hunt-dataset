1,7,"Great Story, Great Guy, Movie Could Be Better",MogwaiMovieReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"Michael Bisping is a hugely likeable character, a warrior of a fighter, and an inspiring figure in almost everything he's turned his hand to, so it was great to hear more of his backstory and fill in some of the blanks. But as a documentary, ""Bisping"" feels noticeably amateurish: there is little objectivity on display, and it almost seems like a vanity project or a promo reel - it's hard not to conclude that Bisping himself had a little too much say in what went in and what did not, and there are clearly a number of parts of the story that are intentionally glossed over and not going to be publicly told for some time.On top of that, the present-day re-enactments of some moments from the past come over quite cringey; there's way too many slow-motion shots of everyday moments for no reason, and the film keeps retreading the same ground too often (talking heads continually stating ""Bisping's a FIGHTER!"" and too many mentions of how he's ""doing it for his family""). Just cutting down on some of that flab would have shortened the film by a half hour, and it would have been a better one for it.It's still a great, one-in-a-million story, about a great guy, but if it had been made by someone who knew what they were doing it could also have been a great film. Definitely worth a watch, though, all the same.",False
2,9,"Love this guy, Bisping the machine",steigerdon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very well put together, enjoyed this very much. This guy was built to fight....period.",False
3,9,One of the best bio I've watched.,joseangelogayoso1024,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great ""updated"" story about of the the best ever fight inside the octagon. Imagine fighting with one eye and still become champion. Bisping really overcame his adversaries and focus in what he believed he will become. Really deserved a Hall of Fame form the UFC.",False
4,10,Absolute Must Watch,barrowdustin,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you like documentaries, it doesn't get any better than this. Not a person alive can watch this movie without laughing and crying. Bisping is a fascinating character and his story is unbelievable. Very well made.",False
5,10,Pride of the North,markt02000,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bisping - the warrior, the joker, the family man ! This is a must watch documentary. It gives a great background into this well known UFC fighter. From his humble rocky beginnings to middleweight champion.Some disliked his personality in the UFC but he did what he had to in order to get his title shot. Hard work 100% of the time. Slowly winning over his critics.Myself also coming originally from the North of England / a martial artist and being roughly the same age it was definitely amusing to see how Michael's 'adventures' in the 90's were and compared to my own.Hes always had that cheeky humor. Two of his outstanding lines - 1. When competing on the Ultimate Fighter in the interview - 'hey hey you better not be putting those subtitles on every time I speak'
And after his Anderson Silva fight the commentator asks him so where do you go from here Michael - 'well probably to hospital to get my face fixed'To have achieved the ultimate goal in the UFC and doing it the hard way is an inspiration. Not to mention the sacrifice and support he had from his wife.100% recommended. If you like him you will love this. If you dislike him then you may come out of this with new found admiration.",False
6,7,Slightly erratic doc about an absolute lad,elyobj,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't help but love Bisping. Some great interviews from other fighters and personalities, with some excellent footage and commentary on Bisping's journey to the top.",False
7,10,To be great is destined for a few.,bablumoklis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched this amazing documentary, absolutely unbelievable but everything is true about this man.
How you can taste defeat so many times, but never give up, and prevail a winner against the odds.
An inspiration to all in life, we fight for our dreams, the glory and the right to be called champion.
Gritty and real, an extraordinary man who fought in the most dangerous sport. At times a hooligan, and a foul mouthed lunatic. In the end he won the admiration and respect of friends and foe.
Highly recommended this unique biopic of the most successful British MMA exponent.",False
8,10,Wow,nobs-claude,n/a,16/08/2025,What a spectacular story.. what a good dude.Heart warming and so true down to earth real life.,False
9,10,Most Inspiring Film I've Ever Seen,zeuthuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bispings journey to the top is very special. After watching this I can't think of anyone more deserving of his place in the UFC Hall of Fame than Michael Bisping.Bisping is a real life rocky movie that will leave you feeling motivated to do anything.Vito Belfort took Bispings eye while juiced up on anabolic steroids. This should be the lesson to any fighter thinking of taking PEDs in MMA.The documentary begins in his hometown, his former home and close family. The sacrifices that his wife makes in the early days is incredible and a testament to their love.To win a martial arts title blind in one eye will unlikely ever be repeated by any fighter in history.You have to watch his story to understand the journey and the lessons you can take and apply them to your own life. Everytime I face doubt I will remember what Bisping has done and keep moving forward.",False
10,5,"Not bad, not great",ashton-altham,n/a,16/08/2025,"Never really followed Bispings career. The doco kind of drags a bit and talks about a lot of irrelevant things. I also don't understand why Michael Jai White and Vin Diesel were making commentary about ""being a man"" or ""being an alpha"" or being a ""fighter"". They're both actors. There were also scenes were Bisping reenacted things that he was telling the story of e.g. He was watching Rocky. We then see a 30 second clip of him in bed ""watching Rocky"" on his phone (holding it vertically by the way). I used to love UFC and the fighters around that period but this doco was hard to watch. Just poorly directed I think.",False
11,10,Brilliant and very entertaining. It's a rollercoaster !,nigelpaco,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great story told by the 'Count' himself. Michael starts off by telling us about his tough childhood, his introduction into MMA and each fight in the UFC that led him to eventually becoming middleweight champion of the world. Lots of fight footage plus interviews with ex fighters/staff etc..Bisping is a warrior, full of grit and determination, who will do anything for his family, a true Brit and a legend !I was lucky enough to attend both the Henderson and Silva fights at the Manchester arena and the o2 arena, watching this brought back all those memories.",False
12,10,Amazing from start to finish,the_sker10,n/a,16/08/2025,Everything you could wish for and more.Absolute must watch!10/10.,False
13,9,"Bisping, starring Bisping.",hongruss,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether you love or hate him, YOU cannot deny him. I thought this was a great look at the character that is Bisping.Funny, Irreverent, Rude, Challenging but a Winner. A Winner in life, in Profession and clearly in his Personal life.Somehow he has sacrificed himself, his personal relationships and his health BUT come out on top.Currently with a first rate UFC career, a great commentator career, not to mention his very successful acting and podcast career, all touched upon in this documentary.This film covers his early emotional life, his burgeoning career and his eventual growth to the heady heights of the Hall of Fame.All done with the love and support of a fantastic well rounded family, what more could a guy, or successful documentary want.I for one like Bisping, like his style but still find him brash and polarising. The doc. Shows this but he deserves everything he has EARNT.A real testament to you get out what you put in!A perfect, inspirational evenings viewing.",False
14,10,Awesome,wiseguy280,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't know much about Bisping other than he was a UFC champion at some stage. This film gives you an insight into what an amazing human he is. Glad I watched it, thoroughly enjoyed it and I now know what a true legend he really is. 10/10.",False
15,10,Inspiration!!!,benjaminmorgan-48027,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a young man, I couldn't stand Bisping. The older I got the more I could relate to him. Watching him mature in the octagon and hearing him call fights has been pretty awesome. This documentary was really eye opening!!! Understanding how far someone will go for what they love is pretty awesome and his story was great. Thank you Michael for an exciting career, super stoked you made this. Truly enjoyed your story!!! Great documentary, recommend to anyone who has self doubt!!",False
16,5,"Great content, poorly edited",petermchugh-81621,n/a,16/08/2025,"Michael Bisping is definitely an inspiring character, maybe not in all aspects, but definitely his motivation can give us all something to think about.The biggest problem with this is the directing/editing. It's really, really, unnecessarily drawn out. A lot of shots added to make the film more dramatic or engaging, but they're not needed. 90 minutes of Michael Bisping with his charisma and interesting story, with the other celebrity guests would have been enough. Adding the extra (estimated) 20 minutes of ""artistic"" shots really dragged the score down.",False
17,n/a,Entertaining for the first 75 minutes,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I believe this documentary could really have benefitted from (A) another director; or (B) not having Bisping as one of the executive producer (with obvious power on the final cut). He's charming (and handsome) enough to keep you hooked. The movie manages to drag while still dodging the more interesting part of his story. Obviously there are things he doesn't want to share - but those would have provided more humanity to it all. Granted, I might not be the target audience. I would have loved to know more about his parents, his wife's ""purpose"" of just ""being there for him"", what drives him to keep hurting his body, more than what the bros think about him...except for Michael Jai White, who is not afraid to not act and talk like a grown-up frat boy.If the target audience is only Joe Rogan fans pumped by the cringy words of Vin Diesel that ""being an alpha is a pain in the a.."" there is no need of the artsy shots of the gloves and Bisping's dramatizations of his own moves before we see the actual footage. In my opinion, the rhythm changes by the time we see the footage of his wedding and endure the cringy narration of Bruce Buffer. Then, it's more about reliving those fights than getting to know him and his journey right before that.",False

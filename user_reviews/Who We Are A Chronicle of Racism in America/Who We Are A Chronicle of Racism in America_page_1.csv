1,9,Don't stay busy not hearing,zdarov,n/a,16/08/2025,"It has a 5.7 rating at this time, I don't get that! This was almost all new information to me, I'm glad I watched it. There are 1,000 stories under the sun, but it seems that too many of us are busy not listening to this story. Just listening, just hearing. I found his style of presentation and speaking easy to take.. about a bunch of things I didn't want to know. So that's a great job in my book.",False
2,9,An excellent documentary,idlehands-51701,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very well put together documentary that does as the title says. It's an honest look at the history in the United States... I wish my high school textbooks had been this honest and thorough.Who controls the past, controls the future.",False
3,9,Solid documentary,bsaltzm1,n/a,16/08/2025,Would highly recommend to watch this interesting take on the history of slavery and racism in United States from one (very smart and well spoken) man's perspective. We'll put together for Netflix doc.,False
4,10,Required viewing,jamieramage,n/a,16/08/2025,This film should be compulsory viewing for every school kid in the United States.As a Brit now living here I wanted to know exactly what this country's history is - this does this and is beyond uncomfortable.,False
5,10,Skewed ratings,irvnsmithee,n/a,16/08/2025,Great film. Have nothing to add that other reviewers have not already said. The low overall rating for this film just proves the whole premise of what Jeff is trying to say. Racism still lives in this country.,False
6,10,"Sad to see all of the 1 stars, the truth must hurt...",umbiantion,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a beautifully put together documentary. So heartbreaking to hear from the family members of the victims of police murders. It's also heartbreaking that so many of our fellow Americans have such an agenda to deny the many forms of racism that exist today. I hope we can all move forward with humanity as the goal instead of denying others experiences.,False
7,10,What We Aren't Taught Can Hurt Us,charas-91663,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film should be essential viewing.Jeffery Robinson tells a compelling and truthful history of structural racism in America, not to place blame or shame but to inform and educate,If you don't think we have problem with racism in this country, or that racism no longer exists, I urge you to watch the film.We cannot deny our history, or that many of us lived through the civil rights era and witnessed the racism and brutality brought against civil rights activists in the Jim Crow South.It's a brilliant, heartbreaking and joyous film. We are at a tipping point, and we do have a great chance to make real progress if we can only come to terms with our past.",False
8,10,Must see for thoughtful people,susanferguson-34752,n/a,16/08/2025,I've seen this film and met Jeff - this is required viewing for anyone who is sincerely anti-racist and ready to become a part of the solution rather than the problem. If educating yourself is important to you than this is a great place to start.,False
9,10,Best documentary of the year,credico,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have seen Who We Are a half dozen times..its absolutely brilliant on every level. Captivating from beginning to the end..at this juncture in our history , I cant think of another piece of work that as timely as Who We Are..a must watch.",False
10,10,Incredible Film A Must See,nikkicrook-07476,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this film on opening weekend and I am now busily trying to figure out how to get it watched by every one I know, every student in America, and around the world. This is an excellent and important film.",False
11,1,Dishonest documentary,MovieCriticOnline,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was just so filled with dishonesty, omissions of material facts. Do we need yet another film digging up things that happened 60 years ago? No.If it was an honest film it would be something but it wasn't. Lots of post hoc fallacies.I'll focus on one aspect of the film, but this was an ongoing theme throughout the movie.For example, in the beginning he mentions Larry Payne who he said had been shot by police. Never tells us why or what happened, instead, inferring some racial motivation and unjustified shooting. He literally said that Larry Payne ""encountered a police officer and was killed"" inferring some cop just murdered him for no reason, i.e. Because he was black.I had never heard of it, but decided to look it up. Very little information. The Wiki for Payne was scarce and basically repeats the same thing in addition to saying that ""Payne reportedly had his hands up prior to his killing and had asked the officer not to shoot.""And that the police officer ""later claimed that Payne was holding a large butcher knife when he emerged from the basement, a statement denied by witnesses to the killingIn other words, it's the ""hands up, don't shoot"" mantra.I wasn't satisfied, so I dug deeper and found that Obama's justice department looked into the matter and found very different facts and did not pursue the case civilly.This is what they Obama's DOJ found:""Responding police officers reported that they observed the butcher knife at the scene. The knife was retrieved and photographed as evidence. The autopsy revealed significant gunshot residue around the entrance wound, indicating the subject and victim were close to each other at the time of the shot.The autopsy report also noted gunpowder flecking on the elbow of the victim's left arm. In addition, the subject's left hand incurred gunpowder burns, indicating his hand was near the end of the shotgun barrel when he fired the shotgun.This physical evidence is consistent with the subject's claim that Payne's left arm was reaching up and that the subject was reaching for Payne with his left hand in order to restrain Payne, when the subject unexpectedly perceived the need to fire the shotgun held in his right hand."" 2017 DOJ report.The DOJ added that the physical evidence contradicted witness statements that claimed they never saw a knife.This is the problem with 99% of these cases. You hear one thing and if you look into the case it turns out to have happened very differently, but people that have narrative, willfully ignore facts not supportive of their story they want to tell.SHAME!",False
12,8,over that point,biggerheart,n/a,16/08/2025,"What is it like to pick billions of pounds of cotton?What is it like to lose life for being ""too successful""?Does luck look good?This documentary relies on many relevant and clear facts along the history without needing to be opinionated or emotionally tiring. Because it is new, educational/informational, and thereby engaging, watching is quite easy and strongly recommended.The reasons why this rating is not 10:First, while this movie is impressive, I am not sure this artwork can reach beyond the audience who are already willing to be open. To reach the ""unreachable"" might take some more work, admittedly much more work sometimes.Second, in addition to justice and empathy, adding a bit more hope, inspiration, or vision in appropriate amount should increase balance and encouragement, i.e., given the history, why is over the point plausible or not already lost now?PS: There are many 1 ratings now, which shows there is still a lot more work to do.Thanks!",False
13,10,"No Matter Who You Are, You Will Learn Something",spiderman-55910,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm immediately disappointed with how low this documentary is scored. Anyone who would give this a 1... that speaks plenty to the character of the individual and what their values are. This is one of the most enthralling and profound things I've ever watched. It isn't a ""shame on you"" rant, Jeff Robinson is brilliant and respectful; even to those with ignorant points of view. He emphasizes that this country can be both great and have an ugly history. One which is so ingrained, that the struggle to undo its prejudices that even laws were written to protect, is seemingly endless. That's where each of you, your children, and I can make a difference. Simply watch this, and talk about it - with everyone. I promise you will learn something, simply share your knowledge. We can all learn and grow together, we just need to be willing. I hope to see us pass that tipping point in my lifetime.",False
14,10,Gov. Glenn Youngkin and anyone who denies that racist institutions exist in the U.S. should see this movie,lamurray81,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was uncomfortable. I was disturbed by what I saw. Our past is uncomfortable and disturbing and so is our present. Unless we want to continue to repeat the same atrocities, we have got to talk about them and do something to end the biases and policies that allow racism to flourish in the United States.",False
15,10,The Reviews Speak for Themselves,hahedet,n/a,16/08/2025,"You'll notice that every review on this site is 8+ stars. You'll also notice the film has a weighted average rating of about 5 stars. I think that speaks for itself--people who actually went and saw the movie (like myself) realize it is important, impactful, and stunningly done. Those who haven't are trying to tank the ratings because they want to uphold white supremacy in America. They're the guy standing in front of a Confederate statue with a Confederate flag and no idea what he's talking about. Go see the movie, you'll see what I mean.",False
16,10,Great Doc about American History.,SpaceVal,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very important film about learning American history and how understanding that history can result in community and possible progress towards the tipping point.Some topics were new to me and learning them in this manner was eye-opening and inspired me to research deeper. Take the time to learn something new, especially when it involves how America was built.",False
17,10,Powerful,nehemiasbracey,n/a,16/08/2025,Look at all the silent people that gave this 1 star. It speaks to the whole premise of the documentary. People don't want to hear the truth. Unfortunately history will continue to be a lie until we wake up and acknowledge the truth.,False
18,10,A necessary film,richardmillen-819-107687,n/a,16/08/2025,"Who We Are: A Chronicle of Racism in America is a beautifully edited film that treats the subject of racism without hysteria but clearly explains what it is and how it has shaped both our personal and collective thinking. You leave the theatre with so many urgent questions. You feel a deep need to ask who we are and where are we headed. And what we can do now.Who We Are challenges, prods and informs . It leaves us with a need to ask more questions and even begin to imagine where do we go now. It is quickly paced, so at no point do you feel as if this a lecture or that you are being condescended to.Who We Are: A Chronicle of Racism is a superb companion to Sarah Kunstler and Emily Aigner Kunstler's first brilliant documentary:, William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe.",False
19,5,Same Old,mittromney-97797,n/a,16/08/2025,"At some point, when everything is racist, nothing is racist. Is there really anything new here? Yes, there are some interesting and fascinating stories and accounts, but it's been said and done before.Tired of this stuff. And comparing it to the 1619 Project doesn't do this movie any favors. The former is just a bunch of lies and debunked fabrications.Enough is enough.",False
20,10,The Hidden truth about America,larryrobinson-74204,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's disturbing to learn just how much we were not taught about our great country in school. The good, the bad and the ugly are equally a part of life and hiding it doesn't change the past or help the future.",False
21,10,"American Public High School Civics Curriculum Should Include ""Who We Are""",judgydj,n/a,16/08/2025,"To achieve democracy, we Americans must learn and understand our past, the bad and the ugly as well as the good. A poorly informed and/or uninformed electorate has put our republic in dire peril. ""Who We Are"" would be an excellent tool for educating the next generation of Americans about the roots and horrors of racism, which is critical to our progressing to a just and thriving America.",False
22,10,An important film for high school teachers and students!,sharizisman-02260,n/a,16/08/2025,Who We Are made a powerful impact. I'm a NYC teacher who thinks all NYC high school students and DOE staff should see this film.I left the film feeling informed and inspired to keep our eyes on the prize.,False
23,10,Important film,pahill-68836,n/a,16/08/2025,I learned a lot about systemic racism in this country. The history of racism told in a clear and factual way. This film should be shown in every school and college.,False
24,10,"If You Want to Learn More About U.S. History, Start Here",dianamichelecherry,n/a,16/08/2025,"An incredibly powerful film. It's so important to learn this history! Jeffery Robinson is a national treasure and he delivers this urgent message in such an inspiring way. We all must ""know better"" so we can ""do better"". I took my teen to see this film and she was deeply moved. Taking my whole family (kids ranging from 9-15yo) soon!",False
25,10,"A companion to the 1619 project, bringing it up to today",janetelisejohnson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Details our fraught U. S. history built on white supremacy with insight and empathy for those who suffered, but without malice to those of us who have benefited from the system. I thought I knew this story, but there were so many new details, and Robinson helped me understand this history in new ways. I sent my 12 year old so that he could get the truth, and it was a hard but important reality check. Thanks to the filmmakers for bringing this project to all of us.",False

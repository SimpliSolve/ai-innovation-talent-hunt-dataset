1,1,Its 10 Minutes Of Everything That Has Been Told Before Followed By Complete Boring Waffling Nothing!.,silicontourist,n/a,17/08/2025,"I have read a great deal about Michel Nostradamus, the 14 century french prophet and, I own his first and second books of his quatrains. He has made some very interesting statements in his lifetime that have been interpreted in many ways; mostly by egotists trying to make themselves important/famous and thus muddled into a confusing mess. This documentary is narrated in an extremely boring fashion/way, made worse by the lack of anything new or any revealing statements/interpretations from his quatrains!I would have given this a Zero score if it was possible (something that IMDb seriously needs to accommodate the reviewers with) and would advise you to buy his books to read for yourself.",False
2,6,"Interesting, mostly",staunton-gary,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerDo not watch this looking for answers or to see what the future holds. It's a slow burn and could have probably been done in half the time.The end message is about global warming and the destruction of the planet and mankind. Maybe. If we don't do anything about it.Just like his prophecies, the message can be taken/deciphered many ways. There is no clear answers, just the global warming message.",True

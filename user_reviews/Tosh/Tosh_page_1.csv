1,10,What memories,sammhow-50980,n/a,16/08/2025,"The fantastic rise of Swansea City under the stewardship of John 'Tosh' Toshack. Funny, sad, full of nostalgia. I have laughed, cried and cheered I was there!",False
2,10,Brilliant viewing for any football fan,simonfromswansea,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great video of the rise of Swansea City under the guidance of John Toshack, featuring many past players and supporters. Real nostalgic viewing that made me both laugh and cry. Took family member to premiere who thought it was best thing he's ever seen (obviously saw it for real back in the day). Fantastically put together by a life long supporter on a tight budget. Superb viewing. 10/10.",False
3,10,A wonderful trip down Memory Lane,sian-40404,n/a,16/08/2025,I cannot recommend this film enough for all football fans. It is informative and full of wonderful interviews with key players and managers from that time. It also makes you laugh out loud as players recollect fun times. Being a lifelong fan who never missed a match during Tosh's time in charge it brought back magical memories. Don't miss it.,False
4,10,"More than a football film, a human interest underdog story of triumph over adversity",welshpete-41872,n/a,16/08/2025,"Described as one of the greatest stories (n)ever told in football this sumptuously nostalgic film transports the viewer back to possibly the most improbable success story ever in the beautiful game. It'll certainly never be repeated, and how lucky we are that this sensational account has been committed to celluloid for ever more. Watched it three times already!!!",False
5,10,Legend,tucker-65584,n/a,16/08/2025,Brilliant done brought back a lot of memories hope this gives the initiative for the club to recognise John by naming a stand or lounge eg .Well done all involved.,False
6,10,A must for any football fan,ralph-02271,n/a,16/08/2025,"The one thing that's obvious right from the very start of this film is how much love went into making it.As fan growing up watching the Swans rise to the top under John Toshack, the documentary brought back so many fond memories from the era. Seeing the players and the great man himself recall the story on the big screen brought a tear to the eye.I absolutely loved it and I am sure you will too.",False
7,10,JUST FANTASTIC!,emma_andreae,n/a,16/08/2025,"A story that transcends football and will appeal to everyone who loves a romantic underdog story. You'll laugh (a lot), cry (twice, personally) and marvel at what the magnificent Toshack did at little old Swansea. Didn't want it to end!",False
8,10,Informative and entertaining,tim-morris1,n/a,16/08/2025,Superb Documentary about an important period of Welsh Sport. Although I lived through it I did not know a lot of the detail.it gave a lot of time to players who were lesser known but equally important to the story of Toshack and the Swansea years.,False
9,10,Fantastic memories of childhood heroes,flyroy-16426,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thoroughly recommend this great documentary which features many heroes from the youngest days of my football fandom. I'm a Liverpool and Northern Ireland fan, but any football fan will enjoy this. Superb.",False
10,10,Great football story,harwood-60283,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having been fortunate to have been 18 when John Toshack became manager of my home town club and took the club, city and its population on a journey that none of us can forget the film was a great nostalgic journey back to those unforgettable days.The film is much more than a memory jerker. It tells the story of what sport can do for people, both those actively involved and those who bear witness to such events.If you know nothing of football, nothing of Swansea this is still a great, inspiring film to watch.",False

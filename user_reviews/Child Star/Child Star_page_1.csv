1,8,Much better than I expected,katmc86,n/a,15/08/2025,"I put this on in the background while I was doing some work...I soon realized I'd stopped working and was just watching. I've not followed Demi Levoto's career, and only know what I know about her through the media. Hearing her story told like that was eye-opening and gave me a new respect for her and what she's been through.I would have liked to hear more from the other child stars, however I did feel that what they contributed was valuable in painting a fairly clear picture of the impacts of the industry. It also would have been nice to dig a little deeper into child stars of the past as well, however I did appreciate that it included insight people from multiple roles in and around the industry.Definitely worth a watch!",False
2,7,"Kids wanna be famous, grownups wanna make money.",imseeg,n/a,15/08/2025,"Famous childstars on average die 14 years earlier and they have a 4 times increased chance of dying by suicide. Those are the grim statistics behind this documentary which gives a detailed insight into the Disney childstar Demi Lovato... whom I have never heard of but apparently she was HUGELY popular.We mostly get to see demi lovato talk to other childstars (Drew Barrymore and Christina Ricci for instance) and the recurring theme is that almost all of them suffered from their huge fame and started to use drugs and alchohol to cope with a life they had no real control over.These childstars are being squeezed out for every penny they can make and the more popular they become the more a product they become up to a point that certain childstars became wall street products which could be sold and bought at the stock exchange! Currently the childstar content is valued at over 500 billion dollars.Incredible to see how these kids are being treated. Money, money and more money is the culprit behind this behaviour towards these kids whose only dream is to become famous, but adults wanna make money of their fame. The way in which money overrules the healthy development of childstars' lives is what this documentary is all about.This documentary starts out unassuming and without the bleak and grim statistics, but have some patience and please watch it till the end, because then you get to see the real damage done to this famous childstars...",False
3,6,Okay watch,actuallyjessmarie,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was impressed first off with the range of child stars she was able to talk to that have had success after child stardom and were a variety of ages. To be honest I don't think there is any revelations that you will learn from this documentary that you wouldn't already know if you follow the lives that many child actors have had. With the names they were able to get I guess I just wish there was a bit more substance. One thing I wish these documentaries would cover more is the internet side of exploitation with people using children however I think that will have to wait till the children now are older. One thing I did find a bit interesting was seeing Scooter Braun was a producer given the ages of people he has signed and their own issues with fame. Also, why is Keenan wearing sunglasses the entire time, there was absolutely no sun in that diner. I think if you are interested in how child acting can affect the kids this is an okay watch.",False
4,9,i loved it,largeicedteablack,n/a,15/08/2025,"Really liked this. Ive seen demi's other documentaries and i'm usually impressed, but this was definitely the best one. Seeing the same issues, across different generations, they really do only get better in the eyes of law, and worse with the social media and instant access everyone has these days. It was really cool seeing all these faces i recognized from growing up, and how it's impacted their lives. I think overall, i might feel the worst for jojo siwa. Jojo is the first child star, to truly grow up with social media in it's full effect. We saw miley and bieber live with it, and they molded it, but now, jojo is expected to do all of these extra things, on extra platforms. With more merch as things become ""trending"" online faster than ever. Its honestly baffling. I wish good things for these people.",False
5,1,Just Demi Talking About Herself,KySal,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is ironic that the documentary opens with Demi saying she hates being on camera, because here she is creating yet another documentary focused on herself.There are plenty of other former child actors in the documentary, but they don't get the chance to talk about themselves much. Anytime they try, Demi comes in with her own story.This documentary should have just been made to focus on the life of Demi Lovato, because that seems to be the main point of it.There is no new information offered from the documentary. There are no big reveals about the child actor industry. There was a very poor use of the incredible talents included in the documentary.",False
6,10,Better than I expected,hjzprdp,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary is most about Demi, I mean, she's the director and it was her own story who inspired her to make this documentary. The other stars have their part and they're very vulnerable and add a lot to the conversation, and it's good to have different generations on it. It's importante to have more stuff like this. It raises awareness about such important topic. The only negative thing I can think is that maybe they could go deeper, cause Demi has said she was abused on Disney, so I would like they speak about it, but I think it was intentional, maybe she didn't want to go that deep. I enjoyed the doc, it's really easy to digest.",False
7,4,Nothing New. Felt shallow.,kmmaz-02976,n/a,15/08/2025,"Coming into it you expect to hear inside stories and raw emotions from former child stars. Unfortunately you get one child stars story and slightly cooked emotions with the same old stories that we have heard before form Demi. I feel like I barely know the other child stars featured in this documentary, which for something that claimed to show what child stardom is really like and how it affects people later on in life, it doesn't really feel like I got any of that. Christina Ricci, Drew Barrymore, Kenan Thompson, Raven Symone are all amazing actors and whom I wish I got more in depth interviews from. We know Demi's story. Let's hear from some other people. I also didn't learn much of past child stars like Judy Garland or Shirley Temple. The documentary tried to cover over 100 years of child stardom by including current child star JoJo Siwa and the current fascination of YouTube Kids. I didn't really get the meaning or theme behind this documentary. Needed more refinement and a better vision statement.",False
8,10,Demi is incredible and underrated,alicej-13706,n/a,15/08/2025,"Demi had been in the spotlight for many things but what really grinds my gears is how underrated she is. She gets a lot of bad press for reasons I will never understand, when in reality she is one of the brightest, kind and most talented people in the industry.Demi has enormous courage in showing us a glimpse of what it is like to grow up as a child in the spotlight and this documentary is a groundbreaking look into not just her own experience but that of other stars as well.Well done Demi!!! You are absolutely amazing and this documentary will certainly open peoples eyes to what you have been through and what many other child stars have endured.",False
9,3,It seemed oddly hypocritical for this to be distributed by Disney.,planktonrules,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Child Star"" is a documentary featuring Demi Lovato. It ostensibly is about the damage that occurs to child stars...on TV, in movies and on the internet. However, at times it seems more about Lovato in particular and a few of her friends and not the broader topic of child exploitation.If you are looking for an exposee which shows the damage done to child actors by their parents and movie/TV studios, you can do MUCH better than this one. While the documentary talks about SOME of the issues concerning the exploitation of kids in the media, it also seems like it's very careful to excuse the studios and parents. Well, if they aren't to blame for the exploitation....why is?? And, it doesn't surprise me that the film is distributed by Disney...a corporation with a VERY bad history of child stars who run off the rails.The film also seems to be leaving out a LOT in regard to Lovato. While it talks about her recent projects and SOME of her difficulties, it all feels very sanitized and leaves out some very important questions...such as about her parents' involvement in creating some of these problems. The father is never mentioned and her mother is pretty much given a pass. Overall, a mildly interesting film but one that manages to miss the mark.",False
10,9,"Eye-opening, Informative, and Relevant to 80s, 90's and Today's Kids",dakine7,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one show that canvasses the importance of mental health and its effects on child stars from the 1980s to today's rising YouTube sensations. Lovato's compassionate conveyance of such sensitive information is profound and features several A-list stars who faced the same struggles she, very publicly, has faced while working in the entertainment industry. This documentary is relevant for a wide range of demographics, from legal experts and healthcare workers to alcoholics and kids from the 80s, 90s, and today. This film encompasses how, for some celebrities, achieving fame is a miraculous dream and a hellacious nightmare for others.",False
11,4,It's all about Demi,fanofmovies124,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some directors like to make themselves a part of the project, much to the detriment of the project. Nas is guilty of making himself part of docs he directs. Demi Lovato apparently does the same. This is a movie about her experience with child stardom, with some comments from other people who experienced similar. That being said, nothing was new in the doc, just rehashed information she previously included in other projects, with one exception: most states, Florida included, don't have Coogan Laws to protect the income of children; similarly, there seem to be zero (or one with Washington State) that protect child internet performers' incomes. Otherwise, the doc is a massive waste of time.",False
12,10,Such an Eye Opening Documentary,cookcariad,n/a,15/08/2025,"Child star is officially out on Hulu in North America and on Disney+ internationally.If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend that you watch it. You won't regret it. It's such an eye opening documentary.The documentary goes into the depth of child stardom & the disadvantages of child stardom.I, myself, am a 16 year old. Which is only a year older than Demi was when she starred in Camp Rock as Mitchie Torres on Disney Channel. When I was younger, I so wanted to be an actress but I'm so glad that I wasn't. I wouldn't be able to cope with the amount of pressure that is placed on child actors.This documentary taught me a lot of things about the entertainment industry that I had no idea of prior to watching the documentary.So, would I recommend that everyone watches this documentary? Yes. Yes, I would.",False
13,4,So surface level,starlight_kimberleya,n/a,15/08/2025,"There was too many people in this short time to get into anything other than surface level, this should have been a series with one child star per episode. Hour long for each person, details of struggles and lack of support in The industry and how they coped and got to survive today, so disappointing.Think it is commendable though to be at least approaching these topics and having Demi as the lead made sense.Please can someone try this again with more grit. Alyson has so much to her history and we heard hardly any of it just that her and Demi half got on half didn't but understood each other...",False
14,10,A MUST WATCH,dannypelaez-72488,n/a,15/08/2025,I love love loved this documentary! It's gave such a different insight on child actors and the struggles that they had to go through while going into Demi Lovato own story! Very beautifully done. This is something I would re watch with people and I wish they made it into a show so I could keep watching. Demi Lovato is genuinely such an amazing person and has always wanted to help other people and have their stories be told and this documentary is no different... please please please if you have not watched this just take a few minutes to watch the first 5 mins and I promise you you'll be hooked on and watch the whole thing.,False
15,1,Manipulative and Indulgent,edunn-42017,n/a,15/08/2025,"Indulgent and boring, bringing absolutely nothing new to the conversation. The majority of the documentary and conversations with other stars is about Lovato, without any substantive detail of her mental health and ""bad behaviours"" or genuine introspection and perspective. The film is an exercise in narcissistic masturbation.Reprehensible that she bookends the film with children entering the machine to be manipulated and exploited like she was. At one point Lovato says ""it's not like I can just stop being famous."" Yes. She can. Tons of celebrities have walked away from fame.Just...ugh from beginning to end.",False
16,10,I wasn't expecting it to be so good,wwmxh,n/a,15/08/2025,"Child Star is an outstanding documentary, and I absolutely loved it! Demi Lovato shines not only as a director but also as a storyteller. While I've enjoyed her previous documentaries, I wasn't sure how she would handle guiding us through the raw and emotional stories of several child stars. Yet, her personal touch makes the film feel both authentic and deeply moving. The interviews with icons like Drew Barrymore and Raven-Symoné are intimate, shedding light on the immense pressures faced by child actors. Demi's vulnerability, paired with her strength, makes this documentary both powerful and inspiring. It's a heartfelt and honest reflection on fame, and I truly recommend it. I hope this is just the start of Demi's directorial career - she truly nailed it with this one!",False
17,1,The Demi Lovato documentary,cmazon,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is not a general documentary about child actors it is a documentary mainly about Demi Lovato. She is the main character in spite of the lack of substance to her story ( lack of structure when it came to telling her story) . While most of the people she interviewed seemed sincere and vulnerable she appears absent minded and lacking humility. Her lack of accountability for as she described it "" being difficult to work with"" is a turn off. She comes off entitled and trying very hard to make the viewer feel sorry for her when she seemed to be the least affected child actor from the doc. It's a shame Drew Barrymore was part of such poor production.",True
18,10,Absolutely incredible!,mmdkrfzdw,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film goes into drastic detail about the lives of the adolescents in Hollywood growing up in the light of fame. It sheds light on the struggles and challenges it takes to be apart of this lifestyle. While it also teaches many young adults and children living through this now how to conquer these difficult times. 10/10 worth the watch. Cannot wait for Demetria to direct more films in the upcoming future. This documentary was nonetheless of motivational and educational for many looking to join the industry. It's mind boggling to believe many individuals were struggling behind the scenes with whatever it may be. The industry failed these individuals, and this documentary is essentially aimed towards claiming that back. It's hard to live up to your publicized name expectations, but Demi lovato and the others on this film have all made it work. I thank this entire cast for making my childhood and am so sorry all of you had to live through any of this.",False
19,10,Perfect,nicholaspomarico,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thought this was just utterly fantastic. Some people have been saying things like it was too focused on Demi or it wasn't as eye opening as they'd hope, i completely disagree. Firstly, it was Demi's documentary. The reason you think it's mostly about her is because she talks to all the different people, she's in all the scenes and others aren't. However i felt we actually heard less about demi and more about everyone else, especially christina and drew who both were amazing. Christina was honestly like an open book, Kenan felt a bit hidden and closed off, and I thought Raven deserved more time. Overall this was an amazing watch, it was a different approach than other documentaries such as Quiet On Set which I found refreshing. It was more like a group therapy session, talking about their struggles and issues but also the amazing times. Whereas quiet on set felt more like, ""let's expose some stuff."" it wasn't as negative and some people won't respond well to that because they view it as well okay, what's the point of this then. But you can enjoy things while being put through hard times. Anyways, it was great i truly recommend!",False
20,1,I'm so mad I watched this I made an account just to rate it,ksatterfield-65301,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this mistakenly thinking it was Quiet On Set and wasted over an hour of my life for something to happen. Demi talks about being the breadwinner, an eating disorder, and feeling isolated by her popularity. Otherwise, nothing really happens. It feels like she saw an opportunity to jump on a train, but truly hasn't faced the level of hardships her peers have and should have created space rather than stolen an opportunity to talk about herself. Yet again, an example of Demi being tone deaf. Please stop giving this woman your money time and attention and if you're curious about what happened in the 90s and early 2000s in Hollywood to child stars, watch something else.",False
21,10,Nothing but honesty and the right way of interviewing,antobelfi,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found the interview mode very right for the content of the film. Demi was perfect, she played the role of interviewer but at the same time she gave us other details about her life. She gave everyone the right space and he also gave us space to enter a kind of group session.I also really appreciated the way she approaches and responds to the children who are present in the film and ask questions, she was really empathetic, not only with the children but also with the others. It really opened my eyes to the reality behind the lives of very famous children and made me realize how harmful success can sometimes be. Great job Demi, highly recommended!",False
22,10,Thank you.,anaiscoudu,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI've been a fan of demi since I was a little 7 years old and I'm 23 today. Their documentaries are always so beautifully made but also so heart breaking. I realize now what truly is behind the life of a child actor or singer and basing the documentary on Shirley Temple is also an interesting thing. Shirley was being manipulated and had a hard life on her own and you were looking up to her just like the kids today might be looking up to you, hoping they were famous as well. Hoping they would get the fame, the love, the money but you're here saying ""hey, wait a minute. Are you ready for that ?""I'm a big fan of a french tv show, making really young adults start their music career, making them train everyday, sending them on a tour without them being ready for like 75 to 80 shows for 4 months. People thought it was too much, we were seeing them sick and exhausted but they continued to add shows because it was just working so well. But when you said you did that amount of shows in just 3 months I realized how serious this was.I don't really know why but I feel like I need to apologize because yeah, you made my childhood. I've been with you for the last 16 years and now I realize that when I was the happiest, you weren't. You deserve peace demi and I'm so happy to see you having it now. People say you gave up your childhood to give us one. I'm sorry.The artists you met, the children, the activist, the politics. I'll never be the one I was before seeing that documentary.Thank you.",True
23,3,The Demi Lovato and friends show,misti_blu,n/a,15/08/2025,"I started watching this documentary expecting a synopsis of child stars through the decades and what they went through. What I got was a show focusing on Demi Lovato and other actors mainly from the Disney Channel and nickelodeon era with a few short snippets about previous child stars. I do remember the kid from the Cosby show who now sounds like she has quite the attitude and Drew Barrymore of course. I have no idea who the man wearing his sunglasses indoors was but his repetitive speech was terrible nor do I recognize the other featured woman.I'm obviously not the target audience for this show as I was a young adult by the time those shows and channels were popular and I'm not even sure if they were available in Canada. I can't remember my son watching them anyway.There are decades of child actors and if this were the first episode of a series exploring what happened over the years and how things have changed or not changed, I'd have had a higher regard for it.The only relevant points made were regarding laws surrounding resent day YouTube children. That would have made for an interesting show on its own.I really think they need to amend the title to Demi Lovato and friends: Child Stars or something similar so viewers have a better idea of what they will be watching.",False
24,10,Demi is one of the most necessary people for this planet,sofiaramosbasadre,n/a,15/08/2025,"The courage they must have to make such a pure documentary showing the reality of fame at a young age must be highly valued, we must take care of minors and childhood.Becoming a role model without having had any adult experiences in life must be very hard, being aware that every step you take will be judged, you cannot allow yourself to make mistakes, rectify, mature and grow.I would like to thank all the people who have had the courage to participate in the documentary. We must be more open to learning about different realities and less judgmental.We never know what someone is going through until we give them the opportunity to communicate.",False
25,1,"Demi's autobiography: ""Why you should forgive me for doing heroin and assaulting my staff""",tjsmolarz,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHorrendously bias biopic by an artist that has made some horrible decisions and taking nearly 0 accountability for those actions. I'm not deaf to the fact that child stars are exploited by companies for their own gain and usually live empty teenage years. But in the era of ""All Quiet on Set."" That tells the story of child stars who were used and kicked to the curb, some of which are working minimum wage jobs now, it's very hard to listen to Demi, who's still making royalties from her time on Disney, talk about how the child star industry used and abused her. You have Drake Bell who was r*ped and then not believed and is still scorned for his struggles vs. A pop star still on tour, still in shows, still making money daily for her appearances. This show doc comes off incredibly shallow and gives a very strong vibe of an attempted justification self staged comeback tour. All those interviewed are close friends for Demi and her ""break down"" aka a heroin overdose and a literal assault on one of her employees are brushed off as stress induced breaks due to the industry. All and all, Demi saw an opportunity to cash in on the child actor exploration hype and attempted to cash in on.",True

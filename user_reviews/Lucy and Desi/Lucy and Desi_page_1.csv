1,9,I love Lucy was never just a title,jamesjustice-92,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every time I watch a documentary on artists I love who passed away breaks me down to tears. Every. Single. Time. Considering how much I love Lucy and Desi and their show I should have seen it coming a mile away. Even the latest motion picture, Being the Ricardos, has done that to me as well. That says something.Something that has to be said: that Lucy and Desi's story still resonates even after 60+ years after their divorce and 30+ years since their deaths - it's something that will always be in the memory of everyone who knew them, their work and their relationship. A love that never dies, even when the marriage falls apart - a true love will never end. And that's the point of life.No one will live forever but the love of two people will continue on living in the children and many many millions of other people whose lives were touched by those two. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz is a story for all ages and what they have created is immeasurable in terms of greatness.I loved Lucy and Desi, the documentary, and I will love them for as long as I live.",False
2,9,Informative and moving,sateigdraleah,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a well put together documentary on both Lucy and Desi. I've seen lots of things about Lucille Ball so I was familiar with some of what was shared in this but I didn't know much about Desi and his life in Cuba or his start in the entertainment industry. I think it was great that their children were involved in the making of this. There were some surprises about them and great home footage. Anyone who wants to learn more about the both of them and have a look at what went on behind the scenes of ""I love Lucy"" then this is the documentary to watch.",False
3,9,Their Legendary Relationship Resonates Through Their Voices,EUyeshima,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though the tempestuous and truly legendary relationship of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz has been covered extensively elsewhere, Amy Poehler leverages a treasure trove of archival footage and taped conversations with the subjects to produce an intensely personal history that comes across as a heartfelt homage to both their dedicated artistry and professional acumen. What really resonates the most is hearing their voices vividly describe episodes of their lives with such candor and a certain wistfulness that still makes their divorce still feel like a tragic inevitability 62 years later. All the more reason to love not only Lucy but Desi as well. It's very clear Amy does.",False
4,10,Wonderful,rich-fouts,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amy Poehler delivers a masterful review of the rich, varied, fascinating history and story of this famous duo known as Lucy and Desi. Though it comes in the wake of the film, Being the Ricardos, it definitely presents new information and a fresh approach to a couple that's been the subject of many a documentary. Bravo, Amy.",False
5,10,"""'I Love Lucy' was never just a title.",jlfirebirds,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was such a great film! Amy Poehler did an amazing job! It was very heart-felt and touching and just altogether a wonderful picture. It truly enraptures the lives of Lucy & Desi together and separate. If you are a Lucy fan, this is a must-see! It was much better than ""Being the Ricardos"". I know they are two different kinds of films, but, man, this one blows it out of the water. I could watch thus again and again. ""'I Love Lucy' was never just a title.""",False
6,7,Glad that I watched it,asc85,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not only is ""I Love Lucy"" arguably the greatest American sitcom in TV history, it is arguably the greatest American series (sitcom or otherwise) in TV history. So I was very glad I got the chance to watch it, and learn new things about Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, and ""I Love Lucy."" I guess the only people who seem to dislike this documentary are super-fans who supposedly learned nothing new or interesting in this documentary. This reminded me of the same criticisms that ""McCartney: 3, 2, 1"" received from super-fans, who didn't like that one because they didn't learn anything new. Well, I'm fans of both Lucille Ball and Paul McCartney, and I learned new things about both. But I'm not a super-fan of either, so I guess if you are, ""Lucy and Desi"" may not be for you. But for everyone else who knows about Lucille Ball and ""I Love Lucy,"" this documentary should not be missed.",False
7,10,Amazing,srr6288,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a wonderful tribute with amazing footage and stories. I cried. Just watch!!! Amy killed it. Their story is complicated and filled with so much love and depth. I loved the book ""Love, Lucy"" and I feel like this did a great job of summing up the stories from Lucy's perspective as well as Desis. Ugh just so amazing!",False
8,7,Lucy in the Sky,Lejink,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not quite old enough to remember watching ""I Love Lucy"" or any of Lucille Ball's subsequent TV series but I am aware of how successful they were and how important a figure she was, especially as a trailblazing woman in the history of American television. Before that, she was a jobbing actress in Hollywood and as she honestly admits here, knew she was no beauty and basically took any part that was on offer. However, timing of course is everything and she was perfectly placed to play the goofy housewife for the new medium of television in early 50's America, which promptly took her to their hearts and made the ""I Love Lucy"" sit-com the most popular programme in the medium.Right there with her was her equally ambitious husband Desi Arnaz, a handsome young Cuban actor - musician she'd met in Hollywood. Finally able to spend some family time together, they made a busman's holiday out of the TV assignment to make ""I Love Lucy"", finally having a family-life together off screen and of course making a huge success of their fictional home life on screen.This documentary on both their lives was directed by Amy Poehler, a successful female writer - comedienne from a different era. It has to be said it has something of the look and feel of an ""authorised biography"", as witness the substantial contribution to the narrative by their surviving daughter, who probably sees her job as protector of their joint legacy. More revealing are the spoken inserts from a stack of recorded audio tapes left behind by Lucille herself, which are appreciably more candid and less apocryphal, one suspects.A big part of the story of course is how the couple came to be major power-brokers in the television world with the formation of their Desilu Production company which made a host of other iconic shows in the 60's, including two of the longest-lasting franchises still continuing to this day in ""Star Trek"" and ""Mission: Impossible"". It was Desi who took the presidential role in the company, a role he to which he in particular adapted with seeming ease, with Lucy as his vice-president.Even though the marriage broke up with both going on to other longer-lasting marriages with new partners, they continued as business partners and indeed stayed friends for the rest of their lives.Filled throughout with contributions by the likes of Carole Burnett and Bette Midler, not to mention from the relatives of various contemporary contributors to the shows and dozens of clips from all of their joint film and TV ventures, you do get to see just how talented Ball was in particular. With her expressive face and penchant for physical comedy, it's easy to see why the nation loved her so much and for so long. I personally felt that more could have been said about her pioneering work in laying a future path for the likes of Mary Tyler-Moore, Roseanne Barr and of course Poehler herself, but that apart, this was still a very enjoyable if ultimately one suspects comfortable trip through the lives of one of the original Hollywood power-duos, way before that was even a thing.",False
9,10,An Absolute Hit,greeneyedsoul,n/a,16/08/2025,"Desi and Lucy jumped into this crazy new medium called television as a means of being able to be together -- work, family, life, success -- and to experience creating something together. They were pioneers of early television, of course, but they were well ahead of studio executives who didn't think a redheaded American and a charming Cuban could interest audiences. Desi and Lucy trusted their guts and gave us one of the greatest TV shows...ever!Amy Poehler has done a brilliant job of giving us a chance to see Desi and Lucy as more than just icons; she's shown us the flesh and blood humans who changed the world of television, as well as what it cost the couple to succeed as wildly as they did.What a truly moving documentary! I smiled, I laughed, I cried, and I came away with greater appreciation for Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz -- the performers and the people. I also came away with even greater respect for Poehler, who's given us a beautiful documentary about show business and a fascinating love story about people so many of us thought we already knew.102 minutes of awe-inspiring storytelling.",False
10,7,Films topic is nearly irresistible; a pretty good film that lacks focus/substance,dpmillerllc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lucy and Desi had a beautiful relationship and amazing life stories. And then in 5 year window they created and starred in one of the top five sitcoms in American history. I thought that the film lacked a couple key things but overall told the story well and was quite entertaining. First off, the decision to have Carol Burnett as a contributor was very thoughtful and prescient. Lucy and Carol Burnett are the top 2 women of physical comedy. And both of them or in the conversation for Best Physical comedians of all time, woman or man. Unfortunately you have two other apx 40 yr old contributors from some obscure comedy Museum whose credentials are from Academia. I'm not sure why they were chosen or there opinions were selected to be part of the film. It's obvious these two women have been in an academic setting for 50%+ of their lives. They perceive life (likely subconscious and unaware of major flaw in POV) in a way that frames everything and every person as either a victim or oppressor AND irresponsibly assume that because you; or a woman and live in a certain time you experienced misogynistic daily and existed in a social environment hostile to women. Two quick examples. One of these low IQ contributors stated...and this was back in the 50s. Can you believe how much mansplaining Lucy had to tolerate. She made the statement without any evidence. The other contributor stated that in Hollywood in the 50s and 60s women were pitted against each other and female tv / movie stars we're not friendly with each other and rarely had wolves like Ethel and Lucy and the I Love Lucy sitcom. Common sense says that television and movies are 10 and then 25 to 30 years old as an industry and people are just learning the craft and medium and figuring out what works. But no the contributor states the big studios in Hollywood in the 50s and 60s purposely pitted women against each other. Ethel and Lucy were the exception to the rule. And that was only because Lucy was married to the producer. So basically she was saying that Hollywood Studios actively pitted they're female actors against one another and more purposeful and creating and maintaining a hostile workplace environment where female actors we're discouraged from being courteous and friendly to one another. And then a couple minutes later you have either Bette Midler or Carol Burnett contributing and giving their opinion on different subjects on topics all pertaining to Desi and Lucy. To me it seemed disrespectful to those two legends and any other comedy professionals to have those to contribute.",False
11,8,a loving tribute,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Since it is arriving on the heels of Aaron Sorkin's dramatized BEING THE RICARDOS (2021), it's tempting to view this documentary as if a professor is grading his work ... or at least fact-checking. However, Sorkin's film, which resulted in Oscar nominations for Nicole Kidman, Javier Bardem, and JK Simmons, was based on a snapshot in time (and even took some liberties with that), while this first documentary from Amy Poehler takes a much wider lens to the life and career of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.An elite comedian herself, Ms. Poehler's obvious admiration and respect for Lucy is understandable, and her film plays much like a tribute to her hero. She includes brief interviews with such legends as Carol Burnett, Norman Lear, Bette Midler, and Charo ... each who have had enormous success in the comedy field. These folks all tip their cap to Lucy and Desi and their remarkable groundbreaking achievements with ""I Love Lucy"" - the most important, the most beloved, and the most long-lived sitcom in TV history.Ms. Poehler also interviews Lucie Arnaz, daughter of Lucy and Desi. We learn a long-forgotten box of audio tapes was discovered, and that allows us to hear much of their history directly from Lucy and Desi. Lucie adds to the loving and respectful nature of the presentation, although we can't help but notice her brother, Desi Jr, only shows up in one brief clip of a previous interview. Poehler complements the audio tapes with some excellent archival footage, including home movies that add to the personal feel.The necessary background is provided so that we may better appreciate just what these two accomplished. Lucy's grandfather took her to vaudeville shows, and she worked as a model prior to becoming ""Queen of the B's"". Desi's family was affiliated with the Bacardi rum empire and lost everything in the 1933 Cuban revolution when he was 14. He worked in Xavier Cugat's band and refined the ""Conga line"" that is still a party favorite these days. Lucy and Desi met on the set of the RKO movie TOO MANY GIRLS (1940) and after a whirlwind romance, the two were married shortly thereafter.The marriage difficulties are soft-pedaled, and while it's clear they loved each other very much, we learn that due to Desi's stint in the Army and near-constant touring with his band, that the newlyweds saw very little of each other those first few years. In fact, that's what inspired Lucy to demand that Desi play her husband in the new TV show. We then learn about the extraordinary business decisions that were made - not just for the show, but also in founding their own studio, Desilu, which allowed them to own their show and produce others. It was the selling of all 179 episodes of ""I Love Lucy"" that kicked off the whole idea of reruns, a staple of today's television programming.We see some classic clips from the sitcom, as well as footage of Desi performing his signature ""Babaloo"". Lucy and Desi met, fell in love, worked together in the most popular sitcom of all-time, had kids together, built a revolutionary studio business together, divorced, and loved each other forever. Lucie recalls her mother visiting Desi as he lay in bed, slowly dying from lung cancer. She could hear their laughter as they watched ""I Love Lucy"" reruns. Is the story truth or legend? Does it matter? The two had a lasting and historic impact on the entertainment world, both from what was on screen and from the business side of running a studio. And even today, everyone still loves Lucy.Exclusively on Amazon Prime beginning March 4, 2022.",False
12,6,"More informative and interesting than ""Being the Ricardos""",peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lucy and Desi is a story about the life of Lucille Ball and her husband Desi directed by Amy Poehler. It's an overall mediocre but interesting story about the well known model from the early years of comedic shows. There's honestly nothing special as we have heard about this story many many times from other documentaries we have seen throughout our lives. Originally premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, I honestly am happy that I didn't see it because it wasn't worth the ticket to see it very early on. It's well shot, interesting discussions provided but it never was wowing.Rating: B- or C+",False
13,5,Touching but incomplete,mls4182,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary had little new information. It is a bit white washed and skips over the dark side of their relationship. Not surprising given Lucy Luckinbill's participation.Better have Kleenex available for the ending.,False
14,10,So well done,jam77743,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was so good. There's footage in here that I had never seen before and details I had never heard before. Also, make sure to have your tissues near by.",False
15,9,I loved this one.,kkmmbbtx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sure, nothing much too new here, but it had a really lovely and memory invoking feel. I was born about the time their show started. Grew up on all of it. I didn't like Being the Ricardos at all. It felt dark and sad and just not pleasant. It seemed to make them both not nice folks and even their love for each other was tainted.Thanks Amy Poehler for putting together a real tribute to them. I appreciate it.",False
16,6,A Mediocre Take On A Story Fans Have Heard Millions Of Times!,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lucy and Desi is a mediocre take on a story fans have heard millions of times! Throughout the film, you'll be craving a sense of something new and fresh, but unfortunately this film simply doesn't deliver anything worthwhile.Lucy and Desi is a documentary that tells the story of two of the biggest comedians in television, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. The film provides behind-the-scenes clips of the hit show I Love Lucy, video recordings of Lucy and Desi throughout the years, and sit-down talks with some of their closest friends like Carol Burnett and Bette Midler.This film falls flat for several reasons. The story of Lucy and Desi has been told too many times for this documentary to provide anything new or exciting. The timing of its release is unfortunate as another film on the two stars, from the same studio, Being the Ricardos, came out only a few months ago. Lucy and Desi fails to differentiate any information from what the biographical drama gave audiences. Lucy and Desi feels like a watered down version of its predecessors and is unable to engage its viewers. However, it does have some incredible cameos like those by Carol Burnett, Bette Midler and Norman Lear. They give some anecdotes that not many fans have heard and will definitely leave you wanting to hear more of their relationship with Lucy and Desi, which this film does not deliver. The greatest part about the documentary is the romance between Lucille and Desi-their pictures and video clips show a love that is timeless.The film's main focus is the love of Desi and Lucy, how they were able to create a fantastic and iconic series, and still be in love off camera. There are no warnings for this documentary.I give Lucy and Desi 3 out of 5 stars, and recommend it for ages 15 to 18, plus adults. It is being released in theaters and on Amazon Prime Video March 4, 2022. By Heather S., KIDS FIRST!",False
17,8,Nostalgia and insight,brockfal,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lucille Ball became one of TV's early icons after a middling film career; her show 'I Love Lucy' with her real life husband was the biggest hit of its era, but their story is much more than that. This energetic often moving and interesting documentary is well worth watching for nostalgia value as well as well as many insights into TV history and the influences felt even now.",False
18,10,Lucille Ball was the Bomb!,Speedysue2003,n/a,16/08/2025,"I grew up watching I Love Lucy! Best show on television, then and now. This documentary shows the love two people can have for each other and realize they just can't be married. Such respect for each other. Lucille Ball was the best.",False
19,9,Nostalgia At Its Finest,JoshuaMercott,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWith ample footage shared not only from the mega-hit ""I Love Lucy"" TV comedy series but also from the personal archives of Lucille Ball and family, I can promise you that you will find more than you knew before in this documentary.If you are a fan of Lucille Ball, ""Lucy And Desi"" will not only make you chuckle with nostalgic glee but feel that deep and silent sorrow that only follows in the wake of legends whose time has long ended but whose work and memory live on.Great work on direction by Amy Poehler who managed to capture not only the spiritual essence of Lucille Ball, but also celebrities, comedians, and family members who together ensured that this documentary will be one of the top most-seen ones in the Lucille Ball lexicon.One of the most significant 'guests' in this docu was Lucie Arnaz Luckinbill, daughter of the legendary two whose name she bears so elegantly and with such wonderful pride. Desi Arnaz Jr. Lent his voice at one point in this powerful documentary, and so did A-listers like Bette Midler and Carol Burnett.Stories and memories straight from the source, records and chronicles that stood the test of time... These helped define the ""Lucy And Desi"" documentary on Amazon Prime Video. It was every bit as engaging and compelling as I expected it to be.Thanks to the magical work of all the crew members who worked on this project, you will certainly conclude this documentary with a fresh sliver of respect for two of television's finest artists, to say nothing of the woman who became a gold standard and forged an inspiring path for female comediennes and women in power for generations to come.If you can't already guess the 'woman' I referred to, here's a hint: she is all our favourite redhead, and we love her for eternity.",True
20,5,A disappointment from a real fan,yesterdaysprize,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let me start by saying I'm a huge Lucy fan. I'm talking memorabilia, a memorized Vitameatavegamin sketch, and a trip to Jamestown, NY. I know all there is to (publicly) know about Lucy and Desi. I had such high hopes for this documentary, but it fell so short. It missed a lot of important facts about the two of them, and glossed over others in a sentence, leaving viewers lost and confused.",False
21,9,I still love Lucy,brett-76260,n/a,16/08/2025,I grew up watching this show and this documentary is so fitting and so well made... it brings back memories of a simpler time when comedy was clean and everyone could enjoy it. This documentary will take you back to your childhood and even now will make you laugh. It's too bad they will never make a show like this again... we still love Lucy that's for sure and this is easily worth your time... enjoy!!!,False
22,8,Insightful Documentary With Love From Amy Poehler,rkeilitz-19-537915,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was too young to appreciate I Love Lucy and the comedic genius of Lucille Ball. She was also way ahead of her time marrying Cuban born Desi Arnaz who emigrated to America. I do remember my parents telling me ""do not disturb"" when the show was on as they ate their Swanson TV dinners on their tray tables. This documentary is obviously a love letter to Ms. Ball and understandably so as legends such as Bette Midler, Carol Burnett have learned a lot from her. There really was nothing that was not public knowledge about the couple but still a very enjoyable watch.",False
23,10,I Love the Arnaz's,labellav,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember watching ""I love Lucy"" with my mother in the 80s I was literally a toddler but, always remembered and continued watching reruns as I got older til this day. Its always good to see the BTS of those days and especially the iconic pop culture shows. A great ""American Dream"" for the both. And beautiful tribute to their successes, in the show business and of course the love for each other.",False
24,9,There's no half assed success,aarpcats,n/a,16/08/2025,"When Lucy and Desi divorced, I cried inconsolably. As a little girl with few successful female role models, I thought it meant I couldn't be a girl boss and have a happy marriage. In truth, I wasn't all that far off, as over 60 years later male underlings still mansplain to my much more experienced daughter.I am grateful to Lucy and Desi, not only for defining television and the new studio system, but for the role models they provided for a mid 20th Century model American girl like me. I am the breadwinner and I am married to an Hispanic man, I worked while I was pregnant, and I made sure people were paid well. I saw them do it, and I understood that it was possible, even if you came from poverty.Thank you for the documentary, which is the best way to see the extraordinary gifts these two people had. It made up for the godawful Sorkin polemic. And thank you, Lucie, for your always clear eyed understanding of just who your parents were, and just how much it cost them to give their gift to all of us.",False
25,8,Engaging & Endearing,nitro72,n/a,16/08/2025,"Engaging & endearing, this well-paced doc is the tale of two of television's most influential pioneers while being a genuine love story at its core. As familiar as the subjects are, there's still plenty here to learn & enjoy.#nitrosMovieChallenge.",False

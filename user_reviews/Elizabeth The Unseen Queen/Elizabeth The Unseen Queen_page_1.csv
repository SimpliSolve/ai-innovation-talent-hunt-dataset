1,10,Very moving personal account,leeeldridge-80681,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a rare moment to listen to the queen speaking about her upbringing and personal thoughts which accompany some amazing pictures and film footage which have not been seen by the public.Fascinating,emotional and worth watching.",False
2,10,A Personal Reflection,vqvtxxjh,n/a,15/08/2025,"Imagine Queen Victoria had recorded a personal account of her early life ... covering parents and grandparents then marriage and children all wrapped up in lives governed by country and duty. You'd watch it now just for historical interest.This documentary, lovingly put together, will be watched in hundreds of years time given it is personal reflection supported by a wealth of material.",False

4,10,A moment in history,hrhjadejones,n/a,15/08/2025,Absolutely fantastic. Not only does this show unseen footage of the queen but it shows us footage of her grandparents during their reign. An extra special touch is the queen narrates her life throughout this documentary. Amazingly executed by the BBC.,False
5,10,An incredible film about an incredible Queen,tomweakley-tw,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is quite simply a incredible film about an incredible queen. As someone who loves The Royal Family everything about this film is perfect, the score, the old footage being developed after so long, but the highlight for me is having the late, great Queen Elizabeth narrate the footage herself, which, as I watched this the day after her state funeral, soon gave me a lump in my throat. It's also touching to see lots of old footage of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, King George VI and Princess Margaret, who have all sadly passed away now, not too mention King George V and Queen Mary. The score by David Schweitzer is also excellent and provides a great backdrop to the footage. All in all a excellent film about one of the greatest ever Monarchs.",False
6,10,Fantastic,vxcpcsqzs,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having only just lost HM Queen Elizabeth II. This was recommended on the television. Having been released during the jubilee celebrations.It was such a wonderfully put together documentary voiced over by Queen Elizabeth who was reflecting on her life and how she had served. She spoke of her Grandparents, parents, Prince Phillip and children. I teared up throughout and smiled too.I am glad that I had missed it when it was shown in the Jubilee and was able to enjoy it when the whole country, world and I are in mourning, however I was able to enjoy these special moments, which I believe when someone has left this world you should stop, take a moment, and do.",False

1,10,Wonderful show - great royal and photographic history,yerwan1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beautifully done show. Lots of Royal history, but also really interesting insights into the history of photography. Also, very clever having the charming hostess recreate some classic royal photo looks. And, again, lots of wonderful photos of the British Royal family. Loved the show!",False

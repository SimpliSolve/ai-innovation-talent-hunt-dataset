1,1,Dismal,arfdawg-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"You'd think that if the producers of this documentary actually believed this was an important topic to turn into a movie, they would have spent a little more tie researching the incident and put a little more money into producing a quality film.IMBD estimates the budget was around a million dollars.Where did the money go? It looks like it was made with a four hundred dollar cam corder.The film is chock filled with factual errors and the direction is horrible. Given that the running time is a crazy three hours, you'll be sleeping before you know it.So sad that something good could not have been made instead.",False
2,4,Had so much potentional,CeireEConnolly,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI actually enjoyed it except for the hypocritical parts as in all blacks lived in peace until white supremacy came along. Spanish people were all black in 1400s and and white supremacy took over. No its a lie and im sure spanish people lived there before black supremesists tried to conquer and islam TRIED to conquer it aka a form of black supremacy so i wanted to believe a lot of it but how come if the black nations ruled the world there not called black supremacists like hyporicsy is unreal. Had so much potentional. Most nations, countries tried take over the world but its only whites who are evil ffs . Black people here first end off. I watched it as i understand history but forcing the views as its on trend at the minute is not accurate either. Its a way of trashing whites now aday an excuse try push a narrative on trend White people evil black people never done a thing wrong in history. Even tho this prog states black supremacy rules they took over the world before whites . Read your history on ottoman period and european history .The world was ruled by black supremists before the white. Political driven half truthful documentry. As bad as the white invaders but its not mentioned. Race baiting again that is all americans think of first race . Not humanity. Or what really happened in the past.",True
3,5,Definitely Something That American People Should Watch!,silicontourist,n/a,16/08/2025,"Its something all Americans should see and be shown in the school history lessons. I say this because history tells us that it is the Victor who writes the history books but, we all should know that the winners/Victorious were more often than not, notorious liars! American history is well known to hold an abundance of untruths and bare faced lies/discrepancies (the Indian history is a perfect example)!The major dislike I had of this documentary was the way in which the history, of the American Black Maroons, was told. A lot of people were being interviewed and telling the background history but, too many of them were repeating exactly what the person before them had just said and some were just not worth listening to; it got very annoying very quickly! It is also far too long at almost 3 hours long; it could have been told in an 1:50 minutes just as easily...so it may have people sleepy with boredom etc.",False

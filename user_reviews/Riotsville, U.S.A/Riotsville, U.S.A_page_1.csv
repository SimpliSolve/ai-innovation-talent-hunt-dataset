1,7,Law and Order,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. A couple of old sayings came to mind while watching this. ""The more things change, the more they stay the same."" This ties together what we see from the 1960's with what we've seen very recently in the U. S. Next would be, ""You made your bed, now sleep in it."" This references the manner in which our government reacted to civil unrest in the 1960s has affected our society for the past 50+ years.Documentarian Sierra Pettingill utilizes only archival footage from TV (newscasts and talk shows) and military footage filmed during the era. The clips are edited in a way to tell the story of how the government responded to increased civil unrest, and how those responses not only made the situation worse, it also set the table for ongoing societal issues for decades to come.Historical background includes President Lyndon Johnson forming the Kerner Commission (officially The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders), and how the resulting 700 page 1968 report did not provide the conclusions expected by the government. It warned of two societies - one white, one black, separate and unequal. The corresponding action items were deemed too expensive due to the ongoing Vietnam War. Instead an addendum suggested expanded federal funding for police ... that one hit home with politicians.Much of the footage, as well as the film's title, comes from the model town constructed by the military at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. It's here where training sessions occurred with military personnel cast as rioters and law enforcement learned the approaches to quell the uprising. Unfortunately, most of these approaches involved law enforcement escalation during civil unrest, leaving us wondering which causes the most damage. We even see military leaders observing the drills from the grandstands, applauding and laughing in some parts. It's impossible not to notice that these are all white faces.Further escalation and federal funding resulted in specialty tanks, and we see the training videos around this weapon. At its core, what we see is a simulated riot in a simulated city. It's easy to view this as training hate and power, rather than learning de-escalation techniques. Director Pettingill also includes clips from PBL (precursor to PBS) talk shows like ""Civil Disorder"". These shows, and their debates, caused Ford Motor Company to withdraw funding in 1969. The news clips from the 1968 Democrat and Republican conventions provide some insight into the reporting during this era. Especially biting is David Brinkley's response to Strom Thurmond's comments. The film's only weakness comes in the form of narration from Charlene Modeste. The words are simply too flowery or artsy for such subject matter. This is a film that urges you to feel the frustrations. It turns out ""Law & Order"" can be twisted by those in power.Releasing in theaters and OnDemand beginning September 16, 2022.",False
2,6,Dullsville,naq-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was disappointing to watch what should have been a worthwhile project. In terms of the footage presented, we see way more outtakes than the actual controversial enactments of the staged ""riots"" for the benefit of an audience of Generals and Politicians.The one thing that seemed to be a revelation was that the idea of Snipers was actually one which was fabricated by the police in order to show that they should bring in heavy artillery, but the reality is that the snipers were just police plants shooting wildly, even at each other to invoke a response -- there was only one case of an unknown sniper who attempted to shoot at the police while drunk, and so the sniper missed every target.But the problem with the documentary is the frequent use of non-essential footage, ""padding"" the scenes with news commentators prattle, and often playing TV logos and even a commercial or promotional tape in order to add commentary on the alignment of the news media, only to miss the target much like the sniper -- the commercials, as much as they are nostalgic and naive, are wasted material in the otherwise over-long project. Cutting out 30 minutes of this wasted footage would have better served the filmmaker's goal.Of course, then it would not be considered a contender for a Feature by the Academy, which one senses is the filmmaker's attitude in this presentation -- as evidenced by the use of overly dramatic voice-over consisting of poetic nonsense.Since the filmmaker sees the found footage as so extraordinary, we are intrigued by the idea that we might then be able to see the actual riot footage of the real events, such as the Democratic National Convention in 1968, but none of this happens, and instead we are given a somewhat watered down version of the event at the Republican National Convention the same year when Richard Nixon was nominated -- and the protest by a small group of black ghetto denizens was a complete and utter failure.",False
3,7,Welcome to Riotsville,ohstephany-29039,n/a,16/08/2025,An in depth review of the true nature of police escalation during civil unrest. All of which is remains painfully relevant even to this day.I was able to view this during the virtual Sundance Festival.The blatant and heavily institutionalized discrimination that exists from of birth of police is well displayed throughout this film.It's unfortunate that this is still a problem today.Only critique is the editing did feel a bit choppy intermixed with the quotes. Maybe could use another round of editing before wide distribution.,False
4,6,It's Quite Relevant Still,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Originally premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival in the NEXT selection.Director Sierra Pettengill makes a documentary about a fictional town named Riotsville which was built by the US military and explores the militarization of the police and creates a counter-narrative to the nation's reaction to the uprisings of the late '60s. The issues of police and riots are still a very common theme in the modern days. This documentary may be considered relevant in todays time because of all the political things happening at this very moment.The music choice to create an uneven tension really helps to make you feel uneasy of what you are learning, the narration from Charlene Modeste does really help to add an feeling of uneasiness while you are witnessing archival footage of riots and insane things happening. There are some really good conversations from political members, citizens, news people, and others that are presented in this documentary to capture a realistic point of view.However, the editing becomes really sloppy and some of the technical moments are noticeably bad. As if there are some errors during post-production when making this movie. Overall, a good documentary.Rating: B.",False
5,8,"From the sixties till today, repression against protest, any protest is still the norm and not the exception",imseeg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Violent police repression as a first response tactic against protests, still seems to dominate todays American society as much as it did during the sixties.This eyeopening documentary gives us a surprisingly detailed insight into how authorities reacted to the first mass race riots and civil rights protests during the sixties.This documentary has got lots of interesting LIVE public television footage about racism and inequality and police brutality and it uses a police training video for how to handle riots as a red line through this entire movie about how the goverment responded to civil rights protests and race riots during the sixties.In general the government did 2 things to ""respond"" to the protests and race riots:1.The authorities investigated the cause of race riots during the sixties by appointing a commision of conservatives who came to a similar conclusion as the African American people who were protesting, namely that American society was brutally split and full of inequality and racism.2.Shocked by this unwelcome outcome of the conservative comission the government only accepted one tiny subconclusion out of the entire comission's report and that was to give the police more weapons to repress riots...This documentaries' strength lies in the abstract narration and style. Because of that style the total oblivion of goverment officials becomes even more painfully clear for all to see...I have seen several documentaries about racism and police brutality lately and this is the one that got me thinking the most about the world of total oblivion that politicians are wallowing in...",False
6,5,A disappointment,richard-1787,n/a,16/08/2025,"The trailer for this movie focused on the fake towns - they look like movie sets - that were built in the 1960s so that the Army could practice dealing with ""race riots.""As it turns out in the movie, there were only two such Riotsvilles, and they play only a very small roll in this movie. That's very unfortunate, imo. I would have liked to know how they were financed - did Congress know about them? - how the soldiers were chosen to stage crowd control in them, etc. In other words, I would have appreciated it if the movie had concentrated on the riotsvilles.Instead, most of the movie deals with the Civil Rights Movement and white reaction to it in the 1960s. That's interesting, of course, but nothing new. Sometimes it really seemed like filler for a movie that should have been a short rather than a feature-length film.The narration got a little shrill at times for my tastes. The images and newsreel footage that are the basis of this movie are already powerful, and speak for themselves Since no one opposed to the Civil Rights Movement is going to watch this movie, there's no point in preaching to the already converted.An ok movie, in short, but not enough new material to warrant its 91 minute run time.",False
7,4,"Fails to Reach a Conclusion, Omits and Distorts Key Facts to Relevant to Story",jordan-314,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was excited to the screening at FilmForum in Greenwich Village and was hugely disappointed by the meandering, tedious, and pointless mess I saw. The focal point of the climax is a weak case study.What starts out as an interesting reflection on the civil unrest and changes of the mid '60s (calls to end segregation, passaged of Civil Rights Acts, rioting in Watts which are only mentioned in text and not visually) the documentary quickly jumps into the counter measures the US Army took to protect cities following the horrifically violent and damaging riots - the construction of Riotsville to train Army and police in tactics to stop widespread rioting.A lot of time is spent discussing the use of tear gas in Riotsville as a countermeasure law enforcement can use to control riots, as tear gas is (successfully) used to prevent a riot later in the story.The documentary then skips over the massively violent and destructive riots in Chicago at the 1968 DNC by saying ""we all know what happened"" (do we?) and then jumps to the 1968 RNC in Miami beach and a fairly minor incident in the City of Miami where police used tear gas to prevent a riot.When Gov. Reagan is shown at the RNC it is not mentioned he in the gov of CA, implying he is the gov of FL where the convention is taking place. George Wallace (the last 3rd party candidate to receive electoral votes) is only mentioned in the context of the RNC, the director leaves out that he was the governor of AL (which boarders FL) and a Democrat.The documentary could have meaningfully highlighted the injustice leading to riots in the late 60s (Vietnam, segregation, weak economy, rising crime) and it fails to reflect on the victims of Watts and Chicago and instead uses an event, (the prevention of a riot in Miami, which was immediately after the riots in Chicago) to try to reach a conclusion that leaves the audience in confusion.",True
8,2,Aimless structure will test your patience,pcloud_four,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was excited to see this documentary when I first heard about it and sought it out, but in the end it left me bored and annoyed.The director has access to some remarkable file footage, but doesn't seem to know what to do with it. Interspersed with that amazing footage are a series of overly arty flashing collages of ambient video (a close up of TV pixels for several minutes) coupled with grinding tuneless soundscapes and a laughable voice over that sounds like a cross between a bad poetry slam and a hilarious satire of an overly earnest podcast, right down to the slow, labored delivery and over-pronunciation (Think the ""You Must Remember This"" podcast)The director also made a weird choice to not have voice narration outside of the arty collages; instead she has chosen like a hundred title cards in black rectangles in the middle of the screen. It becomes annoying pretty quickly since the file footage is so jaw droppingly interesting.So many bad choices directorially. With the footage they had, this should have been a gimme, instead it's like a high school film students senior project with a fairly dumbed-down historical take.Come for file footage; be prepared to fast forward through the long, boring ""podcast"" segments.",False
9,5,Struggles...,ThurstonHunger,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film struggles with some fascinating archival footage and trying to stretch both the length and message of the film too broadly around that.This country struggles with civil rights sadly over and over again, now to the point where the one thing uniting far too many citizens is an unwavering distrust of the government. Documenting protests is important in understanding both the strength and vulnerability of the not-always-so-United States. That said I feel like any assembly of mobs...protesters (also I guess anti-protesters generally few but vociferous) and then the police force can bring out the mob mentality on both sides.In general color me wary of both, but especially the ones where everyone in the mob has a gun.Anyways this film might best be served by watching the trailer or a sped-up or excerpted version of it. I assume the abridged version won't have the slow zoom and defocus on pixelated faces. Although that would do a disservice to DJ Rupture's excellent soundtrack work.Looking forward...
1) Well I do think for all of the struggles, the arc or the USA does bend towards a better country...often painfully and painfully slowly.2) The notion of test cities for police exercises is still going on afaik, didn't the former Blackwater corporation utilize them recently before they re-branded or whatever?3) Sierra Pettengill might be an excellent resource for gathering archival footage for other directors' projects. I see she was part of the team for the Jarmusch documentary on the The Stooges (with Iggy that is, not Curly).I struggle to recommend this, but with expectations lowered for less of an expose and more of an art collage meditation with occasional Gulf advertisements - it might be worth an hour of your time, although the running time is 1.5 hours.",False
10,3,im sorry charlene...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"But this was far below what i expected from a historical perspective. Its the black and white stigmata over and over again, and what really should be delved with, namely how antiriot enforcement where thought to be and how it came to be in the name of riotsville usa drowns in a claustrophobic, cataclysmic psychedelic epileptic triggering lightshows and overfocused still, and a neoneoneoultra composed musical scored( like norwegian composer arne nordheim) makes this a complete rotten mess historywise. Its narrative voice never tells how much was spended or how large this antiriotforce buildup was, and the real riots that couldve made this documentary a real document of history lacks completely.So if this is how riots have been handled over the years then its time to look somewhere else. As a filmproduct it lacks quality on most bases, and the amount of positive criticism over a ribbed and untelling way to tell a story that has been told here really feels fictitious. The grumpy old man doesnt recommend this one, and will cry out a call to the big documentarymakers to make a series about the real rioting 60's and the real face of the crammed crow.",False
11,5,Too Shallow for Its Message,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's unfortunate when a film has an important message to convey but does a poor job of saying what it has to say. That's the problem with this documentary about the policies and practices underlying government efforts to control violent civil disobedience in major US cities during the mid to late 1960s. It focuses on the training programs employed at US Army bases where model cities (called ""Riotsville"") were built to stage simulated disturbances used for instructing military and police forces on how to quell such outbreaks in line with official government policies. But the film goes beyond that, trying to explain why these incidents were occurring with increasing frequency at the time and why such extensive training measures had become necessary. In doing so, the picture examines the frustrations associated with, and subsequent reactions to, the issues of poverty, racism, police brutality, inequality and the impact of the Vietnam War, among others, principally in minority inner city communities. It tells this story using only archive footage from the time, drawn from television broadcasts and official US military training films. However, given the broad scope of this story, director Sierra Pettengill's third feature outing doesn't delve nearly deep enough into these issues, somewhat surprising given the wealth of material at the filmmaker's disposal. Nor does it tie the Riotsville project to these larger questions as well as it could, relying more on implication than connection. Moreover, this shallow, underdeveloped approach is further undercut by a number of poorly chosen video segments and others in desperate need of editing out extraneous content. Add to that far too many explanatory subtitles and a number of dull, overwritten voiceovers seeking to philosophically elaborate on its conclusions, and you've got a watered down presentation of material deserving to be delivered with a greater sense of hard-hitting urgency. This is the sort of film that should make audiences angry, not put them to sleep, but this offering does more to promote the latter than the former. This is a story that would have been better told through more skillful directorial hands for it to have the impact it requires. Unfortunately, that's not the case here.",False

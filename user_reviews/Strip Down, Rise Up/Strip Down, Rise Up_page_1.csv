1,6,Powerful film for pole dancers and mainstream alike,jackie5678,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is the first full-length documentary about pole dancing I have found, and it is great to see representation in mainstream media. I have been taking pole dance classes for about 5 years, and was a part-time instructor for a few months pre-covid. This review is based primarily off how I feel the film represents my experience in the pole world.
To start off, I love how this film captures the body-positivity and mutual support that is true across the pole community. Sheila encourages the women to embrace their femininity, which is great. However, she seems to have a narrow view of what sexuality and femininity encompasses, when it really should be up to each individual. For example, she encourages one woman to pull her legs together to embrace her feminine, S-shaped curves. In reality, perhaps some women feel more powerful taking up space. I feel it's also worth noting that in my experience, the pole community is also welcoming of men and non-binary people, and encourages confidence in one's self regardless of sexuality or sexual orientation.
It's worth noting that typical pole dance studios do not include the intense therapy component shown at S-Factor. I wish Sheila discussed more about what her qualifications were to act as a trauma therapist. While most fitness instructors do feel part of their role includes some life coaching, trauma therapy is a different beast entirely. I previously worked full-time as a Substance Use Counsellor in a trauma-informed recovery centre, and even I would never get into trauma work with a client until I knew they had all of the tools and skills they would require for staying safe and grounded during that type of work, which would take several weeks at a bare minimum (more likely several months).
I also worry this film comes dangerously close to the ""# Not a Stripper"" vibe without saying so directly. Several women in the film mention how they are afraid to talk about pole dancing in public for fear of being perceived as being a stripper. It is true that as a pole dancer, people who are not familiar with it as a sport or art form may associate pole dancers as being strippers, which is generally not the case. However, sometimes it is that case, and that is cool too. These days most pole dancers realize that the art form has been appropriated from strippers, and that it is insulting to the creators of pole dance to insist on a need to differentiate ourselves from them, based on some perceived moral hierarchy. For example, if you posted Instagram photos of yourself cooking in your kitchen, would you feel the need to write ""Don't worry, I'm #notachef"" ?
Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and shed more than a few tears during emotional parts (which were often!). As the first mainstream documentary on pole dance that I have encountered, I feel that this film may make pole dancing more approachable to some people who were not familiar with the art form, or may have had misconceptions about it. This film will also appeal to experienced pole dancers who want to see better pole moves and tricks than were shown in Hustlers! Sorry JLo :P",True
2,7,interesting portrayal of a unique approach to healing trauma,cherold,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary about S-Factor, which is a franchise that teaches sensual movement and pole dancing. I'm familiar with it because my girlfriend teaches at an S-Factor studio. So I sort of know what S-Factor is about and have a general understanding of some of the hostility towards the film.The movie follows a beginner class taught by actress Sheila Kelley. It focusses on students who are looking not just for an interesting form of exercise (it takes a lot of strength to do pole tricks) but also to get in touch with their femininity/sexiness/whatnot. Many students have serious traumas and the movie shows them working through those traumas in pole dancing. They also spend time in what are essentially group therapy sessions, with Sheila pushing students to open up.The movie also shows us some interesting people outside of the Sheila Kelley world who are more part of the competitive pole world.The stories are genuinely touching. A recently-widowed middle-aged woman, a gymnast who was one of Larry Nassar's victims. We see women relaxing into movement, we see them tearing up, we see them processing their trauma as movement.S-Factor and the movie have a message of pole dancing as empowerment, in which women take back the feminine power and sensuality men are co-opting or closing down. Some people find it ridiculous, but some find it very powerful.SDRU is an entertaining movie, but the few user reviews here as I write this are mainly hostile. There seem to be a couple of reasons for that.One complaint you see is it doesn't represent the world of pole dance accurately. This is probably true, but it's really not a movie about pole dancing in general. It's almost entirely focused on S-Factor, which is as much about ""sensuous movement"" (a bunch of crawling around in sexy clothes) as actual pole dancing. The appeal, as I understand it, is the way it creates a community of women of all ages/body types who go on a journey of exploration of their femininity together. My girlfriend's studio eschews mirrors so women don't get self conscious, so it's perhaps more of a ""safe space"" than some other pole studios. If you want to see a movie about athletic pole dancers perfecting tricks and competing, you will be disappointed, although it does have those and some of what the advanced pole dancers do is wildly impressive.Also, not everyone is a fan of Kelley's pushing women to deal with trauma. She's not a therapist, and from what I hear, while some women pretty much worship her, others have found her approach upsetting.None of this is dealt with in the movie, which focusses on the empowerment angle and the idea of rising up. It's not a deep exploration, which is why it's been accused of seeming a bit like an informercial.It's not a movie I would have watched if not for my girlfriend, but I did quite enjoy it.",False
3,5,To each their own,intensity-79111,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm all about female empowerment and pole dancing. It is a fun and strength building exercise!!And while I can understand and relate to a lot of what these women were going through and the healing they received from Pole Dancing, this was way too heavy on the trauma for me!I started pole dancing because I was bored with my other workouts and stuck with it because it's hella fun ;) and other positive reasons. A cool place to hang out with other women. All that trauma would kill the buzz for me!But super happy the women in the documentary found peace.",False
4,1,Misleading Content,nana-67391,n/a,16/08/2025,"If there's a 0 or -99 for me to select, I will.
Not sure did the producer or production team ever done any research about pole dancing or just stumble upon a random support group that looks like some weird cult and decided to make the show.Pole dancing is nothing like that.It's really uncomfortable for me to watch.Glad that if the cult did help those traumatized women but pole dancing community is a cheerful, supportive and optimistic sport.",False
5,2,Wrong on so many levels,Anna_nef_k,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a professional pole dancer myself, I found this boring, one sided (Jennyne Butterfly was the only sane and real person in this entire documentary) and purely ""American"" (drama and a lot of truly hard emotional stories but the way they directed it seemed to be just for the show and only for the viewer to FEEL something). The whole documentary was nothing but a commercial for the studio of Sheila. Waste of time , doesnt portray the real world of pole dancing by any means.",False
6,6,Give it a try,danaeriley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Im really not sure why other reviews say ""this isnt a real portrayal of pole dancing"".... Um, it's not supposed to? Its a documentary, and i think it is worth watching. As a woman who sees a therapist...from this viewpoint: the classes werent just about the dance, but freeing. if i took a class like this a number of yrs ago & there was a group that would provide emotional support, i would have looked into therapy a lot sooner. I think it gives an interesting point of view of women empowerment through dance.",False
7,1,Nope,abtoennesen-318-788832,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI know that this is a project, but it makes it look like you need to have serious problems to start poledancing. One of the participants described it perfectly: it's basically a soap opera.
Personally I really hope that these women get professional help. Because you don't get that at a polestudio.
I'm a poledancer myself. Started because it looked like fun. Continued because it IS fun.",True
8,8,Reasoning,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"In understand that some may have issues with why the people here started their own journey into pole dancing. I understand that the theme throughout may feel or be a bit of a downer overall speaking. Of course there is the light at the end of the tunnel, that this helped a lot of people overcome judgement, fear and other social anxiety/norms and made them better or happier persons.And that is what the documentary is about. It may not speak directly to you, but it shows what healing effect a bit of self love can have. And I am all about positive messages (even if I am also a cynic at heart - I balance those two things out). You don't have to love everyone involved here, you may not find everything beautiful that this movie delivers. But hopefully you at least can cheer on, with how some managed to put a spin on their life - and there is my daily dose of pun delivered! You're welcome.",False
9,1,Poor across the board,murtaghrox,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst of all, it made the pole community look like a cult. They continuously forced people to do things they weren't comfortable with to gain their view of what expressing femininity meant. It was also widely irresponsible to portray pole class as a way to heal trauma. Yes it can help, but the instructor should not just thrust a group therapy session on everyone and act like they're qualified to do so. Even if she happens to have some qualifications, she did not apply them correctly in any way. This is unacceptable behavior by a fitness instructor. And the documentary has such a narrow view it doesn't really venture outside of this bizarre dangerous behavior, resulting in a horrible representation of the community. All around terrible.",True
10,9,Women Supporting Women,ejmihelich,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film was an interesting watch that tugged at the heart strings. Watching women unlock their bodies through sensual movement was so empowering. The back and forth with competitive pole dancers who do this art for sport and the beginner women who were learning S Factor for many different reasons was compelling. I was struck by HOW many women have suffered sexual abuse or trauma and the power that can be found allowing women to embody their full feminine without the male gaze. If women ever step into supporting one another the way the women in this film do, look out world. At the heart of this film are Evelyn and Megan, both unlocking their bodies that have been frozen for different reasons. I loved watching all the women in this whole movie supporting one another and lifting each other up.An inspiring watch with lots of tears and some good laughs.",False
11,4,Giant trauma dump,Lillyso,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI would like to start off by saying that I do resonate with a lot of the traumatic stories told by the women in this documentary.That being said, this whole documentary really felt like a giant trauma dump and was not really about stripping/pole dancing at all. There was a lot of talk about sexual abuse and can be very triggering so if that is something that bothers you I would not recommend it.The first hour was actually quite good but then it ended up kind of contradicting itself by taking three men and using them for an odd performance.After reading some reviews from professional pole dancers I realize the documentary was not as good as I thought it was.There was next to no talk about actual sex workers and the history behind stripping and most of it wasn't actually about fitness at all. It also fell completely into the narrative of being a woman, identifying as a cis-woman and being feminine so it did not really touch on anybody who was gender nonconforming or transgender.All in all, it was good as far as emotions go in getting to know your inner self and embracing femininity, I don't think they did it in the right way as far as a pole dancing documentary should've went.",True
12,1,....,anastasiamos-77693,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFalls into the ''life coaching'' spectrum where unqualified people are presented as professionals and promise they have the key to happiness (since you're paying a hefty amount of money) with a vague and epidermic approach to it.First of all,the technique of the pole moves showcased WAS NON EXISTENT which could be dangerous considering the fact that your so called healing programme involves acrobatic elements.My main question is..HOW IS SHEILA QUALIFIED ENOUGH TO HANDLE ASSAULT VICTIMS?So why is she the one who gets the platform to showcase her project and come off as a pole community represantative?I get that this was supposed to be about body positivity and female empowerment but the methods the S Factor uses are not the right ones.I hope all the participants find peace and wish all the best to everybody!",True
13,1,Wish I could give it 0/10,u-73378,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerReally awful movie. A standup job in how not to make a documentary. No consistent hypothesis, poor editing, bizarre choice of subjects to interview, really boring. Based on other comments, it also seems to have done all of that while not even giving true insight into the area it's trying to explore. Don't waste your time on even a second of this. Perfect example of the bloat that Netflix is now paying for dearly.",True
14,1,"Not Real World Pole, Just a Reality Show with a Pole In It",mandiiroquois,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a competitive pole dancer, this film angered me, mainly because I feel like it sets our industry back by a decade or more. The entire film was portrayed like the only reason people get into pole dance is to heal past trauma. I feel bad for the women in this film with past trauma however if the directors were going for the real world day to day pole life portrayal,v this is certainly not it. If I had to go listen to counseling every pole class I ever took I would leave depressed and definitely not sexy or happy or powerful or anything in the nature.Sheila only touched on a specific genre of student and didn't touch anyone who loves pole just for what it is- POLE!I wish they would have covered more about where pole originated fron,the different styles and aspects of pole and real material. This was such a disappointment for me and if I were a person who'd never done or seen pole this film would be such a turn off for me.For heavens sakes it was a train wreck. There should be a sequel just to correct the negativity this brings to our sport.",False
15,10,Here for it,lily_rains,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was deeply moved by the courage it took to face misogyny, both societal and internal, to move in a way that women have been shamed out of. It's not a documentary on the history of pole, or the strong badasses that flourish in that world, nor does it disparage those business women. It's a beautiful collection of the different ways some bodies have healed and found joy in this modality of movement. I loved it. I laughed, I cried, and it was a thousand percent better than Cats.",False

17,10,Not your typical pole!,mjanko2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Strip down, Rise Up, is an eye opener on the healing aspects of pole dancing. Not too many people think of pole that way! Director, Michele Ohayon's empathetic eye on women who have healed from all types of trauma by using the pole, is real!
I cried in many places, but felt a sense of hope for these women and was thankful they found healing. They, and the Director had the courage to tell their raw and unfettered stories. Bravo to them!If you're looking for the raw, sexy, misogynistic images of strippers empowering men, than look someplace else. This film is all about heart!",False

19,n/a,Amazing film!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe stories goes beyond pole dancing. It is a powerful film for women and young girls to see. Sexuality is important for both men and women to embrace, but females are emotionally abused, shunned, and judged for embracing their sexuality. This film uses strong story lines, of women getting through their shame and pain with pole dancing. As for the negative reviewers, not everyone gets lifestyles out of the masculine, patriarchal society we live in. Understandably, it is hard for some people to get past their 'idea' of what pole dancing is and what it could be. I appreciated the film and cried a few times.",True
20,4,Lesson learnt,ks-60500,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have watched a Chinese movie about a lost soul do this kind of dancing to find her own identity. That movie is so bad for the actress who act so it didn't bring me any interests about this ""sport"". But this documentary brings along many real examples for people participated, just makes me know the spirit of this sport. It's about believing yourself, don't be shame. Founder of S factor really catch the people weakness to make a success. Lesson learnt how to make a business.",False
21,10,accurate and true exploration of pole dancing,michellerogerson-52448,n/a,16/08/2025,"I learned to pole dance in a similar workshop 12 years ago influenced by the movement of s-factor. Any pole dancers posting here saying they just went to a gym/studio and took a class because wanted to learn probably started dancing later as those studios opened up and it became more trendy. But this is how it began. I found pole to be incredibly healing back then and continue to train and teach in that gym class format today. I like that it covers the competition and performance world but also real women. Pole dancing is for everyone. The mixed reviews here shows pole dancing still carries a stigma. There is healing that goes on, I am grateful for it.",False

My admiration to the women portraited in this film for their bravery in facing their own personal hurt, and big Thank You to them for their bravery in allowing their very personal journeys to be presented to the rest of us on film.

There is a lot trauma talk in this documentary and for those that are ""professionals"", are hoping to learn quick tricks to do for your partner for fun, have great bodies or no shame issues may find the content, reveals and insights boring or heavy. Sheila's ability to see a woman's truth by how she holds and moves her body coupled with her fierce yet tender insight on how to heal, restore, release and rise through movement is unparalleled.

Poledancing, what is this.... But now, I saw it and I was very moved, my girlfriend too. The women touched my heart telling their story and I felt ashamed to be a man. So so much abuse, there really must come balance, the female part in women and in man too must be opened up give credit too, the sensitivity, vulnerability, dare to be open, to cry to feel pain, anger, sadness. Everything is a gateway to healing. Thank you for this beautiful documentary. Thank you all the women portrayed for telling your story.",False

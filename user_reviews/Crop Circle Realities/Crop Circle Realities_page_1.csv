1,8,Informative and Credible,saysjenn,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a very informative documentary regarding crop circles and made me a believer. If you are on the fence go in with an open mind. People that say that crop circles are a hoax are just uninformed and do not know the facts.This documentary backs the evidence up with scientific experiments that were conducted for years. I didn't realize how many there are and the real ones have perfect geometric design and they pop up in minutes. There is no earthly explanation.,False
2,6,"""Crop Circle Realities"" (2021): What is the Real Square Deal?",jtncsmistad,n/a,16/08/2025,"Crop circles have been a confounding phenomena for decades. Historical evidence even suggests that these intricate farmland formations may have been in evidence as far back as the late 1600s.The new documentary ""Crop Circle Realties"", available now on iTunes and Google Play, generates more questions than it answers. Primarily because at present there ARE no answers. Someone, or someTHING, is flattening down segments of crop fields into stunningly meticulous shapes and patterns. Some of this agrarian artwork has been exposed to be elaborate hoaxes, with the perpetrators themselves copping to such shenanigans. Others, however, have NOT been so conveniently dismissed.Having watched ""Crop Circle Realties"", here are some among many puzzling points this reviewer pines away pondering:1. Why are most of the world's known crop circles manifesting in fields throughout the UK? Perhaps the creators are Big Earl Grey sippers?2. These formations are apparently always fashioned in the dark of night. Yet there is no mention in the film of any effort to strategically erect cameras in an effort to potentially capture those responsible for these acts IN the act. Why not?3. The movie tells us that, although these crops are mashed down during circle making, none of the plants actually die. This remarkable oddity, along with the manner in which the formations are actually manufactured, purportedly cannot be explained neither scientifically nor technologically in terms of anything known to, or made by, mankind.4. The suggestion that alien life forces are behind crop circles runs rampant. However, if this is some manner of coded messaging being relayed from galaxies far, far away, most researchers seem to believe that they are communications of a benevolent nature. And that the end game, whatever that may be, is imminent now.If this be the case, do you think our interplanetary visitors can circle their date of arrival for us?It'd just be nice to know when to expect company.",False
3,7,Well done,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe phenomenon of crop circles may have started in England in 1963, but they now are found all over the globe - nearly a thousand have been seen and the first actual incident stretches back even further.While some tricksters have taken responsibility for the creation of some crop circles, Crop Circle Realities seeks out the most incredible crop circle designs and attempts to discover if there was an extraterrestrial connection.Crop circle expert Gary King - one of the leaders in the field of crop circle research, who witnessed a crop circle formed in the East Field site on July 7, 2007 - and UFO activist Stephen Bassett appear in this film to discuss the implications of these crop circles and the messages that they may hold for mankind.If you have the slightest interest in crop circles, consider this film a must watch. Basset is the kind of expert to be listened to and trust and I love hearing his opinions on these matters.",True
4,6,The Signs Are Everywhere,tinseltine,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went to a lecture at the Free Library of Philadelphia back in 2002 on Crop Circles. At that time, I may have heard something about them in the past, but nothing that stuck, but for some reason, I was drawn to this lecture featuring one of the top researchers on the subject Linda Moulton Howe. She had recently published a book called ""Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles"". After the lecture, I immediately purchased her book which she signed. I got home and proceeded to read it cover to cover.I told myself I was going to go to the English countryside of Wiltshire where so many of the formations are found each summer. That I was going to camp out in hopes of witnessing the phenomenon with my own two eyes. But of course I never did that. I don't camp. And I don't do adventuress things. Although, I did get to go to Stonehenge summer of 2018 at the crack of dawn on the Summer Solstice. The only time visitors are allowed to actually touch the stones and be inside the formation. I did this because I'm interested in most things mystical in nature, but particularly whenever the words Crop Circles comes up, my radar is activated; so when I got the October Coast Newsletter of upcoming films, I immediately requested a screener for the documentary ""Crop Circle Realities"" by Writer/Director: Darcy Weir and Writer/Narrator: Geoffrey D. Calhoun.I always find it strange that the Global ""We"" don't talk more about Crop Circles in general. I remember that same year (2002) M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" came out and I thought it would be an intriguing, spiritual look at the mystery, but it barely touches on Crop Circles. There's always talk of the Grey type aliens and alien abductions, Roswell, but here's real evidence that life from elsewhere is trying to communicate with us through mathematics, art and food and yet most dismiss it as a hoax and a lot of people know nothing about it.How can some people believe that humans go out in the middle of the night, where there's no streetlight around and no way to bring that much electricity without someone seeing it, yet managed to create a perfect big complex crop-circle within the hours of darkness... How on earth do they manage and not even a dog awakens to bark? And until this day no one has been caught in the act. Are they so clever to be nearly invisible? What great tools allow them to work so swiftly? And what's the benefit? For that much work would typically be at the interest to make money or hubris to show your art. So no fame, no glory. Just entering pitch dark fields for fun, year after year...This documentary by Occult Journeys Productions shows us image upon incredible image of the circles over the last two decades or more. We hear stories from individuals who have witnessed a field go from normal to Crop Circled in less then a night. We hear the opinions of experts like Stephen Bassett the executive director of Paradigm Research Group (PRG) founded in 1996 to end a government imposed embargo on the truth behind extraterrestrial related phenomena. Historian Gary King takes us inside the center of the circles describing the molecular structure changes in the crops. Also clips of Journalist Jaime Maussan, who frequently reports on this unexplained phenomenon. The film covers both sides of the argument, but like me, clearly feels strongly these messages are of great importance, indicating a warning to all mankind on Earth. Let's just hope we one day stop questioning and start listening.",False
5,9,make up your own mind,xxxxxdarkmoon,n/a,16/08/2025,"I heartily recommend you watch this documentary and then make up your own mind. Listen to what Gary King, a crop circle researcher, has to say about the Oliver Castle incident in 1996: Oliver Castle, a 19-year-old young man, observed and filmed the formation of a crop circle. He was in his tent near the field at night when he heard noises and saw lights outside the tent at dawn. He began to record this with his camcorder. He was thrilled and showed the footage to others 5 hours later, who all confirmed that the footage showed a crop circle that was nearby and brand new. In other words, it had been created the previous night.Experts from all over the world were certain that at the time (1996) it was impossible to falsify these recordings given the state of technology. And certainly not within 5 hours. If it was a fake, how could he create these recordings within 5 hours? And how did he know that a crop circle would appear that night and exactly this formation? 8 years later, in 2004, experts said they still couldn't do it in this quality with the technology of that time (2004). They could fake parts of it, but even that would have taken at least 4 days! 4 days! And there is more evidence that this footage is authentic. The wobbling camera is due to the handheld camera. The camera is constantly moving up and down since the horizon-line is moving up and down. Yet the balls of light keep the exact distance from the field as they move rapidly whilst forming a formation underneath. The balls of light (orbs) maintain the exact distance in the right perspective to the ground in every single frame of the footage, 25 frames per second, where each frame is on a different level of elevation due to the shaking handheld camera. Faking this would be impossible back then in 1996 without traces. Even by today's standards, 27 years later. This only would be possible with the best expertise and best technology, yet it would take more than 5 hours. All of this is evidence for that footage from 1996 is being authentic! Which goes along with a huge implication. Whoever or whatever was standing behind that technology, it hasn't been human.And there are more cases in that documentary. Cases that show footage of quickly moving orbs as well. One of these is incredibly compelling. It was recorded with a public observation camera at Niagara Falls!!!The analysis of the messages in crop circle formations over the last decades reveals a concerning message: here it is decoded by scientific experts:
""Much pain but still time. Believe. There is good out there. Beware the bearers of false gifts and their broken promises.We oppose deception. Conduit closing.""Think about it.This might be a hint and a warning for an incoming extinction event. And if the Earth is going to have an extinction event, wouldn't it make sense for aliens to observe the most beautiful and interesting places on Earth before everything is going to be destroyed?These orbs have also been seen and filmed at volcano eruptions and other natural events, as well as the most beautiful and important and interesting man-made structures. Like in Jerusalem, Gizeh, nuclear power plants, airports, also man made objects such as airplanes, jumbo jets, and so on. These are exactly the places and objects where orbs have been observed over and over again for many years.I wholeheartedly recommend you watch this documentary and make up your mind.",False

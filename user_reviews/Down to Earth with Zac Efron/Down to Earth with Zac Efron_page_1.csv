1,8,A lot of haters in the review section,aminahadziemric,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a biologist/ecologist myself, I found this show very inspirational and adjusted to the less aware people. I found it very eye opening even tho I work with many agencies in my country and in broader sense of Europe that deal with smart cities and sustainability. This is a show for people who do not have a direct contact with these kinds of problems and should be looked at in such a way. Sure, I was pretty much annoyed with the water tasting segment in one of the episodes, but that is only because my country is privileged to have ""fancy"", mineralised water running on tap all around cities. We have to be understanding that for Zac it was the first time he has tasted water containing natural CO2 (bubbles) amongst other beneficial compounds, while I drink it daily for free. We have to understand that cities in the US primarily belong to cars, while in most of Europe I get fine on my bike for longer distances. ""Down to Earth"" is there to present a different perspective and show that we are not alone in the world and what I find normal, some poeple don't and need to be educated. I gave it an 8 because one of the episodes was pretty much boring while the rest was amazing. My favorite must be ""Sardinia"" closely folowed by ""France"" because the topics adressed hit close to home. Even tho I knew most of the information given in them, I loved how they presented it to the wider audience. The hosts have some pretty good jokes and it is very entertaining to witness all of the small things they are impressed by, makes you think about all the things you take for granted. Higly recommended!",True
2,8,I like it,ragolles,n/a,15/08/2025,"First I thought no way it can't be good. But really, I loved it so much. I was learning new things and zac is really funny, never thought I would say that! Just watch it",False
3,7,Why is it out of order?,larmstr,n/a,15/08/2025,The episodes are clearly out of order. It drives me nuts that they reference things that happen in later episodes like they happened already.The show itself is very good and entertaining. A little too much zooming in in zac and the travel sponsors were shown to viewers about as subtle as a hammer to the head.,False
4,10,I love this show,rachelann-59211,n/a,15/08/2025,I genuinely loved this series and the way it was filmed. It enlightens you on how other cultures are living their lives. It shows you how some countries are doing great and others aren't doing so well but we're all responsible for what we're doing to our planet. We all need to do better. Hoping there will be more to see from Darin and Zac in the future!,False
5,10,More seasons please! Outstanding job of educating!,tsta-35379,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolutely love this series! Incredibly happy Season 2 came out and was even better. The friendship dynamic between Zac, Darrin, and the crew pulled me in immediately. I really appreciate the immersive aspect of education through their experience of different environments and showing the impact we have on nature and animals along with ways we can make improvements. They feature quite a bit on people who are paving the way towards better practices. On a global level, environmental sustainability really needs more visibility and they did a fantastic job of showing that in season 2. This series is both entertaining and informative and contributes to influencing taking better care our planet.",False
6,10,Meaningful and amazing.,Its-me-Michelle,n/a,15/08/2025,"I enjoyed every minute of it (well, except for the last 10 minutes, or so). I've binge-watched all of the episodes already and it was one of the best shows I've seen on Netflix, thank you for making this mini-series. Zac Efron and Darin Olien, what a great team, great chemistry. The only downside, it was over too soon.",False
7,10,INSPIRATIONAL,sarahkrudder,n/a,15/08/2025,This show was absolutely inspiring show. It really opened my eyes to not only the worlds problems but also what people are doing to solve this issue right now. It makes me so happy to see that people are doing things to help the environment and that the actor Zac Efron and food health speacialist Darin Olien are spreading the word!,False
8,6,I'm a little torn,patriklindqvist-71983,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well, it is a good show and I love what they are aiming for, the climate and staying healthy.
BUT it's a little hypocritical when they travel all over the world and then talk about how you should care for the environment.
And the obvious VISA sponsorship throws me off a bit.",False
9,10,Well done and thank you!,hintea_dan,n/a,15/08/2025,"A simple production with an authentic and powerful message!Simple words, spot on facts and stories!After watching the entire series I find impossible not to think about how me as individual can make a difference and inspire others to do the same. Small steps in the right direction.It's just us, here on this inexplicable wonder called Earth. There's no one else. So it's up to us to find and maintain the balance of life!",False
10,7,Enjoyed this,alphared_imbd,n/a,15/08/2025,Was awesome to watch these guys world travelling and seeing all the new and inventive stuff to help our planet.,False
11,10,Mind blowing,halloweenhall,n/a,15/08/2025,This show made me rethink a lot of things. We take a lot for granted. Amazing job Zac and Darin!,False
12,7,Zac could do this alone,nicholeareed,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love the educational aspect. I love how beautiful the scenery is. But honestly, the cohost, isnt it. As a viewer, he feels like a know it all and kind of kills the mood.Like your in a chocolate factory saying SUPERFOOD? Dude. Chill. Chill. You're making a chocolate bar with a chocolatier. The term superfood is just so cringy.Okay, let me end on a positive.
I love the behind the scenes. And inclusion in the crew. I love the sacarsm. So relatable.",False
13,4,"Part inspiring, part dangerous",dpo-76589,n/a,15/08/2025,"Darin, Zac's friend, is outright dangerous. The science that the professionals offer as education is fine but sometimes there is pseudoscientific commentary and Darin is truly pseudoscientific. There are so many falsehoods (just from the first part of the water episode which I saved to the last such as ions from waterfalls making us healthy, the ""dangers"" of tap water, water being ""energized"" by the sun, chlorine and cancer). Zac Efron plays his part: a curious and interested person. However he is too easily impressed by Darin.I found that the hosts are frequently arrogant and while some of the things they investigate are highly interesting it somehow gets lost in translation.I was excited when I learnt about this show but now I am puzzled and disappointed. I am a scientist and am worried about the increasing anti-science sentiment and increasing acceptance of pseudoscience in society. This show contributes to these trends. Not overtly but quietly and perhaps unintentionally.Yay to travel, exploration and learning. Nay to pseudoscience.",False
14,9,Good show,jesseburd,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very informative, good show, brings light to things we should all be doing, also entertaining",False
15,10,Genuine and inspiring,thedrisdelles,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not too sure why some people are saying the hosts are shallow or ignorant, I felt the complete opposite. They seemed grateful and genuine. There are some great ideas of sustainability that us idiots in North America are so damn ignorant to, and good life messages in this show. These messages are ones that many people need to hear and need to know, to at least try to be a better human. Anyone giving a negative review; 'what the hell are you doing to live better, be better, do better?' 'What exactly are you doing for OUR world and for others?'",False
16,8,Educational and entertaining,kalinass,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's not the best documentary series that you will watch, but it's compelling, fun to watch, you learn new things and get a glimpse of interesting places around the world. Yes, for some of you Zac Efron may not be the perfect choice for this, but after all he is an actor, not a scientist, and at least he should receive some credit for creating this show and investing money in a documentary series instead of a pointless tv drama for example.",False
17,9,Relaxing,c_bourbeau,n/a,15/08/2025,"Although I do agree with some of the negative reviews; I did enjoy the show, it's relaxing to me especially during these times.",False
18,7,Zac Efron? Come on...he's beautiful. Of course I'm going to watch.,kyleecoyote79,n/a,15/08/2025,"But really this show is so good. I wish I could travel the world and learn things this! I feel like I learned some things when I was done watching.
I am a little worried Efron is slightly depressed. Poor guy! Hope he's ok!",False
19,9,Enjoyed the Show!,heartdaughter,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was like an escape for each episode especially with all that's going on everywhere. I noticed people who were critical said it was because the hosts were superficial but most developed countries' people are superficial and want their way, want it easy, want it now, especially from the USA. They were having fun while finding out about stuff they didn't know.You might know but maybe they really didn't. Most USA'ers don't know it from the perspective of those who live what was shown everyday. We are wasteful, spoiled, selfish, & destructive in a lot of ways. The show was just showing some new perspectives from other countries. Part of the show is about ways to look at the enviroment differently and then they discussed the foods in the area. Some of the food was fancy some was not. It was a travel show with two friends. The bottom line I enjoyed it. I would love to live in Costa Rica. I spent ten days there on the Atlantic side near the Carribean sea. I walked everywhere, ate the native diet and lost 15 lbs during that time. I never felt so alive. I wish I could move there. It brought back good memories when I watched that episode. Pura Vida!",False
20,6,Interesting look around the world,Calicodreamin,n/a,15/08/2025,"An interesting look at food and sustainability around the world, though with a decided lack of focus. Not always sure what the point of the show is, though some interesting concepts are brought up. The obvious product placements go to counteract the vibe of pure and sustainable.",False
21,7,Quite entertaining show - that's it,dburman-15716,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm quite split after having watched the entire season 1. On one hand - I really enjoyed it. On the other, I feel like it has some mayor flaws.Unlike a lot of people I really liked Zac as the main host of the show. He is charismatic, ""down to earth"", funny and more often then not very genuine. I really enjoyed his curiosity and open mind to learning new things. Darin however is another story. My impression of him is that he is a ""know it all"" and often seems quite arrogant. I get the feeling that Zac takes every word of his to heart - which I in a lot of cases don't think it particularly healthy. Their chemistry is a little of aswell, I'm getting the feeling that they aren't as close as they want it to appear.Other than that, there are some punch in the face obvious product placements that I don't think is necessary with a production company like Netflix. I mean come on, we don't have to watch Zac pay with a blue Visa card every single episode. The RVCA clothing seems a bit over the top aswell - wasn't as put of by that but still a bit annoying when it is that obvious.I sometimes feel like the ""science"" behind it all is a bit dumbed down, it has both it's pros and cons. Due to this I think it can reach an audience that otherwise wouldn't be very in to this subject. And for me personally - that made the show very easily digestible and quite the perfect show to watch an episode of before going to bed, so I didn't really mind at all.If there were to be a season 2 I'd still watch it - but my hopes is that the co-host is a different person. Or maybe - potentially even better - zac by himself.",False
22,5,Nice but...,somsakkevin,n/a,15/08/2025,"Don't watch it if you are European. The show is great, but the action of Zac and the other guy shows american stupidity at it greatest.",False
23,10,Using Influence to Educate Minds,aprilosmanaro,n/a,15/08/2025,"At first...I thought this was a ploy to get Zac Efron back into lime light... I was so wrong!
Watching this mini series... you literally see his mind transform and become more aware to the world outside of hollywood. I felt like I too was growing and becoming more aware myself as I watched this series. I'd highly recommend any person to dive into this series if they are eager to learn what other countries are doing to help the world and help humanity.
Bonus: this show makes a point to keep things light hearted as the crew uncovers harsh truths.
There is hope if we stop being so selfish...",False
24,9,Really enjoyed,waylon-payne,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a great show, don't be turned off by some of the negative comments. Some people nowadays are just a misery.",False
25,10,Don't listen to negative reviews,jordanphillips-50817,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show was fun to watch and had many interesting ideas that I had never considered. The negative reviews consist of people being mad that Zac Efron is rich and they are not. You can learn from anything so take the time, watch the show and reconsider things!",False

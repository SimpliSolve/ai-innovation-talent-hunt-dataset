1,10,Honest and Informative,alsepr,n/a,15/08/2025,"I felt this documentary did a wonderful job of showing the lives of the BYU students that face discrimination while being hopeful for change. It showed honest and candid moments in their lives as well as interviews that helped show the pain and passion of these students. It isn't anti-Mormon, for those who worry it might be. It just shows an honest problem that needs to be addressed by the university, and the belief that positive change can be made.",False

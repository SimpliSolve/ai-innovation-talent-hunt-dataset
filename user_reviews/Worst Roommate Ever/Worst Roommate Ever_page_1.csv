1,8,A very watchable series.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix once again delivers for fans of real life crime documentaries. This five part series tells us of four different criminals, with various crimes, including fraud and murder, the only thing linking the stories, is a tenuous story about a room mate link.The first episode blew me away, the most shocking story of the lot, the case of Dorothea Puente, it's enough to give you nightmares for a month. Talk about somebody not looking like they could cause harm to anyone.It's a well produced series, each has some intriguing interviews, and some decent animation which helps tell the story.I wonder if a second series will follow, I'm sure there's enough demand, and material.You may well, like I did, watch each episode, and wonder how on earth the victims allowed themselves to be put into such situations, but when you're desperate for help, financial or otherwise, you tend to believe the best in people. Hindsight is a wonderful thing I guess.Overall, it's a good watch. 8/10.",False
2,8,Horrifying.,Primrose1,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm so sad to see disparaging remarks by other reviewers about the victims in these awful cases. They are victims not actors. Their suffering was and is very real. They don't have to look or act 'the right way' to be deserving of our understanding and sympathy.It would be amazing to think that one of America's many millionaires might help out Sonia who was one of Jason Brachman's victims. She'd worked so hard to get her apartment in Rockaway and lost everything through no fault of her own. I hope she and the other women are managing to find peace and safety in their own homes.,False
3,7,Netflix true-crime docuseries gives you the chills! [+69%],arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"The makers get one part right - the documentary series focuses almost entirely on the victims' perspective - giving them all the time they need to articulate these real-life incidents. Every episode has its share of psychological horror and thriller-like twists, and it's ideal to go into the series totally blank. It really drives you nuts when you know that such crimes happen when digital technology is the strongest it's ever been. Also, some real-estate laws need to be revisited in the concerned states as early as possible. I feel like the makers added specific questions and moments in the interviews to heighten the overall dramatic effect. That's a downer on the part of both Blumhouse & Netflix, I'd say. Nonetheless, the series is one heck of a ride! The Bachman story - told in two parts - is the most thrilling of the lot.Verdict: Worth the binge-watch!",False
4,n/a,wow,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Ignore the poor reviews on this series. This is based on true stories and you can never go wrong with that. These people had this really happen to them and totally didn't deserve it. Very watchable series.,False
5,7,No complaints here,MobiMovieCritic,n/a,16/08/2025,"Have to admit, I'm not the biggest documentary watcher, but occassionally I stumble across one which I binge my way through and Worst Roommate Ever fit that mould for me.Each episode, barring the last two which are the same story, explore a variety of stories where tenants or home owners experience the neighbour (sorry, roommate) from hell.Watched all five episodes in one sitting. Each episode was engaging throughout.And the big question... MINIMAL PHONE BROWSING THROUGHOUT. I think the only time I used my phone was at the end of an episode where I read up some more on the episode I'd just seen.7 stars, but closer to an 8 than a 6, if that makes sense.",False
6,7,Engaging watch.,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI found the series educational, particularly the last story which is divided into two episodes. I wasn't even aware serial squatters were a thing and I am grateful for watching this series because it made me aware of this practice. I did feel the animations were useful but a little too theatrical than informative, especially with the frowns and quick jerky movements of the animated perpetrator. I get it was made for dramatic reasons, but I like my crime documentaries to stick to facts and not overembellish them. Just a nitpick of mine. The closer it is to actual facts, the easier it is to spot these behaviors in the wild.All of the stories were good. The killer grandma story really drives home that you cannot judge a book by its cover. Even an elderly woman, which most would think harmless, can be a serial killer. I was surprised she hadn't been caught earlier because digging up the ground and moving a body should have been a difficult thing to accomplish for an elderly woman. That she had six bodies back there was like Woah, damn grandma! I guess she was pretty strong.The theme of not judging a book by its cover is also carried forward in the charismatic Marathon man. This guy had a bunch of people fooled.",True
7,7,Good,Orange2022,n/a,16/08/2025,"The last victim, Alex Miller was difficult to watch. Should have been narrated by other people, too much acting, difficult to really want to watch what happened due to her horrible narration and ""crying""",False
8,10,This is AMAZING,angelanwalker,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finished this in one sitting. Just wow. Totally not what I expected given the title of the docuseries, which actually irks me because the title makes the docuseries sound like it'd be pretty stupid but when I saw the high ratings, I gave it a shot.All around (again, aside from the title), this is one of the best docuseries I have seen in a long time. Every single person involved with the creation, production, etc., of this show deserves an award or something. It's just brilliantly done.The first episode's story in itself could be a entire docuseries. It was pretty chilling. One of the things I really liked was when the reenactments of the narration are animated and not real-life human actors. I hate watching human reenactments because they're just so dumb and distracting. So the animated reenactments were excellent.I hope this becomes an actual series and not limited because I'd love to see more (true crime fans will understand!). I hadn't heard of any of these cases before and I gotta say they are probably the creepiest and most disturbing I've ever heard of. Absolutely worth the watch.",False
9,7,Almost good,aeonrr,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed the documentary except for one thing. That last 2 episodes follow the story of a serial squatter named Jed Creek aka Jamison Bachman. I felt so sorry for everybody involved that suffered so much, but the victim, Alex Miller, creeped me more than the offender. The way she talked, the facial expressions.... (kinda sociopathic also), reaaaaaly creeped me, had to fast forward all the parts with her.",False
10,8,Wowzer. True Crime at its best.,aarpcats,n/a,16/08/2025,"In truth, sociopaths have an uncanny ability to find vulnerable people and exploit them. They don't care who they hurt, and they are especially good at connecting with good hearted people. They want good hearted people because they are the ones who think the best of others.In many of the other ""Interpersonal"" true crime series on Netflix, these victims are women. For whatever reason, the fact that they are exploited by men makes some reviewers assume the victims weren't that innocent because they are looking to be rescued by someone with money. Those reviewers have trouble understanding just how grim it can be to in the grips of a sociopath, whether the victim is a man OR a woman.This series sets the record straight on who the victims of a criminal are. The stories are chilling, whether the criminal is a squatter or an attempted murderer. The victims are still shell shocked, incredibly honest and good at describing the point of desperation to which they were driven. The crimes are intensely personal, whether they took place in the victim's home or in the loneliness of a foreign country.It's a frustrating, intelligent chilling look into what it feels like to be gutted by a friend or lover.See it. I'm already hoping for a second season,",False
11,7,Don't let strange people into your home,akg1249,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Worst Roommate Ever"" is a true-crime documentary series available on Netflix. It delves into the chilling stories of victims-tenants and landlords-whose lives turned into real-life nightmares after they unsuspectingly invited malevolent people to become their roommates.The series primarily relies on interviews and photographs to tell its stories. Unfortunately, there's minimal video footage, which could have enhanced the overall presentation. Storytelling is straightforward, fast paced, and gripping, but contains no legal details of the cases.This series serves as a cautionary tale, and it underscores the importance of diligent background checks and careful roommate selection.If you're fascinated by true-crime stories and want to learn from others' experiences, this series could be intriguing, but be warned: it might make you reconsider ever having a roommate again.Brace yourself for a chilling exploration of roommate horror stories!MUST-WATCH.",False
12,10,"Trust me, you don't need a roommate. Just get another job.",tafitasoa1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a gripping documentary. Each story was compelling and sad. I found myself frustrated at times with some of the survivors, as they didn't do some common sense stuff (e.g., background checks, googling). I don't want to be seen as victim-blaming; it was just surprising that the level of trust they had with total strangers was so high.I have a lot of empathy for all these folks. These were some very dangerous and sad situations. The 2-part story is especially wacky. I'm happy all of those women are alive to tell their stories. I hope Sonia somehow gets on her feet (heartbreaking!!). Regarding the one who is on with her mom, I guess I see why some reviewers found her annoying, but I see it as her using ""gallows humor"" or whatever as a coping mechanism. She can joke and say quirky things about it now, but it must have been hell.All in all, this was extremely well done. The music didn't bother me. The cartoon drawings were kind of weird, but they made sense. Otherwise, they would have just showed the same photos over and over.",False
13,6,"Dragged Out, in Typical Netflix Fashion",Garoux,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix has this way of taking something that could easily be a 90-minute special, and turning it into several hours of content for the sake of giving people something to ""binge.""The last two-part episode could have really been the entire special. While the first episode is fascinating, the ones between itself and the last are kind of short of content by comparison. Not to diminish the horrible crimes involved, of course, but that what occurred had to be really rolled out to fill an hour-long runtime.Still entertaining and worth a watch for true crime fans, however.",False
14,2,Was great until it wasn't.,theroadtoawesomeness,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerMost stories and speakers were amazing but during the Jamison story the woman tries so hard to be interesting and dramatic to a point it got ridiculous and really messed with the believability.She also comes across low-key psycho.Over the top facial expression etc.,True
15,6,Last two episodes are weak and lazy,premedprincessxo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was a good series but got progressively lower and lower in quality. Then the last two episodes had the dullest story- why did they need to devote two whole episodes to that? Seems they got lazy because they knew the first two would make this a hit. Third episode was decent too.First two were very well done- great presentation and set the tone of ""ok this is not just about bad roommates but horrific crimes"".Then in the final two episodes they want to get back to the bad roommate thing, a squatter. They wanted to build up to the point he eventually killed his brother but what does that have to do with his roommates!? Also, I know the tenant laws too. They could have called cops or gone to their local real estate court- guy will be out of there in two months. But no these people kept saying ~~he knows the laws better than the police cuz he went to law school~~ and had him living there for years, to the point they left their own housing before he did. How about you go down to the court and get a damn eviction hearing!?",True
16,6,"Pretty good, 6/10",chopperDavo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a fan of this genre. The things I liked about this series were that the stories were about fraudsters/conmen and women/dangerous individuals, and the stories were quite well told.I didn't like the use of scary sound effects, ominous music and whatnot. They cheapen any documentary I reckon. In the last 2 episodes, the repeated screen flashes of what happens in the end seemed designed to keep you viewing. Again, they have a negative effect on the quality of the series.I found it hard to sympathize with 2 of the 3 women in the last 2 episodes about the squatter. They made repeated bad choices, which was frustrating to watch. But that was what happened I guess, so that's not a comment on the Netflix series as such.I'd still watch it again.",False
17,6,Childhood friends,staciarose20,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI guess they don't understand that people change, or their true colors eventually show. These people are psychotic! And here's a big lesson. Don't pick your roommate from Craig's List!!!!",True
18,10,Compelling,mattoid-45605,n/a,16/08/2025,"Way bingeable! I love true crime docs and this one did not disappoint. Once I started, I couldn't stop. Watched the whole series in one sitting. The last segment (in 2 parts) was absolutely horrifying! What motivates people to do these things astounds me!",False
19,6,Worst Roommate Ever Crime Anthology,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an anthology crime documentary about exactly what the title indicates. The show tells the stories of the worst possible scenarios among people living together. From the older woman who acted as a nurse and villain to her roommates to the obsessed roommate who would rather kill his roommate than let anyone else have her these are modern horror stories. The stories are told through witness interviews, family statements, and interviews of law enforcement people. There are also numbers of photos, videos, and 911 calls etc. The show also has a number of cartoon recreations of the things being described. These are unique. The show is good but the individual cases are a little longer than they need to be in my opinion.",False
20,9,High quality true crime docs,milburnium,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am writing this after seeing the first episode (there are 5 episodes). Based on the first episode these are 50-minute docs of a very high quality, with great footage that you probably haven't seen before, interviews with people intimately involved in each case, straight to the point without a lot of extra silliness for shock factor. If you're into true crime you will really enjoy this!",False
21,7,True Crime Bad Roommates,lornak-18008,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watch more true crime than anything else so of course I watched this. Right away I realized that the first two stories have been done many many times before. Still, I watched all but the first one.The scariest one for me was the two part one, where the victim accepts a roommate and then can't get rid of him. Serial squatters as they are known. They might pay the first month rent but little to nothing after that. It shows how one man made several women's life pure hell. Scarier still is that the law is on the squatters side. It made no sense and I promise you, it will make you mad.The other one that I was unfamiliar with concerned a marathon runner. He's a con man and manages to get away with a lot of stuff as well-including two different attempts of murder. It was pretty fascinating.I thought it was a fairly good documentary, however I wish they had been more creative and hadn't recycled two old stories that have done so many times. The other thing I really didn't like was the use of cartoon or maybe graphic art scenes used throughout instead of recreations done with actors. It was off putting for me at times. Or maybe I just wasn't used to that.",False
22,8,Enjoyable Series for Crime Fans,noahharrigan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another solid crime mini-series delivered by Netflix. I watched the entire series in one sitting. It's a perfect mix of crime, fraud and murder. The first episode was by far the best in my opinion - talk about an innocent looking old lady that doesn't look like she'd cause any harm?! It goes to show you can never be so sure what a person is capable of, regardless of how old they are!",False
23,6,2 out 4 int bad,stevebrooker,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe 1st 2 episodes were really good, episode 3 ok, episode 4 just dragged.I had seen other doc re episode 1, but this was a good spin.As I said good start but flat ending by the 4th.",True
24,4,It is just ok.,wokkietime,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found the first two episodes engaging and an easy watch. On a side note the Palestinian guy Maher is, in my opinion, quite funny.The last two episodes about Jamison Bachman were aggravating to say the least. Mostly because of Alex. For some reason her manner of speech and her tone of voice are super weird.",False
25,7,Interesting and nicely done,gallagherkellie,n/a,16/08/2025,"The stories are wild!! The interviews are well done, there's plenty of information and the episodes aren't too long. I recommend if you're into true crime documentaries. Lots of crazy people out there!",False

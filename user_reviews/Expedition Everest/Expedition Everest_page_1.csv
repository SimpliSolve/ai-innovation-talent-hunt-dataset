1,6,Interesting concept...,Thanos_Alfie,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Expedition Everest"" is Documentary in which we watch an exciting journey to the top of the world, as a team of climate scientists attempts to summit the legendary Mount Everest. The documentary offers breathtaking views of the Himalayas and the intense physical and mental challenges of scaling the world's highest peak.I enjoyed this documentary because it had an interesting concept and the scientific background was equally interesting with the whole concept of it. The cinematography is undeniably stunning, capturing the majesty of Everest and the treacherous conditions the scientists face. The sense of danger is palpable, and the high-altitude footage brings the scale and beauty of the mountain to life. The adventure itself is captivating and the documentary focuses both on the physical journey but also on the scientific perspective. Lastly, I have to say that ""Expedition Everest"" is an enjoyable documentary and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",False
2,10,Brilliant clear scientific insight,jeg9aber,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really enjoyed this film. There are plenty of other documentaries simply telling the stories of peoples' experience and journey to climb Everest and the inevitable risks involved, but this is different. It is not about individual egos but instead how a group of knowledgeable, specialist scientists from multiple academic disciplines came together with expert mountaineering guides and sherpas to learn from each other and help make the expedition a success. The result is that there is actual real data, collected in ways never tried before to build a credible picture of what is happening in the high altitude environment and how this can be useful for climate predictions and the future for all of us. I especially liked how they overcame the problem of missing equipment at 8000m+ with resourcefulness and gaffer tape!",True

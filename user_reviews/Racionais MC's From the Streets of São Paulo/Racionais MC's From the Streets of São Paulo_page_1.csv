1,10,This refined work piece is just mandatory for any art lover,dudumnz,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the best Brazilian documentaries of all times about art in general, not just because of it's amazing and moving story but it's extraordinary care about production in the smallest details.It shows pronouncedly a very meticulous, sensitive and ripe work of art direction, execution, redaction, editing and finishing as well.It goes much further than bring up a whole lot of historic documents, artistic raw media, news, photos, unique and rare collectibles, but it almost entirely digs up on Brazilian Black movement, history and culture regarding to that specific period so responsibly that it gave result to this magnificent work about the most important, popular and iconic music group in the country.For sure they are much more than that, as it's exposed by the film.. they are opinion makers, educators, fashion creators, influencers in it's true and original concept, these guys transformed minds, worlds and culture.If someone doesn't admire this revolutionary phenomenon called Racionais Mc's it's probably tainted by the disgrace of racism!",False
2,10,Stylish and exciting work of art from the ghetto to the world,hugogabriel-60125,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the biggest rap groups in Brazil that participated and starred in important moments for the history of Brazil, finally wins a documentary with impeccable art.While the story is told by the group's members, family members and those involved, great scenes from recordings of the time told were added.The history of the group itself is extremely important for black and poor people. In several moments I got emotional, many of my friends are not present today and they became sad statistics of how brazil is still a very violent country against minorities. This documentary brought back good childhood memories, listening to Racionais MC's in the circle of friends.",False

1,8,A great watch!,mujali-48677,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this documentary series, perhaps because I went in blind and wasn't expecting such a rollercoaster story. You'll watch this and think that truth really is stranger than fiction. The story is a microcosm of the 80s in a way; Rise and fall, underpinned by vanity and greed, sprinkled with a bit chaos. At the same time though the former Chippendales featured come across quite likeable now, it must be a surreal experience for them seeing that archive footage from over 30 years ago. Also please note there is so much 80s in this that you fear the nightclub sweat might permeate through the tv and in to your living room.",False
2,8,Wilder than you could imagine,blanche-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"The dark, behind the scenes story of Chippendales, the ladies only clubs with the gorgeous dancing men that became such a phenomenon.The dancers they led colorful lives. Interviews with some of the years later tell us that if you couldn't get laid at Chippendales, there was no hope for you. It went on everywhere in the club!But the real story was one of greed, competition, death threats, and murder for hire.You could never dream that behind the enterprise, the calendars, and all the glitz were all those slimy threats and underhanded dealings.Though the story is padded to stretch to multiple episodes, it's still an interesting, entertaining, and absorbing story.",False
3,10,Worth watching. Especially if you like true crime.,helenesteppe,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI enjoyed this series immensely. There was so much crime and evil intent in Nick De Noia. He was a Narcissistic Sociopath with no soul. He literally stole the control of Chippendales from Steve Banergee on contract on a napkin that ended up in death and suicide.I had no idea to that Dorothy Stratten's slimeball husband had the premise of the Chippendales enterprise.I enjoy documentaries and this one did not disappoint. I learned a lot from the people who lived and recounted the Chippendales story. Reality is often worse than fiction. I had no idea of the backstory of Chippendales. Ignore the negative reviews. Watch the series and make your own assessment.,True
4,10,Not All That Glitters Is Golf,srmurray-80569,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great piece of true crime and history of the Chippendales.It Goes to show that not everything that glitters is gold.From the humble beginnings in LA, to the big Apple and the global expansion across the world, including the UK, so seedy it even had Blackpool in the storyline.Yes that was Blackpool Tower and not the Eiffel Tower.Well recommended and great piece of nostalgia.Prime needs better shows to rival Netflix. So many shows are poorly made and presented. This could have been as big as Tiger King is marketed in the right manner.",False
5,10,enjoyed it or not back then...(?)...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Then you will love them after watching this 4 part true crime /entertainment and showbusiness documentary.it tells the story about and the origins of the world wide vigile female entertainment consept called the chippendales, almost bare naked men dancing, serving , kissing and entertaining with just a tong , a wristband and a necktie as costume(at least in the start) for women only!!!You will fall in love with the caracters telling their own stories, stories that men like me wouldve neglected as a pestilence making jealousy boil in every mens hearts back then in the 1980's, and to see them to day , grey and overaged like myself the grumpy old man. Its so well documented in video and audio recordings that this mustve been a everlasting climax for the makers of this series, cause it has it all, men, women, money, jealousy,pain, agony, sex and appeal, and boiled into the core of it all comes the crimes and murder.I have in reviews in the past told about my admiration of popular music from the dancefloor in the 80's and early 90's, and the collection of music that oozes from this material sends shivers up the spine and drives tears in my eyes of nostalgia and a wish to travel back in time, because the 80's is and was the 80's and i lived it...so believe me, the storytelling of this documentary is addictive like coke, not the drink, and a great big recommend, and the award winner is'' curse of the chippendales'' in my mind.recommended.",False
6,2,Tiger King without the tigers,papirna_vila,n/a,16/08/2025,"I mean....is there really not much left to tell the stories about? Or is it the current exploitation of the 80s?I only watched this to end because I share the account with my brother and I wanted to spare myself the shame of having Continue watching: Chippendales.Nothing is new here: lots of money, lots of vultures, drugs....murder is the only logical consequence.Our man Steve could have been a happy guy in LA, but his mom couldn't brag to her neighbours in India about it, so he had to step up the game. Instead of going to the therapist, he decided more money was the right thing to do. Guys under him are the vultures, and the rest.......well, being poor in childhood doesn't justify poor decisions as grownup.Welcome to my Ted talk. :D.",False

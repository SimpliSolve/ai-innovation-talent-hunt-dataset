1,1,Complete Garbage!!!,dbshb,n/a,16/08/2025,"The timelines in this ""documentary"" are so far off from reality. First of all they lumped Poison into the initial rise of the genre with bands like Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Quiet Riot, etc... Why would you take a band whose initial release was in 1986 and group them with bands who were the pioneers of the genre. Mötley Crüe, Ratt and Quiet Riot all had major success with albums released in 1983 or 1984. They were all household names years before poison released their first album.Then they went as far as saying that ""thanks to Spinal Tap 80's music was becoming a parody of itself"". In one scene they described how Metallica's 1991 Black album killed off 80's glam metal music and Spinal Tap added more fuel to the fire. Hmmmmm?! Spinal Tap was released in 1984. Years before glam metal became mainstream, but somehow this was a contributing factor. What a joke!!!",False

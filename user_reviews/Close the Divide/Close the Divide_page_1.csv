1,9,Diverse World View Understanding of Climate Change Action,ceedfmg-47945,n/a,16/08/2025,"An essential film that gets at the heart of why we struggle to move forward productively on climate issues. This film looks at why we talk/yell past one another, move to polar positions and block working together to achieve essential priorities. A diverse cast examines the multitude of issues associated with climate change views/activities and proposes ways to improve our ability to have constructive, respectful and action oriented dialogue. Key experts propose principles of productive communication and conflict that are grounded in psychological principles of hearing and talking with one another that build well considered solutions. Perspective is established that allows the viewer to relieve paralysis and see the ""through line"" to appropriate actions and solutions to today's climate crisis.",False
2,9,Eye-Opening,realskidrow,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary totally opened my eyes. From the start, Close The Divide captured my attention and it never fell off. It felt refreshing and FINALLY someone actually talking about this in a way that isn't totally ridiculous or outlandish.The film doesn't just throw problems at you, it shows real issues and innovative ideas that give you hope - if we were to ever actually work together. The visuals are stunning, kind of showing the walks of life but in a beautiful way that is really human and mixing them with hard truths. By the end, I felt inspired and relieved that this content is actually being made now. This is a must-watch for anyone who wants to understand.",False
3,8,Outstanding Filmmaking,anthonystafford-60153,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are documentaries, and then there's Close The Divide. From the start, it's clear this film is something special, I loved the opening scene of chaos! What stood out overall was its balance. It tackles big issues like climate change and inequality without being preachy or overwhelming and let me decide I felt. Instead, it focuses on showing how people are working together is what creates real change. The cinematography is stunning and the pacing keeps you hooked from start to finish!I'm so tired of the endless protests with blocking roads and making life harder for everyone. It's refreshing to see a film that actually offers thoughtful ideas instead of just creating or promoting further ridiculous behavior and notions.By the end, I felt hopeful and inspired. It's not all doom and gloom but a call to action that makes you want to help. If more documentaries were like this, we might get somewhere. Highly recommended.",False
4,10,Why Aren't More People Talking About This?,kennywalker0,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just finished watching Close The Divide and honestly can't believe more people aren't talking about it. This film is incredible and hits home on issues that feel more urgent every day. With all the noise around polarization and people losing sight of the bigger picture, this documentary couldn't be more relevant. I'm genuinely surprised it hasn't blown up into something much bigger yet. Definitely a must-watch, eye-opening and timely in every way. The interviews are really good and the subjects I found so interesting because they were quite different from each other, and the way it's all put together just pulls you in. It leaves you thinking long after it ends. Like another review said, I was actually surprised at how good this was.",False
5,7,Surprisingly Good,mangosteen55,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't expect much when I started watching Close The Divide. Let's be real documentaries can sometimes feel like homework, and I was ready for this to be one of those. But honestly, it totally surprised me. It's not just full of facts. It's powerful, emotional, and honestly really cool to watch.The stories were what got me the most. The film focuses on people dealing with things like climate change and inequality, but it's not just about their struggles. It shows how we're all getting so polarized, and it's becoming so political that we've lost touch with the actual problems. That really hit me, and I had to think about how I might be doing the same thing! The way the story is told feels super real and different in that way.At the same time, I can totally see how this would make people feel uncomfortable because it seems like we're going about this all wrong. I honestly didn't understand the scale of the problem before watching this. It's crazy how much is happening that we don't even think about. By the time it was over, I actually wanted to do something about the issues they talked about, and that's not something I usually feel after watching a documentary.In the end, Close The Divide turned out to be one of the best documentaries I've seen lately. It's such a great mix of being informative and inspiring, and I think anyone who cares even a little about the world we live in should give it a watch.7 stars.",False

1,9,Great,geekerr,n/a,16/08/2025,Movie i could feel my hands and feet warm..a movie that warms throughout and empowers. Lets people aware of Chinese Communism makes one feel grateful full of love.,False
2,n/a,Poorly made and a collage of scenes taken out of social media like features.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a poorly made movie.I would not recommend this movie. There are better made documentaries about the Dalai Lama. You can watch Seven Years in Tibet or Kundun that are better made about the life of the His Holiness the Dalai lama.In this age there are lots of people wanting to profit using Dalai Lama's name. Even the billionaires want to mis use the name of His Holiness so I am not surprised at all.,False
3,6,A story often told,michelleneiluk,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's very little that's new in this documentary--despite the inclusion of material from Har Mander Singh and his reunion with the Dalai Lama. The documentary is rather formless and poorly edited, diluting the information that is actually new. It focuses almost entirely on His Holiness as a political figure without touching on his critical role as religious leader and cultural touchstone for the Tibetan diaspora.",False
4,10,Brilliant,AJ143-35961,n/a,16/08/2025,"2 of the reviewer's here have clearly misunderstood. I saw this beautiful film in the USA with friends and we loved it. Instead of pre and post film adverts there were.several vignettes around spiritual and cultural topics. The evening was a special event and these clips were separate from the film. The documentary itself is touching, very well edited and sings notes of love & kindness! It touched upon the flight of his Holiness in the dead of night and escorted by Har Mandar Singh, the Indian General who had been sent to help with the escape. Their on screen reunion is so very touching as is the documentaries narrative throughout. See it for yourself.",False

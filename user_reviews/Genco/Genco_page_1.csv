1,9,Tough life.,erhanipekciler,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't where I have to start. Genco Erkal is one of the most important theater player and God save the king! Long live, he is 85 and still young, still active and still perfect. Unfortunately I have never watched him live on stage, I hope I can reach this honor.. As a documentary one of the best. In last years, Netflix documentaries are so good for me ( international or domestic actually, both best) and also I am so happy to see Turkish legend's documentaries in a platform like that. In that way they are really immortal. I loved Yildiz Kenter's documentary too but this is really really good because perfect narration and also nice to see a documentary when the starring alive. His life was not easy, we can understand that and too shame in the years, situation is going bad in here...I hope we can see good days. Genco Erkal is a total gem and I am not sure we cannot understand his significance yet..
Highly recommend to watch. Very nice documentary. Big bravo for producer.",False

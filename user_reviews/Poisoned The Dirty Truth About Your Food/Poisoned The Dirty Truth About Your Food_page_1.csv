1,8,Scariest movie I've ever seen,k_rae_rae,n/a,16/08/2025,"Actually terrifying to realize how dangerous food is and even more terrifying to realize that the people that are responsible for the production and manufacturing of that food literally do not care if you live or die, only that they made money off of you. Definitely a must watch for all Americans. Hopefully the attention from this documentary increase food, safety awareness and drives Congress to be more proactive and make some changes. This documentary was put together very well and I like how they're conducted their own study with the 150 chicken pieces. Very educational and frightening. Definitely recommend for all Americans, as I previously stated.",False
2,8,Straight to the heart.,trulyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Name dropping the brands that have cleared contaminated ""food"" for purchase, resurfacing the incidences that have occurred in the past, hits the large corporations right in the heart. Suggesting at the end what people can do to protect themselves. (Ex. Buying whole vegetables, not prepackaged salad, doing the cutting myself is very applicable to my life)It makes me realize how much more comfortable I feel with buying produce that is local and from small businesses, assuring myself that I'm not eating food's contaminated with salmonella and E. Coli. They put research into the representatives that have the capability to make a difference and why things haven't changed in farming practices.I can make a difference to what I'm buying from the markets with the knowledge that's been shared in the doc. Pretty sweet.",False
3,8,It's a decent view,Noodles88,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just saw the movie and i was curious what rating it has on IMDb, can't say i am surprised.Fortunately there aren't many reviews so i read all of them just to get an idea.Debates are always positive, unless both parties are wrong. I like when a documentary leaves me slightly conflicted because i go to the reviews in hopes to find that random extra information i need to sway me into a certain direction but to be fair, these days is getting increasingly hard to find a documentary which is 100% unbiased or 100% accurate facts and it's our own societal/governmental evolution or rather ""devolution"" to blame for that.Everything now has hundreds of entities that ""govern"" everything in-between, like the LGMA, no one knows who is doing what for who or who's to be blamed if things go (-) (-) up, but in practice we kind of all know that most are doing it for their own self existence, the old ""getting paid by the company that you should investigate"" conundrum is as old as time and just like sugar has now 999 different names on a label, it's getting harder to even know who's who.I'm actually amazed that this docu' managed to pull the Purdue guy, LGMA guy and that ""scientific"" lady only to roast them.There is always mostly one big lesson i learn and consolidate from a slew of very different documentaries, and that is the LAW, the GOV, the companies, never did or ever will care about what happens to us, and that there are a thousands companies getting bribes and salaries for no apparent reasons except play some make believe intermediaries, oh and also wash you leafy greens and cook your meat!",False
4,n/a,"Another ""Blame The Orange Man"" production",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another ""Blame The Orange Man"" production... What *isn't mentioned is ""who"" was in The White House during all the REPEAT Outbreaks! Watch and discern for yourself. The bottom line is, that until lobbyists
are restrained from buying their politicians, the status will remain quo.How about we talk about all the bad policies and their consequences throughout multiple administrations?Anyways, it's made obvious that money talks and b§ walks, but the more light that's she'd on these food manufacturers, the better for us all in the end.Now I'm waiting to see bioengineered foods exposed, and the study of the health affects of them on us!",False
5,6,Food safety,therosesandmoon,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who's not american i think it might be true that they have the safest food supply in the world, but also at the same time this makes me question how did americans survive in other country that has no strict food regulations like in their country. Docus like this feel like a bit too paranoid sometimes but well, it was still a good knowledge for me. I feel like it's gonna be really hard to make sure your food isn't contaminated by bacteria since it's gonna be processed with a lot of hands before it's served into the table. But good job to the people who works hard to ensure customer's safety.",False
6,7,To eat or not to eat?,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - everything connected with food is ... well I understand people may feel quite weird about this. And if you are easily convinced of things ... and this does not only include meat (mostly going after chickens, though sometimes also feels like it is an add for a specific institution, that says it is above the others) ... it has some things to say about your salad too! Yes nothing is safe ... again: maybe not take it literally.Also try to follow some of the tips, because if you want to see something evil, you will see something ... this also concentrates on America! It seems that they do have quite a few issues over there ... their food control is not the best (contrary to what politicians keep saying) ... FDA - not ftw for sure (no pun intended) ...",False
7,9,The safest food supply in the world?,magnoliacream,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone, especially Americans, should watch this. Reports of E.coli and salmonella outbreaks have become almost ubiquitous nowadays that we might have become inured to them. But the danger is real. The segment showing a baby dying from E.coli O157 is the most heartbreaking scene I've ever watched onscreen.It's outrageous how food-producing companies seem to consider their products to be mere commodities, not thinking about how their products would affect consumers. Imagine faking the results of positive salmonella tests so they'd show negative results. Or ignoring complaints about undercooked hamburgers because cooking them more would toughen the meat. Or ignoring reports that processing facilities have live rats or bird crap. Or planting romaine lettuce close to livestock farms where animal waste contaminates the water used to irrigate the crops. These are criminal, causing consumers to get sick and even die. Why are executives of these companies given relatively light sentences considering the danger they've exposed people to?Consumers, this is up to us. Nope, washing fruits and salad greens would not always do because pathogens that may get into crops from irrigation water contaminated with diseased animal waste need to be cooked to be killed. And cooking meat is not enough either because first, meat needs to be cooked to at least 140-degrees F for E.coli to be killed. Second, a pathogen-infested meat can easily contaminate the house if not handled extra extra extra carefully.We need to make the government know we care about not getting comatose, having damaged liver or dying from pathogens in our food. Better yet, elect officials who care more for us consumers than their buddies, the executives/managers of food producing companies. Most of all, don't elect presidents who don't have enough sense not to appoint regulators whose research had been funded by the same companies they are regulating.Europe can sell chicken products marked ""pathogen-free"". Why can't it be done in the US? Why can't we just do things that are right without putting politics in the middle? Politics would be the death of us. Truly.",False
8,10,Eye opening,donumdei,n/a,16/08/2025,"Those people writing bad reviews are just either morons or work for government and meat and produce companies. Watch it, I love documentaries that show scary side of our food industry. If only more filmmakers had the courage to make more and more to wake the public up. We all know you can't mess with these giants in food industry but all it takes is few good documentaries and constantly putting in public's eye and we can together change the industry. Watch this film, it's very educational and well made. I really enjoyed it learned few things. It's insane how little we know
about the food we consume.",False
9,5,Truth mixed with a plea for more Government Regulation,vacommish,n/a,16/08/2025,"What starts as an interesting history of modern day food illnesses, ultimately ends up turning into a commercial for more government regulation from a plaintiff attorney and multiple government representatives and agencies.Food born illnesses are real, but the film chooses not to do the math and put the cases in perspective.Furthermore, the film did nothing to educate people on safe food preparation tips to prevent this from a happening in their kitchens. Missed opportunity or the filmmakers felt it would be better to scare everyone.Beef, peanuts, leafy greens, and chicken all exposed. Shocked that fish/seafood escaped unscathed (except for a late montage oyster reference).It just feels like part of a bigger story - mainly the plaintiff's case against the industry.",False
10,9,Watch it and decide for yourself,jasononeal-38471,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don't listen to anyone's reviews or political ideologies unless you've watched it yourself. This documentary will not provide any new information about our corporate controlled food systems and the regulatory capture of government oversight. However, it does an excellent job of providing narratives and interviews from all stakeholders involved. Consumers, regulators, producers, lobbyists, scientists, and government officials are given a chance to tell their story. You will have enough information to make better choices for yourself and your family. At the end of the day, you can't trust anyone involved in creating the problem to solve that problem.",False
11,10,Honest depiction of food industry in USA,movieslinger-84949,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary should be required watching for every American. If you think a food borne illness can't happen to you, you're sadly mistaken.It's easy to say consumers should cook and/or wash the food they prepare properly. It's harder to understand that the US claims to have the safest food supply in the world, yet regulations are not always enforced. Yes, the consumer has responsibility, but shouldn't we, as Americans be able to trust the USDA, FDA and other regulatory boards to do their jobs?The leafy greens section of this doc should put the fear of God in us all. That run off water from livestock is not only in close proximity to crops but probably being used to water these crops while the farmers are pretty much self regulated should have us all thinking twice.The experts in this doc are well educated and knowledgeable. I don't understand some of the negativity in the reviews. They are doing more for us than Congress is doing.With anything, be objective while viewing. It's an interesting take on the food industry and I'd be interested to see a second part expanding on other foods and what we can do to stay safe.",True
12,9,"Short, fascinating insight into the truth about our food",wellthatswhatithinkanyway,n/a,16/08/2025,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulIn the early 90's, an outbreak of e-coli swept the United States, leading to mass hospitalisations and even deaths. This was followed shortly afterwards by an outbreak of salmonella that caused similar havoc, and the fingers all pointed back to factory farming methods, and the lax standards that were followed, as well as corporate pressure to meet targets rather than ensure safety. But the outbreak was not confined merely to the meat industry, but also to other unlikely sources, including green food such as salad.One of the 'Brexit Benefits' hailed to many of the population was a trade deal on food with the United States, which was countered with their use of 'chlorinated chicken', and the unhygienic methods employed in the U. S. industry in comparison to the more regulated European model. To date, that appears to have been averted, however this documentary from writer Jeff Benedict and director Stephanie Soechtig casts a more unnerving spectre on the food we consume on a daily basis in general.If the dodgy practices of the food companies whose bottom line is to make a buck are unsurprising, you'd like to think the regulatory agencies whose primary role is to keep the public safe would be reliable, but as Soechtig's documentary unravels, it's hard to decipher which one is which, or which department is even responsible for what. A certification of safety from any agency is revealed as no guarantee of safety, leaving an even more unsettling feeling in the stomach.A short, sharp stab at an industry geared to a specific human need, Soechtig's film reveals itself as further proof that Netflix can still pull a decent documentary out the bag when it needs to. ****",False
13,4,A Lackluster Attempt at Exposing Food Safety Issues,carsten-breum,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Poisoned: The Dirty Truth About Your Food"" is a Netflix documentary that aims to shed light on the dangers of bacteria, particularly E. Coli O157 and salmonella, lurking in our food supply, causing severe illnesses and fatalities. The film follows a lawyer's pursuit of justice against major food corporations responsible for people falling sick or losing their lives due to contaminated products.While the documentary touches upon the crucial issue of foodborne illnesses and the need for responsible food manufacturing practices, it fails to deliver on its promise. Throughout the film, the narrative is often repetitive and overly focused on basic knowledge that any informed viewer would already be familiar with. This lack of depth and fresh insights results in a tedious viewing experience that leaves much to be desired.The documentary does present a fair argument about the importance of food safety, but it ultimately falls short in delivering a compelling message. Despite the emotional impact of personal accounts from affected individuals, the film lacks a cohesive structure and fails to make a strong case against the big food corporations it targets. As a result, it struggles to engage its audience effectively.One of the few commendable aspects of the documentary is its exploration of the risks associated with consuming Romaine salad contaminated with salmonella. However, this limited focus does little to redeem the film from its overall mediocrity. The audience is left craving more in-depth analysis and investigation into the root causes of foodborne illnesses and the reasons behind the corporations' negligence.In conclusion, ""Poisoned: The Dirty Truth About Your Food"" is a missed opportunity to deliver a hard-hitting exposé on food safety issues. While it briefly touches on the severity of the problem and the devastating consequences for victims, it fails to sustain the viewers' interest due to its repetitive and shallow approach. The lack of substantial content and the absence of a compelling argument make this documentary a disappointing watch, leaving viewers with unanswered questions and a sense of unfulfilled potential.",False
14,4,"High ratings= high approval, low opposite. Hmm",richardrc-18596,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oneanjel has a great review already. Top of the list as of today. Check it out. With that said, this was interesting at first, then, I agree, it came off as a bleeding heart big bad salmonella lurking everywhere we need more gubmint to run our lives infomercial. Nope. Not gonna happen.The whole E. Coli on chicken or whatever thing they are trying to prove is confusing and laughable. So, if I understand, 20ish percent of chicken pieces wrapped and sold in packaging out of 150 total had E. Coli on the raw chicken. Right? So common sense would tell me that I need to cook that chicken to temp. And then use a disinfectant wipe on counter when done unwrapping it. And wash my hands with some soap. Try to avoid touching stuff. Right? That's common sense and has been common sense in the country forever. Maybe city dwellers, like their example in the video, don't get it.The reason this doesn't get a 1 is because the greens. Yep, the presentation presented in Regards to bagged lettuce is unreal. Most comes from fields right by cattle yards. Duh, your gonna get disease and bacteria on that stuff. But, that sounds like an AZ or CA state regulatory issue imo. Not a uniparty DC never get anything done issue. But don't hold high hopes to get it resolved from the ""Republican"" AZ majority. The bozos in that state still allow mail in voting after countless evidence proved it resulted in mass fraud in the past 2 election cycles. Can will be kicked down the road. We all suffer.Purple haired lady? Uh no. Your not getting more power. I think banning gas ovens, brick ovens, and gas powered vehicles by whatever date they think it's gonna happen is enough power. And that's just some of the daddy gubmint overreach they try in this admin. You don't need to hire some 3rd party ""green"" energy company that gets gubmint handouts to ""regulate"" the food industry more. The crooks at the top will just find other means to break your rules.How bout we Enforce what's on the books.makes sense right? But don't hold your breath folks.

15,2,Personal responsibility v mindless gluttony,OneAnjel,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis films main goal is to make the government responsible for our well-being. In the 60s and 70s it was popular to discuss that the more laws we implement, the more problems they will be with people trying to skirt the laws rather than rely on common sense and mutual respect. Clearly, though, that ship has sailed. As a US citizen who is very proud of their country, until the current Administration was installed, I also recognize that we have implemented so many laws in trying to manage the freedoms we offer that Industries have taken to making sure they just barely stay within the laws and find loopholes by hiring top notch attorneys and lobbyists. But what do salmonella and cancer have in common? They are not as prevalent in other countries. So while this film tries to make the government wholly responsible, the real detriment in the US is how we manufacture things that in our grandparents day was much more wholesome. I was born in the 60s, and back then we relied on common sense. We knew better than eat undercooked meat or to blindly feed things to our children. We ate whole foods because packaged processed foods were not really very common--they were created for the war to have things that did not need refrigeration for boots on the ground. They knew then that processed foods were not healthy for long term. But we have this huge ability to market and sell virtually anything we want to in order to create wealth. And so even milk became something that was allowed to be sold en mass after the FDA was convinced that adding calcium to milk would resolve the problem of pasturized milk depleting the body of calcium , eventually destoying bones. And although I disliked one comment that said the film was a missed opportunity, I can agree that it had very pedestrian information. But I can tell you re their opening line that we should not consume so much produce and meats: in this documentary it claims up to 500 people a year die from foodborne illness; but what they do not say is that over 300,000 per year expire from obesity, which has been proven to be the result of packaged processed foods and fast foods. One is a quick death; the other takes years and destroys quality of life and consumes billions of tax payer dollars in on-going medical care. The ideal way to really keep your family safe is to eat at home and buy local foods, and avoid package denature foods and toxic fast foods. But truly if we were a more family and socially oriented society rather than driven by media and marketing, we would have all learned to cook our food thoroughly and to eat 99% of our food at home. Sometimes disease kills us because of our weakened immune system due to fast food and packaged foods. Someone who eats whole foods and local grown is going to be have a stronger immune system than someone who has dined on the dollar menu for most of their meals and, sadly, that describes many of our inner city children today. Modern disease like cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis and Alzheimer are all associated with processed foods and processed animal products. Americans have become super consumers who believe that everything should be fast and tasty no longer taught to wash everything correctly or cook everything correctly by fatiqued parents who are victims of food, envornment and air toxins they didnt even know existed in the 80s and 90s. If Europe has discovered a way to remove 50% of the salmonella then it does sound like we have that capability, as well. But is 50% enough? I think that trying to make the government responsible for everything is turning us into the whiny liberal state that social media would have us believe is the majority. I personally dont believe that is what the US stands for. We should all be intelligent consumers. And to that end, we definitely do need to be informed, but many predictions were ignored and even debunked by media before the catastrophe. If we allow media and entertainment and government to tell us what to eat and how to eat we are just Guinea pigs waiting to become part of a statistic. This film is not meant to be informational, it is mearly meant to point fingers at the government and to unfairly spotlight certain individuals who arent necessarily the main problem. You would have to watch every documentary on food that Netflix has and then some to try to really understand the entirety of our food wheel and how free enterprise in America has become the freedom to view consumers as a commodity. This is a government that allows for a certain number of fatalities to be ignored in crash ratings. America, as a country, is still the safest country to live in. But if we keep handing our well being over to the government to ensure, we are just asking to be lied to. We need to teach our children that free marketing means Let the Buyer Beware. Currently, weve become a nation who thinks that if its for sale it must be ok. Whiney snowphlakes are trying to force the government to take over their own common sense expectations like a pudgey toddler screaming for cake. The answer is stop shoving cake in your mouth. Packaged and fast foods have dumbed down society. How far are we willing to let this lethargic brain dead majority use our government for their personal expectations?

She is more bought than the majority of lawmakers. 18 terms and zero impact on anything. Next time, get a credible person. Just another scare tactic ""documentary"" by Netflix.

17,3,"Let's rename it to ""USA's meat Industry's Reality""",smgw7,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is very specific about few companies of America who produce Meat and Egg. Where 175 chicken (51:20 timestamp) meat is produced in a minute. At 16:10 a lady claims that manytimes meat of 400 animals are grinded together to create hamburger.Leave the rest things aside I'm amazed by these numbers. The first case was where some babies became ill because of eating ""hamburger"". Forget about the contaminated beef of that burger, HOW CAN YOU FEED A BABY BEEF-HAMBURGER!!!!!I come from a society where we rarely consume meat, If we do then it is home made and meat is purchased from the local butcher. And I can not think to eat packaged meat in my life, that feels unnatural. So I think the problem is in the culture where overconsumption of meat, specially processed and packaged meat is the problem.To me it felt like I'm watching kids burning their own finger then blaming the flame. Is it that hard to quit eating junk?",False

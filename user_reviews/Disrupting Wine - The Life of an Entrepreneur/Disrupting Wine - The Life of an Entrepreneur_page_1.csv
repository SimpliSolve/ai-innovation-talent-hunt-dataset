1,9,Disrupting more than wine.....,williamgway,n/a,15/08/2025,"Good doc. Fascinating look at the life an entrepreneur and the impacts on his family. The single focus of the entrepreneur leaves family priorities a distant second. At one point he is asked the question ""are you a good father"" and he says he will have to wait 20 years....and that says it all...business success over family success. I really enjoyed this aspect of understanding drive. Near the end of the doc he steps back from day to day running of the business and almost seems lost trying to find the next thing....look forward to the sequel and following up with his family. I enjoyed this well shot and well told story of success and the impact on those close to you. What is really success?",False
2,8,Who doesn't want to know more about wine?,lindapalmer,n/a,15/08/2025,Nicely done doc about the dream of starting a wine app business and the sacrifices that come with it. Great look at entrepreneurship!,False
3,9,HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,allison91,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a fantastic documentary that gets to the heart of how to start a business and the sacrifices required. The film doesn't shy away from using some candid moments that aren't ""perfect"" but perfectly imperfect. These moments add to the message of the film that life is tricky and messy, but you have to keep moving forward. Highly, highly recommend!",False
4,10,A must watch for startup dreamers,ECreviews,n/a,15/08/2025,"An excellent doc revolving around the life of a startup founder in his quest to create the perfect wine app. I'm not much of a wine drinker, although after watching I did download the app to check it out.This documentary is not necessarily for the wine connoisseur as it will not teach you anything about wine. The real story here is the about the complicated life of Heini, the startup founder, and the trials and tribulations his passion has caused for his family. In a lot of ways it is a cautionary tale for those dreaming of founding their own startup. None of the youtube videos or books deal with the interpersonal struggles that come along with creating an international business from scratch. This film does, and it will make you think. Success always comes at a cost.Stylistically excellent, well directed, shot beautifully and perfectly paced. If you have ever even considered getting your own business off the ground, let alone a tech startup, this is an absolute must watch.",False
5,10,More startup than wine doc,Ink789,n/a,15/08/2025,Fast paced and interesting. More focused on the startup/entrepreneurial aspect than the wine FYI,False
6,3,"A story about a boring ""entrepreneur""",michael1000,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerA poorly cobbled together doc. It's mainly about the self centered founder and his family who he pretty much neglected until recently. The doc really doesn't have a plot or any type of ending. They should wait to see if the company actually goes somewhere before touting this a success.,True
7,10,A Personal Documentary,JGReviews,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was never really much of a wine drinker until the last few years. When I saw this title pop up on Amazon, I decided to give it a watch and make it fun by pairing it with a cabernet. What this documentary showed me was a much more personal story than just one about wine or a wine app. Disrupting Wine follows Heini Zachariassen who is the creator of Vivino, which became the world's biggest wine app, but the story is much more about his life and family. Zachariassen had to make some difficult choices along the way and he delves into how disruptive it can be to uproot your family and move them to another continent in order to pursue the success of your business. Heini had children and the youngest did not even speak English at the time of the move to San Francisco. I found this all very interesting as a parent who is dealing with work/life balance issues myself. Definitely a very intriguing look behind the scenes.",False
8,2,Waste of time,jkgeriksson,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerAgree with review from Michael1000.. echo every single word.This is 45 minutes I'll never get back if my life. No storyline and only about a self centered guy who has a dull story. Poorly directed and low budget.,True
9,10,Fascinating look inside entrepreneurship! Definitely worthwhile viewing,sallproductionspdx,n/a,15/08/2025,"There's a lot of online content about entrepreneurship, but a shortage of documentaries (I say that as someone who made one). If you're interested in being an entrepreneur, are one, or are just interested in what goes into building a successful modern business, this a great watch. A little surprised I haven't heard more about it in online entrepreneurship circles and really hope that changes. This very well-made film deserves it!",False
10,8,The life of an entrepreneur and the cost it has on its family.,evelyne-8,n/a,15/08/2025,"Disrupting Wine is an interesting look at Heini an entrepreneur and his desire to follow his dreams without regret. In this case, building an app to help choose the right wine. While the film was very well shot and interesting to those who want to start something new, it only touched upon the difficulties that could arise. Heini uprooted his family and life for one's own desires. I wish it went deeper into the struggles or creating his dream and the struggles his family, felt uprooted but it did not. For those wanting to see someone go after something, you will enjoy this film.",False
11,9,Loved it!,craigahrens,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a terrific film and then some! I enjoy wine but by no means am I an expert nor my wife. What came through to me loud and clear is a person following their passion. Following their dream and to go for it! That for me is what stood out in this gem of a documentary. I liked the look of this film too, the pacing and I learned a good amount too. A topic on the surface, wine, I though could drag but it never did. Bravo to the director on this one! So for me, this one gets a solid thumbs up!!",False
12,9,A good drop!,gpigville,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a great doco that explores the life of entrepreneur Heini Zachariassen and the invention of his Wine app Vivino. But the doco is so much more, it explores his relationships with his family and the cost of balancing your personal life with an incredibly driven professional business venture. What is the personal cost of having that drive to be an entrepreneur and succeed? What does it take to be a success? This is a fascinating doc that is well worth a watch.",False
13,9,terrific doc. Merlot please!,beemtoaustin,n/a,15/08/2025,"This really fine documentary takes us to beautiful Denmark where we meet Vivino app creator Heini Zachariassen and his remarkable family as they embark on a life changing journey to the USA. It's all about wine, but more importantly it's about family and creativity and the power to turn ones dreams into reality. A truly insightful look at life itself, how to live it to the fullest and never look back. Highly recommended",False

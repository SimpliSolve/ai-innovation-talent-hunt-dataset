These intelligent and brave young women embark on what is usually a male dominated space, even in our own country and around the world. Being in Afghanistan in 2017, they broke the glass ceiling and were motivated to keep dreaming and succeeding for other women in their country and for the advancement of science in their country. The atrocities that occurred and are occurring are certainly massive hurdles for them and all women there, but they continue to dream and try to make inroads. This is a must see for all who want to truly get to know the essence of Afghan women.",True

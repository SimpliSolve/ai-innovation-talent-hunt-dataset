1,8,Money always ruins everything,Agent10,n/a,16/08/2025,"Growing up without cable television, the people I gravitated to were Bob Ross, Mr. Rogers, Levar Burton, Mr. Wizard and Alex Trebek. I don't regret not growing up with the wild variety of cable networks, for I can consider myself an OG when it comes to the media that so many people only wish they had been able to follow. The Mr. Rogers memes are especially hilarious to me considering I avidly watched his show.Either way, Bob Ross was the unusual noise in the background who somehow made cool paintings in less than half an hour. I have never been much of an artist so I always loved how he was capable of such things so quickly. I have fond remembrance of the man, and for the longest time I just wanted it to stay that way.Of course, the modern era with its thousands of channels and shows eventually had to come around and talk about the world of Bob Ross. I mean, we already broke down all of the other stalwarts of my youth, so now it was his turn. I was expecting the worst, but thankfully his only real vice was he seemed to like the ladies too much, which in all honesty is forgivable as long as he isn't outright assaulting them. However, the real tragedy is the story is the twisted and painful aftermath of his death.Turns out the likeness of Bob Ross was a fierce and ugly battle. One thing the modern era has taught us is with the commodification of everything is that if we are not careful, we may not even own the intellectual rights to our own name!! Now this sounds utterly ridiculous, but this is what happened to Ross' family when a scrupulous family member signed a very unfriendly contract that pretty much gave the likeness of Ross away to a third party. This basically means all of the board games, t-shirts and even coffee mugs are not even being licensed by the family. Heck, the paints that bear his name on them are not even being made by the company Bob originally picked to distribute.The result is a sad tale of making sure you have all your ducks in a row after death. While it was completely one sided affair, judging by the amount of products and fear that many people displayed in the making of this documentary, its pretty clear this was a highway robbery. Without the other side participating, we can't get a full picture of the story. But its pretty clear who is the wrong side. Either way, watch the film and enjoy the funny old photos of Bob, and then prepare to be sad. That seems to come in spades these days.",False
2,7,The ups and downs of a great man and painter,thomasheaney,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have followed his extensive work for some time now (since 2014), whilst I never got to enjoy the experience of a new episode, I know he brought inspiration and joy to generations he wouldn't have ever expected to know his work.I found this documentary hard to watch at points, whilst he had his flaws like most people, even when he was beaten by life, he tried to bring joy to others. It was shameful what was done before and after his death by those around him.If you like or care about Bob Ross at all then this is definitely worth a watch. It is pretty slow in places, but it is all part of the story.",False
3,6,Why was the most important basically ignored?,maarten_vis,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe fact that Bob's half brother gave all the name rights to the Kowalskis is basically the key to the story here. Yet it is just briefly mentioned. Nothing on his motives, or the amount of money he received. He was 51% shareholder, with Steve owning the other 49%. Then how is it possible Steve never received anything?This made the whole thing feel very incomplete.",True
4,7,But where are ALL the paintings?,KittyWitty917,n/a,16/08/2025,"Steve never discusses where the paintings are. Is he afraid of being sued too? I've read that's the big disappointment in his life, besides his dad dying, and it's never discussed. That part of the story was gigantically overlooked.",False
5,7,Over-long and drawn out,suego-49293,n/a,16/08/2025,"Honestly? I love Bob Ross, but this was slow and tedious. They really dragged out what cold have been told in half the time. It starts out as a retrospect on Bob's early life and career - good enough. But you know something bad is coming so it hinders your ability to fully enjoy that aspect. In the end and after all the build-up there isn't much of a bomb shell here, just a story as old as time itself. Greed on the part of those who took advantage of someone who was not business savvy. Sad and very unfortunate to be sure. It breaks my heart that someone as kind and giving as Bob was so severely used and taken advantage of. I guess the takeaway for me is, we all need to never buy a Bob Ross product of any kind again to stop putting money in the pockets of those he seemed to never want to have control over his name in the first place.",False
6,10,Bob Ross Inc. will not like this review,Samba-boy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sometimes, there are documentaries that just get about everything right. The research on this one is so well done and the situations that are talked about in the documentary are happening as we watch it, so much that you can't deny there is something fishy going on. I loved watching the 'Joy of Painting with Bob Ross'-shows as much as anyone else, but I never fully understood the current operations by 'Bob Ross Inc', and all the irrelevant or subpar 'crap' they are selling nowadays with the Bob Ross-name slapped on it. Watch this documentary and find out how one couple called the Kowalski's succeeded in actually robbing a man's name while on his deathbed. It's sad, really. They did Steve dirty.",False
7,6,Certainly Not A Happy Little Accident,neiljones1981,n/a,16/08/2025,"The new Netflix documentary on Bob Ross landed recently, and upon viewing comes across as being a little bit dry and revealing little that we didn't already know about the man.The Joy of Painting ran for over 30 seasons - 400 episodes - in the 1980s and 1990s, although most of them were back to back. The show ended in 1995 after the passing of Bob Ross.The problem with the documentary format is you have to have an interesting subject to start with, and if its about a person, there has to be some form of ""twist"" that crops up. The Bob Ross story basically boils down to former military man starts painting on TV in a whispering style, becomes effectively an institution and the legacy after he passes remains.While the legacy does remain, its not uncommon unfortunately for deceased famous people (or their estates) to become embroiled in problems years after their passing so I'm not entirely sure what the ""twist"" is here.The documentary is interesting for some back story on Ross and the Joy of Painting series, but beyond that, you're left with the impression from the documentary that there's a story that has to remain untold.",False
8,10,"Hard to watch, but you should!",countsn-78124,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's hard to think that anyone would want to take advantage of a man as kind as Bob Ross. I hope the people who did him wrong are shamed into doing the right thing. I say shame because we know they won't do the right thing on their own accord. If I were a part of the Kowalski family or Bob Ross, inc I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. Shameful! Greedy! Monsters!",False
9,7,How to build an empire with someone else's name?,fajarsantoso,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary shows what was truly going on in the life of the late Bob Ross and how a smart and manipulative family was able to convince a not-so-smart family to give up the rights of the empire that was build with the Ross brand.Interesting documentary but a bit too long for me.,False
10,10,Unreal...,Analog_Devotee,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredible documentary. I would watch Bob Ross all the time when I was a young man, and eventually as an adult I'd tune in at night to help me fall asleep. He was so soft-spoken and kind, you couldn't help but be pulled into his show and comforted.Though delving into interesting people's lives occasionally becomes quite the obsession for me (I love reading and watching biographies), I'd somehow never looked into Ross's life. All I knew for years and years was that he was an ex-military man who somehow ended up painting on television. I never felt like I needed to know more. We all have our trials and tribulations through life, absolutely, but Ross radiated this palpable sense of peace. It was even infectious. I think a lot of us just naively assumed that this guy's life was perfect; he had a true passion for something, and excelled in its field to a near-envious degree.You'll feel just about every emotional reaction under the sun when watching this. You'll revel in his success and generosity, cry when things go wrong, and become furious when the ""Betrayal & Greed"" from the title make themselves known.I hope the Kowalski's get their comeuppance one day. And I'm glad Steve, Bob's son, was able to find peace in the canvas.",False
11,7,Pleasant and informative yet not particularly daring,guskeller,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like many documentaries about universally loved figures, Bob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal and Greed is pleasant and informative without being particularly daring. Viewers will learn some juicy bits about Ross' personal life and there is light artistic expression in the film, yet overall, the documentary feels rather safe. The stylistic feel is gentle and warm, much like Bob Ross himself, which can't be faulted since it is very fitting. However, the film lacks a distinct vision that would make it truly memorable.The story has drama as it gets into the ugly posthumous battle for the rights to Bob Ross' name and image. We get to see plenty of emotion out of Bob's son, Steve Ross, as he discusses past frictions with his father, mourning his father's death, and engaging in said legal battles. Furthermore, the editing of the documentary is energetic enough to counter the dry nature of documentaries. Still, the film is lacking the artistic or emotional bite that leaves lasting impressions. So, while there are definitely small treasures to get from this movie, Bob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal and Greed will likely be mildly enjoyed and largely forgotten by most viewers.* Writing: 6/10

12,5,"Bob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal and Greed",henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDocumentary looking at the phenomenal success across the World of Bob Ross, his particular method of painting and how it helped so many people. Unfortunately his business partners have exploited this, turned it into a multi million dollar business and have kept everything - and contrary to Bob Ross' wishes, his son has received nothing,As a piece of filmmaking this is ok, featuring stock footage of Steve, but some interesting interviews with those affected by the tragedy. Sadly and inevitably neither the Kowalskis who took over everything against his wishes or Ross' brother who secretively signed everything over to the Kowalskis would appear. It ultimately demonstrates both the betrayal and greed the title suggests and really the legal system which allowed the bad guys to win.",True
13,6,I love Bob Ross but not this documentary,zmawa,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerFirst of all it was lengthy. The intro starts with ominous bg music when nothing ominous is happening.! The creator wanted to build emotions in audience around different events which was not executed nicely. Only the last portion you get to know about betrayal. But anyone could feel it was happening before Bob Ross died. It would be a great thing if they could also show us that. From a audience perspective I had a high hope from this documentary.,True
14,7,The Joy of a good documentary,Quinoa1984,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some of the details around the most recent lawsuit become a bit too murky and the lack of more people who were affiliated with or worked with or just knew the Kowalskis not coming forward ultimately makes the documentary lopsided. But the core of this story is an emotional one and how Ross came to his start going around and teaching painting and the prominence and popularity of the show and in particular the son Steve Ross and his own tragic path is affecting and captivating.I think Ross himself (Bob, I mean) is a soothing kind of Total Human Presence so to speak - a cool moment that I didn't think of as one of his collaborators brings up is how he knew his voice would be soothing as a contrast to another artist he saw on TV, but moreover that it would be good for women who were his primary demo (though they had a uh liking for him more than he expected) - and I'm sure it's no accident he like Mr Rogers was on PBS for much of his public life (and an interesting irony the movie doesn't seem to grapple with is how he was on public broadcast but the people around him had no compunction selling out as soon and fast as they could).If it may leave out points that a film with more access to subjects could get to, even to let people hang themselves out to dry (ie like the Woodstock 99 doc a month ago), it leaves one with a picture of a largely uncomplicated and sensitive man who fell in with some... Capitalists, and everything that goes with them. Whether they are good or bad ones is left up to the audience to decide.",False
15,7,A Bittersweet Story,nebohr,n/a,16/08/2025,"My mom used to watch Bob Ross on PBS and she had painted 42 very nice paintings with his tutelage. It's unfortunate that Bob was so naive about business and partnerships. Also, as others have mentioned, the documentary ran out of steam long before it ended.",False
16,10,Evil is everywhere,rws_20,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great documentary that brings to light the evil that stood behind the camera in that Bob Ross studio.I really feel for Bob and his son Steve, the greed of man really meets no end; there are slimey little money grabbers everywhere you look, even in the proverbial sanctuary where Bob created many of his beautiful works of art.Bob Ross Inc needs to be boycotted with immediate effect, this has been going on for far too long, it's just a shame the world didn't know sooner.",False
17,6,"Bob Ross documentary intrigues, then fizzles away",paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Bob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal & Greed"" (2021 release; 92 min) opens, we see footage of Bob Ross appearing on the Regis & Kathy Lee talk show in the early 90s, at what seems to be the peak of Ross' career. We then are introduced to Steve Ross, Bob's son, as Steve starts talking about his dad. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is directed by Joshua Rofe (""Sasquatch""). Here he reassesses the legacy of Bob Ross, who became a star while hosting ""The Joy of Painting"" on PBS between 1983 and 1994. We get a primer of Ross' upbringing and how he became a painter. The documentary then turns to the infighting after Bob Ross passes away in 1995 between the Kowalski couple (who cofounded Bob Ross Inc. With Bob) and Steve. The fact that the Kowalskis do not participate at all in this documentary, and of course that Bob Ross died all those years ago, almost sinks the documentary. Om top of that, we are told that many people close to Bob Ross did not want to participate either (apparently for fear of retribution by the Kowalskis). This leaves us with Steve and a couple of Bob's friends who dared to speak out. It felt to me as though we are not getting the full picture here. In that sense, the documentary feels incomplete. Please note that this documentary is co-produced by Melissa McCarthy, yes THE Melissa McCarthy (and apparently a massive fan of Bob Ross).""Bob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal & Greed"" premiered on Netflix in summer of 2021 (at the peak of COVID), and somehow I missed it... until now! If you are a fan of Bob Ross, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
18,9,Must watch!,Lizyeliz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary will make you smile, cry, MAD and even love Bob Ross more than you already did. It was especially painful to watch the injustice that has been done to Bob Ross and his son Steve Ross by Walt and Annette Kowalski. It will infuriate you when you know the details. I really hope justice will take place and they will be punished!(And the 2 negative reviews are obviously from evil team Kowalski).",False
19,7,"Could have been better, but still interesting",rajitecture,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie would have been better if it stayed focused on the Bob Ross life, TV show, and joy he brought. The whole lawsuit and Kowalski back-story wasn't very helpful to the entertainment value. The movie also spends too much time on the son. I say it should have focused on Bob. Bob really had an effect on people. I think him for the joy he brought me as I enjoyed his programs.",False
20,10,Great,big_asapper,n/a,16/08/2025,I hate documentaries but this one was so good. I'm never buying anything from bri. KowAlskis are awful people.,False
21,7,Hard to watch,Milu1982,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI always loved to watch Bob Ross paint. He was always so calm and yet excited about his art. And his voice was very soothing.So if course I had to watch this.Great to hear about Bob as a person from his son and his friends. And I love that is son also paints. I didn't know that.But the whole backstory breaks my heart. There is always someone greedy who doesn't want anything other than money. Bob didn't deserve that. His name doesn't deserve that! And neither does his son. It's heartbreaking to hear this story.They should've talked more about the brother who gave away the rights to Bob's name!!,True
22,5,Nothing here you can't find on Wikipedia,superfox_888,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is 90 minutes. For the first 60 minutes, the viewer is taken through Bob's life and career with an alleged affair between him and Annette Kowalski. For the final 30 minutes, it very much feels like we-can't-say-too-much-or-the-Kowalskis-will-sue-us.This leaves the entire doco feeling pointless and unnecessary. Several times it's pointed out that people declined to be interviewed for fear of legal repercussions; had those people agreed to speak on camera, this would have been a very different experience. As it stands, I was left wondering what the point of it was. The ""betrayal and greed"" promised in the title is vague at best, with more info included on Bob's Wikipedia page than the documentary.If you're a fan, watch it. If you've never heard of him but are intrigued by Netflix's ""we can't show you this trailer"" advertising, give it a miss.",False
23,9,Steve Ross deserves better,materialgworrrl,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bob loved to make people feel happy and he wanted that to be his legacy. He also wanted his son to not have to worry about money in life. Its that simple.This was a great watch and really struck me how greedy people are. How far they are willing to go in order to make money. Is so gross and disgusting and i would think, against everything Bob taught.If you watch this and come out thinking that Steve Ross does not deserve any part of his father legacy, you are wrong.Do what makes you happy as long as it doesn't hurt anyone. Enjoy life, take up painting.Thank you Bob, Steve, Dana and all the others who have re-ignited the the joy of painting in many people like myself.",False
24,10,Don't Buy That Bob Ross Shirt at Spencer's,stefstars,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI learned a lot about this beloved man who painted gorgeous nature scenes every week on public television. I'm very happy that his son and close friends have revealed this story to the whole world and I hope it continues to open the public's eyes. I always had a bad feeling when I saw Bob Ross merchandise being sold in stores, but the merchandise doesn't match Bob Ross in any way. It's designed with contemporary sayings or it's something gimmicky like Bob Ross mints, bobble head, etc. These things, to me, didn't correlate with the soft spoken man who was always uplifting people on TV and just seemed like a simple man. Before watching this documentary I thought maybe the family was milking him as much possible but never imagined that he was practically stolen from his son by some greedy folks and sold by a greedy half brother. So sad that this happened to Bob Ross.I think the inclusion of Bob's possible affair with Annette Kowalski was great, not for the sensational aspect of it but because it humanizes Bob Ross. Just because someone is beloved doesn't mean they're free of imperfections - however this possible affair was not a happy accident, just a plain old mistake. His whole connection with the Kowalskis, although life changing, was a big mistake for him. The Kowalskis can deny everything and sue everyone to high heaven, but the fact that a bunch of people didn't speak for fear of retaliation says a whole lot more than anything they could make up to clean up their greedy image. Bob Ross wasn't perfect and it's unhealthy to promote him or any other public figure as such, but his laidback, warm nature is what makes him lovable - along with that wonderful painting talent. Case in point with the people they show at the end who are grateful to Bob Ross for saving them from the depths of depression.I'm glad the Jenkins couple came out and told their story. I would not know about these people otherwise and it's awful that their disappearance from the public eye is because of the Kowalskis. You see that Bob Ross even promoted them on his show while alive, so it's cruel that their livelihood was stolen from them by a company under Bob Ross' name. That being said, I think this is overall a great documentary. Both sides of the story are presented, but it's not hard to see who's at fault here. I see some of the complaints from other users is that the documentary used stocked footage rather than rare, never before seen footage or whatever. For me, I don't think that matters. What mattered is that they presented the real story about this man. All the good and the bad. Most importantly they exposed the greedy people who continue to exploit him. The music selection matches Ross' energy perfectly, the color scheme, and the impressionist paintings used to show some of the behind the scenes key moments at The Kowalski home.The team behind this documentary really did their research, not just on the story they're trying to present but on the type of art Bob Ross did and how seedy business contracts worked. It's a great documentary and I think the team should be properly congratulated and recognized for their hard work. They did Bob Ross justice and created a proper documentary.I highly recommend this documentary. My admiration for Bob Ross has not changed. He was human and I'm not gonna fault him for being human. You should definitely before buying that ""trendy"" shirt with Bob Ross' face at Spencers or Hot Topic or Forever 21. You'll just be making The Kowalski's pockets fatter, they don't deserve it. Don't buy that gimmicky trash merchandise, do it for Bob !",True

1,5,"Typical Dinesh D'Souza film, you'll either like or hate it",zennith,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dinesh D'Souza has done it again. He's made another political film that will be loved by some and hated (and completely ignored) by others. It has his typical formula of mixing fact and what some might think is questionable information, wrapped up in a sensationalized story. The few movies I've seen of his do peek my interest even though I often wonder where is the proof. I do believe some of what he says is true and others I question mainly because they are so controversial. Since he doesn't prove his story beyond all doubt then it is hard to buy it all hook line and sinker. Since there will always be people who debunk or deny the validity of his facts he is always doubted. So, I take a wait and see approach. I hope future historians will shed light on the events of the last 20 some years with a less biased eye on both sides. However, even that I'm not wholly confident will ever happen. So...I wait and see. This film focused on Trump, mostly since 2015 to present, but there are a few references to before then. Unfortunately, I only heard things I already knew. There wasn't definitive proof offered. Even though I believe a lot of it I don't see anyone who doesn't believe these facts to be swayed at all. The storytelling format was ""factual history"" dramatized, as most of his other movies do, so it comes off as rather corny. In between the drama Dinesh acts as narrator and interviewer. There were some funny parts where I and others in the theater laughed. Since I already knew the information covered it did seem long. Probably won't see it again. Can't say I'll recommend it much because I know most people won't believe it and Dinesh can be polarizing. You either think he is a good investigator, historian and interviewer or you don't.",False
2,1,Isn't lying one of the Commandments thou shall not break?,Solnichka,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a lifelong educator, historian, and journalist, i occupy a world of.common sense, ethics, facts, law, logic, math, morality, rationality, reason, and science in my critical-thinking processes on what constitutes the real world around me. This moviemaker does not live in my world; he lives in some fantasy land where he can make up anything that makes him happy, get someone else to pay for the equipment, and then present it to an audience who wants to hear the same kind of ""truths"" that have no basis in common sense, ethics, facts, law, logic, math, morality, rationality, reason, or science. When 75 percent of modern Americans lack critical-thinking skills, this kind of ""art"" is what happens. Americans have a choice: enlightened citizenry as the Founding Fathers intended, or ...willful ignorance in a reality-distortion zone created of their own cognitive dissonance. This attempt at a film falls into the latter category-especially when one realizes the moviemaker was a convicted felon, pardoned by his subject. Common sense would have any rational thinker automatically reject such an attempt at moviemaking due to subjectivity and implicit bias. History and posterity is already laughing at this moviemaker.",False
3,10,An awesome movie,gcic,n/a,16/08/2025,Of course you have the those trying to drive the ratings down on this movie because of TDS and that just adds to the commentary of what this movie is all about. This movie gives a clear picture of how much President Trump really cares about this country try and how many powerful resources are constantly coming at him. This is a movie about a man who just wants to have an America our founding fathers worked for. Of course people haven't heard of this movie because the media doesn't want people to get a real look at the type of person he is and how much he really cares for our country. A must see.,False
4,9,Still Worth Fighting For Your Country,nlathy-839-300677,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a movie well worth seeing with the Election drawing near. Dinesh D'Souza has made a movie, which tops the previous three. The use of actors to help tell the story of the Establishment's crackdown on the American people improves pacing. Casting Nick Searcy as a Democrat operative is a stroke of brilliance. The movie's dark humor is a welcome surprise. Some things could have been done better. John Wayne makes for a better Western hero than Clint Eastwood. There could have been some discussion about how deep state will be dealt with if Trump regains White House. Still an amazing film. Stay past the beginning of the closing credits.",False
5,10,An outstanding achievement in documentary filmmaking.,alexander-e-bloch,n/a,16/08/2025,"To characterize Vindicating Trump as a documentary would be a disservice to potential audience. The film does portray a factual story about real people and events, but it unfolds like a non-fiction novel, allowing director Dinesh D'Souza to convey perspectives that are largely absent from mainstream media coverage.The effectiveness of the narrative clearly demonstrates that D'Souza seized the mastery of the film medium by skillfully combining archival footage with dramatic reenactments, using tight pacing, moving soundtrack, and emotional cues to create a visceral narrative that challenges entrenched preconceptions. It is evident that the Director has a pretty good sense that a well-constructed footage can transcend the barriers of chronological, cultural, intellectual, and ideological boundaries as it instantly cuts to the core of the matter at a visceral, rather than cognitive level, prompting a reappraisal of one's values.At the risk of digressing for a moment, I feel compelled to share some of the decades-old memories that Vindicating Trump unexpectedly brought to the forefront of my psyche. Growing up in Odessa, Ukraine during the Soviet era, my first movie experience occurred at age five when my father took me to see Battleship Potemkin - a 1925 silent Russian epic - also a non-fiction novel format - about a revolt aboard a battleship by the sailors (lower classes) against the ship's officers (the elites). The scene of the Odessa Steps massacre, including the baby carriage teetering on the edge of one of the steps, was permanently etched in my brain. The significance of the events taking place on these very steps I personally walked on nearly every day was lost on me at the time (a five-year-old's frame of reference and sense of proportion are rather limited). What wasn't lost on me was the fact that despite the 30-year age difference, both my father and I seemed equally affected by the disturbing sequence that follows the pram with the above-mentioned baby rolling down the steps amidst the bloody carnage. What the Vindicating Trump creators proved again is that a well-constructed footage can transcend the barriers of chronological, cultural, intellectual, and ideological boundaries as it instantly cuts to the core of the matter at a visceral, rather than cognitive level. It is no surprise therefore that Dinesh D'Souza chose the film media to tackle the entrenched Trump derangement syndrome and tell the story in a way that challenges the entrenched biases.D'Souza's storytelling talent led me to explore more about the man behind the work. Unsurprisingly, Dinesh D'Souza is a true Renaissance figure-a prolific author, public speaker, debater, and filmmaker. His boldness stands out, especially in taking on figures like Obama and Hillary Clinton in ways few have dared. On top of that, he manages to host a daily, hour-long podcast where he delves into key political issues, interviews relevant guests, and, unexpectedly, offers insightful book reviews. (It seems Dinesh accomplishes more before breakfast than I do in a week!)Moving forward, I'm eager to dive into his earlier books and films. Based on his impressive body of work, I wouldn't be surprised if D'Souza is eventually recognized as one of the more consequential intellectuals of our time, alongside thinkers like Thomas Sowell and Victor Davis Hanson.",False
6,7,Not for Trump Haters,JMLinLA,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust came back from the movie theater to see the documentary and, to be honest, I liked it, but nothing memorable. I say that because since I am an avid news watcher, I kind knew most of it. To those who gave 1 star, you have not seen the movie but are simply trying to lower the rating to discourage people from seeing it. It's a sad thing to do. Anyhow, the movie is well presented and, knowing Dinesh D'Souza being a great investigator and researcher, you will enjoy it. Now, here is the spoiler, I was shocked to learn that the election results could be so easily manipulated or influenced if you are well organized and intended. I am not saying it had happened or that it will happen and who could do it. Just something to think about.",True
7,10,"How Democrats persecute him, steal elections, and Kamala's policies",geraldrdolan,n/a,16/08/2025,"This should be required watch for every voting age American citizen. Learn about the man and grandfather, how he sacrifices his wealth and freedom to help us citizens and the country. Learn how Democrats and their media demonize him. Learn how Democrats weaponized and corrupted the justice system to attack him, silence him, bankrupt him, and try to put him in prison. Learn undercover how the Democrats cheat to steal elections, how they buy and manufacture fraudulent and illegal mailed and drop box ballots, and ruin the integrity of our election system. Learn about Kamala Harris policies that would destroy our economy and our country.",False
8,9,Pulling back the veil,barbdreger,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tough to watch at times, due to the reality of the corruption and devisiveness we're seeing in our country. This documentary by Dinesh was well produced and included behind the scenes footage and information to give the viewer a clearer picture of what is happening with our elections and politics. Much actual footage was used to illustrate the corruption and frankly it was shocking to learn that anyone can order ballots to be printed and submitted. The only one who would think this was acceptable would be someone who wants to control the election outcome, vs respect the voice of the people. It needs to be corrected. Corruption at so many levels...",False
9,9,Eye-opening and well worth seeing,woef-14329,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a former ""Never Trumper"" who is going to vote for Trump in 2024, I highly recommend seeing this movie. The most shocking part of it was the part about what is legal and possible in terms of fake ballots. Really shocking James O'Keefe-like footage showing what is possible in terms of cheating. This is so alarming. Without proper elections there is no hope for the world. Venezuela here we come. I am so sorry I misjudged Trump in the past. And I honestly do think that the West will fall unless we elect Trump and other republicans, aided by Democrats including Bobby, Tulsi, the Weinsteins and so many other good people who reject the insane leftist agenda of changing the rules of the game to create a one-party state (weaponising the Justice system, rigging the vote, riding roughshod over our constitutional rights like free speech and the second amendment), etc. I want a president who respects the constitution, rather than a tyrannical Maoist bent on destroying America. This film by Dinesh was excellent.",False
10,9,Worth every minute,yerlo,n/a,16/08/2025,"We really enjoyed this film as we do all of the D'Souza documentaries. He brings receipts. What made my jaw drop was just how insecure and easy to manipulate ballots. Was not ready to see how wide is the breach in the voting integrity wall. It's as wide open are our borders. We were riveted.I see the rating feature here has been hijacked to drive ratings out the bottom, but the actual user reviews are very very good and insightful. D'Souza never fails to deliver, to support his claims with facts to be seen with the eye.It's time to go back and see again his first documentary ""America: What would the world do Without Her"" to remember just why we fight so hard to keep her safe.",False
11,8,Portrait of a desperado,zoerobe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerEarly on ""Vindicating Trump,"" states an inconvenient truth: until 2015 when he announced he was running for President of the United States and descended an escalator to make a speech that only later was considered polarizing, Donald Trump was a well-liked guy, hobnobbing with celebrities and public figures who now publicly pretend they never had anything in common. If you were alive and kicking in the eighties, barring a convenient case of amnesia that quite a few have developed, many people admired Donald Trump and shared the view that ""greed is good."" (In my high school yearbook, more than a few seniors claimed their ambition was to make lots of money.) If you are resolutely anti-Trump and have decided he is evil personified, you may want to watch ""The Apprentice"" instead. If you believe Trump is a multi-faceted person who has done more than most people will in their lives, you may want to watch ""Vindicating Trump.""After a montage of Trump's pre-political days, the movie begins by invoking Abraham Lincoln, who was also reviled by the left, and who feared that one day, America could wind up in the hands of a dictator. The documentary by Dinesh DeSouza, who is no stranger to political persecution by the left, sets out to explore this question, using interviews with Trump himself and his daughter-in-law, Lara (who is co-chair of the RNC), dramatizations of what those trying to stop Trump are up to, and actual footage, including that fateful rally where Trump narrowly avoided assassination. It makes points that you may either find astute, if somewhat obvious, such as that if Trump is indeed literally Hitler, he appears to be jaw droppingly bad at dictating since he allowed the mainstream press to pillory him on a regular basis during his term and none of his detractors have wound up in jail, or easily dismissed. Also that a man who literally wrote ""The Art of the Comeback"" might just know a few things about coming through adversity. The last third is devoted to the possibility of upcoming election fraud, a familiar topic if you've seen ""2000 Mules,"" however, there are new angles brought up and discussed such as ""vouchering,"" and the ease of purchasing ballots. A powerful, absorbing film at least if you're a MAGA fan.",True
12,9,Truth beyond headlines,saeed-kaviani,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found Vindicating Trump to be a compelling and eye-opening documentary that offers a unique perspective on recent events. The filmmakers did an excellent job of gathering and presenting factual information that challenges popular narratives and encourages viewers to think critically. The documentary is well-researched, with solid interviews and commentary that bring depth and context to complex issues.It's refreshing to see a documentary that allows the viewer to question mainstream media coverage and understand the story from an angle often overlooked. The storytelling is engaging and maintains a balanced tone, making it accessible to viewers from all backgrounds. Overall, Vindicating Trump provides valuable insights and serves as a thought-provoking piece for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of recent political developments.""This kind of feedback keeps the tone positive, emphasizing the documentary's strengths in storytelling, research, and balanced perspective.",False
13,n/a,The irony of that one review written exactly a month before the election results or declaration is priceless.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This review is actually to point out the after election spin of a review written on oct the 6th. Just about one month before we knew which was the wind really blew.Now the best part is carefully reading the dated narratives and assertions about authority and quality of the individuals judgment or negative things like lying.Of course its rated a not at all unreasonable 1 out of 10.Heck if you want an idea of how much total bs is in the ratings read about weighted ratings methods and then look at any trump content and see the vast numbers of people so dumb they still almost exclusively vote 1 or 10 thinking thats the most effective way to toss partisan skewing in under the radar.Even the one 5 of 10 review that tries to paint itself as a review of reason. Still the deep bias is there plain to see.Most people won't like it. That along with plenty other tale tell signs as it progresses give way to the reality this is someone with fairly strong left anti trump bias role playing some sort of reasoned moderate.Much of the focus is to invalidate as ""the proof or evidence"" simply isn't there. Im sorry are there an excess of political content like this where the undeniable cited evidence and proof is always present? Like what things has he been watching and what standard does they think exists in such media?At any rate they almost have a point until their true and clearly purposefully masked bias comes creeping to the surface comforted that they are approaching their goal and its safe to reduce the effort before reaching it.Most of the political figures and presidents who have been assassinated or attempted tended to be actually at risk of accomplishing something.Its interesting to think about such things like the list of popular victims or survivors of assassins. How much promise they held for the future or threat to some.Also its important to note the kind of times general attitudes of the people and parties when no assassinations are occurring or failed attempts.You can't kill the truth but you can bury it alive.Now wonder about the sheer volume of noise and distraction and how quickly it has changed in nature and tone post win.Is that really because people or scared of revenge or some totalitarian regime coming for them in the future? Or is that simply a bunch of kids realizing the jig is up and mom has called them home for dinner.",False
14,8,Needs more back story to help viewers with context,bianaryabyss,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie will be appreciated by those with the background to understand it. The problem some have in grasping much of what's here is that few understand that we've reached an inflection point in history that's being poorly handled by government's around the world. The most dangerous ideas ever adopted by humanity with regard to the management of people are ""the ends justify the means"" and ""for the greater good"". We now live in a world where nearly 8,000,000,000 others live. A world where increasingly automation will replace humanity in the workplace, and where everyone wants a 2500 sq ft home two cars and a boat in the garage and a cheeseburger for dinner. Many nations want to join the nuclear community and the world is devoting more and more resources to security. In a world with finite resources it's been determined that they must be shared and at a level that's sustainable. A global standard of living, far below what has been enjoyed by my generation here in the US. In attempting to create this new future governments around the world have adopted the goal of breaking down borders and national cultures to reform the world with a single global culture. This effort has been underway in earnest for about 25 years. The drive for this new managed world is seen by proponents as the only way forward for mankind. Those that resist have seen the danger in the new managed society roughly outlined in everything from Logan's Run to The Hunger Games. The difficulty some have with the film is that it's a view through a toilet paper roll and thus difficult for them to connect with. What most people argue about is nonsense ginned up to divide. A quick analysis shows both sides to be correct. There will need to be some changes. Those changes cannot create a totalitarian system, nor a unified world government. The content of this movie is the case for that understanding.",False

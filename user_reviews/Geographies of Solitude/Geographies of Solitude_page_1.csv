1,10,The Silenced Shore,HollyB-0,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe 2022 documentary Geographies of Solitude follows Zoe Lucas, who has dedicated more than forty years to tracking and recording the life and death of the species who inhabit Sable Island, Nova Scotia and the ecosystem they utilize. The director and videographer, Jacquelyn Mills, follows Lucas throughout her daily discoveries, from invertebrates living in the horses' dung, to the sea glass and pearls that wash up onto the land. The captivating research covers birds, beetles, bees, seals, spiders and over five hundred wild horses who wander the secluded island, whose details are meticulously recorded through coordinates and spreadsheets that identity and separate each creature. In Geographies of Solitude, the ecology speaks louder than words, as a medium that allows Lucas to show audiences the extraordinary beauty and tranquility of Sable Island.The words ""All alone, all alone"" are type written in poetry and flashed on the screen to portray the seclusion from humans that Lucas endures. But she is not truly alone, she is surrounded by nature and a lively ecosystem that surrounds the island, shown in numerous glimpses of wind blowing in the long grass and waves crashing into each other. Like the horses, she is left in solitude, not loneliness. The sun catcher dangling in her window, made from the land's creations, adds rays of light into her cabin and reminds us of the interconnected relationship between nature and its inhabitants. As the light reflecting gives life to her home, she in return gives reciprocal love to the environment by caring for the island.The emotions of serenity and peace that are interwoven into the spirit of Sable Island are shown through Mills creative choices and aesthetics of the film. The natural and muted palette on screen evokes a stillness, a quietness that allows for contemplation about the earth. The whistling of the wind, crashing of waves, crowing of the birds, barking of the seals and footsteps in the sand are the soundtrack that carries us through the life on this land and generates a pure sense of solitude. The subtle narration leaves the audience to let nature speak for itself. The camera lens shoots through the grass onto its focus to situate our perspectives through the eyes of nature.This film is a remarkable and beautifully executed representation of the power of nature, and the power of humans impacts on nature. The connection that each life form has on one another is poetically shown through the decaying horses' body as a means of sustenance for the insects. Poetically, this documentary acts as sustenance for humanity, a must watch film, and acts as a clear reminder of the power of reciprocity to the earth and the consequences that nature pays for careless actions of environmental pollution. As Lucas shines a flashlight onto the horses in the dark, Geographies of Solitude shines a light on its viewers to see the majesty of the natural, uninterrupted world.""Because we're destroying the planet, that is our only home""

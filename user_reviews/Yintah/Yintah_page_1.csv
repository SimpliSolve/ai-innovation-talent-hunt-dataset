1,8,Another nail in the coffin of fossil fuels,citizen-caveman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Losing a battle ain't the same as losing a war.Dependence on fossil fuels comes at a very high social and enivornmental cost, for some at least, as this documentary proves.No evidence means no case.This documentary is very credible evidence against the case for dependence on fossil fuels.Given the rise of the alternatives, the cost for fossil fuels has become unacceptably high.Look at the bigger picture. Someone wasn't just fighting for their way of life, albeit inadvertently, they were also fighting for everyone else's future.Maybe someone lost a battle; they didn't lose the war.",False
2,10,Heartbreaking,Lamborghini_Mercy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary broke my heart. Seeing the force that a corporation has to destroy land without any regard of the people who live there has changed my way of thinking.This is a powerful documentary that is happening in real time. It is important to educate the world about how the land provides for us. An Elder said in the documentary that we do not own the land - we BELONG to the land and we are apart of it. That resonates within my soul. True words were spoken here.All of the true history and land is being erased. The people who had any part of removing and arresting the ingenious people from their land should be ashamed. Karma will greet you in the end.Greed and power is ruining this world and at the end of the day, WE ALL LOSE.",False
3,10,The RCMP used as a private militia by an oil and gas company to remove indigenous people and destroy their land and ancestral artefacts,craig_rea80,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAbsolutely maddening. The bravery of these indigenous people is awe-inspiring, having no choice but to face off against a gas company with armed police as their enforcers; unarmed and with little more than their war songs, they are bullied, assaulted, intimidated, ignored, harassed, and continually arrested for asserting their right to decide what happens to the land they belong to.The government, however, wants its lovely, lovely money, and will do whatever it takes to get it, including having fully armed tactical police pointed assault weapons at unarmed, peaceful people, and remove them from their land so they can destroy it and build pipelines on it.The RCMP and Trudeau come off as the lowest of scumbags here.",True
4,10,Enraging and inspiring,rozennrichardeau,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary worth watching it, even if you are not from Canada. This is about an international topic: the power relationship between huge oil and gas corporations and indigenous communities. It also delves in the traumatic topic of history of native Americans in Canada.It's beautifully shot in the wild nature of unceded territories or Yintah in western Canada. It shows the undefeatable and inspiring strengths of exceptional individuals who just ask go get the land where they belong.It brings tears and rage but also shows the amazing power of togetherness and what all can be achieved once people root for the same cause.",False
5,10,The True Canada,crimeagainstcreation,n/a,16/08/2025,"Canada - one of the best countries to live in - but for who? There is an endless number of dire examples to how the Canadians have mistreated the First Nation population over the generations. It is no better than what has been going on in the US, and in relation to the Canadian ostensible image as an environment friendly nation - think again. Oil is a big dirty and cruel business also in the planets second largest country, and the regards to the well being of indigenous peoples come very much second, if it is present at all. Yintah profiles the Wet-suwet-en First Nation, as they fight to protect their traditional lands from natural gas pipeline developments. The film has won or been nominated to at least seven awards, and just won the HUMAN Rights HUMAN Wrongs Main Award 2025, at this documentary festival in Oslo. In a wider issue it reflects the oil companies true concerns about the climate, nature and indigenous peoples, so watch the film on Netflix and give it your ratings here, and at other film communities. That's the least you can do.",False

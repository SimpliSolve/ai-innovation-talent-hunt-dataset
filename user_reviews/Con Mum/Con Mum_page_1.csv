1,7,Anticipating Being Scammed,benzito-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"In this gripping film, the intricacies of deception unfold as it reveals how the scammed were, in many ways, willing participants in their own downfall. The direction is sharp, effectively showcasing the receipts of their misplaced trust. One can only hope that the total amount lost pales in comparison to the film's production costs. The narrative cleverly highlights that those scammed were ultimately biding their time, anticipating a payoff upon her demise. While I don't condone scamming, this story serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating that sometimes, those seeking a quick gain get exactly what they deserve. A thought-provoking watch!",False
2,8,An above average con documentary,tobydale,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well. This is a toe-curlingly agonising watch!Con Mum is an above average con story documentary.A vulnerable man and his partner are expecting a baby, when an old woman comes into their lives seemingly out of nowhere. What unfolds is a story of mind-boggling amoral manipulation, greed and financial destruction. No spoilers.The power of this show comes from the honesty of the real-life protagonists in front of the cameras. All of them, except one. We really feel for those on the receiving end, especially and particularly the vulnerable man and his family. It's appalling to watch. Shredding. Chilling.Even so - we learn a whole lot about one of our human conditions: the need we have to want to believe. Once a scammer knows this vulnerability about us - they have us.... That's what's happened here in Con Mum.Recommended.",False
3,7,A sad and wretched tale of a scammer scamming her own son...,mdw0526,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAnother week, another documentary, and this one among the saddest and most wretched we've seen in a while. ""Con Mum"" on Netflix tells the story of a man, a star chef and seemingly decent guy, who gets scammed by his own mother. And not to belittle the victim, but... he made some truly questionable decisions along the way, including abandoning his partner and child in pursuit of a windfall he could barely imagine (and had no proof was even real). I wouldn't call him a hero, or even an anti-hero. In trying to heal his childhood wounds, he just passed that same trauma along to his son. Of course, it's easy to say ""take a step back and think"", but that's how manipulation and brainwashing work. It's how people fall for con artists, cults, and orange shitgibbon carnival barkers. If someone promises you something too good to be true, they're not going to improve your well-being in any way, shape, or form.",True
4,6,Average Con Documentary.,kenbo-87360,n/a,15/08/2025,"With all these con related documentaries you always find yourself saying 'how are people so gullible'. Well for the first 20/25 minutes the con seemed plausible, until we find out Netflix are holding back on some of the important information.The name of the show is a bit of a spoiler in itself. I won't be giving anything away by saying the 'Mum' is a con woman. The story is about how she dupes her 'son' 45 years after she gave birth to him and gave him away as a newborn.He thinks he's getting the dream reconciliation, where in fact it turns into a nightmare for him and his family.It's intriguing enough to keep you interested. You probably won't remember it in a years time.",False
5,6,"Your Story Moved Me Deeply, but Sorry Not Sorry About Your Indifference to Your Family",muratpsy-36145,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hi Graham,I recently watched Con Mum and felt compelled to reach out.First, I want to say how deeply sorry I am for everything you went through. The emotional and financial pain you endured is unimaginable, and it's clear you carried a heavy burden.That said, I can't help but feel disappointed by the way your relationship with your partner and son seemed sidelined. Throughout the documentary, it felt like your focus was so fixed on Dionne and the fantasy she spun that you overlooked the people who were truly there for you - your real family. She, too, belonged to your kitchen world, the place you sought refuge in, yet you forgot she was part of that very world that once gave you safety and support. To me, that felt like a painful form of indifference.Now, it's time to take responsibility and fight to bring your family back together. No more excuses - your partner and son deserve you to show up fully. Go after them, make amends, and rebuild what was lost before it's too late.Thank you for sharing your truth so openly. I wish you strength and courage as you face this challenge.Take care
(and remember - ""take care"" is not something your family owes you by default; it's something you must earn.)",False
6,7,Who doesn't like a good con?,kosmasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"Oh wait, they don't mean convention? Dang it - no pun intended of course. And all kidding aside - because this is serious stuff. As you can imagine (more than me I assume or if not before then now), this is about someone taking advantage of another human being.The constellation may be interesting and quite a few things had to go wrong (or right from her perspective) ... it's kind of crazy that people still fall for stuff like this. Mostly either someone gullible or someone who gets way over his (or her) head ... good people also mostly, so I am not trying to put anyone down here ... well done and really well edited. I assume some things have been re-recorded - other than that, really gripping if you let yourself immerse ... and go on this wild ride ... we're outside and can judge differently ... still you would hope some people would fight back more .. anyway let this be a warning!",False
7,6,VIEWS ON FILM review of Con Mum,burlesonjesse5,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler2025's Con Mum is a sad, factual film made only sadder by the fact that the black hat involved didn't get charged with any crime. I mean she could be wobbling around somewhere today, scamming the bejesus out of some poor schlub. Yikes.Anyway ""Mum"" is shot in the standard, docu form. It's film-making 101, a rinse, repeat of interviews and recent archives and present-day swipe, sterile and wonted and made for the TLC Network as opposed to the big screen.The victims in Con Mum, well they become pathetic, self-enablers. The ""mum"" in Con Mum, well she becomes as hated as any real-life character you could ever imagine. Now did I feel sympathy or commiseration for any fifteen minutes of fame-r involved here? No, just a bilious feeling in the pit of my stomach as I did the good old SMH. And does ""Mum's"" veteran helmer Nick Green provide a happy cessation and/or a fruition moment when those 88 minutes of running time are up? No, just a downer of a summing-up, where separation and false clean hands are involved.Containing a twist and taking place mainly in London (and just about everywhere else), Con Mum is about an 80-year-old woman who seeks out her actual, estranged son and his female partner and proceeds to diddle them out of nearly $500,000 US dollars (hence the twist). It's like that email you get from a kite that says, ""give me $20,000 and I'll get you $5 mil"" (yeah right). The mum in question is Dionne and the couple is Graham and Heather. ""I never stopped loving you. I just want to be with you as much as I can"". Yeah, whatevs Dionne.So yeah, remember that line from a certain Matt Damon flick from '98? You know where Matthew's Mike McDermott says, ""if you can't spot the sucker at your first half hour at the table, then you are the sucker"". Well that applies to Graham and Heather, two naive foodies that seemed to have been easily duped by a husky, ""Pat"" of a human being that's nearly bald, unable to move freely, and likes to completely butcher the English language. I don't know whether Con Mum is a cry for help for Graham and Heather or a route for them to make a profit off this documentary after being taken for a monetary ride. Either way ""Mum"" is a very uneven viewing experience. Def ""con"".",True
8,7,Greed gets in the way of suspicion,wisewebwoman,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerCon Mum tells the story of a desperately needy son being scammed by his birth mother who has thrown him away at birth and then, during Covid attempts to reconnect with him.All the red flags are there from the beginning. Her statements of vast wealth held up in foreign parts, her successful investments, her wealthy connections, her life style.It's a massive pyramid scheme of course, fleecing one poor sucker after another and the living the life of riley on the proceeds to convince the next sucker how wealthy she is.Add the needy son along the way when she's stuck without funds in London and needing a new dupe.He falls for her and the promise of millions coming his way and ""loans"" her money. Of course.Meanwhile his wife and brand new baby need his care and attention but he vanishes with New Mum to Switzerland to sign documents and bingo he's there for six months as one excuse after another is presented as to the non production of the documents.The price he pays is losing his wife and child and at least $100,000 dollars and of course, his mother gone with the wind that blew her into his life.And part of me feels the poor sucker deserved it cuddling up to one of the greatest con artists of all time.But seriously, this woman should have been in a legitimate business of some kind. I had to admire her brilliant thievery.7/10 Netflix.",True
9,9,It's a fascinating story.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Graham and Heather are excited about the imminent birth of their child, but their world it rocked, when Graham gets a message from Dionne,who claims to be his long lost mother, and a relative of The Sultan of Brunei, a woman who's apparently hugely wealthy. Dionne is quick to buy gifts for Graham and Heather, but bizarrely she's soon asking for money.It is a very well made and fascinating documentary, in this day and age where there isn't a single day where there isn't a story about some sort of scam or dodgy scheme, it seems so odd that it can still be happening, but it continues to happen.The way Dionne manipulated poor Graham was cruel, she really took advantage of that need in him to find love, to find a place of belonging. It took Graham some time to realise what was going on.I don't know why, but when I think of scammers, I think of attractive, younger people, I don't often think of old ladies, it just goes to show, you should never trust anyone on face value.It's so incredibly sad to learn that the couple split, they seemed so much in love, so happy, Graham man you should have gone to your wife and new born at Christmas, you can understand why Heather got so angry, mum or not.What an evil woman, Dionne has done nothing but take from Graham, from start to finish, karma, one can only hope.It's a fascinating watch.9/10.",False
10,n/a,"Another flimsy, one-sided Netflix fiction portraying itself as a ""documentary""",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNetflix's Con Mum (2025) recounts the story of Graham Hornigold, a British pastry chef who is contacted in 2020 by Dionne - an elderly woman claiming to be his long-lost mother. Presenting herself as a terminally ill high-net-worth individual linked to royalty, she establishes a relationship with him that is followed by financial outlays on his part, ultimately reaching several hundred thousand pounds. Con mum is yet another flimsy, one-sided Netflix fiction portraying itself as a ""documentary"". Hornigold - the biological son - and the other so-called ""victims"" are depicted uncritically, as the film fails to acknowledge the obvious motive behind their actions: greed. Hornigold's decision to leave his wife and newborn child for two months to be with Dionne casts his ""care"" in a revealing light - suggesting it was not solely motivated by filial devotion, but was at least in part a distinctly transactional form of attachment. As for the other dupes, whom Dionne referred to as her ""grandson"" and ""granddaughter"", they gave or lent her large sums of money, seemingly motivated by the belief that she was a wealthy, dying woman who may perhaps gift them a share of her supposed fortune in her will. All these characters appear to have wined, dined, and indulged in luxury with Dionne at their own expense, blinded by their hopes of a ""high return on investment"", which, of course, never materialized. Hornigold's alleged £300,000 loss included £180,000 in car debts - for vehicles he bought himself, expecting reimbursement by his mother. The film never interrogates these choices. What emerges is not a tale of deception, but of mutual opportunism. Rather than offering a balanced investigation, Con Mum glosses over uncomfortable truths and indulges in a reductive, black-and-white narrative that absolves some while vilifying one. The result is a shallow, one-sided account that evades the complexity of the story it claims to tell.",True
11,9,Well made,Lovelove21,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's nice movie based on interviews. Story is crazy in way how naive people can be. I would never thought people can be so easily manipulated but here we are watching another story on Netflix. I mean did they ever thought about do some investigation before giving her money. I feel sorry for everyone but mostly for his wife in such difficult period, that his mom ,as good scammer, sense danger and try to isolate. And even than he only should be on side of his wife with or without his mom in his life. Obviously she was toxic and he had happy 45 years of life without her. I'm happy his wife such a strong and wonderful person.",True
12,2,wondering who's the real con here,ledandswan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSo, this documentary although is somewhat interesting, is really a story said from the main character (Graham) for his own benefit. I really cant find any kind of sympathy for someone who left his own family and his newborn son only to go where the money was (or so he thought). No sympathy for someone who didnt want to listen to his partner and by the end of this so called documentary didnt want to thank her for saving him for present him with the truth... not only he left her and his son, but he took money from their joined bank account without telling her... I can understand all the psychology of Graham etc but he did no better towards his family and I feel that this doc is all about him cashing out. I think the real victims here are his partner, his son and the two other couples who lost everything. He didnt show any remorse towards what he did to his family and the way he behaved....and to thank only his friends and calling them a family was so egoistical after all the research his partner did.This doc leaves me with a sour taste cause i feel somehow betrayed that i was conned to support someone who is not really a victim...",True
13,10,Well Made Con Doc with a few surprises,imdbfan-2019275533,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerYou aren't really supposed to feel sympathy for Graham. He did some terrible things to follow a woman he wasn't even sure was his Mum. I feel greedy took over.You do feel enormous sympathy for his partner and child, however.The doc was clever in starting you of backing tye wrong team, as it were.Graham has had a hard life indeed, but that doesn't excuse treating your supportive partner the way he did. The makers did a great job of slowly revealing how bad his infatuation with this woman and her wealth had got.An eye opening tale, that takes you with it. You are surprised by each new development.",True
14,8,Well made!!,alexandraahlen,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is like so many documentaries about scammers and con artists a really interesting story. However, it is also truly unique when the connection between them biologically is ultimately revealed.I truly hope that those who are part of this documentary, and who were victims of this relentless woman, is compensated beyond all they have financially lost. I also hope that it can be a lesson for those who choose to, out of the kindness of their heart, give money without any actual security.The lesson is quite simple: do not ever trust anybody, not even yourself, and always make sure to listen to people around you who knows you when they say that something is wrong. But mostly, don't trust anybody and never ever lend out money to anybody, family or otherwise, because in the end the human nature is one of narcissism and it will always come down to yourself against the world - and that is a fact, even if you might think that the person you're lending money to, is someone you trust.Be careful. Relationships that are true does not involve any financial transactions.",True
15,5,"Like mum, like son",msghall,n/a,15/08/2025,"While the villain here is obviously the mum, the real villain to me is the son. Like his mum, Graham exhibits no real joy or anger or any genuine emotion. His cold retelling the story, his limp excuses, his emotionless expression, his negligence of his wife and son are all that needs to be told. Like so many people bordering on sociopathy, Graham tells a good tale and the doc makes it seems like he's a good guy, a victim. But he's not. Heather and his son are the real victims.While the documentary on the surface is kind to Graham, underneath you being to feel the creepiness of the man. It's not just that he and his mum look alike, they are alike in most ways. And that's the true value of the documentary. Unfortunately, not everyone will see through Graham and that's the shame.(Same could be said for the woeful Peng. He shows this documentary is also a story of the toll of avarice coupled with naivete has on people who put themselves first.)",False
16,8,This documentary made me cry,samitchadha,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen you think of scammers, you'd think of young people, unrelated or at least no mothers. This documentary made you realize that in this world you cant even trust mothers. This is shameful. Still, wonder how bad of a person can someone be to break her own son's marriage and take away the most loving support of wife & son from him. Some people are blaming Graham but you need to think from point of a person who just found her mother after 45 years. It was very difficult for him to have doubt her mother and more so when she has been telling him that she got cancer and is gonna die in 6months. Now moving to the documentary, the script and the play are well written & executed. Overall, the story and the movie made me cried.",True
17,8,Very Good Documentary,andrewimcdiarmid,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm reading some of the other reviews describing the 'characters' in this 'show', which I don't understand. It's a documentary not a show and these are subjects, they're not playing anyone. Maybe I'm not getting what they're saying, but it left me confused and I didn't agree with that take.Anyhow, I enjoyed this documentary. Netflix has been churning out these in greater numbers since Covid hit, and the thing about them is, sometimes they're great and other times it's just spent airwaves. Filler. I feel this one is a bit of both, but more so, I thought it was great.Let's get this out of the way: The mother is a piece of work. A bad person. The build up towards finding out exactly why takes a bit longer than perhaps is necessary, but I was also glad it didn't rush it towards that point then drag its feet telling the rest of the story. One of the reviews here said they couldn't take the wife's voice; I couldn't take the mother's voice. Especially as she continues to lie to her son. The only purpose it seems to serve having her in the background is annoy the viewer and paint them towards disliking her. Admittedly, it is effective in both.There are definitely some twists I wasn't expecting, even as you expect twists to occur. I did feel the quick tie-up of the couples divorce made Heather look somewhat selfish, but this documentary had a lot of that, selfish people that is. Still, one thing I think some may have missed here is that much of this was due to emotional manipulation and the human instinct to not believe that others are intentionally hurting them. As a third party we are able to see the story unfold and say we'd never let that happen to us, we wouldn't have done that, but life doesn't really unfold that way. He wanted a mother figure, and it seems very real at the time. It wouldn't have been easy to walk away.An enjoyable watch, no matter how you feel. Worth your time!",True
18,4,Could've Been Good... But That Voice,gr_circa,n/a,15/08/2025,"Con Mom had potential - the story is wild, the production isn't bad, and it's the kind of show that should pull you in easily. But there's one thing I just couldn't get past: Heather Kaniuk.She plays one of the main characters, but her voice is so painfully forced - like this fake, low, raspy tone that sounds like she's trying way too hard to be intense or mysterious. It's not natural, it's not engaging... it's just ugh. Every time she speaks, it completely takes me out of the story. It feels like a parody of a true crime character rather than a believable performance.I'm sorry, but it's genuinely one of the most irritating and frustrating vocal performances I've ever heard on a show. It's killing the vibe entirely.I wanted to like it, but I just can't sit through it with that voice constantly dragging things down.",False
19,8,the story of this man is sad and awful,lampadaire20002,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very good documentary.I was asking myself, if everyone in this documentary are the real protagonists, or if they are impersonated by actors.. the reason is that there is so many documents footage, and they appeared to be in superior quality, i know that phones can produce very good stuff, but here, you got more the impression of watching a movie than any stuff through Tik-tok... I mean, we see all along the movie shots of the (horrible) mother that are in a very good quality...
Well, however, watch this documentary, it's very well made, and i feel very sorry for this man and his awful mum. This kind of reminded me the novel of John Waters ""liar mouth"" , about a con artist, except in this documentary , the mum is even worst than the awful woman described by John Waters. Being WORST than a John Waters's character ... WOW!",False
20,10,Better Than Expected,Mehki_Girl,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was a little bit of a different scam from the typical ones.Primarily, this woman was a scammer all of her life and as she got older she used her age to pull people in, because who would expect an old lady to scam them?Obviously this lady is a sociopath. Couldn't care less about who she hurts. A complete predator who seeks out people's vulnerabilities and kindness and greed. I'm glad to see you at the end that Graham cut her off short.Let's not forget that you cannot rip anybody off without their participation and usually people participate because of their own greed of getting something for nothing or for very little and there are people out there willing to prey on you because of human nature.People should never think that a parent or family member wouldn't do that to them. There are young people, some still teens, out there, whose parents have abused their credit or opened up accounts in their name, not to mention parents pimping their kids on social media and ripping off their child stars.My husband and I both have been used and ripped off by our own family members. Now we keep our money to ourselves. We maintain separate accounts, but we pay our bills jointly.I thought this was a really well done documentary and didn't drag out anything too long. Not for nothing you could see the immediate pushiness and nastiness of this woman in a few of the clips - when the mask slipped - the first clue.I had a relative whom I've never met and who lives in another country who started sending me a nice little prayer greeting every single day on social media for a year and I would respond in kind.And then when she felt that she had buttered me up, she asked me for money. I didn't immediately respond but eventually later that day. I simply said, no.The communication immediately stopped.And there you go!",True
21,3,You can't be this naive just greedy,sajecha,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI just kept telling myself throughout this series: ""YOU CANT BE THIS NAIVE"" oh yeah that's because he was greedy.He ruined his entire life and relationship with such a supportive partner due to greed. He only met this woman (his mom Dionne) for 2.5 seconds and he was so trusting of her.No one with that much money and at her age throws money and flaunts their wealth at people like that.Really!!!! He believed that his mom was the sultan or heiress or whatever lie she concocted she was and was walking around without body guards.If she was that wealthy...1 why She purchased a car and you signed for it!!!!!2 why She asked you for money to pay hotel stays and you gave it to her????3 why She was sick and she didn't have her private doctor travel with her????4 why would she give money away to your friend whom she doesn't even knowThis was so frustrating plus slow to watch so I skipped all the way to the end just to see the outcome.

The part that saddened me the most though, was learning that Heather didn't stay with him - yet his friend did. I'm sure there is much more to it than revealed in this documentary, but I was bummed to hear it nonetheless. Also, I couldn't believe they waited until after everything took place to do a deep dive into her history to discover the truth about her. I feel like they could have avoided some of this, but then I wasn't there, so I don't know. Anyway, I'm just sad that she wasn't able to stick it out with him. He seemed like a decent guy.",True

We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars here people LOL. They were BOTH fooled and who wouldn't be when she's having banks let her have private after hours access?She was most likely already checking the costs of how much a nanny would cost and which villa she'll be vacationing at. Plus cruising in her new BMW SUV lol. She was 100% fine and happy enjoying her life at those fancy hotels. She now has the audacity to pretend NOW AFTER she's upset because he didn't spend Christmas with them when the guy was about to go sign some paper work to give them 100s of millions? Get real people........... If I grew up, and found out my dad decided to spend Christmas with me as a newborn instead of going to get the bag I'd be more upset than the wife!Seems ultimately the wife only married him due to him being a successful and well off financially chef and once he wasn't that anymore and no longer inheriting millions she decided to pack it up.",True

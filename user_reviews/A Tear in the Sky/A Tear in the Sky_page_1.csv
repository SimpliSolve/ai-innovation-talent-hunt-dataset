1,4,The truth is out there (but not in this documentary),perfect_circle21,n/a,16/08/2025,"The idea behind 'A Tear in the Sky' is a fantastic one: Get a group of scientists, experts and ex-military men to team up and observe a UFO hotspot, using state-of-the-art equipment. The result is ultimately disappointing because the group are given an incredibly short window of time (5 days) to produce their results. Ideally, the team should've been given months, not days to observe the skies and gather evidence. It was great to see the ex-navy guys Kevin Day and Gary Voorhis being given the chance to participate in a project like this. But the quality of the findings was incredibly poor. Grainy or distant footage and small objects that only appeared on screen for a split second. If the public is going to take the UFO/UAP phenomenon seriously, we have to come up with much better evidence than this.",False
2,4,Some interesting content but truly dreadful film making.,kieronjp,n/a,16/08/2025,"There were some fairly interesting things caught by the expedition, and a couple of the people working on the movie are very knowledgeable, but the horrendous, public domain soundtrack and sensationalising vocabulary used by Corey et al ruined what could have been a decent watch. Karaaaaaaaaaazy, increeeeeeeedible, worrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrld changing, amaaaaaaaazing and woooooooooooow, the discoveries were not. Kind of interesting and worth following up on, they were. The tech nerd who owned most of the kit was great, but do all UFO movie makers go to the same History Channel sponsored film school? No wonder so many serious people still laugh at a very serious subject. Waaaaaaaaaaay overpriced at 4 bucks. The grift continues while we still remain in the dark about what a very real phenomena actually is. Shame.",False
3,4,A Personal Passion.,heratyplant,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't want to rain on the filmmakers parade, as this is obviously a passion project, bt this could have been so much better & will leave many people cold.A personal hate of mine was the somewhat nasuiting green screen backgrounds, they are very decent these days, but they're very over the top & overused here. Real locations are always a better idea & if you can't do that, have some visual flow between interviewees, here though, there were just too many different, jarring backdrops used. Another production note, the editing was at somewhat of a junior level & a few times quite clumsy, this will always make your film look cheap.Shatner, Kaku & a few other high profilers have kindly lent their weight to lift A Tear In The Sky's profile, but to no great success. Shatner & Kaku sitting in front of more eye popping green screens & looking like they've just woken up from their afternoon naps do nothing to further whatever point is trying to be made & in the end it's all been said before.We then meet our gallant group of investigative lads, who armed with the latest tech, try to capture what has already been captured, but just capturing it again with their own gear. This is the entire premise of the show, and it's up to you to decide whether it was a success or failure.Then we have Caroline Cory, the chipper leader of our merry band of Ufologists & the one driving the cash grab truck, for, however genuine everyone's interest is here, the premise for this show is so fundamentally weak from the start, that anyone still awake by the end will be left wondering, what was the point of any of it?!?Honestly, it's not terrible, but with all it's lofty intentions, it's nothing we all haven't seen before & done better.",False
4,3,Brings nothing new to the table,mrheub,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe whole premise of this film is to try to get better footage of the UFOs that were filmed in 2004 near Catalina island (the famous Nimitz case with the Tic Tac UFO) by going to the same location with all kinds of expensive gear for 5 days.Unfortunately, they were not able to capture anything conclusive. Basically just a hole in the clouds with blinking lights at night that they call a ""wormhole"".All their footage is more grainy than the original FLIR videos from the Navy.As if they filmed with an iphone through night vision goggles... Oh wait, they did.But they still decided to follow through with the film project (to recoup some of the money they spent I guess).They also use William Shatner's name to try to lure viewers even though he doesn't really contribute anything.Even him, the professional actor, can't seem to manage to be excited about the footage and sound convincing when he says it's ""craaazy"".I also feel like there was no need for the director to feature herself so prominently in the film.I'm still giving it 3 stars for the project itself and the efforts that went into it. It could have turned out better if they'd been lucky, but the results they got were not conclusive enough to deserve a film, in my opinion.If you want to watch a good documentary about UAPs, just watch The Phenomenon by James Fox.And if you want some evidence of the existence of something else out there, just smoke DMT.",True
5,1,Just for fun I edited this down to see how much could be cut out...,Sean_Biggins,n/a,16/08/2025,"...and when I was finished, there was almost nothing left. The woman has a REALLY annoying voice btw. This is one of those typical docs where they spend 90% of it setting up equipment and blabbing away to 'guests', in this case William Shatner of all people who'ill do any interview for a few bucks to help pay for his horse addiction. But there was just a lot of blabber and then they finally got something on a FLIR camera that showed up as a dot and then disappeared and that's pretty much the whole sha-bang right there. They think it was a UFO that was there one second and then vanished into another dimension or wormhole or whatever.I found it very disappointing for the most part.",False
6,1,Really??,sullacollina,n/a,16/08/2025,"The moment the commander of the spaceship enterprise enters the screen, one should be alerted to the very real possibility that this show is not a documentary but just another idea on how to make cash out of the UFO debate. And as for Caroline Cory, really! I cant imagine a less sincere person to to compare this abomination: does she even know what UFO stands for? Please, could someone make a serious documentary about this subject and stop using it just to make money.",False
7,1,Lies in the Skies,waldoborolibby,n/a,16/08/2025,"Worthless ""treasure hunt"" show like all those awful TV shows on the History Channel and Discover.A bunch of scientists set up equipment on rooftops in Laguna Beach and Catalina and show us dots of light they film and track but they never tells what they are ... only what they think they might perhaps be.William Shatner appears for no reason as he has nothing to do with the ""scientific search."" Nor does the annoying hostess.Lots of graphs and charts and instruments ... but no substance. Why this was released as a ""documentary"" is anyone's guess.",False
8,n/a,Lame,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe science if true shows something but nothing . Not convinced they found anything . If they actually had this would be headlines all over the world ... it was not . Bottom line there are portals opening up and ufos fly through them . They claim they have documented this .,True
9,3,Annoying Presenter!,tadted,n/a,16/08/2025,A fairly interesting look at some unexplained phenomena but nothing ground-breaking. The over the top presenting by Cory with her coat hanger grin did tend to take away some credibility from the study but it was interesting to listen to the eye witnesses of the events the film was based on.,False
10,9,Very Informative,bethandbrandy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary proves that citizen scientists, not the US government, needs to be the ones investigating the UFO/UAP phenomena. Science does not lie and cover up, but the US government does. This video proves that the UFO videos that have been published are real because this group of scientists saw the same phenomena. In addition they saw an additional anomaly that wIth further study could prove that worm holes/portals are quite possibly real and not just a hypothesis. Watch and learn.The only reason I didn't give a 10 star review is because there were some sound problems when they were out in the mobile unit and I couldn't' t hear what was said.",False
11,2,Proves Nothing,carlos512,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although the effort and enthusiasm is obvious and commendable, at the end we do not see any absolutely conclusive proof of anything. Yes, there are some distant dot lights, yes there is some strange radiation reading in one of the instruments, and that's it. I wish there was more. Of course, we were hoping for more, unfortunately no. Is that stuff an opening of a worm hole? How could anybody say for sure. We would not wish it is? But the star scientists can't tell for sure. They think it could be a worm hole. They think. Nothing conclusive. Good effort, but nothing else. Unfortunately.",False
12,n/a,Was that an infomercial?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"No way the film was made by the woman as claimed, this is an obvious team of amateur filmmakers and just plopped her name on it. She also seems to be acting, and really comes off as trying to sell me a new kitchen utensil or something. There's no new interesting information here either. 2/10.",False
13,1,False Information,slayetville,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the first 10 mins we are told false information, for example, David Fravour saw ONE tiktac ufo, this doc says he saw "" a rain of ufos"" . They give a short animation of it. Completely wrong. Dont waste your time and money.",False
14,1,Lies,cookenelson-49484,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn the first few mins this documentary they say David Fravor saw lots of TicTac UFOs over the Ocean, they even give a animation to go along with this. HOWEVER David Fravor has said he and his fellow pilots only saw ONE.Whats worse, George Knapp and other well respected investigators are praising the documentary.",True
15,1,No Good. Forced Myself to Finish the Show.,eazylnova,n/a,16/08/2025,"Youtube videos are way better. This ""show"" was as fake as they get. Poor Poor Poor. Nothing substantial. Looks like kindergarten acting. Rate 1 star for the high tech Cameras only.",False
16,1,Major Holes -- Literally -- in Alleged Facts and Assertions,j-a-lind,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerEarly on in the movie, on ""Day One"" while only a portion of their equipment is set up, there's an alleged UAP sighting and on a large HDTV watching it in 4k I could clearly tell it's an aircraft with blinking navigation lights. Then their cell phone system fails preventing one monitoring location from notifying the other two, the consequence is inability to triangulate anything. Other sensors fail at critical times. Naturally occurring large ice crystals falling from the sky as they become too heavy in cloud cover, are touted as ""UAPs/UFOs"". Ultimately, on the fifth day, a cloud of questionable pixels within a naturally occurring atmospheric cloud is suddenly touted as being a wormhole and proof of alien life. What? There was no ""smoking gun"" of a clearly identifiable alien craft. There was no ""smoking gun"" of a clearly identifiable alien creature. Proof of alien life . . . And said life visiting Earth? I'm calling BS. It's all hogwash, created by a group absolutely desperate to justify movies like this, and willing to spout falsehoods doing so.",True
17,8,Sincerity of Intention Alone does not make for good science- or a good film.,donovandesign,n/a,16/08/2025,"A History Channel-type of forced documentary that had too many holes in it to be taken seriously. From the technical aspect of how they were going to collect their "" data"" to how poorly the sighting were being communicated from the island to the shore house- meaning after the sighting was over!The crew simply seemed like it was all filmed after the fact. I hate to say it was bad acting, but it felt somewhat embarrassing on quite a few occasions.As far as the technical problems with the effort, please read the other fine reviews here. Sincerity of intention alone does not make for good research or a good doc.",False
18,10,Don't listen to any bad review,justinoneill,n/a,16/08/2025,These guys are doing real science and publicizing it and we need more research like this. And they made some really good findings! I can only imagine if the same scientist did this 365 days out of the year (instead of the 5 it was filmed in). I look forward to seeing more research exactly like this. Great job putting the documentary together.,False
19,n/a,"Amazing for beginners, questionable for advanced UFO-researchers",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great movie, highly recommended. Several US Navy guys and a US Air Force guy join forces with a proven Producer (see Her earlier movies, Superhuman, E. T. Contact: They Are Here) to examine advanced aerial technologies.I think this film is part of the mainstream drip drip disclosure: we don't know whether the users of these technologies (UAPs) might be neutral or good intentioned aliens, or bad aliens. This remains in vagueness, just like in the TV-reports.The film does not even mention the possibility of unacknowledged, back-engineered secret space programs, which have been mentioned in several recent UFO-movies, although it does show some acknowledged advanced military technologies, as a possible explanation to the seemingly alien phenomena.Mostly, the movie follows the new, politically correct speech of UAPs instead of UFOs, though the producer uses both expressions. They are not aerial and not phenonema: interdimensional and sentient beings.I don't understand, why did they not have a look at high definition weather satellite data to check out that warmhole-like tear in the clouds?Still, I do recommend for everyone to buy and watch this movie.",False
20,10,Caroline Cory makes history,JCerletti,n/a,16/08/2025,"Caroline Cory makes history with her all Star team of ex military, scientists, UFO researchers, and state of the art technology to compile data on the existence of UFOs off the coast of Southern California.One other thing the movie covers which is rarely discussed is the PTSD many witnesses have after having an encounter which I closely identified with.This is one of, if not the best UFO documentary I have seen in my over 20 years of research into this phenomenon.Excellent work Caroline Cory, OMNium Media, and everyone involved with the film.-Joe Cerletti.",False
21,10,Jay dropping disclosure what is out there,martijngerards,n/a,16/08/2025,"This latest documentairy of Caroline Cory shows that with the newest and ultra-modern equipment, it is finally possible to record data on that has never done before. I wonder if this is the new era of Science!!!!!!",False
22,10,Valuable scientific results,eirikrohalden,n/a,16/08/2025,"I must say that all negative responses on this documentary is just speculations and prejudices. They never document their claims in any scientific way.In paper ""Initial Results From the First Field Expedition of UAPx to Study Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena"" by M. Szydagis et. Al. The latest scientific results regarding the observations in the documentary is presented in a scientific way.If you do not have time or do not want to read the paper then just do not make any comments about the scientific content in the documentary.The UAP phenomena is real, take it seriously, it is an increasing number of scientific educated people working in this field now. I am certain that the coming results will benefit the humanity.Eirik Rø

23,10,The secret to see beyond the veil.,glynmaclean,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn my opinion, Caroline Cory is the Spielberg of 21st Century Documentaries.You are about to experience the work of a gifted writer, director and producer.An industry leader who is pioneering the rationalisation of 'out of this world' factual entertainment, so that it makes plain sense to mainstream audiences.While you may be discovering Caroline's work as Producer, Director and Writer, for the first time, there are in fact three brilliant films that precede A TEAR IN THE SKY. I encourage you to own all of them as a compendium to grow your perception.As you watch Caroline's work, perhaps like me, you will come to a sense that what we have here is a talented storyteller.A leader who has corralled the right cast of people to reshape how we may reconstitute our collective thought process, from a social conformity that rejects the unknown for fear of ridicule, to each become sovereign in our logical and scientific perceptions of our world.You might like to think of A TEAR IN THE SKY as important a work as THE SECRET (Law of Attraction) that lifts the veil off our cognitive conscious capacity to perceive what has always been there.THROUGH SCIENCE.For more context about how and why I perceive Caroline's greatness, I had the rare opportunity to work on a Hollywood education project with Steve Ecclesine. Steve related his experiences to me while working with Orson Wells (watch ""They'll Love Me When I'm Dead"" to see Steve talk about that Orson Wells experience.And having rubbed shoulders with some of Hollywood's
more prolific producers, I am can see Caroline's capabilities through the filter of their greatness.Like all great works, A TEAR IN THE SKY is a story that unfolds on you like buying a lotto ticket. You buy it knowing the risks, hope for everything, but expect nothing, then suddenly you realise you have actually won something significant! And it just hits you: ENGLIGHTENMENT! REVELATION!SPOILER ALERTVery little of our reality is measurable to science.Human beings can only perceive one percent, that's just the energy available to us as the visible light spectrum.While scientific instruments can help us understand a little bit more. As we catch what we can across the radio frequency spectrum, quantum science then goes on attempting to fill the gaps by finding God particles, but has terrible trouble measuring dark matter and 'everything else'.Caroline comes to the subject of the unknown 'everything else' that can't be measured, reminding us to embrace our curiosity, with a childlike sense of wonder.We are invited to take a practical, logical, hands-on scientific exploration of the universe we live in, and our own neighbourhoods.We are encouraged not to be fearful.We are inspired to collaborate.We should be curious.Now it's your turn.See beyond the veil.",True

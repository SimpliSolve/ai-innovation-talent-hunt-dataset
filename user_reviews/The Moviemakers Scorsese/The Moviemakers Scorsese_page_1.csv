1,7,A presentable and summarized at the life and work of Scorsese,Rodrigo_Amaro,n/a,15/08/2025,"An okay and comprehensive look at one of the greatest filmmakers of all time and one of the most supporters/defenders of film history,
the excellent Martin Scorsese, this special covers in a brief manner his life and work through several archive interviews with the man, and clips
of his films. A narrator and two film historians talk about his films, their opinions are so-and-so in between some curious facts about Marty's
early life and his works.Since the director is always someone I like to see and hear talking about movies and other topics, I won't say that
were anything wrong about this piece, except that it skips plenty of movies that I liked to be featured in it (""Casino"", Bringing Out the Dead"",
""The Aviator"" and ""Silence"", none of them addressed at all.Gladly, it's not one of those AI documentaries that are trending lately, there are
humans behind this which made this more enjoyable, and the only thing that will reward viewers will be the several interview clips of Scorsese
sharing his thoughts - the part revolving ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" was fascinating and there's even a dull criticism from a Catholic priest
who watched the movie and was appalled with it (which part of the opening titles he failed to see that it's not a representation of the Gospels?).It kept me entertained and interesting through it all but it mostly showed me things I already knew about the masterful director. It's alright. 7/10.",False

1,10,Life-Changing Film Experience. Bringing hope to the hopeless,tas-14751,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a must see film for any one who has been touched by addiction, alcoholism, despair, hopelessness and for those searching for a way to feel purpose in their lives. Watching this incredible documentary, so beautifully filmed & edited, I was touched to the depths of my soul. It was so inspiring and motivating for me to see the power of healing transformation and the ripple effect Bobbi Jo Reed had on others. For those searching to connect with purpose in a meaningful way, watch this movie & see the impossible become possible. What's the purpose of our lives? Bobbi Jo Reed shows us that by having the courage and desperation to face our inner demons to heal we are called to reach out to someone who is suffering and share our miracle and support until they can find their own.",False
2,10,A highly encouraging documentary.,fitforfaith-ministries,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is one-of a kind. You watch it and you will never forget it.Some of the content is very hard to watch, but at the end it simply shows the extremes of society we often willingly or unwillingly ignore. It shows the results of a fallen world and what might happen if we live in total disobedience to Him, or if simply circumstances hit us.But on the other hand it shows the wonderful redemption and forgiveness of our sins we can experience, and that He can restore a totally broken life to something millions of viewers and hearers will praise afterwards, no matter if they are believers or not.It is incredible what one single person can do and Bobbi Jo is simply a very powerful example of how to help literally thousands of others, no matter all the obstacles she experienced even after she got physically and spiritually saved. What a powerful testimony, and what a powerful woman.",False
3,10,To the uninformed realreviewrva,rodbosma,n/a,16/08/2025,"This story is 100% real. I have known this woman and her family personally for many years. She has helped more than 10,000 addicts over the last 20 years. And by the way, she earned absolutely nothing from this documentary. It was her way of promoting the ministry to raise awareness and help others in need. Bobbi Jo is the most spirit filled person I have ever met. Nobody can match her energy and love for others. If you don't believe in miracles you have never been to Healing House.Sorry you did not ""buy it"" realreviewrva but you are dead wrong and haters are never helpful! Please do your research before posting hateful uninformed reviews.",False
4,2,The message I got was ..,realreviewrva,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf i come up with a cock n bull story, like bobbi jo did.. that my head was repeatedly smashed into concrete by every man I've known.. raped, beaten, beaten so severely head smashed into walls and doors.. let me tell you something if somebody smashes your head into concrete you're not going to live to tell. Maybe Bobby Jo's made up stories ( that nobody was aware of or witnessed at the time including her family) of repeated beatings in the head .. hit a heart string with some people it just rings out of snake oil to me.. and obviously her snake oil did her well I don't know how you go from being a Street person with extensive brain damage to being a shrewd financial businesswoman who's able to take out loans and rehab homes that easily get into hundreds of thousand dollars... Nothing about her family indicated any kind of dysfunction as I know it.. her brother seem very well adapted polite men and her father was a police officer and she still found a way to depict her childhood as disadvantaged..typical whiney white woman.. I don't believe for one minute half the story she says happened to her.I worked an operating room for 20 years nobody gets their head smashed into the sidewalk or gets a boot to their head and gets up walking and functioning again
Obviously her abuse, if there ever was any, was not asas she describes. Where's the mutilation scars? Her arms her face her chest everything looks fine we're supposedly she took all the beatings.Anyway it just angers me that the public falls for this kind of stuff this is not how reality works.. woman was entitled already and she is furthering her entitlement by creating sob stories that never existed.. her photos from the time she was supposedly being abused of her dressed up and looking perfectly healthy and happy, not a frightened abused bloody mess as she'd have you believe.Im not buying it.",True

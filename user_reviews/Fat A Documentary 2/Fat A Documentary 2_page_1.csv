1,10,First hand experience,mcudworth,n/a,16/08/2025,"This way of eating has helped me in so many ways. I don't need a fancy study to tell me it works. I have tried every diet imaginable, and keto/low-carb is the only one that is sustainable for me. For some the environment is more important than human health. If you research where you food comes from and not just blindly buy any protein offered, you can help to sustain farmers who treat their animals ethically and feed them properly. When the animals are treated and fed properly you don't have the issues that so many hang their beliefs on.Before you judge, try it, you may find you feel better than you ever have.",False
2,1,What the hell is this???,fabriziocucci,n/a,16/08/2025,The only non-documentary that manages to say nothing at all for 1h and 20m.,False
3,10,Solid documentary,alanahudkins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well-made and educational, solid science and research with sources provided. It's not easy to hear that the food industry has been lying to us for decades, but that's just how it is. It may not be the most entertaining or flashy documentary, but you'll learn a lot and maybe even get a little angry.",False
4,1,"Incredibly badly done, don't waste your time",lenkaciz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredibly badly done. Don't waste time to watch. ""It's food of warriors""? Really? How about the impact on the environment? That's also untrue? It would be great to educate yourself people.",False
5,8,I learned something new,gheksteen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yet another good documentary. I thought I had learned most things there is to know about this subject, but I did learn some new things in this one. For someone starting from scratch it might be better to watch a similar documentary called Fat Fiction for instance, but if you already know a thing or two about diet, then this is an excellent choice, as they dive a bit deeper into why public recommendations are like they are, in spite of science contradicting this. I highly recommend if you are into healthy eating and healthy living. My only complaint is that they could have gone a bit quicker through some of the points. But overall really good.",False
6,1,A documentary brought to you by the meat industry,ampjonr,n/a,16/08/2025,"I suffered through this documentary. It was filled with a bunch of people paid to promote the medicines you only need because the meat industry has poisened us. I am not vegan. I go eat small portions of meat, but the hatred this spews on how vegan diets aren't sustainable, but claim keto/Atkins diets are is laughable! The meat we eat these days isn't the meat at the beginning of the 20th century. Heart disease wasn't the leading cause of death until the 60s. Let that sink in. Right in the time frame where animal based diets were pushed. Don't waste your time feeding your brain with bad advice not based on science.",False

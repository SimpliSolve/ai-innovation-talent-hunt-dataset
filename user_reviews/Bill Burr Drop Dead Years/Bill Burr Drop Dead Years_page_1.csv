1,8,Bill's Still Got It!,ldee-38075,n/a,15/08/2025,"Bill is back. I'm glad to see he's still got his edge. Only he can take self reflection and turn it on its head with whitey but yet crass humor. His political commentary is also spot on. While listening to this special, I find myself not just laughing but nodding my head in full agreement with his exposition.Tbh, this was one of those specials that gets better as you rewatch it. Certain jokes hits at a different time and I just didn't fully appreciate it the first time around. This is my third time through and I'm laughing it all over. A lot of other specials don't have this type of staying power, and for sure, I will be watching it for the fourth and fifth time. Enjoy!",False
2,6,2nd half is pretty good.,peteoneillbass,n/a,15/08/2025,"Its weird, the first half is mostly Bill talking about how hes learning to chill out a bit in his old age...and it wast funny. It came off as safe, middle of the road, aging comedian stuff...I was worried that Bill had finally become the staring old man whos actually dead on the inside from his famous bit....but around the half way point, the old troll goblin we all love comes out and starts swinging for the fences. I had some good laughs.Honestly I hope Bill is taking care of himself, but I think this special shows us 2 ways his career could go at this point...into safe mainstream weak comedy, or into the future as a bonafide immortal comedy legend.Bill do what you gotta do in your home life, but keep that RAGE on the STAGE. It's you at your best.",False
3,8,Khalid_t,RealReviewer64,n/a,15/08/2025,"The show is terrific. But I feel that Bill is being pulled back all the time the way that Jim Jeffries was. Once fully unleashed again we could get him back to his funniest self and when funny he is superb.I would like to urge everyone to report false and political reviews like the one by a character called Khalid_t. Assuming he is real he posts political statements completely at odds with Bill Burrs comedy. So very odd.Back to Bill, there are some corkers to be enjoyed here. Don't fast forward or skip because his asides and one liners are him often at his best.The downside?Why does he shout so much?!",False
4,9,Billy's best special in years,talismanthirteen,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's great seeing how Burr has evolved since Chappelle Show while growing up and staying true to himself. It's also fun seeing him riff on subjects he has seemingly already done, but has found new perspectives as he has matured. There are probably going to be some political tears in other reviews despite the fact he doesn't let either side off the hook. I still love that he is one of the few white comedians to tackle American racism in a thoughtful, nuanced, and hilariously truthful way. His last couple of specials weren't bad but they didn't land with me as his older material had. And it sounds like he has been through a lot later in life. As a guy in my late 40s it resonates. His joke about fighting his dad was so on point I had to pause it. Definitely worth the watch and looking forward to seeing him continue to grow.",False
5,9,Something For Everyone,imdbfan-6632511021,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of his best specials. It is all of the things I appreciate about Bill Burr's style. If you're a long time fan of the podcast or his stand up, there's still plenty of fresh material here to keep you invested and laughing. If you're neither, it's a fantastic stand up special that feels organic and unapologetic for all the right and funny reasons. Tame by Bill Burr's standards, but well thought out and unbelievably funny in a world full of cookie cutter stand up material. There are times when the jokes drag on just a bit too long, but I'm genuinely grasping at straws trying to find constructive criticism here. One of my favorite stand up specials in a long time.",False
6,10,This may be his best special.,amesethan,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the best of Bill Burr's entire comedic persona, but more distilled, concentrated and refined.This special might not be for everyone, particularly those people who want him to remain as the Bill Burr of 10-15 years ago. Buy, as a long-time fan, I can safely say that he's reached a nexus of his comedic evolution in ""Drop Dead Years."" He combines his own personal evolution with introspective, bald-faced honesty (pun intended?) that's still very much so the same Bill Burr. He isn't rebranded, muzzled, or watered down - he's just a wiser, reflective lunatic who, despite having opened his heart up a bit more, somehow still spares no one.",False
7,10,Hilarious!,dmaj-31832,n/a,15/08/2025,"The people who rated this special lower than 5 are in the category of people who Bill talks about that wear namaste shirts and make heart shapes with their hands.If it's not for you, be fair and rate 5. People are such harsh a**holes these days.My husband, brother and I are huge fans on Bill, especially 'I'm Sorry You Feel That Way' and 'Walk Your Way Out' specials, and we were so pleased to have the same kind of vibe back with this one.I agree with some of the other comments that it's funnier when you rewatch it because of the things you miss.He is one of the GOATS, we had to pause to stop laughing in parts.",False
8,5,Meh,calumstevenson,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNot sure where the 10/10 ratings came from, this isn't Bill's strongest material by quite a margin.Usually his specials are a fairly reliable chuckle but this was pretty dry, maybe the material needed a bit more time to cook.The observations on the perceptions of men's mental health were probably the strongest part of the show along with his musings on the KKK.Otherwise there's some middling bits about how Bill improved his marriage by being more open to suggestions from his wife after contemplating hours own mortality at the funerals of friends. Felt more like being a fly on the wall in his therapy session. If I was in the audience I'd send him an invoice for the hour.",True
9,10,"Bill's Best Yet: Thoughtful, Sharp, and Genuinely Funny",imdbfan-8169059542,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's refreshing to see that stand-up comedy can still be genuinely funny. Too often, comedians rely on saying something ""edgy"" just for shock value, but when Bill does it, he actually brings up meaningful points in a way that feels natural and well-crafted. Great comedy makes you think, and that's exactly what his latest special accomplishes-it's both thought-provoking and entertaining from start to finish. This is his best work yet, showcasing his ability to analyze different subjects with nuance, wit, and precision. It's this sharp insight and masterful delivery that solidify him as one of the greats in comedy.",False
10,9,There's so much here,wfrrtrp,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's fascinating seeing ""Ol' Billy Red Bush navigate becoming a father. I first heard his material in 2004-2007ish on this cool new app called Pandora. I heard these cool 3 minute bits as part of a comedy channel. Back then he was an angry hilarious butthole. A few months later I saw him in person at the Improv in Houston, Tx. Back then he was just a young ranting comic with solid material that connected with me as a 24ish year old. Now, all these years later, I see him evolving, as both a comedian and a man and a father . And as a dad of 21 years, I can relate to this so much . The bald ginger is 100 authentic.",False
11,10,He's still got it!,delvis-75701,n/a,15/08/2025,"He still knows how to make people laugh. His style is priceless. Brutally honest, and not afraid to push the boundaries of the cancel culture. If you get offended by the hilarity of everyday life, maybe it is not for you. His negative reviews from his Saturday Night Live opening came from people who forgot what humor is. I have seen him live in Detroit, and the unedited shows are even better. I suggest you watch what ever you can see of his shows on streaming platforms. I believe that he has one of his many stand up shows available on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu, and probably more.",False
12,10,His best work yet,khalid_t-17530,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some might not like the contents of his material, but that's part of being a great comedian is. There are some who just make you feel immediately at ease when they start their set. Like George Carlin, like Dave Chappelle, like Richard Pryor, like Bill Hicks. Just being their borderline annoying charmless, but real self.Bill is that guy that keeps you engaged and curious for the whole set. Knowing what you're gonna get, but still be pleasantly surprised by the punchline. 10 stars.Slight correction for Bill: yes, you gotta work around the children when you're fighting a war, but you don't have to when you're doing something else. Starts with g, ends with e.",False
13,3,A self-proclaimed broken man filtered through his wife.,imdbfan-9403316634,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been a fan of Bill Burr for a long time. As he has gotten older, he has calmed down a bit. It's to be expected and don't hold that against him.However, everything that he thinks seemingly is now filtered through his wife. He doesn't go too controversial on anything by downplaying most things. The stuff he tries to go hard at seems to things his wife would want talked about. It is a very narrow but highly encouraged to debate discussion window. ""Why is the KKK still around?"" Very brave Bill. I'm sure all three members will be pissed.Telling us what a broken man he is which is a cry for help more than anything. It was bad and peak ""modern audience"" comedy, which is just a talkative therapy session with safe jokes. You can see classic Bill for a few laughs but the moment drops dead before you know it.",False
14,9,Impressed.,neilleeds-38880,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have to admit I was a massive bill burr fan and I listened to his podcast religiously. But after a while I just got bored of the la privelaged yawn a lot stories of helicopters and cigars . I couldn't relate . But watching this I think bill has grown so much . It's pretty radical , not that he wasn't before but I feel he's thrown away the shackles and tackled subjects like a human being . And I have to say I laughed a lot . And how rare is that these days !!! His wife stuff was funny. And then he got down to real topics and I was impressed at his honesty and his take on such divisive subjects . I have to say well done bill burr 👍 at 56 years old your still current and you still can make me laugh out loud and god thank you for that.",True
15,10,"Not the most hysterical Burr special, but most real and authentic one",ironman-35840,n/a,15/08/2025,"Been a long long time fan of Burr. This was a nice change of pace from the past specials with hilarious rants he usually goes on or roasting women and wives. First burr special where he goes under the hood and discusses his journey so far, the conflict of being an angry comic and fearing losing your edge if you try to grow as a person and paints an honest picture of our culture and society at the moment and where it's headed. It was hilarious still and extremely genuine and authentic. It was awesome to see his evolution as a person and how it translated to his act being more true to himself and talking about real things without the constant stress of injecting as many jokes in your act as you could.",False
16,10,Burr real,stefanbarrie,n/a,15/08/2025,"A very strong start, a strong finish which is very refreshing for stand up comedians, we didn't even realise where the middle was it was so engrossing, an outstanding energetic and real personible performance, through and through a great show. Honest and witty performance stretching multiple topics including everything from political stuff to the day to day stuff many will relate to. Not going to be hilarious for everyone, we think it's probably only certain generations it will actually really relate to, for those however who do relate to the situations, this is pure gold. It'll most likely fall flat and score low with people it offends, which is very much part of the appeal of the performance.",False
17,2,In my Opinion...Not His Best,jtjunkbox-94010,n/a,15/08/2025,"Been a Bill Burr fan for years. This is not his best work and a continued downslide (not that he'd care my opinion). Definitely funny moments in this. But the old, unfiltered honesty and equal opportunity roasting has given way to more of a reflection on his personal views (which is fine for comedians in general, but hard to take from someone so traditionally unattached). The shock value is gone, and he seems to try to try to rely more on his old schtick. Problem is he's vocal enough in general and so topical that he very much contradicts his recurring statement, ""don't listen to me I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't follow the news."" Worth the watch but low rated as it doesn't measure up even close to his previous specials.",False
18,2,"Very sad, strange, flat, and disappointing.",woanerges,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis special felt very different. Bill - he's become empty on the inside, completely colorless, lacking that passion, and fire, and this progressively shows in his last specials. They are becoming flat, boring. There last special has completely lost any edginess, and it definitely feels like Bill's mind is filtered through his wife's ambitions and interests. This whole special actually made me feel uncomfortable because it's like I was a third person sitting somewhere in the corner, listening to some married guy's private conversation with his psychologist. Very weird.Bill's interested have changed completely. He's a completely different person now - now all his interests align completely with his wife's interests, and views. Very sad to watch.Also, he used the same jokes from the old special, just rephrased them. Like the joke about someone breaking into your house, and being ready. It's literally that same old joke, just told in a different way, and by the way - the first time it was very funny. This version, the way he delivered that same old joke was weaker, much weaker. This wasn't funnier then the first time. It was weak. So what was the point of repeating the same old joke again, if it's worse them the first time? It was very shocking to see him repeating old jokes from the previous specials.Bill really needs to see how he's allowing his wife to continue rewiring him. He says that he's found inner peace, faced his old demons, but it's not true. He needs to understand that he is who he is, and that can't ever change. He can try to make himself believe that he's changing, but it is not true. You are who you are. You can try to suppress it like what his wife is trying to do to him, you can try to hide it, but eventually it'll only make you more depressed. The only true way to find inner peace is to embrace who you are, accept it, and love it. Accept yourself, Bill - you are who you are - an angry ignorant ginger man who just constantly can't believe all this sh**, and we all love you for that. Everybody already loves you for who you are and accepts you, Bill, but can YOU love and accept your real self, what makes you - you?The only words I can find to describe this special are: strange, uncomfortable, sad, flat, disappointing. Very disappointing.Very sad situation. I hope Bill will feel better soon.",True
19,5,Half As Good,CryptoGuy,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first half of this special features an old man complaining, using a whiney voice to sound humorous but not say anything funny. I was worried. Burr is a legend. However, legends do fade away, given enough time. But it was too soon for that.Thankfully, the second half picked up, and I saw the Bill Burr we all know and love. It does feel like he's playing it safe, but I suppose that goes with age for some. His observational humor is less insightful and more on the nose. There is less self-deprecating humor this time around. That's what made Burr likable, in my opinion. He would eviscerate subjects and then make it personal, which is hilarious because many of us would see ourselves in him or someone we knew. Not so much now. Still worth watching, though.",False
20,2,Bill Burr's Comedy Goes Soft-A Sharp Decline from His Peak,jonnybro-157-843679,n/a,15/08/2025,"Bill Burr used to be comedy gold-sharp, fearless, and unapologetic. Specials like You People Are All the Same and Paper Tiger showcased his ability to slice through life's absurdities with raw, unfiltered humor. But Drop Dead Years? It's a letdown. The edge is gone, and I can't shake the feeling that his wife might have ruined his creative brain.Since getting married, Burr's comedy has shifted-and not for the better. The once relentless, boundary-pushing style has softened into something more cautious and introspective. It's like the Bill Burr who thrived on chaos has been domesticated, and this special pays the price. Instead of sharp takes, we get tired riffs on gender stereotypes-""men do this, women do that""-that feel more whiny than clever. It's the kind of material you'd expect from a rookie, not a seasoned pro.His political jabs don't fare much better. Bits about Elon Musk and #MeToo land with a thud, muddled and lacking the bite that used to make his commentary stand out. He seems caught between critiquing cancel culture and tiptoeing around it, leaving us with a wishy-washy mess that's neither funny nor thought-provoking. The audience's polite, half-hearted laughs throughout the special say it all: this isn't the Burr they signed up for.Look, comedians change-fair enough. But when that change feels like a retreat into safe, predictable territory, it's disappointing. I can't help but think his wife's influence has dulled his creative spark. The Bill Burr who once dissected the world with surgical precision is missing from Drop Dead Years, replaced by a tamer version who's lost his fire. If this is where he's headed, I'll stick to his old stuff.",False
21,1,Bill Burr's 'Drop Dead Years' Falls Flat,tor_erik_sire,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was really disappointed with Bill Burr: Drop Dead Years. As a longtime fan, I expected his signature sharp wit and fearless humor, but this special felt like a tired rehash of old rants with none of the punch. The introspective angle sounded promising, but it came off as self-indulgent and dragged the energy down. The jokes were predictable-male sadness, dating advice, blah blah-nothing fresh or clever. Even his delivery seemed off, like he was just going through the motions. For a comedian known for pushing boundaries, this felt safe, stale, and honestly boring. Maybe stop listening to your wife Bill? Save your time and revisit his older stuff instead. One star.",False
22,1,How is this getting 10s?,tontogringo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Bill Burr was always a genius. We've been to several of his shows. He can lose an audience (more so lately), and still bring them back a few minutes later.For this special, before the point he loses his audience, it is entertaining enough but only a couple laugh out loud moments. I get why he's ""sad"" now.This was the first special we stopped before it was done. It wasn't anything with politics. We were watching it late at night, it was supposed to be something fun and exciting, but it just turned slow, depressing, unrelatable, and most of all boring.My wife said it best, ""it's like watching a good podcast, that just went off the rails"".",False
23,3,It just wasn't funny,prrtt,n/a,15/08/2025,"It seems the older Bill gets the less funny he becomes. I liked Paper Tigers but it was the beginning of him slowing down so to speak. Red Rocks had his women in sports rant which was good but the rest of it wasn't funny to me.This special, I laughed very little to none at all. I think he's given up or lost the things that made him a big time comedian. Maybe it's his age, maybe it's his family, or maybe it's a combination of the two but clearly he doesn't approach comedy the way he used to. He's always done some political stuff but to me he's moving too far in that direction. You can say he attacks both sides of the aisle but I watch comedians with the hopes to get away from politics yet he wants to drag right back into it. I honestly just wish he would back off of it a little. Actually a lot. I think he spends too much time on it. Bill, you are not Dave Chapelle.",False
24,1,Not good,fdsafdsafd,n/a,15/08/2025,"I like his comedy usually but this falls flat. Cliche jokes and his subtle pandering is over played. Im really surprised because his podcast usually has some jokes here and there that I thought he used to build his act but none of this seems to work this time. I dont think I laughed once. Definitely his worst work Ive heard yet. Maybe he just phoned it in for the paycheck and this was just extra material? ?
Im starting to think it is his delivery that I found funny and not his material so much. The ideas in this one are not that edgy or original. Ive seen major comics when they are 'working out' new material and this is what it seems like because it is not polished work. Maybe hulu rushed him or he is just slipping with old age.",False
25,1,All about himself,Marcelo-Perroni,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was by far the worst Bill Burr special. I used to laugh my butt off with his stuff, but lately, he's lost it.The whole special is about himself, his wife and his kids.And how self-virtuous he is.Also, of course, how white people are terrible. But not him.He's probably going to co-author a book with Prince Harry: How A Black Chick Cut Off My Balls.Jokes were really not funny. Not even jokes. Just unfunny material about himself.I used to admire the guy. Now I can't stand anything he says.He totally lost it, and it's just a shame.I just hope some other talent comes around and takes this spot that is now vacant.",False

1,6,Not as thought provoking as I expected,Real_Mrs_JonSnow,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was looking forward to watching this. But as another reviewer said, it started out great then became uninteresting halfway in. I am not a republican, I'm definitely more liberal than anything. However, I too am tired of everything in the media having a far left view. This documentary wasn't any different. The experts were all so similar it became monotonous. I enjoy hearing different opinions, but unfortunately, no one is allowed to disagree anymore. No one is allowed to grow and learn from their mistakes, or even make mistakes in the first place. Once someone makes a remark that isn't liberal, they are unjustly punished by strangers and sometimes public figures on the internet. I was hoping we would hear more from the people who were unfairly cancelled and less repetitive points of view from the experts. I felt sympathy for the people who actually went through mass shaming online, and would have preferred to hear from more of them. There's plenty of them out there, our online society has become deplorable. Everyone is so angry and defensive, I wish they had tapped more into that aspect of it. There were some informative moments, but the rest was too dull to save it. This topic needs more than an hour and a half, it should have been a doc-series with more experts who have different thoughts and more interesting research and facts on the topic. They missed a great opportunity with this one.",False
2,6,Well Done but Suffers from its own Ambitions,mekjd,n/a,16/08/2025,"I stayed away from this film, thinking (wrongly) that its focus would be on its producer.Not so. The film attempts to encompass all of the issues that impact the use and misuse of online media, and how lives are affected by online behavior. My sense is that it would have been a better product had each facet of the online world been presented separately, in a series, with a wrap up at the end.Nonetheless, this was very well done and I will take away the names of resources featured.Notwithstanding that this documentary was in many respects a pleasant surprise, the none-too-subtle imagery attempting to link undesirable groups to a former president detracted from the film's overall theme.",False
3,6,Not as good nor as bad as many reviewers claim,dfloro,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst of all, Monica Lewinsky is hardly in this, other than some beginning & ending narration. Some reviewers need to get over that obsession. I've never seen ""Catfish,"" so know nothing of the filmmaker's other work. All of that said, this documentary definitely expresses a particular point of view, both by way of the experts that it interviews and the examples it highlights. (Its makers, for example, are sure no fans of Section 230 of the Communications Act.) That's not a bad thing, of course, as any work of creation reflects the creator(s), and seeking ""objectivity"" in almost any form of human endeavor is a fool's quest. But be forewarned: this film wears its biases on its sleeve and clearly favors some forms of Internet regulation, in general, and social media rules and guidelines, in particular. I think we need more and better explorations of ""cancel culture,"" ""cyber bullying"" and the like, so at least this is a sort of a start down that road.",True
4,10,People Ruin Everything,solojere,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Social media was a good idea, but people ruin everything,"" That pretty much sums up this documentary that looks into the dark side of social media and social shaming online. I think that this documentary is really important at our current moment in time where social media is such a huge part of our society. And honestly, it is scary because it seems like this public shaming could happen to anyone at any time, and it doesn't solve anything. It just furthers the current political divide. With that said, I think people should watch this and consider the effects of what we post online.",False
5,10,A good motivation to stop with all social networks.,the_real_smile,n/a,16/08/2025,"Personally, I stopped using all social networks about 10 years ago, even then I already thought wtf, but couldn't just quit get what is was.Till I saw this docu, and the sad realization then things became to complex came over me. People indeed think they do good by reposting something somebody did wrong, or do it just to insult someone, whatever the reason, bot and the social network algorithms make sure the news is shared to as many people as is can, just for the advertising income. People's suffering has become big business, just see this docu.I still do not think I miss 1 thing about social networks.",False
6,5,Strong Beginning But Fizzles Out,siesta-50845,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc had a lot of potential and had engaging subjects who were interviewed. But the overwhelming focus on ""experts"" - some of whom were nothing more than far-left grievance studies academics - really undermined what is an important discussion. The doc really loses its focus (cancel culture) towards the end and devolves into SJW pandering. Too bad. This could've been great.",False
7,10,The dark side of internet and toxic culture,sinsekihokimchiansusinkektiunpan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Internet has many usage, looking for information, meeting new people across the world and it's great.....at first. Over time the internet has become an ugly place. People saying mean things, trolling and threats. This documentary explore how ""the tool"" that was started great corrupt us and how those in power exploited the powerless in their greed.",False
8,5,Could have been great,laurazell,n/a,16/08/2025,"It started out strong with examples of internet shaming that are both recognizable and more nuanced than Twitter outrage allows us to explore. Remember the guy who bought all the hand sanitizer in early 2020? There are even some cultural psychologists who weigh in on human tendencies and behaviors and offered insightful commentary.Then, they brought in the gender studies experts. It all went downhill from there when they started explaining how women who get internet-shamed are victims of the patriarchy. Roxanne Gay weighed in to tell us it's not ""cancel culture,"" but is actually ""consequence culture."" Unless, of course you're a woman of color, then it's just racism.It's really too bad that it took the turn it did because it had such great potential to be objective and reflective.",False
9,10,Since when are film reviews a place for personal attacks?,jocelyn_2119,n/a,16/08/2025,"The people posting negative reviews with personal attacks on the creators are only validating the message of the documentary. I seriously doubt they watched this documentary or at the very least watched it and didn't want to hear it. This is, objectively, a well-done documentary with food for thought no matter your political stance.",False
10,10,Should Be Required Viewing For Youth,jrbrowzer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having been a journalist in a past life, I can tell you this documentary about shaming and trolling and the potential negative affects of our online behaviors upon others left me chilled. I've read the reviews on IMDB and they raise the same issues pointed to in this important documentary. That is we will take any steps further our opinions and proffer our points of view, and if we disagree with something we ""cancel"" it. I would applaud this being used as a tool within schools as to the real reason social media exists and how we are helping to build the wealth of mega-tech companies. Also, to teach the sometime consequences of our behaviors. This documentary made me think and question. Great viewing.",False
11,5,Downside of Public Shaming,chaitanyamaheshwari,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although made with good intentions, the documentary can't seem to find out what it wants to be. There are individual sections, addressing different aspects of online shaming, but all scattered and thus, it makes one see all of it through one eyeglass. It definitely could have been better.",False
12,1,What Nonsense Is This?,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"Chrissakes it completely figures this is the creation of Lewinski and the Catfish show recording guy- you can't disagree with a lot of what's presented but it's the manner in which it's presented.Media created this deep division and cancel culture and we just keep right on buying into it and helping them drive the divisive narrative.When you're reduced to having a GENDER STUDIES PROFESSOR as an 'expert', you've lost every ounce of credibility and employed someone whose only worthwhile achievement was getting a degree but the actual degree isn't worth the paper it's printed on.Someone needs to explore this topic with real experts who will do their due diligence without ridiculous confirmation bias clouding judgment.",False
13,1,Hard to take seriously,tamfiorella,n/a,16/08/2025,This could have been important content if it wasn't pushing a woman who saved a stained dress as a victim. I just couldn't get past that. She was an adult who knew exactly what she was doing. The internet is a mean place but she's no victim.,False
14,1,Max built his fame on public shaming,lisacc_,n/a,16/08/2025,Max wouldn't be interesting enough if he hadn't built his whole career on public shaming. Why would he direct anything that highlights public shame in a negative way as if his own public shaming behavior didn't actually happen.,False
15,1,"""People are still mean to me because I alone wasted multi millions of tax payer dollars in the 90s"" The Movie",secrective,n/a,16/08/2025,Theres an important issue with online hatred and harassment but this isnt the documentary to explore that issue. Monica selling herself over and over and over again. And over and over and over again. How many books? How many films now? Playing the victim while cashing the check.,False

1,2,"Puff piece to ease the awfulness of this person as ""King""",denesechristian-01167,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bottom line: Camilla was always his side piece; how can that be forgiven?Considering Diana's death, and Harry's and Meghan's departure, these tragedy's all due to Camilla!Is England now that deprived they would want her as ""Queen""?Imho, there should have been overthrow of ""Royal"" when it became public Charles and Camilla were together during Diana's marriage. The Monarchy should have been over THEN. Especially considering the ""heir"" is as despicable as his sire...Wow, congrats, another country being taken over by dotard: ""I want to make Britain great again""...and so it is; shame on us...",False
2,10,Insightful look into Charles!,teresan-84788,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was one of the many Americans (and probably Brits too) that wrote off Charles after what he did to Diana. I didn't think there was anything that would make me sympathize with him, but this really helped me see what he's really about and what formed his personality. This was a beautiful documentary that shows never-before-seen film clips and fascinating sound bites from the prince/king himself. I love hearing about his childhood and his goofy, spontaneous side. For sure, it's not easy being royalty. I think I'll cut him some slack...although he's not completely off the hook. Thanks Ron Nelson, for showing us the other side of Charles!",False

1,10,David attenborough is a literal legend,jordanparker16,n/a,17/08/2025,"Put his brain in a computer, we need wise david attenborough forever. Future generations take heed.",False
2,10,The Legend is Warning Us,farshidkarimi,n/a,17/08/2025,"Listen to him and pay attention to what he is saying.He is sending a stark message out to us all, human beings. Unbridled consumption, unchecked destruction of forests, pumping out tons of toxic fumes into the air, blatant consumerism, gross disregard for the nature and animals.I hope the World will take heed of his warning before it is too late.I wish the Legend a long life with great health.",False
3,10,The truth is sometimes painful.,gcbr-21023,n/a,17/08/2025,"In the UK. Take a look at what you have in regards to possessions and multiply that by 62million. Now multiply that by the whole of Europe. That's what we consume. Now add in a growing world population and then you realise the change that is required. Every four days a city the size of Manchester needs to be built to accommodate that surplus population. This is a wake up call. A change in the perception of wealth is needed.Fantastic, hard hitting and timely.",False
4,10,"At the beginning, I thought I was just watching another documentary",hicks-lau,n/a,17/08/2025,"At the beginning, I thought I was just watching another documentary. Soon, I started to realize, it's not a documentary. It's a horror movie. Not just a horror movie but a story of hopeless despair.May God save the world from human's hands, please save all the animals and forests from the greed and stupidity of human beings. This is a hell made by us. At the end of this mass extinction, we might probably be the last to go extinct. We really need to stop ourselves and get started to save the world... if it's not too late.",False
5,10,Excellent!,brendastap,n/a,17/08/2025,The interconnectedness of our world and the decisions we make and actions we take can no longer be ignored. Thank you for this documentary.,False
6,10,Heads in the sand,lovedongenaro,n/a,17/08/2025,I see the low score reviewers here firmly with their heads in the sand. One saying they don't believe in it and the other saying it's an angry old man. Embarrassingly dumb people.,False
7,6,important subject,SnoopyStyle,n/a,17/08/2025,"In the age of Covid-19, Sir David Attenborough and his friends examine the mass extinction taking place right now. It is one of the biggest extinction events threating biodiversity and possibly releasing other pandemics upon the world. This looks at some of the possible consequences and solutions.This is an important subject. It's deceptively simple and yet massive. It's hard to wrap your arms around it because there are a lot of different roads to take. I love the white rhino but the doc becomes scattered. This is basically an one hour presentation. There are lots of information that needs to go out. There's also a need for solutions. It becomes a lot of bromides and platitudes and complaints about the politics until they get to the gorillas. This is not going to convert anybody new or drive the hesitant into action. That's really the only measuring stick.",False
8,n/a,"Biased, and embarrassingly so misleading",n/a,n/a,17/08/2025,"This one has it all - stock footage that is no way related to the topic - being cleverly placed to mislead, input from ""experts"" that when you check their credentials reveals that they are activists, a study commissioned by the UN from *only one year ago* have determined that we're doomed. Ridiculous!It even has Al Gore's long-time discredited ""hockey stick graph"" lol And, to blame Cvid on global warming is completely discounted radical speculationAll the ""evidence"" is sourced to *computer models*, not facts, and there are zero interviews or input from anyone that disagrees with its conclusions.Nonsense. Not a doc, but activist infomercial.",False

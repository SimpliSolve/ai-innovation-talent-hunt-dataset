1,10,Hooked Instantly,lesleybowers,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is heartbreaking and eye opening. It helps bring awareness to the historical timeline of homelessness in the US and how rapidly it has changed and grown. It highlights the root causes, which seem to be vastly overlooked and misunderstood by our country. There are real solutions for these problems and this documentary sheds light on that with the truest intent to spread awareness and ignite a movement to help solve this very real problem. The movie was so well produced and edited that it draws you in immediately and is chalked full of information. I really hope this is seen by millions.",False

Clear and concise statistics presented alongside personal stories that will enlighten the public to the disparity we have created in the United States. Highly recommend watching and maybe even taking notes, because there's a lot you'll want to remember and repeat in conversation later on.",False
4,10,Hard to understate the importance of this film,mbrezinski-92114,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a must watch, both for professionals working in the field and for anyone who wonders why the problem of homelessness seems to be getting worse. Through interviews with persons currently experiencing homelessness and the public health workers who are out there every day, the filmmakers do the important and difficult job of humanizing a systemic problem. The historical analysis of US housing law provides a container for understanding how we, as a nation, have arrived at this point, and the discussion of current anti-homelessness laws provides a context for the conversations we need to have as we look toward a future where these issues will only grow thornier if action is not taken soon.",False

9,10,This is an ESSENTIAL film for everyone.,hallieallex,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is so well-rounded in its coverage of such a complex condition of structural oppression. It breaks down the history/politics, current band-aid and often harmful solutions, recognizes our unhoused neighbors as the experts and the intersectionality of it all. As my friend in life and work says, everyone can find a way to relate to homelessness.",False
10,10,Heart warming and heart breaking at the same time,whymsical_me,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie touched me to the core. At the age of 17, I was homeless and I can relate to so much of the emotional, physical, and psychological parts of the journeys these men and women were experiencing. We are all aware of homeless, but it is something many just push to the side and don't want to think about because it's not our problem. It is America's problem and we as Americans need to press forward and help to make awareness nationwide so that it isn't just brushed under the rug. Being a good humanitarian always plays forward and I am on the bandwagon with Josh to help those who want and need help. Nobody in our great country should ever be without a place to live or have food in their stomachs. Great movie, great motivation!!",False

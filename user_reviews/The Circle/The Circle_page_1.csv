1,6,A surprising but unstructured little documentary,cookie666,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let me say off the bat that by no means is this a perfect documentary - we don't get much insight into the (former) lives of the subjects, very little background information about the context and the location and not even much insight into how they live their daily lives (they're filming a sustainable green community but there is virtually no insight into their green practices or way of life).As the title implies, the documentary focuses more on the people and their complicated relationships. The approach taken is very subtle and everything is filmed naturally, as is, there are no ""video confessions"" or interviews with partcipants or anything like that - only what they talk about naturally. While this is not a bad approach per se, it left a few gaps - some revelations were unexpected and I didn't always understand why people felt the way they did, so at least some interviews or coordinated insight into their feelings would've been nice.All in all, it's an interesting watch but I was missing a few of the above mentioned things - better narration and more structure. 6/10.",False

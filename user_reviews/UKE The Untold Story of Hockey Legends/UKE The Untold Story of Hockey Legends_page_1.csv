1,10,A well-researched love letter to Ukraine and the sport of hockey.,caramac82,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary is essential viewing for any hockey lover.We are introduced to some of the greats while learning of their heritage and hearing some previously untold stories.,False
2,8,UKE is for Ukrainians,Aira_Noir,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary film is far from being described as ""about hockey"". There is no need to be a fan of this sport to be able to enjoy it. It's a story about journeys of different Ukrainian families through ages of history and continents-apart distances. Families that left their homeland to be able to survive or to finally feel themselves free. Years later it will allow them to left their mark in history by entering the list of greatest hockey players ever, while also remembering and respecting their roots.I'd rather say it's more of a project than a single documentary film. Filming team did a great job creating a whole series of interviews with hockey stars of Ukrainian origin and their family members. Each segment is reasonably short, yet truly personal and deep.Films like that are necessary for Ukraine nowadays as never before. Invasion of russia made millions of Ukrainians refugees once again. Both inside the country and abroad. A huge amount of them will return to their homes after our victory. Others will represent other countries in the future, but will also remember their roots. The new stars are rising.",False
3,10,Pedigree. Emigration. Sport,yarovoyeduard-20573,n/a,16/08/2025,"You look at the elderly and envy with white envy how people can live in old age. Heroization and perpetuate achievements, recognition in society. I was surprised by more than one sports documentary. But it's not about that. This is about Ukrainians, about our code. UNR, Canada and the Stela Cup - this is the mix of this work.I can't even imagine how many stages and difficulties the team went through. There are 4 episodes of how they filmed on YouTube. But I understand how difficult it is. The quality is really cool, no wonder it's being shown on Amazon Prime now. Derzhkino's share of financing is 4.6 uah million from the total bill of 5.76 uah million.This is just such a strong combination for me. Pedigree. Emigration. Sport. I strongly recommend it.",False

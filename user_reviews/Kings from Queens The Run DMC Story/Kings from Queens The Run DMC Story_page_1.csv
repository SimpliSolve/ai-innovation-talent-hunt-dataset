1,8,It's like that,jamesjustice-92,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've discovered Run DMC at the dawn of my musical development, the first song I heard was probably Tougher than leather from their eponymous 1988 album and I remember liking it instantly. I was head deep in rock music back then and this blend of hip-hop and rock broke ground for me to inhale something different and boy after that the flood of Run DMC songs took me over just like that (what?) and that's the way it was.Their story is a story of success, the popularization of the new genre when they shook the world in 1984, how they changed the game and opened the gates to tons of new music artists and genres. Without DJ Run, DMC and Jam Master Jay there wouldn't be no gangsta rap, no rap rock, no alternative metal, no nu metal and no artists of said genres. They were the kings.This little 2,5 hour documentary tells us their story and how it was back in the day. Touching interviews, pieces of shows, music and the final bowdown present the full account of events that happened in lives of those three great people from Hollis, Queens, how they got together and their mutual desire to make music, to follow their dreams and just do what they do best - and by doing just that they made this world a better place to live in.The music of Run DMC is a part of my life, as much as many others' on this planet, it resonates with people, makes them want to rock out and rhyme along. Their music is timeless. They don't make no songs like these, period.",False
2,8,Great Documentary,peacecrew-93000,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGreat Documentary of how three brothers from Hollis had changed the game through the image, music, rhymes, and sound of hip hop. They show how it is an example of what society had envied and copied the art that black people had created. Not just hip hop but all the genres that black people created. Run DMC mad props! By the way geography wise when DMC says tri-state area. Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island is not part of the tri-state area. The tri-state area is New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut only. From Maine to the District Of Columbia is the Northeast US of the east coast.ðŸ¤˜",True
3,10,3 Special Men that created something Unique,allismile,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely have loved Run DMC since I was a 9 year old in 1984 and was introduced to ""Rum DMC""- I wasn't into heavy metal and most of the music I loved was melodic and rock driven. Run DMC reached me because they had a melodic rock driven sound with a heavy metal attitude to my perspective.I've seen other documentaries about Run DMC, but this one really covers so much about who they were as individuals- I especially felt I learned more about Daryl Mac than ever before- his openness about who he really is shines so clearly in this doc that you have to love and admire a man who was such a natural introvert but brought his inner world and shared it with all of us. But that's the magic of any great band- each member bringing something unique and different to the table making something totally unique fresh and relatable.This doc did a wonderful job of expressing who they were as men and what Run DMC has meant to the world.",False

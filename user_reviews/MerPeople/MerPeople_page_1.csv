1,7,You had all the best Merfolk right there?!?!,salamane,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off that silly drama in scene one does more to hurt the Mermaid industry than I can even begin to get into here. Such silly drama, and can totally get us banned from local pools by concerned parents. So thanks Netflix.Second, you had some of the best and most interesting Merfolk right there! Hannah at your fingertips, and you barely talked to her. Look I'm sure Sparkles is lovely, but I want to have an hour talking to Hannah!!Also soooo Mertailor centric. Frankly kinda rude to the other makers that you gave so very much time to just this one artist. Finfolk is clearly the other half of that particular level if mercrafting, and you didn't even toss them a mention let alone get a second perspective on the industry.Honestly the best part was seeing the older Weeki mermaids, and their talent and joy.",False
2,6,No dead Mermaids,jessicatinkerakers,n/a,16/08/2025,"A good collection of stories, and they followed the MerPeople chosen from start to finish. But it was poorly edited and some things got left on the cutting room floor.Overall 6/10 because bad editing cuts the audience interest.I give the stories 8.9/10 because they did do a good job of showcasing all the variety and being honest.I mean, who didn't dream of being a Mermaid? I think anyone who did should watch this. I support the dreams of bringing more beauty into this world, and MerPeople do that and this documentary showcases how the dreamers never give up.Be Fintastic, Be Mermazing!!",False
3,5,More skill diversity,neelysarahlyn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wish there were more of diversity in skill level and not just ELITE groups. No one mentioned Fin Fun, Finfolk, Vancouver mermaid, Sparklegirlcostume, Jurassicmerman, ETC. There are a lot more tail makers. This documentary is mainly focused on mertailor being the best tail maker and Circus Siren Pod as the best performance group. They should look more into all skill levels and resources for each state and around the world. There are merpeople all over the world! Each state has their pods (groups) who plan get together and events. The conventions that happen like Illinois sunset convention, mermagic con, California mermaid convention, afro mermaid convention, flordia spring splash. This land locked plus size mermaid loves the idea but show more skill diversity and tailmakers. Not just ELITE groups.",False
4,n/a,I was today year's old when I learned there was a merpeople industry.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler... and I'm instantly invested in everyone! I'm not even a huge mermaid fan but I watched this because a friend recommended it and I was hooked. This docuseries does a great job spotlighting people you care about, and you want to see them succeed. Four episodes almost felt too short to dive deep (no pun intended) into their subject matter!I hope they consider making a season 2 where they spotlight some of the pros in their industry. Some of the judges and even contestants from the competition in Episode 4 were really fascinating, and I'd love to see more of them. For example, William (the Merman from Hawaii) was spotlighted in a few talking heads, but it seems like he's been a pro at this for a while and I wonder what that's like. The series right now does a good job of focusing on people who want to get into this industry, but I actually want to know about guys like him (and some others) who seem like they've been in this industry longer. Just to get that balance!Anyway, if you're on the fence about watching this one, definitely give it a watch. I hope you fall in love with these merpeople as much as I did!",True
5,7,Overall Okay!,baraticaitlyn,n/a,16/08/2025,It definitely had its moments but considering this is the first merfolk documentary I would have loved to have seen more about tail safety and swim safety. Definitely would've loved to have seen more about other tail creators and their stories on how they got into this business and what the future holds for them and the community they've created and not just Mertailor and follow more stories on mers who are out trying to make positive impacts on the environment. There are so many amazing merpeople out there that I feel like should have been interviewed and they weren't. Hopeful for a season 2 so these things have a chance to be addressed.,False
6,8,I never knew before :D,keikoyoshikawa,n/a,16/08/2025,"If someone had told me when I was a kid that I could one day become a professional mermaid, I probably would have said yes! :DThis short series is actually eye-opening and now that I know more about it, definitely I would not be a professional mermaid. Not that it's not cool - it is. But the level of athletic ability needed to be one is high.The series follow a few of these talented performers / swimmers, showing us what it takes to do what they do. It's not easy. And there are definitely down sides, some of them dangerous.We also get to meet some of the artists who make mermaid tails and personal aquariums. Honestly, if I could afford it, I would get one, fill it with small fishes, and swim with them. :DBeing a professional mermaid or merman is a niche job, a life-style, and a passion. It's not for everyone, and that's super ok.",False
7,1,"Pretty Shallow People Here, Absolutely a Cringe worthy experience, Bad Behavior gets rewarded..",kkirchemshk,n/a,16/08/2025,"This Docu drama just Benefited the so called Elite, Elite in Narcissism, there are many other people in the Merfolk community including tail makers Omitted. Think of mermaiding as a Version of RuPauls Drag Race with all the Cattiness and meanness included.. This isn't the community that builds you up, But readily Tears you apart, those featured have a shady past, Salty Merfolk get rewarded..there is a shady past with All MerCons, why have so many MerCons have come and gone? Why are the merfolk communities fragmented ?? Especially Minorities?? The Pettiness would surprise you.. this was all about Me,Me,Me.. you should see the featured people in their instagram pages, Narcissism overload..The Pageant''s are Joke, king and Queen of Egos LMAO!!! Just a Poor/Bad representation of the merfolk community.. It Shouldn't be no dead mermaids, But just give me all you're money, screw you, you don't matter.. team Building isn't in the Merpeople vocabulary.. But Gatekeeping and Exclusion is... Ugh...",False
8,9,Well done but needs more episodes!,mermaidmarla,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a well done docuseries showing some of the aspects of professional merpeople, but definitely scripted stories. There are so many more true stories out there to be told. This 4-part series barely scratches the surface of this culture. I would love to see episodes on the merpeople who concentrate on ocean conservation, teaching kids and young adults how to become ocean stewards and so many international merpeople that should be featured! They are many talented tail makers that should also be featured and each mer-convention, beginning with the first one in Las Vegas, could be featured. I really hope more seasons are added as this first season doesn't show what the vast majority of merpeople are all about.",False
9,10,Such an emotional ride!,mrpauloldham,n/a,16/08/2025,"The intro took my breath away. The triumphs and realness of the merpeople stole my heart.I have been a fan of mermaids forever. These stories deserve to be told and I loved every minute of it! I wish there could have been 6, 8, or 20 episodes because I was fascinated the entire time.We watched all four episodes in the span of two days and we are now following all the people on social media!I wish we had gotten to know some of the other mermaids featured. They all looked amazing and a lot of fun. I want to meet more nonwhite non-skinny merpeople.Seriously Netflix, you had better give us more mermaid content please.",False
10,1,Absolute garbage,atleverton,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a decidedly middle-aged man. Most of the time, this is a fact which I am able to ignore. But sometimes I watch something or someone says something and I realize that this is not the world in which I was born. I cannot comprehend why this documentary exists, are people out there who really want to be mermaids professionally? That is to say, I do not believe there are people who want to pretend to be mermaids professionally. But the tone of this absolute piece of garbage suggests that this is a growing and wild phenomenon. I doubt it. But it may just be my age that I had not heard of the merpeople subculture before. The other elephant, or mermaid in the room as it were, is the fact that there is nothing quirky about this documentary. It has a sort of flat and uninteresting tone. There's no pushback from the documentary makers when their subjects make claims which are ambiguously truthful. In the hands of a more skilled documentarian, this would be a treat, but what is actually portrayed on the screen is the equivalent of shoving chopsticks into your eyeballs. I would avoid this at all costs.",False
11,9,More entertaining than I thought,PunkynPye,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't think this series would hold my attention, going into it, but decided to keep an open mind and give it a whirl. After all, I enjoy documentaries, and I watched Tiger King, so surely I could sit through 4 episodes learning about mermaids. I'm so glad I did! I found it much more entertaining than I would have guessed. I would never have dreamed how extensive this whole world is! There's a whole community that have dedicated their lives to living life like a mermaid, for various reasons. This includes film footage from the 60s, from the OG mermaids, which I found very interesting. Like almost any series produced recently, I feel like it could have been edited down a bit more, but I still enjoyed it.",False
12,8,Captures an authentic glimpse of this beautifully unique and sparkly subculture,kristencorpion,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well done documentaries allow viewers an unvarnished and unscripted glimpse into an unknown world. Usually the more salacious, shocking, and scary, the more naturally compelling a subject, which is why documentaries tend to drift into and shed light on the macabre. In a world overrun with dark documentaries (don't get me wrong, I like those too), MerPeople gets it right by shining the light on and calling our attention to something as positive and all American as Apple Pie. Something, dare I say, sparkly? Yes, sparkly and fabulous Apple Pie.Without stepping on the shoulders of political scandal, dark crime, or other sinister low hanging fruit, MerPeople fascinates and spellbinds the viewer. Why? MerPeople allows viewers an authentic look at a quirky and fun subculture that has developed and is still developing. The Mer subculture rests on a foundation that most people can stand by and root for: inclusion, diversity, and celebrating being your authentic self.I was Mer ignorant before watching the show. Had know idea that this subculture existed with such prevalence. After watching and meeting the likes of Blix, Che, and Sparkles I feel compelled to root for these Mers. And I also feel a strong sense of protectionism. Ready to stand as a Mer ally against the Cool Kids who, fueled by their own insecurity and self loathing, will likely take cheap shots at this group of happy merpeople who were all brave and secure enough in who they are to allow us viewers a glimpse into their inner world. You won't find me putting on a tail any time soon (probably not ever, because I am simply not a sparkly or fabulous person), but I will happily cheer and root for this group of authentic people living their best happy sparkle filled lives.This documentary is a fun, family friendly watch! Recommend checking it out and checking your judge-y insecure High School Cool Kid ego at the door. Kudos to the creators. It's really nice to see everyday people who are simply enjoying life getting the spotlight, as opposed to psychos committing criminal deeds.(Notes for the creative team and other producers who, yeah, should absolutely read my epic reviews. Great job with this one. I am ready for more content! Suggestion: a separate documentary spinoff on how those tails are made! Seems like a goldmine of really interesting content about the business side of things and also it seems like there are a good number of vendors out there competing with MerTailor (who was a supercool company to feature). Second recommendation, please do dive into more quirky fun subcultures filled with interesting and dynamic people pursuing their passions. Super interesting and fun to watch. Well done!)",False
13,8,I was Mermazed!,morgencrossland,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shello! To keep it short and sweet, this show was a surprise all around for me! I don't think I really knew what I was in for when I started watching it and I couldn't turn it off. I obviously enjoyed learning more about the world of Mers and had no idea it even existed. Outside of the fun vocabulary, I actually loved to see the diversity, and joy these folks have in their spaces! Especially because it shined a light on a group of individuals that are living their authentic selves. At times it can be uncomfortable because of how out of the box it all seems, but I think it's important to have perspective switches and discomfort as it can broaden your horizons. This certainly did!I rated it an 8 only because I felt some of the stories were rushed.",False
14,10,The art and talent of MerPeople,sd-09951,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this series and seeing an in depth look into the art, talent and dangers of being a professional merperson.I think so many children are mesmerized and would love to be a mermaid (when they grow up), but this shows the reality and hard work it would take.Like any performing arts discipline, being a professional entertainer takes hard work, endurance, risks, sacrifice and a passion to follow your heart and pursue the life you find in your heart along with other like minded artists that become family.MerPeople embraces artists celebrating their joy of underwater arts for all, colors, sizes and genders.What a way to live!",False
15,10,"Celebrating Creativity, Self-Expression & Self-Discovery",mermazinggame,n/a,16/08/2025,"We need more positive, reality shows like this! I had no idea that mermaiding was so popular! I have a new respect for the SPORT of it and those that pursue an entertainer's career to inspire ""play"", creativity, & ocean conservation! WOW!!! I thought the show was light-hearted, fun, and very real. I wish there were more episodes, as the director gave a wonderful introduction to the mermaid/men community. I know that there are so many layers as to why a person would choose to live a mermaid lifestyle-- but all of the 'characters' featured were an absolute delight to watch. There was mild drama, more heart, and lots of beauty! Please release another Season Netflix!",False
16,10,So exciting!!,gerri-50188,n/a,16/08/2025,"So magical and I loved learning about these peoples lives. It ended so quickly I wanted more!! I never knew how big their community is and I love how accepting they are to all people. Seeing their perspective on everything was so eye opening. I also just enjoy watching the performers do what they love. It is an art form. Sparkles, Morgana and Blixunami were my favorites. Even though some had trials and tribulations they always pushed through and gave it with so much passion I loved the character development and climaxes! I would be so happy if the renewed the show for a second season! Definitely would be watching!",False
17,10,Fintastic!,ashaktihakim,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoy watching documentaries about little known (to me) cultures, lifestyles, hobbies, etc and this one was a blast. It was fascinating to learn about people who are passionate about ""mermaiding"" and the lengths they'll go to follow those passions.Each mermaid & merman had a story that was intriguing, heartfelt, and insightful. I appreciated the diversity that was highlighted as well, like the plus size mermaids and the Black mermaids & mermen.I would've liked to learn more about other mermaid pods and mer-tailors as only one of each was highlighted. I would've also enjoyed more episodes as it seems there are more stories to tell or maybe going deeper into the merpeople who were highlighted?Either way, this was fun to watch & I applaud people who identify & pursue their passions, regardless of how outlandish it might seem to others.",False
18,10,We need a season 2,apavacich,n/a,16/08/2025,"My daughter and I LOVE this show! We have recently visited the Mertailor and had the best experience, they need a show just for them! Such amazing people and they care so much about the sealife. My daughter had me buy her a mermaid tail and can't wait to start mermaid lessons! If you have not watched season one you should binge it now! It's a must watch! While we love Ariel, the Mertailor is a close second. We are looking forward to watching these mer stories continue and we support a Mertailor spinoff. If you are local it's a must see place, stop in and touch a stingray, and watch the show! Love mermaids!",False
19,10,More fantasy artists should do this!,Mare_Queen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Funny how this came out close to Disney little mermaid release, my whole problem is that this is a live movie I would have loved to see a real underwater performance but for sure Disney wouldn't risk their team nor spend money or bring someone who isnt as famous as big stars, sure CGI if done right which wasn't done right gives releastic image and keeps everyone safe but I want to see real people working hard with costume designed beautiful tails and risk their life to give us realistic show, they show their love for mermaids through their show and the underwater performance is something else.The thing I loved most they do talk about risks, they do talk how some struggle and it's not a successful life for everyone and it's not always happy life even if they enjoy it, some still need side jobs to survive living, some get sick overworking, as a young artist myself who loves making fantasy creations I often get dispointed looking at other successful artists and end up with so many questions, are they really successful? Do they earn enough or do they have to get other jobs? How did they even get there and continue? What if they live in country like mine where not many perfome fantasy creations how did they survive? Some artists are selfish and dislike helping young ones or even destroy which is sad it happened to me once, so I'm glad they tried to share everything and maybe even gave chance for many to get some recognition through this series.It would be great if rest of artists communties inside fantasy share their experience to help us young artists join in and learn.",False

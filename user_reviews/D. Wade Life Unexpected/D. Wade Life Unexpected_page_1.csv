1,7,"Not bad, but generic and lacking focus despite having good elements",guisreis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dwayne Wade's life indeed provides elements for a good film: his poor childhood in dangerous Chicago periphery, with police menacing him, his mother sinking in drugs, hunger always very close. That is interesting and important, although melodrama tone was not the desirable aesthetic option in my opinion. Then, there appear the NCAA success, the fatherhood, the draft. Everything still nice, but serming lacking focus. Afterwards, there is the judicial problems with ex wife, the rapprochement with parents, the career as free agent, and life with his second wife. The movie which began more promising unfortunately becomes extremely generic and unfocused. By the way, amazing T-shirt dressed by Udonis Haslem! The horror of Chicago police being exposed again, after Wade's move to his hometown Bulls, was nice too.",False

3,1,Barely about basketball,petermarkfrancis,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to watch a basketball documentary about D. Wade, this isn't it, there is more nonsense about his private life & woke narratives than basketball itself...",False

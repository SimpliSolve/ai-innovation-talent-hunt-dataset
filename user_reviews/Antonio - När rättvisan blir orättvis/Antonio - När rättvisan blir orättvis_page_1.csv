1,1,A Disgrace to the Documentary Genre,ligren,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary disaster that fails on almost every level.The film, which claims to examine the legal process surrounding Antonio Toledano Book, son of artist Anna Book, is nothing more than an attempt to manipulate the audience's emotions.Director Pontus ""Anjo"" Björlund calls himself YouTube's Janne Josefsson, but has zero understanding of basic journalistic principles.Instead of an objective investigation, we are given a one-sided narrative filled with interviews from Antonio's family and friends, without a single critical voice or opposing perspective. The result is an unbalanced and unprofessional production that is more propaganda than serious documentary.From a technical standpoint, the film leaves much to be desired. The editing is amateurish, the sound quality is inconsistent, and the visual style is dull. It's hard to believe this production was released in 202 - it feels more like a failed school project.In conclusion, it's a documentary (in the loosest sense of the word) best avoided; it's amateurish both journalistically and technically, it offers nothing new and nothing insightful.Your time would be better spent on other more well-made and objective documentaries.",False
2,1,A biased and awful documentary,RealRask,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pontus Björlund's documentary ""Antonio"" is a prime example of how good intentions can be utterly derailed by poor execution. From the very beginning, the film feels disjointed and self-indulgent, more like a vanity project than a genuine attempt to tell a compelling story. The pacing is painfully slow, and the narrative lacks any coherent structure, leaving viewers wondering what the point of it all is.The documentary's biggest flaw is its blatant bias. Instead of presenting a balanced perspective, it feels like a one-sided rant, with Pontus using the platform to air personal grievances rather than explore meaningful themes. The decision to publicly expose the plaintiff (målsägande uthängd) comes off as vindictive and unprofessional, undermining any credibility the film might have had. It's hard to take the documentary seriously when it feels more like a personal vendetta than a piece of art.Technically, the film is a mess. The editing is choppy, the sound quality is inconsistent, and the visuals are uninspired. It's clear that the production was rushed, and it shows in every frame. The interviews feel staged, and the emotional moments come across as forced, making it difficult to connect with the subject matter on any level.To make matters worse, the media and public backlash surrounding the film's release only highlights its shortcomings. Rather than sparking meaningful conversation, ""Antonio"" has become a cautionary tale of how not to make a documentary. It's a shallow, self-serving project that fails to deliver on every front.In short, ""Antonio"" is a tedious, poorly made film that offers little value to its audience. Save yourself the time and skip this one.",False
3,1,Terrible production an biased.,toreyfinnley,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had very little hopes for this movie but was nervertheless extremely dissapointed. The edidting is terrible and the audio as well. Regarding the research there is none. The filmmaker Pontus is friends with the mother of the perpetrator and his source of information is documents from the investigation with her remarks and highlights why she think her son is innocent. Alot of misleading therories are presented based on hearsay and at least one crusial testimony was left out, pointing in the same direktion as the solid verdict. I would say that you should save two hours of your life and stay away from this garbage. It is not a documentary.",False
4,1,Biased and under investigation,imdbkritiker,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie seems to have been created as a friendly favour between the filmmaker and the family of one of the convicted men (the man whom the film is named after). The movie is biased in favour of this convicted man, and the film wishes to portray this perpetrator as the victim.The Swedish Court of Appeal has decided that the real victim's name should be kept confidential. Despite this, the movie contains sequences where the victim's name can be identified. The trailer of this film also contained the plaintiffs name in plain sight.The plaintiff has reported the filmmaker of this movie to the Swedish authorities - the movie and the filmmaker is currently under criminal investigation. Myself, and many others, have hopes that this movie will be taken down to prevent further speculations and misinformation about the case, and that the filmmaker will face legal consequences for publishing confidential information about the victim. The plaintiff - the real victim of this crime - should have been given the decency and the privacy needed (and decided by Swedish Courts) to have time and space in order to heal.",False
5,1,Biased movie spreading misinformation,nystromlouise,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the very beginning of the movie it is clear that they want to show a convicted perpetrator as a victim. The so called documentary is filled with misinformation about the case and throughout the movie they constantly try to undermine the witness to the awful crime and make her sound less believable.This movie and its trailer has shown the name of the victim. A young girl who didn't even want this movie to be made.Showing her name is illegal and making a movie against her will, defending her perpetrator is just wrong.I can't even believe how someone thought this movie was a good idea. It's filled with misinformation and shows no respect at all for the real victim.",False
6,1,Give me my money back,fannykajsa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I do not know where to start...
Perhaps the most unforgivable aspect is how it treats the real victim. The documentary goes out of its way to discredit a key witness, making her seem less believable, while simultaneously portraying the convicted perpetrator as a victim. Even worse, the victim's name is shown despite her opposition to this film, a blatant disregard for both her privacy and the law.This is not an unbiased investigation. It's a reckless and disrespectful piece of media that distorts facts to push a specific narrative. If you value truth and ethical storytelling, save yourself two hours and skip this one.",False
7,1,A Case Study in Poor Documentary Filmmaking,johankarlssona,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary in question fails on multiple levels, making it difficult to engage with or even fully comprehend the case it attempts to present. The editing is disjointed, creating a confusing narrative structure that lacks coherence. Compounding this issue, the sound design is inconsistent, with fluctuating volume levels that further disrupt the viewing experience.As a media student, I can confidently say that a project of this quality would not meet the basic standards required to pass an academic evaluation. The fact that this was produced by someone who presents themselves as a serious documentary filmmaker is almost astonishing. If anything, this serves as an example of what not to do in documentary production.In my media class, our teacher used this film as a case study not to highlight effective storytelling, but to illustrate the pitfalls of poor craftsmanship. It was difficult to take seriously, and it ultimately became a source of amusement rather than education. A documentary should inform, engage, and maintain professional technical standards. Unfortunately, this one accomplishes none of those things.",False
8,1,Terrible documentary,andersmacmusik,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is totally biased and in Antonio's favor, an attempt to clear his name, unfortunately it turned out to be gut-wrenching, and extremely distasteful. An almost 2 hour long documentary about a rapist who cries out, who seems to be a horrible person, not a word about the victim and how she has felt after this, Pontus who created the documentary received legitimate criticism before the film and now that it has been released it turns out that the criticism was crystal clear, making a documentary about a rapist who cries out is not only distasteful but totally insane. The fact that Pontus completely embarrassed himself in interviews before the release is also a strong sign of how little he actually knows about the case. This documentary is so bad I hope you don't waste your time watching it.",False
9,1,"A Superficial Examination of the Justice System: Completely Misses the Point""",Natalie_Flashbackdotter,n/a,16/08/2025,"**Defamation?**A's friend, R, is mentioned by name in the film and is alleged to have committed a crime. Even if something is true, such as a person being convicted of a crime, it can still constitute defamation if it is not justifiable to publish the information about the crime/conviction.However, this requires that the person is identified in some way, meaning mentioned by name and/or shown in a picture. In the documentary, Anna Book states that R has changed their name and moved on. The film discloses R's former name. The question then becomes whether this is actually an identification-since the real name today is different from the one mentioned in the film.On the other hand, the event described is so distinct that it is easy for practically anyone to trace the conviction and, from there, find out who it refers to today. For instance, a name change is listed on Mr. Koll.If it is an identification despite the name change, the question is whether it is justifiable to dig up a conviction from several years ago and state that someone has been convicted of a crime. Typically, this is not considered justifiable. Moreover, R is not a public figure, a person in power, or something similar (I assume). Such individuals are expected to tolerate more publicity than an unknown ""man/woman on the street""-making it easier to argue that it is justifiable to publish.Therefore, the questions of whether an identification has occurred and whether it was justifiable are key factors in determining whether it constitutes defamation in this case.As for A, there are no issues. He participates in the film and presents his version of events.Anna Book mentions something about the key witness that could be interpreted negatively, but not in a way that constitutes defamation.The victim is not identified by name (if I've noted correctly), and is not directly criticized, nor is the key witness, who is mentioned by name, although it can be inferred between the lines that Anjo makes a significant point about whether her testimony was truly reliable. Thus, no defamation there either.**Criticism of the Preliminary Investigation**The film reveals that the police were on-site and took pictures, but they took pictures of the wrong location. Someone questions what is actually in the ""slasken"" (trash folder) and whether it could have made a difference to the outcome of the case. Anjo criticizes the interview techniques of the investigator during the questioning of the victim (""leading questions"").There are always things to criticize in a preliminary investigation, including whether enough has been done and whether what has been done has been done correctly (ask any defense lawyer!). However, the criticism Anjo raises about the investigation seems like minor details in this context: Pictures were taken at the wrong location, but even if the police had taken the ""right"" pictures, it would not have affected the verdict, for example.Leading questions in police interrogations with victims are certainly not ideal. From what is presented in the film, there is no doubt that leading questions were asked, and, as Anjo points out, one gets the impression that the interrogating officer had already decided on the guilt.However, this plays a lesser role in this particular case since the victim claimed not to remember much about the event-the witness testimony became decisive in the case.**Overview of the District Court Verdict**A states that he admitted knowing that the victim was 13 years old, which was to his disadvantage. R claimed not to know the age, but thought she was over 15.Anjo makes a point of this, and Anna Book also states that ""everyone, even me,"" knows the age of all those involved. The people involved said that R knew the victim was under 15, so why wasn't he disproven? This question is raised in the film.The thing is, witnesses are valuable to describe what someone has done, how they physically acted, etc. But a witness statement that ""he knows this and that"" is not very valuable against someone's denial, since you cannot just jump into someone else's mind.Such a statement from someone about what a person ""actually knows"" is not worth much. It is necessary for the person to have concretely demonstrated their knowledge, for example by saying that they know the age or writing it down. No such concrete demonstration of R's knowledge about the age appears in the film.Furthermore, Anjo claims that R does not remember exactly what he did, but is acquitted despite the witness testimony, while A, who denied doing anything, is convicted.R's acquittal in the district court for child rape was due to the court finding that he lacked intent regarding the victim's age. But how can he then be convicted of ""just"" rape in the court of appeal? Anjo asks.**Overview of the Court of Appeal Verdict**Anjo here gets caught in a complicated reasoning about the age and the accused's knowledge of the age, and its significance for the crime committed. It's under 15 here and consent between those over 15 there, and so on.Anjo notes that in the court of appeal, the verdict was rape, not child rape, for R, which Anjo finds strange:If he didn't know the victim was under 15, it became ""just"" rape instead. But the victim said she wanted to be with R, and this is where consent comes in, consent which doesn't matter if the victim is under 15, as those under 15 cannot legally consent to sex.What Anjo misses is a detail in the court of appeal ruling:In the court of appeal, the prosecutor dropped the charge of child rape against R and instead only sought responsibility for rape. According to the reasoning of the court of appeal, the victim was so intoxicated that, in the eyes of the law, she could not be considered capable of giving consent (regardless of her real or R's presumed age), which R must have realized.That's why he was convicted of rape. This means that even if the victim had been 15 or older, R would have been convicted of rape due to the severe intoxication.As for A, the matter was clear in the court of appeal as well: He knew that the victim was 13.**Witnesses**A main theme in the film is the witness testimony; as stated, it was decisive in the case. There is discussion of so-called hearsay, partly conflicting testimonies, and a lawyer demonstrating their knowledge of the subject.None of this is particularly unusual. Many cases, particularly sexual assault cases, rely heavily on oral testimony that can make the difference between acquittal and conviction. The court makes an overall assessment of the statements provided. In this case, the key witness is still sure of their story-both then and now, as shown in Anjo's phone interview with her.In that interview, Anjo shows his own talent for asking leading questions (apparently, not just the police engage in such things): ""Could it be that...""; ""But maybe it was that she didn't have it in her mouth?"" and similar.**Summary**The film claims to examine the legal system using this case as an example. While it is a commendable ambition, as Anjo says at the end, the legal system is not perfect, it has its flaws, which we all in the field know-no one is infallible, even judges and police are, believe it or not, just human, and so on.But from my perspective, the film misses its own point: In the case discussed, Anjo fails to convincingly show an example of structural flaws in the legal system.",False
10,1,Terrible movie,MagmysMark,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is definitely not for everyone. I thought I was signing up for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to admire Anjo's Anna or Antonio's glorious belly because let's be honest, it's a long film, and what else would they fill the runtime with? But no. Instead, I got a cinematic dumpster fire that somehow manages to mock a child victim while glorifying a convicted rapist.So, in summary: I paid good money expecting premium belly content and instead got a morally bankrupt mess. Zero stars. Would rather watch paint dry on Antonio's belly. I would not recommend this movie even to my worst enemy.",False
11,1,A poorly executed documentary that fails both technically and journalistically,romochkola,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie ""Antonio - När rättvisan blir orättvis"" is a biased and unprofessional production best described as a poorly executed documentary that fails both technically and journalistically.Directed by Pontus ""Anjo"" Björlund, known as a one-sided narrative that manipulates the audience's emotions and lacks objective investigation. The director's agenda seems to be to greenwash a convicted criminal, discredit the witnesses, and ignore relevant facts from the judgment and the outcome in the Court of Appeal. The production quality involves terrible editing, inconsistent sound, and uninspired visuals.Additionally, the promotion trailer is under fire for exposing the victim's identity against legal decisions.",False
12,1,A technically awkward documentary,imdbfan-1330073429,n/a,16/08/2025,"While this ""documentary"" is clearly biased against a convicted felon, my main concern is the technical execution, which felt so underdeveloped that it became a constant distraction. Simply adding slow panoramic shots of graffiti-covered walls, generic drone footage and shaky camera footage with bad audio does not automatically elevate a film into something artistic.This reflects a broader issue among some self-proclaimed ""filmmakers"" who, encouraged by their YouTube audiences, believe they are producing masterful work when, in reality, their technical approach remains quite basic. The creator in question heavily relies, with every YouTube video, on templates, AI-generated filters on thumbnails, AI-generated music, and stock footage from various websites that he hasn't recorded himself -yet rarely faces any critique, only praise. His YouTube videos require almost no editing, as most of the work is done live through OBS, with minor additions like screenshots or recorded clips. Given that, it's not surprising that this documentary falls short in terms of technical quality.That being said, I do believe he has potential. However, to truly grow as a filmmaker, he needs to move away from shortcuts-whether due to time constraints or convenience-and invest in refining his editing and storytelling skills. This documentary was not his best work, but with more effort and attention to craft, he could achieve something much stronger in the future. But as long as he is smothered by his audience, making him believe that he is on ""TV-quality level"" with his documentaries, this will never happen. Fingers crossed!",False

1,9,Surprising...and the title isn't quite what you would expect.,planktonrules,n/a,16/08/2025,"With a title like ""Flooded Tombs of the Nile"", you would assume this National Geographic show is about the Egyptians...and that isn't quite right. While the archaeological site in this looks quite Egyptian, it's actually in Sudan and it that of the Kushites....specifically Nastasen, the Nubian king of Kush. What also makes this a really interesting site is that much of it's under water....making it necessary to use diving equipment to explore this grave. There are many other surprises in this show...such as the large number of pyramids in Sudan...something I never knew existed.Overall, a most fascinating and interesting show...far more interesting and unusual than I ever expected. Well worth seeing.",False
2,4,Flooded Tomb* of the Nile,ahgooseteen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you read the description, you've basically seen the documentary. I think roughly 35 minutes of this was talking about exploring the tomb, and about 10 minutes of it was then exploring the tomb/finding artifacts. 41 minutes in they tell you they'll be back next season to open the tomb.",True

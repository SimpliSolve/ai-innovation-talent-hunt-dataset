1,7,Mental Illness + Abuse + Racism = This,monikamarie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Those children were failed again and again and again, by everyone around them and the multiple agencies that should have investigated further. If the skin colors were reversed, the two adoptive 'mothers' would have been crucified upside down seconds after the first allegation was made. An absolute disgrace on every level. My heart breaks for those kids and everyone who loved them.",False
2,8,Detailed Backstory to an American Tragedy,pebsdad,n/a,16/08/2025,"This very detailed and informational documentary tells the horribly tragic case of the well known Hart family who plunged to their deaths on the California coast. It includes the history of the 6 adopted kids, the women who adopted them and the mistreatment these kids endured.Unfortunately, this story will be seized upon in a 'we told you so' manner and I write this review in counter to the other review by jfnaoau who portrays the family in a racist and homophobic way. These were great kids whose lives began and ended in unfortunate circumstances. These were 2 women who purposely misled the public and had terrible parenting skills. The race or family makeup makes no difference to what happened to this family. Fortunately the documentary does not try to paint this family unit in a negative light but focuses on the behavior of each individual. This is an American tragedy enhanced by the failures of the court and Child Protective Services.",False
3,7,:(,chyrece-69891,n/a,16/08/2025,"Horrible story, very sad and those kids could've been saved multiple times over. Blue hair guy thought he was doing something but actually did such a disservice to this these kids and their story. He made it unwatchable imo. His issue is with white people in general, not just the white people responsible for this tragedy, Which discredited an otherwise solid documentary. He was a poor choice.",False
4,6,Tragic story,slmarlowe-18314,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel that the African American man hijacked this story to try and make it about race. If you want to blame social services for not interfering, I think it has more to do with two lesbian parents than the fact that they are white. Everyone was fooled by the lesbian mothers having the picture perfect family. I don't know the laws in Texas, but why did the Aunt leave them with her daughter who let the biological mother come see them? There are no easy answers, and six beautiful children lost their lives in this social experiment.",False
5,10,A Superior Documentary . . . .,sundayatdusk-97859,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching the pathetic documentary ""A Thread of Deceit: The Hart Family Tragedy"" (2020), I wasn't sure I wanted to see another film on the Hart family. That documentary was outrageously focused on giving empathy to the two killer mothers. This film, on the other hand, is sane and shows how narcissism should never be mistaken for love. How driving off a cliff in order to kill six children is never acceptable or understandable behavior. How is was simply the easiest way in the mind of Jen Hart to evade CPS, and destroy all evidence of the abuse and starvation of her six adopted children. What would her friends and social media followers think if they knew the truth about how the children were actually treated?Kudos to Sheriff Tom Allman, psychologist Joni Johnston and journalist Zaron Burnett III for their sane and keen observations about the crime. Mr. Burnett gets a lot of flak in the film reviews at Amazon for his comments about how race played a role in the tragedy. Personally, I think that criticism is unfair, because there was nothing he said that wasn't true and insightful. So much more true and insightful than the comments made by friends defending the Harts in ""A Thread of Deceit: The Hart Family Tragedy"".Discrimination most certainly did play a role in the placement of three black children in a home with two white women in a far away state, when at least one totally responsible biological relative fought hard to adopt them. Jen Hart most certainly did play the role of the white savior saving the poor little black children from their birth family. Her social media posts were filled with such comments. Those three children were placed in their home, too, even though there were already complaints to CPS about abuse of the first three biracial children she and Sarah Hart adopted.Six children were murdered by women who thought they had the right to kill them. This wasn't even the story about a biological mother who had too many kids too fast, and was suffering from postpartum depression. This was a story about women who tell one lie after another until the day they kill themselves and their adopted children, to avoid the fallout after being exposed as liars. Dead kids, no witnesses to testify. Any bruises and broken bones would be seen as being caused by the crash. No one left to describe what really went on in the Hart household.",False
6,9,ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? NO NATIONAL CHILD ABUSE REGISTRY??? : O,midnitepantera,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the Worst and Most Heart breaking Travesties in the past few years!!I can't believe that these 2 white lesbians, Pretended to want kids, all the while, it was just for a SOCIAL MEDIA EGO BOOST!!! People, stop believing what you see on Stupid Lying Social Media. People just pretend to have better lives to make you jealous and feed their Monstrous EGO's. These poor children were nothing more than Props for Photo OP's. And all the Social Media junkies, just Eat this Up and look how that turned out for 6 innocent kids??? :OI have no objection to alternate family structures, as long as the kids are wanted, loved, well cared for and not being abused.I have BIG issue with this couple, As it seems they adopted 3 young black children, whom they seem to be taking good care of, at least if you believe the pictures and posts online. But turns out they had a history of abuse reported by teachers and school nurses. And since stupid America doesn't have a Child abuse Registry these (white) women were just slapped on the hand, the kids left with them, and they just moved to another state and started their FAKE LOOK at My Wonderful LOVELY HAPPY Kids I saved Facebook Media Site. And people fell for all the lies and couldn't get enough, while these kids were being, abused, starved, force to perform a Happy Dance in public or in front of cameras like trained circus poodles. Then thrown back into that house of HOrror. (Just cause a house is clean and neat doesn't mean it isn't a Nightmare) Where the main caregiver, Jen, just spend time Leading a Video Game group of over 50 players and thinking of new photo ops for the kids to Feed her Hero Savior complex and her massive EGO.I hope that these poor kids deaths are Not in Vain and that Full Cooperation from all states in the US finally get a Registry of Abuse and Neglect for Children in Place. And that a lot of the Stupid Judges out there that have handed kids back to horrific abuse and death are removed. They obviously aren't paying much attention to these kids cases and I wouldn't trust them to clean my cat box. Much less to decide on a child's safety.But to make things worse, they let these 2 monsters adopt a 2nd set of 3 young black siblings. Whom were taken from Their real Auntie, who had loved and taken excellent care of them, but for 1 mistake, she let their real mom see them. And the courts whisked them away. At worst all that should have happened was to document the incident and make it clear to the Auntie if this happened again she would potentially lose custody of the children.Social Media has just become A HUGE DANGER, and is so Full of FAKE Garbage, people pretending their lives are great, they have so much, they look so great when in reality the bulk of them Don't. Its an Illusion. And It's harming young people lives, self-esteem and especially small children. You all do know the Pedophiles follow all your kids pics online too Right??? It's not just adoring mom's and dads.I wait with baited breath to see if they can take down this Evil monster known as FACEBOOk (aka META (that abuses and exploits people with their meta data they so easily hand over, many not realizing they are making a deal with the Devil and sacrificing themselves and their kids)
Yeah, there's been a few good things to come from social media, finding a pet, a lost loved one, but overall the harm to children, teens, adults, animals, democracy is Much HIGHER.. Social Media has caused More Harm than Good and has made us a Bunch of Unfriendly, lying and Jealous FREAKS!! It's stealing all the Good things in our Humanity, with very little in return that's positive.All we can do is pray for these 6 children now. And work hard NOT to let this happen again and again and again. :(",False
7,5,Ugh,tcomway1986,n/a,16/08/2025,Ugh. It's such a sad story with a horrible outcome. However the documentary has such a obvious agenda it's sickening. The blue haired gentleman hates white people every time he comes on it's some kind of Condescending comment about white people specifically white women. This Messes with the whole documentary. The blue haired gentleman is gaggingly sickening.,False
8,8,What a tragic story,lhmosca,n/a,16/08/2025,"As expected, this documentary is HARD to watch. The lives these kids led is horrific. What also makes this hard to watch is the racism accusations that just aren't proven. To me, this is a woman (Jen) with severe mental health issues that were well hidden, a woman's partner (Sarah) who to me is a battered wife, controlled and doesn't know how to get out. I don't believe Sarah was a co-conspirator in the deaths, I think it was Jen. Irrelevant now. I think the ""system"" failed these kids, just like it fails kids every day all day long all over the country but racism? Nope. Not buying it. I think those kids would have been abused, neglected and ultimately killed no matter their skin color.",False
9,2,Exactly What You Would Expect,PhD_But_Not_A_Doctor,n/a,16/08/2025,"Two White lesbians became the guardians of six intractable black youths and proved what anyone without a corrupt mind already knew.The film is banal, with the obvious agenda of the director unintentionally providing the only true commentary on a society hopelessly professing/pretending to believe anything other than the truth.",False
10,10,Zaron Barnett,carolnall,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent job Zaron, I appreciate that you call it what is is. I will never understand how this tragic story played out but you have helped me tremendously. Thank you.",False

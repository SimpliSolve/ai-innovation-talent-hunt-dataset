1,6,Nice but Staged,rgaritacr,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm sorry but I am from Costa Rica so let me tell you something. When they were here in the lockdown there was no way they had a tattoo with a person not wearing a maskWe were very disciplined during the pandemia. Everything at that moment was closed. Everybody had to wear a mask. So even when the story is nice, it is not 100% real.I am aware they have to spice things up to tell the story. But please don't stage things this way.Again. It is a tv story. They probably recorded many of this recently and not during the pandemia. I think truth have to be told.Next time it's better to tell things as they happened.",True
2,6,More questions than answers,onelittlechilli,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn interesting story overall, though from the very beginning it felt a bit staged - seemingly more for media attention, virality, and popularity than genuine circumstance, especially on Matt's side. There's a possibility they were even in a relationship before this all began.Still, considering the number of vlogs (Matt was filming almost every second of the quarantine, starting from the very beginning of the date, even before they were stuck together), it's hard to ignore the strong influencer/vlogger ambitions on his part - it feels like that was a big motivation. Hard to believe that just three days before a global lockdown, they had absolutely no clue - not even a hint - that borders might shut down. And sure, hopping on an international flight in the middle of a rapidly escalating pandemic sounded like a brilliant idea. Especially considering Costa Rica had already announced, a day or two before their arrival, that it would be closing its borders for at least a month. But hey, who needs basic travel research or common sense when you've got spontaneity and a vlog camera, right?The segment involving the search for birth control pills and the conversation about her late period, googling cycle timelines, etc., felt unnecessary and overly intimate; not something that needed to be shared. Like a lot of other things too.",True
3,10,Pretty freakin adorable,limpfan106,n/a,16/08/2025,"An unplanned reality show. Better than a real reality show because it all happened so naturally. Very cute couple living through a fantasy vacation while experiencing the ups and downs of being forced to fast track getting to know each other, and falling in love in the process. The plot is like something out of a Disney movie except there is no villain.Nice to see something so uplifting once in a while. No crazy turns or cliff hangers, just two people falling in love unexpectedly and growing as people in the process due to a series of random and unpredictable pandemic related events. At least something good came out of covid.",False
4,2,Cringe,dan_90802,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe ""Documentary"" tag is disappointingly inaccurate. ""Reality?"" Sure. Which makes the whole thing cringeworthy. Why lie? A more apt title would be ""Wannabe 'Influencer' & Immature Woman Make a Movie.""On March 17, 2020 - weeks after the world was advised of a grave public health threat and a week after the WHO declared a global pandemic - a handsome white guy who wants to be an influencer buys cheap tickets to Costa Roca for himself and an immature 30-year old Asian girl he claims to want to take on a third date for five days. Cheap tickets because airlines had already figured out that travel would end soon. And then COVID unexpectedly happened?! Puh-leeze. If you read any newspaper, you knew already in December 2019 what was coming. After watching this docudrama, I conclude that it was professionally cast and deliberately (reen)acted .It is hard to know which parts, if any, were recorded during the putative vacation and which were made afterward. But it is crystal clear that much of the footage was created for the sole purpose of making a movie. So, it's insincere at best, but really it's just duplicitous factionalized ""reality.""Two stars because the wildlife was nice to see.",True
5,8,PANDEMIC LOCKDOWN MORPHS INTO THE LONGEST THIRD DATE!,Tony-Kiss-Castillo,n/a,16/08/2025,"A DOCUMENTARY??? Well.... Maybe... But certainly unlike ANY OTHER You have EVER seen!OK... If my INTRO has piqued Your curiousity... I urge You to set aside 75 Minutes of Your life (YEP! That's the TOTAL run time!) to take in one of the quirkiest ""Documentaries"" ever made!IMDb has also labeled it as REALITY TV... Which is somewhat closer to the REALITY of the production... But to be brutally honest, if ever there were a film that deserved its very own stand alone unique category... LONGEST THIRD DATE is most certainly that film!There is absolutely nothing in its 75 minutes that can be ""EXPLAINED""! Again... I am repeating this because there is just no getting around just how indispensable it is, in this Particular case, to scrutinize carefully the on-screen events... one by one... as they unfold, in this EXPLANATION-PROOF Movie!!!Well, having met the minimum character limit... seems as though my job is done! Maybe I could recommend that You read the TITLE of my Review again... as a reminder... And then I would tell You.... ""OK! You are GOOD to GO!""ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA!",False
6,3,Don't fall for it or watch is as a fiction.,io_is_here,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was a bit skeptical about that show when my wife started to watch it... but I gave it a go. It looked OK even though it was weird that he was filming everything.That weird taste continued to amplify when understanding that he was not filming for himself or to have some memories but for somebody else like influencers do.And when I saw NO numberplate on the Nissan car, which he REALLY stupidly drove into a pond, it immediately felt so totally staged and sponsorized that I stopped watching at once.That could have been a true story but that was obviously scripted and staged from the beginning till the end.",False
7,9,I also have given up before... then I met my wife.,robertsarmientoevangelista,n/a,16/08/2025,"When you are not ready to fall in love again.And you meet the person that changes that.That makes this Documentary so relatable.Even if they do not end up with each other, what they had is hard to beat. They did not sugar coat it.Relationship's that is based on Extreme situations like this do not last they say. However those that do last is inspiring.What makes this documentary appeals to me, is what happened to Khani, she tried hard not to fall in love again. But this time the guy turns out to be better.It is nice that there are some things that came out good from the pandemic.Extreme situations brings out the true you...That is what this documentary, reminds me of.",False
8,3,Annoying and More Annoying Make a Movie,IMDbGMB,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh my lord how is it possible two people can so quickly screw up a ""falling in love under strange circumstances"" premise?ANSWER: Cast the most self-absorbed talentless guy that films everything in his (dull) life like it was Citizen Kane and pair him with a shallow 30-something woman that speaks like a teenage Valley girl from the 80s. Gag me with a spoon this couple was repulsive.I can't give it only one star though, as the production quality was pretty good and the Costa Rican scenery was impressive. The random shots of wildlife were fun too.Still, I find this movie impossible to recommend short of *only* using it as a cautionary tale of what you might dredge up on Hinge. Scary.Don't do it. Just don't.",False
9,8,Sweet Story,asc85,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember originally reading about this story in the New York Post in 2020 during the pandemic, and thought it was pretty cool. Then I recently saw a follow-up in The Post, and was happy to see that they were still together. Then I was surprised to see that the reason for the update was that a documentary about their time in Costa Rica was going to be on Netflix!This had not been reviewed by many critics, and with so many things to stream, I usually like to see positive reviews before committing to something like this. But it was only 75 minutes long, and I did like the whole idea of it, so my wife and I decided to give it a shot.First of all, the footage is great, because Matt, the guy in this relationship, is a vlogger, so he recorded much of their Costa Rican trip. Who knew that it would be gold, and a documentary would come out of it?It's just a very sweet story. I'm not sure who made the editorial choices for this documentary, but this very easily could have become quite salacious, but that's not the direction it took. Because he is doing all the filming, Matt exerted a bit of control in how he would look in this documentary, because he is choosing what he wants to film and not to film. Khani didn't have that choice. Still, they showed her in a very positive light. Good for the filmmakers. I'm sure there is a good deal of footage that would be embarrassing to release out to the world. None of that is shown.I'm not saying it would be Pamela Anderson/Tommy Lee stuff, but I'm sure there is footage of them being drunk and/or naked that is no one else's business. Who's on their best behavior 24/7 anyway?When I am writing this review, they are still together. They need to do what is best for themselves, but it's hard not to root for them and their relationship lasting.",False
10,4,"Cute story, fascinating situation, annoying camera boyfriend!",jamesvass-62316,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having packed up and move to Europe for a year, my wife and I were intrigued to see this story unfold... Becoming stranded on holiday during a pandemic whilst on a third date is a recipe for disaster. But I just couldn't get over the guy in this story, we were all watching this show and just being embarrassed by this guy's tendency to film the most inappropriate things for the sake of his egotistical YouTube channel. The worst was him filming himself while driving a vehicle then putting his car on its side into the water... Then filming the locals helping them right the car up! The man bun, the topples filming of himself jogging, eating, drinking, getting haircuts... I struggled to the end, but my wife sort of liked it, so 4 it is...",False
11,8,Reality TV VLOG Netflix Documentary,MickyG333,n/a,16/08/2025,"7.5 stars.This film is a mouthful to be sure, a reality TV show of sorts, meets a vlogger on an escapade, meets Netflix Documentary. I was intrigued with this from the get go. Something about the authenticity of it all and the timing was really cool. Was this all real, it appears to be so. Did it all happen the way it's presented to us and the raw footage was utilized and edited into a documentary format? I'm convinced the answer is: yes. Did this girl and guy eventually fall in love organically (albeit they had no choice)? It looks like it. I don't know what else to say but it's an interesting little film with lots of footage taken from his vlog, if it's really authentic. If it's not authentic, then whatever, I was still entertained enough to round up to an 8.",False
12,1,An insult to intelligence,danielcereto,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am not sure why this fake documentary had happened. It's sold as real. And obviously it is not. It is easy to see that is mostly new footage. Embarrassing. And insult to intelligence.First and foremost, no mask or social distance anywhere, a car with no plates, a pharmacist with no mask, the car again without a camera inside recording...
Second, and probably the worst, is how d*mb and superficial the guy is. Looks like a ""daddy boy"" who lived pandemic in a bubble plenty of money coming from home. His major problems were having a haircut weekly or how to kill a spider. Great.Third, I don't get the point of the documentary. To me is about two rich uninspiring people who traveled to Costa Rica not taking any responsibility and then staying for two months on the most luxury Airbnb, hotels and host families I've never watched. And I've traveled to more than 30 countries including Costa Rica.Last, if your rental car in Costa Rica has damage you're in trouble with law enforcement, high amount of money to pay etc... Here it looks like everything is all right 'bro, we're here chilling around Pedro the Mechanic. Dumb.Anyway, If your brain still works, I suggest to avoid watching this fake painful uninspiring fake documentary about a time that was painful to most of people around the glove (My girlfriend chose this one) Lol.",True
13,10,Totally unexpected...,snfltnv,n/a,16/08/2025,"... attention since the first minutes... I'm definitely not a fan of influencers, reality shows, neither romantic movies or sth... it's even hard to find something what caught my attention on Netflix lately but my boyfriend always plays something which I never would...and this really caught my attention...the documentary part and all the Costa Rica views and everything was amazing, also how empty it was, so strictly following the anticorona rules...crazy but so real... I'm really writing this review crying...it was so sweet and real...i hope..you never know these days...I wish you all the best.",False
14,1,Embarrassing. Not sure what netflix is thinking,sophiefterhorst,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a cute story to tell your friends at best. To make a whole documentary about it is very overdone. I would have given it a 5 if at least the people in it had likeable personalities, but that's a disappointment too. The guy grabs his camera at every moment she feels vulnerable, uncomfortable or upset, and he knows it. In fact, that is what he wants because in his mind he is creating interesting content. Every time you see her getting uncomfortable and laughing her discomfort away, he pushes her more. It's incredibly cringey to watch.There really is nothing about this documentary that makes it remotely interesting.",False
15,10,I really loved this story!,18Buddha,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was expecting ratings to be in the 8-10s, im shocked its at 6.4! Im not a fan of love films but here and there I discover some very good ones that really are touching & heartwarming to see.This is a true story short film on a man & a woman who both are single, not looking for anything serious and meet by chance on I think Tinder? They eventually go on a 3rd day vacationing Costa Rica right when the pandemic hit and their trapped in Costa Rica.What you will witness in the 1 hour 15 minutes of this film is 2 people who are under the strains of being stuck together 24/7 for along time together awaiting for flights to open again back to New York all the while trying too keep the happy vibes alive n worry for their loved ones back home. Slowly you will witness the love story bloom between 2 ppl who evolve together with each day that passes.Their were so many funny moments & I really thought wow these 2 are such a good fit for each other in personality & their personal qualities. Now as they try to brave the many weeks together u will discover eventually is being trapped so long together gonna make them long to be free from each other? Or will this end in a happy ending? Im not at the ending yet so I duno what happens but I seen enough of this film that I felt I can rate it and not regret it when I finish the last 30 minutes of this film.Literally this story is 1 of a kind & too miss it watching would be a shame because through their eyes we get to see their time together and how its spent, the effort it took to keep it together as well as the moments u see them looking like their about to break.So I hope you enjoy this documented vlog experiencing & sharing in their adventures as I have & its such a well documented film. They both documented every moment of their adventures, high points, low points, frustrated moments and exploring The beautiful country of Costa Rica to make this film So impressive!Its also not some cheap camcorder too lol, the quality of videos shot were amazing.",False
16,1,"Potential to be Cute, but Disgusting",florw,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI remember hearing about this story back in 2020, so I went into this thinking, ""oh cute, they made a documentary on this story!""I agree with other reviewers that Matt is definitely awkward and creepy in the beginning filming EVERYTHING. As a female, I would be creeped out (but I also wouldn't travel to Costa Rica for a week on a 3rd date). He perhaps was being inappropriate in the beginning.But let's do a run down here:She travels to Costa Rica without telling her work. Clearly this is an issue and clearly she's out and about doing activities during the day. Her poor coworkers who are picking up the slack!She doesn't tell her parents, fine. Her friends know. But then when she does finally tell them she lies about who she's with, as a 29 year old adult. THEN when she finally realizes she has to tell her dad so he doesn't find out in the news, she lies about the lie she's telling him....and then is surprised he handled it so well and is wondering why she needs to be a compulsive liar...when the lie she told him is because the truth would piss him off, so of course he's taking it better than he would the truth!""Oh crap, I'm late. I might be pregnant. Oh well, instead of taking a pregnancy test I'll just ride it out and continue drinking all day every day"" Seems odd that any of that would even need to come into play. The ""I need more sketchy birth control"" aspect is interesting, but ""my period didn't come...oh it came"" was just so glossed over and an irrelevant storyline.10/10 if Khani wasn't such a gross daughter and employee.",True
17,10,A fortunate misfortune.,jackiee1970,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can you imagine taking a spontaneous trip for a third date and getting stuck with that person in a foreign country for months. That's what happened to Matt and Khani. Seeing how they navigated through the situation was inspiring. Seeing their guards go up and down, their insecurities and vulnerabilities... but ultimately their trust in the free fall, truly was amazing to watch. I went into this not expecting much, but throughly enjoyed the ride.I found myself actually longing for such spontaneity in my own life. Maybe I will just fly somewhere unexpected and trust in myself e pick to just see what happens.Brilliant Documentary.",False
18,2,Boring.... find something else to do for an hour.,kgirlsmomma,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere really is nothing about this documentary that makes it remotely interesting. Boring self-obsessed couple looking for attention. I am sorry I wasted anything past 30 minutes trying to give it a chance to redeem itself. Because of the self-absorbed nature of the people involved it is very easy to see where this was going. Any serious challenges were not portrayed. 'Fluff' piece, in all honesty. They portray 'problems' that they created themselves. Jetting off during a pandemic, 4-wheeling when they didn't know where they were and damaging their vehicle. Showing zero sense of intelligence or accountability for their self-created drama.",True
19,8,Nice,kikoteixeira,n/a,16/08/2025,"Boy and girl with similar IQ levels. She realizes the guy in front of her is different than past boyfriends. She thinks he's cool, when, in reality, he is vlogging. They realize they don't have to actually communicate feelings in order to get a superficial relationship to work. They work out long enough to get a Netflix special. Voila!Seriously though, maybe this reality movie has a deeper meaning: if you want to make a relationship work out, do a few things. 1. Have low expectations about what you want in your partner. 2. Lock yourselves inside. 3. Drink a lot. 4. Have similarly primitive communication skills.",False
20,2,"Girl run run run, he's a narcissist!",jwtnpvzjm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Girl meets narcissist, goes to Costa Rica on THIRD DATE, doesn't get murdered lol but Covid proximity creates Stockholm syndrome love???Crazy narcissist boyfriend FILMS EVERYTHING it's such an uncomfortable watch, it's awkward, cringe, and doesn't feel that without being forced into proximity through covid that any relationship would have other wise come from their initial dates.Girl, watch yourself in this - he films you when you're looking sooooooo deeply uncomfortable, he doesn't stop when you ask him to, he talks about your private sex life in a boastful conquest way.... Please don't stay in that toxic relationship.Really shocked Netflix didn't recognise this as a coercive and controlling relationship and borders/ looks at times like abuse (however sugar coated).",False
21,8,Falling in Love? Despite the Circumstances!,lornak-18008,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember reading about this couple during the pandemic early days. They had just started dating with two dates under their belt and only one kiss. When the guy who is always up for an adventure invites the girl on a 4 day trip to Costa Rica she hesitates but decides to go. What can happen? He does not give off murder vibes or anything. So they go in an almost empty airplane. Others are pandemic worried but they aren't. Within a couple of days they realize that things are getting bad in New York City where they are from. Then their flight gets cancelled. We watch them navigate being alone together for a long time with someone they barely know. It's a struggle at first. Neither is looking for love or a relationship. I found it to be a simple story that ended up fascinating, to me at least. The guy filmed everything so all the film footage is real. It was good.",False
22,1,Don't waste your time,spin_sugar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Believe all the other low rating reviews. They are true.I'm not even going to waste my time explaining the 1 star and I will write that if you choose to kill a spider and praise yourself on camera and buy a french bulldog instead of at least adopting one from Costa Rica (plenty of strays in need there) or just adopt, you represent everything that's wrong with the world today.If you want to influence people, start with the basics. Influence people on how to care for the world around us, for the animals. Taking a video of yourself in nature while killing insects, and buying a dog, even more a flat faced one instead of adopting, it's anything but that.",False
23,8,What a way to start a relationship,paulcroft,n/a,16/08/2025,"Boy meets girl on steroids! Imagine going to a foreign country on your third date with a person you barely knew. And when you get there you have to share the bed! That was a wake up right at the beginning. And then the date never ends because of the covid pandemic and you can't get home, so the date never ends!To top it off, the guy is an influencer so he films everything, and that's the good parts and the bad parts! So when the date finally ends and they're able to come home, he has a really good video record to present as a documentary. And it's actually pretty good! It doesn't seem staged and doesn't seem like he set out to make a doc, it just happened. So we spend 60+ days with the two of them as they visit various places in Costa Rica during the lock down.I was hooked from the trailer and really enjoyed this, but it does get a little cringe worthy as certain things happen. I found it intérêt that she hadn't told her dad who she was with until she absolutely had to reveal it.This isn't something that I'd watch again, but it was pretty good and gave me a really good look at a beautiful place I'd love to see.",False
24,8,Two Likeable People,bt698nhj,n/a,16/08/2025,"I generally don't like people.These are two very likeable people. They are both funny and spontaneous and creative and entertaining. And the story is very heartwarming. And the documentary is done very well. What's not to like? Watch it.ABOUT MY REVIEWS:I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable.",False
25,8,Not for those with cold dead hearts,karenwalsh-28241,n/a,16/08/2025,"This really didn't seem like it would be my sort of thing at all so I'm late to watching it and I went in with zero expectation given the 6.4 rating.It was one of those days though. Time to fill and not wanting anything that would involve either engaging my brain or worrying about how crappy the world is right now.I have to say, this was perfect. A really sweet distraction from all the awful things around us. Were parts of it reenacted? Possibly. Does it detract from the story? No! Shame on you cold dead-hearted cynics marking it down. Everyone's an influencer now, but I felt positively influenced after watching this and don't we all need a bit of that. Wishing Matt & Khani all the happiness in the world.",False

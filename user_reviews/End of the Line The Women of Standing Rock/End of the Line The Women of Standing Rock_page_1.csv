1,10,SO MOVING / MUST SEE!!,crystelle-35702,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a must-see documentary that literally affects every single human and sentient being on Earth. Deeply moving and one of the most important films you'll see and show your children. The film contains first-hand, insider footage of the 10 month protest that occurred in 2016 and up until the recent developments of 2020. If you did not know, the pipe was approved and installed (thanks, Trump) and has indeed already leaked (as predicted). I hope there will be a sequel to this awesome film, and it will show the deserved and rightful Victory of peaceful return of the sacred land to the Water Protectors. Bless everyone who supports this film! BRAVO!!!!",False
2,10,Wow - Must Watch!,pais_hn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I come from Latin America, where we have many similar problems with land rights. I did not think this type of oppression exists in the U. S. A. To see all of the violence committed against these women made me sick. But also I was so inspired by how they kept their heads held up high despite all of the obstacles that they have faced for so many years. This is not an easy film to watch. It should not be. We should all be horrified by what happened at Standing Rock. Thank you to the filmmakers who so beautifully captured this very sad mark on America. It takes bravery to tell such a story. I wish this film would be seen by all of humanity.",False
3,10,Water is life/Mni Wiconi,xichel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Water is life. We all need and depend on water. A film like this that highlights not only the Water Protectors, but the powerful womxn who lead the way, needs to be shown on every platform possible!
Thank you to the filmmakers who kept this movement alive by capturing it on film, so that we can continue to understand the importance of standing for what is truth and justice.
I hope that this film is also viewed in schools and becomes part of curriculum. Standing Rock is a historical moment and should be highlighted and talked about for generations upon generations. Great blessings to all who are involved in this film. Thank you for protecting our sacred Mother Earth.",False

1,9,Worthy Watch for Beastie Fans,dan-ragan-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are so many negative reviews, I need to balance it out. Some of the reviews miss the big picture. Yes, it is a live narration in front of an audience. Is it unusual? Yes, it is and may have generated some people to feel a certain way about it vs a traditional documentary. But it was put out by artists and is the way the artists wanted to present their story, this is the whole purpose of art in the end; creativity and evoking emotion. Also, because it is live does not mean it was supposed to be ""unscripted"", nor do the Beastie Boys pretend that it is, they mention the teleprompters several times and even pan to them at one point. I enjoyed the live ""living history"" feel of the documentary. I didn't feel like it was contrived or egocentric.As far as the content, it is the history of the band. They didn't delve into the personal lives of the band members but told the story of their friendship and the band's history. Diamond and Horovitz don't avoid, or hide their past, they address it. It's part of the story, they grew as musicians, they grew as humans. There is one recurring theme, Adam Yauch was the moral compass of the group, the creative force, and the strength that held them all together.",False
2,9,Yale Yauch...,DukeEman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mike and Adam get on stage and tell it like it is, with the help of the creative genius, Spike Jonze. Never a dull moment as they go back to the roots and reveal all in a Bestie Boys sort of way. Filled with humour, intelligence, emotions, but most of all, MUSIC! Most importantly is the relationship all three had. It was a very tight bond and this stage show really highlights that with paying tribute and respects to the legendary Yauch...",False
3,7,Grown up nostalgia trip.,nigelmacdonald-97173,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although this made me feel really old, I liked that the remaining members acted their age and didn't embarrass themselves by pretending to be 22 again. This was a genuine attempt to be honest and tell an amazing story with humour and emotion. The music will always sound fresh and original. It also seems to serve as a tribute to Adam Yauch and its obvious how much he was pivotal to the bands creation.",False
4,10,Finally... Thank you for the moment,nabobowman,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a quintessentially Beastie Boys moment. Doing a documentary their own way just like they did it with music. Always creating something new. This is story telling, an opportunity to walk back in time with these artists as they guide us through a journey from their perspective. An ode to MCA. An adventure that's worth the ride. I laughed out loud. I cried out loud. I got up and danced. I fell in love again. Thank you.",False
5,10,A must see for fans and sorta-fans,vaudeville1980,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm glad I caught this documentary/live show on Apple TV. My eyes have definitely been opened and I see the Beastie Boys in a whole new light.Literally had tears in my eyes from the laughs and the stories about Yauch. What a class act he was - all of them actually. Stellar job Spike Jonze!,False
6,7,Born in 1983,joelfahey,n/a,16/08/2025,"Born in 1983. Didn't listen much until Intergalactic, my 8th grade year. My friends in grade school & into high school listened to Death Row, No Limit & Cash Money. We were young city white kids into NFL Starter jackets. Internet sucked, simple times. My older brother had album Check your Head, I was hooked. Awesome to see where this amazing music originated. This is definitely not your standard documentary about a music group. I really like the format, made me feel like I was lucky enough to be able to attend this event. Sure people might expect a biopic or intense narrated film, but this felt personal. Yes, they are prompted, but nobody could get through that many years w/o skipping pivotal things otherwise. Must watch.",False
7,10,A must see...'nuff said,wowmaniac,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a somewhat old sod i grew up with Beastie Boys and this inside story told by sadly the only two of the boys still with us made me laugh and brought a tear to my eye...more that once i might add.
Its rare to see a friendship like those 3 guys had and the 2 still with us still have....very touching and quite emotional to watch.
So if you have even the slightest interest in Beastie Boys you owe it to yourself to watch this :-)",False
8,6,Format does a disservice to a story with so much more,BigJimNoFool,n/a,16/08/2025,The unfortunate thing about this approach taken here with the 2 remaining B Boys on stage is that it feels so scripted and really clinical which is everything i thought the Beasties were not. What i wanted from their story on film is a bit more anarchy and the chaos of 80s and 90s NY to come out not two middle aged legends on stools talkin bout the good ole days.Disappointed fan.,False
9,10,An absolute must see,betofranca,n/a,16/08/2025,"As my colleague said earlier, this is for Beastie Boys fans and for not so much fans, this is their story, with insights from the genius people that make Beastie Boys one of the greatest bands ever!",False
10,6,Triple Trouble,southdavid,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another documentary on the Apple Plus network is ""Beastie Boys Story"" a recording of a stage show in which the two remaining members of the band tell their story. Though I'm not a big Beastie Boys fan (I know the hits and that's about it), the show was touching and funny - if a little contrived at times.Mike Diamond, Adam Yauch and Adam Horovitz, three friends form a band in New York in the early 1980's. Initially Punk inspired - the boys are then heavily influenced by the growing Rap scene - and have immediate success with their first album ""Licenced to Ill"". By learning instruments and how to sample and mix, the band enjoy thirty years of success and friendship which is cut short in 2012 when Adam Yauch passes away. This stage presentation has 'Mike D' and 'Ad-Rock' tell their story, mixed with footage displayed on a cinema screen behind them and was put together with long-time collaborator Spike Jonze.The documentary is a rather straightforward recording of that stage show that ran for a few nights. A few of the more esoteric moments, heckles from the crowd by Ben Stiller, Steve Buscemi and David Cross, as well as a performed scene with Michael K Williams, are left for moments within the credits. The bulk of the show is live narration by Diamond and Horovitz interspersed with historical footage. Mostly this works OK and is quite honest and open, particularly about how bad they were to former friends and bandmates after they blew up and how they feel about losing their brother so early. Occasionally it's less successful though, there are moments of spontaneous ""banter"" and reactions to a mistake that Jonze makes that feel rehearsed and don't look natural at all.I'd say I enjoyed it overall but can't help but feel like a more traditional documentary, with the guys as edited talking heads would have made a better one.",False
11,10,"Heartwarming, moving & unpretentious",iheartson-55966,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beastie Boys was a MAJOR part of my childhood and early teenage years, this documentary brought back many great memories. So many great photos and great clips, charmingly narrated and super entertaining. I guess its fair to say that Adam Yauch was somewhat of a pioneer for the DIY / creative director / designer thing in hiphop found in current acts like A$AP Ferg etc. Admirable how they stayed at it and stayed friends through all the years while making great music and challenging themselves and exploring their sound all along. 10/10",False
12,7,A painted line,vyrkgrl,n/a,16/08/2025,"What was worth it:Fascinating little insights about who they knew, their journey and the framework of their history. A couple of little seemingly touching moments.What wasn't worth it:For a group who throw themselves out there as edgy and real, this did not come across as real.Their constant fight for their right to be individuals never seems to be realised because they are too busy performing. That's what this documentary felt like, a performance, a painted line when I was interested in the concrete underneath.I feel an absence of witnessing any of their morality or character. Maybe they don't even know it.This may just be a too busy being extroverted and partying to reveal any real sense of self, maybe it is missing but I experienced a few ""I'm not sure I like these guys moments.""Or they just didn't want to share that to the cameras.Either way it was an entertaining look at the Beastie Boys. Welcome to the entertainment business!",False
13,5,I was a huge Beastie Boys fan,cmoreland72,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was a huge Beastie Boys fan back in the day!! The License To Ill tour was the first concert I ever went to! I knew every lyric on the album by heart!! I counted down the days for Pauls Boutique to drop and it was excellent!!
This documentary is a head scratcher! I've been waiting to see it since it came out (to relive some of my youth).....finally got an Apple TV subscription to watch it. Great to see behind the scene stuff but commentary seemed forced.
Disappointing. Sorry not sorry.",False
14,10,"Influential, engaging and a must-see.",SnobReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Beastie Boys Story"" is an honest, engaging and profound documentary about music's greatest rap/rock group. A thoroughly original music doc unlike anything you've ever experienced.
.
In this live documentary, Beastie Boys Mike Diamond and Adam Horovitz tell you an intimate, personal story of their band, and their years of friendship together live on stage.
.
Throughout the two-hour experience, viewers get to see the remaining Beastie Boys on-stage telling their story through rare photos and footage. It's an engaging, emotional and beautiful celebration of a definitive career. Director Spike Jonze has created a new way of telling stories with documentaries and I loved it and I am for it. You get to rediscover why this group was so successful and influential to this day. A stand-out piece of filmmaking.

15,9,Worth the watch,bri-99065,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was only a casual fan of the Boys when I was a kid, but loved watching the bands journey & how they evolved. What they went through & how they changed to stay successful was awesome. The raw emotion at the end makes the movie!!",False
16,n/a,Smug Vanity Piece,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLike some other reviewers here, I was disappointed in the presentation format--a standup comedy (?) slideshow, in front of a large crowd of adoring fans. This seemed to push home the point that these two men sorely crave adulation. There were so many cuts to the audience laughing and clapping... it was too traditional and a bit desperate.What's sad is the lost potential.At least at the end of the show, they give a nice tribute to Yauch. But why did Jonze wait 8 years to do this film?Aside from the format, the constant smirking, and self-congratulatory vibe from the two dudes (one in particular) got real tired, real quick.Now, drop the mic (not).",True
17,6,Retrospect doesn't matter,adamoda14,n/a,16/08/2025,"The presentation was in a word, corny. Despite the sappy commentary and wishful revisionism through a politically correct lens, this flick is worth checking out. It was great to see some footage for the first time, learning about the very early years and reliving the whole scene around '92. If you're a fan of their music and early hip-hop, you will want to watch this.",False
18,9,Only for fans,paul-scollon,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are not a massive Beastie Boys fan, this will likely bore you. However, for real fans, there are nuggets of pure gold within. Very entertaining. However, the main thing you come away with is how much the remaining members miss their friend Adam ""MCA"" Yauch.",False
19,7,Heartfelt & Humourous,nitro72,n/a,16/08/2025,"Heartfelt & humourous account - told in a ""live"" theatre setting - is both a warm & loving tribute to its one fallen member, as well as a revelatory history of a groundbreaking band, yet still feels somewhat incomplete.#nitrosMovieChallenge.",False
20,9,Their Glory Days on Stage and Screen.,lovejam,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've always enjoyed the music of the Beastie Boys, since their ""License to Ill"" album. I felt like I'd grown up with them too. Seemed like their music was ripening until the death of their third member, Adam Yauch, aka McA. Watching and listening to their live show was very entertaining, seeing these grown men before me, matured yet their boyishness still present. Watching this documentary of their live show made me miss Adam Yauch and the more albums that could've happened. I'm glad they didn't make any more after his death too. I can't imagine how they'd sound without him or with anyone else? I also have to say, ""Paul's Boutique"" was underrated while ""Hello Nasty"" was overrated. Yeah, I said it. Regardless, loved their music and loved the film.",False
21,7,Beastie Boys Do a Ted-Talk and Leave You Smiling,KinoBuff2021,n/a,16/08/2025,"'Beastie Boys Story' (2020) is not just a film for fans but also a documentation of the measurement of the close friendship, growth, and maturity that the Beastie Boys had done over their respective lives.It's a live documentary which makes it seem like a Ted-Talk or a theatre piece with properly rehearsed narration and carefully placed music and video throughout the film. This gives the film such a different and more personal feel to the film as you hear from Mike D and Ad-Rock in what feels like a personal conversation.This live style is more touching but I feel that its almost too personal at times although that's because I was under the impression it would be a regular music documentary based off both the book and show. Again I was smiling the whole film, but I feel like there was so much more to tell if it wasn't done live.It's worth watching for anyone because the friendship of Mike D and Ad-Rock and their in-depth narration make everything touching regardless of your knowledge of the band. Its good just not great.",False
22,10,Loved every second!,elizabooth-575-828612,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of my favorite bands of all time, telling their story live to an audience was perfect. I love how Mike D & Adrock were just a bit awkward but also really heartfelt. If you didn't love BB before this, you will after watching! Highly recommend!",False
23,7,nostalgic for the late 80's? you get the bad with the good,willfair-93667,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary's format is novel, blending multimedia elements, archival footage, and live narration, creating a dynamic narrative that reflects the Beastie Boys' experimental ethos. Musical segments are a standout feature, celebrating the group's rich catalog while evoking nostalgia for fans and curiosity in newcomers.However, the film's introspective tone occasionally feels uneven. While Horovitz and Diamond openly address their early lyrics and behavior, particularly regarding misogyny, their preemptive apologies can come across as performative rather than deeply reflective. Their acknowledgment of youthful ""idiotic white boy entitled-ness"" is commendable, but the framing seems calculated to deflect criticism before it fully arises. This approach risks undermining the sincerity of their apologies, leaving viewers to wonder whether the effort is more about damage control than genuine accountability.Despite this, Beastie Boys Story is a compelling watch, offering humor, heartfelt moments, and a unique window into the world of a band that consistently pushed creative boundaries. For fans, it's a must-see celebration of their legacy, though it may leave some viewers questioning the balance between redemption and reputation management.",False
24,4,Read their book instead,taas,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was very curious about this from the start : a *Spike Jonze* *documentary* about the *Beastie Boys*, what could go wrong ? Well let's get straight to the point : the format chosen, a filmed live stage show, just does not work for them. After one hour and half of it I dropped the TV remote unable to cope anymore with this Beastie Boys x Annual Corporate Meeting show x TED crossover.So my first advice would be to skip this so called documentary and go for the excellent book they released last year. And my second one would be for those who enjoyed the film but do not know the book : read it !",False
25,10,A must watch,payupyou,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed every minute of this film. I'm just a little older than these guys and love all of their music. Although I'm a blues/jazz fan and wasn't much into mainstream or top 40 music growing up, I always liked what the Beastie Boys did. Fact - I have all of their music converted to reel to reel because I prefer the warmer unmolested sound.
The film kind of left me with a tear in my eyes - Mike and Adam did a great job conveying the relationship they all had and you clearly can feel their pain at the loss of Yauch - as many of us fans have but not in the way these two did.
The film is a great watch and one all fans of music need to have in their collection.",False

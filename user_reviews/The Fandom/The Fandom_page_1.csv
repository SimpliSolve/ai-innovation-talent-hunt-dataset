1,1,Not Worth Your Time,Metal_Wolf,n/a,15/08/2025,"Truth be told, this is a very disappointing look at the furry fandom and probably one of the worst documentaries out there. While the history was fascinating and some of the old footage from conventions was cool to look at, the rest of the documentary was either very boring, felt forced in, or was poorly researched. This wasn't helped by the fact that the people they interviewed were not that engaging and the addition of slow-motion shots, along with the lack of any sort of narration, made this a chore to watch at times. Aside from that, again, a few of the subjects this documentary brought up felt unneeded or not researched very well. If this was better made and had a bigger budget, along with doing better or more research into the various topics it tackles, then perhaps this would've been a decent documentary but, as it stands now, this is honestly not worth watching.",False
2,10,Very informative!,valerieschmidt,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was really well done, considering the fact that this was made by a small group of people! It gave lots of information on the fandom, that I never knew before! This answers so many questions, and it shows how people got the wrong idea in the first place. It clears up a lot of misconceptions about the fandom.",True
3,1,Perhaps a difficult watch for those not in the Furry community,jake_fantom,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI suspect that the 10-star reviews you will find here are for the most part written by people sitting around in their favorite furry costumes. For the rest of us, I am not sure there is much insight, emotion, or entertainment to be gained from watching this documentary. It consists largely of interviews with middle-aged and senior furries who talk endlessly about how life-changing and transformative their discovery of furry culture has been. This is juxtaposed with similarly endless low-res shaky home video footage of glorious furry conventions of years gone by, choppily edited -- basically, what seems like hours of people in animal costumes wandering through badly-lit convention centers, to what end I am not certain. So if you are a furry yourself, you're likely to find this just absolutely fascinating. If you're anyone else, maybe not so much. I tried my damnedest to watch this through over six or eight successive nights, but only got about half-way through. Ten minutes of The Fandom at a time was all I could handle. As always, your mileage may vary.",True
4,10,A Perfect Documentary Covering the Furry Fandom,jordanjdail,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Fandom perfectly shows us the the history behind the Furry Fandom! Tons of lost media from older conventions pack this feature alongside Top notch Editing and Cinematography too. Honestly words escape me when describing how happy deep down I feel as I rewatch the Fandom. The Furry Fandom has so much good in it. Finally other people can get a great feature film to see what the Furry Fandom truly is all about.If there was anything you could choose to relax and watch with with some friends and family, I sincerely recommend The Fandom!",False
5,1,I want 88 minutes of my life back,FernTheFox,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerDespite the most positive reviews, this film is an absolute dumpster fire. First of all the film feels like the equivalent of being drilled in the back of the head for 88 minutes which could be used elsewhere. Second of all, the cinematography feels devoid of anything worth remembering (There is 1 shot that was, but it kinda looked like something out of a Michel Bay movie). Third, at times it treats you like a moronic viewer by explaining what a fan base is (like we're a bunch of idiots who don't know what that is.) And the final reason why this is a dumpster fire is that this movie tries, but utterly fails at planting a seed of doubt in you, literally all that is used to try and plant it is murrsuits and nazis. All in all, it tries but utterly fails at what it needs to be... a good documentary worth watching and worth caring for the people in it. All in all definitely not worth your 88 minutes. 1/100",True
6,1,This did not feature Autism!,eeveeeevee,n/a,15/08/2025,"How dare this show not feature Autism! You know how well I feel now! That's it, this abomination of mammalian studies from the 21st century proved to me that they probed abuse to the classics and ruined are the old and there is no gold left in the united states, canadas, or mexico, which is really bad!!! Curse this abomination of a show, for Greeny Phatom manage to become a better hit? Of course, it has done. Greeny Phatom and GoAnimate is awesome compared to this stuff which tells you a lot about this stuff as a whole in the concept of zoology and zoophilas. These guys are zoophilas and they know it, but they won't accept that fact as true. Why? Maybe it is shame of them, or not? Who knows?????? Point being: this movie is the reason abortion has to be legal amirite? You don't want your kid to get a depression or bipolar by being a furry religious right? Make your kids happy at home by preparing them human foods and snacks and not dog food cat food or cat-hybrid (point the thumbnail) foods. CATS ARE NOT JURRASIC PARK OR JURASSIC WORLD! CATS ARE ALIVES UNTIL 22ND CENTURY NOW! Cats have to be eaten by people otherwise we would be in trouble with no plants as the vegans animals being meanies to the world of 123 greeny phatom! You know, when I first saw things movie, I vomited. Now I feel like I caught a fever (a furry fever). So yeah, this movie is a dumpster fire and I never want to see it again!Animal Rights! Autism Rights! Zoologist Rights! Animals are citizens and have the right to vote! Furries are a corrupt idelogy for the young and Universal is the fault of that. Buzz off Universal and buzz off fake indie artists you hear me? GOOD DAY, or good night.",False
7,10,The history begins,elietexel,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is an extraordinary look at where everything begins. The individuals that were interviewed where the ones that made this fandom as great as it is! It's an in depth look at the start of it all, a few of the struggles that almost toppled this fandom over and the love of furry art that keeps us together. The video quality is really good, the use of old footage was used in ways that drag you into the movie. It is an exhilarating movie that, in my opinion, will go down in our history as a masterpiece that will be watched for generations to come.",False
8,10,A fine furry film,btlabarre,n/a,15/08/2025,"A very well put together documentary showcasing the history of the furry fandom. Contains information from many different leaders of furry conventions, and gives an honest overview of how cons got where they are today. Highly recommend to any furry curious about such things.",False
9,10,Refreshing Take On The Internet's Most Misunderstood Fandom,alxhx,n/a,15/08/2025,The Fandom is well researched and leaves out the drama and subjectivity in favor of an honest objective examination of one of the internet's most Misunderstood subcultures. The documentary has good flow hits the emotions and punchlines at exactly the right points. I highly encourage people who even dislike furries to give it a shot. But this is also a great resource for any college fandoms course or for those who just want to find out what this whole furry thing is about.,False
10,10,A refreshing look at a misunderstood community,admiralbeanbagvg,n/a,15/08/2025,"I went into this with low expectations, given the subject matter. fandom related movies and documentaries seem to follow that really low budget and home made feel, but this works in a very wholesome way. If you're ever curious about the furry fandom, definitely start here. The history it covered was eye opening, and gave me an appreciation for this niche group. I highly recommend this.",False
11,9,The New 'Go-to' 'This is what Furry is' Video,taitorion-75635,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Fandom is the most comprehensive, entertaining and honest look into the furry fandom I have ever seen. As a long time part of the furry fandom myself I was shocked that even I learned so much about our history watching this doc. From all the interviews with some of the first furries to the STAGGERING amount of old footage they were able to find and use from some of the first furry cons Ash manages to beautifully piece together the story of how the fandom came to be what it is today in a way that is easily digestible, inspiring and entertaining to watch.
People often stray away from certain topics when making videos like this such as the topic of sex in the fandom, I was very pleased to see Ash does not shy away from the topic but rather shows the differing opinions on it in an unbiased way.
Overall I would recommend this doc to anyone who was interested in the furry fandom.
Its great for total newcomers who want a grasp on what furry is
Its great for long time furries who want to learn more about their history
Its great for total outsiders who are just curious about this sub-cultureFantastic job to everyone on this small team",False
12,10,Captivating insiders view of the fandom,skyfoxlogin,n/a,15/08/2025,This documentary is AMAZING and a must watch. It has a clean professional look and feel. I don't know how a team this small pulled this off in the time they did. AMAZING,False
13,9,Good and comprehensive look at the history of an oft-maligned subculture,dhamel0626,n/a,15/08/2025,"From its origins as a nerdy subculture that met at sci-fi cons to its current huge fandom with multiple enormous cons around the world, enormous charity outreach, and family-like community, the furry fandom is lovingly archived in this informative doc. Good production values, and interviews with some of the important names in early furry, along with some very interesting current makers and showrunners keeps things moving along nicely. If you're already in the furry fandom, you may already be aware of much of this, but if you're an outsider looking in, it gives a clear window into what makes the community tick. Also, for people inside the fandom that are afraid or uncertain how to explain it to people around you, this would serve as a comfortable and illuminating first step into what makes the fandom an unique and welcoming space. There's some talk about the early struggles with the media and the negative coverage the fandom received, as well as some talk about the (gasp!) sex that might be happening! As a piece of media by furries looking inward, it feels like a new lens on a topic that has been done to varying levels of success from the outside. There are maybe some points missing from the overall picture, but with a topic this big, it's impossible to cover everything in a single feature length doc.",False
14,10,Time capsule worthy,patchofurr,n/a,15/08/2025,"Who doesn't love cartoon animals, at least from familiarity if not vocally?Some people go beyond the familiar, and want more than what the mainstream serves up. These extra-devoted fans have carved out a space with its own quirks and history.Furry fandom has been overlooked as more than a curiosity for a long time, even with warmer outside media looks in recent years.I don't care very much about ""Furry 101"" introductions. The Fandom could be one, and feels light to watch (thanks to care in using modest resources for a nicely edited professional feel), but it isn't insubstantial. It adds quite a bit of depth.The best aspect of the doc is the loving care put into unearthing archival footage and digitizing old VHS tapes, then setting it against contemporary interviews of the same subjects today.As time goes on, much of that past would be forgotten without an effort like this. Everyone is lucky that it exists.There are some criticisms that this has PR appeal and skirts contentious subjects. A documentary that addresses every aspect of decades of activity is a magical unicorn. I would advise ignoring or taking those criticisms as unavoidable. There's lots of room to welcome different takes, make your own media, or do research elsewhere.It's sad that this doc lost momentum with hopes to gain distribution due to pandemic shutdowns. It deserves better. It's very worthy of being on Netflix. Give it the time it deserves.",False
15,10,A Great Look into the Furry Fandom,telosmccloud,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end. It's gives a detailed look into the sub-culture fandom of Sci-Fi, known as the Furry Fandom. Great production, very clear and concise. Highly recommend to anybody who is interested in learning more about this generally misunderstood fandom.",False
16,10,I like it!,cannonwilliamsphone,n/a,15/08/2025,"I like this because it is a great jumping off point for anyone interested in the furry fandom. Seriously, if you are even remotely interested, give this one a watch, you wont regret it!",False
17,10,How Subculture Should Be Documented!!,sarahegillis,n/a,15/08/2025,"So just finished watching The Fandom, and I'm just absolutely stunned by its high production value and the respectful nature to which the film approached this subculture.Even if you're not a Furry, it's a highly enlightening and enjoyable to watch. It was kind of cool to learn about the first anime club in the United States and watch the old footage of scifi conventions from way back in the 80s and 90s.",False
18,10,Informative & Helpful!,tberg-73439,n/a,15/08/2025,"Many people, including my own parents, misunderstood this community. They thought it was some weird fetish filled with less-than-savory individuals. But The Fandom explains very well what the community is all about, which provided a means for people that jumped to conclusions via misinformation and negative media to open their minds a bit! Showing this to those who wonder what the fandom is about is the best way for them to learn, in my eyes. As for the negative reviews, I do partially understand where they are coming from-- this isn't a multi-million dollar project. It's undoubtedly an indie film, and despite the significant lack of resources, the small team that produced this documentary did a great job in my eyes!",False

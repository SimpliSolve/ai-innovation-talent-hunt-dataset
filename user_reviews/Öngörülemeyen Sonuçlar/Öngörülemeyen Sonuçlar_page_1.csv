1,10,"""It Was So Much More Than I Expected""",Chrislee_UK,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love the Half-Life universe, this documentary offers not just information, but a deep emotional experience. As someone who played the games years ago, I noticed details here that I had never picked up on before. The creator doesn't approach the subject with academic distance, but with genuine passion-and you can feel that in every frame.It doesn't just retell the story; it boldly explores the philosophy behind Half-Life, its subtext, and political commentary. The narration is both poetic and clear, which makes it truly unique.From the meaning of the G-Man to the power of silence, I found myself saying ""wow"" at multiple points. The visuals, sound design, and voiceover come together to create something that feels more like a film than a typical documentary. Whoever made this has truly lived through Half-Life.",False
2,10,Unbelievable,Furkan-800,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched it for 2.30 hours holding my breath. Both the cast system and the visuals are really impressive. The storytelling is really effective and very successful. The music they use makes you connect to the story more while watching. The tone of voice they use while telling the story makes it easier to enter the created world. I guarantee that players and viewers who are fond of the Half-Life universe will watch it without blinking. This production, which I have been watching repeatedly lately and learning different details every time I watch it, really made me feel different emotions in every way.",False

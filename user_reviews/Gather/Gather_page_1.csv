1,7,Well done but subtle politicization not needed,stark-65910,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed this documentary. Heritage and roots are important and the first people to our continent have a rich and vibrant history. That history and culture is a valuable part of healing. I loved the focus on food and gathering, and the ancient ways to gather and prepare as part of bringing people together.With out a doubt our indigenous neighbors were grossly mistreated, horrifically so, and I too would categorize much of it as a form of genocide.Colonization though would require that our continent have actually been and established country and it was not. It was populated by a multitude of hunter-gatherer people group/ 'nations', possibly over 500, with no established country. They were moving around following food sources much as all of early people did, resulting in continual migration.The early settlers to arrive were not intent on 'conquering' or taking over another country. Many were fleeing persecution, many 'migrating' also looking for a better life, many looking for resources and wealth. Whatever the reason the lands they arrived at had no established country to take over.Mankind has moved all over since the beginning of mankind. It is unconscionable that disregard for fellow humans can become part of that and greed and evil also an element. There are no excuses for that but the word colonization is far over used. Invade might even be a better word!Lastly - the demise of the Buffalo was not a single intentional effort by the 'colonizers' . It was a conundrum of many things and indigenous tribes had a hand in that demise as well, as with the introduction of the horse, and fire power, hunters had a huge advantage and could harvest far more Buffalo. Add in the demand for hides even overseas accelerated the slaughtering. There were a very few 'officials' that saw killing Buffalo as a means to weaken the 'indigenous enemy' and that was very few and isolated.I loved the segment on the re-establishment of Buffalo as well as the efforts by Miss Dubray as to the superior health benefits of bison. A bright young woman with much to offer and a bright future. Bison are being reestablished where I live as well and we buy bison annually from a rancher that range feeds. Nothing compares.All in all the documentary is excellent but the politics could have been omitted.",False
2,10,Please watch this film,ckonopacky,n/a,16/08/2025,"History isn't supposed to be a happy story. The problem is that people think the point of learning about the negatives that happened is to make people feel guilty. But that's not the case. It's for us to take collective ownership of mistakes our country has made so that we learn and grow. This film helped me to understand and grow, and it can help you too.",False
3,10,Wonderful,foxconvey,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wonderful. Please watch the documentary. It will likely expand your understanding. My only wish is for it to be longer! I want to know more about this community and what the need, what the long for, what they love.",False
4,10,Very Enlightening,kevinodonnell-28212,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this documentary. It was highly enlightening and uplifting. Indigenous peoples can be proud of this program, as well as anyone who can empathize with their current plight.",False
5,4,Enough Blame-game,leshank-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Souix, Apache
All very violent tribes against other native tribes. Because they were the last violent, native conqueror of their land, does that make them better than the white conquerors? I'm all about them trying to reestablish their culture. Do it with initiative rather than blame.",False

1,6,Almost good,telecaster-492-31641,n/a,16/08/2025,"Part that elaborates on Bohm's scientific efforts is quite good. Metaphysical (wholeness) part I don't like. Not that I think it's not relevant, quite contrary, I think it is relevant and I find it interesting subject, especially in conjunction with physics and psychology. It's just that don't think it is done well by the director/producer. Something is missing.",False

3,10,A must-watch for anyone interested in the mysteries of reality and the nature of existence.,fcorreamautz,n/a,16/08/2025,"A captivating documentary that explores the life of physicist David Bohm and his groundbreaking ideas on quantum physics and interconnectedness. One of the film's strengths is its emotional depth, as it explores Bohm's personal struggles-his experiences with McCarthyism, his exile, and his philosophical journey. The interviews with renowned scientists, philosophers, and spiritual leaders, such as the Dalai Lama, provide diverse perspectives on Bohm's work and its implications for humanity. These conversations emphasize how Bohm's vision of a unified and interconnected universe remains relevant today, especially in the context of the current global crises where collaboration and unity are needed. These aspects make Bohm not just a brilliant scientist, but a deeply human figure striving to understand the world and our place within it.",False

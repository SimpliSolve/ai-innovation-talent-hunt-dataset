1,7,Odd,cgiant-18967,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a good WW1 documentary, but has nothing to do with the 1917 movie. The title is quite misleading. Nonetheless, this one showed more footage of the war than I've seen in other WW1 docs, though some is clearly re-enactments done at the time. The doc also nicely outlines most of the main battles of the war as well as the successes and losses of the Allies. It also goes into far more detail on the use and impact of tanks than I've seen before. It also includes far
More successes by the Allie's than I knew had actually happened in the war. It makes the Allie's look less bumbling then most docs.",False
2,1,"Sad attempt to undeservedly profit from the movie ""1917""",btffhrtdx,n/a,16/08/2025,"This ""documentary"" is such a sad, lazy attempt to make money by associating itself with the very good film ""1917"". It's just a regurgitation of commonly available of film footage and historical accounts of World War I. Most notable is that the makers made no attempt to clean up the historical footage, either by adjusting the frame rates to make the action appear as it would in real time, or by enhancing the resolution. There is no original content. Current technology allows for the easy creation of moving maps that can illustrate the events on a battlefield over time, but none such are included in this farce. Had they been, this could have been a really informative and enlightening film. Even the dialogue sounds like it was taken verbatim from a high school history textbook written by a high school history teacher. Everyone who received money for being involved in this so-called ""documentary"" should be ashamed of themselves. Shame! Pathetic.",False

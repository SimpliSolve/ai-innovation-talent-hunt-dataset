1,10,So underrated you can't believe it,lindelagibson,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is so charming, i've watched it two times now and i find it a bit hard to understand why no one ever talks about this movie. It's as much a movie about a couple of young guys hanging out as a drama about blood, sweat and tears.I did'nt expect much going into this movie but i got out with so much more than i would ever expect from a film about longboarding.But i get it, this is probably not for everyone but i would have no problem seeing this become a cult classic in the future. The cameras, music, editing and overall feeling it creates is unique and all the people are so very loveable. Overall, good job!",False
2,2,"Great intentions, poorly executed",mariar-49828,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why leave all the bad stuff in and moan so much but only give us a glimpse of the good stuff?! This was mostly about complaining, not about accomplishing something extraordinary and meeting amazing, generous people on the way.I would have loved to have seen the bit in Baltimore, or more about how people took you in.Also, there was barely any skating in the movie (at least that's how it felt). In the end it felt I wasted almost an hour watching a film about spoilt, privileged, unprepared, unlikeable Brits who are mainly complaining and wishing they were back home.Why do this in the first place if you cannot even attempt to find any joy in the experience...",False

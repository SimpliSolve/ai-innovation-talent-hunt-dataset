1,7,"Great show, awful host",notanotherxerox,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love this show, except for Nancy Grace, and her calling kids ""tot girl"" like the episode on ""Delta Dawn"" the formerly unidentified toddler found dead, her awful makeup, and the repeated parts of the story. They really have enough information, there doesn't need to be a host, especially not Nancy Grace who I find so harsh & unsympathetic. And get her a new makeup artist. I never thought those type of things, like ""catchphrases"" or makeup would make me poorly review a show but with Nancy Grace apparently it does, een her voice feels very uncaring. I know she's done good work &has a sad past that got her into crime but she takes away from the good work of this show.",False
2,6,Grace is like Nails on a Chalkboard!,greenidgirl95,n/a,16/08/2025,"She constantly uses the wrong grammar.""Sex Assault"" instead of Sexual Assault
""Tot"" instead of child
I have to fast forward through every part she's talking and watch the parts she's not talking.She may be smart, but she's not made for TV.The only reason I deal with the anxiety I get when she talks is to get to the important information in the show.Someone else needs to take her spot and this could actually be a great show to watch.Also, I think it's season one, but she recorded the whole season in one day. I know this because I binged watched it and her clothes, hair etc never changed. SMHThis could be a really great show if she was replaced. She doesn't have the it factor or sense of empathy that should be felt by the audience when she's talking. It seems more like courtroom drama.",False
3,8,"love the science, not the cast",frieda-92366,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most of the cases are interesting, some are incredible. But with Nancy Grace and Brian Oxman narrating, it comes across as a carny show. They are not even master showmen, just fools gold with a little glittter that masquerades as the real thing. I can tolerate Grace because everyone knows her heavy-handedness is her trademark, and her elaborate and somewhat bizarre makeup (like red eyeliner) and the way she forces exaggeration on the viewer is just part of the show. Oxman, though, is a puffy-eyed bag of gas who should have bowed out with his supposed client Michael Jackson. Now I know why he was disbarred.The crime here is these are real crimes, real suffering families, really hard work by 100's of investigators and detectives, and the show is a great public service announcement to share your DNA...but Grace and Oxman insist on beating their own drums. As if the show is an advertisement for their outrageous and overblown personalities. Buffoons. It is shameful. Whoever did the casting should be stripped of the right to ever cast another show.Also, the cascade of rushing music in the background is annoying and detracts from the narrative. I admit, I'm half way through season three and will continue to watch till the end. But that is despite Grace and Oxman, not because they add anything of value to the show.",False
4,n/a,Nancy Grace is the worst detective show host ever!!!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Please get Nancy Grace off this show! First of all, her awful red eye liner is the worst makeup I have ever seen in a tv show! What are the producers thinking??? It really looks like a Halloween makeup and she has a scarry look. Frankenstein or a vampire comes to mind when watching, really!!! It just takes the focus off the program! But most important is the awful and bad narrative, she completely destroys the show! When I watch the episodes, I can't enjoy what is being said because Nancy Grace is the worst show host ever!!! She always talks as a very angry and frustrated person. We can not try to listen to what is being said because of her tone!!! She justs ruins this wonderful detective show!!! I love the topics and the way all detectives explain what happened, and how it was solved, but Nancy Grace sucks! Can't you get a better show host like the ones on Dateline or On the case with Paula Zhan??? Please get Nancy Grace off this wonderful detective show because she justs completly ruins it and I would just like to enjoy the program for what it really is. I sincerly think you are losing loads of watchers! I wish I could enjoy the program with an adequate host!!!",False
5,6,Audio,mdbcorpz,n/a,16/08/2025,I love the shows!but seriously the background music is louder than the people narrating! Can some fix this? Thanks!,False
6,10,STOP THE MUSIC!!!,sherryrw58,n/a,16/08/2025,"The reason for my 10 rating appears after my rant and rave.PLEASE stop the music and unecessary moderators! Why, oh why, do television shows insist on the loud, driving, irritating, DISTRACTING music throughout the show??? I have been unable to watch many interesting shows because I cannot tolerate the annoying, pointless background music. Why do we need a ""host""? Why don't we need an appropriate host if we must have one? Nancy Grace adds nothing and, in fact, is a huge negative. She does not convey empathy or the solemnity of the topics, she speaks like the National Enquirer, she's loud, and for whatever reason she appears almost as a caricature of a series host. She has no function or expertise that I can see or hear. If it has to do with being a former prosecutor, it doesn't show and doesn't make her a scientist. She has nothing to do with the cases, crimes, or anyone involved. It makes me crazy to watch and listen to her just repeat what's already been said in a sensationalist tone of voice.With that said, I find the topic of genetic genealogy extremely interesting, particularly as it applies to solving crimes. The cases covered are wide ranging and really show how incredible this technology truly is. It's worth watching - I just turn the volume low and the sub-titles on.",False
7,5,Red Eyes,drdtx,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show itself is fascinating with the technology used to catch these criminals. The host though is horrible and makes it difficult to watch the entire program. I see several comments about her so called pink eyeliner but I just watched an episode and she clearly has black eyeliner. What she does have is extremely red eyes. My husband made the comment that she looks like she smokes that wacky tobaccy stuff. I'm inclined to agree. That could also explain her overdramatic way of speaking. She really does sound like she's reporting for the National Enquirer or some other sensationalist publication which is sad since these cases are very serious, sober, and heartbreaking. When the day comes that she's replaced, I'll give this show a higher rating.",False
8,10,LOVE LOVE LOVE BLOODLINE DETECTIVES & NANCY GRACE!!,pamsmith-58423,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love this show especially to see Nancy Grace again on TV!! I always watch all the Dateline, 48 hrs., and all crime shows on Oxygen but Bloodline is far better and exciting than all of them combined! Can't believe you don't have more reviews listed but wanted to add my 2 cents worth.Keep up the great work Nancy! Miss seeing you on the National networks...their loss!",False
9,3,GET RID OF GRACE!!,aprilfromolalla,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love science-based crime solving. DNA advances are inevitable and challenging on all fronts - ethical, moral, legal, etc. This ""genetic genealogy"" is like reverse engineering, which is interesting. The show, however, has lost it for me. I really liked Season 1. But Season 2 is awful. Nancy Grace is horrid. Her drama is nauseating and I honestly cannot think of WHY the producers of this show felt they needed to put her in front of the camera. I cannot watch her or listen to her. When she talks, I mute the show. I cannot look at her for more than a second because of the pink eyeliner, HEAVY makeup, and just the way she talks; it's like using a sledgehammer to drive in a tack!! Other peeves about this show are the snippets of scenes (like the lab workers) constantly being recycled, the music, and Nancy's terms like ""sex attack"". Whaaat?",False
10,10,STOP BOUNCING YOUR HEAD,bc-beckman,n/a,16/08/2025,"We LOVE the show. Both of us are experienced film and video actors. The camera is a Magnifying Lens! Make TINY movements for emphasis, NOT giant bounces of your head. It looks like you're going to break your neck! Great Voice. JUST STOP MOVING SO MUCH! YIKES! One one-hundredth of the bounce would make the point! The content, flow, delivery is fine. Your slight Tennessee / Missouri / whatever accent has a lot of charm. Your makeup and hair is improving from one season to another. But seriously, watch yourself! You can't move so BIG like that. On Stage, YES, on video NO! Please please please fix this!",False
11,10,Very interesting show,laurali-20838,n/a,16/08/2025,I love this show. Sadly these criminals are already dead when the familial DNA is run. You want them to pay.For those who make bad comments about Nancy Grace she was a prosecutor at one time and host a few crime shows which I like her. Maybe she is forward and blunt like me. She is much better host than Paula Zahn.But who does Nancy Grace makeup for this show it is aweful. Fire her makeup artist please. It looks like she has droppy lower eyes with pink liner. Please improve her makeup if she is going to host.She is very forward and may seem aggressive but that's how all her shows are.I think this show tells differant aspect of crimes but really digging further into dna.,False
12,5,"Sexual assault, NOT sex attack",andersonkrista-85488,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love this type of program. The advances in genetics is something I find fascinating. I do recommend watching this program for the science it includes.What ruins it for me is Nancy Grace. Each time the episode starts I hope it isn't an episode involving rape because Nancy will inevitable use the inaccurate phrase ""sex attack"" which is like nails on a chalkboard.Please use proper terminology as failure to do so makes Nancy sound ignorant. I know she is an intelligent professional woman so this is doing her a disservice.If you can ignore the poor grammar, I do think this show is worth watching.",False
13,8,"Great Show, HORRIBLE Host!!",AmberB-64,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nancy Grace is so obnoxious. Seriously, she's like nails on a chalkboard. Her use of incorrect terms like ""sex attacked"" or ""sex assaulted"" cheapens the show. I love the rest of the series so it's just unfortunate that such a poor choice of host was made. FFS can she please stop with the silly ""tot"" stuff, it takes away from the serious show content. Also, if you must use an already terrible host choice, shell out for a makeup artist. That red eyeliner is crazy. She just really detracts from the show. Whoever decided she would be a great host, should definitely be reprimanded. It was an awful choice.",False
14,2,Ok but replace Nancy Grace,lalabaughman,n/a,16/08/2025,This show is great but they ripped off The Genetic Detective show. Replace Nancy with the other lady and it would be great!,False
15,10,It's HERE!,davislaurie,n/a,16/08/2025,Been binging since i found this program - & realized that it wasn't a dream! Guess really i am still a newbie but i have & do watch LOTS of true crime shows lately. Getting kind of numb to the similar stories over & over. Only time i'd perk up is when a scenario would involve phenotyping & genetic genealogy - all of that DNA stuff that we've been waiting for forever! I have been DREAMING of a program like this! Lol meanwhile it was already HERE! I've already binged what i had missed!Ps what's so bad about Nancy Grace?! One of my pet peeves is narrators who are monotonous. She is certainly not that!Pss think maybe that Nancy is wearing hot pink eyeliner underneath which probably looks way cooler irl. At least i hope so bc if not she's likely very sick.,False
16,1,Why does the host put pink eyeliner on her bottom eyelids?,auntiescrafts,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why does the host put pink eyeliner on her bottom eyelids?First of all, you we don't need another disgusting crime shows it shows why mostly a bunch of women are murderedThere's too many of themBut even if I wanted to watch one this lady that's hosting looks like she has pink eyeSomebody please, put some dark eyeliner on her and stop thinking that it's cute to highlight her eyes with pink on the bottom..
It's not! It looks horrible.",False
17,1,S2 Ep10 San Bernardino Bodies description is INCOMPLETE,find_lilian,n/a,16/08/2025,"In addition to the first time, the following should be mentioned (feel free to rewrite).Her mother and a male traveling companion had been hitchhiking across the US, and were the first two bodies discovered buried in the Mojave Desert outside unincorporated Ludlow in San Bernardino county, California. Later 3 more bodies, that of a male (Bobby Neal), and two females (Bobby's daughter Mary Jo, and MaryJo's cousin) were also discovered buried in the Mojave by Zene County Sherriff., and were identified by local family as missing. Eventually all 5 murders were attributed to Howard Neal, Bobby's half-brother, who hung around the truck stop where hitchhikers passed through. And the unidentified male traveling companion was traced to a family in Virginia using forensic genealogy help of the FBI.",False
18,3,WHAT A DIS-GRACE SHE IS.,juliev-71155,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm so torn on how many stars to give this show. The topic of genetic genealogy is fascinating, the pace of the show is (mostly) great, and i, like most of America, am obsessed with True Crime shows. The interviews with the detectives, scientists, and families of the victims are a mix of emotions and extremely gripping. BUT... Grace is a nightmare!!She ruins the whole flow of every episode! There seriously is no reason for her or her input. Nancy offers nothing of value to any episode! She uses wrong phrasing (sex attack instead of sexual assault, etc), and as a former ""prosecutor"" and TV ""personality"", she 100% knows better- she just doesn't care because she thinks it's attention grabbing and makes her a no nonsense whatever she's trying to be. Added to all that she repeats ""violent sex act"" or ""brutal sex crime"" a hundred times every episode. WE GET IT!! STOP FOCUSING ON THAT BIT. She has been dis-Gracing (see what I did there 😏) my television since Casey Anthony and ""tot"" should have been left in Florida. Speak like you've been educated woman!The camera is so close to her face, and her voice is like knives on glass. I mute the TV every time she opens her mouth. She has zero personality, empathy, or anything of the sort, and when she pretends to care, or that she's touched, or that she has feelings it seems fake, rehearsed, and contrived. Her eyes and lack of facial expressions make her seem intoxicated. She absolutely needs to go!! Literally ANYONE ELSE would be an improvement!! I'd rather listen to Ben Stein all day every day than an hour of her.The problem? She's the producer. So why won't they get rid of her? Because she's the horrible boss who doesn't care what viewers think. She's gonna keep right on at it. All with the camera 6 inches from her bloodshot eyed, head bobbing, voice waaaay too loud, wrong phrasing, repetitive self. Imagine how awesome this show (all of television for that matter) would be, if she took a hiny and retired?Produce the show all you want Nancy, but do it without subjecting the viewers to you. We've definitely had enough and you've worn your welcome.P. S.- Ava Hartly?? Pink is NOT her color. It's horrid on her bloodshot, watery eyes. I don't know what the solution is, and I bet Nancy is a PEACH to work for, but do something. Maybe it would look a tad better if the camera people would scoot back about 50 feet.",False
19,n/a,Say it correctly...,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,PLEASE look at the word GENE-A-LOGY.It's NOT GENE-O-LOGY. It drives me crazy that Americans say it incorrectly when the spelling is OBVIOUS. FFS get it right.I love this show but am driven crazy by people saying the word incorrectly. Even the narrator who is obviously English says it incorrectly.The advances in DNA and the advent of databases with millions of DNA results is an absolute game changer in solving crimes. If only all DNA evidence had been preserved until this technology became available. Kudos to those who managed to preserve DNA specimens from the past so that they could be used at this moment in time.,False

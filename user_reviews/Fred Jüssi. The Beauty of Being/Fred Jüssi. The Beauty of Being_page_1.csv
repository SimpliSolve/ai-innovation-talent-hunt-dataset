1,10,a philosophical aesthetic film in which everyone will find something for themselves,janesnowflake,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerToday we watched a wonderful film by Jaan Tootsen, dedicated to the life and work of Fred JÃ¼ssi and his concept of fruitful idling. I can say with confidence that among all the films we watched, this one resonated in my soul the most, because it was devoted to the beauty, acceptance of oneself and the world around us, and eternity in all its hypostases. Despite the fact that the film was consecrated to a man who popularized nature in Estonia and was positioned as a documentary, it seemed to me more comprehensive and philosophical.It is not surprising that his work has become a revolution in the perception of nature because even now people very often do not notice the beauty around them amid everyday worries and troubles, and after all, it is worth stopping for a minute. I also really liked the idea of loneliness fear, because at such moments people are deeply immersed in themselves, listening to their true thoughts and feelings, and here it is very important to just trust in your life course.I was particularly delighted with the aesthetics and atmosphere of the shooting. Each frame, production, and idea of the film seemed to lead the viewer through the life cycle of each person. I was impressed by the allegory of the beginning of a new stage of life as a new season and the scene with the opening of the doors to the house emphasized this metaphor. I am always fascinated by being in nature, because I feel calm, unity with myself and the world around me, and I clearly understand what kind of living silence Fred is talking about, because I, like him, consider the sounds of water a kind of satisfaction. The change of images of misty dawn and sunset, the moment of the flight of small dragonflies, the owl's communication, how funny a caterpillar eats a flower - all these small particles made the film a real photographic masterpiece. It seems to me that every look of the hero was permeated with love, delight, and gratitude, he seemed to have disappeared into nature.The whole movie filled me with the warmth and tenderness that I feel when I come to my grandmother's countryside or when my dad and I go for mushrooms or when you run through the cold dew in the morning. All this is about a moment of quiet happiness, freedom of feelings, disconnection from the outside world, and love for life and its every instant.",True

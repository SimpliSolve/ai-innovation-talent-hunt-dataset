2,9,What a waste..,mike-332-96002,n/a,16/08/2025,"Certainly! Here's an expanded version of your review:The ""making of"" highlights the immense potential this show once had. If it had stayed true to the source material and followed the stories in the books, we could have witnessed something extraordinary. Instead, the essence of The Witcher was gradually pushed aside, leaving us with a series that only bears the name but lacks its heart.What a squandered opportunity. Henry Cavill's dedication to the role, his extensive training, and his understanding of Geralt as a character were exceptional-assets any production would dream of. Yet, even with such a powerful foundation, the show strayed, leaving behind the depth and complexity that made the books so loved.The budget was there, the talent, the fans, eagerly waiting to see the world of The Witcher come to life in all its glory. But instead of honoring those elements, they were wasted. What remains is a hollow shell of what could have been, and that's a true disservice not only to Henry Cavill but also to the audience who invested in this journey.In the end, The Witcher became ""Witcher"" in name only, a shadow of its potential.",False

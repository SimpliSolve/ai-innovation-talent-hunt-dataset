1,10,Inspirational with honesty and emotional highs and lows.,Sumovers,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't often enjoy documentaries about ultra running as they are often about gifted people.
Not so this film. It's a runner at the back, just making cut offs, falling apart physically and just so wanting something he is prepared to really hurt for the chance to be someone he wants to be. A 100 miler. To do it for his mom, who died of obesity related illness.
Two sides of the story, him on a gig doing a stand up and his journey to run a 100. The most inspirational thing is, he didn't totally transform in to some super trim ultra runner. He struggled and was still chubby, he wasn't perfect. We get to hear his inner struggles and his outward torments.
We run with him we see how it takes strength and dedication from him and his team. You realise that being at the back is so much more mentally challenging.
Recommend this film.",False
2,9,"Funny, inspirational, engrossing",rolfdenver,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this movie. It pulled me in and made me want to do something similar, without ever making it seem too easy. It was heartwarming and made me feel the pain and motivation of the main character. He is very funny, by the way, and I'd love to see him live once this damn coronavirus is behind us.I would have liked to have heard a little more about how he steadily increased his mileage, but it would probably have detracted from the flow of the story.",False
3,9,Honest and personal,ueprod,n/a,16/08/2025,Obesity is a problem many individuals have and often ignore. This doc tells the warming story of a man who decides to make a positive change in his life for passionate reasons. The film was well shot and edited. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in non-fiction filmmaking.,False
4,1,Frustrating film direction,tonydoyle-82646,n/a,16/08/2025,Brilliant story. But why they've made it into a low-budget-stand-up comedy is beyond me. Could have been really compelling and inspiring with some good directing/filmography... but unfortunately it comes across as annoying and needy of attention. Shame.,False
5,10,"Uplifting, funny, I'm ready to run!",Lea999,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved this doc. It's funny, heartwarming, and it goes to show that if you want to make a change no matter who or where you are or what you know, you can do it. And if you're a runner already you're going to love this. I'd you aren't a runner, your probably going to become one after you watch!",False
6,10,"Very entertaining, enjoyable movie....Jeff is an inspiration",lokiclv-04375,n/a,16/08/2025,"I decided to watch this movie because my husband does Ironman, Spartan and recently attempted his 1st 100 ultra. I was not able to be there when he tried. I was there afterwards for the aches, blisters and injuries and regrets of only reaching 50 miles. This was eye opening and inspirational. It truly shows what a person goes through when attempting to finish, failing to and trying again....and the humor of the journey.",False
7,10,Entertaining and inspirational,markgadie,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a runner and a returning ultra runner and I don't need to be inspired to run, but this film still does that.A mix of funny bits, inspirational bits with some sad parts too. Nice easy watch and one I fully recommend, be warned though you may want to run...and it's not as easy as I think this film kind of suggests; even though it does not suggest it's particularly easy! It certainly isn't easy to start running big distance from a standing start.",False

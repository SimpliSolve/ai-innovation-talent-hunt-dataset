1,10,Great,mikeiskorn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wonderfully put together a documentary! There are lots of different interviews from people who either saw a new Bob Marley. Lots of stories and anecdotes from people who were there and remember Bob and the gigs and time in the UK with fun memories. I would recommend this to anybody who is a fan of Bob Marley, and even those who aren't as it is such a good documentary with great old footage from the 70s reggae and punk scenes. Don Letts features heavily in this documentary, which is really nice because I like to hear his take on the punk era. The BBC really do a good job of documentaries like this together, and I hope they continue to do more.",False

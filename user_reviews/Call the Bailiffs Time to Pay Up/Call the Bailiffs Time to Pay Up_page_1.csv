1,6,The narrator is the worst I've ever heard,singit-35933,n/a,15/08/2025,The narrator talks like he's talking to a five year old. It's almost enough to stop me watching the program. Thankfully I recorded the program so I was able to wizz through most of him.,False
2,7,Narrator,imdbfan-246865,n/a,15/08/2025,"Has the phrasing of narrator on Thomas the Tank Engine. While fine for a kids programme, bit of an insult to viewers of Bailiffs programme. Makes it almost unwatchable.Programme itself is interesting but that narration almost put me off. Perhaps they'd be better doing Peppa Pig.Please have a rethink.",False
3,3,Frustrating to watch,carlmillward,n/a,15/08/2025,It's almost unwatchable because it jumps from one story to the next before the last one is concluded then returns to it later in the show. I have no idea why the programme makers think this improves the show. Just play out each story fully. I watched half an episode and had to turn it off.,False
4,1,"Bad, bad, bad",meredithjon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fat, overweight, usually bald headed, think themselves clever, above the law, snide, a-holes that try to force there way in to your property in any way they think they can. In the opening titles an American woman says we're human yet try to make an offer but it's always more they want of you (err commission based by any chance???). The police are no help, they work for us, the public, but now down to private companies like this. Its time to stand up against these bullies and shut them down.Clearly a fake office they're reporting to as well, please channel 5 we're a lot more clever than your giving us credit for. Cancel this rubbish please.",False
5,3,Cant Pay We'll Take it Away is better,chelseat-88559,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI am not sure of the reason to even have the baliffs, as the cops usually end up coming lol. Just send the cops. These are some of the worst female bailiffs I have seen. Smarmy gran and Casey run their mouths, shove people around and threaten them etc. Gran just talks smack in the van and cowers and calls for backup while Casey seemingly takes hours off from hassling drunks in a local pub to scream and shove and threaten. Often the payees will request to work with the other officer she is so low and abrasive. I don't really blame them. But in the end most of these folks are scammers and scumbags that take away from normal paying folks like us. Someone who has gone without and still paid bills has little sympathy for a person that bought range rovers and skipped rent for 3 years. Anyway there are a couple of other shows with better bailiffs and the stories aren't all chopped up to keep you on the hook and watch all of the cases. I had forgotten about this pile and the two bailiffs until it came up on stream today.",True
6,1,Grandma???,smudgeinc-12103,n/a,15/08/2025,"On the whole I like this program, however are we honestly meant to believe the grandmother with the bleached blonde hair is of any use? How is she going to do anything or be of any benefit/use in a conflict or confrontational situation? It's a joke, someone fitter and of better skills is being denied a decent job. I'm sure I'll probably get comments about my opinion, but why is an old aged pensioner being employed in career like that????!!?She just sits in the van and probably needs a Zimmer frame to get out of said van . As I mentioned I like this program and it does seem genuine, and the rest of the team are professional. Just my opinion.",False
7,1,Who on earth produces this,jptighe,n/a,15/08/2025,"Impossible to watch, jumping from one story to the next and then back again, constantly repeating what we have seen. Adverts are annoying but I get that from an unpopular channel. Don't know why you produce a program in this format, guessing it's done to try and keep all the out comes at the end so you watch it all. My god have you got that completely wrong it's just unwatchable. You really need to measure how many people turn over after 10 mins because it will be a lot. Such a shame as I like programs like this normally. Please have a re think on the format and do one story at a time. Thank you.",False

1,6,Dumb Money,rajitecture,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you followed GME during the pandemic, you'll enjoy this documentary. It really adds to the news stories during that time. What I really cringe about with this flick is how crazy these investors were. Gamestop is a dying business and the only reason why it went up was because of the revolution, not because there was research that suggested the company stock should be higher. These people should have been selling portions on the way up. A lot of these people just thought of selling or holding everything. For some, it was a terrible mistake. Be weary that this documentary doesn't take a neutral stance, but 100% favors the retail investors.",True
2,1,Terrible.,frostbyte-180-148473,n/a,17/08/2025,I guess they make movies about anything now; it was funny for a laugh but we turned it off after 20 minutes. We also thought the title was really stupid.,False
3,2,Horrible,Mustang92,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was a really piss-poor documentary about the GameStop short squeeze. Actually, it was hardly about that; if one knows little about it, you won't learn about it here. This was mostly talking heads of various retail buyers -- most of whom were boring as heck.Secondly, the timeline was horrible. There was a point when some pundit (or hedge fund person) said the stock was going to go to $20, but at this point, all we'd seen on screen was that it was rising from $15/$16/$17. We didn't know that when he said this, the stock was way above that. So the timeline of this film was crap, the editing sucked, and the directing was atrocious.And what was with all the B-roll of stupid stuff, like an astronaut getting ready and then the rocket taking off? All this horrible footage to break up the talking heads footage? Was this everyone's first film?? Apparently NBC News produced this, but OMG! What a piece of crap.Would have been nice to learn more about what only was brought up in the last 10 minutes, about how there may have been manipulation happening against the retail investors after some hedge funds lost big money. THAT is an important part of the story. Well, I guess there's a movie coming out on this shortly, so don't waste your time on this doc, check out the movie coming out soon, or read a book on this. Can't learn a thing from this lame film.",True

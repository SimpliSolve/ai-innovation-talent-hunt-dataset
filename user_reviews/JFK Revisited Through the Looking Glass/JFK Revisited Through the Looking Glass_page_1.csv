1,8,Frightening,billcr12,n/a,15/08/2025,Oliver Stone uses intrerviews and historical footage to make the case for a conspiracy in the assassination of JFK. The Zapruder film clearly shows Kennedy's head snap backwards. The emergency room doctors stated that the wounds were points of entrance at the front. This is a very detailed film and should be seen by every American.,False
2,7,Stone deserves tremendous credit. Great documentary.,morganmckinley,n/a,15/08/2025,"Unless you still think the media is on the level, then your eyes are wide enough to know it's a card trick they've been playing for years to deceive the public. And the Assassination of JFK is exhibit 1.For 64 years they've pushed the government's ludicrous story of the BS Warren Commission and jokes of human beings they prop up like Posner who support that idiotic story.The truth is we don't know exactly what happened but anyone who has taken the time to investigate it well enough, especially with documents and interviews online, they'll see too many questions unanswered or lied about to know LHO certainly had intelligence connections and we'll very likely never know who pulled the trigger.Whether you like JFK or not, the assassination led to many of the problems we face today and needs to be answered. Oliver Stone deserves tremendous credit for keeping these questions in the public eye.God Bless America...",False
3,9,Hopefully this will see the light of day in the US soon and not 10 years from now,mlbsa,n/a,15/08/2025,The question is which streaming service will have the cahonnes to show it? Thank you Oliver Stone for continuing the battle to get the truth out.,False
4,10,Think for yourself,RJBrez,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was excited for this documentary as it contains updated info. If you actually believe the Warren commission report, you probably won't like this. I am stunned that this farce (warren commission) was believed by anyone. Issues with the magic bullet, witness reports, evidence, the autopsy, all cannot be denied. This material is fascinating and Stone knows how to tie all of the information together for the viewer. Every time I delve into the JFK era, I learn something new. Hopefully you will too. Stone tears apart the government's narrative, piece by piece in this documentary. Of course this material will be divisive, but it raises some alarming questions/possibilities and leaves no doubt of a vast cover up and conspiracy that continues to this day. Here we are almost 60 years later, still waiting for information to be declassified. Some of this material is amazingly still a matter of ""national security"" says the government.We will never know what actually happened, that is clear. But I hope projects like these can both shed light on the past and help us in the future. Those responsible for tragedies need to be held accountable. I hope this film is educational for everyone, and lights a fire in others. Everyone should be angry about nonsense like this.",False
5,10,This is such an amazing documentary,sotopete,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie should be shown at school to every American citizen.The CIA should be reformed.This documentary is a tremendous work of investigation.Even the most obvious evidences are not changing this country which cannot self criticize. This arrogance leads to what is happening now, these infinite wars throughout the world, the assassinations, the drones killing of civilians.When the American people will stand up and say it is enough?",False
6,7,"For one time, i could have answered her with "" I'm fine: I watched an amazing documentary ! """,leplatypus,n/a,15/08/2025,"My diet of Pay Tv movies ended after 4 long empty months because as soon as I have noticed this Stone's return to JFK case on my channels, i knew that a good evening was ahead me. Last time I heard about it, it was for Deauville festival and i asked then: "" so now, who killed JFK?""The documentary fails to give an exact answer if you want names, occupations and strategy. However, as in his movie, Stone's opinion points towards the military complex and rogue CIA with help from FBI.But unlike the movie which was a fast paced fiction, here Stone slows down the tempo and let the footages run a long time. Several thematic are analysed: the bullets, the gun, the autopsy, New Orl√©ans, the bay of pigs, the international politics, the Vietnam,...At the end, it's an excellent, useful embellishment to the movie as both are about the same thing but deliver in different ways.What i keep is the feeling that JFK and 9/11 resonate with the same vibes: a national tragedy, a official report and a lot, much questions...And ice of the cake, this documentary achieves to learn me a new fact.. What happened in Chicago in August 1963 is indeed very chilly....",False
7,10,Thank you Oliver Stone only one telling the truth!!!,homegy,n/a,15/08/2025,"It has been clear for long time and this program shows that in less then 6 seconds, at least 3 different shooters fired at least 6 bullets causing 10 wounds in 3 different men that faithful day!1. First bullet missed the whole street and hit the road and piece of it hit a man standing there. First shooter! First wound!2. Second bullet from behind hit Kennedy in the back. Second shooter! Second wound.3. Third bullet also came from behind missed Kennedy and hit Connelly in the back. This bullet came through Connelly causing third and fourth wound. Same Second shooter!4. Fourth bullet came from the side rare and hit Connelly in the wrist went through and ended up in his leg causing fifth, sixth and seventh wound. This is probably first shooter that missed his first shot.5. Fifth bullet came from the front and hit Kennedy in the throat. Third shooter! Eighth wound.6. Sixth shot also came from the front possibly from the same third shooter and hit Kennedy in his right temple exiting at the back of his head behind his ear. Ninth and tenth wound.All these shots and wounds had to be concealed hence alterations to the body, secret controlled autopsy, destruction of evidence and pictures, murder and suppression of witnesses and disgusting farce of Warren so called commission. Definition of commission is ""choosing someone for a special piece of work to discover information and examine reasons..."" they did opposite they compressed information and hid reasons and invented theories to prove pre decided outcome.Johnson, Bush, Hoover, Nixon, Ford, Warren, Dulles ... were all in it ...",False
8,n/a,I have a dream ...,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thank you Oliver Stone for your steadfast pursuit of truth. I have no doubt that JFK would call you one of his close friends, if ever that opportunity would have presented itself.The CIA and the military industrial complex are responsible ... and in September 2001 they undertook another false flag.In 1939, also September, Nazi Germany conducted a false flag.History repeats because people are not taught the lessons and when they are, these lessons are not passed down properly.Our world can be a better place than we know, but for that to be truth, better people must be elected to lead with hope and justice. People like JFK and those that educate with truth like Oliver Stone.",False
9,7,Watch This While Taking Notes!,MortSahlFan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Pause it, research each point further. My one criticism is that they spend too much time on forensics and things many already know. I would check out ""The Jim Garrison Tapes"" which is free on YouTube and I would YouTube the late, great Mort Sahl who was the hub. He put Jim Garrison, Mark Lane, etc., on his show, and he was the reason Garrison got on The Tonight Show w/ Johnny Carson (after he told Carson he was working in New Orleans) and Mort had clout and believability, and put Carson on the spot, and all this is on YouTube. Mort also got Garrison a great Playboy interview because of his relationship with Hefner, and went on The Steve Allen Show with Garrison and Dornan. Check out the YouTube channel ""Loyal Opposition""",False
10,8,Love me some Ollie Stone,rukstar69,n/a,15/08/2025,I have always been a huge fan of Oliver Stone's work. He's done it again. A look into some new info from the JFK assassination. So many moving parts and so many inconsistencies with the Warren commission findings. Will we ever really know the truth? This might help you connect the missing dots.,False
11,7,Nothing really new.,mjbari3,n/a,15/08/2025,"I couldn't wait to see this documentary, and I must say I was disappointed. I have followed the JFK assassination since I was a little girl in 1977. I went to a symposium that Dr. Wecht held at Duquesne. I am more than a casual observer on the subject. If you have read the books and seen the (now removed) videos, you will be disappointed. If you are a casual researcher on the subject, you will probably be surprised. I don't understand why some things aren't mentioned, like Officer Craig's account of the Mauser rifle, or even a mention of Judith Baker.",False
12,10,Details a Coup in America in 1963,mikeshagoury,n/a,15/08/2025,"Phenomenal documentary highlighting recently released information by the government that shows that what we were told about JFK's assassination simply isn't true. Also has an interview with RFK Jr. In which he states that RFK wanted to transmit a message to the Soviets acknowledging that they weren't responsible and stating that the murder was the act of American right wing elements. Also noteworthy is that the film describes how the secret service destroyed documents in 1990's on their activities in Nov. Of 1963 and refused to certify that they disclosed all of their documents in the assassination. If Oswald did it, why all the secrecy? It doesn't add up.",False
13,7,"More JFK, but still not enough",kosmasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"This makes a good double bill with the movie JFK - also by Oliver Stone. It does have a few new things that have been uncovered in the meantime ... that is since the movie was released 30 years ago. Of course we still will not get totally satisfied. This again raises questions and cannot answer them all ... it can answer a few from the movie (we see clips from it here), but raises new ones too.Stone seems to have an obsession when it comes to JFK ... and maybe he is on to something. But maybe not... we know that a lot of things are possible and a few connections are being made ... but no overall conclusion can be made. Not yet at least ... but at least we get to see Oliver Stone wandering the streets ... and of course a lot of archive material and so forth.",False
14,5,"As a fan of Stone's original epic, this documentary follow-up/spiritual sequel of sorts doesn't really work.",Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've watched Alexander, W., and now this in the last few days. I'd like to be proven otherwise, but the guy has been missing a lot during the 21st century, it seems, and I say that as someone who really likes most of his 1980s and 1990s stuff.Take JFK. That movie's great. It was made about three decades on from the death of the titular figure, and then this documentary, also directed by Stone, is released about 30 years on from JFK.Regrettably, it retreads so much ground and does so less interestingly. Not only that, but JFK is more compelling as a look at obsession over being a look at the aftermath of the JFK assassination. With this being a documentary, it eschews much of that interesting personal stuff (Stone could've done it if he'd wanted to be more self-critical, as he places himself in this documentary at times) and becomes about endless details.Those details were still interesting in JFK, and have been in other documentaries. This documentary doesn't really make it work, and feels like it lazily plays the hits (and not the best hits) from Stone's better JFK film. There are bursts of interesting things in here, and it's not terribly presented, but much of it's both a bore and a disappointment. Perhaps even worse, I'm right on the line of saying it doesn't really find a good reason to exist in the first place. It feels like Stone pumping out content, Netflix style, and it's a bit sad, really.",False
15,9,Sad but true,PiotrxxxDenmark,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sad it is that a crime in this scale never has been sufficiently solved, but true it is that a succesful coup often is uncovered a long time after - if ever.Stone had to do this movie - and there is more to present. This is a case that has to be solved, has to be written into the US history, if this land ever shall overcome itself. Founded on violence, baptised in blood and still reproducing both.",False
16,9,How we got here,dbarrydinkins,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you want to know how America got to where we are now this is a good place to start. Intelligence agencies determining foreign policy, picking and unpicking presidents. It all begins with JFK. The military industrial complex get rid of him, cover it up, and start a war.",False
17,n/a,22 Nov 1963,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this documentary, such awful piece of history. This is great informative documentary with interviews by some of the amazing knowledgeable authorities on the JFK assassination.I learnt and it's interesting to know that Lee Harvey Oswald was actually something other than what I was led to believe for so many years.Another masterpiece from a great director historian, Oliver Stone!",False
18,7,Loved it,laurenrandy,n/a,15/08/2025,It's a necessary and important addition to all the films about the coup and coverup.And of course the critics payed no attention to it. And the ones that did.... Puhlease.Thank you Oliver Stone for your contribution to society. Your time on earth has been incredibly important.,False
19,6,Why Oliver???,dillymac25,n/a,15/08/2025,Great documentary and well reviewed... everyone doing their homework... it's obvious that it was a conspiracy and the death of trust in our government... but why Whoopi Goldberg???Wrecked it for me...,False
20,9,Crazy revelations,otiscevans,n/a,15/08/2025,Left me with a feeling of dread. The info is sobering and the presentation wasn't showy or cheap so i wasn't distracted by it. It's surreal knowing that the world could actually be like something out of a Jack Ryan movie.,False
21,6,More detail but still only skin deep.,davegfrancis,n/a,15/08/2025,"Oliver Stone produces a very capable and considered re-examining of the JFK assassination but as always omits important details and never explores the known connection with the Mafia. It's a good documentary for any fan of the subject matter, but as always told from a very partisan political view. Still viewed through pro-Democrat eyes despite making points about Alabama Governor George Wallace and conveniently not mentioning the fact he was a democrat. So many uses of the term ""right-wing"" in a negative context despite the now obvious realization that the deep state has no bias, but rather a desire for complete control and power. Some interesting details unearthed but unfortunately it is more a love letter to Kennedy that falls short because despite the volumes of evidence to illicit a re-examination and determination, the people have sadly expired and I don't think America truly has the stomach to open those wounds. Worth a watch I you like the subject, but perhaps not compelling enough for the casual viewer.",False
22,9,A must watch if you haven't read many books.,bmxmans,n/a,15/08/2025,"All of the one star reviews are hit piece reviews. This is a high-end well produced and fact based look at the JFK Conspiracy. There are lots of video interviews as well as supporting documents. My only problem with it is it doesn't say what happened to the initial witnesses. Most of the initial witnesses that were on film died within 3 years. I believe it was 19 of 23, but I can't remember exactly, look it up. Why did both Trump and Biden push the document release dates back? What is there to hide or whom to protect after all these years. There is a rot in our Gov that needs to be cut out.",False
23,6,Inadvertently Reveals The Real Coverup,outpix,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerConspiracies exist because of coverups. Coverups exist because of CYA (cover your ass). Oswald had so many connections to the CIA that the intelligence community panicked and immediately went into cover up mode, because of the implications. This explains the chaos at the autopsy and the resulting control of access to information. Oswald was delusional and angry at the US for what he interpreted as basically using him. I was disappointed in Looking Glass not addressing the rumble seat in JFK's car which explains the magic bullet. Ballistics done over and over again have shown Kennedy's wounds were consistent with the Warren Commission (although that was basically a white wash). And as other reviewers have pointed out, there is not much new here. There's no mention of Oswald's previous assassination attempt on a US General. Conveniently leaving out and not addressing key facts makes this just a so so watch.",True
24,5,"I would have given it a 10, if it weren't for that clown Whoopi.",bjstratton,n/a,15/08/2025,Why would you use someone so against America and our traditional values to probe something that is a national tragedy? Most people who know the JFK story and it's potential theories wouldn't be caught dead around any of her work.. I just don't get the oversight? Otherwise it's a great film.,False
25,8,Sobering Unraveling of Industrial Military Complex Involvement,serendigity,n/a,15/08/2025,"For many decades I have believed that Kennedy posed a serious risk to the ongoing profitability of the huge military industrial complex. This doco slowly unravels the public record documents, interviews and obfuscated evidence and skilfully lays the facts clearly so there can be no mistaking the implications of what happened back in 1963. Kennedy was killed to ensure the far right establishment rich could get even richer for generations to come. Everything that has occurred in the USA since, all the conflicts and wars and foreign policy, has occurred with the manipulative intervention of the iron grip of this military industrial complex wealthy elite through their lobbyists, politicians they have placed into office, and the senior military advisers groomed for their roles.",False

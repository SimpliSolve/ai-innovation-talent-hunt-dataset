1,6,Heartbreaking episode,natbro96,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this for the first time tonight, season 2 episode 3 and it broke my heart and shocked me.The lad who was murdered, Jayden was in the wrong place at the wrong time. So young and from interviews with friends and family a happy, funny nice lad.Such a senseless loss.Killed by thugs out for revenge in a drive by and shot this innocent young lad who was at a house by chance and never been there before. Was there for about 8 minutes before he was shot!Then there was the dispatcher who hung up on the young person who rang for help because he couldn't cope with the person on the other end of the phone call who was clearly in shock and panic at seeing their friend bleeding too death,
That 911 call was chilling.My heart just broke for Jaydens family, friends and girlfriend.I do recommend this tv show but if all the episodes are about young innocent people like this one, then have tissues and prepare yourself. Any life taken is shocking and sad but when it's young people who are not even beginning to live life it just rips your heart that little bit more.",True
2,5,"This is a good program, but too much police bashing.",mish_mell,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm new to this show, so I've seen just a few episodes. In the first two that I watched, I didn't notice the anti-police comments. But the program definitely wants the viewers to know their opinion of law enforcement...to the point it's mentioned numerous times throughout the show. The police were incompetent; the officers didn't care; evidence was ignored or disregarded...etc. We the viewers are intelligent enough to form our own opinions, and labeling all law enforcement as ""bad"" is irresponsible. And as a ""journalist,"" the host should be held to a higher standard of reporting and represent ALL sides of the story, not just the one that underscores his own feelings.",False
3,10,Gets better every episode,laurafletcher-70062,n/a,15/08/2025,"Definitely think the other reviewers should have watched more than one or two episodes before writing this show off. It 100% gets better with each one they make.
Love Dometi and love how Nev intrudes the show.
Hope they make more.",False
4,1,First 2 episodes not great at all.,jchristoffersen-40991,n/a,15/08/2025,"As another reviewer has mentioned, the first episode answers itself in the first 10 seconds of explaining what ""crime"" happened, which was tragic but definately not worth an episode. granted episode 2 is better than the first, it is highly dramatized and they go over the same information time and time again for what seems just to make the episode long enough- i'm sorry to everyone who worked on the show, the host journalist is actually really good, but that is basically the only positive thing i can say about this show. definately not worth a watch. and what the heck is the guy from MTV's Catfish doing in this show? he only serves the purpose of talking for 20-30 seconds before each episode with lots of weird headmovement and eyecontact with the camera.",False
5,8,Show Some Respect,patricia-haertlein,n/a,15/08/2025,"How many crime series shows showcase young people of color, possibly disenfranchised, most likely overlooked by mainstream media? ID network isn't there in most cases. The First 48 makes the grade, but this platform addresses a younger audience. I respect this effort and appreciate quality product. These stories are real and real life.",False
6,1,Awful - giving platform to fake news,johnstonbradford-393-799906,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first episode was essentially a write off. A close and shut case of a horrible accident but the family is seriously delusioned thinking foul play was involved in any way. They tried to make this case a platform for their race issues which totally is offensive considering the hard work put in by the police. We will see what happens with the next episode but the first was embarrassing and didn't depict a ""true crime"" story at all. What is the purpose of the program ?",False
7,10,Love this,kelishajones,n/a,15/08/2025,I have never liked documentaries but these episodes get me hooked with curiosity. Every week I waited for a new episode and when it came out I watched it straight away. Loved it from the start,False
8,1,True Life Garbage,kissmyasthma-95598,n/a,15/08/2025,"As soon as I saw MTV, I knew there would never be anything that even comes close to the truth. The first episode doesn't even have a crime! It's the family believing it MUST be a crime. Talk about denial. Episode two is nothing more than head shots of Catfish eyeballing the camera. Not sure what that has to do with a crime. But then that's most likely MTV thinking all of America is nothing more than illiterate tweens. I love a good documentary, unfortunately, this isn't one of them. Not even close. MTV should stick to what it does best, fool teenagers into giving them money.",False
9,3,"True Life, apparently, but Not Crime",anthonyjlangford,n/a,15/08/2025,"From this first episode, it's clear exactly what took place here. You can save yourself 25mins by watching 2. Unfortunately I suffered through the entire episode just to give it a go and see if there was any point. There wasn't. There wasn't even a crime. Just a bunch of idiots looking for someone to blame, to funnel their own hate and ignorance, when it should have been directed to the people in the immediate vicinity.
How MTV could allow such drivel is beyond me.
Don't waste your precious time.",False
10,3,"Sorry, but this is a useless show!",tlroftruth,n/a,15/08/2025,"While I admire the drive & passion Mr. Pongo displays, his extremely one sided, inaccurate racist attitude overshadows his voice. The episode on the tragic murder of Darrien Hunt accomplished nothing, everything he ""investigated"" was already public knowledge. If he was an actual investigative journalist, he would know that filing an FOIA request for the videos both dashcam, from the bank, etc .. would've been step one. And it's a little disturbing how he is so open with his dislike for white people, and how he throws out totally false information. Statistically, white males experience a higher rate of violent encounters with law enforcement then African American men. Check your card before you throw it down and look foolish. I personally am tired of the poor me song and dance. This is an abuse of power and government corruption issue. Not everything is just about race!!!!!",False

1,7,It Sells,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this back at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival""Mija"" follows Doris Mu√±oz, who began a career in music talent management and met Jacks Haupt, an auspicious young singer, and both share the ever-present guilt of being the first American-born members of their undocumented families. Music documentaries aren't really big for me as they are pretty bland and basic for the most part. However Mija does a pretty good job on displaying music and Mexican culture with a very interesting character and Isabel Castro's approach on this subject. Doris Munoz is an interesting character to listen and watch as we are navigating though her life and what she is surrounded by. Munoz is quite interesting and that's what made the movie very enjoyable and engaging.The pacing at times could be improved and the editing choices can be better as well. But Isabel Castro did a good job with this. By the end of the day, I felt happy for Munoz after watching this musical journey she went through.Rating: B.",False

1,8,Awesome But Missed the Biggest defining Moment,neiltaylornz,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film really shows many aspects of Israel including his emotional self who really is a complex individual.There really is some great scenes that you don't see often with sporting greats. It's incredible that there was insight to see the filming to start in 2019 when Israel was not a champion.For me it missed one of Israel's and the world of sports most incredible moments when Israel knocked out Pereira in his first win in 4 fights. This moment shows so much of a coach and a fighter. The shear grit to come back for a forth match after 3 losses but the strategy that won that fight ""playing possum"" is one of high level sports most strategic well thought out moments.",False
2,10,"Wow, must watch !",melodie-ants,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary on Israel Adesanya's rise to being global star is a very raw and real account of the man he truly is.It shows the importance of surrounding yourself with people who will tell you how it really is. Israel is shown a ""mirror"" many times during this documentary. A lot of stars would shy away from that Mirror but Israel confronts it all face on. It shows him at some of his highest and lowest points and how he manages to get through. The relationship between coach and fighter is a beautiful thing to watch. I highly recommend this documentary very well done, nothing is off the table.",False

4,10,Well put together and interesting doc,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs someone iwht little interest in these kinds of sports, I am tending to look more at the filmmaking qualities, artistic merits and overall pacing and cutting of these kind of films - and this film indeed is truly a treat when it comes to that.It is indeed very sharply cut and edited, expertly paced and maintains and builds interest through its intermediate interview materials, artistically staged scenes and TV clips. Very expertly and cleverly done, and utterly engaging, to be sure.Overall, this well paced, cinematographied and overall interesting and engaging documentary, is definitely one I would recommend!",True
5,10,As real as it gets!,jonprice-94168,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a beautiful piece of art this is, breaking cycles, be yourself stop trying to fit in or worry about others opinions, stop letting the world tell u what being a man is and that u can't do this or like this and be a man. The ones that say that are just insecure within themselves! I'm so glad Izzy is unapologetically himself. It's so refreshing, the loudest one in the room is the most frightened most of the time, so cry, see a therapist, talk about your feelings, open up to the ones you care about, listen. Don't react, respond! These things are what make a man! This is bigger than a ufc fighter documentary. It's a true masterpiece.",False

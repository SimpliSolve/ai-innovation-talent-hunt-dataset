1,8,Painful and well done,aarpcats,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well, I see I am here on IMDB with all the other survivors of childhood abuse.This series captures (in a way I have personally never seen before) the way living with abuse places the child in the upside down world. Kids are told to talk to their parents when someone hurts them, but how does a kid talk to the parent who just beat him or her to bleeding? They don't. They just figure out how to survive until they can get away,Everyone failed this child until he met a lawyer who himself had been abused,He can't hurt you anymore, Anthony. Peace and love to you.",False
2,8,It is almost never black or white!,Guanche48,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very good documentary. Well edited and detailed, at the same time frustrating and sad.I couldn't stop watching it, very interesting.The stepmother, Susan, is a really strange and unbelievable woman, very lost, in my opinion. It's the most annoying part of the documentary,
this happened 3 years ago!!! If you know what I mean.The police, again, also very passive.Please learn from this and don't let it happen again! It could have been avoided in my opinion.In short, a great documentary to also learn that not everything is as simple as it seems.",False
3,8,A very thought provoking story.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"A look into the case of Anthony Tamplet, who shot his father dead, the question is why, he never denied it, but what pushed him to this breaking point?A very well made series as you'd expect, it's certainly different, it tells a very unusual story. Insightful interviews, first hand points of view, and some surprising footage.It makes you think outside of the box, it forces you to question whether killing someone can be justified, or if it's always wrong to take someone's life.The real twist comes at the end of Part one, and what you thought was reasonable, what you thought you knew, is turned on its head.For what it's worth, I liked Anthony, you can see someone who's had a terrible start in life, and anyone that says he's cold, I'd dispute that, and urge you to watch episode three closely, you'll see a different side to him.8/10.",False
4,7,This is what I'd like to see more on Netflix!,Erik_Surewaard,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great documentary! I personally think that Netflix is pretty good at making this kind of true crime documentaries. The great thing is that they not only use the publicly available materials like e.g. Interrogations, but also interview all relevant people: e.g. Police, family, friend, neigbours...So I certainly hope that we do not need to wait long before we get another one of these documentaries.",False
5,7,Good documentary,maytekinaliyeva,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we could see how a person can be broken. I hope he can meet the people who will fix him. My mom and dad showed me love at every age of my life. So I can easily show it to others. However, my husband is kind of cold and very bad at expressing his feelings because his family is so, too. After meeting me I turned him into a teddy bear)) I show and tell him how much I love him at any chance I get. He says that I changed him beyond recognition. Not showing your feelings doesn't make you a psychopath. People sometimes don't show feelings because they simply don't know how. He is going to change after he is surrounded by normal, loving people. We are what we see, and we become what we feel eventually.",False
6,7,Sad Story,noahharrigan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Another good true documentary story produced by Netflix. First off - it's nice how they shed light on how cumulative manipulation and abuse can have ruin on a persons life. I thought the production had all the pieces for a sad, but educational docuseries. Some of these documentaries are too long and dragged out - but this one tells you the whole story in three episodes.God bless Anthony and may he make the most of a full life that is ahead of him!",False
7,n/a,Truely touching,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"How can you not feel with him and his family? I love this documentary series. In between you thought, why isn't she fighting for her child? And then you learn more about how she did. And how other people got involved to do the same. I wish you all the best Anthony! Thank you for sharing and thanks to the documentarist for letting us know how cases like this evolve.",False
8,7,A good piece of work with some presentational flaws! [+65%],arungeorge13,n/a,15/08/2025,"Skye Borgman's latest documentary starts off with a very biased and disjointed perspective, but progressively gets better and ends on an emotionally high note. The first episode paints the titular incident as an open and shut case, with the first investigators never bothering to understand the years of trauma that led to it.When the story turns on its head, and the supposed perpetrator eventually becomes the victim, we arrive at a more informed point of view. Bigger stories of abuse come to light, and we begin to slowly understand why Anthony may have done what he did. The lawyer, while his intentions are good, came across as full of himself, and I think Netflix gave him a chance to look like a heroic saviour.That aside, to see ""hopeless, emotionless"" Anthony catching up with his biological mother's family and breaking into tears, was very moving. I'm glad that Netflix has started looking at true crime documentaries beyond serial killers.",False
9,7,This should be at the forefront of society,d_penn,n/a,15/08/2025,"It would be good to watch this with an open mind. I think the district attorney's interviews might mirror the way many laypeople would react to the situation and to Anthony's behavior, before, during and after he killed his father. So it's important to watch until the end to see how her opinions evolve as she is (and we are) exposed to more evidence, as well as expert opinions and the perspectives of Burt's victim-survivors. The ending....oof. Heartbreaking. This series is so real. If you don't like it, you don't like reality. So lets become activists to stop domestic abuse and start asking the right questions, as the advocate mentions in the third episode: not why didn't she leave, or why didn't she take Anthony with her, or do this or that, but how can this man be so abusive to the people he's supposed to love the most? What is it that made him feel entitled to so much power and control? Very educational and thought-proviking series. Also didn't feel too long or short.",False
10,9,Balled my eyes the last 15 min,bsant54,n/a,15/08/2025,"I did.Heartbreaking story of mental abuse and enforced isolation.I too was abused but at least allowed to go to school. At times I too wanted to kill my father for beating me and my mother, yelling and mentally abusing me as a child at all my inadequacies, so many, many times - too many to count or recount here. My outlet was school and some neighbor friends. I cannot imagine having had that taken away from me and what I would have done. Age 10 I begged my mother to take me away to somewhere else, I could not take it anymore. She never did.Anthony you could see at the very end was beginning to be himself, cope with freedom and integrate with society all of which he had been denied for his entire life. He was making the effort.I understand him well, I wish him all the best. He will do well I think. I did, and expect he will too. At the very end his sign of emotion said it all to me.Why I cried.Mirror. Mirror.",False
11,6,Don't judge a book by the cover....,Serenity3000,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIn the first 10 minutes of this mini-series/documentary, I thought just another rich and privileged brat getting away with murder. But as the series moved forward, I realized that Anthony had been mentally tormented by his evil and overbearing drunk abusive father for most of his life. This killing was totally justified. Burt was truly a POS with money and a good job that beat up both his wives. Such a terrible human being and his son has had enough. There is no justification for the abuse this young man went through. Some killings are just due and this was one of them. The series does a great job of highlighting all angles of the murder, with video evidence of some of the drama. Burt had all those videos around the house, actually helped Anthony's case. If I had been on a jury, it would have been hard for me to convict this young man. Sometimes mental abuse can be more destructive than physical abuse.",True
12,9,Wow. CPTSD misunderstood once again.,pnwgirl,n/a,15/08/2025,"I appreciate this documentary's attempt to explain cumulative childhood trauma and shed light on its effects. The testimony of the father's friends are completely consistent with what it would be like to be a scapegoat child. The abusive behavior is hidden from all but the child. Everybody is surprised to learn what is happening, that's the point. It's called coercive power and control and a child has no psychological defenses against it.Dissociating emotions in order to survive is a hallmark of childhood trauma symptomology, and every level of law enforcement and psychological help that deals with violence and victims, should be versed in what it looks like. It is one of the most misunderstood psychological concepts, including by most psychologists, as it is not taught even at the graduate level other than in the most cursory way.How to be trauma-informed is going to become ever increasingly important in this complex world of ours. It's time we start understanding when someone's affect is completely flat and they're unable to tell their own stories about their own lives, you're looking at something complex, and it just could be that it's a childhood trauma victim in front of you, and not a stone cold killer. The uninformed attitudes of some of these law enforcement professionals was highly upsetting to watch. Let's become more trauma-informed, shall we?",False
13,7,Get ready for some complicated emotions..,HorrorDonLeash,n/a,15/08/2025,"The story delves deep into the murder of a father at the hands of his own son. Most of us agree that if you do the crime, be ready to face the time. The doc explains why this is a difficult situation and there are many shades of gray here, as we start to undercover who this father really was and the reasoning behind this kid's actions. This doc does a good job by explaining what happened when the crime was committed but then gives us background and insight as to why this kid made this poor decision. It will really make you question whether you would have done the same if you were in this kid's shoes. I cried 3 times in the last episode. It's rare we get to see the criminal justice system work for someone in bad situation, and not against them. Would recommend.",False
14,2,Awful manipulative cash-in documentary,thekarmicnomad,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe film opens with a police report that a son has executed his father - this is fact.Several experts comment on the psychopathic behaviours shown by this troubled young man.Perhaps things are not as they seem.A bit of digging around and it seems the father may be abusive.We speak to the women surrounding the incident who focus with laser intensity on the son - leaving their lives opaque and blurry.The documentary-makers allow the women to tell some ambiguous, misleading and sometimes untrue statements that do not align with any kind of reality that we are shown.So perhaps they are not what they seem?Then we see the defence team who lament how the boy is doomed to go to prison and they will have to lobby hard to get any kind of justice for him as he clearly killed his father.Then, after two hours of dancing around, the documentary-makers decide it is time to mention all the testimonies and evidence showing that the father was a violent, abusive, control freak who no one would shed a tear over his loss.Oh, yeah and on the day of the incident the father had lost everything: his job, his family, his control and maybe even his sanity - making him a very dangerous man.Now that half the story is no longer obscured everyone agrees that the boy has clear mitigating circumstances and any sentence should be lenient.This is the worst kind of documentary, where smoke and mirrors are used to obscure facts and portray victims as perpetrators and then whip away the curtain with a flourish and pretend that expectations have been subverted.No, you just lied to us and we took that information in good faith.The only interesting part of this story was not investigated.In the USA is the policy when responding to allegations of child abuse just to send a beat officer around and ask the child on the drive way (in front of their alleged abuser) if they are ok?Despite the child barely existing in the system: no school records, medical records, dental records, nobody thought to even mention it to Social Services or follow up at all.Is this normal in the USA?I don't know as the documentary didn't seem interested in the slightest.",True
15,6,I Just Killed My Dad is a smart and surprisingly empathetic true-crime story.,punchsrv,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerJust when I was starting to think ""Another day, another Netflix true-crime docu-series about a dysfunctional American family,"" the sensationally titled I Just Killed My Dad surprised me. Not with the twists and turns of the real-world story itself - which, to nobody's surprise, is stranger and spookier than fiction. But with its tone. Here's a rare three-part investigative docu-series more concerned with human closure than narrative suspense; with difficult questions rather than easy answers; with the rehabilitation and restoration of identity rather than the restriction of spirit; and most of all, with the asterisks of the criminal justice system and societal perception. The gaze is almost hopeful, which is a weird thing to say about a documentary that opens with a teenager who shoots his dad dead.I Just Killed My Dad is about the case of Anthony Templet, a 17-year-old from Louisiana who called 911 in mid-2019 to confess that he had killed his father. Anthony himself appears before the camera in the beginning, admitting that he wants to clear his name and prove he isn't a crazy murderer. He speaks in a monotone; his eyes are curiously dead. It becomes clear that the documentary will set out to deconstruct our preconceived notions about sociopaths - Anthony Templet fits the profile, sure, but is that really enough? What follows is a 360-degree view of the incident that night, supplemented by his own recollections, officer statements, eerie reconstructions, detective angles as well as a thorough assortment of observers who seem to be torn between what they knew and what they later discovered. There are all the Netflix tropes, of course: the gory details, the red herrings, the cliffhanger endings, the shady characters, the perpetual zooming out from a story that is way broader than it appears.But the story refuses to be defined by the incident. The second and third episodes dare to read between the lines, revealing the agency embedded between innocence and guilt. It is steadily revealed that Anthony was no average privileged brat; he was the long-time victim of an abusive parent who stunted his growth in order to control him. The dead eyes and lack of facial expression are actually numbness, derived from years of suppression and a caged life. Anthony was homeschooled badly, not allowed to make friends, tracked electronically and ill-treated by a father who snatched him away from his mother as an infant. As we learn more about the checkered history of the man that Anthony killed, the true implications of Anthony's actions emerge.A lawyer enters the fray; a biological mother speaks out; a stepmother asks for subtext; a social system recalibrates its sense of punishment and justice. The documentary fully invests in each of these faces, too, as people and not passive players: signifying its willingness to engage with why Anthony's case is so unique, why they choose to believe in his innocence despite all the evidence against him. We begin to sympathize with the boy who was never allowed to evolve and know the difference between self-defense and violence. In hindsight, moments like Anthony casually describing his expectations after shooting his dad - that the man would survive, that Anthony would be rescued, that the cops would let him go after hearing his story - are heartbreaking, because they convey his limited understanding of civilization. He hasn't been taught how to be human, and yet, there's something shatteringly human about his situation.In many ways, I Just Killed My Dad reminded me of Girl in the Picture, a recent Netflix true-crime documentary about a teenage girl whose childhood was robbed by an abusive father. Girl in the Picture, too, eschewed the voyeuristic lens of the genre and painted an empathetic portrait of who the girl was, and how her life was worth being celebrated; it never offered undue attention to her abuser, and chose to end with an unusual brand of optimism and respect. The format is almost the same, with good samaritans and compassionate relatives fighting to restore the identity and legacy of the victim. It makes more sense once you realize that the director of both titles is the same: Skye Borgman. And it's even more poignant once you realize that thematically, I Just Killed My Dad is natural progression - and perhaps some sort of creative catharsis - for the non-fiction film-maker.Girl in the Picture opened with the murder of the girl, which means she never lived to see the decades-long investigation and redemption of image that followed. Her family and friends battle to remember her the right way, long after she's gone. Anthony, on the other hand, represents the opposite end of the spectrum: the film opens with him killing his abuser, but lives to see the light at the end of a dark tunnel. The two narratives are joined at the hip, with Anthony's legal fate revealing the film-maker's subconscious quest to locate an alternate ending - and a sequel-ish sense of dignity - to the typical American horror story.Even more striking is Anthony's physical transformation between 2019 and 2021 (when a decision about him is made), which not only reinforces his presence and survival but also puts into perspective his perceived lack of mental growth. He sounds self-aware and conscious by the end, a different person altogether, if not entirely emotive. He even walks awkwardly, like a young man who hasn't seen enough kids his age to know how to walk. But even this image of intellectual inertia is put to rest in the documentary's exquisitely placed final shot - one of a younger Anthony breaking down months after being released from prison. The timing of this shot suggests that the documentary deliberately holds a mirror to our flawed reading of the relationship between trauma and expression - playing along with it before dismantling it in style. He was not in the picture; the picture was in him all along, simply waiting to be seen.",True
16,7,Exposes the well known flaws in our Judicial system.,coachnewcoach,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary exposes the clear flaws in the judicial system. While yes this kids father was dck and yes he was taken from his mother, I wonder if he gets the slap on the wrist he received if he were black. Bottom line is he grabbed 2 guns, opened the door that his father was trying to forcibly enter but had failed to at that point, then proceeded to shoot his dad. His dad then turned and ran and he shot him again. He then begged for his life and he shot him a third time in the head. He could have jumped out the window, called the police, threatened to shoot him but not followed through, shot him once in a non lethal manner, any number of things. He intended to kill him and by the letter of the law that's 2nd degree murder.The problem I have is that the DA knew she'd win the case because by the letter of the law he committed murder or at minimum manslaughter. She then gave him a get out of jail free card. My question is would or will she do the same for little black boys that grew up in bad environments and whose fathers are bstards? 🤔The problem I have is that it just showcases that judges, prosecutors, and District Attorneys are likely to give lesser sentences and opportunities to people that look like them. The DA can see her son, brother, nephew, father, uncle, grandfather in this kid and as such essentially let him walk away scott free because she can empathize with him. The same way Brock Turner could commit rape and be convicted and the judge gave him 3 months because he ""didn't want to ruin his life"". He shot his father in cold blood, expressed NO remorse, NO empathy, NO emotions whatsoever, and the DA can look at someone like this and say that he was a threat to that person but not to society as a whole. She essentially bypassed the evidence and threw the case out because she didn't want to win at the expense of this kid going to prison for his actions. I don't mind that so long as her history before and after reflects that she does the same for kids of similar situations and backgrounds that don't share her completion. Good documentary though.",True
17,7,Powerful,suego-49293,n/a,15/08/2025,"This kid was let down by just about every adult in his life up until the killing. His one best ally was his step-mother, but even she let him down by letting the father override her desire to help Anthony. I honestly still don't know if he deserved to serve time or not, but I truly hope in the last few years he has sought professional psychiatric help. He desperately needs it after the childhood he was forced to endure at the hands of all the ineffectual adults in his life if he ever hopes to have any chance at a life of normalcy.",False
18,6,These adults are ALL TRASH,zack_gideon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wtf. How can so many adults be so trashy. Just all trash. No one will take responsibility, all just sitting there playing the victim. I mean come on now...you're a an adult not a child. His mother is the worst one. She's just a trash human. She won't take even one ounce of responsibility for how crappy she was as a parent. Gross. Humans suck sometimes. Bla.",False
19,7,Sad,gallagherkellie,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe only thing I didn't like about this documentary was his misleading it was in the first episode - but I guess it's their way of giving us 'twists'.I've recently seen a video where Anthony says he doesn't talk to anyone anymore from the documentary...he had a falling out with his step mum and became homeless for a bit. He hasn't been to see his mum again and he only speaks to his lawyer. I find that sad but I also think his counselling may have dredged up things that have made him realise these people aren't good for him, who knows? He seems a lot more chatty though and has come a long way!! He has a girlfriend!Domestic abuse and child abuse is so horrible because it's usually hard to prove. You don't need a black eye to be abused. He was basically locked up and controlled for his whole life, wasn't allowed to have friends or be social, didn't see doctors. So to the losers who are saying that's not abuse and he's a sociopath - I'd like to see what happens to your brain and personality if you were watched, locked away, not allowed to ever be around around children or people apart from family, kept from your real mother, had cameras on you, watched your real mother then stepmother be beat up constantly and more.",True
20,10,Proof evil and idiots are rampant,nicolerose-21557,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerIt's heartbreaking to watch what a child had to endure at the hand of his father. So many people failed him due to lack or money or knowledge. His stepmom confused me and I feel she should have done more for Anthony.I got really frustrated at the people who gave opinions but have no experience in abusive environments. Not killing his father probably would have eventually meant his own death. Justice would have been his dad to live and spend the rest of his life in jail. Death was too good for that man!We need to STOP blaming children for the adults choices. Netflix may seem bias to some but I don't think glorifying a horrible man because he's dead was needed.,True
21,6,Bizarre. Insane. Sad. Devoid Of All Family Values.,justingeeterr,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ok. My Headline Isn't Completely True, but when it comes to the Title of the show ""I Just Killed My Dad."" It's hard to find the Love, however it's still there. I do feel quite bad for some of those involved in this tragic story like Anthony Templet and his mother.With that being said, this Docuseries is middle of the road as far as Entertainment goes. I enjoy True Crime and I think that Netflix has a lot of good shows and features when it comes to this Genre, but they can't all be great.The way this one unfolds its story is a tad bit annoying. It kept losing me because of its nonlinear progression. I'm all for this structure, but it doesn't always work. Especially when you are spending time on things that don't really matter or were previously established. They then quickly brush past Facts or concerns that seem necessary to flesh out a bit more. I was actually yelling things out to my Television with this one. I wanted answers Damnit! It could've easily been trimmed here and there. Could it have been just 2 episodes instead of 3? You Betcha! Would it have worked as a feature length Documentary, possibly.All in all, it's still worth a watch because of its weird Twists and Turns, but there are better True Crime shows out there to sink your teeth in.",False
22,10,What a sad sad life,denise-882-139023,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary, managed to convey that ""quick to Judge"" syndrome. A sullen, emotionless youth; must be a monster.It successfully manages to turn things around. You too would be like that, if circumstances lead you to adopt that persona, if all your life you have to be like that to try to avoid triggering someone's, your captor's aggression.I was so, so sad for what that poor boy's life had been.I hope his future is bright.Anyone who has a problem with this documentary, for whatever reason, has a heart of stone.",False
23,7,Story worth to be told.,deloudelouvain,n/a,15/08/2025,"The story of Anthony Templet, who shot his father and never denied it, was worth to be told. The documentary is well made, not too long (only three episodes) as some true crime documentaries sometimes are. Good interviews from everybody involved, except from the father that obviously couldn't defend himself, but after watching the documentary we can conclude that he wasn't a good man. Again and again the documentary shows what a failing society America can be. How can a father abduct his kid and get away with it for so long? Home schooling without anybody asking questions shouldn't be allowed anymore as we're not living in the Middle Ages anymore. Worth a watch if you like true crime documentaries.",False

Never found? In 2007? The father didn't bother to change his name and during the age of the interweb and police cooperation was never found? Ever? In all that time? Ridic.The accusation that Anthony was unfeeling during his 911 call left us shaking our heads. No one considered he could have Aspergers? That was not even addressed.

It's heartbreaking how much this kid had to endure.I think this resonated more than other true crime docs because Anthony was also interviewed throughout it. He was the one who lived through most of it, and seeing his behavior change from robotic to human was a relief. But, from the start, he's a believable narrator and witness. Overall, a tough watch with a happy ending (for once).Really glad I got to see more of the family, as well as ""meet"" the lawyer involved. I'm so happy he got to reunite with his mom.",True

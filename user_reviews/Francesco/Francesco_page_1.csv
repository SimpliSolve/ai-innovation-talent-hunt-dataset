1,7,Wonderful and complex film showcasing one of the world's visionaries,rannynm,n/a,15/08/2025,"Francesco is a wonderful and complex film that showcases one of the world's most famous figures. The audience has a clear visual of Pope Francis's thoughts about modern issues. With exclusive interviews and audio recordings, this documentary is not to be missed.Francesco is a documentary composed of rare videos, interviews, tweets and audio tape recordings about Pope Francis and his ideas about contemporary problems. The issues addressed are refugee camps in Lesbos, migrants and he also talks about his ideas on homosexual marriage.There's so much to learn from this film. It really gives insight on how the Pope thinks and how he has changed ideas for the Catholic religion. Giving his opinion on homosexual marriage is a huge statement; he believes they are entitled to have a family like any other person. This shows how he has come to embrace everyone with open arms. Pope Francis stands out from popes before him, which is why this documentary is so important. He isn't just a figurehead; this film shows how relatable he is as well. He is well aware of his impact on the world, such as how he helped the Muslim refugees in Greece. The film shows that Pope Francis doesn't see religion, race or sexual orientation as barriers, he just sees people. I loved seeing so many never before seen videos and recordings in this film. We see the Pope in Lesbos helping out whoever he can, and see how a woman thanks him for his help.This film shows that not everyone is as they first appear to be. The media often portrays the Pope in a godly manner. In this film we see that he does not think that of himself. He seems to be like any other guy, just doing the work of God. There are no triggers for this film, but mature topics discussed include immigration, religion and homosexual marriage.I give Francesco 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages (13 to) 18 plus adults. It releases on DVD March 28, 2021. By Heather S., KIDS FIRST!",False
2,6,Francesco Review,theredsky,n/a,15/08/2025,"A very interesting and in-depth look at one of the most popular religious figures of all time. There is a lot here to digest and sometimes it feels like there is too much to digest. This is the film that reveals Pope Francis's stance on gay marriage and he says that he supports it which is amazing. It really was a great look into his life although it feels very disjointed. It doesn't really have a competent structure and instead prefers to present issues for a little bit and then talk about it later and not at that time which would be fine if it didn't do this all time. It also feels a little bit too long. This documentary is 2 hours but it really shouldn't be this long. Although it was long, the information presented and how it was presented was thought provoking and mostly unique. I'm glad I got the opportunity to watch this at the Savannah Film Festival. Whenever this film comes out, please go watch it. It's worth it.",False
3,1,What a joke....,KurosawaAkeeera,n/a,15/08/2025,"Francis tried to pretend he would be a different pope and while he talks a good game, he continues to enable the church to continue its most horrific and problematic behavior. Despite hinting at support of gay marriage, the church continues to condemn homosexuality as inherently unnatural. Francis also helped the church fight against a law that would allow abuse victims to sue the church. The church tried to use Francis to appear progressive, and he played along, to rehab some of the image of the church, but Francis is just another pedophile protector. Films like this just serve to whitewash his true legacy.",False
4,10,Good documentary,ruslantrad,n/a,15/08/2025,"I a very good documentary for pope Francis who is proved to be a role model for many. His example is important and the movie shows that. Unfortunately, the ratings here are not an honest review but pure hate and cynicism.",False
5,10,If youre not moved to weep watching- you must have lost your heart,tezzasmif,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film does not shy away from the abuse suffered by people by some in the clergy. For those with no knowledge on Francis it will provide a deep insight into the man, for those with prior interest in Pope Francis it will elucidate further the profoundly humanitarian character of this man. We see Pope Francis with the energy of a man half his age buzz about the globe caring for those on the peripheries. He fights and highlights uncomfortable realities that the world leaders & media would prefer we aren't aware exist. The outpouring of respect from people of differing faiths and none at this sad time of Pope Francis death will make so much sense after watching this film for anyone in doubt. While Francesco has been the leader of the Catholic Church globally for the last 12 years there is less reference to God in this film (which might please some) and more provides a portrait of how much Francis loved humanity and the world. The film is a heart opening experience.",False
6,10,Heartwarming,janewang-22983,n/a,15/08/2025,"Documents snippets, albeit important snippets, of Pope Francis' papacy. For anyone interested in Francis as a person and as a Pope, it's a great documentary to watch.",False

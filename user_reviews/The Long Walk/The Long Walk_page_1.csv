1,10,Soul stirring extra-ordinary documentary!,faizmomen-96701,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a must see documentary on human race and life! It makes us realize how intimately integrated we are with the nature surrounding us, how we deviated from nature over time, in the name of civilization, but at a supreme cost. Dialogues are exceptional, inspirational and educational as well. We once again meet with our original ancestors: San people, the people remarkably so simple but intelligent. Their dealings with the nature, their extensive knowledge on natural things, be it tree, animal or anything, truly mesmerizes the audience. A great documentary for all ages, and all races across the World.",False

1,9,Fantastic documentary about film and it's presentation,Nose_City,n/a,15/08/2025,"Excellent movie, I learned so much about film and projection from this in both historic and modern contexts. Particularly, all the different projection methods that are so often mentioned in rye opening credits of old movies.The story of the movie flows really well through a number of topics and the time flew by. An epic effort to put this film together over so many years (it shows with how much is covered in the film) and it's thanks to things like this and Tarantino's Hateful 8 that I got interested and informed about the world of analogue film projection.I really recommend this to anyone with even a casual interest in film, projection or cinema history. Thanks to the creators for making this film!",False
2,8,"Splice Here is a fascinating documentary about the recent evolution of cinema, from a projectionist view: analog film to digital.",Larry41OnEbay-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"You can tell this feature documentary was created by a team of movie lovers Douglas Trumbull (2001: a space odyssey), Leonard Maltin (essential book author and film historian), Quentin Tarantino (game changing write, director), Rob Murphy star and director of this film. I especially like all the information about CINERAMA and that amazing process using a three-eyed camera to capture a 55 by 146 degree view (the same as the back of the human eyeball) and utilizing seven separate channel magnetic full coat, full range stereo sound both in 1952 before CinemaScope, VistaVision, NaturalVision 3-D, and decades before IMAX.We get to go into the projection booths with people who, it seems, lived in them for most of their careers because they loved their jobs, films and wanted it done right. The were there when things went wrong and they fixed it... they were not busy elsewhere popping corn!Highly Recommended.",False
3,10,"When Movies Were Real Movies, Not Zeros and Ones",Robert-6744,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I was a youngster in the 1960s I reveled in the Saturday afternoon matinees at our local Hoyts Cinema in suburban Melbourne (Australia). As a nerdy eleven year old, seeing a Cinerama presentation in Melbourne's Plaza Theatre with multi-channel stereo blew my mind and significantly heightened my interest to see what made it happen.At 13 I was introduced to a 16mm projector at school by my maths teacher and shortly after, I plucked up the courage and asked to look at the projection room in my local cinema. That started a three year period involving three nights and a matinee each week where the very understanding projectionists put up with my nerdyness, recognised my serious interest and taught me all the fine points, subsequently encouraging me to sign up for a course to obtain a projection licence for 35mm and later, 70mm. I worked part time in various projection rooms around the country for years after that, in the end working voluntarily in my local council run theatre until the death of movies on film around 2015.That was indeed a sad day for me, although I continue my interest to this day in my own 4K Dolby Atmos Home Cinema. I'm sure I annoy family and friends incessantly with how utterly fussy I am, that everything has to be perfect.Yes, I still miss the sounds of sometimes rattly cinema projectors with carbon arc or zenon arc lamps. I found Rob's excellent feature length documentary by accident and then purchased his Blu-Ray. What really amused me was the cue marks (little round dots) that came up in the top right corner every 20 minutes in the documentary. They signified the end of a reel coming up. We real projectionists love that inclusion Rob.Yes, before platters the movies had to change over from one projector to the other every 20 minutes. Getting the changeovers correct was an art developed by every serious projectionist. If it was a 70mm print, the changeovers were done even more frequently. That was before the age of platters came along, where all the reels were spliced together. A a bit sad but we still strived to present the audience with a top notch show.Missing a changeover and presenting the audience with gobbledygook then a white screen was a mortal sin, never to be repeated.Projection rooms were a projectionist's second home. This documentary takes me back to a time in my life that I loved very dearly and miss. I'm disappointed that many modern movie cinemas' presentations are sub-standard. We real projectionists wouldn't have stood for that!Well done Rob and crew for such a brilliantly well made journey back into a lost art and doubly well done on your work to restore the Sun Theatre in Melbourne to one that regularly presents movies on actual film for theatre lovers to enjoy.I thoroughly recommend this two hour documentary to anyone with even the most vague interest in the lost art of movie film projectioning. You won't be disappointed.",False

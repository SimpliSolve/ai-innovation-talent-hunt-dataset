1,9,A Must See,cutie7,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ibelin is a deeply moving documentary that beautifully captures the unexpected ways people connect in the digital world. It tells the story of Mats Steen, a young Norwegian gamer who passed away at 25 from a degenerative muscular disease. His parents, who believed Mats lived a lonely and isolated life, were overwhelmed when they started receiving heartfelt messages from his online friends around the globe. Through these messages, the film reveals how gaming gave Mats a sense of belonging and deep friendships that defied the physical limitations of his condition.Watching Ibelin was an emotional experience; almost everyone in the theater, including us, was in tears. The film is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, as it shows how Mats' life, though marked by illness, was filled with meaningful connections. It challenges the idea that a fulfilling life must look a certain way and reminds us that friendship and love can flourish in the most unexpected places. This story has left a lasting impression on us and is hands down our favourite at MIFF this year.",False
2,8,"I'm not crying, you are.",midnightmosesuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mats Steen was a poor, unfortunate lad who was born with a disease that caused his muscles to slowly whither away. This led to a life lived mostly bound to a wheelchair until he faded away and died. A horrible and empty way to live and die.Or was it?As it turned out the young man, who was an avid participant in a game called World of Warcraft, had built an alternate, online life with friendships and even some romantic relationships. Through his alter-ego ""Ibelin"" Mats lived the life he always wanted and seemed to find ways to help others on his way. It wasn't until after his death that the depth and extent of how many people his digital life had positively affected came to light.I have a kind of parallel experience from my own youth in that during the 80's I was very into role playing games. We were the geeks and the other outsiders who kind of banded together over a game that offered a means of escape from the everyday world. We were misunderstood and vilified as losers or even satanists. So, in watching this film, I recognized the world and the negative mindset endured by those who love online games. The setting had changed but the negativity towards the game was the same. I understood.It was very life affirming to see how Mats's character ""Ibelin"" released him from his physical constraints and gave him the opportunity to live a life lived well. Maybe this shows a way forward for people with such extensive physical difficulties, a way to put them entirely into a virtual reality so they can live a happy life through virtual avatars? Or maybe that's just wishful sci-fi thinking. Either way, I wept at several points in the film, sometimes through sadness, sometimes through joy. I'm not the kind of guy who cries easily but this film pushes enough of the necessary emotional buttons to make even a stone gargoyle cry.I find I'm still not convinced about the wholesomeness of online gaming, a lot of very unpleasant things have happened in some quite high profile cases. But, if someone were to ask me if online games are a good thing, now I've seen this film, I'd have to say yes, the majority of the time.God bless Mats and Ibelin, sleep well.",False
3,9,"Heartfelt and moving story about gaming, friendship, and communities",peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWatched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.By far, my favorite documentary in the entire festival. Director Benjamin Ree does a great job on capturing the life of Mats Steen who passed away from degenerative muscular disease and how Steen's left an impact on the gaming community of World of Warcraft. Ree's approach on the atmosphere, emotions, and the conversations from the participants were thoughtful, interesting, and emotionally investing as each of the participants had very interesting discussions about friendship, communities, and an positive look in the gaming community. Many documentaries and movies have portrayed gaming communities in a biased and unfair perspective and Ree does a good job on showing an honest outlook on how the gaming community can create positive impacts without feeling biased.Throughout, the production, camerawork and the sound designs are wonderful. The documentary uses a very interesting style where it uses mix of real interviews of people and discussions told through World of Warcraft animation style which really blended well. As the two mixtures created an interesting documentary presentation that almost felt like you are involved with the characters and them feeling real. There are moments where the characters interacting inside of World of Warcraft that are still burned into my memory.My only small compliant of the movie is that I felt some of the musical choices were a little cheesy and at times not fitting on certain aspects. But as a whole, this was one emotional journey. It's astonishing to see Benjamin Ree creating such an emotional documentary that leaves you feeling happy and will reduce you to tears.You don't have to necessary be a gamer to like this documentary. Rather anyone who has experienced with loss, friendship, and communities can get something out from it. Loved it.",True
4,10,Heartwarming!,kristineahellem,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to be at a screening where Mats' father presented the film, and afterwards he and the audience reflected around it. A mother in the audience said that the film gave her more understanding about her son's relationship with gaming, and they reflected on the fact that adults often judge the gaming culture before they have seen the whole picture. I think that was an interesting reflection.This film was so beautiful and heartwarming. The movie addresses many issues surrounding gaming, and tackles a number of prejudices many have against gaming and shines a new light on it. It opened my eyes to the freedoms it gives to many, and the fact that so many strong and lasting communities and friendships gets made and exist on this platforms. It also focuses on making the most of the life you have, and the power that lies in caring, being kind, showing respect and listening to others. Would recommend it heartily!",False
5,10,"I cried all the way, tears of sadness and tears of joy",pierreolivier-21287,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI didn't know Ibelin and I haven't been through what he has been through, but I have known World of Warcraft and other MMO, and I have known what he found there.This movie spoke to me and the me from years ago.Like others in need to escape reality, I found refuge into the digital world, role playing on forums, departing on a quest in my favorites MMORPGs.I made friends there, had my crush, and hurt when some of them disappeared, but I always came back to escape reality.This film, in it's authenticity touched me at my very core like no other movies have done before. It felt personal. The reconstruction of his life through amazing animation takes you where we all were decades ago. Playing with some weird looking characters on a server. It brought nostalgia, memories, good and bad. Ibelin is a symbol. He incarnates all of those who suffered, but still found solace in the online world.Thank you Mats for sharing your story, wherever you are. I send strength to your family and those who knew you offline and online.",True
6,10,MUST WATCH OF THE YEAR,saimariejohnson,n/a,16/08/2025,"This made me ugly cry and yet feel so inspired .As a carrier of Duchenne and a mother of two sons who have this horrible disease and also as a creative who got my start in role-playing communities.It is an ABSOLUTE Must Watch!The Story Behind Netflix's Moving Documentary 'The Remarkable Life of Ibelin. The film focuses on a Norwegian gamer who died at 25, leaving behind a richer online life than his family could have imagined.THIS SHOW is a MUST watch, I am seriously asking everyone to take the time out of their day to view. It is about Mats ""Ibelin"" Steen who had Duchenne and was an avid WOW player.For so many layers and reasons it is a documentary that hit every single one of my heartstrings.The Remarkable Life of Ibelin is on Netflix now.",False
7,10,By far the most emotionally evoking and relatable documentary I've ever seen.,xsdkyvhxb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is absolutely one of the most heart-wrenching documentaries that I've ever seen that really shines true to my personal experiences and connections that I've made and playing World of Warcraft. Good friend of mine, Sightblinder, passed away after knowing him for nearly 10 years playing World of Warcraft, but his impact lives true within me.True connection takes place only with genuine intention and complete compassion and empathy for those who you are connecting with... and in the world is distracting as what we have today, we don't find many like Ibelin.I think we all hope one day to have the impact that Ibelin did, and forever may he RIP.RIP Ibelin, AKA Mats.RIP Sightblinder aka Dan Borges.",False
8,n/a,Ibelin Continues to change lives,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is probably the most unprofessional but honest review I have given on IMDB. This was a beautiful story amazingly animated and curated to understand his nature and impact in how the digital age can still grip and touch us all. As someone who has constant Existential fears and worries around death. The story of Ibelin reminded me of the purpose we all share in this life, is our relationship with each other, how love and respect helps eachother to grow, and that if we open our hearts and allow each other to embrace both our gifts and our flaws, we can share something special regardless of the canvas our senses create.",False
9,7,Video games can reimagine a predestined life,spencermcook,n/a,16/08/2025,"My little brother and I shared vulnerabilities with each other about the endless passions that we both had. During those conversations Michael would share frustrations about people belittling him, talking slow to him, and ultimately treating him different than they would anyone else. My brother died at 20 years old due to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Watching Mats Steen's story told through home videos, documented conversations, and his blog titled ""Musings of Life"" was a near parallel to Michael's story through someone else's eyes. Not only is this powerful story a revealing depiction of those struggling with muscular dystrophy, but also a spotlight on how the gaming community can serve as a social anchor for those who need it most. World of Warcraft is used as a visual aid to portray the strength of digital relationships as well as showcasing the confidence that Mats develops with a secondary source of opportunities. Whether we decide to act on the possibilities in front of us or not, ""Ibelin"" is a reminder that people accept us and root for us even when we find it hard to do so ourselves.",False
10,10,Great expectations,olivergardinerturtill,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well, Rarely do i find a documentary that shreds me to the core.It's great in it's simplicity, but this true story hits you to the core on an international level. A must see for every parent and educator who is afraid of the online gaming community.Now, I rarely get emotional these days, it has been a few years since I have tears run down my face during such a long time. The documentary hits every chord it touches, for me at least. True, when you look at the story objectively, and take all the emotional items out of it, it is a story so cliché that it borders on the sickening delights of a cheap RomCom. It follows exactly the same story line one could imagine in a movie of that kind. Yet the true story and the testimonies of his family and the online community give it a message that hits home hard.Personally I was touched as my life has many similarities to our hero, but for quite different reasons and for sure I am not a hero, Mats is! In every single definition of the word.May there be many Ibelin's in this world, and the online worlds, and I hope 'World of Warcraft' erects a statue in Azeroth (or names the 30 minute route he ran every day) to the exceptional person that was Mats ""Ibelin"" Steen, and may they produce a full scale movie about his and his characters life with all profits going to the research of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",False
11,7,The significance of gaming,fredrikgunerius,n/a,16/08/2025,"The extraordinary story of Mats ""Ibelin"" Steen, a Norwegian man born with the rare genetic disorder Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), who found his most meaningful in-group as the character Ibelin in the online game World of Warcraft, is equal parts inspiring and sad. Directed by Benjamin Ree, the film combines classic documentary elements, such as retrospectives by poignant talking heads, with an inventive (and highly embellished) animated recreation of Ibelin's in-game antics. The end result is an effective, level-headed documentary that emphasises the significance gaming can have - for anyone, really - but particularly for people who face any sort of challenges in real life.",False
12,9,RIP Ibelin,MarvinLeroy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went to the cinema yesterday without knowing too much about the story, except it being very emotionally moving, and left it a feeling of gratefuleness.This movie displays the story of a young man who had to live his life with a severe muscular disease, that eventually took him. Due to his incapability of taking part in life in the real world, he chose to spent it mostly digitally in World of Warcraft. In this virtual world he was not limited by his disease and could do things, that he was not able to do otherwise.This documentary displays is life in WoW and how he affected others. It is a very moving story and I could imagine it to be eye opening, especially for elder people, who might not have a perception of how much a virtual world can impact people.I consider myself a gamer as well, not particularly a roleplayer, but a gamer and thereby I know, how beautiful games can be and how they can yield relationships. With that perspective in mind, I also was moved by the story. Rest in Peace Ibelin.",False
13,7,redemption for video games and parents,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. As parents we fool ourselves into believing we know our children and what they are up to. After all, they live in the same house and eat the same meals. Norwegian documentarian Benjamin Ree shows us quite a contrast to this theory. What happens when a loving family discovers their son's secret life much too late?Trude and her husband Robert were thrilled when their son Mats was born in 1989. Shock and disappointment hit hard when Mats was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a rare degenerative muscle disease for which there is no cure. Trude describes the pain of watching her son grow weaker. He had little appetite, became wheelchair bound, and made no real friends. As he got older, the parents refused to limit his computer time, as it was the only thing Mats seemed to want to do.At age 18, Mats started a blog. By age 25 he was dead. His final blog entry was ""Musings of Life"". Since the parents had Mats' password, Robert posted ""The Journey has Come to an End."" The family, including Mats' sister Mia, assumed that was the end of it. What followed was a true blessing (and shock) for the family. Tributes and remembrances of Mats streamed in from the online community. It turns out, Mats was a vital and active member of the Starlight group within the World of Warcraft gaming field. Mats had created a new persona known as Ibelin, and he lived an online life that was impossible for him in the real world.Some of these Starlight folks held a memorial for Mats, which meant so much to the family. We hear directly from some of the folks Mats had helped along the way. He was described as intuitive at helping other lost souls. His dad calculated that Mats had spent approximately 20,000 hours online over the last ten years of his life, and the family was elated that Mats had not led the life of isolation they assumed, and instead thrived behind the Ibelin avatar. This revelation was a true blessing, and it's told beautifully in this documentary.On Netflix beginning October 25, 2024.",False
14,10,A strong movie about a brave boy and the gaming community,jeanette_fjeldheim,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie should be mandatory for everyone to watch. Period. Especially parents who have children who spend a lot of time gaming. I thought I knew the story that I first read in a newspaper a number of years ago. But no, you think you know the story - until you see the movie. What a wonderful person Mats Steen was! Too bad he was so strict with himself when he was so generous with others.This is the first time I've experienced such a quiet movie theater. Everybody was quiet and remained seated when the credits rolled across the screen at the end. No one even put on their jacket. Now I know what to do if, due to age (or other things), feel isolated from the the real world. Then I think I'm going to be a gamer in The World of Warcraft.",False
15,10,A heartbreaking story on the power of digital communities,bitnoir,n/a,16/08/2025,"The most moving thing I've seen lately. Those who somehow, at some point in their lives connected with this game and experienced the community and solidarity looking for a window into another world, away from the craziness of everyday life can understand why since the release of the documentary they have flocked from across the game territory to pay respect to the digital grave of the unfortunate child. We met people, friends from all over Europe who we still play together and exchange gifts, some started relationships, got married and had children, some disappeared and rarely reappear and where as the game changed, it became more toxic, it finally entered the logic ""to satisfy the shareholders"" as happens sooner or later with all ventures of similar size. But this story takes us back to the first communities in the most heartbreaking way that could be told. Unbearable.",False
16,10,So Sad But So Inspiring,PalmBeachG,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know how anyone could give anything but a 10 rating for this emotional and heartfelt documentary that will leave you in tears. Whether you have experienced the world of online gaming or virtual worlds yourself, it is a must watch. Evidentially it is the 10 year anniversary of this young man's death since he passed away in 2014, and here he is still making a difference in people's lives as his story lives on through Netflix. He has reached the North, East, South and West globally and made a difference in people's lives through his online avatar and persona, his blog, his friend's stories and his family of course.",False
17,10,An amazing documentary about an amazing man,lizziee-75486,n/a,16/08/2025,"This really is a beautifully told documentary about someone who is remarkable. It's clear that Ibelin was a really kind and selfless person and that's clearly demonstrated throughout his online community. The impact he has made on others is truly inspiring.The documentary delves into his personal struggles, not only with how he was doing physically and the deterioration caused from his illness, but also how it affected him mentally which affected his online presence. I'm glad he shared his blog to others and saw how others appreciated him after this.The stories from the people he has helped was really heartwarming and shows how lovely he is as a person and as a friend.The ending really did make me tear up! It felt like I had known and experienced him myself, so the ending really made me upset, as if I was seeing my own friend leave.Not only does the documentary capture Ibelin's wonderful presence and depict his amazing impact on others, it also shows how important these games can be. In situations where somebody is unable to or has difficulty doing certain things, either through physical or mental illness, it provides a platform to be able to do these things. To love, to build real friendships, to have a community, to make a difference in the life of others is so important for the heart and mind. As well as being a place for having fun and gaming, it enables people to be whoever they want to be.This documentary really does have everything; awareness of his condition, the impact it had on his life, the impact he had on so many other people, the battle of not wanting people to treat you differently, and the importance open-world games can have on people's lives.I smiled, I laughed, I cried. 10/10 documentary.",False

This is a story about a young man who had life cruelly thrown at him. But he was blessed with a loving and caring family.Through all of his sufferings, he managed to become the man he wanted to be, and the man he was. A support and loyal friend, an advisor and companion.The virtual world of onliie gaming was his portal to freedom. I have played a bit myself, but was not aware there are groups where the strongest of friendships are forged. It was amazing how the movie managed to find some of his friends.

It is however a line you can't truly understand until you reach the end of the film. Ibelin may be the best documentary that I have ever seen and I hope you take the time out to watch it as well.Even folks who may have never played a computer game will come away with a real appreciation of how fortunate they are in their life. More importantly this film shows just how enduring the human spirit can be.Ibelin is a film that doesn't only ask question. Ibelin also provides answers!",False
21,10,I cried D like a baby-and I very rarely cry at,rahellehar,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cried D like a baby-and I very rarely cry at documentaries or movies. This film tells an incredibly beautiful yet deeply heartbreaking story. The journey portrayed is one of resilience, connection, and the universal desire to live fully, even against all odds. My brother has a similar illness, so watching this hit close to home, but I think this documentary speaks to something within all of us. The rawness and honesty of the storytelling create a space where viewers can feel deeply connected to the experience, regardless of whether they're gamers or not. I myself am not a gamer, but this documentary made me want to dive into that world, to understand what it's like, to feel what the main character feels, and maybe even experience that sense of freedom and connection. It's a rare film that can evoke such a range of emotions, from joy to sorrow to inspiration. Highly recommend watching this-it's a story that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",False

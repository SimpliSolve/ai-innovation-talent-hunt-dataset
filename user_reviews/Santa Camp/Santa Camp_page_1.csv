1,10,There's a new Santa in town!,rebeckaflygare,n/a,15/08/2025,"The importance of this movie and this community can not be stated enough. I was truly touched by the bravery in these people, and the impact they have on others.I was also disgusted by phobic and racist people claiming to be sent by God, and that the Holy Spirit spoke through them and chanting that they were saving Santa. News flash guys- Santa isn't even in the Bible and Christmas is not about hatred.I want to say so much more about this amazing documentary and the amazing people it evolves around, but that would spoil too much, so please watch it and experience the true Christmas spirit.",False
2,10,Wow. SO Good!,mikemckiernan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow, this surprised the hell out of me. One of my favorite modern Christmas movies is a documentary titled, ""Becoming Santa,"" which follows one man who decides to go to Santa training school and be a ""mall Santa"" for the first time (except he goes to just about everywhere except a mall). This one is sort of like a modern sequel, focusing on the lack of diversity with mall Santas and how the Old School Santas feel about it (some are open and some are not). It's a tear-jerker if you can empathize with what some of these newbies have to put up with. Too many people in our country want to live and die in the past, it's pretty pathetic. In the end, the message is a positive one and I highly recommend it for everyone who loves Christmas and has an open mind (and I also recommend it to those who don't, actually).",False
3,10,A Magical Exploration of Being a Better Santa,ereiss-28037,n/a,15/08/2025,"I highly recommend this documentary. It's an easy to watch heartfelt tale of Santa's working towards becoming better Santa's by helping a new generation of Santa's and imparting their ever growing book of Christmas cheer.Although not every Santa has learned how to cope with their white haired, white beard, white faced image of Santa, this rag tag band of Christmas misfits seeks out new diverse members to join ""The Brothers in Red.""While this documentary often times felt too literal and somewhat forced in its exploration of current social themes, it managed to bring it together in the end and the result is a beautiful exploration of what it means to be Santa in todays society.",False
4,10,Santas for All.,heykirala,n/a,15/08/2025,"A good balance of the unsettling awfulness of bigotry, and the magical excitement of what Santa truly represents. The the smiles of children and adults is a sturdy backdrop that makes small the hate and apprehension shown to these brave Santas, and by one bad santa.It really is a love triumphs over hate movie, that has a light touch where it needs to and does not skimp on all things festive. I was impressed with how honestly the movie showed how people learn to accept, exercise that acceptance to make it stronger, and how even if things make you feel uncomfortable at first, you realize it is simply because it is something you are not used to.Trans Santa meeting non binary kids brought tears. These children feeling free and open with their Santa broke a tension in me that I didn't know I needed breaking.Kid friendly (though it might lose their interest) and very intriguing to adults.A soulful and hopeful doc. Happy holidays to all and to all a good watch!",False
5,10,It's a Must-watch for aspiring Santas,mikeminney,n/a,15/08/2025,"Informative, inspiring and heartwarming. This documentary follows several Santa want-to-bes through their journey. It explores all the reasons why someone would want to become the most loved person in modern holiday history. It shows that everyone has some Santa Claus inside of them, and that's what the world needs.",False

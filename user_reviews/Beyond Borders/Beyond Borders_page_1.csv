1,5,So Sorry For the Pilot,goody-42341,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYet another dash , time critical mocudrama. If the whole point was to show how we are all one on the planet how come every flight was a dash and the actual people and places became secondary.
I felt so sorry for the pilot guy, why on earth did he saddle himself with the lazy, self centred drone of a person in Louis as his only companion.
What a complete waste of weight he was , offering nothing constructive for the trip other than becoming king of the look at me generation in this documentary.
There is no wonder that the pilot was peed off with him and refused to talk after a while. Personally I would have left him behind long before the end. The endless shots of him looking at himself in cameras, phones whilst endlessly boring everyone trying to show much he cared was seriously nauseous.Shame the young pilot deserved better, much better. And so did we",True
2,5,Meh - it was ok - but what was the back story with the producer?,michaeldecker,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was ok, and I'm glad I sat through it; a nice little travelogue from the cramped seats of a tiny private aircraft circumnavigating the globe. But I think I would have thrown Lois out of the plane several times, as his 'be cool, man' attitude got tiresome very quickly along with his obvious failure to deal with an unseen woman producer said to be 'putting the whole trip in danger' with unrealistic demands on the pilot.
So I couldn't wait for the end, when surely the woman would be confronted by the very sensible and long-suffering pilot. But not only did she appear to be missing, there was no explanation - and the end credits listed only a male producer.
I rushed over here to check the trivia section - nothing. So were we conned by a fake 'conflict' narrative, or was she fired and replaced? If you weren't going to tell us at the end, then you should have edited out all the references to the producer's conduct.",False
3,1,waste of space and time,allnighter_andme,n/a,16/08/2025,All the other reviews are right......it would have been better to show more of the landscape and thunder clouds than Louis....,False
4,9,Incredible to watch,carolienlennips-17350,n/a,16/08/2025,"If your known with the content of 'fun for louis', your gonna love watching this.They don't only show the people they met but also show the whole travel. And everything that goes with it.The struggles and problems they show makes it more real, and not staged at all. You see the real humanity side of traveling around the world.It's incredible to see the effort it takes to complete it. And the cultures they visited.I had followed the journey on YouTube during that trip. And this docu added the content I missed in the vlogs.Well done. It's amazing how it all came together.Just going with no expectations, then it definitely won't disappoint.(I read these reviews first, so I wasn't expecting it to be good, but I loved it. Build your own opinion, don't follow others because they might see things differently)",False
5,2,This won't save anyone - and surely not the planet!,gigerchristoph,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a bit disturbed how flying around the world in a private plane in very little time will help anyone on this planet to live more friendly which each other! Also it is pure sarcasm to talk about climate-change when a big part of the movie is about: How can I put more fuel into my plane?!"" People should stay more critical and use their brains! I guess they'll see how much of a joke this whole story is!",False
6,1,The worst movie I've ever seen,jon-40031,n/a,16/08/2025,This move sucks. There's absolutely nothing redeeming about it.I feel sorry for the people who spent money on the kickstarter.Don't waste your time.,False
7,1,Don't waste your time,sqyvkbtwn,n/a,16/08/2025,"A ""documentary"" that's supposed to focus on bringing the world together, and highlight the beauty in different cultures instead spent most of the ""film"" focusing on the drama between Louis and JP... I expected way more from Louis after it took years and years to complete this. Truly left disappointed and sad for all the folks that generously donated to his kickstarter only to be conned with a 90 minute self-serving vlog.",False
8,2,YouTube Vlogs,wst213,n/a,16/08/2025,I followed his world flight episodes on YouTube and was excited to watch this. The YouTube episodes... 100 times better. JP was the MVP of this documentary tbh.,False

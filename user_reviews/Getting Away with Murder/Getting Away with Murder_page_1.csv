1,9,Thank you,doydoy-75472,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dear Mr Wilkinson,This is the most important document on the holocaust in recent years that I am aware of, and I try to keep up on the trickle that is left.It is too easy to feel that we have seen what there is to be seen, felt what there is to be felt, and learned what there is to be learned about what is less than a generation away from being a breathless memory.So I am very grateful for those who know remembering is a discipline akin to work. And have what is needed to maintain a steady gaze at the past, or even the gumption to unearth parts of it we have yet to look at.A very well made and honestly intended film about how causes linger after their effects, and the vigilance we must keep.",False
2,9,extremely...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Important, but ever sooo... dont misunderstand a simple grumpy old man... a very dry and tummy wringing longlasting and painful turtlerace of pace ,even for a documentary,the way its presented its only baiting in the most highly intellectuals thats due to age or other circumstances has been in touch with the nazi/genocide matters, and leaves the rest of the audience in a big monstrous yawn by the slit in the wall, a slit so narrow that they have to climb on top of eachother to even get a glimpse of understanding the historical facts of gruesomeness that took place at the european civilian war theater, where actually way, way way more than 6 mill were murdered and sent into oblivion due to mad mens wrung minds in german dungeons and ''liberation'' camps, not only jews, but handicapped, gypsies, gay people, military prisoners, political activists, even humanists mentioned as the tip of the iceberg.Its a document of the past that wont fetch the masses due to the young generations historical disinterest made invalid by the in situ cravings of social media and other digital platforms of joy like war gaming and shootouts when grand theft auto...human memory is short and genocides has happened in vast numbers after ww2, like the balkans in the 90's, the rwanda in 1994 and the red khmer of cambodia in the 70's, not to forget stalins gruesome machinery, and the ever so cloaked businesses of chairman maos china... it will happen again, and it might happen to you too, so wether or not its long and yawndrawn, do raise these issues among your next of kins and kids, it shows the cruel and also the extremely weak and cowardish among thehumankind.....",False
3,10,Essential Viewing,tom-abell,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had always presumed once Joseph Mengele escaped to Argentina that he remained in South America until his death. Not so. The truth about were he went and when and who he visited is truly disturbing. GETTING AWAY WITH MURDERS lays bare many uncomfortable truths - perhaps too many for some, especially those who try to deny that the holocaust ever happened.Good documentaries tell stories, the best ones are films that the viewer learns from. And there is a lot to take in here. Emotion is overwhelming; anger and shame against compassion and sorrow.This film really should form part of the school curriculum in the UK and beyond. Everything revealed within it could all so easily happen again, especially now in our post-truth age.GETTING AWAY WITH MURDERS is essential viewing.",False
4,10,Must-see,solofilms-1,n/a,16/08/2025,An important film on so many levels and hugely relevant in our current global and domestic political landscape. Be warned this is a long film and it is a difficult watch at times but this is history that should be common knowledge and should never be forgotten.,False
5,10,The most powerful and haunting film. Essential viewing.,karrenwinchester,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought I knew all about the Holocaust. I was wrong. I left the cinema with tears of rage and sadness. Three hours flew by with an increasing build as interviews and scenes from the time and the present day added layer upon layer of evidence, fact and pain. A beautifully shot and compelling film which will stay with me.",False
6,10,A warning from history.,lesgrice,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had known for a couple of years that Mr. Wilkinson was in the throes of trying to get this documentary made, though the original conception I believe was eighteen years old altogether. I had done some 'magpie' research regarding The Holocaust myself and had questioned the how and why's of how a whole nation seemingly had turned into a huge killing machine and similarly the virus of Nazism had been transmitted across Europe, so much so that thousands of others had been either been recruited or volunteered themselves for the most terrible of crimes against humanity. The 'mystery' of the how's and whys are revealed here in this most extensive and painful documentary. It makes for difficult viewing and lays out as clearly as it can the whole gamut of what happened and the reasons why millions of innocent Jews and others were eliminated and how only 1 percent of those responsible were ever put on trial. You will have to watch it for yourselves to untangle the whole terrible web of horror and the equally terrible injustice not given to the Jewish people after the war. One thing you can take away from it is the warning that we have so often been given. How ordinary men (for these were not monsters) turned their back on their fellow man, murdered innocent men women and children for a toxic belief in the hateful dogma of the other being inferior and different to you and amounting to no more than the life of a beetle you would crush beneath your feet and that these same people could then return back to civilian life and allowed to live out their lives, a luxury not afforded to their victims.",False
7,10,"Riveting, revealing, disturbing, and a landmark documentary.",nickemm-49541,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to see this documentary at Broadway cinema in Nottingham during its opening UK tour. I knew it was going to be a long film, followed by a Q&A with the Director, and Malka Levine, who is a survivor of the Holocaust, and also appears in the film. I can honestly say that I've never experienced a documentary like it before, unparalled for it its depth and intensity. From beginning to end it asks important questions and highlights layers of injustice on injustices that have never been highlighted before in the myriad of Holocaust documentaries that have been produced since the end of World War II. Like all films on this subject, it is at times harrowing and disturbing, but this is a documentary that had to be made, and deserves to be watched. It is without question an important piece of cinematic work.",False
8,10,Relevant to Today,jenny_price,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although this documentary rigorously explored the lack of justice for the millions of victims of the Nazis in minute detail, it finished with a warning about mass murderers today being emboldened by a similar refusal to dispense full retribution today, mentioning the most recent offenders of modern times. This list ends with RUSSIA. Considering the genocide taking place in Ukraine as I write, this film could not be more pertinent to right now.",False
9,10,"One of 2021's Most Outstanding Films, let alone Documentaries.",kemalakhtar,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Getting Away with Murder(s)"" : Is a phenomenal breakthrough documentary In that it starts playing with form, length and approach. I can not recommend David Nicholas Wilkinson's documentary highly enough. The film is about how 99% of Nazi genocide planners walked away, scot free, after WWII. It is not only moving, harrowing and instinctively powerful, it is a timely reminder of modern secret histories, and how governments rewriting the past allows atrocities to continue in to the future. It is David's most critically acclaimed work after decades of independent integrity within our film industry and is making Critic's several best films list for 2021. As a documentary maker myself I say it sets a new high bar for British documentaries.",False
10,10,OUTSTANDINGAND SUPERLATIVE,elb-17964,n/a,16/08/2025,"'Getting Away With Murder'...remarkable and revelatory, a brilliantly unique, in depth and illuminating journey into the heart of darkness that was the Third Reich. For the first time, a truly detailed and fascinating account of the perpetrators of the Holocaust, chronicling the other 'survivors' who shepherded a nation's descent into a nightmare of unparalleled proportions, one of the darkest events in the history of mankind. A ground breaking tour de force, the film is an unprecedented examination of those among the nearly one million people behind one of the greatest crimes against humanity ever...those who literally, 'got away with murder'.",False
11,10,Masterful storytelling with new information on a familiar subject,brad-heath,n/a,16/08/2025,"Getting Away With Murder(s) is a worthy piece of storytelling settling into its rightful place in the historical record of WWII and the Holocaust. David Wilkinson and his team present a masterful look into the most tragic of subjects. It's rare to find a work that introduces new material on a topic so explored and measured. The film exposes the eye-opening and disturbing complacency of governments and its elected officials around the world, while tracking the trials of war criminals who were brought to justice and some who never knew the inside of a courtroom. Getting Away With Murder(s) is a superlative work. Once again. Wilkinson inspires with his storytelling, the editing is simple superb and the cinematography is top notch. Bravo!",False

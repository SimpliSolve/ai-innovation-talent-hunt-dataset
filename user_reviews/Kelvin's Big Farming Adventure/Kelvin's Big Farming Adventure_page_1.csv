1,7,A beginner's guide to farming,neillgudgin,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is not farming and these are not farmers. But it is interesting to see them dabble in various different livestock keeping. At most at the moment they are enjoying a funded hobby, but all the same it's plesant watching while we eat dinner. I do wonder how well paid the actors in Emmerdale are though, there seems to be a golden goose somewhere on this farm..",False
2,8,Worth a watch,gazza-allan-jones,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't understand the low ratings for this show. I found it really interesting to get an insight into farming life from some complete novices who had to learn as they go.If you enjoy other farming shows, then I think this show is well worth a watch.",False
3,9,Loved It!,wendycos,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerMixture of the rough and the smooth. Seeing Kelvin's eyes being opened to the sheer number of jobs and hard work needed through to Liz falling in love with life in the countryside = excellent viewing. Starting as hobby farmers but wanting to turn a profit. Really hope there will be another series following this likeable family through the winter and their efforts in making the farm profitable.,True
4,1,Lightweight Copy of Clarkson's Farm,johnsw,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dear God. Just as you thought that the BBC couldn't get any worse, here is old Auntie knocking another nail into her own coffin.The style of this mocumentary is similar to Come Dine With Me, with a voice-over throughout, for no particular reason, and we see a cast of townies who claim they want to live in the country and do some farming, and are obviously hating every moment of it.Clarkson's Farm is over 1,000 acres in size, and this BBC copy is a little more than 100 acres. That just about sums it up. It's a cheap pound shop copy and about one thing tenth as good.The only thing the BBC should be copying from Amazon is the way they are funded - by voluntary subscription.",False
5,1,Absolute waste of space,petesmit,n/a,15/08/2025,A total waste of time and licence payers money. Sure they're lovely people but farming is a way of life not something to dabble in for entertainment purposes..,False

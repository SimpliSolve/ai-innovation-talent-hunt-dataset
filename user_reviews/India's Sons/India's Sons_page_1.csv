1,10,"To the point, factual, eye opening",mohitsingh-74661,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows the poor state of women protection laws in our nation. The laws made for protection are being used as weapons by some women. Gender neutral laws we need.India's Sons is a compelling documentary that tackles the sensitive issue of gender discrimination and the misuse of laws designed to protect women.By highlighting the struggles faced by men within the legal system, the film calls for a reevaluation of existing legislation and the urgent need for gender-neutral laws. It invites viewers to engage in a broader dialogue on gender equality, challenging societal biases and advocating for a legal framework that ensures justice for all.",False
2,10,The other side of the coin,bijaysingha-86439,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am really thrilled after watching this. This is something you can't even think or know for a better choice in the society. This movie really brings you out from the the world of beliefs and keep you to the solid surface of truth.Every frame and bit of words are really touching you. This is the point of difference between what you know vs what is reality. I must say
""Yeh documentry rukati hai aur apko jhanjhorti hai. ""The unsung and unheard story of men which is always neglected by the society. The misuse of women centric laws has become a bloody murderous way for men genocide. This also shows mirror to our judiciary system and slaps the orthodox thinking system of the society which is called patriarchy but always worshipped the feminine gender. The power and authority give to the woman has always been misused since Surpanakhas and holikas for the distructions .This Movie India's sons really talks about the sons of India which is a matter of giving a notice today. Kudos to Deepika, Shonee, Neeraj and all the people who dared to hold the torch to show the light on this issue we have never seen or tried to look even.Must watch to reclaim your guts to see the harsh reality.",False
3,10,Bitter truth revealed in a sweet way,sunnykeys,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is a much needed product of the time. I am doing research on this topic and it has helped me to understand about false accusations, it's impact on the individual and family. The laws were grossly misused by women, yet government is silent about it. Recently, Supreme Court has rejected the pil for National Commission for Men. And these so called judges after retirement, start supporting men's rights. Anyway, Thanks to Deepika Narayan Bharadwaj and team for the efforts for bringing this important issue to light. Hoping for many more documentaries and films on men's issues in your direction.",False
4,10,A Must Watch for Everyone,robinjosej,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another splendid documentary film that is really an eye-opener for indians to see the injustice towards men. A must watch for every Indian, specially the law makers, police , judges and the ministers to see what it feels to be innocent yet be behind bars due to false cases , how it feels to go on court dates for years just to hear one self innocent , face media trails ,then friends, neighbors and family boycott you on mere allegations by women, , just imagine after fighting for years to prove your innocence , you will see the women who accused you walks scot free because no punshment given in filling false cases. Kudos to Deepika and team for both her documentaries ""
India's Sons & Martyrs of marriage , both are excellent and a must watch. Let's stand for true equality. Jai Hind.",False
5,10,"Must watch, shows reality.",lasertbss,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie shows todays halat in courts and how the laws a so heavily biased against men, getting married is crime for men in this country. This movie shows glimpses of what can go wrong and how wrong can it go. Men are being milked for money in every way possible by the system. I have no other words to add beyond this and hence I continue to write pointlessly just to add words to a review that is well reviewed. Anyway this is pointless to write please dont waste your time to read beyond this as u know that this is pointless as pointless as a srk movie, or a salman movie or any other story less movie for that matter.",False
6,10,An eye opener,mburmee,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's one of those rare movies which brings to light the 'other side'. A movie about real survivors, the people who are falsely accused. Cases which are not talked about or highlighted by the media. A must watch.For me the movie was an experience. It gave me the goosebumps and my eyes were heavy. It is a movie which every young person should go and watch and understand what can happen to a person, a family if falsely accused. I believe this movie can bring about a change in society. I have never ever heard or seen any work of this sort which can move you soul and make you ask questions. Great production! Marvelous direction!",False

8,10,Raises an issue less spoken off,pranav-mistry,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a world where hyper feminism is misinterpreted in different ways. This films dives into the very law that was designed to protect the dignity of a woman, and how it has been misused in several instances and till what extent someone can go out of greed or vendetta or get rich quick attitude.A crisp 90 minute film, takes you through cases with real people involved and from the lens of the director you observe how the life changing situation has affected the victims, its presented with legit facts and expert opinions.I came across this film through social media and its exhibited through their website. Definitely deserves a watch if you care about social causes and human ethics in general.",False
9,9,Pure Reality!!,saaahilcooolkilller,n/a,16/08/2025,Hits Hard! It's a MUST WATCH! I would like to thank Deepika narayan Bhardwaj and her team to make a documentary on such a serious topic. It showcases the reality of the society at this point. It's unbelievable how a person can be so cruel and poison the basic foundation of marriage. I hate to say this but women have been playing the victim card for a very long period of time. And this documentaries shows exactly the same that how they actually pull this off. How weak a man can become and has to surrender under immense pressure created by a false case. No help from the authorities or the law. Hats off to this iron lady who is stepping up and speaking for these helpless men. I hope these documentaries reach to the concerned people and they go ahead and change or reform some of the laws to create equilibrium in the society. It's the need of the hour.,False
10,10,"Real Stories, Real Problems, Real Solutions.",rishikeshwagh8,n/a,16/08/2025,"Takes on a criminally underrated issue in the society. Gives you a good understanding of the problem, highlights these problems using real cases containing real CCTV footage, real interviews of victims, real tears.No unnecessary dramatization or sensationalization.

Do yourself and your friends/family a favour and watch and share this documentary.",False
11,10,Pretty much the truth,secretsantajamesbond,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie is close to the reality and an eye opener. Spare some time and I am pretty sure you won't be disappointed by this movie. The harsh truth of our society, the hasth truth of a man's life and the harsh truth of how inclined are laws and policies to punish someone just because of a particular gender. This movie can actually help you to find reasons why you should not be judgemental towards someone just because you are not aware of the whole situation. I would say go and watch it and keep mind open and neutral to understand the reality of so many people out there. Thanks for all the efforts.",False
12,1,It's more like a PowerPoint presentation than a documentary,alishakaran,n/a,16/08/2025,The subject was very sensitive and worth of making a documentary but this documentary failed to do justice with the subject. This is just like a power point presentation of few random incidents. Someone shall make it with better research and efforts. For now this looks like just a publicity stunt istead of highlighting a serious issue. Direction is poor and so is the script. There is no continuity in the script. In short it looks like that the director was under the pressure to make something and so he made it without doing any proper research on the subject. Camera work also is very poor. Overall a good opportunity gt wasted out.,False
13,10,Well research,amreshkashyapamar,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerNice üëè it's awesome to see such a fantastic episode.. In this country men suffer more about such thing. Any Government and law is not equal for men and women. Men suffering so much such a false misled case and alimony case. Recnt news regarding hardik pandya divorces case . I personally fell same type of aliomy case. After divorce men are suffering more. So people of country and law maker must make such a law where equal distribution of right not on gender bases. Men in this country note only victim of law but case take so much time. Which spoiled men life.. I prey for all gender.. God give courage to fight against the evil.,True
14,10,Boys Beware. Great Documentary,Buiejames,n/a,16/08/2025,This is splendid documentary featuring a real life case. This should be an eye opener for the Indian men. I was actually shocked to watch this as an NRI. Never knew all this was going on in India. Men need to be careful now falling in this legal Mumbo-Jumbo. Documentary is done very tastefully. The writer and director did lot of homework on this project. She has done extensive research and work on these kind of cases. Deepikaji hats off to be consistently helping the men selflessly. I hope this kind of documentary is shown in every channel. Boys and Men learn from this and be smart with your relationships.,False

Many people are not aware of the biased laws and trauma accused families face due to false allegations, which are entirely wrong and were never proven.A must-watch by every Indian & should be spread via social platforms among the masses.

16,10,Must Watch,merarajpat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another excellent documentary that truly opens Indians' eyes to the injustice done to men. A must-watch for all Indians, but especially for legislators, law enforcement, judges, and ministers. It shows what it's like to be innocent and yet be imprisoned because of false accusations; it also shows what it's like to attend court for years only to be told you're innocent; it exposes you to the public; and finally, after years of defending yourself against accusations made by women, friends, neighbors, and family turn against you. Imagine that after spending years proving your innocence, the women who accused you walk free because no punishment was meted out for filing false accusations. Bravo for both of Deepika's documentaries, along with her team. The Sons and Martyrs of India.",False
17,10,Addresses the lesser talked topic,operationsresearchmadesimple,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film puts hold that part of the society, which most dare not touch! Kudos to the team, for this bold yet essential step.In today's world, men's right are one of the least talked about topic. For a functional society, both males and females are important. Females' rights should be hold high, not an iota of doubt about that. But often mens' suffering are ignored. This film touches upon that issue, with a lot of emotion and awesome expression by the actors and actresses.Actors and actresses have put up so nicely, such an important yet rarely touched topic of today's society.Often men suffers in silence, this film upholds that brilliantly.",False
18,10,A Conscience stirring film,ashishbht-67447,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentry for the first time gives a voice to those unfortunate men who have faced the tragedy of laws being misused against them by women. Unfortunately such stories have been totally brushed aside by the media till now. It stirred so many emotions inside me. The individual stories are very poignant. This Documentary has covered the problem from many angles. There is judicial and social apathy for men's problems. Law enforcement is unprofessional and biased against men. The attitude of the government is such that it is ok to sacrifice 10 innocent men for 1 women. In this cause of gender justice, Men have received a bad deal from on all fronts. This film will create awareness about all such things and will be a great leap forward for men's right. Great job!",False

21,1,It's more like a PPT presentation,del_rahul,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's more like a PPT presentation than a movie or a documentary. Not found it worth ful. It was a good subject but they failed to do justice with the subject and issue. Seems the director lacks the desired expertise to direct and document a subject like this. Just calling something a documentary does not make it a documentary. It lacks proper case studies , data, efforts and work made by different people and organisation in this area and all. It just looks like a jumble of four incidents and that does not make it a documentary. Hope someone else wil make a better one on this subject because we really needs to talk about this sensitive topic.",False

24,10,Truth Always wins,singhp-00619,n/a,16/08/2025,"The plot twists in the movie kept me on the edge of my seat.

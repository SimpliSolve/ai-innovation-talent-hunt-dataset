2,9,This kids got it. Amazing Storyteller!,ashleykm-00991,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've never even heard of this guy, & now it's safe to say I'm a huge fan. I'm so happy to have found this as I needed something really good & this certainly qualifies. He reminded me of mix between maybe Nick Kroll & M. Broderick? But then I got my friend to watch it (they also loved & appreciated it) & they mentioned him being similar to the energy, wit & stage presence of Paul Reuben's & Robin Williams (I agree!).So clever & entertaining! He mixes a good balance of important issues with great, well timed comedy. Being Jewish, Nazis etc. Tough topics & still sprinkles fun stories within other stories. I loved all of it & would highly recommend.",False
3,9,I love his voice!,UniqueParticle,n/a,15/08/2025,"Alex Edelman seems like he'd be perfect for a Big Mouth voice, I watched that series recently it's very good! Anyway I was interested in this the last weeks it's been advertised plenty on HBO. I like how bold Alex is, ironically too my name is Alex although the comedian is quite funny and very entertaining at his craft. I appreciate the mix of stories, cleanness, very silly, and sometimes bold mashed well. This is a great stand up I should watch more of them I miss a few classic ones like Dane Cook, Lewis Black, Jim Gaffigan, and Louis CK before he got cancelled. I'm not sure about others but I love this, glad autism is mentioned since I have it.",False
4,n/a,Can you believe it?,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Surprising find. Engaging and clever performance. He follows tangents but unfailingly ties it all back and returns to the deliver the central story. I had never heard of Alex Edelman but was fishing around on streaming services hoping to find another engaging stand up comedy performance, dipping my toe in for 10 or 15 minutes and finding so many duds. I found this show very entertaining and have watched it twice now. I had checked out all the comedians interviewed by Seinfeld on Cars and coffee, Bill Burr and friends, HBO specials, Netflix specials... found some gems to be sure, but so, so many disappointments. You can only watch so many stand up sets filled with content the performer is claiming is off bounds and cannot be joked about, but oh so bravely soldiers regardless for the entire show. Some can pull this off with real talent, but that's the exceptional performers. This will be too left for some and too intellectual for others, Edelman is clearly highly intelligent and this is a tight and incredibly well polished show. Highly recommended. I look forward to his future work.",False
5,8,funny standup comic. tells it like it is.,ksf-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"The standup of alex edelman. Lots of jewish jokes. And anti-semite jokes! Conversations about koko the gorilla... and when they told him robin williams had died. He's very animated... he never stops moving around the stage. How to deal with the haters, and nazi's... at their own meetings. Because he went to one! What to say in awkward conversations; jared kushner, and why he's so loud in temple. Alex's boston roots. His brother, the olympian. Jokes about the royal family. How hanukah really works, and why it's not better than christmas! Families, babies. Really funny. Good stuff. From new york city, on max streaming. Funny stuff. Directed by alex timbers.",False
6,8,So professional SO talented and very funny,orcinussr,n/a,15/08/2025,"And overall extremely entertaining, i don't know if it's the hyper polish ((that's polish as in rub till smooth, not.. You know - Warsaw haha (sorry)) after being on Broadway and all but Sheesh-what a show! And yes, I'm a Jew or more accurately Jew-ish and it should be stipulated that this adds to the experience, cause we can relate to so much of this, even with the 'ish' suffix in full bloom -and I wanna add that there's an element of vainglorious pride watching and hearing Alex, so understand there is some bias but objectively I would and will recommend this. (and of you are wondering about the 8, well... That's high for me, i reserve tens for stuff like Attenborough documentaries and thr 9s goto Rick and Morty sooo)",False
7,10,SO HYSTERICAL AND POIGNANT,MatildaSzy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hands down the funniest comedy special I've seen in a really long time. SO GOOD!!!! I was laughing nonstop and was laughing so hard I was crying. And I watch a lot of comedy.Kudos to Alex Edelman for being so honest and so brave not only in his comedy but as a human. We should all take notes.I am telling all my friends to watch this and those that have already on my recommendation, all said ""THIS IS SO GOOD!""I look forward to his next project!I missed seeing this live in the theatre and was bummed over that so I'm elated that I was able to see it on TV as this is truly incredibly funny stand up.",False
8,10,Thoughtful and incisive,kyxdrnp,n/a,15/08/2025,"Best of comedy...takes you on a journey, and leaves you pondering in the end. Edelman makes a strong effort at sizing up elements of American culture, and particularly his intersection with it in his own identity. It's worth watching and thinking about. He tells a story in his standup, thoroughly excising tidbits of our cultural complex that formulate the jigsaw of Americanism. He shows why it's so difficult to be yourself in a society where performative SELF is a constant necessity, hiding or downplaying your identity in ways that might be unexpected to audiences unfamiliar with the straddling of whiteness.",False
9,10,A Jew walks into a Broadway theater...,pebsdad,n/a,15/08/2025,"The best way to describe this is performance standup. This is a much loved Broadway ""show"" that everyone was trying to get their friends to go see and raving about everywhere. Alex also toured this show to a few cities but never reached me and I'm so glad I'm getting to see it here. It reminds me of the great Hannah Gadsby sets where a general theme is presented, expanded on, digressed from and told in a story manner. The callbacks are brilliant and I have never sat in my living room and howled, snorted and spilled my beverage to anyone before. This is smart performance, physical humor that eclipses all those high paid comedians who aren't really funny (they know who they are). I hope he comes up with another show and we get to journey again with him. I will introduce this to friends and watch is over and over.",False
10,10,Touched with genius,paulromney03-568-287877,n/a,15/08/2025,"I approached this show knowing nothing about Edelman and not expecting anything above the mediocre standup norm. I found myself laughing like I was listening to Robin Williams. I'm not saying that he's as funny as Williams, but he's funnier than anyone else I remember hearing in years.Like Williams, whose name he drops more than once, Edelman presents as manic and on the spectrum. But in fact his act is extremely focused and disciplined. He conjures up a scene and a cast of characters, and his apparently manic movements around the stage are artfully choreographed to that end. He strikes me as a true original, not as anyone's clone. As a reviewer once wrote of S. J. Perelman, just before they made him they broke the mold.",False
11,1,Painful and dull,eeyow,n/a,15/08/2025,"I made it to the 20 minute mark and bailed. The guy is just not funny. Talks fast and says nothing. His bits are long-winded with no pay off. Couldn't even muster a smirk. Don't waste your time. Probably the worst comedian I've seen in a long time. No cringe for cringe's sake just unfunny. Pretty sure this guy has got a relative who helped him out. THere's no way he could've gotten a show on his own. Rambling about being jewish like anybody cares about that one way or the other. As neurotic as he was, Woody Allen was a funny stand-up. This guy is no woody allen, maybe wooden edelman would be more appropriate. Like watching paint dry.",False
12,9,Alex Edelman: Just for Us - A Hilarious and Insightful Journey,briankoster-47805,n/a,15/08/2025,"Alex Edelman truly knows how to tell a story. In ""Just for Us,"" he masterfully weaves tales from his own life and experiences. While his family has certainly provided him with some memorable anecdotes, none quite compare to the pivotal event that inspired this remarkable show.This particular performance centers on one extraordinary event: Edelman, a Jewish man, attends a meeting of white nationalists. His motivation? To ""understand"" them - to grasp their perspectives and the roots of their beliefs. One might question the thoroughness of his pre-meeting contemplation; personally, I wouldn't have ventured within a mile of such a gathering. However, because he did, we are gifted with a collection of incredibly funny and insightful stories.I cannot recommend this show enough. Take the hour and a half to relax and immerse yourself in this amazing narrative. You certainly won't regret it.",False
13,1,Tedtalk about his life,baka_land,n/a,15/08/2025,"Reminds me of the bit Doug Stanhope did, about those people who just circle around their astrological sign, or their race/ethnicity or their religion. Everything is about that and everything circles back to that.He's an otter when using a cellphone and he's a jew so everyone on twitter hates him... It was hard to watch because it wasn't comedy but a person who is just telling his daily routine about how he fights anti-semitism by making lists and going to random places to complete jig-saw puzzles and identifying nazis as if it was his birth right. If you are into stories, unfunny ones, alex maybe the guy for you.",False

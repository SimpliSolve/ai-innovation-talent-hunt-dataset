1,8,What a Hoot!,alisonc-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"A group of bus drivers, mechanics and sundry workers from Dorset form an amateur theatre company and decide to create a stage play based on the movie ""Alien,"" complete with full monster suit. Not only is their inventiveness and tenacity showcased, but the production in their small community is ""discovered"" by a London impressario, who brings the whole cast and crew (the latter frequently but not always being part of the former, amateur theatrics being what they are) to stage a single performance of their show in the West End, where of course it receives much acclaim and love. ""Alien on Stage"" is a documentary about this fantastic feat, and as such is a real treat for movie and theatre lovers alike. My only regret is that I saw this as part of Virtual Fantasia 2021, which means at home without the brilliant Fantasia audience - this would only be better if seen with a full house of like-minded cinephiles. Great fun!",False
2,8,Yes it's possible,redtiago,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw it at MotelX.Very good documentary about an amateur theater group from Dorset who in good time decided to stage a play based on the horror film classic ""Alien"".Shows with tact and sensitivity, often this type of documentaries, even if unintentionally, end up to a certain extent by ridiculing the protagonists, this is not the case.Shows the journey from the group, the rehearsals, the techniques as they made the props, the not very successful debut, the surprising invitation to one of the main theaters in London (London West End Theatre), the trip to London, the normal nervousness , the clash of the size of the stage, the focal points of the performance until the consecration with the stand up ovation from he audience.A lot of fun, just like a Rick Gervaise sitcom, but clearly spontaneous and genuine.It makes us want to go see the play asap!",False
3,6,A bittersweet watch,MattyLuke-81663,n/a,16/08/2025,"""And here's to the fools who dream
Crazy as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that break
Here's to the mess we make""'Alien on Stage' is a documentary about a group of Dorset Bus Drivers spent a year creating a serious stage adaptation of the sci-fi, horror film, Alien. With wobbly sets, awkward acting and special effects requiring more luck than judgement.Out of all the films I saw at the Leeds International Film Festival, this was the most heartfelt thing I saw at the festival. No matter how crazy your idea is, or if you have any skills, or wherever you may be from, or how you may sound in other people's ears, the documentary proves that despite all odds it is possible, no matter what.You do get a great sense of community here, a small community that gets discovered by the ""big heads"" of London theatre and brings the whole cast and crew to stage a single performance of their show in the West End.The doc follows the rehearsal period, the making of the props (including a built alien size costume), the stress and worry, the trip to London, and the nerves on show day.All leading to a satisfying conclusion. A bittersweet watch.",False
4,n/a,Wonderful,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I worked on the original Alien (1979) and have just watched your documentary and wanted to congratulate all involved in ""Alien On Stage"". It was such a life-affirming project. Not only did it show the original movie is loved so much, but it showed the utter creative value of art-from-the-heart on a shoestring. I laughed and cheered and clapped with the West End audience and even shed a tear. Bravo to everyone involved. And we did'nt exactly have a huge budget to make the original film. But lack of resources can oftimes produce wonders, as you guys did. Which was to lift the human spirit. Thank you so very much. Keep working and keep your Sense Of Wonder!",False
5,9,As great a film as its inspiration.,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"The title should be enough reason to see this. That's right, Alien.... on stage! Although technically, this is actually a behind the scenes documentary about an amateur dramatic stage production of Alien, by a bunch of Dorset bus drivers. Brilliant! Deciding to try something different from the traditional pantomime, they embark on a bold retelling of a sci-fi horror classic. This is ambitious stuff. ""I can't imagine how you convert that into a stage drama"" says one player, but that's the point. No one in their right mind would attempt this. It's just a bunch of regular people. Trying something creative. DIY props, costumes. It's all a bit rough and ready, but made with love and you know what, some of it is really good! In fact, all of it is really good!! We're introduced to the cast and crew in their daily lives, driving buses, talking about practicing lines. None of them have done anything like this before, the props guy watched some YouTube videos to figure out how to make the pods, facehugger, the alien, but he's a natural. ""I hope everything does what Ridley Scott wanted it to do, but in a more basic format"". The story though isn't just the valiant production. It's its failure and rebirth. You see it seems it didn't catch the Dorset locals attention on its first presentation. But the makers of this doc loved it! Not only that, but with a bit of buzz created and some crowdfunding, they set out to do it again, for one night, in the West End. Honestly there's a lot going on, but it's the people that make this tick. Everyone's so bloody lovely it's impossible not to root for them. There is tension, but only with the clock ticking down on the big night. They're a tight team, having a laugh. It's playful, delightful, quintessentially British. I don't mean foppy period drama British, or chavy influencer obsessed British. This is what Britain is really like. Regular people, getting by and being unassumingly brilliant. Watching them rehearse, you're wondering if they can actually pull this off. ""We are going to struggle"" Director Dave says, but despite all the butterflies, the enthusiasm is infectious. It's seat of your pants stuff and absolutely wonderful! A great story, told perfectly. Pure joy.",False

1,8,"A ""limited hangout"", but well worth a watch",mcantelon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ignore the suspicously odd number of super low reviews. This documentary is flawed, but well worth a watch. Addressing the flaws first: it's a bit plodding at times and there are parts that could have been clearer. It also seems to throw the main information under the bus to some degree (perhaps pulling back to lessen the possiblity of blowback for making it). Is it biased? Probably (it's on Netflix, after all). Does it tell the whole story? Nope.It is, however, very much still worth a watch. It offers some fresh examples of how the world actually works: evidence that's buried by the police, murderous criminals who do little/no time (because they also work for powerful people), intelligence operatives posing as humanitarians, ""whistleblowers"" who dole out disinformation and try to determine what you actually know, intersection of intelligence organizations and organized crime, etc.If you aren't already somewhat familiar with the world of covert operations like the CIA's role in the crack cocaine epidemic you might assume all of what's in the documentary is made up, but the world is a strange place.",False
2,7,Is interesting but too complex...,tarascopablo,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis documentary is very interesting but in my personal opinion is way too complex for just 4 episodes.I believe the information given to the viewer is way too dense to comprehend and absorb in 4 episodes and rather a 6-8 episodes series would have been better in order for all the facts to be better presented and also allow all the characters in the story to have enough time to be presented.This case is very interesting and what i liked is that both the journalist and the director had a critical eye while also remaining objetive. They heard all versions but tried to form their own criteria instead of believing everything form everyone.A must watch.,True
3,7,Worth a watch,EmtertainMe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerEnjoyed it better than many other docs from Netflix. They didn't reuse the same footage over and over endlessly. Sure it doesn't come to an actual conclusion but that was never going to happen 30 years later with unreliable witnesses. I was enthralled at first and hoping for more meat on the bone. A valiant effort to follow the leads and leave no stone unturned.Worth a watch. Reminded me a little of Mister Organ. The investigative journalists in both get so deeply wrapped into this web of mystery and lies that, to Christian's point, disrupts and alters his sense of reality. He is forever changed.",True
4,7,Well made but lacked the big answers,LeeLeeds,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe first episode set up series really well, but ultimately I don't feel like we had enough answers or strong enough theories by the conclusion of part 4.The show is really well made and had some interesting concepts and ways of telling the story including the recreations, the graphics, the fly-on-the-wall style calls and car rides. The soundtracks was great too.But as mentioned we finish episode one thinking that this suicide might be something else and end episode 4 in exactly the same position. Even if we had a couple more answers, it would of left some sense of 'satisfaction' of investing 4 hours of watch time.",True
5,6,A Trip Down Rabbit Hole(s),TMAuthor23,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary series is watchable and interesting on multiple levels. On the surface, the mystery behind the death of Casolaro, an investigative journalist who dies while in pursuit of his journalistic White Whale. Did he take his own life? Or was he murdered?The second layer, not obvious at first, is the perilous prospect of diving head first into a rabbit hole, and the affect on a person's sanity and grip on reality, when one rabbit hole inevitably leads to more.The third tragic layer is the damage you can feel from all the peripheral players. Family and friends of Casolaro's as well as the investigators involved (including the documentarians) are haunted by his death, and the labyrinthian tentacles of a corrupt network too big to solve.The unreliable narratives, shady interviewees and second hand (sometimes third or fourth) information spin wheels that often go nowhere. We even get a bizarre claim about the veracity of the Zapruder film that will cause thousands of internet searches.What can't be argued are the disturbing patterns of convenient missing data, witnesses and disinterested authorities. In the last episode, the file on Casolaro's death is opened, revealing a key piece of information that was hidden/ignored/forgotten that would have changed the entire course of his murder investigation.The internecine threads of government corruption, illegal and immoral surveillance are, by turns, shocking but unsurprising.Ultimately, as a documentary there are quality issues that can't be ignored, and more than a few confusing photo montages that don't shed any light...on anything.But, in the end, tantalized by another random phone call, our investigator, who has seemed to break away from the demented allure of mass conspiracy, allows himself to be drawn in once again.A cautionary tale to be sure.",False
6,9,Netflix should do more of these,lachseb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the kind of documentaries that stand out from the Netflix average trendy true crime docuseries and makes our subscription worthwhile. It's full of historical informations, not over dramatized and well narrated. This is a great tribute to Danny Caselaro's work. So to the main investigator of this doc Christian Hansen : Bravo ! It seems that this investigation took years of your life but it was worth it (+ you're still alive). Your doc helps clear some of the fog of history around the shitshow that was the 70's and 80's, it's so refreshing and entertaining !Kudos to the Netflix producers that trusted you and financed this doc, we want more docs like this ! You tapped into a vein of gold right there, keep going !",False
7,7,"Bit of a flat ending, but still a good watch.",cb_whitewood,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this blind, in the mood for something suspicious and thrilling to ring in autumn...ACTOM fit the bill pretty well! The production of this documentary really keeps you hanging off everyone's last word, trying to piece together what could possibly have happened. The characters in this scheme are bizarre, interesting people, and the rabbit hole just keeps going deeper...Until it doesn't. The twist at the end really felt like ""Wait, I watched all of that for this?!"" By no means do I mean the ""verdict"" is far-fetched or unbelievable, but the final episode and wrap-up to this series was such a belly-flop of nothing compared to all the build-up the previous episodes had.Not a bad watch, but unsatisfying ending in my opinion.",False
8,9,Hunger for Truth,Pequod88,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are known knowns and known unknowns. I seem to recall a member of a criminal administration saying that.This high caliber documentary does not pretend the behemoth of a story can ever be wrapped up in tidy fashion. There are far too many tentacles, so to speak. Yet much is uncovered. Facts are learned. Suspicions confirmed. New questions raised, new unknowns discovered. Every stone turned over can reveal a new fact, danger, helper, criminal, or crazy. This documentary is the book the almost certainly murdered Danny Casolaro did not live to finish and so much more.It has been confirmed by numerous sources that members of the soon to be elected Reagan administration had the will and the contacts to delay the release of the Iran hostages for great political gain. The same administration bypassed congress to illegally sell arms to Nicaraguan Contras. Reagan claimed to forgotten most everything when finally put on the stand.The Promis software had a backdoor. It was sold to allies and used to spy on them as the money was counted. Government agencies and former employees did brisk business. Electing former CIA head Bush exasperated shady dealings and clandestine violence. What's a few more bodies when the money is so good?Investigator Christian Hansen can never stop asking questions, never learn enough. Sign posts along the rabbit hole that claimed Danny crop up, but he keeps digging, much to his credit. We are left with many disturbing facts, informed speculation, helpful informers, troubled witnesses with a foot in each world, and plenty to ponder.Dead men tell no tales. Many have been silenced. Others fear to speak up. Some share truths tainted by justifiable paranoia. The film does not claim to have all the answers or even all the questions. But bravery and dogged curiosity are a dangerous combination. It is to viewers' benefit that Hansen dug deep. We can make of it what we will, going forward a little wiser and better informed. Recommended.",False
9,6,Interesting but slow,beccapritch,n/a,16/08/2025,"Committed by the second episode, was slightly irked it never really concluded after 4 hours investment.That's all I have to say really, now filling up characters to suit IMDB. Lead along on the premise that something exciting would happen; it never did. Totally appreciate that's perhaps part of the appeal for some people - for me it was just quite frustrating after investing so much time.Quite hard to follow at times with lots of names etc. Sounds like in the end all the characters were insane, almost rendering the whole exercise useless. I just felt disappointed at the end after investing so much time.",False
10,5,"A lot of speculation, no substance",Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc series had a great start, delving into the suspicious death of an investigative journalist who was knee deep in government conspiracies. Unfortunately, it never goes any deeper. Documenters force you to watch countless minutes of news flashbacks pertaining to a myriad of different scandals but never draw conclusions or make new discoveries. The two 'journalists' simply come to the same conclusions that their predecessor did but have just as little proof. There are far too many people involved and far too many events dragged in for a person to come out on the other end of this doc remembering even one shred of it all.",False
11,9,Finally a documentary that needed to be made!,orcinussr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well done and worth watching, definitely contains merit and is presented in a fair manner - - so as always I have to comment on how, in the case of documentaries, the metric of review is significantly different than in a film for entertainment, right? Cause one (the reviewer) must decide if they're gonna to be critical of the subject matter or, rather, the technical aspects of the film - ie it may be a worthwhile topic (although to be fair this is entirely subjective and I guess the documentarian can't be faulted for what they feel is worthy or what they want to explore?!) but be presented very poorly and vica versa - in short, in the case of this film BOTH are worthwhile, but I'm reviewing more the film as a whole.",False
12,7,An all encompassing conspiracy,Pairic,n/a,16/08/2025,"American Conspiracy: The Octopus Murders: Documentary series which explores the death of journalist Danny Casolaro and the conspiracies he was investigating at the time of his death. It very much looks as if he was murdered and the the death scene staged to look like suicide, But was he killed by state agents or killers acting on behalf of organised crime? The documentary uncovers credible evidence that officials in the Justice Department acted to steal software from it's legitimate owners and hand ir over to those who had political connections, Other murders are involved not to mention some of those who crop up in the investigation having links to the Iran-Contra affair. Some former state assets may have been set up and/oe killed because of loose lips. We are dealing with the intersection of the Intelligence Community with Organised Crime. A good documentary but it tries to cover too many issues and becomes convoluted and confusing at times. Directed by Zachary Treitz. Four episodes on Netflix. 7/10.",False
13,5,Slow moving & lots of speculation,adamosterman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Overall it's very interesting content. The intelligence community seems as dark and shady as we all imagined. Honestly, it's probably far worse than we could ever imagine and any documentary could ever portray. This documentary moves at a snails pace. At times it feels scattered and likely missing parts. I understand that's part of a conspiracy theory but by the end it's difficult to keep the timeline straight enough to make a proper conclusion for yourself. Aggravating ending. Kudos to the film makers for digging up the research and interviews though. You can see the time they put into it. Unfortunately it just misses the mark overall in the end.",False
14,7,A bit different than other true crime stories,kofila,n/a,16/08/2025,After watching this I am still not sure.. Mostly about.. well.. anything. This is too big of a story. So big it makes you wonder if it is even possible but at the same time it somehow feels very possible and almost common. A conspiracy so wild and wide it is almost infinite. But what makes it different is the point of view. In this documentary you are part of the crew trying to decipher it all as well as a witness of an obsession that can possess you if you get to deep. If there is a mystery so profound including so many parts and questions it might never stop and it might just take you down with it. For more reasons.,False
15,6,"Promising start, slow middle, meh end",adam_cross,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary starts off quite strong, diving straight into a crazy mix of government coverups, international crime, and the mysterious death of journalist Danny Casolaro. The first episode really hooks you in, making you feel like you're about to uncover the mother of all conspiracies.But then, about halfway through, things start to lose steam. The story gets way too complicated, with so many angles and side plots that it's hard to keep track of what's actually important. They throw in tons of theories, different cases, and connections, but they don't really follow through on most of them. It feels like the show is trying to cover everything, and in doing that, it doesn't really cover anything deeply enough.One thing I didn't really like is that the producers start questioning their own story. They cast doubt on Danny's work and even some of the key sources they've been leaning on. At first, you're fully invested, thinking, ""Wow, this guy uncovered something huge,"" but by the middle of the series, you're left wondering if any of it is real or if Danny was just piecing together random stuff. Don't get me wrong, it's good to ask tough questions, but the way they handle it feels messy.The two big mysteries/questions they focus on are "" Was Danny murdered or did he commit suicide?"", and ""What exactly is The Octopus?"", neither of these questions really get resolved. There's a lot of speculation about both, but no clear answers. The show goes back and forth between presenting Danny as a brilliant investigator who uncovered a massive conspiracy and as someone who might've connected dots that weren't actually there. I understand that they must analyse both angles, it just seems a bit wrong when they start going down the mental health/suicide route considering there wasn't any conclusive evidence.The ending is a bit of a mixed bag. They manage to get access to Danny's original case files, which was exciting, and it does shed some light on the circumstances around his death, I wish they went deeper into this. But it doesn't bring any big revelations, and it definitely doesn't tie everything together. You get a bit of closure, but not enough to feel fully satisfied.Overall, The Octopus Murders has its moments. It's a fascinating story, and the early episodes are packed with tension and intrigue. But as it goes on, it gets bogged down by too many loose threads and an unclear direction. If you're into true crime and don't mind a lot of unanswered questions, it's worth checking out. Just be prepared for a show that raises more questions than it answers.",True
16,9,Something Everyone Overlooked?,schohunter,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust wanted to mention that something that seemed to be overlooked. Danny himself told everyone he was going to be murdered in the ""suicide note."" If you are at all religious, you know that suicide is the unforgivable sin, meaning you will not be able to go to Heaven if you commit suicide. Danny's literal last words that anyone know of are ""Don't worry - God will let me in"" a clear reference to the fact that he was not committing the Unforgivable Sin of suicide.This documentary was riveting. I am not very ""tech savvy,"" and lean more toward murder mysteries than government conspiracies, but this one had me hooked. I'm not sure I was satisfied, but I was interested.",True
17,6,Season 2???,frog_queenuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was immediately hooked by this in ep. 1
I did however by end of ep. 4 feel cheated!Did I get sucked into a conspiracy theory and feel let down by lack of conclusion. What was the Real Story that Michael referred to?Is there any truth in all this large web of information?I honestly thought from the way Zach introduced Christian in ep. 1 that he had met a grizzly end like Danny...His was no suicide.. maintenance guy saw his body on the floor behind bathroom door...
The EMT said the blood splatter was not consistent with a suicide - it certainly looked more like a struggle
Then there is the eye witness letter and sketchIt all stinks to high heaven and his family deserves justice.There is more to this and i hope we get to find out.",True
18,10,Scary to think of hit men involved with US government,tarajil41,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is really scary and I'm sure it's true, why not kill anyone who gets in your way, when you're the US government? It's effective and efficient. Now for my pet peeve, please get rid of ringing telephones. I know it's a sound effect, not a real ringing phone. Editors just plopped it in there and upped the volume. Landlines and mobile phones rang out startling me as I was engrossed in this above average, cool and mysterious documentary about a book that would have been really great if Danny ever lived to publish it! I've watched and read about the CIA. In the past they definitely used dirty tricks. Fantastic documentary!",False
19,6,Good introduction to Danny's case but a biased view.,tataricibatman,n/a,16/08/2025,"The upside of this documentary is the fact that the journalists did a great job of presenting what Danny Casolaro wrote and thought about what was going on in the case he was investigating, as well as making some discoveries of their own. They also interviewed a lot of witnesses at key events in the investigation, people who Danny collaborated with directly and their descendants. If you want to get into the mind of what this journalist was going through, this is a great documentary to watch.The downside of this documentary is that it is too partial, only showing the story through the vision of people who shared Danny's version of the events. This documentary could have tried to do what The Vietnam War by Ken Burns documentary did, and that is to reach out to people who supported the official story and then let the viewer decide which version of events is true.Personally, I believe the fault of the documentary lies in drawing conclusions without proper evidence, evidence that should have refute any other version of events.A lot of information is based on the legitimacy of the speaker, but it has been proven many times that witness statements can be faulty, an aspect that was made popular by the movie Twelve Angry Men.What about the letter? The documentary doesn't even talk about it and tacitly remarks that it was genuine. Why would a person write it and then be killed?In conclusion, we should believe a person to be innocent until proven guilty and not the opposite even when we are talking about people in powerful positions. The documentary's job should have been that of informing the viewer and not inciting him and fueling his paranoia. Every thesis should have enough evidence to be able to confirm that said version was the only possible one.",False
20,5,Journalist Director Syndrome - Makes this a slow one !,proabhinav,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story that unravels throughout the series is amazing , revealing and matters ..Challenge is that when a journalist wishes to direct his own story the way he wants , which may or may not be able to depict the story really well , the entire effort goes to waste.The series went on a drag , at times unnecessary details and opinions: expressions ..This documentary had the opportunity to be in the league of some of earlier best Netflix shows like The Keepers, How to Fix A Srug Scandal and many more but this one fails ..Worthy effort and journalism .. but sometimes let the best people do their job . Thank you.",False
21,9,Intriguing documentary series,NicolaTesla,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA well produced , written, filmed, scored and edited , though typical 'Neflixeske' series which ends a bit obscure. The build up is quit intriguing and creates a sense of what 'getting devoured by conspiracy theories
' feels likes, suddenly at the close of the series, jumps the shark by taking , in my opinion, the easy way out.I might be wrong if there there's a season 2 with more compelling proof and follow-ups to all the claims made in this series but for now I'm rating this high because of the quality and entertainment value. This review is based on a single binge watch of the complete series. Compliments to the body of work that went into gathering everything into one series.",True
22,6,"Well Presented, But With A Lot of Bias",anythinghorrorscott,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI can remember reading about Casolaro & the unfolding PROMIS software case back in the 1990s. This documentary presents the info well enough but it seems to have already made up its mind as to Casolaro's death & whether there's a conspiracy within the first 2 minutes of the first episode. It doesn't seem very balanced.The segment with Riconosciuto was unnecessarily dramatic & felt staged.The 2 filmmakers here are too connected to the story to be unbiased and where they might be good at laying out the case for a conspiracy, they offer no evidence whatsoever.Danny Casolaro's story is worth being told. He can serve as a warning to other up & coming investigative reporters. Casolaro became obsessed.with the story he was working on and even in the face of underwhelming evidence for his claims, he tried to hammer a square peg into a round hole. And what about his health & the facts about his ""publisher.""This is a tragic story about obsession and about some definite wrong-doings (the Justice Dep't & PROMIS software) that needs to be told, but perhaps these weren't the right 2 filmmakers to tell this story.",True
23,4,Not factual with all elements of the story,eakline-11832,n/a,16/08/2025,"I lived through the event in Martinsburg WVA when it occurred and many facts that concluded suicide were left out of this documentary. The series doesn't tell you he was being treated for depression over a period of two plus years. The story doesn't tell you that many of his alleged encounters and other events were proven to be made up or better put... lies.He interacted with several people in Martinsburg when he was staying at the Sheraton and they would report a Lonely depressed individual who appeared somewhat detached from reality. The autopsy showed that only one of the wrist wounds was deep enough to severe a tendon and all others were superficial.If you want to investigate a better story in Martinsburg about the same time look up Martinsburg City Councilman Mile Lewis and you will then see a real sinister person and how unbalanced our justice system really is! Check it out, I promise you won't be disappointed !",False
24,7,"A big, sprawling story",silverton-37959,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerConsidering that Danny was attracted to this story by Bill Hamilton, president of Inslaw and a former NSA operative, it's possible that Danny was being led throughout his investigation by people on the inside of the criminal network with axes of their own to grind.The way the entire picture of what he found seemed to unfold, Danny was being handed false leads mixed with valid leads in order to direct him in his work the entire time. That he was eventually murdered by some of the targets of the investigation may not have been deliberate on the parts of his major sources, but it seems to me to be a case of depraved indifference to human life by those sources.One of Danny's contacts, Michael Riconosciuto, is a major source of confusion and misdirection for Danny and later for Christian. So much of what is being presented seems to be aimed at overloading the investigative journalists to the point that no cogent case of any particular crime can be made.The SFPD detectives state clearly that they were inundated with information on other crimes that ultimately sidetracked their investigation so that the murder they were investigating is still an open case 40+ years later. That kind of misdirection is probably typical of investigations into crimes involving US intelligence agency operatives.Watching the series and listening to what those sources admit in their own words could lead at least some of my fellow viewers to agree with my assessment.",True
25,7,Sorry for Danny and his family,rune-andresen,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is just another conspiracy series - Americans that believe in ghosts, UFOs and lizards.However - what makes this series standing out is the journalist in play and his family that is not the traditional white trash flyover state category.This is a story about a sane and educated person that got lost into conspiracy theories - which is interesting in itself. Hence, for once I would recommend to watch stupidity TV - Some people involved are indeed up to date and interesting.Exception is of course drug dealers and other people screaming for attention and see ghosts anywhere- so on and so forth.",False

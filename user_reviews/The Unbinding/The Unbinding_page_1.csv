1,5,As somebody who knew nothing about this movie before watching it...,silver_earthwax,n/a,15/08/2025,"Like I said in the title, I knew nothing about this film before watching it. It popped up on some random Amazon Prime list when I was in the mood for a horror movie, I googled the name and saw the RT and IMDB scores were decent, and I watched it.Looking at the reviews here, I have learned that the cast are actual real-life paranormal investigators, with a sizable fandom and a smattering of detractors (who seem to be duking it out in the reviews).And I am very confused. I keep trying to write a review, deleting it all, and starting over.I 100% thought it was a mockumentary. I'm still not sure that it isn't. I mean, I think it's certainly fiction, because I think paranormal stuff isn't real (sincerely sorry, not attempting to bash people's beliefs).But, I don't know if the cast also think it's not real. I mean, obviously they think paranormal stuff is real. But did these events happen? Or are they just a story they're telling? Or are they dramatizing something that kind of happened, and they're fancying it up with little creepy vignettes?And is this a deceptive thing? Like, are they positing that this is a 100% true story, and we're supposed to believe it's 100% true?Or, is it a real story that's been kind of dramatized for the film, and we're supposed to know that it is?Or, are these ghost hunters who are telling us a creepy fictional story, and we're supposed to know that it's just a fictional story?What level am I supposed to be watching this on?!When I thought this was a mockumentary, I thought it was pretty good. Naturalistic dialogue, great restraint with the scary parts, really believable relationships. I even thought some of the bit characters, like the Russian Studies professor, were fantastic actors.Of course, now that I know it's real, it's really thrown me for a loop. I think that, if I were to watch it again through that lens, I might have an entirely different take on the film. When I thought these people were actors, I thought they were doing a fantastic job. Now that I know they're actual paranormal investigators, I think it's kind of embarrassing, and more than a little self-aggrandizing.When I was still ignorant to the nature of the film, I thought all the goddess/folklore talk at the end of the movie was kind of smarmy and boring. I'm not a big fan of Horror movies that have a moralistic, happy ending. Basically, if the evil spirit gets put to rest, and the heroes live to fight another day, and we all learned something valuable, I'm not usually a big fan.But the rest of the film was fine, so I gave it a pass.But now, knowing that these people aren't actors, isn't that kind of....self-aggrandizing? They really believe they helped an ancient Slavic goddess? It's one thing to have a character say all this saccharine dialogue about beliefs and stuff, it's another thing entirely to just...say it.",False
2,6,"Cringy, weird and entertaining",decspv,n/a,15/08/2025,"In its favour, the movie is entertaining and presents a ""story"" pretty well. It relies a lot in the confusing / missing information as to maintain the expectation and mystery.Viewers are scratching their heads to make sense of it. That was well done. It maintains the focus.On the negative side, the story is too weird and cringy. The ancient being manipulates things around in a magic way, too magic and too directly.There are funny/silly parts such as when they carefully wrap the statue and lock the padlock carefully as to not disturb the entity and later they carry the box to the hill hanging it from the back while the box swings side to side... too much for carefully manipulating the statue...haha
The ""witch"" is doing a great role as the ""wisdom"" talker and at times she says things darn well.I think it is entertaining although it falls into the typical ghost / mystery enchanted objects movie but without the silly techniques other movies resource to.",False
3,1,Certainly not a documentary,seneschals,n/a,15/08/2025,"By no stretch of the imagination is this a documentary, not journalism, not contemporaneously filmed, no suggestion that it is fact, no evidence to demonstrate or support the idea that it is fact.It reminds me of the mockumentary style of the drowned man by Markiplier or some other similar efforts.If it weren't for the fact that it is a blatant attempt to draw susceptible wanna believes to their other content, if it wasn't for the fact that the production value and continuity is so poor, if it wasn't for the fact that the script is so weak, it could have been a good plot for a comedy.Unfortunately it fails on every level, I did laugh out loud at a couple of the absurd moments in the film but I probably wasn't meant to.What on earth were you thinking? You should not be making films, you should not be writing scripts and you certainly shouldn't be acting in them.I have experienced many paranormal events and seen many inexplicable things during my life. This film makes a complete mockery of a rather more serious subject and may actually push people away from wanting to find out the truth.Dong do it again, it is just a cynical exercise.",False
4,7,You get back what you give to this film.,quirkyname,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ok, I can see from other reviews that this documentary was a labor of love for many and tells a story that is clearly very important to its community. I totally respect that.I think that you get from it what you bring to it. It invites you to go along for a journey. It doesn't force anything on you, and you have to pay attention.If you like intentional, slow-burn stuff, especially the original Wicker Man with Christopher Lee, this is potentially up your alley. You can sit back and try to find the cracks in the facade and play the ""Wait, how much of this do they actually believe?"" game and still have a really good time with this film, but keeping your cynicism at bay for an hour or two gives the best experience.If you are tired of seeing the same old story/format over and over and over again, give this a try. It's rare to find something that is truly different and it's genuinely hard to categorize. Let this one in.",False
5,2,Doesn't make sense,madmaywebdesign,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe film was done well but the story is stupid, to say the least. They swung too big with their solution or ""history"" of the artifact and haunting. They landed on an ancient goddess that was trapped in the artifact. An artifact that had new nails and rope around, that they concluded, through investigatory research, was purchased at Walmart lol. Even in the original post with it's pictures from 2016 the rope was new, and even newer in the film. IF the artifact was really placed in a cave during a ritual, it would not have been for that purpose. They could have gone with a different story that was believable. I mean anything else could have fit that narrative better. My guess is they troll old forums and blogs for stories that were once viral and twist them into a ""documentary""... which again is totally fine, it's entertainment, but come up with better stories to back your tales. This one was just silly.",True
6,7,Review for the Unbinding,Reviews_of_the_Dead,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a documentary that I put on and treated like a podcast at work. The title sounded interesting. This was also listed on Letterboxd as one of the higher rated horror/documentaries that was on a streaming service that I had. This also being from 2023 intrigued me. That information was enough to check this out.We are following a married couple, Greg and Dana Newkirk. They grew up together where they were doing their own 'ghost hunting' and filming it. What was interesting there is that Greg grew up religious and then married a practicing witch. Something also interesting here is that I saw a handful of reviews online comparing them to Ed and Lorraine Warren. I can see that since they collect haunted items and also help people. To my knowledge, the Newkirks have fleeced people as of yet.Now that I've introduced them, the major part of this documentary is them coming into possession of a strange statue from the Catskill Mountains. They found the user on Reddit who was seeking them for him and his friend who took the item. They claimed that it was haunting them. The statue was then sent to the Newkirks, who then go about trying to find out what they can about its origins and what could be lingering about it.What I'll then say is that this is well-made. It kept my interest throughout to figure out what they would come up with. There are a few different methods that do seem to have scientific backing as well as ensuring that they're not influencing the results. Do I believe that this statue was haunted and causing disturbances? No, I do not. I do believe these people could have experienced things that they cannot explain. How this is constructed worked as well as it made me uncomfortable and I enjoyed that. It does feel like a longer and better production value than episodes of Ghost Hunter shows. I did find the couple we follow likeable. It was entertaining. I will say to watch this to make your own determination as to what you think is happening here.This was on Tubi, so you can watch it for free with ads.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.",False
7,1,Nothing but a commercial,Gud-er-gud,n/a,15/08/2025,"If it weren't for the fact that it is a blatant attempt to draw susceptible wanna believes to their other content, if it wasn't for the fact that the production value and continuity is so poor, if it wasn't for the fact that the script is so weak, it could have been a good plot for a comedy.Unfortunately it fails on every level, I did laugh out loud at a couple of the absurd moments in the film but I probably wasn't meant to.What on earth were you thinking?

8,7,Interesting and enjoyable,midnightantu,n/a,15/08/2025,"I enjoyed it. I was hesitant after reading the negative reviews, but I'm glad I watched it. In some ways, this is a typical ghost hunting ""documentary"" - meaning, of course there's no evidence. Some reviewers seemed surprised there's no irrefutable proof of ghosts here. There never is - there's no scientific peer reviewed journal about to publish a paper on ghosts. You can't prove gods or ghosts are real, that's the root of people's fascination, and kind of the whole point.What isn't typical about the Newkirks' approach is that they're not afraid to get into the weird complexities. I can't stand typical ghost hunting shows but this is much deeper. They dive into the psychological muck, take their time getting the emotional experience and tone right. They research everything and show how gooey myth and folklore are. It's cool to watch them piece together their research and experiences - no matter what I personally believe. Yea it's their cognitive bias but so is every single religious or supernatural experience. Regardless, I followed their logic. They touch on magic and the collective unconscious and tie it all together. They might have the goofy tools other ghost hunters have, but they use them in unique ways, and that's only the surface of what they do.Even if this is all staged, it's still a good story. It's impossible to say what they actually believe, so I can't speculate on their intentions, but it was cool to learn about a goddess I didn't know about before. And I really like what Strand said about how studying the paranormal is like studying yourself. It's true. I think they manage to touch on something ancient that is a key part of the human experience we don't often get to connect with.I didn't come out of this believing in ghosts or gods. What I got out of this was entertainment and I learned something new. And I did get a little spooked!",False
9,2,A bad Paranormal Activity sequel script wearing a Documentary costume,nosbig-29036,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you buy into the coveniently loose and ambigous field of paranormal ""investigation"", you'll probably love this. If you gobble up Zack Baggins' Ghost Adventures, if you think an arbitrarily asigned star sign dictates your personality, if you're the type to cliam you can sense negative energies/entities/spirits, this film is for you. If you possess an iota of skepticism or rationale; if you need your research to present even a single piece of reviewable evidence to inform it's conclusions, then don't waste your time - this is a script for a rejected Paranormal Activity sequel, masquerading as a documentary.I'm a skeptic (see: rational), so I *do* need my investigations to present some sort of evidence-based support for their conclusions, especially when those conclusions are that a wooden figure has been possessed by an ancient goddess that periodically materialises to cause minor inconveniences - the focus of this ""documentary"". This film has none.Our subjects in the film are a couple who call themselves ""paranormal investigators"" and own + operate a museum of paranormal items, with previous screen-time in other similar productions. So we're starting strong with our hard hitting investigation, with a primary source who clearly have no potential interest or gain to come from a ""documentary"" exploring their own experiences with ""the paranormal"". I mean its not like their entire livelihood relies on people believing these paranormal stories and being aware of them and their museum... oh wait.But ignoring that detail (as the raving 10/10 reviews from paranormal-believers have)... for the 90minutes it runs for, our subjects recount the timeline of various spooky events that unfolded after they took possession of a haunted ""Crone"" statue; this narration played over out-of-focus, slow-mo reenactments of the same events, starring our subjects as themselves. The harrowing events range from benign every day occurrences like a coffee spilling, or hearing the sound of running water, to the farcically outlandish such as monstorous wet footprints appearing on their couch, to a literal demon woman materialising in their bedroom and walking around. None of these accounts are presented with supporting evidence, only the dramatised reenactment where they go so far as to cast an extra to dress up as a goulish demon lady when needed. Or perhaps one of the subjects is playing dual-roles.Actually that isn't quite true, they showed a photograph of their couch with a wet print on it, so naturally the cliams are irrefutable now. I mean they have a picture of a wet spot on the couch!The reason that I compare this to Paranormal Acitiity is that the plot that unfolds is just as stuffed with contrivances and contradictions in service of the story, as any of the films in that series. The Crone's power level varies wildly on a whim, at times being able to physically manifest to destroy a crucifix, while at others only being able to myseriously tip over a drink in proximity to the Crone statue. The decision making of the subjects is nonsensical beyond the motivation of telling a spooky story - one such examples being when they take the Crone with them to a paranormal convention, bringing it out for show and tell, 30seconds after they say they decided tolock it up in a box on a shelf for good, for fear for its powers.I wouldn't mind this film if it was billed as a legitimate sequel/spin off/just another paranormal horror film. But the efforts made to frame it as a legitimate documentary, combined with the wave of narcissits that prioritise their need to be ""in the know"" above critical thinking rating this 10/10 (because of course this film is better than Schindlers List) bugged me enough to make an account just to post this review.",True
10,1,Terrible,exon-cheep,n/a,15/08/2025,"Don't waste your time. They obviously show no video or empirical evidence about anything that occurred in the documentary. You're better off watching the Fourth Kind with Milla Jovovich. That movie was better in every way.This documentary just goes on about a haunted item that someone finds online. They claim to have haunted experiences as soon as anyone comes into contact with said item. However, there is no evidence at all shown or given.In one example, they arrive at a public event with hundreds of people. They claim that several crazy things occurred as soon as they unveiled the object. You would think that someone would have at least a photo of anything that happened. But no, there is NOTHING shown.",False
11,1,Literally nothing happens,emmajawilkin,n/a,15/08/2025,"Apart from one slightly spooky moment involving a trail cam, nothing supernatural happens AT ALL. It's all feelings or atmospheres. Literally everything can be explained away too. There's a great long scene where the 'witch' is talking to the 'entity', but only she can hear it. We can't. They also make a tenuous link with a Slavic deity (although obviously the ghosts that inhabit it speak American) based on pretty much nothing. And at one point the irritating male ghost hunter says 'And then all hell broke loose' when they unwrap the 'crone' at a paranormal convention, but there's no footage of it. Not one person had a phone?All of the people are pretending to be experts but there's nothing here that a Google search wouldn't tell you. Don't waste your time on this rubbish.",False
12,7,Open up your mind,marylauracarter-60647,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Open up your mind and let everything come through."" 13th Floor ElevatorsOk. Maybe not a documentary in the true sense.But I think these folks, and many others, believe in the paranormal, spirits and spirituality. I mean, what is religion anyway?I thought the filming was done fairly well. No shaking of the camera. If it had been a Blair Witch attempt, I would not have spent 5 minutes on it.I also felt the cast did a good job of explaining what they were doing without hyperbolic emotions.Obviously, not everyone will like or care about this story, but, it's interesting for sure.Give it a try.",False
13,1,Definitely Not a Blair Witch Project,mariya_mirabella,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI actually did not expect it to be anywhere near as good as the Blair Witch, but kind of hoped it would be interesting and entertaining. Instead, it was a complete and utter rubbish. The main narrators, a couple of paranormal enthusiasts, come across as quite comical and I found it very hard to take them seriously; especially the new age wife who seem to believe she is an actual witch. There were some really interesting bits of the ""documentary"" that could have been played better and appear scary, but the lukewarm narrative and gormless ""serious"" delivery made it all seem trivial and boring.But what really pissed me off about this whole charade is the whole ""Ukrainian pagan goddess"" thing. It was silly beyond belief, completely idiotic - I have no idea what IQ one is expected to have for this story line to scare/ impress/ interest. And don't get me started on the ritual of hiking on a public path, staying somewhere 1hr away from the car park and removing ""cursed"" nails apparently bought in Walmart to ""unbind"" the ancient deity... The whole thing was comical and cringeworthy.",True

(Jinns love to manipulate Humans into thinking they are Gods and take your praise and energy as the ultimate sign you have turned away from your Creator).The people knew exactly what they were doing, made it out they were doing a good service of setting the entity free.This was a violent entity, it only became calm once it started to manipulate the group into freeing it from it's prison.Making out everything was fate and circumstantial in their narrative was for show.People do this on a daily basis, to gain favour from the Jinn.

15,2,Not A Documentary.,meddlecore,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is quite blatantly a scripted, fiction film, that is- for some reason- listed here as a ""documentary"".It's not.And is quite clear about that fact.That being said...the reasons for this become obvious when you learn who the filmmakers behind the project are: the husband and wife team of Greg and Dana Newkirk.A couple who run a museum and podcast dedicated to haunted objects, and stories about haunted objects.So...this is effectively just an elaborate marketing pitch, and call for you to send them your claimed to be haunted items for free...so they can put it in their museum, and make bank off it.Now...I do believe in haunted objects...I have a painting called ""Evil Man"", which has a demonic entity attached to it.So...I am by no means a skeptic.However...the story presented here- about an effigy found in the Catskills mountain, with nails driven into the eyes, that is said to be haunted a ""Crone"" type entity- is quite absurd.And backed by no evidence whatsoever...other than unfounded, unreliable, unreplicatable ""ghost hunting"" techniques that can easily be dismissed.As previously noted...when all is said and done, it's actually quite clear that the whole thing is scripted.They not only allude to this fact...but even poke fun at it.So, as a documentary...it has zero value.Though, as a mockumentary...you might argue it's cleverly done.That is...if you ignore that it's mainly a feature length commercial for themselves, and their museum.Acting as a desperate plea for you to send them your thought to be haunted objects.So it doesn't deserve anything more than a 2.5 out of 10.Which is being generous.",False

They talk up the Reddit groups and their YouTube and live streaming.The story had a chance but really went nowhere which is sad because I wanted a good scare. Ukrainian pantheon gods that according to the historian were just made up anyway kind of took away any of the legs the story may have had if it had continued how it started.I thought I was watching a student budget movie that went nowhere but it really is just not worth the watch.Also, why 3D print artifacts that you think are haunted ? Just seems weird to me.",False
17,1,"Pure, unfiltered, garbage.",khaoselement,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thought this was a mockumentary going into it. It isn't. These people actually believe that they harbored a Slavic god in the United States for three years. These trumped up cosplay conmen are trying to peddle this as a REAL EVENT!They hit all the classics. Big events that happen off camera, nonsense garbage they took photos of. My favorite is the women e.ohatically posing near their couch where they spilled some water and claiming it was the Slavic god that had stood there and made it wet. They never get any photos of the footprints or anything they claim exist though.At one point they say an entire convention center full of people was hit by this ""entity"". Lights flickering and some.man going into an intense seizure that caused him to bleed from his ears. No pictures or videos of any of that.

18,3,If the Dunning-Krugar Effect was a Film,purelake1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having grown up in the Hudson Valley, when I saw this was about a haunted item that was supposedly found in the Catskill mountains, I was instantly intrigued.Unfortunately, the Unbinding has very little to do with the Catskill mountains or upstate NY. It ends up being a mishmash of nonsense.The Unbinding is ... weird. I feel like these folks received their education from Google and have done no deeper research on anything, yet this is presented as a documentary. They speak with authority but are experts in nothing. The whole film feels like watching an unironic study of the Dunning-Krugar effect. The writing and dialogue is somehow both shallow and self-important.The film quality is surprisingly okay but the overuse of slow motion should be criminal.The ending made my head hurt...the conflation of witchcraft, tarot cards, crystals, and Ukrainian folklore is wild. The open fires in the woods? How did they not get arrested for this? I kept hoping the Crone was going to come to life and beat them all to death for their disrespect.

19,9,Multilayered and Moody,garcia-leila-d,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is not a horror film, nor can it be categorized as part of the typical paranormal reality tv genre, rather it is an investigation into a series of mysterious (and creepy) events surrounding a strange figurine, and the search for answers.The Newkirks' approach to this investigation is a deep dive into folklore, mythology, religion and witchcraft, combined with their insatiable curiosity, respect, and humor. The atmospheric cinematography, soundtrack, and audio mix draw the viewer into the Newkirk's world.Their investigation spans several years, and the film relies on recreations from time to time to illustrate the teams' personal experiences, but the look and feel - moody, dark and eerie - is consistent throughout.Watching this film leaves the viewer with a desire for more opportunities to travel into the Newkirks' world in search of answers - or at least insight - into the unexplainable.",False

The Unbinding is a very heartfelt documentary. When they received The Crone and it started manifesting itself at their apartment, they tried to come to an understanding with whatever was inhabiting this figurine. It didn't cooperate with them so they kept it sequestered until they could return it to the place of origin. They then performed a ritual to release the binding that had been placed on it by persons unknown. Once the ritual was complete there was a noticeable change in the figurine and then they repatriated the figurine to the mountain it was found on and removed from by the two hikers.

It's not often that you get to witness such an undeniable act of compassion and love, especially for something once thought to be ""scary.""Of course, this beautiful story is complemented to perfectly by Karl's keen eye.

Masterpiece is an understatement for this film; you will walk away looking at the world a little bit changed. Sometimes we take it for granted what our religions tell us to believe, and we don't question it; but if you're on any kind of spiritual quest, you're constantly challenging your beliefs and reaching new heights in your growth.

It opens so many doors for conversations to be had about the paranormal as a whole and maybe change a few minds from what they used to think or believe and maybe open their eyes to see that there's so much more! Greg and Dana give us just a small glimpse into the world that is the Newkirks and have graciously shared their experiences with us and given us the tools to look at everything paranormal through a new lense.

Proving that things are seldom as they seem and the Crone was no different. It takes patience and time to properly understand things.

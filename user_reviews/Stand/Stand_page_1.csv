1,9,A must-watch for African-American Youth,ingemar4949,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc is about Mahmoud Abdul Rauf; the Steph Curry of the 90's. How he came out of his poor circumstances with hard work & dedication, his struggle with Tourette syndrome and most importantly his battle with xenophobia and racism in the US. A very fitting name for this doc b/c he literally took a STAND against all this to protect what he believes in even though this would mean he would lose fame, lots of money and recognition. Glad that Joslyn Rose Lyons finally got his story out to shed light to another dark part of US history. Mahmoud not compromising his faith no matter the consequences is something we all can learn from in current political/social climate.",False
2,10,"Powerful, made a serious impact on me.",colwell-964-108423,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was born in Australia & in 1984 so never heard Mahmoud's story or what happened, but wow, what an impact he had. I really enjoyed the documentary, it told a great (but sad) story in a fantastic & entertaining way. It made you think, questioned your own past actions & it showed we've come further but we still have a long way to go. BLM. Mahmoud's story should be told, a lot & I'd like to see it included in education. It's a powerful message & will help educate people in acceptance of others.I also loved the old 90's basketball clips, growing up watching these guys, was very nostalgic. 10/10 for me. Really made an impact on me. I hope I can be a better person after watching this.",False
3,10,ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC SPORTS DOC,moneyjay-80871,n/a,16/08/2025,"@DocWatcher11111111
This was an excellent film. A true doc on a TRUE STORY! The production Entity MSN, who also did the LAST DANCE and their phenomenal production team, talented director, once again put out a great film. Every interview was ON POINT. It shows-they did a superior job telling this story. To your fake comment above about it being a ""PR Film"" you are mistaken, I know for a fact working here at CBS, that the network and director did not show this film to Rauf until the picture was locked... the director and team only received feedback from Rauf when on set. You sound mad bitter, seems awfully revealing that you raved about Quiet Storm. Hmmm. I think we all know who you are now.",False
4,10,Amazing documentary which inspired my children,xnjkmbrp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely amazing documentary which I watched with my children. My children were so inspired by watching this documentary and realised they could achieve so much. Highly recommend people watch this documentary as it will leave you so inspired. The documentary focuses on disability, racism and prejudices in todays society and the stuggle Mahmoud went through to break down such barriers. People will look back at inspirational people like Mahmoud who tried to make this world a better place for our future generation. I hope this documentary is shown on more channels and in schools to inspire all children.",False
5,1,Far from objective/stolen film?,DocWatcher11111111,n/a,16/08/2025,I was super excited to watch this film. Always found Rauf's story interesting and thought it should've been done at a network level a long time ago. But it's not a doc. It's a PR film. Just an awful film. The director and him have both done interviews where they say Rauf had final cut. Journalism isn't even attempted which with a story as important and complex as Rauf's makes this even more disappointing. Plus there's industry chatter that the project was possibly stolen from another filmmaker? The opening sequence with the TVs looks awful. Where are the interviews with any opposing point of view?,False
6,10,Showtime and NBA sell out again on Mahmoud Abdul Rauf,leemason11,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this amazing doco the day it came out in Australia, (which it didn't by the way, i switched PVN's etc to watch, no shame here) I followed Chris Jackson and Mahmoud throughout his career and still do to this day. He is an amazing sportsman but an even better man. This doco well directed by Joslyn Rose Lyons hit all the targets for a good doco or film, drama, humour, and tragedy, Mahmoud has been through his fair share of it. Would recommend it to any sports fan or anyone really, frustrating thing is, Showtime has taken it down for no apparent reason. NBA. Blackballed him again. Gutless.",False

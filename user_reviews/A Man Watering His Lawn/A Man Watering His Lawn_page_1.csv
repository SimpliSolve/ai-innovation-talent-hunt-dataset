1,9,Very slooooow,baconheart97,n/a,15/08/2025,"This review assumes the reader has not yet seen the film and is here to decide if it is worth their time. That is a fair question since this film more than most will only appeal to certain crowds, and most will be turned off by it. But, if you like this kind of fare you will love it. So let me ask you a few simple questions and then you will know for sure if it is right for you that way you can decide to watch it yourself. OK now let's get started. Does your favorite movie star Tom Hanks or Bradley Cooper, or anything in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Do you think Bradley Cooper is the best actor and director and deserves to win an Oscar? Do you watch the Oscars every year and cry when Bradley Cooper doesn't win? If you answered yes to any of the above I am sorry this is not the film for you. If you answered no, keep reading. Do you enjoy slow films, realist cinema, or works that take new and unfamiliar forms and actually makes you think instead of just spoon feeding you all the answers? Do you enjoy the works of Chris Marker, Jonas Mekas, and Chantal Akerman? Do you think Bradley Cooper's new film Maestro is just his latest ridiculous attempt to win an Oscar? If you answered yes then this is the film for you.",False

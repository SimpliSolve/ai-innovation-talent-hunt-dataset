1,6,Bro thinks he's funny because he's famous.,stevewrightrealty,n/a,15/08/2025,"My wife liked it. She's Latina and I'm white so maybe I don't understand it. I just don't get all the cheers without making me laugh even though the headline was something like unity in laughter. He was trying to either be uncancelled or prevent from being cancelled most of the time. He mentioned kevin hart as not giving power to the cancel culture but most of what Gabriel talked about was giving power to cancel culture. If they didn't have power he wouldn't have mentioned it. Dude had the best night of his life and it was like watching someone in the witness stand. He is a great sound artist and a story teller, I just think for the venue it would be more attack and less defense.",False
2,6,"Entertaining, but not Fluffy's best work",artgutierrez,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw Stadium Fluffy last night, and I simply enjoyed it... And that's not necessarily a great compliment. When I watch a Fluffy show, I know it will be nothing but big laughs the entire show. You're going to bust out laughing the whole show. So, if you merely just enjoyed it, then it's somewhat of a disappointment compared to his previous work.The venue itself (Dodger Stadium) was basically also a star of the show. So Gabiel needed great material that was worthy of the great venue. That material simply did not live up to it... at times. A lot of the show was hit or miss with the impact of the jokes.I did notice that more of Gabriel's stories were just that... Stories, not jokes. I expected more rapid fire jokes in his stories. But at times they were few and far between in Stadium Fluffy. I don't mind Gabriel telling us stories about his life. After all, that's what his stand-up material is based off. That's his bread and butter and he should stick to that formula. But all I ask is to be more consistent about the funny delivery of those stories.Good entertainment, but not Fluffy's best.",False
3,8,"SOMETHING DIFFERENT, BUT WONDERFUL!",yahyabajubeir-91036,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fluffy has been my number one for quite sometime now, even though im all about dark humour and fluffy doesn't really go down that road so much. So before watching this i told my friends that this show will make me decide if he's still my number 1...So after watching it (literally just finished it now),Drumrolls!ü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Åü•ÅI realised that this wasn't all about comedy..this was also about connecting with the legend (fluffy) himself, i feel like i know him more as a person now and i think we (fans) needed that. SO TO BE FAIR i wont use this special to rank his ability to make me laugh, I mean if i was told to rate this just by the jokes then I'd definitely give something lower than 8 because he's done so much better before. But to rate this as a whole!?...A solid 8.",False
4,n/a,Current events and politics ruin the show,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"People had enough of that and try to move on or simply doesn't want to hear that in a supposedly entertaining type of event.The other parts are also not really good. The almost two hours were not used well.Mostly longer stories that are kind of boring and lacking in the jokes apartment. It felt like self advertising and bragging.Too much focus on the event and not on delivering quality to the audience.He is not my favorite comedian but he has better specials than this.I believe the long hiatus ruined some (or most) standup performers. They became disconnected, out of touch with people.",False
5,6,"""I have never been distracted by a blimp with my face on it.""",classicsoncall,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't doubt Gabriel Iglesias when he stated near the end of his program that this was the greatest night of his life. I can't imagine any one single individual selling out Dodger Stadium for a one man show, but Fluffy did it and an overhead shot of the stadium confirmed it. But I didn't get the impression this was an evening of entertainment, but more a reflection on Gabriel's life and personal situations that got him to where he is today. As such, there was not a lot of humor in his delivery, even when riffing on subjects like the Covid-19 pandemic, waiting on line at Starbucks, Halloween with son Frankie, or his introduction to country music. This would have been informative in an interview format with a host asking questions and Gabriel answering; it almost felt like an interview without a host. And stretching the show out to two hours made it somewhat of a chore to sit through. More than once I thought that this wasn't funny, although I did persevere to the end. I do believe Gabriel Iglesias was honest in his reflections and truly humbled by the experience of performing in such a huge venue, and it may have been a Netflix special, but it wasn't really a comedy show.",True
6,9,More human with laughs,skphotos-81402,n/a,15/08/2025,"I get that people just want laughs but these last few years did a number on us all. It just shows that even comedians go through hard times and if they can come back and give us some good belly laughs then they did their job in this crappy time. Life has changed, what we laughed at years ago is now taboo and he still made me laugh so hard and even a little misty eyed because he is human like everyone else.People just need to watch this for him and know the comedians talk about what's going on in their life, and for the past few years it's been vivid, cancel couture and more.. take it for what it was, a man telling us his take of the past few years with a lot of good laughs.I enjoyed it and after the few years I had, needed this. THANK YOU FLUFFY!!!",False
7,7,Fluffy kills it,RedKidBytes,n/a,15/08/2025,"Known for his voice imitations and making fun of his mostly generic daily activities and lifestyle, Gabriel ""Fluffy"" Iglesias is listed as one of the top 40 comedians in 2018 by Hollywood Reporter.Gabriel's visceral narratives and vivid descriptions supported by the hilarious sound effects grab the audience into the story from the beginning and establish almost a one-on-one direct dialog with everyone at the individual level.Although a lot of the stand-up comedians choose divisive or touchy subjects for laughter material, Gabriel purposely avoids it which allows him to relate to a much wider audience.This Netflix special is a truly funny laughing matter yet it's delivered as it is told off the cuff. It starts slow and gets funnier by the minute. It is a very entertaining show.",False
8,8,How can you not love Fluffy.,Top_Dawg_Critic,n/a,15/08/2025,"How awesome would it have been to be there at this live show - selling out an entire stadium. If you're not laughing, you'll genuinely have a perma-smile throughout the almost two hour show. Gabriel is one of the best and most honest storytellers there is, and his style is top shelf. Some comments complained he touched on politics etc, but so what, for hardly ever doing so, it's a comedians encyclopedia of content, and he touched on those topics with style. Certainly one of the better recent stand-up shows out there, and 1000x better than the last one I saw - Trevor Noah live in Toronto, which was utter boredom and nonsense. Sure there could've been more comedy in the two hours, but his voice-overs in his story-telling are just as enjoyable and entertaining as laughing at a joke. Can't wait for another Fluffy show, and happy we finally met Martine! A well deserved 8/10 from me.",False
9,6,Enjoyable Special from Fluffy,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gabriel Iglesias, aka Fluffy, is a funny comedian with a positive disposition and this special is good. It is billed as the performance of his life because it was filmed in a football stadium in Los Angeles. That doesn't much change the content, aside from the fact that he talks personally about the experience and meaning for hi. He covers topics of the Pandemic, his weight, and his family. He is a very approachable and endearing person and I did enjoy listening to his stories about his comedic rise, as well as his perspectives on the world. It is refreshing that his is not overtly political, or controversial. He is funny, but he is not hysterical in my opinion. This was a good way to pass an evening for sure, even if it was not the best comedy special of the year.",False
10,10,"Incredible, loved it.",adrianristin,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI am really impressed with the special, i laughed, i had tears in my eyes, i simphatised with him and i think it is amazing that he had a special where he speaks of serious factors of his life too, as i said i have nothing but appreciation for this man even more now that he had the courage to go trough the topics he did. He loves his public the public loves him, that is clearly visible.Also love the nostalgia of the doughnut joke :)And the ending, absolutely special, after 25 years of doing comedy and all the experiences hes gathered, good and bad, he deserved it.I am a big fan of Gabriel Iglesias,Always there to brighten up our moods, we thank you.Huge round of applause üëè",True
11,8,"More slowed down than usual, Fluffy seems depressed.",Adam-09265,n/a,15/08/2025,"Don't get me wrong i like the man, i've enjoyed all of his stand-ups and specials. Although something seemed a little slowed down in this special. Fluffy seems to have been affected by either; Covid, Cancel Culture, Woke Stupidity and it seems to have depressed him a little. The biggest one being his breakup in his relationship.This special was pretty decent in areas and Fluffy seemed happy at the fact he was able to do specials after Covid. It's not been a nice few years for us all but i respect Fluffy for giving us the opportunity to witness his awesome jokes and stories, especially after what he's been through. The man is a legend.",False
12,3,Not his best,aliaouto,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFluffy used to be one of my favorite standup comics but in this time and age of the revolutionary era of standup he fails to deliver a good show. Standing on that stage and being afraid to be canceled was one of the obstacles that limited his potential. Most of the show was not even a funny stories. Its just a story. Most of those would fit on a youtube video but not in the biggest special you have ever done. Unfortunately, Iglesias still think that funny voices can be entertaining for 2 hours. But that was killed when he tried to poorly mimic all the characters from Space Jam which was far from how they sounded like. People never expect him to sound exactly like other characters but he put himself in that situation and he didnt deliver. A big portion of the special was Fluffy trying to show people how a good person or how big the event was.",True
13,4,Thought this was a comedy,icedtrucker,n/a,15/08/2025,"A two-hour trip down ""the dumps"" road. I stopped half-way to check if it was a comedy or documentary.I realized I hadn't laughed in a while.Finished watching it week or so later.It got worst.Dis-appointing. Maybe he's lost his touch?From his stories... maybe time for counselling?I would still recommend all his other stuff. The man can be very funny. Just not here. It's a shame too. I don't think he'll ever get a chance like this again.Too much personal emotional stories. With very few jokes. But he does explain why he's not so funny... He doesn't want to hurt anybody's' feelings.When he's is over his break-up I would expect better..",False
14,4,No Laughs,barrywomb,n/a,15/08/2025,"I prefer earlier Gabriel. His first special was absolutely hilarious. Other ones that he had were also pretty good, too. This one, unfortunately, didn't do anything for me. He cites Kevin Hart for doing a stadium show, so he wanted to try it. That's fair. However, Kevin Hart's stadium show was also not funny- comedy rarely translates to huge arenas. This was also pretty long- usually, that's a bonus, but the comedy just wasn't happening for me, so I was waiting for the end before it was the end. I notice that Martin is making lots of appearances in his videos now. Nobody is there to see him, not sure why he gets pulled out at shows.",False
15,2,Waited for the jokes,Proairguitarist,n/a,15/08/2025,"It took me several attempts to get through he special. I assumed there'd be jokes, but much like his other shows, he just tells stories that are mildly humorous if at all.I understand his fans have a cultural icon to connect with, but that's not enough to be called funny. If you want to laugh, check out Bill Burr, Mark Normand, Louis CK, or Joe List and I'll challenge you NOT to laugh.I realize comics tend to get personal but you still need to have content and punchlines. Then when he finally does tell a good joke (rarity) he milks the hell out of it to the point where it's no longer funny.Save yourself some time, it's just not a good show.",False
16,5,"not the best one, too long and too much preaching",caroline_schmid,n/a,15/08/2025,"I like Fluffy a lot. The old shows were something new, and he's still the best while imitating sounds and people. But this one, this newest show, is just too long, and while waiting for the puns I felt like getting a preachers speech about life and mislife crisis.The puns he made were funny, though. But it was 'too american' for my taste, with all the talk about cancel culture, vaccine and love your neighbour speeches. So I'll await the next Fluff round where I hope to find some new moves rather than the old safe tour in the latest part of comedy history. Tge show surely is good enough for a little laugh, but not wver as good as Ricky Gervais.",False
17,3,I've never seen shilling this hard (yet low-key enough),backup-50362,n/a,15/08/2025,"Okay... He is funny and likeable, but his brand of humor got progressively less interesting for me with each new special. It's always pandering to Mexican sensibilities, mixed with ""my son this and my son that"" (never anything good), mixed with ""united we stand!""You know, that fake thing every corporation does to sell stuff - pretending it's about unity. Fine, as long as he makes oblivious people happy - I was all for it.But now he's shilling so hard. The special literally starts with promoting his merch shop in your face, and he's LITERALLY WEARING a shirt from his merch shop, WITH HIS MERCH TOY FIGURE on his MERCH SHIRT... that he's wearing during the whole special.How hard are you trying to sell merch? This is Disney-Star Wars levels of ""thinking for merch before entertainment or anything else"". Jeez.And yeah, while I always found him reasonably likeable and inoffensive, the humor just doesn't do it for me anymore. He's a walking merch ad now... Pretty shameless too. ""Buy tickets and buy my merch for unity!"" - yeah... Great...""Blah blah blah --random Spanish word-- blah blah."" - This is the special otherwise. It covers the most outdated, overdone topics, such as COVID and vaccines. If I have to say anything nice about it, it's that he's very careful not to offend anyone, often making sure to point out that he's not attacking any group. And... that's nice, considerate and unusual for a Netflix comedian, but... The humor is just barely there.",False
18,2,Boring.,tkave,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerPlain boring and preachy m.As a Latino it's annoying as hell to watch these vultures trying really hard to earn the Hispanic audience, but it's cringe.Dude I get it your Mexican American.Not Mexican. Totally different.Speedy Gonzalez doesn't represent Mexicans.But back to his lame special.Dude even ripped off Dave Chapel by ging the ending to the joke before the story.I did not laugh. Dude is telling stories and tries to make them funny, but they are not. Read a comment below that said dudes wife is Latina and she was laughing but not him because he's whites and may not understand it. No. Fluffy is just not funny my dude.He's basically the new George Lopez. Almost a pushover. Afraid to talk about the real stuff so he talks about his life. The greats talks about what bothers them and make fun of it. This guy is just lame now.",True
19,5,The show was just too long...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Of course I am familiar with Gabriel Iglesias, and when I stumbled upon the 2022 stand-up comedy special ""Gabriel Iglesias: Stadium Fluffy Live from Los Angeles"" on Netflix, I opted to sit down and watch it.I have to say that he is rather full of himself and riding high on his success. A bit to the brink where it is starting to become cringeworthy to listen to. And it was shining through in his material during this 115 minute long show.And running at 115 minutes, I have to say that for a stand-up comedy special, it was a bit too long and too much. And certain parts of the show felt like mere fillers.Sure, Gabriel Iglesias feels at home on the stage and does have a good on-stage presence and charisma, and that helped to make it bearable to sit through 115 minutes. The material of his show was rather varied in contents, and that certainly also helped to make it possible to sit through the prolonged show. And I will say that there were some good and genuine laughs here and there throughout the show.Gabriel Iglesias is good at setting up the jokes and delivering the punchlines to his jokes.All in all a fair show, but nothing overly outstanding, unless you are a hardcore fan of Fluffy.My rating of ""Gabriel Iglesias: Stadium Fluffy Live from Los Angeles"" lands on a five out of ten stars.",False

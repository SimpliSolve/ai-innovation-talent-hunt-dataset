1,8,A fun ride!,stonkgoesup,n/a,16/08/2025,"Haters will hate, but ""Electric Money"" is a fun ride, especially the speculation around Peter Todd. If you want a history lesson, read a book. This was an exploration of human ingenuity, psychology, and survivalism. I watched it twice.Captured in a Vox-style presentation, ""Money Electric"" is a cinematic gem that delves into Bitcoin's enigma with both intrigue and insight. Director Cullen Hoback crafts more than just a hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto; it's an exploration of cryptocurrency's impact on society. With stunning visuals and a haunting soundtrack, the film captivates while making you ponder over themes of identity, privacy, and the future of finance. It's not just for crypto fans but for anyone intrigued by how technology reshapes our world. A compelling watch that leaves you questioning, engaging, and inspired.",False
2,6,Hmm double check info,galli_f,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was enjoying the conversation and found it interesting. However, at the end, you made a false statement or mistake that is easily verifiable, which makes it difficult for me to trust anything else that was said. Specifically, you mentioned that Argentina shut down their central bank, which is not true. If you missed that fact, it can be quickly verified with a Google search.So, fun to watch if you are in the space. Not too much credibility.Apart from that, how scary are the people who got involved on Bitcoin that early, and that's being polite.Now I do not have more words IMDb, come on.",False
3,10,"Entertaining bitcoin history, fascinating characters",davidryansnyder,n/a,16/08/2025,"Full of colorful characters, the documentary is an entertaining introduction to the world of bitcoin, and the mystery surrounding its anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.For those of us who are uninitiated, I think the film provides the needed context to understand the basic ideas behind bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and why it matters in a world dominated by fiat currency. It goes into some interesting history, such as the Blockchain Wars. It's fun to get a glimpse into the fascinating characters that inhabit the bitcoin world, from cypherpunks, to politicians and even a prince.The film closes on an investigation into the true identity of Satoshi. As a bitcoin outsider, I found the conclusion to be compelling and plausible. Among the bitcoin initiated, it is likely to be hotly debated.",False
4,10,Sort of blew me away,MGCalv,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't know much about Bitcoin before watching, but this documentary laid it all out in a way that was super easy to understand. They take something that can feel really complicated and break it down step by step, so even if you're not a tech expert, you'll get it. I loved how they didn't just talk about the tech but also how this could change the future of money for everyone. This is just the type of documentary that makes you think more about all the complexities of our society.Another thing I really liked was how they brought in different voices from all over the world - experts, bitcoin critics. It wasn't just one-sided, which made it feel balanced. The visuals and graphics were also on point, really helped break down the complex stuff in a fun way. My only critique is that a couple of parts got a bit too deep into the technical side. The block size nerd wars being one of those moments. But I guess it was an important thing within the overall narrative.I am not even going to mention the twist at the end to avoid spoilers, but boy did it give me chills. Loved all the forensic evidence, like in a mystery novel.So if you've ever been curious about Bitcoin or just where the world's headed with all these new digital tools, you've gotta check this out. Well worth a watch!",False
5,1,Wasted opportunity,lamichhane-ranjan,n/a,16/08/2025,"All the time, resources, and access this dude got could've been spent on making an actually useful documentary about Bitcoin. There's a lot of topic to uncover with it's potential to change the world for the better. But like most of the lazy journalists of modern times, this guy decided to make a documentary about speculation; and a speculation about something that is arguably useless piece of information. Who Satoshi Nakamoto is is irrelevant, but the technological advancement introduced by Bitcoin and the potential of it to impact efficiency in multiple levels of financial and economic instruments is definitely important. Make a documentary about that maybe rather than going on a pointless goose chase.",False
6,9,A new angle and interesting documentary about Cryptocurrency,gmercenne,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery"" dives deep into who Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, might be. This film sheds light on why understanding Nakamoto's identity is crucial to the future of cryptocurrency and the financial landscape.By exploring the theories and potential candidates behind the pseudonym, the documentary raises important questions about trust, decentralization, and the fundamental principles of cryptocurrencies. The filmmaker intertwines interviews with experts, and compelling narratives that keep viewers hooked.The documentary also emphasizes why cryptocurrency is not just a passing trend, but a transformative force in the financial world. With its potential to democratize finance and empower individuals, Bitcoin is presented as essential tools for the future. The film makes a strong case for why understanding the origins and motivations behind these digital currencies matters now more than ever.Overall, ""Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery"" is a must-watch for anyone interested in the future of money. It's both a riveting mystery and a thoughtful exploration of the revolutionary potential of cryptocurrency. This documentary will leave you questioning, informed, and excited about what lies ahead in the world of digital finance!",False
7,10,I want more!,shawnaschultz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Money Electric was a unique ride with even more unique characters. The bad ratings are from people who disagree with the conclusion of the film, in my opinion. I wish it were a series! Feels like there was so much more I wanted to learn about and people I wanted to follow. I really enjoyed how my opinion changed as I learned more clues, and I found myself wondering why some of these folks would even agree to be a part of this in the first place. I think they're all clever people, and they enjoy the game just as much as the audience enjoys watching them play it. I'd recommend the film, and tell you just to enjoy it.",False
8,10,A riveting and visually stunning deep dive into the world of Bitcoin,frendofafriend,n/a,16/08/2025,"HBO's latest documentary, Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery, is a captivating deep dive into the world of cryptocurrency, unraveling the complex history and mystique surrounding Bitcoin. Whether you're a seasoned crypto enthusiast or someone who's only heard the buzz, this documentary strikes the perfect balance between accessibility and depth.The storytelling is nothing short of riveting, exploring Bitcoin's origins, its volatile market fluctuations, and its potential to reshape global financial systems. The documentary doesn't shy away from difficult questions, addressing everything from the mysterious identity of Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, to the technology's ethical implications. Yet, it does so without feeling preachy or overly technical, keeping viewers engaged from start to finish.Visually, the film is stunning, blending sleek animations, expert interviews, and real-world footage to illustrate how Bitcoin has permeated every corner of finance and society. The pacing is spot-on, with each segment offering fresh insights, supported by interviews with key figures in the cryptocurrency space, including developers, financial experts, and even early adopters who mined Bitcoin when it was still an obscure curiosity.What sets Money Electric apart is its ability to present Bitcoin not just as a financial tool but as a cultural phenomenon that sparks debates about power, freedom, and the future of money. It's thought-provoking without being overwhelming, making it perfect for anyone curious about where money-and the world-might be headed.Overall, Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery is an enlightening, beautifully produced documentary that is as educational as it is entertaining. HBO and Cullen Hoback have once again delivered a must-watch that will leave audiences talking long after the credits roll.",False
9,10,Cullen Hoback has done it again with Money Electric,rich-95024,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cullen Hoback has done it again with Money Electric, delivering a documentary that breaks new ground in investigative journalism. His fearless, razor-sharp approach to exposing the hidden forces shaping our world is unlike anything anyone else is doing in the industry today. While many shy away from tackling the complex interplay between money, power, and corruption, Hoback dives in headfirst, peeling back layers of secrecy to reveal uncomfortable truths with clarity and precision.No one in the field is doing work quite like Hoback's. His documentaries stand out because they are more than just expos√©s-they are revelations. He takes audiences on a journey into the heart of the system, showing us how power operates behind closed doors and how it impacts all of our lives in profound ways.Hoback's ability to provoke action from his audience is rare in documentary filmmaking. After watching this film, I can't wait to see what Cullen Hoback does next.",False
10,10,I'll watch it again,kateryabtseva,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you don't know anything about Bitcoin, this documentary is a great gateway into its world. It's not very technical but you will understand the basics of blockchain technology and will get a good sense of its history, the community that surrounds it, its global influence, and the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. While not the punch line, the Bitcoin community is the biggest gem of this documentary. It's a collection of highly intelligent awkward people, scary fanatical groupies, and a bunch of charlatans.You get to learn about something really important and be amused all along. Very well done, worth a watch or two.",False
11,10,I recommend,natachkasol,n/a,16/08/2025,"I accidentally came across the name of this film, found it, watched it, and didn't regret it. This documentary opens your eyes and reveals the world of digital currency and blockchain technology. Before watching, I only had a vague idea of Bitcoin and mining, and I never imagined the scale and complexity of this global network. The film does an excellent job of explaining how the system functions and raises important questions about who really holds power in this decentralized financial world. It's fascinating to learn how a single digital currency can operate outside the traditional banking system, controlled not by governments but by a vast network of miners and investors around the world.The documentary makes the topic accessible even to those unfamiliar with technology, breaking down complex topics into smaller parts and explaining them in simple terms. It also explores the environmental and economic impact of Bitcoin, giving viewers a fuller picture of its role in the modern world. I came away with a better understanding of the intricacies of cryptocurrency and a deep curiosity about its future. Highly recommended for anyone interested in understanding the digital currency revolution, regardless of their technical background! I only wish the film had been longer, as I would be interested in seeing a more detailed version.",False
12,1,Bad journalism,jellekloth,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is clearly that the main focus of the docu is on the history of Bitcoin and sensational amusement. If you want to learn more about the mysterious inventor of Bitcoin you can better watch a random YouTube clip about the topic. And they have done a better research job with more compelling evidence. The conclusions are so absurd that the docu becomes slabstick.Go dive in the rabbit hole of Bitcoin, the working mechanism and in what way this technology can change te world for the better. I hope this documentary is a gateway to more serious information sources. There are also a few good podcasts about the Satochi podcast.",False
13,10,We are NOT all Satoshi,imdbfolic,n/a,16/08/2025,"Satoshi is someone who invented bitcoin and owns a pretty big chunk of its world supply. There are many people invested in bitcoin out there who seem to be at peace with Satoshi's anonymity, saying things like ""We are all Satoshi"" and ""No one knows who Satoshi is"". These mantras are repeated all over internet and it's pretty impossible to have any kind of constructive debate that doesn't end with either of those phrases.Clearly, Cullen Hoback and HBO are not the only ones insisting that uncovering Satoshi's identity is a worthwhile thing to do. Many journalists have suggested their theories. And why the hell not?! One individual owns a record amount of one of the world's top assets (because yeah, bitcoin is no longer just monopoly money for nerds, Bill Maher) so we absolutely should care about who this person is. We leave in the world where money is speech, where one rich person can buy a whole social media platform and affect markets, elections, send cars to space etc.The case proposed in the doc is new and unexpected. Although people have been talking about the possibility of **** being involved. But no one actually spent time and put all the evidence together, until now. Th evidence in the film and the additional facts that keep coming up are convincing. The more people watch the film, the more independent research is done, the more we'll know.Everyone should make their own conclusions, as long as they are willing to spend 100 min to watch this ground-breaking investigation.",False
14,1,It's Click Bait at Best,christopherrobinreynolds,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a poorly researched attempt at a headline, crafted like a lazy cash grab to anyone that is a part of the crypto community. The idea of ""revealing Satoshi"" sounds good on paper to any exec, it's hard to pitch without it, but that's not what was done here.Hal finney and or len sassaman very likely created Bitcoin and that is the greatest injustice here is that the truth is out there and this opportunity was wasted.The show is weak... no real investigation into Satoshi, more of a lightweight history of crypto from bitcoin's inception through eth and alts, CBDC and ... FTX.Interviewed participants: Adam Back, Peter Todd and Samson Mow, (the maximalists) and Nouriel Roubini.No Nick Szabo.No Craig Wright, just a sidenote.No real insight, just fluff.Elizabeth Warren and Jamie Damon as sideshows.The ending is embarrassing with the filmmaker confronting Todd upfront and literally ""accusing"" him of being Satoshi - while Todd is laughing.",True
15,3,Well produced but ultimately flawed.,darrenkis,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA well produced Bitcoin doc that digs a bit deeper into the history of digital currency and has some great interviews with interesting people.Unfortunately Cullen fell into the 'big block' trap and failed to understand the technical trade-offs of that strategy, which is why it ultimately failed.His outing of Peter Todd was planned from the inception of the doc but if he'd just checked his research with someone like Nullc he could have saved himself a lot of time and Peter the unwanted attention.It's a shame the couldn't make it a series as originally intended but it would probably have all been debunked halfway through so they decided to do a hot and run instead.",True
16,1,Nonsense,zhangyangxu,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't think the creative team has proper background in order to comprehend the topic. You need to know some basic algebra, probability, stats, combinatorial optimization, computer security, distributed systems, and ecomonics in order to put something together and deliver a convincing narrative. Obviously the team doesn't have the capability to do that. This ""documentary"" just some unsorted segment of sound and pictures of nonsense. As a software engineer, early adopter of bitcoin and filmmaker, I feel been insulted by the ignorance of the work. If the creative team could dive deeper into the topic, I believe they would pay more respect to the cypherpunk community. They are the smartest people I ever know. Some of them are winners of ACM, inventor of SSL, creator of off-the-record messaging. There are so many great people among them and they have done many great things that are changing the world, including bitcoin.A better documentary on this topic would start from a wider and Intellectual perspective.",False
17,10,How I hired Wizard Web Hacker to Recover My Stolen Bitcoin,HannaN-03,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hope this message may help someone out there. A few months ago, I stumbled upon a post about a cryptocurrency investment platform on facebook that I thought was a good idea at that time to invest in crypto, I didn't realize I was being catfished by the cryptocurrency investment manager who promised me huge returns on my investment. I lost my capital of $70,000 and interest without receiving any profits in return. I was depressed and had no idea how to move forward. I told my colleague at work about it and I was referred to Wizard Web Hacker, a cryptocurrency recovery company. I provided all the information about the scam to them, and they were able to recover my funds within 72 hours. I'm truly grateful for their help and I want to recommend their service to everyone affected by these cryptocurrency scams. You can reach out to them through the above information:WhatsApp: +1 812 542 7779

18,1,Lazy Journalism,brmacdonald-46199,n/a,16/08/2025,"This individual had every opportunity to conduct and complete a thorough investigation of the topic. Footage of himself ""attempting to harvest"" was so ridiculous. Anyone who knows anything about tech, knows that he had a fractional set up...with the footage he even showed...what software was he using? Why couldn't he show the monitor demonstrating his efforts? My quick thoughts: it was a gimmick. There was no respect given to what the point of Bitcoin is actually intended to be: individual sovereignty. There have been better efforts made by independent journalists on YT and other platforms. You have enough clickbait in your life without this doc. Don't waste your time.",False
19,3,Promised lots delivered little,philup1981,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really was a wasted opportunity here. I would like to think I've seen most crypto and financial documentaries, and ultimately no matter how flawed I come out with more knowledge than when it started. Here I did not feel that was the case.The premise, although not obvious at the beginning was to flush out satoshi. Even that ultimately failed, with a loose connections on a slightly new theory, that I do not think holds up in reality. So remove this and we are left with nothing new at all. They had access to so many people at the coal face and it was wasted. It only washed over the political future, changes and the need for new tech and tough decisions ahead faced by governments and financial institutions. So once again not new insights, predictions or knowledge gleaned.Very little on the future of crytpto only briefly touched on its competitors, new technology etc. All a bit meh really, and felt half researched and opportunistic.",False
20,5,I like some part of the logic the documentary explores...,harlekinrains,n/a,16/08/2025,"So if you invented BTC lets say there is a decent chance you wouldnt lose the keys.If you didnt die, what do you do with the keys?You hold them to potentially topple governments or high rollers, once they adopt it (the fear of one of the potential investors the filmmaker talks to).You make a conscious decision to burn access because you are an idealist. (Actually burning them on chain would be far less romantic, and give you bad media attention.. ;) )And the movie makes a pretty good case for that community having been idealism driven - having nothing in common with the craze that developed along side the fast doubling in worth over time sales world that developed around bitcoin analogues.So - if you believe Satoshi lives, and he didnt lose access to the keys, this is what you believe in, in some form.I also liked how they differentiated and explored the different crazes on a timelime as their central theme. I think they got the characterization of those down pretty well.The end was overzealous and you actually start to see the fear of ""what does it mean, if the world thinks I'm it"" building in the main culprit the journalist honed in on. :) That felt like a pretty gradual building up of ""what the eff I'm getting framed here"", and not so much a ""someone has found out my very personal secret"".Decent documentary with a horrible end (Dont put the fear of jebus into Crypto Nerds!)?El Salvador is in the black whop did doo! ;) (I may eat those words some day... ;) )",False

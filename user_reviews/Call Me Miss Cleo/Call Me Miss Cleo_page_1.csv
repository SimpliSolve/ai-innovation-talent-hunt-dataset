1,7,She was definitely,AlmaSoulAmor,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI rated this a 7 because I was engaged the entire time, but wished it had went deeper.Throughout this documentary I had many conflicting thoughts - oh! She's a talented playwright, actress, artist . . . NO wait, she's a conwoman! Aka psychopath with anti-social personality disorder, nooo wait! . . . She has Disassociative (multiple personality) identity disorder . . . No wait??? Shrug, idk, she's for sure a fallible and dynamic human being.I did enjoy the flow of this documentary. I liked learning about Miss Cleo's life. I do wonder how so little of her actual background could have been discovered by the documentarians. It stated that she had approximately eight adoptive siblings and adoptive parents, so how were none of them found? Although it did explain that even her birth certificate was extremely difficult to dig up.Perhaps they should've went into how most things were not digitized back then, thus much more difficult to find. Though I grew up in the 80s and 90s and I still find it surprising that so little facts were shared about her upbringing. Why did they not interview some of her former classmates from the all girls private school? The expert on Jamaica and the African Diaspora was integral.I really loved that her two romantic partners were interviewed near the end, as this was the highlight for me. Prop 8 was beyond reprehensible, and the fact that Miss Cleo fought for the community made me applaud her efforts.My only gripes are - Why didn't the documentary mention what type of cancer? I shouldn't have to google this after watching. And the suicide trigger warning at the beginning made me think that she killed herself, when the only mention I recall was that she first thought of it at age 7. Lastly, what did she do for work or money during the 15 years following the lawsuits? She claimed to not have made much money from the psychic scams, so I am curious about the work she did afterwards (this being a documentary and all.)Personally, I adored the contributions of Raven Symone to this! She was our voice, the voice of us infomercial viewers back in the day. I wouldn't have enjoyed this nearly as much without her delightful presence and commentary.",True
2,7,It's impossible to not get nostalgic watching the commercials,kevin_robbins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Call Me Miss Cleo (2022) is a documentary my wife and I watched on HBOMAX last night. The storyline follows the 1990s infomercial icon and what little information is available about her upbringing, rise up the psychic ranks, fall from grace and life through her final days.This documentary is cocreated by Celia Aniskovich (Surviving Jeffrey Epstein) and Jennifer Brea (Unrest) and contains perspectives from celebrities Raven-Symoné (That's So Raven) and Debra Wilson (MADtv).This series was fascinating from beginning to end. The Seattle art theatre interviews and background were insightful and her high school year book pictures were fun. It's impossible to not get nostalgic watching the commercials and hearing their background operations. However, while it was nice hearing her post life stories in interviews, it felt like they were a bunch of suckers still falling for her scams...though it made me smile that she found happiness. I do wish they were able to interview members of her immediate family or any children she may have had.Overall, this is an entertaining documentary that leaves you wanting more. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.",False
3,6,An Understanding of Her Is Not in the Cards,jcampbell-06364,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before the widespread use of the internet, there was something called 1-900 or 1-800 connections on the telephone for ""services"". In the 1990's, in the multitude of late-night infomercials was the Psychic Readers Network, a group of people hired to read Tarot cards in a system that charged in the neighborhood of $5/minute. The biggest name of this group of people was Miss Cleo. I really don't know if you are not aware of who this person was that you would be interested in this documentary, but it is interesting anyway for a handful of reasons. People from Seattle were perplexed to see this woman who claimed to be a Jamaican voodoo priestess since she seemed so familiar to them. Her life in Seattle is a good basis as to how to take this person as you see this story unfold. The irony of this is that she was used by the PRN to make millions for them while some poor souls poured their hearts out to her and others in a desperate need to find answers to their problems. The Florida people who owned PRN used her identity (?) to make their money while paying her and others very little. The ending of this movie really confused me as she bravely fought her own confusions and angst to find a happy resolution to the rest of her life. The problem was for me. . .what self image was being addressed? I found the whole thing to be ironically confusing, yet I could not stop watching this.",False
4,4,Starts off informative then falls apart,Rage2Wrath,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you were alive and aware in the 90s through the early 2000s you know who Miss Cleo is. A tv psychic that eventually was caught up in a lot of fraud charges. This documentary promised to delve in to her past let the viewer know who she really was. The problem is that it never really does that. It hints at what the truth is but never really lays it out. I assume because the movie makers don't actually know, which begs the question, why make an expose about a person you don't really know anything about? It does expose past fraud she was involved in like stealing money from a small theater group in Seattle and lying about cancer for sympathy. Then it goes on to detail how she became the face a billion dollar fraudulent psychic network that cheated countless people out of money they probably didn't have to waste on lies. The weird part is that towards the end of the documentary it seems to try and make you sympathize with her due to her activism in the gay community. I'm not saying she is Hitler but she is clearly a con artist that stole money from vulnerable people and was apparently not the least bit apologetic or willing to take responsibility for her actions. Not the kind of person someone should try to lionize in my opinion. Would have been much better if it has stuck to the premise. 4/10.",True
5,2,Quick and lazy documentary,layofthelastsurvivor,n/a,16/08/2025,"Parroting the other low reviews, really missed the mark. Almost no direction or attempt at trying to build any kind of interest. Just snagged the low hanging fruit.Hard focused on some weird tangents and glazed over the interesting parts. Just hopped over the actual crime and lawsuit bits in little spurts as fast as possible.The biggest thing is they really skipped over the people that got taken advantage of for the sake of trying to make you feel bad for her. If it was really that bad of a scam, they probably could have dug about and found at least a few victims to interview right?We get zero of the victims perspective (besides a few tiny secondhand stories) or how they felt. If there were so many documented complaints and you spoke with prosecution post trial and settlement, you probably could have gotten at least 1 or 2 to speak. Having someone who spent a lot of money/time on the hotline and how they view it today would have been an interesting counter view.This doc just has a very clear target audience. I'm just being honest. You might like this if your black, lgbtq, or both, but you also might feel like they hard pandered to that demographic as a way to make a lazy documentary off of a nostalgic figure.There's for sure a super interesting story here about that industry and Cleo's personal story intermingled. It's a really interesting cultural phenomenon. Unfortunately, all this doc amounts to is a ""We love Miss Cleo"" party.Plus, the editing is poo.",False
6,1,Don't Waste Your Time,katiekat641,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is just awful. Incredibly biased on Ms. Cleo's behalf. The woman was a scam artist but this film tries to make you feel sorry for her, while offering up no proof at all. Just drones on and on about meaningless things that have no real connection to the subject matter. Just another blatantly biased documentary that was cobbled together to revise history and push an agenda. Most of the people interviewed have little to no actual connection to Ms. Cleo. The ones who do are biased and there are no conflicting or contrasting views presented. Also, Raven-Symoné is absolutely intolerable in this. Why is she in it in the first place?",False
7,10,Put it on for background noise and was sobbing by the end,sarahbuhlman,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had no intention of being actually engaged with this but was sobbing by the end. Miss Cleo was just some hack from 90s infomercials right? Who knows, but she was also a human with a life and a soul and trauma with people who loved and cared about her. I can just hope that people in my life look back on my mistake sworn as much grace and forgiveness as the people that love her looked back on her.It also just gives me some mad nostalgia for waking up in the middle of the night on the couch seeing her and being so curious and having idea what is happening and it feels like some weird closure to at least a part of my childhood.Whatevs, watch it if you have a soul.",False
8,2,Lazy documentary,Cima123,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not a very well made documentary. A good number of the people being interviewed have no personal connection with miss cleo. Nobody in the documentary knows anything about her background/childhood, everyone is just speculating. This film then takes a turn towards the end when it just beings to pander to certain audiences and prolongs useless scenes. This movie is filled with a bunch of useless filler scenes and celebrity commentary that brought absolutely nothing to the documentary. Terrible documentary, no one interviewed knows anything about Cleo. Just random white people saying their her family, but yet they have no idea where she's from.",False
9,n/a,A letdown,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't have HBO so I actually caught this over the weekend on Lifetime after the new Miss Cleo movie. No judgment please. I foolishly assumed that this documentary would provide real insight in the true Cleo or Youree, but I was sadly mistaken. Particularly since I'd heard that the documentary was not kind to her.I thought it was quite telling that the theater folks she scammed in Seattle got less airtime than those she clearly was still lying to in Florida. For me, this documentary would have had more credibility and balance had it been equal time to both groups with the goal of allowing the audience to see ""something"" was off. It also didn't seem like the glowing interviewees were challenged in any way. I don't mean badgering, but did they even ask ANY of them about the accent? If you are open and honest, that should have been the easiest thing for her to answer. I really liked how the Seattle group straight up said she did not have an accent. But then the Florida group clearly acted like none of that was part of the scam. It was so bizarre. Like come on, her daughters absolutely would know that the accent wasn't real and yet the documentary makers don't seem to make any effort to find someone during that period after PRN that wasn't falling for it. (I do not fault her kids for not participating btw). The Florida group seemed to be in some sort of codependent situation with her. All of them. Otherwise what explains being lied to to your face?Even with the footage of her, because of the lies, scams, and never admitting it maybe gave her some sort of green light to keep going? How can anything she uttered not be given skepticism?This leaves more questions than answers. I was ten years old when those ads started airing and thankfully my sibling and I and our cousins never called bc we all would have been grounded for life after the first phone bill. But I will say, it always seemed like a comical put on. Even at my young age and I do remember the comedy sketches and everyone walking around saying ""call me now."" I guess there is a certain kind of person that gets taken in by this but it just never seemed real. I didn't realize she died until Lifetime began advertising the movie so that was a shock. But I was surprised that she still tried to join another ""psychic"" network and she gave $100 readings. That means she learned nothing, yes? Why doesn't this documentary mention that part of her life?Also including Raven and Debra Wilson was weird and offered absolutely nothing. Raven was obviously learning about Miss Cleo as she was interviewed and I really don't see the benefit of interviewing someone who was a child at the time, whose only connection was doing a parody. And Debra was clearly trying to be a philosopher while never acknowledging that it was all lies. They both made so many excuses for her.Lastly, can we address the multiple elephants in the room? After the court case segment is over, the documentary switches completely to the interviewees that did nothing but make more excuses. It was honestly both pathetic and sad because in spite of their claims, if someone is using a fake accent and leaning into what's been exposed as a scam, you don't know the real them.I don't know what I expected of this film honestly. I expected more Miss Cleo but I thought it would be more of an in-her-own-words piece. I expect that when she was alive, there was a fine line she couldn't cross lest she incriminate herself but this was still a less than satisfactory viewing.",True
10,4,Bland and superficial,thirtysecondsovertokyo,n/a,16/08/2025,"While not completely awful, this documentary isn't particularly engaging and drags for most of its 90 minutes. Most of the interview subjects add nothing, and even the people who knew Miss Cleo don't offer anything particularly insightful. But perhaps the main problem is that she wasn't a very interesting person. And it seems a bit odd that this doc lets her off so easy for scamming both a theater company before she took on the phony Jamaican identity (she was born in Los Angeles) and of course, all of the people who called into the psychic hotline. At best, she's a footnote -- and worse, she doesn't seem to have any bit of self-reflection or remorse for all of the desperate people who lost money calling into that silly hotline.",False
11,10,Capital Theft at It's Finest,pdxqraj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Engaging documentary regarding an iconic Black woman that was skewered in the public arena. Heartbreaking to hear of her humble, tumultuous beginning that inconclusively led to her poor handling of affairs later in Seattle and beyond. The Miss Cleo commercials couldn't be avoided in the 1990s and early aughts, as she was an engaging being. Fallout from the scheming duo that devised the Miss Cleo brand seem to have buried the person, while leaving the business moguls unscathed. Miss Cleo, her patrons and the company employees were all used and mistreated. Glad to see that this documentary illuminates this cautionary tale for anyone with a tremendous, personal talent that can be abused.",False
12,8,Great Documentary. Call Me Now!!,imvaughn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this documentary. I remember Miss Cleo from my childhood but didn't know much of her story. It was interesting learning about the lawsuit and hearing from her friends. It seems like she was a really kind soul who wanted to help people.I'm happy that she was able to find happiness, laughter, and love after all she's gone through in her life. I'm still not sure if she's a real psychic but I lean towards yes.. people think being a psychic means you know 100% of the future. I don't think it does. But I do think she had a gift.I'm happy to hear she didn't live her final days out destitute and alone. But surrounded by loved ones full of happiness.R. I. P Miss Cleo.",False

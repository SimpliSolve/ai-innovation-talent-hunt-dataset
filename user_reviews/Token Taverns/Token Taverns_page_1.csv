1,7,Fun doc that gamers will truly appreciate,baccaruda1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I grew up in arcades. Lived for them, actually. I learned how to drive stick shift on a drag racing game, mastered the patterns of Space Invaders to become a local gaming legend (and I made quite a bit of $$ as a competitive player), and I remember going to Chicagofest, where there were literally acres of pinball machines to play between concerts. So yeah, I am thrilled that genuine arcades have made a big come-back. This doc highlights the folks who own arcade bars, and the people who love the games and the cool aura of these places. It's a niche that's growing like crazy and it's a social outlet that gets people together for fun and camaraderie. My wife Lorrisa is a principal motion capture actor in the Mortal Kombat video games, as well as DC's Injustice games. So I remain connected to the industry through passion and marriage. For those who enjoy this entertainment niche, Token Taverns is a must-see!",False
2,10,Truly an emotional journey,jasondiorio,n/a,16/08/2025,"More than just the nostalgia and the games I love, there was more connection and substance than you usually get from a nerd culture documentary like this (IMHO, as a period owner of things like ""Get Lamp"" and ""BBS: The Documentary). They also managed to give perspective on the impacts of challenging times without getting invested in political arguments, rather it was clearly about the people, their passions, and the ups and downs of their journeys. I was on that train and invested, smiling broadly and actually getting emotional at times. Bravo to everyone who worked hard to make this happen and congratulations to all those entrepreneurs. Vector, you are missed! I may be biased, but I thought it was one of the most engaging and real documentaries I've seen.",False

It's about friendship and community and people coming together and BEING together in a deep, poignant way.This is well made, with funny, compelling characters and locations that take you back to your childhood. Well, that's what it did for me, anyway.The movie flew by and I found myself totally engrossed in the storytelling and the characters. There's one of these throwback arcades about 20 miles from us and now I feel compelled to go there. And I'm def in the mood for beer. Ha ha.",False

12,10,A Trip Down Memory Lane!,bydzvrmsm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bob and his team did an amazing job with this documentary. The fact that he shot this during the pandemic made it extra special, especially since many businesses were having extreme difficulty trying to stay profitable after everything was good to re-open. The characters that are in this movie (and there are certainly some characters), add a legitimacy to the idea that these establishments were created with the sole intent to please their patrons and bask in the enjoyment of everything geeky. If you have even the slightest interest about the impact these arcades have on the local community, do not hesitate to watch Token Taverns.",False

16,9,Proud to be a Gen-X Pinhead,eaborn-05541,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was fortunate enough to see the big screen debut of ""Token Taverns"" this past weekend in St. Petersburg, FL.

It is fantastic that these venues are on-the-rise because they really do provide a place to meet with friends, make new friends and just have some old-school fun. ""Token Taverns"" genuinely conveys the magic that can be found in these awesome businesses and also helps to provide a deep appreciation for the entrepreneurs who give so much of themselves to provide these incredible spaces for us all.

17,10,For the love of the game...,jasonspriggs,n/a,16/08/2025,"In his third feature documentary Writer/Director Bob Rose and his producing partner, wife Margie Rose, take us on a journey of entrepreneurial innovation, nostalgia and the human spirit.If all you know of video games is your iPhone, or X-Box and Playstation on your big screen at home, the filmmakers of TOKEN TAVERNS bring us up to speed on the cultural phenomenon and far more social landscape of the console arcade video video game obsession from the 1980s. The film documents a cast of, now grown up gamers, who never let go of that passion. Now, with far more than a few quarters in their pocket, these entrepreneurs distill the culture of bars and video arcades into a new pastime for communities across the country. Build it and clearly they will come.With a few cameos from video game celebrities of the day, the storyline boldly adapts its production narrative to the real world of the Covid global shut down and pivots its story to address the personal stakes of several of these business owners trying to make ends meet in a fiscal wasteland of business ownership during a global pandemic. As the subjects of the film innovatively bob and weave to survive the pandemic, Rose expertly tacs narratively to feature this storyline rather than put the production on hold until the crisis would resolve.The result is an informative, exciting and emotional journey of several families doing everything they can to save their dreams. For the love of the game.",False

19,8,Interesting look at gaming,alecybarra,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is a unique and interesting look at a little-known niche: gaming and taverns. It is not only a look at the ""day in the life"", but it goes a lot further to explain the time period of how it all unfolded, especially during Covid. One of the interviews captured it well: ""Arcades are a new meeting ground for people. It's something that brings people together"". On a deeper level, this is really a film about how social connection and finding one's clique can happen in the context of everyday life. You don't need to go to some special, hard to find place. As these arcades within taverns become more widespread, it will be easier for people to be connected and happy.",False
20,9,How an Arcade Community Rose Up Against a Pandemic,robertworkman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rose does an excellent job providing a human face to these businesses, as the owners look like someone that could easily live right next door to you. They relate with business expenses and new ideas, and even show emotion when something unexpected happens (like Stormy Daniels popping through the door - honestly, she'd probably be fun to play X-Men with).That's part of the appeal - realizing that these guys are part of the community instead of just pandering down to it. Token Taverns shows this side in just the right ways, from selecting games for the bar (you have to have the Godzilla pinball, come on) and design to how they react to their customers. They're happy to be here, and doing everything they can for their beloved communities.I think Token Taverns is well worth a watch if you're in the mood of a story of triumph. These guys went through a world of hell with everything the pandemic threw at them, and the journey is well worth watching. Plus you get an idea of what makes a ""barcade"" tick, so this is worth the research if that's what you're in the market for. (Anyone want to partner up?)",False

25,9,"""Token Taverns"" is a captivating documentary",fredunderland,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Token Taverns"" is a captivating documentary that takes a nostalgic journey back to the 1980s, a time when local video arcades were the epicenters of social life. As someone who spent their formative years in these gaming havens, watching this documentary was a delightful trip down memory lane. However I must premise this with the fact that this documentary was produced in 2020 and does spend a great deal of time discussing the pandemic which is not as interesting as the topic of video arcades themselves.The documentary not only resonates with those who lived through the arcade culture but also offers a compelling viewing experience for anyone interested in the social fabric of the 1980s. The interviews are engaging, providing firsthand accounts that enrich the narrative. The camera work is skillful, capturing the essence of the arcade experience, and the editing is seamlessly executed. I only wish more time was spent on the social impacts the video arcades had in the 1980s and less time on how the pandemic of 2020 impacted today's retro arcades.",False

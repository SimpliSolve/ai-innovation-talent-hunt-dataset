1,6,120+ Years of Unjust Policy,SinkAndDrown,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary highlights the history and ongoing repercussions of cultural genocide, overreaching and assimilation the Canadian federal government has subjected First Nation children.It's a very emotional and powerful documentary that takes examples of abused individuals and showcases communities trying to heal from generational trauma.It's unfortunate the film focuses on some seemingly random interviewees, instead of leaning more on the history, statistics, political struggles and legislative ideologies. Or on why culture and community are the institutions that provide healing. Maybe it's my thirst for facts, but I would have like more interviews with institutional leaders, lawyers, historians, preferably native ones. I missed a more tightly defined narrative.Nonetheless, I think it's a powerful viewing and my eyes did not stay dry.",False

2,10,i love this film,AliceK-91,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI love this so much i find the climbers all so inspiring especially janja because janja is the best.Its great to have a documentary about climbing because when I've watched all the world cups available it's good to have something else to watchI wish they would have made another one before Paris and then another for la and just in general we need more climbing films!!Great also to see Shauna who was at the end of her career and brooke who was at the start of her career.It says i need to add more characters so I'm just saying how i love this a lot and everyone should watch it to see janja.I wish you could buy a blu ray tho.,True

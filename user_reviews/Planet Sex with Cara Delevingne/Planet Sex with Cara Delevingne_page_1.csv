1,5,It's a Documentary for 2022,Tactrix,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is everything you'd expect in a documentary about the sexual subjects that have been historically considered taboo. And Cara at the center of it diving in and experiencing and learning about why these subjects have been labelled as such and how to overcome that stigma in some very interesting forms.When it comes to this type of show the 2 elements I always look for are first is the show itself interesting? And second is it educational? To me the first part not so much, the second part a little. However I personally have spent a great deal of time researching these subjects for decades before this show was even conceptualized. So the real question becomes would this show appeal to you? For the vast majority, it would definitely be educational, and for a much smaller but still large group of people it would be quite entertaining so yea, for a good group people it would be good.5/10 for me, I'm thinking more like 7/10 for everyone else. For informational purposes it's a good documentary.",False
2,1,Jell-O,frukuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've only watched the first episode -- the one on the ""orgasm gap"" -- and didn't feel it was worth persevering with this series.While I appreciate I'm not part of the target demographic, I'm dubious that this will go down well with those who really should lap it up (teenagers, presumably).Cara Delevingne seems remarkably prudish to be cast in the lead here. And this first episode felt incredibly unstructured and unfocussed. Even someone like Stacey Dooley would probably have done a better job. And perhaps Zara McDermott would have been the best choice, given her experience in documentary film making?",False
3,10,Probably should be required viewing,Drabble500,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great series and very important. It lifts the lid on a stack of taboos and probably should be required viewing.Cara is great fun so that even the parts which might make you blush are navigated with ease. I like the way Cara is so relaxed and unassuming in her presentation.It's very much a documentary of the age. Unthinkable 30, 20, even 10 years ago. Not just the dive into the subject matter but the way it's shot. In terms of the production it's one for the insta generation but in terms of content, it's for everyone.As an educational tool? Brilliant.If you're one of those ""anti-woke"" types still give this a go. It will help you learn and understand.",False
4,1,Mind destroying boredom that will devastate your enjoyment of the rest of your day,oxylepy,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHulu suggested that this was a show for me and while initially it sounded like it could be cool I almost immediately lost interest in Cara Delevingne's asinine attempt to figure out her sexuality when she pretty much had the right idea in the begining, no labels. Going right into the show it felt like she was in an interview she didnt want to be in, and then she had so many hangups about her prior relationships you could see the distain when she learned that her brain lit up for love when looking at a photo of her ex.Walking into a show like Real Sex you want to be guided on the adventure by the person who can't wait to strip off their clothes and talk to the elderly polyamorous nudist colony, instead it feels like there's more hangups going into segments than a Health inspector bring introduced to buttered grubs.You want someone who takes you on a journey of human sexuality to feel like they're actually a person and leave you feeling satisfied after this romp through human sexuality, not leave you feeling like they can be summed up by eyebrows and angrily defying expectations because they're so edgy, hating the actor more than you hated their character in Only Murderers in the Building.I'd recommend this show to anyone who wants to experience violent boredom first hand, otherwise just go watch old episodes of Real Sex, it's a substantially more enjoyable show than this wayward successor.",True
5,10,"Refreshing doc series with humour, heart and...head.",30dayfreetrial,n/a,16/08/2025,"Look. Salt N Papa tried getting people to talk about sex baby. But that hasn't happened much in a healthy, accessible way. Til now.Planet Sex is one of the most illuminating programmes to cover gender and sexuality for mainstream audiences. It's a fun ride around the world - genuinely enlightening with a good mix of personal stories and digestible science. (But yes, if you're conducting academic research for publication in Nature, then maybe BBC Three or Hulu shouldn't be your first port of call.)The episodes are crisply edited and Cara D. Is a charismatic guide who connects easily with the experts and individuals from various communities/cultures. The curiosity and openness with her own experiences - at times disarming, even heartrending - add an unexpected, emotional depth to this very human series that explores the ever-evolving matter of gender and talks about sex.",False
6,1,Cara riding on coattails of a community she has done nothing for to rebrand herself,yelenamna,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't take her seriously after all the cracked out behavior and sleeping around with everyone in town including Jonny Drop's ex monster. I expect to take advice from sane human beings, who are a pilar in a community, are mentally healthy, respect themselves and others, not a cra(khead who sleeps around with married people, in and out of rehabs and can't behave in public. She should spend a few years building schools for the needy, wells with fresh water or something else to show for and redeem herself. Riding on a coattail of lgbtq+ community, while she never did one thing or used her popularity to fight their battles is disgusting. Now that she got cancelled, she feels she can use the community to gain popularity. Please sit down. Nobody cares about what you have to say.",False
7,10,"Insightful, positive and well overdue",annsummers-10684,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series is hugely important. It covers topics which lack honest, sex positive mainstream coverage such as female pleasure/orgasms, ethical porn/the issues caused by mainstream stereotypical porn, sexuality, gender, relationships etc. Her honesty is refreshing, although it's sad to hear about the deep rooted shame Cara has regarding sex and sexuality. She seems naive in some ways but given her life it's not really surprising - you can see that she pushes herself out of her comfort zone making this series. Cara only briefly discusses her sexual experiences with men but it's depressing - it's shocking to me, as someone who has always been confident communicating about sex and my needs - and just shows how much these conversations need to be had. I think this should be mandatory viewing for teenagers.If you're already aware of sex positivity, ethical porn and diversity then it's nothing groundbreaking but the fact that these topics are receiving mainstream attention in such an insightful, positive way is huge.",False
8,10,"Revealing, Insightful and Liberating",palmana,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't begin to express how this documentary is important and should be seen by everyone in this world! I'm truly thankful!I identified myself with so many insightful and sensitive explanations and real life experiences about a simple but complex subject!Fortunately I had a very open minded sexual education, but that's not the majority of the ""mindsets"" we find nowadays (even in first world Europe).Hopefully we are heading to a more open and freeing society in most conservative countries.Hopefully we'll rediscover true and liberating values so future generations don't get bullied or frustrated every time they look themselves on a mirror!For example, I read Kodo Nishimura's autobiography and it was so deeply revealing, sensitive and elevated that I was amazed how he managed to bravely overcome every challenge and struggle in his life! I was undoubtedly inspired!",False
9,10,"Should be shown in schools, very good information, all in great taste!",lapratho,n/a,16/08/2025,"So along comes Cara Delevingne and BOOM makes a splash on Hulu with ""Planet Sex"".She blazes a new trail in a really daring venture, that is sure to help out a lot of people. She presents everything in good taste, and shows a very human and sensitive face in her explorations of different aspects of sexuality and cultures and societies of the world. Cara does show different countries and their problems, like the Arab part of the world, as well as different solutions and research in places that are enlightened, like interviews with people, who fled for their lives to Germany, and the important work being done in some German research institutes.The importance of a program like this cannot be under-estimated, because we have a lot of ignorance and hate around sexuality, gender identity, relationships, personal identity, and pleasure in this world. I really think this should be shown to all kids about to pass into puberty, regardless of what screaming prudes may say!This series is fantastically informative, and is just a delight to watch, and it may well be for sex, what Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" and its remake by Neil deGrasse Tyson became for astronomy!In previous decades (a long time ago!), we had Dr. Ruth (Dr. Karola Ruth Westheimer), who talked about sex very openly, but I have not seen her, or anything like her on TV in a LONG time now.I tried Playboy-TV some years ago, but it was lousy, with lousy wannabe ""celebrity"" moderators and porn that was so bad, it was plain boring and embarrassing to watch.""Planet Sex"" is certainly nothing like Playboy-TV at all. It is serious, is not porn in the least, and presents information in a very classy way.Regarding bad critiques, just stuff them! I did read a few nasty comments about ""Planet Sex"" being boring, and there are oodles of haters of Cara Delevingne, simply because she was born into money. I am not bored at all, because my nerdy brain gets tickled by the presentations of stuff, some of which is new to me as well, like the internal production of cannabinoids during an orgasm, which is a major reason why sex feels good!So hop on Hulu, or wherever this may be streaming in your country, and watch ""Planet Sex"". Maybe you can learn something.",False
10,8,Cara is authentic and shines for this role!,laceydelrae,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm so happy I came across this series on Hulu . I am a lesbian and I also happen to find Cara is gorgeous! Okay that aside, I had no idea what to expect of this show. I do not follow Cara's career closely or her personal life. Right before I started watching the show I googled what kind of person is Cara. I read a little bit about her but I feel like she really brings her heart and quirky personality to this series. I feel like I have a good idea what kind of person she is now from watching her truly open up and be herself while hosting this series. She is emotional throughout and uncomfortable a lot of times. She doesn't hold anything back.I'm only on episode 2 so I'm writing my review before having seen all the episodes. Based on what I've seen from the first episode, I would say that this series seems to cater more to women who like women. However this show does an excellent job exploring differences of gender vs sexual orientation. It also delves into a lot of experimental science around orgasms, monogamy, and sexual identity. It's interesting and I'm enjoying it. I love that they chose Cara to lead ans the show is also an exploration for her to explore her queer identity and confront deep feelings of shame that have long surrounded her sexuality. So many of us LGBTQ+ people carry the same shame she described, myself included, so I could really relate with her on that.",False
11,10,"An Inspired Series on Love, Sex, and Sexual Expression",nancylynnmorgan,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is rare to find the depth and consciousness Cara Delevingne devotes to exploring the vast range of material brought to light in Planet Sex. If for no reason other than that this series merits attention, but there is so much more.The openness with which those interviewed respond to Delevingne's questions, and Delevingne's own genuine presence, result in a synergy that enhances each episode. The episodes are interesting, informative, touching, tender, inspiring, at times infuriating and always courageous.It takes courage to be open, honest, and present. Each episode revealed the burdens placed upon anyone striving to be open, honest, and present. It's really all any of us want but struggle to find given the systematized external constraints that shame, punish, and seek to destroy those qualities tied to our essential humanity.Planet Sex may be an investigation into areas of human sexual behavior, sexual orientation and gender identity but the series also sheds light on the shadow side of forces inhibiting behavior, orientation, identity, and sexual expression.",False

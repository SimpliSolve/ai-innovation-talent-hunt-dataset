1,5,Maybe Too Experimental for Me,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival""The Tuba Thieves"" is a film about from 2011 to 2013, tubas were stolen from Los Angeles high schools. This is not a story about thieves or missing tubas. Instead, it asks what it means to listen. The film consist mainly dialogue from subtitles as many of the characters were communicating done from sign language which was an interesting way on communicating the film.However, I didn't really know what the film really wants to be. There are good aspects of camerawork, production, and normal interactions between the participants. But I am not really sure what was the impact of the story trying to be and what the film is wanting to be. I feel like this film is too experimental for me.Good camerawork but I wouldn't see it again quickly.Rating: C+",False

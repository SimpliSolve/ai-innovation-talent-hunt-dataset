1,10,Moving documentary about the effects of isis abuse on young child,susannahbrackenbury,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this documentary some time ago and it really stuck with me. So much so that I looked for it recently
which was tricky without remembering the title or film maker. I was very relieved to find it again, as I wish to recommend it to family and friends. I have rarely seen a documentary that has had such a profound and lasting effect.The way the filming calmly shows the devastating effects of the abuse of ISIS on this mother and her children is incredibly moving. Without voice over the documentary shows how with a great deal of time, love and patience Imad is able to get past his violent past and slowly reconnect with his family and environment.The unobtrusive, observant, compassionate style of this documentary gets under ones skin.Highly recommended!",False

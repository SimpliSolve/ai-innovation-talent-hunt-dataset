1,4,"Informative, but disappointing fake IMAX",mixdown,n/a,15/08/2025,"Surely an extreme difficult movie in the making. Absolutely recommended, story wise.On the IMAX screen at the science museum in London, the film is presented digital in 3D. Technically extreme disappointing due to the fact, that most of the scenes are 2K resolution which is seen immediately at the beginning, a few scenes in 4K. It is pointless and fairly understandable why this is a IMAX labeled movie. And in addition to that, not even one 3-D scene is shot in 3-D, it is all, most badly, done in post production.This is simply not working on these large screens. This does not come even close, to the far superior 1570 genuine IMAX format.",False

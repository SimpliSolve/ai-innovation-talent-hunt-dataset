1,8,It's lovely to hear them both talk about Wham!,silverlve,n/a,16/08/2025,"After a long day at work I needed something to watch and this came up since I had added it to my list.It was nice to listen to George and Andrew go through the beginning of their friendship to the inspiration and growth of their music careers. You could see the ache Yog had for becoming that artist he always wished to be. These two young men had such an incredible experience and near the end when you could feel George becoming the solo star he was meant to be, it became a bit heartbreaking but you could see that was necessary. George was a powerhouse and yet he began a quiet, gentle soul. Made me teary at the end but truly enjoyed it.",False
2,8,Joyful memories of a snapshot in time,TeddyKeaton,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had a smile on my face as I watched most of this film, remembering how lovely George and Andy were together and the infectious smiles on the both of them. Their music is still as catchy as ever, and it was nice to see a lot of early concert footage of the group that I'd never seen before. Thank you Mr. Ridgeley for putting this together. My only complaint was that it was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be, and it could've had more clips of Andy and George in the studio together. Definitely a must-see if you're a fan of 80s pop music, and if you know little to nothing about the underpinnings of George's meteoric rise to solo career fame.",False
3,7,A love letter to Yog.,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"Did I need a Wham! Documentary in my life? I didn't think do, but turns out I was wrong. Now let's be clear I wasn't a Wham! Fan. I did grow up in the 80s, but I don't think there's a single Wham! Song I like. So why on earth am I watching this? Well partly the power of Netflix marketing and partly that I do enjoy a good documentary. And this is a good documentary. It doesn't break any moulds, the format of tons of archive is fairly standard now, but there is a wealth of stuff here that takes you right back to the era with nailed on authenticity. Two high school mates, fooling around with music, playing, experimenting. Nothing much else to do and plenty of social discord to feed off, as they muck around with home demos. What's obvious though is they've got talent and drive and in George (or Yog), a great charismatic singer. 'Wham Rap' still leaves me cold, but hey at least there was some substance to it and in 'Careless Whisper', although it's pure schmaltz, it's pop potential really does smack you in the face. What's interesting now, watching in 2023 is the reliance they had on the record industry to be given a break. No social media or accessible DIY scene. Young George and Andrew aren't work shy, putting in the hours on dingy club tours, but it's a lucky break getting the chance to fill in for a no show on Top of the Pops and from there things go nuts. It's all about the look. It's the 80s after all. Pretty boys (plus the two girls) and a dance routine what more do you need? Nothing apparently. The hits keep coming, charting every single. There's no talking heads and most of the narration comes from Andrew Ridgley, stock filling in where the archive gets sparse, but there's plenty from George Micheal too, these parts beautifully edited to make it feel like he's been part of the production with the two friends still bouncing off one another. No more so, than when the subject of George's sexuality comes out. How he handled it or rather didn't. His realisation that he was gay, at a time where that was still an issue in a Conservative British society. Instead of being excepted as it would be today (in music at least), it's repressed and hidden. Overshadowed by the critical punches they took as their pop star rose. Screaming teenagers taking over as they go on tour, they play up to it, leaving by what I'm sure are the front doors of Manchester Apollo (58:50) in towel robes, when they could've snuck out the side door. It's the era of Whamania and they admittedly love it, sticking their faces on merch... and making sod all money. It's details like this that make documentaries on subjects you didn't think you cared about interesting. Because you don't know everything and often because you've not paid attention and dismissed something, you've not realised there's more meat on the bone. So we wind through the sordid issues or dodgy record deals, the band creative separation, ambition and two people on different paths. Ridgley talks openly and candidly, as much of the story becomes commanded by George. It's to Ridgley's credit that he drives this so well. It's a love letter to a lost friend. Am I a converted Wham! Fan? No, not at all, but I'll admit more respect for George Micheal and Andrew Ridgley, what they did and how they did it.",False
4,10,This is a feel good doc!,blemmel19,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat a refreshing look into the genesis and the rise and denouement of Wham! As George Michael's star is rising.I laughed and sang and truly elevated my vibe. This wasn't a Behind the Music sort of expos√© with dirt and infighting and backstabbing. No True Hollywood Story drama.Hate to spoil it, but two really nice guys start writing songs together, then they put music to it, do some original dance moves, market themselves cleverly and voila! Big success that translates internationally.I will continue to spoil it. Andrew Ridgeley very humbly and presciently could tell George had far surpassed his own songwriting abilities, and sends him off in the most gentle and supportive way. I will watch this again and again to have a little pick me up.",True
5,10,Beautiful tribute to such a wonderful band,iamshotty,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you to the creators of this documentary and Netflix. In a nutshell, it was so well put together, with George and Andrew telling their story in its raw form - no pretence, no fluff, just the facts. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and then laugh again. It made this fifty-five year old woman re-live her youth. I cried at Careless whisper and Last Christmas, I laughed and danced around the lounge room to Wake Me Up Before You Go Go, trying to re-do the moves of a teenager, with creaking knees and hip joints, until it hurt. It was so worth it. I LOVED IT. For those of you who there back in the 80s and fell in love with the boys from Wham as I did, you will not be disappointed.",False
6,7,A Genuine Friendship Couldn't Overshadow George Michael's Dominant Shadow,EUyeshima,n/a,16/08/2025,"There isn't anything particularly revelatory about this 2023 documentary about the definitive '80's pop duo, but it's a mostly effective retelling of their successful albeit brief track record on the top of the charts. What appears reassuring was the genuine friendship depicted between George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley. And how George's mercurial talent as a songwriter and performer quickly broke the pair apart professionally. If there were ugly moments between them, you won't find evidence of them here. Director Chris Smith took a more vanilla approach and used audio-only interviews with George and Andrew to narrate most of the story. Since George died tragically in 2016, Smith apparently didn't want to lean too much on a present-day Ridgeley to have the final word on their story. The still-catchy music speaks for itself.",False
7,8,Really Fun Blast from the Past,HerHolyMoly,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was born in 1976 and grew up with Wham! Being a staple of the music on the radio as a kid. It was 'dare you to not dance and sing' amazing. I remember being 8 and belting out careless whisper so much that my mom begged me to stop and I did once my voice ran out. One day during a bath, I got my big toe stuck in the bathtub faucet. I was not paying attention as I was too focused on nailing the chorus down. The Wham!bulance and fire department had to come and free me from a very naked embarrassing situation. My mom did drain the tub and throw me a towel to cover up in. True story.We all know how George Michael advanced after his 4 short years in Wham! We know his trials and tribulations and the heartbreaking end of his story.But who really knows the story of how it all began?This is a brilliant documentary as you hear this wonderful story of 2 best friends since pre-puberty follow their dreams and create something truly magical. It's a fun ride, with lots of opportunities to sing along, and yet the entire time I was waiting for the other shoe to drop.We ALL KNOW how hard that shoe drops when George is on his own.Baby spoiler- it never happens.These documentarians stayed laser focused on their formative years all the way up to the final tour. Then fin. It was so cool to see a documentary in todays times in which we crave off the negative, just spoon feed us the positive, even when we can still read between the lines.I recommend this doc if you are a fan of their music. Even if you just LIKE it, this flick will remind you that you've been lying to yourself all these years, and you love them as much as the rest of us. Assimilate.",False
8,6,Not even the slightest hint of criticism or negativity,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Wham!"" (2023 release from the UK; 92 min) opens, we hear George (in archival audio footage) and Andrew (from new interviews) talk about how they met in school at age 12. In 1979, at age 16 they formed a pre-Wham band called the Executive. Then come the 1981 demos of Wham Rap and Careless Whisper, leading to a record deal in 1982 as Wham! Officially starts... At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from longtime documentary director Chris Smith (100 Foot Wave""). Here he, with the full cooperation of Andrew. Ridgeley and the estate of George Michael, looks back at the fast rise of ultimate 80's band Wham! I must admit that I am not the greatest fan of their music, which is a little too bubbly for my liking, At the same time, one must acknowledge that these talented lads were a mere 19 in 1982 when Wham ! Started, and a mere 23 when Wham! Disbanded in 1986. That absolutely blows the mind. (It also puts into perspective that George Michel's creative peak came when he was a mere 24 (with 1987's Faith) and 27 (with 1990's. Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1.) If we can believe this documentary, it was all roses and sunshine between Ridgley and Michael, from start to finish, and beyond. Is that really so? It's impossible to ascertain from this documentary. In fact there isn't the slightest hint of criticism or negativity throughout the documentary. In that sense, this movie feels more like tribute to Wham! Than it is a critical assessment. I would have preferred a bit more of the latter. The music, aside from several all-time classics like ""Careless Whisper"" and ""Last Christmas"", hasn't aged all that well in these past 40 years but even that cannot be discussed in this documentary.""Wham!"" started streaming on Netflix about 2 weeks ago, and I caught up with it just the other night. I typically enjoy these types of music documentaries, but not so much in this particular case. For that the documentary lacks any sign of critical assessment. Of course don't take my words for it, so check it out and draw your own conclusion.",False
9,10,"Outstanding, and moving.",spartanbuff,n/a,16/08/2025,"This new Netflix documentary on Wham! Is just outstanding.I had entered my classical music/opera stage so they were at the fringes of my awareness at the time. I had no idea they were as big as they were.It deals with the deep friendship of George and Andrew, and their mutual goal of creating their act. Their friendship endured, and with no strife or clashing egos. In fact both of them were sweet young men. Clean cut.I have to really give Andrew credit: he stuck by George after he told his best friend he was gay. Andrew propped George up, assuaged his insecurities and led the two firmly forward. And when it was obvious that George was the musical genius and would branch out solo, Andrew not only did not get in his way, he encouraged it; George was plainly headed for bigger things.When the last concert took place in 1986, the duo finished in triumph. Their pledge of friendship and gratitude for each other is quite moving.",False
10,7,"A nice watch, but missing the most interesting aspect",rklemm05,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been touched by the friendship between those two. Also by the level of sophistication of their music and producing.They were so much more than a fun ""boys band"", the glitter was just an added bonus to their real and undeniable musical skills.But sadly enough, there's nothing in this movie about their writing and composition process. Nothing about the core of their work.Nothing about how these 2 boys (and especially George) became so good at writing impeccable, catchy but yet complex songs that withstood the test of time.We never even see them playing an instrument (except for the semi-fake guitar acts by Andrew in the videos and on stage).This documentary conveys the impact they had on the 80's musical landscape and is touching in many regards, but as a musician myself, I would have loved a more behind-the-curtain approach. How did they learn music? How did they develop that ear for smashing hits? In a nutshell, their songwriting process as I said before.",False
11,10,Wham! is a blast from the past and a tribute to friendship,ergo-58534,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWham! Is a Netflix documentary that tells the amazing story of George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley, the British pop duo that conquered the world in the 1980s with their catchy and upbeat songs. The film is directed by Chris Smith, who has a knack for making entertaining and insightful documentaries about cultural phenomena.The film is based on archival footage, interviews, and personal materials from both Michael and Ridgeley, who share their memories of their childhood, their rise to fame, their creative process, and their decision to end Wham! At the peak of their popularity. The film also features appearances from other pop icons of the era, such as Bananarama, Bono, David Bowie, Boy George, and Elton John.Wham! Is not only a nostalgic trip down memory lane, but also a touching tribute to the friendship between Michael and Ridgeley, who remained close until Michael's death in 2016. The film shows how they supported each other through the highs and lows of their career, and how they balanced their different personalities and ambitions. The film also reveals some surprising facts about Wham!, such as their groundbreaking concert in China in 1985, and their involvement in social causes such as Live Aid and Band Aid.Wham! Is a must-watch for fans of Wham! And George Michael, but also for anyone who enjoys a good music documentary. The film is full of humor, emotion, and energy, and it will make you want to dance and sing along to Wham!'s timeless hits. Wham! Is a 10 star film that celebrates the power of music and friendship.",True
12,6,Music & Lyrics,TheFearmakers,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's easy to understand why George Michael never came out of the closet during his heyday, which extends to the Faith/Sex solo album and however long his sex symbol status made him a star (I was at the Elton Johnson/Eric Clapton concert when he surprisingly walked out to sing Don't Let The Sun, and boy the women loved him, and these were older women: I've never heard women scream that loud in my life, it was really something else, and at this point, even part of pop music history)...But going back, in the beginning of his big success with WHAM, he needed to seem like he was a dream boyfriend to all the screaming girls, which were the biggest aspect of their fan-base... Coming out as gay or for that matter, even being engaged to a woman ruins the business plan of being someone any girl fan can possibly acquire...And it was nobody's business what George's sexuality was during the prime of WHAM or during his initial so success... It was HIS OWN business... Only nowadays does sexuality have to come before talent... It wasn't that way before... But even here he seems to have to apologize for keeping himself a secret (and had he NOT kept his private life secret, god knows the media would have killed him earlier than they ultimately did)...The sad part of this otherwise pretty good, You Tube style documentary is that poor Andrew Ridgeley, always known as the other guy, was really just that... He seemed to play guitar but most of the guitars on the albums were from session players... and the two girls were really the background singers...Other than Careless Whisper, Andrew didn't write any of the hit songs like Michael, who was also the producer... It's sad, really, but then again, this documentary does show that it was Andrew who brought George out of his shell... If it weren't for Andrew perhaps there would be no George at all...Some have been asking for a part 2 about George Michael's huge solo career, which was even bigger than WHAM for a while (before he burned out way too soon), but to me, learning more about Andrew Ridgeley would be far more interesting...Although, with that, perhaps just watch the Hugh Grant movie Music & Lyrics, which was obviously influenced by that other guy.",False
13,5,"Decent documentary, but seems to short-change Andrew Ridgeley",OldMovieRob,n/a,16/08/2025,"Caught this on Netflix recently and enjoyed seeing some of the background of the formation of Wham, and really enjoyed learning more about the friendship that George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley had from their school days, all the way up to the formation of Wham. The documentary goes into plenty of detail of their early club performance days all the way to larger tier events like Live Aid and shows how George pretty much outgrew the band and eventually would strike out on his own. The film gave plenty of focus to George and his sexuality, as to be expected from Netflix, but I feel this did a disservice to Andrew Ridgeley, as all I really took away was that he was a party animal whose antics landed him on pages of British tabloids, yet the documentary really makes very little mention of what he did after Wham (and unless I missed it, made no mention at all regarding his brief foray into Formula Three motor racing.) Ultimately it's a decent brief documentary of one of my favorite bands from the 1980's, but I do feel that it could have gone further, particularly with Andrew's background.",False
14,10,Finally,gibbonsmarlene,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had been waiting years for a WHAM movie and this
did not disappoint. A documentary that focused on the friendship behind the music. Comprised of chronological footage of Andrew and George's rise to success, narrated in their own words. It was very nostalgic to hear all the tracks that I grew up listening to and still resonate forty years later. It was also heartwarming to see how much one can accomplish when surrounded by a great support system. Too often biopics focus on the scandals and ultimate downfall of those who enter the music industry. This film honored the memory of George Michael and the legacy that WHAM's music left behind.",False
15,9,Brought a tear to my eye,jesse-846-720503,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never reviewed a documentary before. But this one really moved me.I had no idea of the backstory of George and Andrew's friendship. And admittedly, I had always thought of Wham as ""George and that other guy"". So it was great to see just how important Andrew was to them even becoming a group. The friendship portrayed here is truly amazing. What it must have been like to be in Andrew's shoes, seeing his best friend develop and grow into a huge worldwide phenomenon, while he gracefully stepped back.Lots of music and concert clips and some cool behind the scenes information on how some of the songs came about. George Michael really was a phenomenal talent. Such a sad ending for him.",False
16,6,Didn't love it,superfox_888,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although I enjoyed the trip down memory lane, there's something not quite right about this doco. In terms of cohesive narrative, the middle is out of place with things that should have been in the beginning, such as the friendship between George and Andrew, as well as George's dad revealing his controlling, domineering personality. As it is framed, George says he was afraid to come out to his father, yet the reason why isn't revealed until later, and narratively speaking, it doesn't make sense where it is placed.Picky, picky.Ultimately, this is a production that George (RIP) would be proud of. It's a story from before I was old enough to understand, a tale of determination and a sprinkling of luck.I hope in future we can see Part 2 of George's stellar career.",False
17,9,Wham!! We are the fan,yusufpiskin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pop band formed in England by George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley.And a Netflix documentary about this group.As Turkey's biggest George Michael collector, this documentary contains records that I have never heard of before, and details that I have not seen.This; The story of two misfits, who are not even alike, changing the history of music...
This; A window into George Michael's personality...
This; An impressive store of information about the entire world music industry over the England of the period.This; A depiction of how volatile, forgetful the 80s were, despite not having the social media of today.With pieces such as Careless Whisper and wham rap that George Michael wrote when he was only 16 years old, he proved what a great music person he was 43 years ago.It is a very nice feeling to watch the unknowns of this great musician's adolescence period, but it is also a bit sad.Here is the story of a lonely man in the crowd.In England, because he comes from a Greek family...
Because he has to do things he doesn't want in the music industry he loves so much ...
Because he is a gay teenager who has to hide himself among the people he loves...Long story short Wham! The documentary is a very important Netflix project not only for the fans of George Michael, but also because it portrays the period.",False
18,6,It has its moments,Kingslaay,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was very excited when this documentary came out on Netflix. Wham has been one of my favourite bands growing up and I have always been a fan of George Michael. So it was nice to get more of an insight into the other half of Wham, Andrew Ridgley and how the pair met and the early days of Wham. I was somewhat underwhelmed by the production. It felt rushed. It was good seeing the early years of George and Andrew, how they bonded and their paths to success. But I felt the doco focused a lot on the early years and rushed through the end. We only saw brief moments of some of the highlights some of us are familiar with. The doco glossed over Band Aid, Last Christmas, some of their biggest hits and could have spent more time on the dynamic of the pair. One of the sad realities of this doco is we never get to have a first hand account from George Michael. If only this doco was made years earlier, it might have been a slam dunk and changed the narrative and how it was told by the pair instead of solely relying archived footage which while useful, only captures glimpses in time.",False
19,8,Boys Will Be Boys...,Xstal,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's a decade that began with lots of style, if you were there I'd guarantee you had a smile, as New Romantics left a mark, Punk and Disco had a spark, but it was Wham that got you dancing in the aisle. Two bad boys who generated so much fun, they were the epitome of everyone's young gun, a ray of sunshine, panorama, cocktails abound at Tropicana, as they opened doors to everyone's freedom.A more than enjoyable reflection of a time two young lads came together to create some pop perfection, to wake up a generation and give those tuned in, everything they wanted, getting closer to a heaven, than they'd ever been before.",False
20,7,A Story of Friendship,atleverton,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a biographical film about the band wham! But really it's about the relationship between two friends who go through some things together that are really hard to imagine. I like how it undertakes to examine the creation of the band, it worked in the early days and how it fell apart. I like how the subject is taken seriously, but not reverently. I also like the fact that while George Michael would continue to be a pop culture phenomenon, this film is really not about the entirety of his life - just about his time in the band. So it's a pleasant watch for a music fan or a fan of pop culture.",False
21,8,Andy & Yog's Magical Adventure,xroo-73772,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are hardly any talking heads in this documentary. Even the old Andrew Ridgeley can only be heard, but is never seen. The story is basically told with archive footage. And what a great story this is, a bit like the Mozart fantasy in Amadeus (1984), but this time in real.Two teenagers, who behave like stupid teenagers and are considered to be idiots by many experts from the music press, turn out a string of catchy songs that are still - 40 years later - well known and liked. They authentically embodied the youthful energy, genius and lust for life that's at the heart of pop music. When they ended the Wham!-project in 1986 with their final concert, nearly exactly 4 years after the release of their first - and unsuccessful - single in June 1982, the best reason given was that they considered themselves no longer to be adolescents. A rare realization.Andrew Ridgeley was the moving spirit of Wham!, the energy. George Michael - nicknamed ""Yog"" by Andrew - was the genius. He became more and more obsessed with writing and producing songs, obsessed with the number 1 spot in the charts. He created most of the music, but turned a bit into a megalomaniac. During his solo career he wrote immortal songs like ... I don't know, actually. Aside from from the first post-Wham! Album, Faith (1987), he only released four more, from 1990 to 2004, with fine, but unremarkable music.The Wham!-Story is unique, fabulous, magical. Does this documentary reveal the whole truth about this seemingly impossible success? Probably not. But it does a good enough job offering plausible explanations. It should satisfy most of its viewers.",False

George Michael was so insanely talented it physically pains me that we can't get more songs like Careless Whisper, and the bond this doc depicts- gosh you can only hope to one day meet a friend as amazing and supportive as Andrew Ridgeley.This story gave me a whole different perspective on the journey of becoming a music artist back then. You can only imagine how different the course of their lives would be if they had never gotten their shot.The songs wham put out throughout the course of just a few years has made them 80s pop legends and hearing about how it all started is incredible.This film also introduced me to all the wham songs id been sleeping on like Wham Rap!, Bad Boys, & The Edge of Heaven. Since watching this doc, my playlist has doubled! Not from just wham's music, but similar songs molded from that iconic 80s sound.I enjoyed this alot and it had a bigger impression on me than i initially expected.",False

May have sold a lot records way back when but they don't have much of a story to tell. The story of Wham! Isn't much different than the story of other pop groups. The movie ""Wham!"" drags out their story for an hour and a half. There used to be a show on VH1 called ""Behind the Music"". ""Behind the Music"" could have told the story of Wham!

Even greater considering the secret both had to keep - at least George confined into his band brother and general brother from another mother.Maybe if you're a super fan you knew much of what the documentary is about. I had a lot to discover - and hearing archive interviews of the two band members (and of course many other people) makes this more than interesting.

25,6,I was wanting to watch a documentary about an 80s pop group and then Wham! there this was.,Pjtaylor-96-138044,n/a,16/08/2025,"'Wham! (2023)' is a documentary detailing the formation, success and disbanding of its eponymous band. It tells its tale by overlaying narration from Andrew Ridgeley and George Michael atop a variety of archive footage and still photography. There's rarely a voice that isn't one of the two stars, with only a couple of to-camera archive interviews being peppered throughout the piece, and this leads to an intimate and seemingly candid experience far more concerned with Wham!'s own perception of itself than with the way Wham! Was ever received by the public. It isn't clear if Ridgeley's voice has been recorded specifically for this film, but Michael's is obviously comprised of various interviews he gave prior to his death in 2016. As such, it's impossible to know if he has been taken out of context to better craft this documentary's intended stance. However, the picture generally feels honest and the two stars almost always corroborate each other's view on events. The construction of Michael's input also feels mostly seamless (aside from the occasional odd audio cut) and makes use of candid interviews clearly given after he'd been able to reflect on his career and become much wiser - or, perhaps, more self-aware - than he ever was while a part of Wham! (simply, it seems, by virtue of being older). The documentary does feel as though it, much like most people, focuses on Michael more than Ridgeley, but at the same time it makes sure to communicate the fact that without Ridgeley there would be no Wham! Or, even, George Michael (as the world knows him). It puts its blinders on, blocking out everything other than Wham!, and as such it actually feels as though it misses out some key components of at least one of its subjects' careers. It sets up a lot of things that it never actually resolves, building to an ending that could almost be considered a cliffhanger if it weren't for a rushed text ending that aims to bring you up to speed on the events that followed the film's chosen stopping point. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if a sequel was soon released which looks at Micheal's solo career. On the one hand, it's natural for it only to concern itself with the events which occurred during the lifespan of its eponymous band; on the other, it's bizarre for it to allude to certain things - such as Michael's struggle with being in the closet - without actually taking the time to explore them properly (principally because the events that could be used as a lens to draw those arcs to a close occurred after Wham! Was over). Despite its flaws, though, it's a well-constructed and mostly enjoyable documentary that aptly conveys the genuine friendship at its core. It isn't an especially deep or, even, exhaustive insight into its subjects or their body of work, but it's a fun bit of light entertainment that ought to have fans of the pop duo dancing in their seats.",False

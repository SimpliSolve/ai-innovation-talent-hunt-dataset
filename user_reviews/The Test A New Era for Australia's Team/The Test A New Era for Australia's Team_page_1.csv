1,10,Excellent Mate - Review by an Indian.,rithviikd,n/a,17/08/2025,"What an absolute treat to watch, stunning visuals. As an Indian the BCCI or any other cricket board doesn't have the courage to show the insides of the cricket game like cricket Australia did. Raw emotions and attitudes of players inside from the dressing room captured in a beautiful way.",False
2,9,This is PURE GOLD for Cricket lovers!,pawanpunjabithewriter,n/a,17/08/2025,"Documentary? Well, that's not what I'm looking for was my first reaction when I got to know about it. But being a die hard Cricket fan, it was always on the cards I could give it a go anytime. I knew I was going to witness the ball tampering incident in this series. However, as soon as I watched the first episode, I was awe-amazed. I had never thought in my life I would be able to watch such a brilliant Cricket Web Series in my life. I loved the Australian Cricket! I loved the ruthlessness. We can never think we will be able to watch so much of the dressing room talks, scenes, team meetings and so much.
This was all behind the scenes that happens off the field. Australian Cricket has been exceptional over the years.
However, I have heard this from some not many that the Indian Cricket side is shown to be good off Cricket. But I deny after watching that. I see Virat aggressive and arrogant on the field. In the test series, I have seen live Rishab Pant bantering and abusing Australian batsmen behind the stumps, which is not good. No doubt, I love Indian team. But we should have leaders like MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma in the cricket team - cool, composed and smart.
What I didn't like was Indian Fans were not shown as a bright part of the cricket.
Leaving all that, this series had goosebumps. It had all you must have never seen before. I would like to see an IPL team's journey like this.",False
3,10,Masterpiece.,rohansodha,n/a,17/08/2025,Best series of the year ! The way they have set up the plots is just excellent. This deserves a 10/10,False
4,10,Excellent series,svsrriitkgp,n/a,17/08/2025,"Enjoying it so far, thought it will be a normal boring documentary till 2nd ep, but once you enter next episodes it addicts you with its wonderful scenes and emotions, wish other teams would also do like this. I have watched 5 eps till now, will update my review if reqd later, thanks.
Update: now that i have finished all the eps, the series only gets better with each episode, if u r a cricket fan or not u will love this series.",False
5,10,A compelling inside look,theojclark,n/a,17/08/2025,"Unbelievably fantastic access to the Australian cricket team while they were rebuilding. This is really a story about leadership and how to build a team.Even if cricket wasn't your thing you could get something out of this. But If you followed the Australian cricket team over the last 18 months, then this is a must watch.",False
6,9,One word: STUNNING!,Minhaz923,n/a,17/08/2025,"An absolute stunning documentary that shows post effect on Australian Cricket Team as they go through a transition after a big blow due to ball tampering scandal. The sound effects are sensational as well as the camera shots are amazing! The interviews and the inside stories of dressing room makes this documentary more and more intensive!
Don't miss out on it!",False

8,10,Stunning behind the scenes look at the revival of Australian cricket,arnab_das,n/a,17/08/2025,"The Test is a beautifully crafted documentary. Having unprecedented access to the Australian cricket team's dressing room and meetings, the makers of the documentary take us on a long journey towards the revival of Australian cricket post the ball tampering crisis.As a cricket fan, I not only loved the behind the scenes glimpse into the top tier sport, I also loved the frank confessions from the Australian cricketers about the tough road that lay ahead of them. I hope Amazon sanctions more of these cricket documentaries from now on. They're a delight to watch.",False
9,10,Fantastic crickumentary!,user-9-83783,n/a,17/08/2025,"What an amazing docuseries showcasing the rise of the new era of Australian Cricket! The downfall of Australian Cricket Brand after the infamous ""Sandpaper Scandal"" and it's steady rise to power under the able leadership of JL is a treat to watchðŸ‘Œ",False
10,10,A Must For Every Cricket Fan,alistairpowell,n/a,17/08/2025,"Watching this at home on the other side of the world reminds you what it is to be a cricket fan.It doesn't matter that I support a different team, I am living every moment.",False
11,10,A brilliant series,gopalchandak95,n/a,17/08/2025,One of the best sports series I have watched.It is very well written and showcased. Takes you deep inside the Australian dressing room. It shows how much effort ACB has put into rebuilding the team after the sandpaper incident.,False
12,n/a,Loved it,n/a,n/a,17/08/2025,As a Canadian living in Australia for 15 years watching cricket to me always seemed like punishment. After watching this I am completely hooked. Loved seeing the personalities and gamesmanship behind the sport. Really in-depth look behind the scenes of a complete rebuild of a team and it was wonderful to watch. Really enjoyed it....,False
13,6,Nicely Constructed PR Piece,tav44,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is a very interesting watch and the insight into the inner workings of a professional sports team are well executed.This issue is however there is no real examination into what actually happened with regards the the ball tempering scandal - which should be the central theme to the entire series. The producers really did miss a trick by not framing the series by what the mentality of Australian athletes had become and the aura of entitlement that surrounded Australian modern sports.Contrasting point this with the Langer generation of hard graft and fair play would have made this a much more powerful series. A point that applies not just to sport, but Australian society as a whole.Although entertaining, the series essentially plays out as an overly patriotic, puff PR piece attempting to rebuild Australia's damaged reputation from 'sand paper gate'.Great shame but ultimately worth a watch.",False
14,5,A desperate effort to retrieve pride,arghya-17700,n/a,17/08/2025,"To be honest I have mixed feelings about the series. On one hand I'm moved by the emotional journey #AustralianCricketTeam has been through after the Cape Town incident but on the other hand I'm disappointed by the fact that how much the series is biased towards #AustralianCricketTeam, such as they've shown the bad side of #ViratKohli and how he went against #TimPaine in Perth, 2nd Test, 2018-19 but they didn't show the good of him when he insisted the crowd to cheer for #SteveSmith instead of booing him in the 2019 World Cup match. Also here is a team which *never respected their opponent nor did know the difference between abuse and banter, now all of a sudden expecting respect from their opponents and also talking about the difference between abuse and banter through out the whole series when they have done wrong!!!*( before Cape Town incident )",False
15,9,A gripping story,alokjoy,n/a,17/08/2025,We all know what happened outside of the dressing room of the team the series shows us how every people involved in the team went through about things from the inside . The series brings us closer to the characters and temperament of the players what they were going through what they were feeling through the tough times . Really enjoyed the show .,False
16,9,Brilliant,xtrem_pushp,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is just brilliant. From the regrets to greatness, this documentary showcases the emotional side of the game unlike anything till now . From being villains to heroes with sheer focus and determination and to win back the respect and trust of entire nation , this shows why the Aussies are never under for too long.",False
17,10,Brilliant,alex-bouchier,n/a,17/08/2025,"Absolutely outstanding series. Engaging throughout, beautifully put together and eye-opening. It even made me like Australian cricketers which is something!",False
18,8,An English perspective,peterrichboy,n/a,17/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this series and in particular the dressing room scenes, team talks and coaches meetings. However I couldn't help but feel this was made to try and redeem Australia's reputation after the shameful ball tampering in South Africa. That is quickly dealt with in episode one. From then on it's a jingoistic succession of how great it is to wear the baggie green and Represent the great country that is Australia. It would have been nice to have heard perspectives from opposing captains journalists. Instead every interview is with an Australian journalist player coach and Justin Langer in particular. Every interview is played with a patriotic soundtrack. The only time in the Australia were any good was when the cheats came back into the side in particular Smith who single handily carried that team through the Ashes. Smith smashes the poms and all is forgiven. Not by me Smith shamed his country the sport and can count himself very fortunate to still be playing the game.",False
19,10,Never thought I'd say this bout Aussies being an Indian,vbajpei,n/a,17/08/2025,"Just binged watched the show ""The Test - A new era for Australia Team"" and damn it just moved me.. Being an Indian our next big rivals after Pak are the Aussies.. And some moments from this documentary got my eyes wet.. I was like.. Damn these guys are cricket crazy just like we are.. I just think ppl shud watch it.. The way smudgy (I discovered this is smith's name in his team after watching the series) came back after the scandal was epic!!!",False

21,10,A masterpiece!,jasonmsmith-99903,n/a,17/08/2025,Amazon has created something that all true Australian or even cricket fans will enjoy. Looking forward to the next iteration!,False
22,9,Well made.,rhlchwdr,n/a,17/08/2025,"Was exciting to watch justin langer and the team's build up towards the ashes series. . As a person from india, i always loved watching smith and warner. Ben stokes was amazing.",False
23,n/a,Brilliant,n/a,n/a,17/08/2025,"I have never left a review here but felt this series warrant a review from me.This is a MUST watch for any cricket lover. Set aside your allegiance to any team or country and watch this for the beauty of the sport. I wish Justin Langer was my boss at work! What a gent!
Greetings from South Africa!",False
24,7,Excellent first season,okohne,n/a,17/08/2025,"Not the biggest cricket fan, but always interested in how teams come back from extreme lows and which characteristics shine through in the people involved. The first season was excellent, you got to know the major players involved, the strength of JL and what he brought to the team and how much his value was. Behind the scenes were excellent, the internal struggles and the stead fast drive that JL had to succeed.I was curious as to what the second season would bring and I found myself fast forwarding through alot of each episode. Became more of a soap opwra with to much focus on the players opinions and views. We're to good now (thanks to JL) and he's to hard on us. And we don't need him anymore. Lost loads of respect for the team and how they acted. 9/10 for season 1, 5/10 for season 2.",False
25,1,What a load of kak,Paul-79-900693,n/a,17/08/2025,I couldn't watch anymore after the 2nd episode.Celebrating a draw against Pakistan in Dubai. Come on. This series should have dedicated an entire episode to sandpaper gate. I wish I could give Warner and Smith a 1 star review. The ACB should be ashamed of themselves for allowing these cheats back. And for making a rookie do their cheating. Ozzies let themselves down here. Lifetime ban.,False

1,8,"Interesting insights into the band, especially into HP Baxxter's mindset",adrian-minnig96,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary offers some history about HP Baxxter's early life and how the band came to be. Former band members talk about their experiences and in general what they say seems genuine.I liked the cinematography as quieter scenes are directly followed by scenes with loud techno music as interesting contrasting elements.It feels like the band members, especially HP Baxxter, acted mostly natural and were not acting too much for the camera. The audience can witness arguments within the band, emotional reactions and funny unplanned moments.Cinematography was not in the traditional netflix style with title cards for time and places and dramatic music. Instead, we are presented mostly with buildings or street signs to find out where the scene is taking place and the musical background is of course Scooter sounds.Some scenes could have been shortened a little bitThe band's struggle with COVID-19 restrictions and the influence the pandemic had on their music offers something special not seen in other documentaries on music bands.Some scenes could have been shortened a little bit, the total runtime of 1h 53 min is a bit too long. On the other hand, I would have been interested in seeing more of HP Baxxter's private life.Definitely worth a watch for Scooter fans or anyone interested in how a band struggled during COVID.",False
2,9,End of the first Techno band,ziggy1887-467-264556,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's a docu with a (too) short time. It shows ws how stupid the German government is and what's rave. But I've seen a band, just a dictator (as his mother said) and two guys besides. The shows two kind of artists.Hard to see what kind of effects Corona has (had) on artists and promoters around the world. But absolute amazing to see is ravers are united in what they love and live.I've seen a docu about the hard worked success of somebody who wants to live his dream and arrived that goal. But what did he paid for? Live on tour is hard, for sure! But it's easier together, and that's what i missen by the head of this combo. Hard but true!This movie shows the end of Scooter!",True
3,10,We are family,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,Which means there is not always peaceful harmony! So no pun intended as always. Scooter is more than just the blond leading man many think of when they hear the bands name. For better or worse - and definitely some would like more credit.But let's get back to the beginning - we get to meet HP Baxters mom. And she has quite a few interesting stories to tell. We get a better picture regarding her son. It tries to stay chronological and succeeds most of the time. And that slowly but surely gives us a look inside the mind of HP ... he is quite the character ... and eccentric. He knows what he wants - and he can be quite ... well difficult if he does not get exactly to what he wants.The documentary or the crew really gets some interesting bits .. and all that because of ... well Corona. Well most of it - HP seems impossible to please! Even by those around him - but they all know him and the way he operates ... so even after arguments there is no bad blood ... at least it does not feel like there is ... money and business aside ...,False

1,7,The Nature of Diplomacy,WilliamK-74,n/a,15/08/2025,"Facing War provides an unparalleled insight into the nature of diplomacy: Hardly any film provides such direct access and close-up look at top diplomats at work preventing conflicts and wars. It is especially intriguing during a time in world history when diplomacy is under increased strain and when the widespread perception of its effectiveness is being called into question. The film also focuses on UN Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. It feels reckless to criticize the film for not going deeper into this portrait, as there must be certain security considerations that must be taken into account. But it is nevertheless the absence of the family in the film is sorely missed. Watching this movie is recommended for anyone with even the smallest interest in world politics.",False
2,10,Humans doing their best to solve big issues,nicolas-martinez-25118,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is probably the single most genuine, touching and funny one I have been given to watch. A unusually authentic glimpse into the life of someone who's equally unusual task is to try to keep the world's largest military alliance running while being confronted with the most terrible war on European soil since WW2 while being no less a human than about anybody else. The very simple, truly humane words, looks and gestures exchanged mere seconds before even the most formal NATO summit or conference between key deciders and leaders say sometimes much more than what is being said in formal settings, and this documentary is a testimony of just that. It is then difficult to not see how true friendship and genuine concern is the most powerful weapon even in this position. A definitive must watch!",False
3,10,Very entertaining!,Abby_1977,n/a,15/08/2025,"The camera´s access to World leaders is mind boggling and the score by Röyksopp is awesome! I felt the story was tight and engaging - not as historical and archive based as I had expected. There are some truly spectacular moments between Zelensky, Stoltenberg, Orban and Erdogan in this film, interactions between the World´s most powerful people that I haven't seen captured on camera before. It´s an extremely timely piece given the geopolitical situation we find ourselves in and I just hope that all political leaders could study the work being done in ""Facing War"". The film somehow shows that we are all human beings trying to cope withe the situation as best as we can.",False
4,10,Exceptional,JonasA-84,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA unique look behind the scenes on what's happening om the inside (and the top) of Nato. Very well put together, and they have managed to make the documentary both interesting and intriguing with a cup of good humour on the top. Exceptional story telling - and super relevant!This portrait of Jens Stoltenberg also shows how important personal connection between the top leaders of the world is. It is quite baffeling at times, the game that is played at the top. Through this documentary, Stoltenberg shows that he knows how to play the game, but also in a very credible way. He isn't fooling anyone, but really goving his best to achieve his and Nato's goals.",True

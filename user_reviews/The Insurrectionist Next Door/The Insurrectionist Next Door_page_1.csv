1,7,"Expected to see a shaming and ridiculing of Trump supporters, but the opposite was true",imseeg,n/a,15/08/2025,"The daughter of Nancy Pelosi (speaker of the house, who was hated by many Trump supporters) made a documentary about these people who stormed the Capitol building.I expected to see a partisan colored portrait, which would ridicule or at least paint a negative picture of all these Trump supporters who now have to face jail time, but the opposite was true. This was a fair portrait. Honestly.Not only was it a fair portrait, Pelosi's daughter made the prosecuted Jan 6 protesters look human and innocent. Most of them really had no intention at all for instigating violence or even entering the Capitol building at all. But nonetheless they got lengthy jail times of 3 months minimum for merely entering the Capitol building.What's further interesting about this documentary is the director's amazement that these prosecuted and jailed Jan 6 protesters still do wholeheartedly support Donald Trump. Not an inch of doubt about their loyalty, even after all that has happened.This documentary is giving the Jan 6 protesters a human face and makes understandable (by interviewing several of these January 6th protestors) why many folks did what they did. Really interesting watch, which touches on many prejudices and misunderstandings.",False
2,7,Questions unasked,tallgirltv,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is not her best effort, however, the film unintentionally shines a light on the loneliness and low self esteem of young men in this country. There were certain scenes where she could have asked follow-up questions, but apparently chose not to. And she never dove deeper on any topic. Nor did she ask any of those arrested how the feel about not being able to vote as a convicted felon. What this film appears to be is a series of pre-interviews, but ended up being the entire film. Clunky and a bit directionless. Where she could have pushed back, she chose not to. She seemed intent on getting each J6'er to blame Trump (which is fine by me), but could have asked questions differently to coax a true answer out of each interviewee. The Hernandez interview was sad.",True
3,6,Another Good Documentary by Alexandra Pelosi,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a mother good documentary by Alexandra Pelosi. Pelosi is the daughter of Former Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and an acclaimed documentary filmmaker. Her Travels with George is a terrific and humanizing look at George Bush's Presidential election campaign. This one looks at the stories, through footage, and their own words of some of the convicted January 6 Capital Rioters. Pelosi does not soft soap her approach to their questioning, and I appreciate that. This gives you a look at some of the Trump followers and the impact of the January 6 riots on their life and perspectives. The film is intriguing. It is worth watching.",False
4,10,Fascinating,williamstx-12991,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very well done and informative. What surprised me was the genuine compassion Ms. Pelosi has for these people, even the ones who expressed no remorse for their actions. I don't think I would be as generous to people who wished harm to my mother. Letting them speak for themselves was the correct approach, and it helped me understand a little better why they did what they did. It's heartbreaking to see how damaged people were manipulated into doing terrible things. Maybe understanding how powerful people dupe their followers will help us avoid repeating this kind of violence. I wish I were more confident of that.",False
5,9,Intriguing,theknownames,n/a,15/08/2025,"Intriguing in that we get to spend some time ( albeit limited ; more of a snapshot ) with individuals who have been charged with crimes relating to their participation in the January 6th Capital breach.Each has their own life and story , some are more easily empathized with than others . They are all US citizens who were either caught up in ,instigators of or antagonizers in the 'storming of the capital' . Motivations , regrets and personal insights are mixed , offering more insight into what brought each person there and their reflections on that day and the aftermath.The plight of these individuals offers an often sympathetic yet brutal hard look at what our neighbors were involved in and how easily it can happen or be completely avoided .The documentary style can get a bit daunting as it's interviews with person after person without filler or other info pertaining to that day.Collectively it works well enough and isn't too long .It would have been helpful if updates were paired with photos .",False
6,3,Pathetic,m-sill-59-365390,n/a,15/08/2025,"Being a democrat as well as a UX professional, I can honestly say this was one of THE most poorly produced films I have ever watched. When doing contextual interviews, the interviewer should never ""lead"" (verbally imply) ANYTHING that could ""set the stage"" for the interviewee's answer. Peloci's delivery and tone were directly manipulative, accusatory and snarky. She held the camera, asked the questions, AS WELL AS has the same last name as the woman who's office was defiled! How are they supposed to respond!?I REALLY wanted to like this. I wanted to see, hear and feel what the ""other side"" was/is experiencing. Instead I was left confused, STILL not knowing what we are NOT understanding about their struggles and hardships.",False
7,1,Nepotistic Cringe,bretnelson-24981,n/a,15/08/2025,"The beginning of this film said it was made by HBO Documentary Films, and after seeing the filmmaker make a great pitch on Bill Maher, I was convinced I would see a side of the January 6th topic that was new and interesting. Instead, this was seemingly a extra long YouTube video. The filmmaker is a horrible interviewer and often leads the conversation, which makes her sound like a hateful older sister trying to get their little brother say something condemning on video. She talks to the person she is interviewing with such disgust, hate and cold contempt it is often very irritating and very ""showing of her privilege"", she often makes fun of her interviewee in a way that they don't always catch, which also makes her a bully.",False
8,10,A must watch,dkr0714,n/a,15/08/2025,"I recently had the pleasure of watching the captivating documentary ""The Insurrectionist Next Door,"" and I must say, it left an indelible mark on my perspective. The film, directed by the acclaimed filmmaker, delves deep into the underlying currents of extremism and radicalization that can lurk within seemingly ordinary communities.From the outset, the documentary sets a gripping tone, drawing viewers into the lives of individuals who, in their pursuit of perceived justice and change, gradually become entangled in the intricate web of extremist ideologies. Through meticulous storytelling and thought-provoking interviews, the director masterfully crafts a narrative that not only unveils the complexities of radicalization but also underscores the critical importance of vigilance and understanding within our society.What truly sets ""The Insurrectionist Next Door"" apart is its unflinching dedication to portraying the human element behind the headlines, peeling back the layers of the individuals involved to reveal the nuanced motivations, struggles, and vulnerabilities that underpin their radical choices. By doing so, the documentary succeeds in fostering empathy and introspection, urging viewers to confront the underlying issues that can breed extremism in our communities.Furthermore, the film's visual prowess is commendable, seamlessly weaving together compelling narratives with evocative cinematography that brings the intense emotions and conflicts to life. The striking juxtaposition of intimate personal stories and the broader societal implications creates a powerful and thought-provoking viewing experience that lingers long after the credits roll.In today's social and political climate, where understanding and addressing extremism have become imperative, ""The Insurrectionist Next Door"" stands as a poignant and timely piece of cinematic art that prompts essential conversations and encourages proactive measures in combating radicalization. It is a testament to the power of film in not only entertaining but also enlightening and influencing positive societal change.Overall, I firmly believe that ""The Insurrectionist Next Door"" is a documentary that transcends its genre, leaving a profound impact on its audience and sparking crucial dialogue about the roots of extremism and the significance of fostering empathy and unity within our communities.",False
9,9,"Funny, insightful, and interesting documentary",deeegenerate,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really liked the way the filmmaker approached the making of this documentary. She was obviously a liberal but she didn't make the whole thing about partisanship. It really seemed as though both interviewer and interviewee made an honest attempt to be cordial and friendly with one another. I wish the rest of the country would use this as an example of how people of different political ideologies should get along.. The subjects were very colorful and very interesting. They really surprised me in many ways. The interviews were informal but fairly in-depth and honest as well. . Overall this program was insightful, informative, engaging, and actually pretty funny!",False
10,3,A lot left to be desired,kaseylearned,n/a,15/08/2025,"Upon viewing the film, there's no denying its potential. It promised an insightful look into a complex issue, and the anticipation was palpable. Pelosi's role, however, raises eyebrows due to her prominence in the political arena. One can't help but wonder about the level of objectivity and impartiality that was brought to the storytelling. While there appeared to be sincere attempts to strike a balance in presenting different facets of the story, the end result often left viewers scratching their heads, searching for more definitive answers and a clearer perspective. The narrative sometimes meandered, creating a disjointed feeling that reminded one of a student film, albeit with a significantly larger budget. It is indeed an intriguing decision on HBO's part to include this in their repertoire. But then, it's also commendable that they are willing to showcase a wide range of perspectives, emphasizing the importance of diversity in storytelling.",False
11,1,Painfully awkward and poorly produced,deeprajkunnath,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm as anti-Trump as they come, and an avid watcher of every documentary related to the travesty of his failed attempt at governance. But this was one was a yawn fest and so cringe fully awkward that I had to bail less than a quarter of my way through. The only reason it's made it this far in terms of promotion and airtime is because of the obvious nepotism around the producer's family name, which can only allow something to go so far in an industry before it falls laughably flat once it enters the town square of public opinion. This documentary had a lot of potential and I'm hoping someone more cinematographically competent can pick up its broken pieces and run with the construct to make a piece decent for television.",False
12,1,Repugnant Quasi-Doc Confirmation Bias Exploitation Fest,wpbhomes,n/a,15/08/2025,"Title says it all. That this is a supposed 'liberal' 'progressive' perspective is all you need to know about how hijacked term, which has lost all meaning in a contemporary philosophical or political sense. Sneering down it's elitist, Big Everything/Wall Street nose at the sort of people that used to be the bedrock of the Democratic Party, the forgotten middle and working classes, the very forgetting of whom by the Clinton/Obama-era Wall St/Welfare/Warfare Obama Phones & Predator Drones Democrats ALLOWED a character like DJT onto the scene (and whether or not he was an unwitting tool for them or working in tandem is an open question) along with his exploitation and false dreams he offered up. Terrible production quality, if my money financed this I'd be wondering why so little of it wound up on the screen, with even by Michael Moore-style pseudo-doc polemic standard is a gross excersie in violating every ethical guideline of doc making (everything is leading, insiuating, an answer that lays out its cartoon 'questions' afterwards. This box of Total filled with Capn Crunch is authoritarian propaganda posing as an expose of the very same. The reality is these people cheered with bloodlust as a gentle vegan hippie with no criminal record was locked up for two years-nine months of which were in solitary confinement-by definition, torture, for walking into a building he was told by police he was allowed to enter, hurting nobody nor would he ever dream to. This is repulsive, phony passive-aggressive nonsense that every one of the people I was watching with--about as diverse a group politically as could be possible--understood immediately to be such. Only the MOST easily gulled unsophisticated insecure wannabe nitwits will be fooled by it. Of the 20-30K total that will ever see it, that is. Not surprising to see the producers hack reality and tabloid TV backgrounds...they sure honed their skills. Now HBO buys their rancid wares. What does that say? Who knows, or cares. These fake PR intern-written positive reviews are hilarious. Enjoy that $200 folks, AI is taking your gigs very soon. Or maybe it already has?",False
13,1,Sadly abusive and pathetically vitriolic,gryphaeon-09077,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerToo many times does the interviewer attack or belittle the person they are interviewing. It's plainly clear that there is animosity and vitriol, and her pretending that she isn't on a witch hunt is sadly pathetic.I was hoping to see a thoughtful, or at least inquisitive, set of interviews that might explain why things happened the way they did, but instead we were treated to cognitive bias with a sprinkling of thinly veiled contempt.The fact that she actually asked someone if they were trying to murder her mother just shows that there's no possible way for her to have been objective enough to be able to have created a true documentary.But then again, diverse thoughts and opinions are only good until they're different, right?",True
14,1,The one question that should have been asked during this joke of a documentary.,tyleroosse,n/a,15/08/2025,"What the hell was her daughter doing there that day filming for a documentary? It's the exact same thing as ""the capitol officer who tricked the angry mob and led them away from the main chamber"" on youtube. Everyone watching the video and commenting, but no one asked or pointed out that the camera man somehow stayed ahead of the officer the entire way. So is the camera man the hero since he choose the route or maybe, just maybe, it was staged.Actually you could probably chalk this one up to Nancy's impeccable ESP seeing as her and her husband know what stocks to buy and sell a day or two before a big swing in the market. I mean obviously she can see the future and told her daughter to be there but if she knew it was going to happen then why did she turn down the POTUS' offer to send national guard there prior to all the events that day.......?",False

1,9,Touching journey with a dubious person,gurkpeter,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is an exceptional 10 year long story showing a scientist Henry Markram and his team of scientists who won the lottery of 1Bn EUR for their scam project.The film was a very captivating experience for me depicting not just pure rationality (science) but persons and some emotion of the characters. The documentary may be most interesting to scientists but is certainly a recommendable for the general audience.The reason I cannot give 10 stars to this great film is that I feel the authors were a bit too forgiving to their 'hero'. They mostly fail to touch the question: ""how could he make such a scam happen"", what sort of political meddling is part of the system that allows so much money being so much mistargeted. They avoid the question of responsibility. Maybe because so many scientist were involved who wanted to have the bits falling off the table? It would have been interesting to ask a few politicians, EU bureaucrats: how could they fail to spot the scam? This would show how little most politicians cared and care ever since. Well, at least the completely mishandled COVID crisis shows how difficult it is to understand science and relate it to actual problems of our society.",False

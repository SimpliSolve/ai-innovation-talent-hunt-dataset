1,6,Doomed from the start,alanfisher2001,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really could not see the point of this build, the current electric car record was set by Johnny Smith in an 800 brake horsepower electric toy car. For some reason, the guy decided to build a 500 brake horsepower beetle so it has almost half the power and more weight. So not surprisingly it was nowhere near the performance and not even close to the Tesla. Surely they must have known this early on in the build , so I know they've been paid by television company to make something, but really in order to be credible to the viewer, the basics have to be right. The best bit was Guy riding the Cowell electric bike that just looks to be a Widowmaker.",True
2,1,Weak and disappointing,paul-davies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe usually brilliant Guy Martin was badly advised on this one. It could almost be seen as anti-electric car but I suspect it's just poor production. The explanations of the technology were naff and school boyish. The so called record breaker they built wasn't even as fast as a bog standard Tesla Model S Performance (10.4 by Mat Watson), never mind the Johnny Smith car or the new Tesla Plaid. The new Rimac moves the game on even further. A complete waste of the viewers time, I hope he follows this up and does it properly, maybe with Mate Rimac?",True

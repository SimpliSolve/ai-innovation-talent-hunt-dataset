1,9,"Captivating, intense film",SpacemanBob,n/a,15/08/2025,"An amazing, courageous woman on a mission to find justice for her brutally murdered 16 year old daughter. Her story is all at the same time inspirational, tragic, and infuriating.I wasn't familiar with this case prior to the film, some of the things that take place are just maddening. Asking myself, how could this be?Very well done film. It's worth seeing for sure.",False
2,9,Heartbreaking,sanateam,n/a,15/08/2025,What a dysfunctional world we live in! This can't be the life humans were created to live.,False
3,9,"This is Mexico, a femicide country...",cocoboy-74647,n/a,15/08/2025,"Marisela and RubÃ­ are just one of thousands of the femicides that ends unpunished. The film portray the feminist movement as the actual situation,the suffering of the familys that lost someone and the frustration of can't do nothing because the country is full of corruption and violence.",False
4,10,Incredibly moving!,Tiionax,n/a,15/08/2025,"Such a powerful documentary!
As someone who never heard of Marisela Escobedo, I am still shaken by this story and in awe of this woman!Kudos to entire team who made this! I hope her name and her story will be known all over the world.Do yourself a favor and go watch this!",False
5,10,AS A MEXICAN...,anettevrivera,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am glad they did this documentary about this case, about Marisela, whos case I didn't witness cause I was young, and to know that we've always as WOMAN have been fighting for justice it's just so unfair to see, that we mean so little to the government of Mexico it's just too much. I hope everyone sees why we have to protest, to destroy things, CAUSE YOU GET NOTHING BY BELIEVING IN THE SYSTEM, you get killed!",False
6,10,I Wept,awebs-44571,n/a,15/08/2025,"Powerfully moving and utterly gut-wrenching. Create the appropriate time and space to watch this, as it will linger heavily with you for a while afterward.",False
7,10,Heartbreaking,colegodfrey,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had no background of this case prior to watching the documentary. Just when I would think the story was starting to slow down, it would take unexpected twists and turns. The injustice Marisela (and her family) experienced is truly heartbreaking. Yet, Marisela herself must have been an incredibly strong person to seek justice for her daughter, while putting herself into danger. I highly recommend watching this. Just be prepared for an extremely sad documentary.",False
8,7,An above average crime documentary,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,15/08/2025,"A compelling and very sad story. I think as a documentary it was executed alright, but it's definitely more impactful for what the story is rather than the way that story's told.Presentation also feels a bit too sleek and ""Netflixy"" for lack of a better word, with all the uninspired music and certain editing decisions you see time and time again in their true crime documentaries, but at least it's 109 minutes rather than a 10.9 hour miniseries.It's engaging for most of that runtime, too. Some of the aspects of the story being milked for suspense/shocks might usually rub me the wrong way, but I don't think it crossed a line here. Plus so many interviews with family members makes me optimistic they were okay with the way their story was told, which is the main thing.",False
9,10,Speechless,daze_r,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerSuch a powerful and heart wrenching story. Did anyone else notice in the end where it was stated that ex Chihuahua governor CÃ©sar Duarte was captured earlier this year in Miami for embezzlement charges ðŸ˜³,True
10,6,Sad,fmwongmd,n/a,15/08/2025,Portrayed here is a very dysfunctional justice system in Mexico centering over the murder of Marisela Escobedo's daughter.,False
11,10,Eye opening,lesliecarriedo,n/a,15/08/2025,Idk if I missed it but does anyone know what happened to the baby of the daughter?,False
12,10,Sad masterpiece,danielcereto,n/a,15/08/2025,"My girlfriend is Mexican and she was the one to point me towards this Documentary. It is a real sad story about the situation of women and children in Mexico. Thanks God the situation has changed a bit for better but still a long road to drive to achieve at least European standards.First, this one is a realistic documentary with real and shocking images about the whole story is brutal. The family involving and caring here made me cry. I felt sad for the family even I didn't know anything about the story before watch it.Second, politicians, judges and law enforcement s*cks. I can barely understand why this story went too far.Anyway I don't want to spoil anything watch it and learn about who was Marisela Escobedo.",False
13,10,True injustice,eryui,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is a punch in the face, it really makes you angry and very sad.
A woman, an exceptional mother, left alone against vile cowards, corrupt and criminals instead of being defended in every possible way.
It really made my blood boil.10/10 because her story had to be honored, told and disclosed.",False
14,8,"Justice sought, justice denied",jondallaslawyer,n/a,15/08/2025,"At its center, this movie is about a mother's struggle to bring her daughter's killer to justice. But in a broader sense the movie is about all the mothers in a Mexican state looking for their disappeared daughters. The filmmakers do an excellent job of bringing these people to life. But don't expect a happy ending.",False
15,10,HEARTBROKEN,rogeliodavila-98119,n/a,15/08/2025,"Theres no justice in Mexico
And never gonna be justice in any place (Mexico)
Even in Ciudad Juarez,one of the most dangerous citys in the entire world
They kill Rubi,Marisela and the other guy!
The violence killed them,the government did
As they kill my lil brother! In Ciudad Juarez
Rest in peace to every single innocent person
Like Rubi,Marisela and my brother and a thousand innocents more!",False
16,10,Sad story about another problem in Mexico,dan_c_ro,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't know about this story until I saw this documentary. I knew about the corruption and cartel problems in Mexico. But I didn't know that so many women are killed there and they don't receive justice. This is a story about a mother's fight against the corrupt system in Mexico. It is a sad story which reflects unfortunately the sad problems that exist there, corruption, violence, drugs and violence against women. Sad but true.",False
17,10,A heartbreaking but important piece of work,mujali-48677,n/a,15/08/2025,"I did not know any background about this story and was not prepared for the emotional journey this documentary would put me through. It was a really tough watch, after watching it I was shocked at the injustices which occur in Mexico and how some disgusting, pitiful excuse for human beings have no regard for the sacredness of human life. And the people who are supposed to help you are in the pockets of the murderers, so where is Mexican society supposed to turn to and who can they trust? This is sick and I pray for the wonderful people of Mexico that this documentary will serve as an eye-opener and will help start positive change. Marisela god bless you and may your soul now be in a beautiful place with Rubi. You were so brave, strong and fearless, those who silenced you were nothing but evil cowards who will never find peace.",False
18,10,The heart wrenching sadness of mindless murders,gregdtc,n/a,15/08/2025,"A powerful and moving documentary with stories which made me angry, sad and in total shock. But on the other it left me feeling total respect, admiration and compassion for the innocent few. A well made and critical piece of film to help support the urgent change and future of society in Mexico.",False
19,9,Great and heartbreaking documentary,tesi-68274,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerYou wouldn't have guessed that this is a real life ~movie~. How dangerous is to deal with narcos. Even though it wasn't directly the case. But Marisela wanted to have a response from the justice and they gave her the back and was sadly murdered.
It's almost like a fiction movie. Unbelievable what is going on in Mexico. I'm deeply sorry for the people who has no justice because the government it's not managed by the politicians, its managed by the narcos and there's no way to stop it.
My heart is with the people in Mexico.",True
20,10,Justice,ingamazonaite,n/a,15/08/2025,I really hope family will get justice for once.Very tragic story about what really matters in life- family and love.Fantastic documentary.,False
21,10,Important film,cindemanoel,n/a,15/08/2025,This is a heartbreaking and very important film. I am so glad it was made and hope the film can save lives through once again bringing feminicide into the limelight. Hopefully an Oscar contender,False
22,10,This documentary is all about not giving up.,zsawork,n/a,15/08/2025,"Netflix Documentaries are fire.
It has become a trend that people love shows which have real events to it but sadly families and people in face the realty.
The documentary shows How crime in Mexico is alarming and, the government has to protect those criminal organizations.
The only thing about the documentary its too long because of the details.
Worth watching!!",False
23,10,The beauty of a committed mother's love and the horror of an incorrigible government.,LRTellez,n/a,15/08/2025,"There is nothing more unfortunate than losing a child perhaps for something that could be avoided, but there is something, that the mother fights for justice and the latter is a disguise for the crime.Deciding whether this is a recommendable film is very disjunctive. It is a situation that everyone should know about, but for the closest viewing, the Mexican one, may leave you so bad that you begin to see your world, your country, as something irremediable. A perception that is difficult to shake.The worst thing perhaps would be that even having a high-quality documentary like this, it is not enough for immediate action to be taken by those responsible today or by third parties out of mere compassion. It feels like a scream into the void.The documentary is limited to being expository, ""here are the facts"", but in that very sense, it is so difficult for it to detach itself from the genre of tragedy. It is so hopeless that crying will be the reaction, and the solution will be the thought of leaving everything behind for a country whose people are not to blame for their situation or even something sadder: resignation.",False

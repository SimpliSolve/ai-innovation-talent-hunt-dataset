1,7,Figo a Go-Go or Figo a No-Go?,Lejink,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm from Glasgow and can remember the massive furore when the Scotland international striker and ex-Celtic player Maurice Johnston had seemingly agreed to return to Celtic Park after a spell playing for Nantes in France. A lifelong Celtic fan and a Roman Catholic, he was actually pictured embracing the then Celtic manager Billy McNeill, while wearing a Celtic shirt. It seemed to be the proverbial ""done deal"".Then, the earthquake broke as Johnston reneged on his promise and instead signed with Celtic's great Glasgow rivals, Rangers, then under hard-bitten manager Graeme Souness, who thus completed a stunning coup and also broke the Ibrox team's historic tradition of signing only Protestant players. The fall-out from both sides was massive, the Celtic fans believing that Johnston had betrayed them while many of the traditional Rangers fans were equally furious at Souness for bringing a Roman Catholic into the side for the first time.I mention all this because for me it was the most sensational transfer story in my memory and in many ways it still is. In fact I'd say it's worth a Netflix documentary film too. That said, in global terms the fuss over the Johnston transfer seems to pale into insignificance when compared to when Luis Figo the Portuguese World Cup star, switched his allegiance from Barcelona to Real Madrid in the year 2000.Over the course of this documentary feature, the main participants in the saga look back, although naturally in a revisionist way, at how events unfolded and subsequently played out, although it has to be said, their stories do not match up against each other. Even today, it seems the truth remains concealed.The film puts the signing in its political context of two coincidental power struggles going on for the club presidencies of both Madrid and Barca. Figo had been at Barcelona for five successful years, seemingly fully integrated into the Catalonian culture. He's famously caught on camera celebrating a victory, with his hair dyed blue and red and openly mocking Madrid, his team's main rival. The fans at the club adore him and he seems completely settled, to the extent that he has married, had a child and bought a house there. I think it's important to say though that Figo is obviously of Portuguese nationality and so had no underlying hometown feelings to contend with.Anyway, the rival candidate for the Madrid presidency is an underdog but his campaign against the successful incumbent, who had just presided over two Champions League victories in a row, catches fire when he announces that he will sign Figo for Madrid.This boast greatly helps him to win the presidency and so begins the frenzied tug-of-war for the player between the two clubs, the matter sparking much media interest, especially in both competing cities, but also in the rest of Spain and indeed the wider sporting world for that matter.Finally, of course, we know that he did indeed sign for Real, to the delight of the Madrid fans but more particularly to the incandescent fury of the betrayed Barca fans.I listened carefully to the statements made by Figo, his agent and the two club presidents at the time. At one stage, Figo says that he wanted more recognition for his contribution to the Barcelona team which of course can only mean more money, which the new Barca president was not prepared to pay. We are told that he was under contract and had had pay rises in previous years. But it seems that where there's an agent there's a way and sure enough his very slippery agent and another go-between, the player's predecessor as the star international player for Portugal, Paulo Futre, got the deal done and were obviously very well rewarded financially for their part in the negotiations so I can only imagine what the player himself received at the time.The claim is made, with some justification, that this was the deal which changed the way football transfers would be done from then on. While I do believe some agents do represent their clients well, I'm genuinely of the opinion that the game as a whole was and would be a lot better off without them.So I probably side with the Barcelona fans in this affair, believing myself that Figo simply followed the money regardless of the consequences. He says it was worth it and certainly he was successful at Madrid for five subsequent years. Nevertheless as we saw at his first match back at Barcelona playing for Madrid, he was never going to be forgiven by his old fans, with some deeply offensive chants and banners against him and his family at the game while every time the player went to take a corner, he was pelted with rubbish from the terraces.As an old-school football follower, I'm of the conviction that there's far too much money sloshing around in the sport resulting in sky-high wages for players as well as sky-high commission-cuts for their agents.Figo himself obviously wants to put the record straight here, over 20 years later, but I remain unconvinced, as it seems to me that he's just one of many people in this compelling documentary purely in it for the money, but reluctant to admit it. Just remember that the next time the new football hero at your own team kisses their club badge to celebrate scoring a goal...",False
2,8,Recognizable,mickbuijing,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are a supporter of one of the 2 biggest clubs in your country (for me Feyenoord vs ajax), you feel the betrayal when a player goes to the arch-rival. This documentary gives an interesting look behind the scenes.",False
3,7,Entertaining with a lot of close-up shots,romes_afonso,n/a,16/08/2025,"At some point in your life, if you are a Football fan, you probably heard about Figo and this epic transfer/moment but here's a chance to go back in time and understand how this transfer changed Modern Football.This documentary, gives you testimonials from everyone involved with the decision but in the end, does not give you answers. ""Why? Who? When?""
It kinda creates a void you didn't knew you had and then doesn't fill it.It does feel like this could easily been done and achieved in 30minutes but for some reason, takes almost two hours.I was expecting more when I saw how long it was (Even Borat takes less time than this).If you are not a Football fan, it's still interesting as it explains parts of Spanish history and Football rivalries.The yays:Epic transfer that speaks for itself.The way it shows how the press was and is a big key in Football transfers.Some old footage that was well placed and edited that makes you go back in time.Paulo Futre. Legend and just survived a heart attack!Not so much:Time spent looking at people's faces... Honestly.Can't help but feel like this could've been easily done in half or even less the time it took.Not showcasing what Figo accomplished in Real vs. The downfall of Barcelona. Just a few lines saying oh this happened and that happened.",False
4,n/a,incredible how similar this is to Neymar's saga,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"If it wasn't tragic, it would be hilarious how Barcelona didn't learn anything from the Figo affair - and repeated the exact same story with Neymar.As a documentary, this is really well done - shows the facts, using great archival footage, asks questions to all the actors involved, and gets answers from them. Who's lying and who doesn't? You can make up your own mind about that.",False
5,7,What Would You Do if It Were You ?,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never been a football fan. I started watching football very late and stopped after watching it for about 10 years. I don't watch more than 15 years. Football is not as fun as it used to be, in my opinion. One of the best players of the footbal was Figo.. When I started watching football, Figo was already playing for Real Madrid and the team at that time was great. Later I learned that Figo transferred from Barcelona. At the time, I didn't know how big of a deal it was. Yes, it was a huge transfer and one of the most interesting and sounding transfer in football history. I've never researched it deeply. It wasn't interesting to me, but I saw and watched this Spanish documentary on Netflix. It was interesting. It was interesting to see each person speaking their own truth. I didn't understand how Barcelona fans were spewing so much hate. Football can be toxic sometimes. Frankly, I loved watching Fenerbahce, Barcelona and Liverpool while watching football and I think I was fan of these 3 clubs. Yes, the same thing happened between Fenerbahce and Galatasaray. Emre Belezoglu. But I couldn't understand. Traitor? No. For example, you can ask me, how would you react if Alex de Souza was transferred from Fenerbahce to Galatasaray? I would be upset. I'd be pissed, but if I was in the football arena, I wouldn't have thrown anything at him. Max. I would shout ""yuuuuu"". But I wouldn't give hate speech to his family. I never liked or understood this side of football. Why do people worship a team like a religion? What would you do if it were you?As a documentary, it satisfied me. It was an interesting documentary. I haven't watched football or anything related to football for a long time.",False
6,6,A lot of hype for nothing,sepit91,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo they build up suggesting that something huge will happen. And in the end, nothing happens. The whistle blows and game's over.Figo is clearly a liar and not so bright person. He messes up and tried to cheat everyone on his path. So muh excuses and explanations but no honest talk at all.So all this hype for a football trade, wow. I get that it's a sport document and it also sides about other stuff going on back then, but when the main focus is on so meaningless mess up, it's really weak.Maybe someone to Barcelona this might be interesting, but doubt that there's anything useful to them either.",True
7,7,Was Figo a traitor? The answer is up to you,mateoame,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not a Real Madrid fan, nor a Barcelona fan. I decided to watch this story because I was intrigued by the Figo transfer, which is a very popular topic in Spain and about which I know very little. All in all, I must admit that ""The Figo Affair"" is a rather interesting documentary that would appeal to football fans, regardless of their favourite club.The action has many ingredients of a good tale: charismatic characters, vested interests, passion and betrayal. After watching it, I think it is definitely a story that deserves to be shown. Although it was not entirely clarifying, it reveals some unknown aspects of the transfer.As for the production, it presents very valuable videos of the time, it manages to transport you to that era. I also liked the fact that the film uses Spanish, Portuguese and Catalan because it faithfully represents the reality of this story. However, I think the length of the film is a bit excessive - it could have omitted some parts of the RM vs Barça rivalry that are widely known.Luis Figo made a move that shocked the football world and aroused both love and hatred. Was he a traitor? Judge for yourself.",False
8,10,Insightful,infinaneek,n/a,16/08/2025,A truly great insight into the inner working of the tensions and corruption in the sport. Full of real archive footage and interviews with key figures.Must see for any football fan / sports business manager.Excellent score by Rival Consoles.,False
9,6,Good documentary,nicorip22,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very good documentary, I found it very interesting to see how everything happened from the 2 points of view, being that different things happened for the 2 parts.I remember when Figo's transfer took place, although it was crazy that changing the team from Barcelona to Real Madrid, I had not been aware of all the backstage that happened in between.Sure because at that time there were no social networks or anything.Nor had I realized at the time when Figo went to sign, his state of mind seems to be very bad.It sure wasn't easy for him to take that step. I remember the time of Real Madrid, he was the first galáctico.",False
10,10,Crazy,miguelbondesousa,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the most iconic transfer of all time, it's crazy to see the point of view of all people involved. What makes someone to go from Barça to Real the way he moved? The answer is in this documentary after 20 years.",False
11,6,Figo's Unforgettable Move,AkiBariKou,n/a,16/08/2025,"I still remember how shocking Figo's transfer was. This film is fascinating because it reveals the truth behind his move from Barcelona to Real Madrid-a truly surprising decision. As a superstar, Figo found himself in a situation that was increasingly out of his control, yet in the end, he made the decision himself.Although it seems he was influenced by many external factors, he believed he chose his own path, and I felt his inner strength in that. I truly respect how he took full responsibility for his actions.I was also amazed by how passionately so many people dedicate their lives to football. This movie reminded me once again that football really is the number one sport in the world.",False
12,10,A sports story like no other,ntrkpt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Football is a sport like no other, embedded in the history and culture of city's, it brings together and divides people like nothing else of its make. Amazing to see how transfers and speculation took place in the 90s and how one of the greatest betrayals in football history unfolded.Also great to see Perez, Guardiola and others openly talk about their truth. Figo about his own. Somehow years later the stories still don't match which is absolutely insane.Must watch for football fans and non football fans. 10/10 for me personally, never seen such a good football documentary and what a story to tell.",False
13,4,Lies and money!,genesis_friends,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerEveryone explainis ""their truth"". Whereas Veigas states that Figo knew about the agreement, he denies it. Florentino says there was no contract, Futre and Veigas say otherwise. Figo did not want to leave even though he says that everything was about ""feeling the respect and love from the club but he was offered FOUR times what he was making and Futre ends up confessing that he told Figo ""money is the most important at the end"".Figo was an idol, was the capitan of a team, had a three year contract and he blackmailed Barça. You can tell he tries to ""excuse himself"" but what he did was despicable and in Madrid his is one of the ""galacticos"", one of the bunch. For us is THE TRAITOR.He lies, Florentino lies, and arguably the worst president in Barça history seems to be the only one to tell the truth.",True
14,10,"Splendid, Remarkable, emotional.",Mustafa-alabasy,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the best documentaries about football ever made.The direction is great, the speech very good.. Figo is awesome.A lot of great information about Perez, and Real Madrid election.. and why Perez is the best president in history and his genius ideas.Overall very enjoyable.",False
15,8,Pure greed,spunkeren-59752,n/a,16/08/2025,"I dont mind people making alot of money, but for me football is passion, and figo is just pure greed. Very good story about how some people really are.",False
16,8,Loved it!,TreeFiddy53,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is sports documentary filmed like a heist drama (because it kinda sorta was a heist?), and boy did I enjoy watching this!You probably know about Figo's transfer from Barcelona to Real Madrid (a cardinal sin to many) but I believe this is the first time EVERYBODY involved are getting together to talk about their version of the truth, even Florentino Perez.This doc gives you some insight into why football is more than a sport, but this time, from a political, business and cultural standpoint.Whether you know this story or not (especially if you don't know about the details) you HAVE to watch this because this is literally the transfer was the cornerstone to Perez's Galácticos and everything that happened at RMA since then is history.Side note, i LOVED the background score in this doc, something you'd not care about in content like this but it added so much to the tension.Would totally recommend, perhaps even if you don't know the sport.",False
17,n/a,Very interesting to see things from this perspective,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This provides a fresh perspective on the events. It's common practice for the media to use transfer rumors as click bait by spreading untruths.I believe that your perspective would have changed if you were in Figo's shoes. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what's best for yourself. If you want to be happy, you get to decide....and if you're not happy, you just go somewhere else. With Perez at the helm, it appears that Madrid has a well-defined plan for the future of the club. Previous presidents of their organization have also done an excellent job of leading it.This is the way an official football team should be managed. I believe that every goal Perez set for himself he has accomplished to the fullest extent possible.To sum up, a solid documentary.",False
18,4,Luis Figo Sold Himself Again!!!,enjozsef,n/a,16/08/2025,"He is a traitor. A liar. This movei isnt show nothing new. Its a documentary? For what? To show what? What this movie want? I dont understand. He just want to clean himself, with more lie. This documentary isnt want to show what happend behind, isnt get any good information, what just realy happend. Ah yeah. We know MONEY. But what Figo want? MONEY. Nothing more. Just look how he looks. 49 years old, and looks like 6o..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................",False
19,10,Mindblowing,arenagianluca,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is hard to grasp, a person of this caliber, that legendary career, tell this story like the way he did during this documentary.Not only, did it bring context, but it brought the main personalities involved. I mean, you have, of course, Figo, but also, his agent, Barcelona President, Real Madrid President, club team mates of both BFC (Pep) and RM (Roberto Carlos), the media personalities that covered the event...Truthfully, he doesn't weave the story, he encapsulates it around Florentino Perez candidacy, probably the greatest President of the 21st century, showing how he kept poise and certainty in times of high speculation.Figo does not sugar coat it, he is honest. It has a timeline, and you revisit his point of view. What happened - as much as he could document it and legally open - he did. Doesn't matter how you perceived it, might've even not changed your perception, but the way he lays it out, its football history. It changed the course of Barcelona and Real Madrid, in the early 2000s.What makes it a 10 is the ability to bring the counter parts together, to get declarations from both presidents, to put himself again under the same paradox he faced during that transfer window, and not being even able to answer today what he couldn't answer 20 somewhat years ago. That level of transparency.To those who say its about the money. Its not about the money. The dichotomy of the rivalry is indeed what troubles him. There is a scene where he signs with RM, and Florentino presents him to the club, his face is priceless ""did I just do this?""It absolutely changed football. I don't think we have seen such a shocking transfer since, and the entire way the perception of the limits of building a team we're perceived changed. Galaticos, MSN, BBC, MNM ... the idea you can take out a central player from another team, a player that has the former clubs intentions for a long term project (and in this case to a rival team!), to rebuild around him, to impact club football and to win everything after was proven correct.How do clubs value their players? How are their relationships? Do they cater to the individual putting their bodies day in and day out, or do they see them as a mean to an end. This doc has nuance.Florentino wanted Figo, to put Real Madrid at the top. Figo understood that vision, had leverage, and at that point yearned approval (not from the fans, but from the board, which is ultimately who he wanted perceived value from.)Mind you, he's in his twenties, he's a young adult ... Money was never going to be an issue. All these pre contracts, pre signings, are all ways to make a player (who is supposed to be focused in his game, and his body) have a natural human ponderation of: ""wait a second, this crazy guy over here, believes in me so much, doesn't care about the figures ... is he right?""This same President had Zizou as a manager, back to back to back champions leagues, after a massive hurdle that was winning la décima with Cristiano (and Ancelotti?) after the Pep era with Barcelona.Its as honest as he can be. Moments of silence in between questions they still don't have answers, and they might never have. Thrilling.Winning in football is not normal. On paper, it can seem like an advantage, but we are humans.This is an absolute gem.Cherry on top Catalunya and Spanish history lesson.",True
20,8,First great moving in football,danielcereto,n/a,16/08/2025,I remember to live this transfer as if it was yesterday. I can't believe this was more than 20 years ago.As a Real Madrid teen supporter around 2000 I lived this one on the sweet side. This is the most greatest thing I lived apart from watching my team winning several champion's league finals.The documentary explains everything with exactitude. Around 90% it's true. Try to guess the 10% it's not. Interesting.,False
21,8,"Very good, factual documentary",carneirolaura-48106,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was in my teenage years when the transfer took place and it is very interesting to watch a documentary with all the parties involved.As a football fan, I cannot condone that a historical player goes to the archenemy. There are so many clubs out there he could have gone to if he really felt unappreciated.It does seem that he was bullied into signing that contract, especially with his agent being threatened to pay 30 mil to Real if Figo doesn't sign.However, as the documentary points out, Barça is more than a football club, it's also the symbol of a region and a political statement.Unfortunately, money seems to win all the time and ruin it for us, lovers of the beautiful game.",True
22,4,Figo is believable,elspamobasura,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary appears to be factual but is very boring. In part, perhaps, because we know the ending even before the movie begins. It's valuable in that it documents soccer history in the best league in the world, Spain. Of all the ""parties"" involved in the transfer, Figo is by far the most credible. He appears to be a serious man. Hats off to Florentino for convincing Figo to leave a club, in only one meeting, where the fans loved him but senior management was a bit distanced from their very own franchise player.Barca has since recovered but they paid the price dearly for a good number of years given their lack of championships.",False

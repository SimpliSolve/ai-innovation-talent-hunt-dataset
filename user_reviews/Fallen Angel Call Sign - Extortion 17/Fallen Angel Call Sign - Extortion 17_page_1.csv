1,10,Memories of Seal Team 6 Stronger Than Ever!,hines-2000,n/a,15/08/2025,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DOCUMENTARY! Extortion 17 meticulously delineates the Obama administration lies and deception as their unmitigated disaster metastasizes. Joe Biden knew that the classified information he illegally gave in public would be lethal to Seal Team 6. The Taliban immediately put a $50,000 bounty on each of their heads. All the criminal planning of events leading up to the Chinook helicopter being shot down are chronicled in explicit detail. Also, some of the many questions posed are an even greater mystery today: 1. Why did the military do a 180 on the Black Box narrative after being exposed for the fake flood story? 2. Why were Afghan fighters with the Seal Team and also switched at the last minute? 3. Why were the rules of engagement changed to protect the Taliban fighters? 4. Why was Seal Team 6 used on a QRF flight? 5. Who did the autopsy and why did he destroy the evidence?I loved the many great interviews from the service members and families of the fallen heroes. Also featured is Don Brown a former JAG officer who authored, ""Call Sign Extortion 17: The Shoot-Down of SEAL Team Six."" To help the children and families of these heroes, now more than ever I want to be a part of and contribute to the Vaughn family's Operation 300.",False
2,1,Meh,keeleylowe,n/a,15/08/2025,"The story itself is tragic, but tons of war propaganda. They start the movie showing George W Bush saying that after 9/11 we will hunt down those responsible. They fail to mention it was Saudis who orchestrated 9/11, yet he elected to go after Iraq and Afghanistan.",False

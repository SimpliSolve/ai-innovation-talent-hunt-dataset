1,8,Humanizes the bottom of the desert dwellers,salmon62,n/a,16/08/2025,"This a very good documentary about the poor people and children who occupy Quartzite, Arizona's BLM camping areas.Similar desert profiles have been done on Slab City, and the Salton Sea communities with similar demographic populations of retired and poor people.""One Road to Quartzite"", however, illustrates the plight of the itinerant poor kids who are dragged around by their parents. Its clear these kids suffer socially and academically, and have mental and physical health issues.The kids featured have created a fantasy world that helps them cope with the itinerant
lifestyle their parents have subjected them to.I like that the director and creator gave the poor kids a platform for their filming and their unique cinematic vision. Hats off to you!Its also nice that the director just let people talk free-form and allowed for silent interludes.In summary, this is a very good and interesting documentary on the desert and the people who are barely making it day to day. Its interesting that while the personal stories demonstrate poverty and daily hardships, I didn't hear much complaining from the children or other residents of the camp.",False
2,6,A bit oddly presented and uneven in parts.,etann-36707,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's mostly the style that got on my nerves a bit. One particular part that bothered me and is a good example of the style of storytelling that just felt unnessesary was the scene where there is a launromat and a stuffed animal is being washed, the washing cycle seams to end after various cuts of this scene gets spliced all over the place then this odd ""music"" is playing it's less music and more a contrived sound effect. Then cuts to a scene where this person is cleaning up a horrible mess of styrofoam pellets that eventually leads to a scene of these pellets in slow motion twirling about on the floor. Ok, to start why not use the hum of the washer/dryer as the background sound instead of this eerie odd noise effect, it would have tied the scene to what you're actually watching. Next, why romantisize in a way this person creating a horrible mess by doing something that should have been obvious was a bad idea. There certainly was footage of the fiasco that wasn't very flattering and maybe even hostile, this person had to get a broom and a large garbage bin to clean up this mess and was certainly more amusing than what was depicted here. There were other scenes of pointless slow motion and odd ""music"" choices that made me skip ahead a few times. And overall it had a very morose and stagnant feel to scenes that should have been depicted more lively and inspirational. So the overall tone was for me a perpetual downer this space has become although the intro and historic tone was that of an oasis in the desert for wanderers and libertarian minded individuals. Although you see generational stories throughout, the middle aged and young adult stories were less present although this is what the face of this place will eventually become. So it didn't have a passing of the torch moment I would have suspected to see, it was very much more like you could cover this place with a layer of dust and that would be the end of this place after the credits roll. But I suspect it will continue to be a safehaven for many to come and I would have liked if they did some work to seek out more people other than drug addicts and wanderers in this middle of the road group of people. Some people certainly go there for the peace and tranquilty of the desert life who don't have tragic stories to tell who have more positive outlooks on life. I don't feel they put together a full tapestry of the inhabitants here, if they did it was not a place I'd enjoy visiting, might as well visit a mosoleum or an old folks home anywhere else in the country.",True
3,10,Other-worldly,Sil-Azevedo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. What director Ryan Maxey was able to accomplish here is nothing short of miraculous. Quartzsite, AR is a town of 2400 people, in the middle of nowhere halfway between Phoenix and LA. Every year, over a million RVers and nomads flock there to escape the cold up north and the vicissitudes of life everywhere. The result of this unlikely confluence is an otherworldly community that reminds me of a Wes Anderson movie -- except for this is real.This documentary, shot in observational style by someone who knows the community very well, is a delight to watch. Superb cinematography coupled with masterful storytelling bring the community to life, and what a community this is. From old folks driving their RVs and flying their model airplanes to meth addicts trying to find a way out, the people in this camp are authentic, eccentric and lovely in their own way. Distinctively American and universal at the same time. What a film!",False
4,10,Compelling look at mental illness,pmvsjmbny,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's one thing to choose to live that way if you are an adult and I can respect that. But to have children and force them to live without bathing, brushing teeth, etc. That is selfish and abusive. Those children have no idea how to take care of themselves and apparently no one cares enough to teach them. This documentary is raw, it is thought provoking, and I feel sorry for the animals and children there. If you don't have a heart before watching, hopefully you will have one after. To all of the adults out there with children, please put your children FIRST. They didn't ask to be here. Get over yourself and give your children a home. One can only hope the child that wrote and filmed this piece will continue to make films and be recognized for his talent.",False

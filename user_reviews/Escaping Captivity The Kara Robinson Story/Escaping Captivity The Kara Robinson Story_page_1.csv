1,9,Inspiring story about a strong willed girl,topsi91,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was an interesting documentary, the little actress they chose was pretty and there were similarities in the looks. The story itself sound so unreal, what a lucky coincidence for her to manage to escape before being killed. It's inspiring story about how Kara turned her life around for the better and tried to take the best out of such a terrible situation. I like stories about survivors, you could also tell how much her ex boyfriend still loves her in his own way... I wish the lifetime movie (that I am about to watch) was with the girl from this documentary. And Kara? Kara is a strong, brave woman. Her 2 little boys are so cute. All the best to her.",False
2,10,Gotta Love Lifetime,marq_bryant,n/a,15/08/2025,"It brought a tear to my eye so it's a an automatic 10. Based on a true story with a few differences from what actually happened, yet spot on overall. I hadn't heard of the story before watching the movie which is what made it an even better experience. Acting was well done and what you'd come to expect in these kind of films dealing with kidnapping/ rape,etc and as a parent myself you can feel the anxiety in what you would go through ever having to go through such a situation.I can't stand giving spoilers so I won't go into exactly what happens, but the execution of the film is well and worth the hour and a half investment.",False

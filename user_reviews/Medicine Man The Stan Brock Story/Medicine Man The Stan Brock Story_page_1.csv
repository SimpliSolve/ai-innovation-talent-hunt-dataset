1,10,Fantastic guy remarkable story,johnawbrock,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the story of one Englishman who was variously a Cowboy and Ranch Manager in British Guyana, a naturalist, a TV wildlife presenter, and a film star Finally he founded a medical charity and spent the last 34 years of his life dedicated to the provision of free medical care for those in need.
The film is about his amazing life and is an inspiration to all.",False
2,9,What we are capable of,longcornerand,n/a,16/08/2025,Stan Brock represents what we are all capable of. His humanity is an example I can only aspire to.I'm proud to be a volunteer and donor to this great organization.Close Captioning is not available on this film.

3,8,Heartwarming inspirational film,emmamac-89229,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at a film festival recently and just had to leave a review! Stan's story is fascinating, and his compassion truly heartwarming. This film often plays more like a narrative feature than a documentary. Although it can be difficult to watch the suffering at RAM clinics, this is something that every American needs to see. There is also lots of wonderful archive from Wild Kingdom and Stan's time in the Amazon, which provides a bit of relief so the film does not feel too heavy. We need more people like Stan today, hopefully his story will inspire others to do good!",False
4,10,Awesome Documentary Film,holisticalameda,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this film online as part of the Bay Area's Cinequest Film Festival a couple of years ago. It was moving and reminds us about the incredible importance of true heroism, trust, community and capacity for generosity in an age of rampant truth-twisting from big business and politics. This enigma of a man at the film's center reminds us how much visionaries matter, as Brock assembles teams of medical professionals willing to assuage the health struggles of the third world's--and the first world's--ailing poor. An indictment of self-satisfaction and optimistic ignorance, an awesome film. Look forward to seeing it again on the big screen with big sound on November 14th as part of Fathom Events.",False
5,8,Brock was a humble hero,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. You know how an overachiever can make you feel like a worthless slug? Well, that's nothing compared to how you'll view yourself once you learn the story of Stan Brock. If you recognize the name, it's likely due to the 31 episodes of ""Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom"" he co-hosted with the legendary Marlin Perkins. His matinee idol good looks were right at home in the desert or wrestling an Anaconda in the Amazon. Documentarian Paul Michael Angell gives us Brock's backstory, but the focus here is on what he's done since.The film was completed in 2020, two years after Mr. Brock passed away. Despite playing some festivals, the film is just now gaining some well-deserved traction. We learn of his childhood, and how at age 17 he began working at the Dadanawa Ranch in British Guiana (now Guyana). He was a barefoot vaquero (cowboy), and clearly excelled in the no-frills close-to-nature environment, as he was supervising men much older than he. He later co-hosted the TV series, made three movies, wrote three books, and ultimately sold his belongings and founded RAM - Remote Area Medical in 1985.Much of the film details RAM operations and how Brock coordinates much, along with the assistance of the organization's long-time director, Karen Wilson. We are along for some of the ""expeditions"". The first one was in Mexico, and Brock's last was number 957, although RAM has since far exceeded that number. Providing free medical treatment for folks with no insurance and little money, means things like dental work and necessary x-rays can be handled, and if you doubt how crucial this service is, we learn that people in desperate need of tests and care will camp out for three days in hopes of receiving treatment.Mr. Brock was not a medical professional, and he certainly wasn't a glory-hound. In fact, he admits to poor social skills (he had to learn to hug) and a distaste for asking people for money. He gives credit to the tens of thousands of volunteers who made RAM a success. We do learn that many states have laws preventing doctors from crossing state lines to provide free medical care, and Mr. Brock succeeded in convincing twelve states to change this law so that more doctors could help.Stan Brock dedicated the last phase of his life to providing healthcare to those who needed it most. He did this despite his own personal health issues. His inspirational legacy is a shining example of community service and altruism. His was selfishness in a world that barely recognizes it ... well, except for those most appreciative folks (over one million now) who received treatment. If we are to idolize heroes, it should be people like Stan Brock who sacrificed so much for so many - even if his efforts make us feel like a worthless slug.Fathom Events for one night only on November 14, 2023.",False
6,10,Exception Man Who Led By Example,alma-smiles,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cannot say enough about Brock. I watched him when I was young on Wild Kingdom. Why didn't I know what he was doing for Healthcare? Why do people have to die for us to know what exceptional humans they are?I hope the documentary shows how southern, rural areas need so much help. I hope they stop voting against their own best interests. I hope more people donate to this great cause.I loved how the film gave us insight into his upbringing, which was very sad, his time in the Amazon, and his founding of RAM.Brock was an angel living among us. We see his despair. We see his humbleness. We see his humanity.I cannot say enough good things about this wonderful man.Every American should watch this documentary.",False
7,10,emotional and inspirational,tom_kington,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this last night, found it both inspirational and engaging.A really curious and unusual protagonist with an almost unbelievable backstory. Aided by the fact extraordinary vintage footage exists of his past exploits.What a mystery he is! He created through sheer force of character and charisma an inspirational charity that helps millions. Jaw dropping stuff really.Feel sad and outraged by US healthcare, but also hopeful and delighted at the lengths some go to help others in need whihc is truly life affirming.Plus it features Anaconda wrestling! What's not to like.Brilliant, I heartily recommend it.",False
8,10,Medicine Man: A Journey of Compassion and Healthcare Reform,nnieves-51697,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMedicine Man: The Stan Brock Story is an impactful documentary that traces the extraordinary life of Stan Brock, a man who dedicated himself to providing healthcare access to underserved communities across the U. S. Originally known for his adventurous life in the Amazon, Brock shifted his focus after witnessing the medical challenges in rural and impoverished areas, founding Remote Area Medical (RAM) to address these gaps. The film highlights Brock's journey from a lone volunteer to leading a nationwide organization, inspiring viewers with his compassion and dedication. Through heartfelt stories, the documentary captures the lives transformed by RAM's pop-up clinics, where thousands receive free medical, dental, and vision care. Directed with a compassionate lens, Medicine Man is both a tribute to Brock's legacy and a call to action for a more inclusive healthcare system. It's a moving portrayal of how one person's vision and resilience can impact countless lives, showing the enduring power of empathy and grassroots activism.",True
9,10,The impact of medical care is limitless,jelake-47949,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie and Stan Brock himself are inspiring. He saw such a massive need and took it upon himself to do something about it.The impact RAM and Stan Brock have had is incredible. He was able to put together an organization of driven and dedicated people willing to work to help others and do so much good in the world. Stan Brock's backstory just makes what he's accomplished even more inspiring. The old clips, as well as the footage from current times piece together the heartfelt mission that is Remote Area Medical. This movie pulls as the heart strings of the viewers and captures your attention. Such a good movie that most will enjoy and everyone will walk away from in awe!",False

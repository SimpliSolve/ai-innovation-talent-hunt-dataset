1,8,Tough but compelling,atmvawser,n/a,16/08/2025,"Now this is what I call a horror film.Even if I hadn't had a massive teenage crush on Dokic at the time, this galvanising account of her eventual triumph over dad Damir's physical/mental abuse (and emotional blackmail) would almost certainly have ripped my heart out and emptied my tear ducts.(You'll also, most likely, get at-least a couple of incredulous, hollow laughs from the discovery of just how unhinged that man could get.)
Some of the 're-enactment' footage strikes a briefly naff false note, but that really is nitpicking.This is a very well assembled piece of documentary moviemaking, and one well worth a cinema visit.",False
2,7,"A harrowing true story, conventionally told",YARDCG,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rating this documentary is a little difficult. On one hand, it unfortunately offers absolutely nothing new or inventive in terms of filmmaking. Unlike the other Australian sports documentary I saw in 2024, A Horse Named Winx, you'll be hard-pressed to find any visual flair, and it generally recounts the story at its core in what feels like the most standard manner possible.On the other hand, the story it focuses on deeply compelling - for terribly wrong reasons. A harrowing tale of how hard it is to break out of an abusive family and to avoid making obviously wrong decisions with so much pain on the other side of the ledger. It is also the tale of the aftershocks left behind - and of the willingness of so many to turn a blind eye as long as they can benefit.Arguably the most shocking scene is not of any physical abuse - but a completely real Kia ad where they chose to glorify the violent outburst of Jelena's father Damir at a foreign restaurant, recasting it as a righteous anger of an everyman who knows when he is ripped off - and when he is offered best value. This episode also highlights just how good things got for Damir at the time - and how he was unable to quit while ahead, presumably thinking that if he was able to abuse his daughter into becoming the global #4, nothing would stop her from getting to #1.Thus, the same behaviour which drove his family so far (at a horrific expense) also made him dissatisfied with what would have been beyond his wildest dreams only a few short years earlier, and ultimately got him to torch everything. In that sense, he is a disturbing parallel to too many other people you can probably think of on your own, and you may well be left with disturbing questions no film like this could answer.",False
3,10,An amazing inspiration,linda-glass,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cried throughout this wonderful documentary film. Jelena is an inspiration and her story as heartbreaking as it is needs to be told. I resonate with alot Jelena went through and she is a great human being regardless of her struggles, many would have been broken but not Jelena! She's a courageous and loving human who inspires many. Everyone should see this film, had me on the edge of my seat. Be warned bring tissues, it's a wonderful watch, a must see. I don't give many titles of film 10s but this one thoroughly deserved it, it's inspired me to keep going and to never give up no matter what. Thank you Jelena!",False

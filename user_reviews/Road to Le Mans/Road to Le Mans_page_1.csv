1,8,thoroughly enjoyable,johncg25,n/a,15/08/2025,"The stakes are not exceedingly high here, as Micheal Fassbender has a day job. But once it gets going, its actually quite an enjoyable watch, as it shows you essentially what it is like to race in Le Mans. Also includes lots of 1st person footage from the car, which makes it a pretty exciting watch at times. So for people who both A. Like Micheal Fassbender and B. Like racing in any way, they will probably enjoy this. (I do not watch any professional racing at all, simply enjoy most racing movies I have seen....this does a great job showing kindof what it is really like.) The sound is also extremely good, and really gets you into the action...it kept my attention and made me keep watching...even if we know Fassbender doesn't ""need"" to win to have a life.",False

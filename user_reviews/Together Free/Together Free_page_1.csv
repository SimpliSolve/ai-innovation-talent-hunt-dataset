1,6,Interesting with some question marks,AmsterdamViewer,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerInteresting travel report of two German friends walking the Himalaya trail while they talk about their friendship.I'm surprised it's on Netflix because the quality of the film is not that good, they filmed everything themselves and they are not professional filmers, but nevertheless interesting and good enough to watch. Beautiful shots of the Himalaya make me want to go there too.At some point though the story becomes kind of repetitive and the constant same female singer songwriter background music gets on my nerve. In the later added voice over they talk about friendship a lot, but in the sparse conversations during their trip it never comes up. It would have made it more interesting to watch.At the end I was surprised that clearly their luggage was partly carried by two Nepalees carriers that joined them on their trip but were never filmed.",True

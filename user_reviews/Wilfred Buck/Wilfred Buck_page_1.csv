1,10,DOXA 2024 - Wilfred Buck,kdebock-77448,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the pleasure to watch WILFRED BUCK at its sold-out Vancouver premiere at DOXA 2024.After the screening, filmmaker Lisa Jackson (in person) and Wilfred Buck (Zoom) joined a Q&A with host Selina Crammond for an interesting and entertaining discussion about the making of the film.What I admire about Jackson and Buck, both stalented storytellers, is their ability to share their knowledge - Indigenous, cultural, historical and scientific - in an engaging, entertaining and visually exciting way.In the spring and summer of 2024, the film will be available at select theatres and communities through the National Film Board of Canada's theatrical and community distribution.You should try to watch it if you can. Jackson and Buck will attend select events.Press quotes:
""Anishinaabe writer-director Lisa Jackson has made a documentary that lives and breathes. . . This doc is a wild and thoughtful ride that shows the knowledge of our ancestors will never be lost as long as we are looking in the right places."" - Lucius Dechausay, CBC Arts""Jackson's profile of star gazer and brilliant speaker Wilfred Buck is an engaging, startling piece."" - Marc Glassman, POV Magazine.",False

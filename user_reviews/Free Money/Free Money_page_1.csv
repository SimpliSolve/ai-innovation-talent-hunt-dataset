1,8,It may not work for everyone but it will work for some. Be still 2031 is near,bironautoo,n/a,15/08/2025,"For me I think this is a very good initiative that give direct is experimenting or trying out on a certain population in Kenya. For someone like Larry to go about bashing the experiment when it's barely halfway through is premature. And in life nothing will ever be fair and that is the truth. So if a few people can benefit from something that the rest of us are not giving unto them, we should allow it to happen. They have the choice to be part of it or not. And Kenya has a government that can decide to safeguard its people if it's so chooses. Everyone was about 18 years old and they really did not have to accept the money. So I say kudos to give direct and I really hope that the people of the village use those resources to actually develop themselves and hope this so-called A/B works. You don't work for everyone but it will work for some.",False

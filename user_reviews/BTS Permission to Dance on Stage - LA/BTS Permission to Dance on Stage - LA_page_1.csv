1,10,Did you really watch the whole show?,aliashere,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pulling off the best they could that no one could ever done for 3 years of complicated countermeasures and many other obstacles throughout, BTS had finally came to ease their fans' emptiness after those months of patience within uncertainties. This is BTS's first offline concert since the 'LOVE YOURSELF: SPEAK YOURSELF THE FINAL' in Seoul in 2019. Throughout the concert, BTS not only delivered performances that were pleasing to both the eyes and ears, but also to the audience.BTS is rightfully deserved the amount of appreciation on this one for had successfully attracted as much as 813,000 spectators, including: 214,000 people watched the 4 nights of live performances at SoFi Stadium, 18,000 people watched the 'Live Play in LA' event at the YouTube Theater near the SoFi yard; 581,000 people bought tickets to stream online on the last night of the concert. In total, BTS' concert 'PTD ON STAGE LA' is estimated to earn 33.3 million USD, excluding sales of goods and online stream tickets.The sold-out tickets for all 4 shows at SoFi, is the highest number of tickets sold in the history of this stadium. It is the highest-grossing show at a single venue in the last 10 years globally (the last time someone did this was when Roger Waters kicked off nine shows in 2012 in Buenos Aires, Argentina).P.s. I will never interested to any start of argument if you're doubted about the quality of performance because let's just be real and watch the whole performance on Disney h+. It's BTS you're all about to questioned. They were facing 50,000 audience per day, the first time again to experience a close-interaction with the ARMYs after 3 years, it's probably the most exhausting and challenging festival they'd ever faced, but they nailed the all-7-members setlist (songs) with their dedicated performances and musical intelligence, solely to give equal experience towards all the fans attended there, and all the members to see their fans eye to eyes once more.So, for any of you virialized others to hate these talented guys by leaving 1-star on the ratings, good luck with your own idols/fave artists because if any ways you thought to unrecognize BTS standard in music industry, it will in return, only got you less than unrecognized pathetic ones in the end.. Swallow reality and accept that it's always been BTS who paved the way‚úåüèª",False
2,10,It's amazing,raneemelsawy,n/a,16/08/2025,The show is one of the best shows I've ever seen since Michael Jackson their dancing is amazing and their voices are perfect not forgetting how beautiful the stage was set their fans were so organized with these beautiful light sticks in conclusion it's perfect. So if you want to watch shows like the ones Michael Jackson has been doing from perfect dancing to perfect vocals this show is the best one for you.dont forget to put on subtitles cause their songs has beautiful and comforting lyrics it will make you feel better and forgetting about the bad things that happened along your day. Don't forget to give them a good preview if you watched it and i suggest another shows like bon voyage and run bts they are amazing and funny.,False
3,10,Incredible!,jeannine_bullis,n/a,16/08/2025,"These were such amazing concerts, the pandemic kept everyone from live shows so when they were finally able to return, they really gave it their all and it shows! No one does it like BTS-they are sincere, hardworking and care so much for their fans! Their opening song is one we ALL have been waiting to see (I won't tell you what it was, I don't want to spoil it for anyone) for so long!I saw young fans and older fans (dope old ARMY) alike in the audience and I would encourage anyone with an open mind to listen to their music as they have something for everyone, you will be surprised at how much you like them, they don't disappoint.",False
4,10,PTD:LA,oriannajosefinabolivarpacheco,n/a,16/08/2025,What can I say? They are incredible artists that each time show what they are made of and all that they have achieved throughout their career. Over the years they have inspired so many and erased the language barrier with the music they create. I am very proud of them. They make you feel part of something amazing that inspires you to be better and to fight for your dreams. That you never settle and that if you fall once you get up and keep working on your dreams. They are very genuine artists who are always aware of what is going on around them. They are always looking to improve and to give a voice to those who need it.,False
5,10,WOW!,nolancathy-68423,n/a,16/08/2025,So ive seen and heard alot about BTS on the Internet but never really had the time to check them out . I saw this pop up on my Disney plus and said id have a look to see what all the fuss was about. I've never been to a concert before but my god if this is what concerts are like sign me up. The singing the dancing the rapping they had it all. You can tell they were born to be on stage. Im amazed! Blue and Grey was beautiful. Black Swan was magical. Dynamite and Butter were so much fun :) I was happy they had subtitles on the concert because their songs have alot of meaning and some beautiful words. I will for sure be watching this on repeat. Im a new fan for sure :),False
6,10,Incredible,monerose,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such an awesome concert - the singing, the dancing and the whole vibe was incredible!!!! It's filmed well so is the next best thing to being there in person! I cannot WAIT to go see them in person!I appreciated the subtitles on the bottom with good translations to the lyrics. I felt like it didn't take away from the concert experience to glance down and read them during the show.I also loved that it went behind the scenes as they went to do costume changes. It helped see how they rest and get psyched up to go back. They must have been exhausted!!I wish more concerts were like this = the whole package! üíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú",False
7,10,BTS BTS BTS,emukey,n/a,16/08/2025,Permission to Dance LA is a series of 4 performances that took place late 2021. This is a recording of Day 2 (November 29th 2021). This tour set was the first live audience performance post pandemic and it did not disappoint. Fans (Armys) travelled from all over the world to experience this together. This recording from Disney+ has excellent camera work that really shows off how dynamic amd sophisticated the performances were. Anyone can see that they are incomparable and this show is visually appealing as well as truly entertaining. Everything BTS does they do with their entire being. Its hard not to feel as if you're reliving the moment with them all over again. Definitely recommend whether you're an Army or just curious- they're wonderful people and artists. Disney+ provided 20+ language subtitles as well as song lyric translations!!!! Great job- enjoy this concert!,False
8,10,BTS: Permission to dance on stage- LA,hirohiroshima,n/a,16/08/2025,They did so amazing by bringing these experience on tt for the other audience to see who couldn't be present for the concert. I felt the rawness in their concert. The way they connect with their fans is amazing. This felt like I was actually present in the concert. I was crying at some point and then hyping and then screaming and then emotional. This was like a roller coaster ride of emotions totally best experience I've ever had. And the translation made it so easy to understand what they want to convey to the fans and to the whole world. Their speeches really touched my heart. I will definitely recommend this to my other friends and family. I'm sure they will love it. Thank you BTS and thank you to Disney+ for bringing this concert on tt.,False
9,10,IT WAS SURREAL,jhumbiswas,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was so beautiful to watch. I was in awe while watching them perform with their blood, sweat and tears. They were immaculate as always. BTS' concert will always be one of most beautiful concerts you'll ever get to see! Everything was so beautiful about the concert. ARMYs are one of the most beautiful fandoms. And it makes me proud to think that I'm one of them and we love our boys with our whole heart. They deserve it. They NEVER failed to make us feel special and did a splendid job at it as always. I'm so proud of my boys and will always be. They are one of the best things that happened to me and I can never thank them enough for that. We all love you, Bangtan. Only upwards and upwards. Keep shining my boys!üíú",False
10,10,A nice kickstart if you're curious about them,tearymoonchild,n/a,16/08/2025,"Experiencing BTS concert in person is one thing, sometimes it hards to capture in a documentary. However, they did them right on this one! The take on each performance, camera angles, and even providing subtitles to each songs? That's rare! I feel like whether you're a fan or not, you'll enjoy this and that way you'll know why they can be as big as they are right now. Through the help of the subtitles and their sincerity in performing, you'll know how they're not just making music but also carrying a mission. Each of their eras are carrying a different mission for the youth. An important message that needs to be heard.",False
11,10,No ones beats BTS when it comes to putting on a show,dorielbarochis,n/a,16/08/2025,"My family and I were one of the lucky attendees at LA and Las Vegas shows. BTS is one of the most energetic, sincere and charismatic artists I have ever seen on stage (and going to concerts is my guilty pleasure). Once you go to a BTS concert, no other will be able to match your experience. I just hope not only Armys, but also the general public give this show a chance, so that they can understand the reason for the great love and support that the boys receive all over the world. This show is also a good way to get to know the group's vast and varied discography. I love that not only their comments, but also the lyrics of their songs, were translated into different languages.",False
12,3,I'm 2 songs in and I hate it,dieseldog-42932,n/a,16/08/2025,"We go to concerts because we want to see a performance. All of it. We watch concerts on TV like this because we can't go. We want the concert experience though. There are 7 guys on that stage that dance amazingly! I would love to see that. The amount of close ups are ridiculous. There are enough close ups and pictures of these guys that we don't need that many. I can go watch the music video. I wouldn't mind seeing the dancers also.Then the second song. I don't think I've heard of a stadium concert using dark red lights before? So now they're hard to see at all. Even close up. I feel bad for the people actually at the concert. I don't know who edited this but it's beyond me why it's this way? It's a dance performance. Let us see them dance!I have nothing but good things to say about the boys. They did their job.If this doesn't get any better Disney, I'm gonna go find fan footage to watch so I can see the whole stage and watch all of the guys dancing together.",False
13,10,AMAZING show. Unbeatable.,matthewjk-91557,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was such an incredible concert. I can't believe that I was able to see such excellence onscreen. I'm really bummed that I couldn't go and see it live, but I am still so happy that this was available to watch on Disney Plus. They are having fun on stage singing their hearts out, while dancing to a lot of difficult songs. If the song is difficult or really high Tempo, they are still so happy to be on stage and you can see it on their faces. I am so amazed at this entire concert and I know I'm going to watch it many times. I don't know how they were able to go through the whole concert while doing group songs only. I know they usually used to do solo songs and it would give the other members of break. They went Full Source through the entire concert together and it was incredible to watch. Don't be afraid, give this a watch.",False
14,10,An amazing experience!!!,jenniferyawn,n/a,16/08/2025,"The video on Disney plus is so good! BTS are, of course, amazing!!!! The camera shots and quality are excellent!!!! Love the behind the scenes parts, too!!! I especially love that there are english subtitles for the songs as well as the speaking parts!!! The concert was very emotional since it was the first time BTS had been able to see Army (fans) in more than two years due to Covid-19. I cannot say enough good things about it! Grab some concert snacks and settle down in the living room with your family to experience Day 2 of the Permission to Dance concert in Las Angeles! You'll be so glad you did!",False
15,10,Let's jump together into the BTS rabbit hole,qfqtwwrp,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a 42-year-old health professional who discovered BTS during the pandemic. These seven beautiful souls have given me so much comfort and happiness in those difficult times. It all started with coming across the lyrics of one song and consuming more and more online content daily until I found myself deep down in the BTS rabbit hole.I watched the PTD Seoul concert via paid live streaming and enjoyed it so much that I did it again for PTD Las Vegas. There has never been any other music group that has gotten me so enthusiastic for live performances as BTS. By having the PTD LA concert on Disney+ has allowed me to relive the moment again and again.If you are reading this and not yet a fan of BTS or feel they are just another K-pop band, I urge you to put aside any judgement until you have watched this film. Read the lyrics provided in the subtitles, watch them perform at such high energy, and listen to their beautiful voices. At the end of the show, you would, by the very least, understand why BTS is the biggest group in the world and evoke so much love from their fans.",False
16,10,Unmatched entertainment value!,angiehenri,n/a,16/08/2025,"BTS put on an outstanding show that not only showcased their singing and dancing, but also the connection that they share with their fans. After an absence of live concerts for a few years, you can really see how much this meant to them, to be back in front of a live audience! The subtitles were a welcome addition.My husband who is a metalhead was really impressed with the show and said that it was one of the best performances he had ever seen, even though he didn't know the music. He very much enjoyed seeing all the ARMY bombs light up in synch and said that it definitely added to the experience. While obviously watching a concert on TV is vastly different from experiencing it in person, this is still worth watching. It captures the essence of what makes their live shows so incredible. Such a treat to find this on Disney +. If you haven't had the chance to check it out, you won't regret it!",False
17,10,Amazing doesn't even begin to cover it.,jkalman-35812,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't often watch concerts on TV. Usually I end up getting a little bored or I tend to just go on my phone or something. Liver for this concert, my eyes were stuck on the TV the entire time. Every moment of his concert was enjoyable and worth watching. I know that some people might not be fans of BTS, but you should really give this concert but try. You can see how much fun they have on stage, and their smiles are contagious in the best way. I hope to see them in concert one day. Anyway about the concert itself, the production value was out-of-this-world. The detail is so eye catching. You can tell that they did not just throw this concert together. They took the time to make sure that not only the people in the stands, but people like us were watching at home could enjoy to the fullest.",False
18,10,Top notch production and performance,diptibasnet,n/a,16/08/2025,Firstly the concert itself was amazing and full of great set lists and performances. Their energy was always high as usual and I couldn't take my eyes off them. The video quality is super nice and they have added subtitles even to the songs. Overall the experience of watching PTD was really really amazing. Showcasing backstage raw footage really put into prospective all the activities that go on the back of the scene to make the concert a success. ARMYs reaction and feelings to the songs and the words of BTS is really well captured. PTD in LA was a special concert for both BTS and their fans so being able to watch it over and over again in high quality and with subtiles is always an experience.,False
19,10,Best Concert Movie on the Internet,smoothlikekp,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was at this show so getting to see it on the big screen with all the added bonuses of the clear recording, behind the scenes, and more showing off their phenomenal dedication to their craft make this the best concert video that exists. I don't think there is anyone out there who could possibly watch this and not have an amazing time! If you are looking to get into BTS, this is a perfect introduction to the seven members and their huge variety of song genres and performances! The quality of the video is top notch and makes you feel like you are there! The only people hating on this release are those with pre-conceived notions of BTS and stereotype them as such. Don't listen to that negative energy and watch with an open mind!",False
20,10,MAGICAL,kzqxpfcq,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've lost track how many times I've watched this movie. It captures all the magic that the BTS men radiate when they perform. Everything about this film was executed perfectly. If anyone is curious to see what the hype around BTS is, I would have them start with this. Being able to have this concert encapsulated in 4K for me to watch at any given point to relive the happiness of seeing the boys perform in front of a cheering crowd after being stuck at home for so long during the pandemic... it's honestly such a privilege. Usually content of this caliber you'd have to pay a decent chunk of cash for. But the fact that it's part of my Disney subscription is honestly a privilege. 10/10 would recommend.",False
21,10,BTS Concerts are a MAGICAL EXPERIENCE,manisja-19018,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every BTS performance is totally mind-blowing & unique be it for stage, broadcast or concerts in major stadiums. The latter especially is an experience that every #BTSARMY needs to savour but for most seeing them on screen us just as magical. Thank you to Disney+ for having captions all throughout especially having the lyrics so everyone can understand the true meanings of their songs. Plus the HD 4k quality is *chef kiss*. There's the Las Vegas concerts too or Wembley concerts etc, they have a massive treasure trove, of stadium concerts, their documentaries etc, @DisneyPlus u won't regret it!!!",False
22,10,Wow!!! Fun for the whole family!,kcomeau-15417,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who frequently goes to concerts, I can say this is one of the best I have ever seen. The show is high energy from start to finish. The range of music is also unique and fully entertaining, each set list has its own interest and performance. The group are such high quality charismatic performers. They also sounded so great and had moments where they were adorable. It was fun seeing them interact as a group! Also, remember to set your subtitles, reading the lyrics added an enhanced element to the concert. Will definitely be rewatching. Family friendly with great music. One day I would love to see them in concert in person.",False
23,10,History in the Making,blueblueturtles,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you always wondered why it was BTS of all acts, - korean or international, to rise to the very top of the music world, this is the movie to watch. You need to see them do what they do best: perform live (yes, the mics are on) and you need to understand the lyrical debth in their music aside from the dyna-na-na of their three english titles.BTS are performers on a level we don't see anymore today. They love what they do and they are the very best at it. But aside from that, BTS' main lyricist, Kim Namjoon, is one of the greatest lyricists in pop history in general. BTS tell their own stories, overflowing with references to art and literature. Them writing in Korean instead of english obvioulsy poses a barrier to most people trying to form an opinion about this group but it doesn't have to be that way.Disney did a great job making this amazing live performance available WITH well translated korean lyrics.A unique chance to see history in the making and a great point to start if you always wanted to know what all the fuss is really about.",False
24,10,Amazing and wonderful. Bts the best forever,malago-24213,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love it, bts is the best and this show is amazing. Bts changed the world of the music, thanks them the people round the world know what is the K-pop.BTS fight day after day against discrimination and xenophobia. If instead of criticizing them, they would use that time to read the lyrics of their songs and learn a little about the history of these 7 wonderful boys, they would surely change their way of thinking.BTS in their lyrics conveys positive messages that help many people around the world to get ahead, regardless of breaking the language barrier and that's what counts.Listening to BTS is one of the best things that can happen to us music lovers.Let's keep fighting for a better world and more together with wonderful people like the 7 boys from Bts.",False
25,10,Amazing,diazjessica,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes! Well worth the watch and the time. It felt very surreal to watch this and it felt like you were there experiencing the entire concert while at your own home/theater. I highly recommend watching this and giving BTS a try if you have not yet. They are the biggest group in the world right now and this film shows it!!! Also the sound quality felt very nice too, it was very clear and precise editing that made me appreciate this even more than without it. There's other films too such as burn the stage and the bon voyage series that allow you to have a look into the Bts fandom and life and I recommend those too for people starting this.",False

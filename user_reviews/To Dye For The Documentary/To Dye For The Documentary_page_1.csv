1,6,Nothing new you didnt know,mariabrankovic,n/a,16/08/2025,"At this point I really dont understand parents who dont know how artifical food, drink, plastic, pesticides are changing not only kids but sterilise adults. And still in 2025 everybody are shocked how much adhd, autism, mental problems are among young... people wake up absolute everything today is poisining us, at this point only your own home grown food is exceptable and eatable... not only kids are more sick from food, they are more sensitive after all vaccines they get from birth... this is gonna be first generation that will live shorter than their parents and its all because of food, pesticides, vaccines, water, poisend air..",False
2,3,"Average simple doc, all 50 reviews are 10stars",Xavier_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc does a decent job of getting the info out there that there are artificial dyes that we should be aware of. It even starts naming them in the first few minutes and we also get a brief history of them and the FDA.Then is somehow just stops and goes into story mode. One mother's story after another and dropping tid bits from academics and is mostly filler for the 94 minutes of running time.You can easily skip through the stories and there is no data to back up anything. There is a blindfolded taste test which means nothing.The bottom line is that other countries have banned some of these chemicals from food while the US has not. In the end it asks us to call/write politicians who are lobbied by the massive food companies, which has been mostly futile since the 1960's when some of these chemicals were created.A poor documentary from a husband and wife team who are first time film makers.The 50 reviews are all from 1 review accounts giving it 10 stars. If only the film makers put the same effort into making their film as they did creating fake profiles maybe this would have turned out better. 3/10 for the first 5 minutes. Nothing new after that.",False
3,4,"Fine doc, needed an editor",LoafOfMidwestBread,n/a,16/08/2025,"I work in video journalism and this film reminds me of a lot of projects by new filmmakers who feel passionately on a topic - emotional stories, interviews on one side of an argument, the making of the film itself used as a narrative device (it was your son that was interesting, not your being new to the craft), a lack of new or groundbreaking information / footage, and longer than necessary. Which is fine; most filmmakers - newcomers and veterans alike - will fall into these traps. It's so easy to do. What most people need to avoid these is an editor, which I couldn't feel in this project (and by ""editor"" I don't necessarily mean the person who holds the mouse and controls the editing software - I mean someone who will ruthlessly force the filmmakers to cut the fat, to get outside their comfort zones, to break new ground or to find new information, and ask the filmmakers to examine their own biases (counter arguments are actually *good* for the credibility of a project, but it can be hard for an advocate to realize this)).The things I would've liked to have seen in this film: (1) discussion of the crackpot pseudoscience fringe who have attached themselves to this issue - has that hurt the cause? Give us a peek of the reality inside the movement. (2) An examination / explanation of how it can be that the FDA can ban something for external use but allow it for internal use. (3) Interviews with food industry folks: someone defending food dyes (""Americans want crazy-looking crap - what are we supposed to do??"") and/or someone who worked in the food industry at the time these dyes were taking hold and can offer us a peek behind the curtain. It would be especially cool to hear from someone who developed these dyes and tried to make them safe for kids....but failed. And most of all, (4) someone at FDA - either *currently* as a whistleblower, or *formerly* as a ""I can't believe I saw this go down""-type voice - who can provide either a smoking gun or provide info that shows how this is a profit-vs-people issue. I suppose the FDA interview could also be a humorous device when the person can't tell us why such toxic crap is allowed in our food. Oh and (5) less reliance on personal, tragic narratives. Some of this is absolutely needed, but such a huge issue that's been at-play for decades now should also have produced macro-sized data and big health trends that were missing from the film. Oh and (6), yeah, it doesn't look great that there are a bunch of 10-star reviews from first-time reviewers and the ""rate this"" score is around 6.It also would've been really cool to see your wife confront a food executive; moms with kids who've been harmed have the moral high ground 100% of the time.But kudos for getting a passion project into the form of a feature film. I hope it produces good things for your son. Much of the lighting and cinematography were really beautiful, and you found some very compelling personal stories.",False
4,10,Amazing!,celiajane-88370,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is necessary and relevant. It relatable and helps share an important message needed for the American food industry! It is so well done and understandable. My family champions this film and this movement! We are grateful for this family for only sharing their experiences to the world. My young boys are hopeful that this film will be what America needs to finally pull back on synthetic dyes! They would love to walk into a store, or ice cream shop and not be limited.Take the time to watch this film, educate yourself, synthetic dyes have so many negatives and no positives. You will not be sorry!",False
5,10,Insane.,roxlerookie,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a european finance professional, my mind went to warren buffet watching this. Knowing some of his holdings in staple US pantry items, i can't understand the absolute disregard for the end customer. These chemicals are known to be harmful, and have been for decades, yet industrial lobbies are actively fighting to keep using them, knowing full well it's detrimental to the health of customers.It's mind blowing to me, the level of carelessness and evil required as a company exec to go out of your way to fight to keep using cancer causing chemicals so your food can be brightly coloured. Insane.",False
6,10,Must warch,kellifleischhauer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sure! Here's a longer version of your review:This documentary was incredibly eye-opening and deeply impactful. The personal stories shared by moms were not only emotional but also highly relatable to so many people, especially parents who are trying to make the best choices for their families. Learning the truth about synthetic dyes was both shocking and concerning. I had some prior knowledge about the potential effects, but this film provided even more insight, motivating me to be much more mindful about checking food labels. It's alarming to see how many everyday products contain these additives. This documentary is a must-watch for anyone who cares about health and well-being. It raises important awareness about something that affects countless families, and I highly recommend it to everyone!",False
7,10,This. Is. Important.,kelseyschwertner,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thankful cannot express how I feel that many people decided to create this film! I hope this film gets approved for Netflix, Hulu, and everywhere else because its message is vital! It is life or death that parents learn about how toxic these dyes are! I have first hand experience of watching my children lose their minds after Easter or Halloween candy, I wish I would have learned WHY sooner! It was the dye! I cannot tell you how many parent called me crazy when I eventually would deny my children foods or candies with dye, I wish they knew everything in this film! Cannot recommend this film enough!",False
8,10,Fantastic and informative,kristinlorean,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a parent of a child who was hard to figure out, a child who was constantly inconsistent. This film hit the nail on the head! So many people thought we were crazy until they saw the change. It's unbelievable what they allow us to ingest! I love how simply put everything in the film was. It's all so easy to understand and just very informative. My seven year old wanted to watch it and was excited to know that he's not alone in how synthetic dyes make him feel. I would suggest watching it first before letting your child see it, just so you are aware of the topics to discuss. I have watched it several times now and it's so comforting to know my family isn't alone.",False
9,10,There's just too much evidence to ignore,kyfcbswgp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Both from personal experience and from the scientific research to back it up, there's just too much evidence to ignore. Synthetic dyes are harming us, and especially our children on so many levels. Here's the other point-even if they weren't harming us (though the evidence says differently), they certainly aren't helping us. So why are these poisons and carcinogens being put into our food? It's all a money grab, and unless we speak up and speak louder than the food industry, we will never make a change. This documentary validates the experiences of thousands of family across the nation, and it is well put together, moves at a great pace, and is incredibly inspirational. It's time to follow the calls to action and make a change.",False
10,10,Well made and engaging!,jnsavage-39908,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved the film! I watch a lot of documentaries and this one was really well made, well thought out and intentional. I am a functional health practitioner, a mom of four children, and at least one of those has a severe food dye sensitivity. I could relate to so much of the film. I really appreciate the producers putting this out! Its truly a gift to our population. So many people don't realize that other countries have banned artifical food dyes. Education is a huge step towards change, and this film does just that! If your child has confusing or unexplained behavioral issues, I highly recommend that you watch this film!",False
11,10,Reshaped my world view,rlharper-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"""To DYE For"" is a documentary that doesn't just expose hidden truths-it demands your attention. For me, its most eye-opening revelation was the alarming dangers of synthetic dyes, particularly Red No. 3. Before watching, I'd heard whispers about ""artificial additives"" being bad, but this film laid it all bare: the disturbing history of these chemicals, their pervasive presence in everyday foods, and their very real, often terrifying, effects on our health.Red No. 3, a dye banned in some applications but still used in many of our foods, became the villain of my pantry after watching. The documentary revealed its links to cancer in lab studies and its suspected role in triggering hyperactivity and behavioral issues in children. Hearing from families who watched their kids transform-going from calm and focused to irritable and erratic after consuming foods loaded with synthetic dyes-was heartbreaking and enraging. The science backed their stories, painting a chilling picture of how these dyes, created for aesthetics rather than nutrition, wreak havoc on vulnerable systems.The most unsettling part? These dyes are everywhere: in cereals, candies, snacks, and even so-called ""healthy"" foods marketed to children. Since watching, I've become hyper-aware of what's on ingredient labels and what's truly behind that enticing bright red or neon yellow. The documentary made me question why we prioritize visual appeal over health and why we're still allowing substances like Red No. 3 in our food when better, safer alternatives exist.""To DYE For"" didn't just reshape my perspective-it forced me to act. I've purged my kitchen of products containing synthetic dyes, sought out natural alternatives, and started conversations about this issue with friends and family. This isn't just about me anymore; it's about protecting the next generation and demanding better from the food industry.If you've ever wondered what's really in the food you eat-or more importantly, how it affects the people you love-this documentary is a must-watch. It's a game-changer, a myth-buster, and, quite frankly, a life-saver. Do.",False
12,10,Incredible!,uetzville,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely amazing documentary. Very eye opening to how the added dyes in food, drink and pharmaceuticals can truly affect the body in various ways. We have been a dye free house for about two years and notice a huge change in our kids' behavior. This documentary has helped our family and friends realize why we decided to start the dye free journey with our family and they have started to become more supportive after seeing this! This documentary was so well done and the real life testimonies from families just like ours brought tears to my eyes. I hope the entire world can see this amazing piece of art!",False
13,10,Must watch for child food safety!!',rachvaldez,n/a,16/08/2025,This film addresses so much concerns in the food industry with synthetic dyes. We need more advocation like this for our children in this country. Without this film there are not enough parents who know about the harm these dyes do. This film needs to get into as many homes as possible to help parents understand the concern with dyes in our food. We need parents to know what they are giving their children and let them decide if they want their children (and themselves) to ingest these harmful toxins. This film will help parents advocate for children who can't to it for themselves. It's a tool that will that is much needed.,False
14,10,Such an important film,combdenlaura,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is so important.It's heartbreaking to see so many parents, just like me, articulate the pain they felt before they made the connection between their children's mental health and the food dye.The Big Food lobbying groups have successfully managed to keep food dye in our food supply and our medicine for decades despite known proven harm. That's obvious.Let's hope this film is seen by the right people, and the mental health of our children is prioritized. With every violent episode in the United States, every ADHD diagnosis, I wonder.....could it be the food dye?The scientific evidence is there, and showcased by experts. The stories are heartbreaking, the history alarming. This should change how we look at food and medicine the way Supersize Me changed the way we looked at Fast Food.I'm in Canada and this film is just as relevant here as it is in the United States. Health Canada does exactly what the FDA does. Red 3 is still allowed, despite being banned in makeup due to the cancer risk decades ago.Unlike the US, there doesn't appear to be any provincial bans or regulations coming in, like they've seen in California.Share this film, so the right people see it.It could be your grandchild, your neighbour, or your child next.",False
15,10,Must watch,jdmiller-00951,n/a,16/08/2025,"After waiting months for this film to be released, it did not disappoint! I was crying in the first 20 minutes because I felt seen, heard, and validated. Until you experience a child with a synthetic dye sensitivity, it's hard to understand. I've also learned I am also sensitive to synthetic dye and now our family has answers to the chaos. This tool is incredibly helpful to spread awareness and show to our friends and family, who seemed to think we were exaggerating and being overprotective. So many times I heard ""let kids be kids"" and ""they're only kids once"". I understand childhood, however, the peace in our home and the effects for days on my child are not worth a dye covered cupcake. Here's the science of why.",False
16,10,Must see!!!,lesliemackun,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew artificial dyes were causing my child's moody behaviors but until this movie came out, nobody would listen to me. Each story told by the mothers resonated with me and what I didn't already know, I learned while watching this movie. Artificial colors are found in so much more than just our food and it does more harm than people realize. Everyone needs to wake up to what these additives are doing to our bodies. I think everyone should watch this movie and I'm so grateful that there is finally a documentary out so more people can have the knowledge of what color additives are actually causing.",False
17,10,Please Watch!,jbowen-68567,n/a,16/08/2025,So validating to watch something we have lived for the last several years on screen! I hope everyone takes some time to watch this and learn about the dangers of dyes! I have done tons of research in learning to feed my family but even I learned some things watching this. There is so much hiding in our food that can cause us harm! I wish this was available on even more platforms so more people had access to the education it provides! Thank you for the time and effort it took to bring this to light. It is much needed and I for one am extremely grateful for the opportunity to educate others with this! Well done documentary! Thank you!!,False
18,10,Must watch about the impacts of artificial dyes,megatieter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Our family has been dye free for 1.5years now and we have never felt so seen until we started following Dr Bevans (shown in the documentary) and the Cawood's story waiting for the documentary to release! All of the colors cause sever emotional and attention issues for my daughter (11) and myself (41) and have for our whole lives but we never realized how big an impact something so simple could have on our mental well-being. Now when we encounter those who doubt how real this is, we can refer them to this amazing compilation of science and real life examples much like ours! Thank you Cawoods for putting this amazing film together!",False
19,10,Great movie!,mandanicole-73244,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you, so much for making this documentary! For spreading awareness of the harmful impacts of artificial food dyes. To educate families, our school, and our government. I hope they see that there is a need for real change to happen. I suffer from hashimotos thyroid disease and when I have anything with dyes in it I noticed in the past it had caused me severe migraines. When I got glasses I still experienced the migraines until I cut out all artificial food colorings from my diet. I cut out everything that was bad. Can you believe they put food dyes in headache medicine. Which just causes a worse storm of migraines!",False
20,10,"If you have children, you must watch To Dye For",tparky,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wish I had seen this documentary when my children were young. The dedication of the Cawood's to dig deep into the data and to interview experts to validate their findings that artificial dyes have dramatic health effects on children. It cured their son. The documentary will open your eyes, and it lines up perfectly with the current banning by the FDA of Red Dye #3. But winning that battle is only the beginning of a war against dyes and all other chemical ingredients in our food. I hope you will join the fight by watching this documentary and sharing it with others. Well done Whitney and Brandon.",False
21,10,Very Important!!!!,hdrummy,n/a,16/08/2025,I cannot tell you enough how much this documentary means. As a mom with a small family it has opened my eyes wider to what we are putting into our bodies.It is truly amazing what the FDA allows us to ingest into our bodies. It is so important to spread awareness like this documentary does. I think everyone in America should watch it!This documentary connects with you on an emotional and intellectual level. The creators did such a good job with it. I truly hope that it helps us get these synthetic dyes banned in the US. I know To Dye For has made a NOTICEABLE difference in my home and I hope it can in anyone else's home too.,False
22,10,A MUST WATCH DOCUMENTARY,hannahgservis,n/a,16/08/2025,I was captivated by this wonderful documentary from the first scene. It is so informative & heartbreakingly beautiful. Everyone should be informed about what they are putting into their own bodies and their children's bodies. We have to get back to informed consent. Whether or not people choose to consume these things of their own volition or not is not the issue here. It's that we are so unaware of what is being put into our bodies. This documentary shines a bright light on that fact. I am so grateful that these truths are being brought out of the darkness and into the light. I hope we are able to see and learn even more about other harmful ingredients that are allowed in our foods from this amazing group of people in the future!,False
23,10,A powerful documentary for a time such as this!,valzwee,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the wake of all the buzz about synthetic dyes in foods Brandon and Whitney's documentary comes at a perfect time to educate the public about the harmful effects of synthetic dyes. This documentary sheds light on a topic that deserves MUCH discussion, especially for those who live in America. Not only does the film serve to educate viewers on the adverse effects of synthetic dyes in our foods, but it also shares stories of success and ways to help enact change, so that future generations of Americans can enjoy cleaner and healthier food options. With this being Brandon's first documentary film I am blown away with his ability to artfully capture such an important topic and for Whitney's willingness to dive deeper and strive to share with the public her discoveries.",False
24,10,One of the most important documentaries of our time,rosalynzock,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary takes a deep dive into the real-world experiences of several families and the effects artificial food dyes have had on them, and most especially, their children. Because anecdotal evidence was not enough, power couple Whitney and Brandon Cawood traveled the country and even to other countries to speak with experts about the real effects of these artificial dyes. What they found was gut wrenching-there is a huge range of serious physical, emotional, sociological, and physiological consequences, from cancer to suicide and everything in between, from the consumption of these chemicals, many of which the food industry has known about for years, and yet they remain infused into countless products on the shelf. As they continued their investigation, they found that their personal experiences were far from isolated. Awareness is the first step, and change needs to follow. But whose cry will we hear? That of the several billion dollar food industry, or that of our children?",True
25,10,Life Changing,asteeves-05895,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is everything.I have been silently struggling for years with a daughter who is sensitive to artificial dyes. Not knowing how to explain it to other people in way they will understand.This documentary explains everything in a way I could not.I am so thrilled this issue is being brought to attention, the more people that are aware of the dangers of artificial dyes the better.I have been following Whitney and Brandon's journey for the last three years of making this film. They have done a fantastic job. This film is a real testimony of their passion for this issue.It is a must watch!",False

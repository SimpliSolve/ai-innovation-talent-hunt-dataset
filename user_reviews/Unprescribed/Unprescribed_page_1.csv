1,n/a,Hey Gotsuki...,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"That's just like ... your opinion maaaaaan. For the record.... There were no special interest groups involved in the making of Unprescribed and thanks for sharing your story. My story is in the film and so are the stories of other combat veterans who suffered greatly from pharma over-medication and got their lives back with Marijuana. You seem to have a lot of animosity towards Marijuana specifically and are using our film as a platform to speak out against Marijuana, meanwhile ignoring the testimony of the people in the film .. what do you think about their stories? The only thing you spoke about in your review was yourself.",False
2,6,"First, hats off for making this film in the first place",pacocharte,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's definitely way past time for this conversation. The vilification of cannabis must end and people, including soldiers, should be allowed to self-medicate or seek out cannabis therapy from a licensed medical professional (which they can in some states).That said, I dock this movie 3 stars for not getting into the actual reason that these soldiers need such therapy to begin with. Namely, this country's obsession with warfare for profit. If ""we"" weren't engaging in more unnecessary wars than any other country in the world, these soldiers likely wouldn't need ANY form of medication.Please, if you watch this film, also take the time to read Marine Corps. Maj. General Smedley Butler's short book ""War is a Racket.""",False
3,10,Saw at BIFF and changed my thoughts,bawhit,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am one of ""those"" people. Born in '69 and the propaganda about marijuana is so embedded in my thinking even my own 20 year old son is having trouble guiding me to new light.Then I watched Unprescribed. I related it back to many of the comments my son shared. I listened to the documentary. I had the privilege of meeting the writer. And all combined am finally starting to change my mind, my concept.The story, regardless of whether I ever try it or not, needs to be heard. A time to change the nation's perspective is today, not tomorrow, and this is a great launching point. These are not hired or paid actors. They are real people, taking a real risk, with real consequences for sharing. That must say something, right?Thank you to the writer. Thank you to the people willing to share. And thank you to the Beloit International Film Festival for showing this documentary. I hope the philosophy that this will take decades to change is wrong. Change should be today. But with anything new, be it the end of prohibition on alcohol to Facebook, warning labels, guidelines and a reasonable societal response is crucial. That is the keys to successful integration and not a failed attempt. In my humble opinion.",False
4,1,Just another special interest group using vets as a platform to push their agenda,gotsuzuki,n/a,16/08/2025,"I personally have tried to smoke marijuana back in the mid 70s, here and there throughout my life by the growing number of people that were smoking it and now with all the boutique weed, 3/4 of the states across America approving at least medicinal.. the hemp Delta 8 over the counter psychotropic.. I'll tell you what you better not have any kind of paranoia in any part of your psyche because smoking weed, I don't care if it's indica or sativa or Delta a or edible or Vaped no matter what it is you're going to end up in a hospital freaking out and having schizophrenic symptoms., That's what marijuana does to a lot of people. Where is Valium and diazepams relax the central nervous system.. and take away pain for real... I have recorded my blood pressure increasing by 50 points after smoking marijuana, as well as invasive pervasive thoughts that I'm in danger that people are out to kill me that something bad is going to happen I can't breathe properly, my Raynaud syndrome flares up and my hands turn blue. I have documents and photographs and snapshots of blood pressure cuffs all to prove my theory that marijuana is practically lethal to some people. So how dare they put out this misleading video and use the military and damaged veterans to boost their cause.",False

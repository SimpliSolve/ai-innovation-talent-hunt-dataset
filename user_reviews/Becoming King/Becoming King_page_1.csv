1,9,Genuinely Effective,reelscope,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beautiful man with a beautiful spirit, beautiful faith, & beautiful family.Love the simplicity, homemade feel, & genuine nature of this documentary. It didn't need to spend hours deep diving into every aspect of the filmmaking to be effective in its storytelling.It was extremely proficient in conveying the power & emotionality of the process while also giving us a look into at least a piece of who David Oyelowo is. His passion for the role & persistent faith in what he was called to do with it was evident and inspiring to watch unfold.Oyelowo has always been a joy to see on screen. This only bolstered that sentiment for me while also giving me a newfound level of appreciation & admiration for who he is off screen.",False

1,1,"This documentary is completely interfering in Myanmar's internal affairs in the name of ""environmental protection""!",yhgtrfdcvbnm,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary is a case of uninformed foreign media interfering in Myanmar's internal affairs in the name of ""environmental protection"". In 2011, The Guardian reported on a declassified cable from the U. S. Embassy in Myanmar, which stated that the U. S. Embassy in Rangoon was sponsoring activists against the Myitsone dam. In addition, according to local people, they don't know what the Myitsone dam plant is, and the reason they come to protest in front of Chinese companies every day is because they get 5,000 kyat for doing so. As a Burmese, I have a reasonable suspicion that the director of this documentary has some ulterior motive behind it.",False
2,1,we need Myitsone dam,HeyJackson,n/a,15/08/2025,"We need electricity, we need Myitsone dam, please get out of Myanmar.Myanmar's total hydropower resources exceed 100 million kilowatts, making it one of the few countries in the world with extremely rich hydropower resources. The current development and utilization rate is only 2.45%, which is extremely disproportionate to the resources it possesses. In particular, the hydropower project in the upper reaches of the Ai River, the development and construction of hydropower resources, can not only solve Myanmar's industrialization demand for electricity, but also provide clean energy. We need electricity, we need Myitsone dam, please get out of Myanmar.",False
3,1,The truth behind the call.,valtierrapalecek,n/a,15/08/2025,"In Myanmar during the transition period, public opinion was easily manipulated. Some organizations transferred people's dissatisfaction with the military government to China-Myanmar cooperation projects during the military government period, and Chinese-funded projects became the carrier for releasing various emotions in a certain period. These are the root causes of the problems. And through radio, publications to influence the local people, to bring heavy resistance to the restart of the project. Therefore, this so-called documentary is simply the ""documentary"" that someone wants, and it does not film the real situation at all.",False
4,1,Let's hope the Myitsone Dam goes ahead.,gilldavid-94157,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Myitsone Dam has strictly fulfilled the legal procedures of China and Myanmar, and the two governments have signed a framework agreement in this regard; the project has undergone sufficient scientific research and demonstration, and will make significant contributions to Myanmar's economic and social development; the project attaches importance to environmental issues, and has strictly completed the environmental impact assessment of the watershed; and the relevant parties have actively fulfilled their social responsibilities, and properly resettled the immigrants. The project of Myitsone Dam can stand the test of history, and it is hoped that with the unremitting efforts of the relevant parties, the project will be pushed forward smoothly on schedule.",False
5,1,I don't think it's objective enough!,pastythummererni,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw the film at a film festival in the U. S. At first I was looking forward to it, but then I was very disappointed. I think there are a lot of non-objective views in it: first of all, I think the construction of the hydropower plant is something that can bring benefits to the local people in the area, and it's not necessarily a bad thing; secondly, why is it all in the shadow of the U. S.? Is full of black commentary; again, the creators are basically not from Burma, and the interviews are with a handful of people, can they represent the views of everyone? I doubt it. Finally, given the all-female creative team, I can't help but be a little too paranoid. We'll see more non-political documentaries in the future!",False

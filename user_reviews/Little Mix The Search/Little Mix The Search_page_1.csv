1,10,Refreshing TV,rddowns,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great new spin on talent -perfect for sofa Saturday in lockdown #2 The girls are very likeable and the show is good fun. And actually, the bands are pretty good! BBBc renew for season 2!",False
2,10,Fresh,owencollings-76606,n/a,15/08/2025,A much needed revamp of the talent show format. Can definitely see the ratings increasing week by week.,False
3,2,Ouch.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have tried to watch it, but had to give up, it's just awful, the girls are very talented, and very likeable, but judges, come on, that they aren't. They're trying to be overly nice to everyone.The format has been done to death, and it doesn't matter how you dress it up, people are just sick of searches for music talent.It's struggling to get two million viewers, is it any wonder? Compare that to X Factor from a decade ago, where ten million were tuning in.Suggestion, how about a show that searches for actors and actresses? Please please no more singers.I can't bare another minute of it. 2/10.",False
4,10,So different,leahstar-17756,n/a,15/08/2025,I'm not going to lie I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. The format was not like other talent shows and the advice and criticism was actually vocally constructive. My family and I were honestly so gripped hoping our faves would be in the band.,False
5,4,"Enjoyable, but needs some work / adaptations",bluepink,n/a,15/08/2025,"The quality of the talent is good, I also like the visuals, set up, and of course the girls are very nice and give great performances at the start of the shows. I just have a few critques:1. When Little Mix provide feedback to the guests, their feedback is always very generic, bland and nice. They never say anything groundbreaking / worth watching (so I always skip it on catch-up).2. The categories need some work. It's hard to keep track of all the different categories, and some of them feel the same. For example, I would suggest merging 'girl dance group' & 'girl group' into 1 category, keeping the latter. Same for the mixed 'rap R&B group' and 'mixed group'. Then within each of these categories, they can create multiple bands of different styles / genres.3. The winners may not be the most talented, due to the nature of the audience. This is a highly subjective opinion, but I think the most recent winners of this show, only won because the majority of little mix fans (who consequently watch this show) are young girls, who naturally like boy bands. I don't think they won because of talent. And I could potentially see that concept having a negative impact on the show long term.However, I will give the show another go, it was entertaining, just requires more tweaks which is kinda normal for the first time round on a show. I'm not sure about it's longevity though, given the nature of some of the points I've outlined above.",False
6,10,A MUST WATCH SHOW,atanxt,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is such a new and refreshing concept that no one had before like before this there was 'the four' which i enjoyed.. I didn't know what to expect from this show but i clicked in just out of curiosity so till then i am now a huge fan of the show...
I feel like if any of you wants to see a cool kind of reality show but at the same time you are okay with being emotional ..this is definitely a MUST WATCH",False
7,4,Little Mix: The Search,studioAT,n/a,15/08/2025,"Remember when S Club 7 tried to find a band to support them on tour and gave the world S Club Juniors?Well Little Mix clearly do, and are using the same idea with this ""It's really not X Factor"" talent show.And fair play to them, it's not 'X Factor' - people will actually watch it!The only issue I have it's that it's all very nice. I'm not saying one of the girls needs to turn 'Cowell-esque', but there's only so much nicety one can stomach before it turns sappy.It'll do well.",False
8,10,Brilliant,kafkamara,n/a,15/08/2025,"Now that I finished the series I can confidently say that it is quite good.. Since Little Mix are known for going big while on stage, I didn't have any second thoughts about how the production was going to be. The only thing I was kinda afraid of before going in, was "" is it going to be like X-Factor?"". Thank god it's not! Fresh and fun, that's what it is.",False
9,10,A Breath of Fresh Air!,megansourly,n/a,15/08/2025,"I highly recommend! By far the best talent show I've seen! Real, fresh, and incredibly entertaining.",False
10,1,"Same old, same new sound",zanzibarslimm,n/a,15/08/2025,"Move over Dolly the Sheep, time for some real clones!The formula is all there; fame hungry ""influencers"" off tiktok insta etc, out of pitch over-singing, surface level feedback from ""The Experts"" and a stage that could have been ripped out of Tron.The boy/girl groups themsleves are radio 1 wallpaper and often move and shuffle about the stage in a manner they call ""dancing"". Meanwhile the stage lighting team acts like they have a vendetta against epileptics.Costume design is like something from the Ru Pauls Drag Race cutting room floor- which isnt a bad thing! It just looks absolutely bizzare. Its not offensively bad (unless on high volume), its just another carbon-copy talent show that gets the primetime TV spot in the UK.But the BBC are trying so give them a little credit and renew your TV licence this year x",False
11,10,One of the Best singing shows ever.,fitoreziba,n/a,15/08/2025,Everything about this show is FRESH. I highly recommend it. (Better then X Factor the group),False
12,1,Terrible,samueltpowell-72524,n/a,15/08/2025,"Waste of time to watch, painful, people ruining perfect songs",False
13,10,Can't wait for season 2,arnoldkristina,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm a huge little mix fan so I might be a bit biased but this show was great. I feel like the talent was insane, like any of those groups could be releasing music right now. I actually would've liked an extra episode or two of the live performances. Or even a little bit extra time selecting the final members of each band. Sometimes it felt rushed but it could be because they wanted to keep people's attention. I think this show is refreshing because you can tell how much little mix care and their production team does a great job with the artists. You can tell they were getting proper coaching, sick outfits, and amazing stage performances. It always felt like I was watching artists at music award shows. Yea I definitely can't wait for another season, maybe a little longer next time.",False

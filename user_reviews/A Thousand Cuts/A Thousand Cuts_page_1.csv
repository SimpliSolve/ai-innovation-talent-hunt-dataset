This Woman has no INTEGRITY with LIBEL CASES because she's a PRESSTITUTE controlled by OLIGARCHS AND CORRUPT POLITICIAN That reign in the philippines for 30yrs before DUTERTE got ELECTED.,False
2,10,Patient Zero before our eyes,jrneptune,n/a,16/08/2025,"You can ignore the negative reviews. Just like Italy had Mussolini, The Philippines has a President that is using the war on drugs and his Social Media personality to appeal to the people while he takes down the Democratic Constitution of his own government and looks to the silence the press and his opponents while rigging his own legislature with people loyal to him.Loved that it also presented the opinions of those loyal to him and the reasons why. Loved how it explained protecting Democracy is even more important.Everyone needs to see this.",False
3,10,It's more fun in the Philippines!,dennelasicat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not really. This movie doesn't entirely cover the entirety of the circus and horror show that is currently happening in the PH since 2016 when Duterte started his term. HOWEVER, it does give you an idea of the gruesome and bloody behind the scenes of our seemingly ""fun and peaceful"" country. Thousands have lost their lives, billions of pesos have been stolen, politicians from the opposing party have been imprisoned/impeached from trumped up charges and millions still worship our president. It's time to wake up!",False

7,10,An eye-opener,anapacalda,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary is an eye-opener to how the Philippine government suppresses press freedom.,False
8,10,Accurate and eye-opening!,kevavalle,n/a,16/08/2025,"This shows how the current government of the Philippines ran by Rodrigo Duterte is being manipulated to make things happen the way he want them to be - even if it resorts to ending countless lives and calling them ""collateral damage"". Maria Ressa and the rest of Rappler has poked this fascist and dictator where it hurts and will do everything - regardless of constitutionality - to silence these journalists.",False
9,1,Not a documentary. More marketing than anything else.,donvyt,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat a royal waste of time! Were we expected to be enlightened with disparate snapshots of slightly related events with absolutely no clear evidence of any journalistic activity? Their entitled millennial workforce, none of whom are witnesses to history, have now developed a sense of self-importance by their mere affiliation. Trying on clothes, getting a haircut, idle chit-chat on the way to the podium; have they no footage of actual news-gathering or investigative journalism activities to fulfill their runtime obligation? Besides, all parties are portrayed with no one's integrity intact. What's the whole point? If this is the story of the Filipino, I will see you all on the other side, wherever that may be.",True
10,n/a,An all too familiar story by now,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Thousand Cuts follows the story of Maria Ressa, the founder of the Filipino news site Rappler, and her conflict with the government under Rodrigo Duterte. We see the struggle for democracy and freedom of the press as very familiar tactics are used on the populace to turn them towards populism (e.g. Inflammatory rhetoric, bots and trolls, social media). We track Ressa's two arrests for ""cyber libel"" and the campaign for seats in the Philippine senate. Ressa herself is a hopeful figure, but the overall picture looks grim.",False
11,10,A chilling look into the suppression of the free press in the Philippines,ajvirata-78323,n/a,16/08/2025,"Also features: the weaponization of social media, poor karaoke renditions from a senator to-be, bravery in the face of daily terror, and voices of strong women in Maria Ressa, Pia Rañada, and Samira Gutoc as they continue trying to make the truth be heard with their heads held high.",False
12,10,Chilling,edmurphypal,n/a,16/08/2025,Philippine's beginning of democracy's death well documented,False
13,10,Rappler held the line for the Filipino people,kisstopias,n/a,16/08/2025,"This shows how easy majority of the Filipino can be swayed to the different tactics of politicians. Rappler had since held the line so we can get the truth. It is sad to think that many have been trolling around them for years. If you're a filipino, you better watch this so you can vote wisely on the nest elections. This exposed the candidates who are not loyal to their country, but to the current administration",False
14,10,A Must See! Timely and Unfliching Look at Democracy in 2020,lkgleeson,n/a,16/08/2025,"The title of the film, A Thousand Cuts, refers to a small cut that doesn't have much effect on the workings of democracy, yet when repeated over and over each small effect begins to damage the fabric of democracy until it becomes something else. An exceptionally well-made political documentary with a timely urgency and the soul democracy at its core.",False
15,10,This is a murder and horror story,islandhopper_girl,n/a,16/08/2025,This is how Rodrigo Duterte murders democracy. Watch this to be scared.,False
16,10,Definitely a must-watch!,alphadied,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am assuming that most of the negative reviews under this film are pro Duterte administration and it just shows how true the film is. The documentary was not biased at all, it showed both sides of the story and the fact that people who have watched this think that Maria Ressa comes off as a victim says a lot about the administration. The film showed the disturbing reality that has happened in our country for the past years in the Duterte administration. If you refuse to see that then, your opinion doesn't matter.",False
17,1,A Propaganda,j_susvilla,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you come to expect a comprehensive, unbiased look on the Philippine situation under Duterte and why Maria Ressa is passionately abhored by many in the Philippines but adored by the Liberal outsiders, you'll be disappointed. The film essentially depicts Maria Ressa as the victim in the populist (for some reason that word has a negative connotation when Ressa uses it) Duterte's Philippines. It follows Maria Ressa's life whilst in action in the newsroom or away to make a speech upon receiving Liberal-pushed awards and distinctions abroad. It also shows how her sort of relationship with Duterte turned sour from the months leading up to the elections where Rappler supposedly helped Duterte win to years into his presidency where Rappler becomes supposedly the target of verbal attacks of the President.It shows interviews also of Duterte's prominent supporters who helped him win, almost intentionally depicted as if to lack the venerability the film pushes Maria Ressa and her minions to possess. That's when you find it's a propaganda, practically aimed at convincing the Filipinos and clueless outsiders to side with Maria Ressa.I would have wanted to see a more in depth look at the life of Maria Ressa that's also not dismissive of the bad. A few explorations on the opposing narrative to give the film credibility would have been nice. I would have wanted interviews from the likes of ThinkingPinoy to balance it all out. I would have wanted splices of her speeches abroad where she was quoted to be supposedly lying included. I would have wanted the merits of her cases discussed as opposed to just her categorically declaring she is under attack by the Duterte gov't. I would have wanted to see how her supposedly twisted narratives make her one of the most hated personalities in the Philippines. I would have wanted to see interviewed the Manila Times columnist Roberto Tiglao who wrote many exposés about Maria Ressa.But no, it's the Philippines under Duterte in the eyes of Maria Ressa and those who sympathize with her. It is a ""Maala-ala Mo Kaya"" for Maria Ressa. Hardly objective. Hardly comprehensive. Hardly unbiased. Hardly honest. A big Liberal propaganda.",False
18,1,LIES LIES LIES!,alopzel,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie is full of lies. they are spreading misinformation to the public.,False
19,1,"IF THIS CAN BE RATED A 0, I WOULD",eriksala-128-419832,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFor the reader and other raters who do not really live in the Philippines, this person here, Maria Ressa, is actually a spreader of fake news in our country. Try looking at the other side of the story and know the real truth.",True
20,1,Nothing more than than a terrorist/syndicate propaganda,clariceann,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film was made entirely to discredit and humiliate the people and governments which are not in favor of the this terrorist group and their cohorts. maria ressa is a convicted criminal, everything they promote and say is entirely for the purpose of their own benefit regardless even if it is a lie. And that is what this film is, a total LIE.",False
21,1,This is a Propaganda of the Convicted Maria Ressa,wesihay,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerBelieving lies from this witch. Fake information spreader.,True
22,1,A Political Step from The Opposition.,IshiGrit,n/a,16/08/2025,"Journalism is founded on unbiased and unprejudiced principles. Yet, as a Filipino, it is quite alarming that the media has become the last resort for a dying political party (Liberal Party) that ousted the dictator decades ago. The documentary plainly shows the shallow perspective of Maria Ressa towards the status of Duterte's Philippines. Currently, the administration has several flaws, but every flaw they can get a hand on becomes a weapon of the opposition to use against the admin with the mass media being the medium. You see, ignorance is truly rampant in a country that even takes pride in being in a third-world state and highest incomprehension. This is the PH, the epitome of a developing ship that is about to sink due to the customs and culture of its people.The desperate measures are taken by the opposition, even creating a film with a POV of a CEO of a biased and issue maker media just to create a stir and a belief towards a non-existent ""fascist"" government in PH. It is undeniable that the Philippines will no longer alleviate the poor conditions of the country but worsen the cause to a point where the integrity of the government officials and the media can no longer be trusted, while the masses would like to create factions, dividing the country with their stupid fanatic ideologies (DDS & YELLOWS).If you want to know more about PH history and its failures? Do not waste your time, as this documentary film is an example of how biased the history of the PH is and how one-sided a Filipino ignorant can become so furious armed and backed with hate from the oppositions.Lastly, vote the person not the party, vote the person you choose according to your understanding and principles. Do not be swayed by the fads and trends, besides everyone is a bandwagon nowadays.",False
23,1,Please dont believe her she will confuse you,gtsforge,n/a,16/08/2025,OLIGARCH APPROVED AND SUPPORTED Rappler is so good at spreading lies and inventing stories . Duterte saved the philippines and is growing faster and people are living better lives than ever before .,False
24,1,"Politically driven, out of touch with reality and filipino sentiments",sonic_euge,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is obviously a politically driven movie which fits its title, thousand cuts (information restrained, spliced to suit her narrative and deception).
Maria ressa herself doesnt have moral descendency nor reputation of tellin the truth.
Just for the record of international viewers,all the cases she has now is against her rappler (funded by omar network-known cia, against philippines consititution of no foreign funding), tax evasion cases, libel cases by a private citizen and many more.Many times on her interviews with BBC hardtalk, her lies were exposed.
Ezra levant even confronted her on one forum and she admitedly said they were funded by omidyar
All of these are on youtube, go search it out.This is what happens when journalist acts god and untouchable.
She has a really bad reputation in the philippines, everythin that she says always put a grain of salt to it",False

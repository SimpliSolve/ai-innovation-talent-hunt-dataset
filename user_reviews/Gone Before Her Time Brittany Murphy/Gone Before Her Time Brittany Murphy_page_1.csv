1,6,weirdness in hollywood.,ksf-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's okay. I did learn some new things about the case that I hadn't known before. I think the fact that so much time has passed, allowed more info to come to light than was known right when it happened; i hadn't known that they were already sick from a visit to puerto rico. This, in addition to alleged drug/meds use, isn't a good combination. Then, add in possible mold in the house, it could totally be a deadly combination. Unfortunately, I don't think they interviewed any first responders, physicians, or psychologists. They were probably scared of being sued by the families. I realize they can't discuss this specific case for hipaa reason, but it would have been helpful to speak to certified experts in general terms. So many interviews by observers and journalists. It runs eighty six minutes on free tubi streaming channel. Interesting stuff, if you were a ""king of the hill"" fan.",False
2,8,Sad,hazangel-89910,n/a,16/08/2025,I usually watch any and everything pertaining to Brittany Murphy. I have always loved her. She was one of my favourite actresses. Even her not-so popular movies were great. The one I remember is Ramen Girl. It was just so quirky and fun. Brittany lit up the screen when she was on it.She was not the most beautiful actress (although I thought she was gorgeous inside and out) but I do believe she was one of the most underrated and talented actresses. I have to admit I didn't know she had such a beautiful singing voice. Her death has always perplexed me!I really dont see what she saw in Simon. He really seemed very unlikeable. Seems like he was the perfect con man. RIP Brittany. You did not deserve any of this!,False

1,5,Ok but not accurate,traciireese,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHe did not switch to a healthy vegan whole food plantbased diet. He just cut animal products out. If he wanted his numbers to drastically improve he needed to eat Whole Foods like potatoes, rice, beans, lentils, vegetables, fruit, tofu, tempeh, corn, sweet potatoes, and leave out the oils and processed foods. I too fell into the vegan junk foods but learned later that cutting out processed foods and oils brings your numbers into a healthy range and have seen others get off diabetics medication and cholesterol medication. I hope people will try the correct way before saying it hasn't improve their numbers much. It's worth a try but the right way.",True
2,1,What is this rubbish?,davebutterworth85,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis guy hasn't got a clue about nutrition. Pointless, uninformative documentary. Misleading and shallow in content. The unfortunate reality of the society we live in is we're generally undereducated about nutrition and food. He states at the start of his journey on to a vegan diet that his current diet his healthy - all whilst preparing a bowl of wheatabix and cows milk? Stating he drinks several pints of cows milk a week. Clearly, this guy knows his stuff, and that shows when he switches to veganism and fails to understand how to combined whole foods to meet his dietary requirements. Guzzling down excessive sugar and highly processed ""free from"" products. No wonder we have a health epidemic in the UK.",True
3,2,Didn't follow the diet properly so pointless,danijackson-32236,n/a,15/08/2025,"He claimed he wanted to see what was the benefit of a whole food plant based diet but didn't actual follow a whole food diet. He eats cereal, McDonald's, tesco meal deals and other junk. He showed what it's like to transition to a vegan diet and the difficulties involved but there was such a lack of preparation that he wasn't able to carry out the intended purpose.This documentary isn't testing the health benefits of whole food plant based diet, it's really just showing what it's like for a normal person to go straight to eating vegan and how easy it is start eating the junk, that's not what helps with health.",False
4,8,For what it's worth it's not a bad watch,BryanH-68,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really enjoyed it for what it's worth. Andy Blithe delivers a good shortish documentary about veganism and tries out the diet for a while. It's a good view and I would recommend you'd give it a watch. Andy does his work and documents the lifestyle, over a course of weeks he develops a change and appreciates the inner strength of veganism and the pros that come with it. It's a massive success to see documentaries like this and with Aturn Films, he does a bloody good job at providing them. No doubt about it.The film tackles points on what vegans do to stay in shape and the impact it makes on mental health, metabolism and staying in shape.",False
5,4,Pretty pointless,joshhartj,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSo I think what the film really highlights is the very common misconception that vegan = whole food plant based, but they are not the same thing. You can be vegan and still eat some pretty bad foods. To be fair, he does seems to eat healthier than the average diet. However, he probably should have consulted with some people knowledgeable on the subject of plant based whole foods eating to help him achieve what I think he meant to accomplish. As soon as he completed his first shop with a cart full of packaged foods I knew he was conflating the terms vegan and whole foods plant based. It would be fine I guess if he stuck to saying he was vegan but he repeatedly would say he was whole foods plant based, and then he goes out and orders something with a side of crisps. It doesn't take an expert to see why his numbers didn't change substantially when still eating processed foods cooked in oils.He is also only looking at a single metric to determine if he's ""healthy"" and that is cholesterol. If he had additional tests done like a Dexa scan and performance benchmarking he may have been able to see changes in other meaningful ways. But again, that would also require making a meaningful change to his diet not just removing meat.",True
6,2,While good plant ????,ytzvrqp,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerWhole food plant diet but starts out buying all kinds of canned stuff and pasta wanting to see cholesterol change but eating deep fried things in vegetable oil that's bad always only sure in food olive oil rock in Polyphenols in my experience my cholesterol went from very bad at 375 to normal at 135 the diet was poor needed to his research for heart healthy began the result would have been astounding and you still have to watch your calories no matter what you eat it was almost a disrespect to all vegans and people who do this for the real benefits it scares people away thinking there's no difference it will make.,True

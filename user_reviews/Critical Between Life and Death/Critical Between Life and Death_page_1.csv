1,9,Not for the squeamish but a brilliant watch.,hbrackley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Raw, honest and a reminder how lucky we are in the UK having some of the best trauma units in the world. If you don't like seeing scenes of trauma and surgeries, watch this with caution. This is a great insight on our great NHS and just shows how professional, dedicated and human every member of staff are.",False
2,9,thE HARSH REALITY OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,MateuszP-67,n/a,16/08/2025,"Critical: Between Life and Death is a powerful and honest look at what happens when lives hang in the balance in the hospital. It captures the complexity of the current medical system and the difficulty of decisons that doctors have to make everyday.It's very personal, real, and sometimes heartbreaking. The series shows just how fragile we are as humans.",False
3,8,Good,schmitzsimonjaund,n/a,16/08/2025,"By Netflix standards, it's really very good, with detailed depictions. It's a real documentary, even if you sometimes think it's a fictional series. The doctors change constantly, so you can't develop a connection with them, which is a bit of a shame. Some scenes, like the open scalp (his face is peeled off), are tough stuff.",False
4,10,Not for the faint-hearted,OJT,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some have criticized this, perhaps because they struggle to see blood or operations, but this series is truly profound in its depiction of surgical details. No blurrying, no sensorship, just truth.I found it compelling how the surgeons in the 2nd and 3rd episode are putting small bone fractures in his smashed head together like a puzzle. This is extreme engineering from the doctors, and it's a compelling watch.If this is recommended? Well, of course, if you are not of the faint-hearted. It might get someone to faint.",False
5,10,Brilliant homage to trauma treatments,imdbfan-853813,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you aren't prepared to see the behind the scenes of trauma care - I would suggest watching something else. However this show immerses you so well into a glimpse of what these professionals experience every single day. It is heartwarming, thrilling and such a great watch. Would definitely recommend watching it.",False
6,10,Real life modern day super heroes!,WesleyT-9,n/a,16/08/2025,ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! Definitely binge worthy in my opinion! It's a very up close and personal experience with the real life super heroes of the London Trauma centers. Everything from the paramedics picking serious trauma victims up to the real time life & limb saving surgeries. There are definitely some very gruesome scenes so just close your eyes during those parts if you get squeamish.,False
7,10,You have to be able to handle it,renee_engelberts,n/a,16/08/2025,"The series is very similar to the fantastic British television program A&E, but with a look behind the scenes. Everything is shown, from shattered lower legs to surgery on a shattered eye socket. You have to be able to handle it, but it has increased my existing respect for all the medical staff even more. Moreover, the personal stories of the patients' families are indispensable, and it gives the patient a face.",False
8,10,Excellent documentary,imdbfan-559755,n/a,16/08/2025,Shows real life how teams of medics come together to treat severely injured patients. It's really touching to listen to both the medics and patient stories. Highly recommend. Provides excellent insight into a very stressful environment and is tuly cinematic with a good mixture of suspense and drama.,False
9,10,Showcasing the amazing NHS,kaneybaby,n/a,16/08/2025,This programme showcases the amazing NHS staff who deal with a variety of complex cases multiple times of day. The skill and ability of all the medical staff shown is exceptional. As a Brit I am exceptionally proud of our NHS and the amazing people that work so hard to help everyone. We area leading example to the rest of the world. I hope that if I ever have the need I that I get to encounter any of the doctors and nurses in this programme. What an amazing example of excellence.,False
10,7,"Graphic - But, Not much else",jenniferwarnock,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis doco is extremely graphic. If you're not ready for brain surgery close ups, this is not for for you.Overall, I don't understand how the 999 system works in the UK. And I lived there. Would have liked some more explanation on how each emergency division works. Not sure if the call center is just a call center or something more? Medics shows up and then a different medic shows up?Would have liked more explanation. How does the NHS work, how do the hospitals work. How does dispatch work? How does it all work together?This documentary is good, but, it can't decide if it's a medical tell all, or an emotional family piece, it never seems to really strike which it wants to be.When I expect to watch a ""Birds Eye ER"" drama, I don't usually expect more family interviews. Because of that, I never felt totally immersed. There were too many POVs, so, I never was really able to dig in.",True
11,8,I actually give this an 8,alexandraahlen,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series is very ""in your face"" with how brutal injuries can be from both accidents and straight-on assault. I genuinely love how we get to both see it all of how it's done (it's amazing what people in medicine can do and does do!) AND get to know the people behind it, victims, doctors, nurses, students, families and more.My heart broke for one young man who showed instant signs of severe PTSD after a brutal assault, and I hope he gets the therapeutic help that he needs. What he experienced could break anyone and everyone, and I really do wish him all the best. Stay strong, Jack!",False
12,1,I don't know how anyone can watch this.,LukeCustomer2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Of course the stories are compelling but the style of this documentary will give you a headache. Typical Netflix it is just a bunch of the same footage spliced together fast with people saying obvious things like his could be serious. The first episode concerns an accident at a fair but for the life of me I have no idea what happened. No clips from news coverage... nada. Just showing the same clip they filmed which may, or may not, be of the exact ride. Several times they will put up the same map showing the difference between the distance of the hospitals. Over and over again to pad the run time. I left really not having much of a grasp on anything other than people were hurt.Pure ""Medicalganda"" that gave me a headache.",False
13,9,Gripping,vranckentimothy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very good Netflix show. Worth a watch. Makes you think about life. It's also taking about different people and different doctors. Would certainly recommend watching it. I finished
It in one day. I hope they will make more seasons of it because it really has me addicted to watching it. That said ! Just watch it.",False
14,9,Amazing,re_incarnate,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not gonna lie, I had to look away a lot, being squeamish about blood and surgery. But I powered through, simply because the doctors and the medical staff who do these jobs are just amazing.It's a no frills series, presented in a straightforward way, but to hear these medical professionals talk about their cases and how they feel about them, the amount of care and effort that they put into the work was very inspirational. This was a very eye-opening watch and I certainly have increased appreciation for what happens at critical care units.",False
15,10,High octane real theatre,nicbradley-42975,n/a,16/08/2025,"Compulsive viewing from the off .This show really hi lights what incredibly skilled professionals we are all so fortunate to have in our NHS .Great human stories on all sides.A tight product that must have been a real slog for some poor soul to edit .Well done Netflix on a great product.Finally , if you know anyone who is considering voting reform or if you are , watch this and try & think a bit deeper on immigration.",False
16,9,Fascinating!,lornak-18008,n/a,16/08/2025,I couldn't stop watching and I'm really hoping for another season. This involved the major trauma centers in London and chose several patients to spotlight from initial treatment in the ER to surgery(in some cases)to the day they go home. Some are hurt worse than others. A lot of brain injuries are shown. We do get to see some of the doctor's own traumas that encouraged them to go into their field of study. Please note-It's very graphic at times so if you are squeamish maybe don't watch.,False
17,5,Interesting,gtxqjz,n/a,16/08/2025,I enjoy medical media and shows and i often have questions while viewing. I heard multiple times that they're the best in the world yet i could'nt find any of the hospitals depicted in the show among the best hospitals in the world. At least the top 50 that i saw anyway. Please correct me if I'm wrong.,False

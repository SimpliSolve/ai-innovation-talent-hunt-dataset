1,7,Good at telling part of the story...,AJBraxton,n/a,16/08/2025,"Consider the source. If you are looking for a documentary that looks with thoughtful introspection at the ""Jesus"" music movement - this is not the one. An early indicator would be the mention of Lonnie Frisbee as the original thought leader and flash point for the inclusion of contemporary music into christian services. The film never speaks about how he was ostracized for being gay .. and yet, it does examine (all be it briefly) the challenges the industry had with racism. But.. if you, like myself, ""grew up"" with this music it is a nice trip down memory lane and will spark many ""whatever happened to"" thoughts. Minor license is taken with chronology. Keith Green's impact and death are given cursory note and out of the correct chronological sequence. This is a show that ""preaches to the choir"" and having been someone who was at one time very much in the choir.. I enjoyed it.",False
2,7,50 years in 100 minutes.,dblanken47,n/a,16/08/2025,"The executive producers of this documentary are Amy Grant and Michael W Smith. Much of this documentary is about...Amy Grant and Michael W Smith. There's a lot of good here, but as other reviewers have noted there are a lot of important artists that were left out. In this day and age material like this would have better been served to be a six-part documentary. One episode for each decade? Or each episode centering on thematic issues like the content of the lyrics, the quality of music, how CCM has changed music styles in the local church, etc? Still, it was worth a trip down memory lane.",False
3,8,Great CCM documentary but left some performers out,spitfirereviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI absolutely love The Jesus Music documentary. I grew up during the 80s with Michael W. Smith, Amy Grant, Sandi Patti, DC Talk, etc. So it was interesting to learn about the 70s Jesus Movement and it was fun to see so many of my favorite CCM artists. Listening to Michael, Amy, Russ Taff, Bill Gaither talk about the good 'ol days was like having a long overdue conversation with old friends.I didn't know about Stryper being so influenced by Jimmy Swaggart. Very interesting.Having said that, I have to ask, what's the deal with not even mentioning Twila Paris? She was the first CCM artist I knew! Twila toured with Michael, Amy, Larnelle Harris, 4HIM, etc. During the Young Messiah Tour of the 90s. Twila Paris' hit song 'God is in Control' was hugely popular, and she doesn't even get mentioned??Also, what about Carman? He broke records, and he's barely mentioned!?! I understand Michael and Amy are the King and Queen of CCM, but it was like Andrew Erwin and Jon Erwin have some problem with giving Carman his due, a sad decision given that Carman had just passed away a year or so ago.What about 4HIM? Point of Grace? These groups were hugely popular and they didn't even get one second of screen time, yet we get lots and lots of DC Talk and Kirk Franklin. Not cool.What about Petra? Petra got a passing glance while Stryper got LOTS of screen time?! Also not cool.Other than that, The Jesus Music is a fun, nostalgic journey through contemporary Christian music which made me fall in love with the music AND Jesus all over again.",True
4,10,Great trip down memory lane,loiacki,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie captured the soundtrack of my childhood into my 20's and beyond. It was very well done and really brought back a lot of memories. I am happy they tackled some of the more difficult topics and I hope people learn and stop repeating the past.,False
5,10,Loved it,jhn_knr,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had to drive 70 miles round-trip to see this and it was very much worth it. I laughed a lot, teared up several times, and got to relive my youth and the music that came to define it. It was essentially the soundtrack of my life. I definitely appreciated this documentary and all who gave their time to be involved in it.",False
6,10,Moving,colewaters,n/a,16/08/2025,The Jesus Music is what I call a moving movie about Christian music. I love Christian music and seeing a movie about how it became was really really good. I loved every second of this film.,False
7,7,Missed opportunity,gheppler-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like how the documentary talks about the very beginnings of Christian music. There are so many missed artists that they could have highlighted. They spent too much time on Stryper, DC talk, and others. I would have cut those parts down and added people such as Randy Stonehill, the Imperials, and many, many others that blazed the trail the foundation of Christian music.",False
8,10,God will Do IT Again,jasonc-34418,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jesus Music is an insightful nostalgic trip through the Christian time space continuum. If you were born in the 60's or 70's and grew up listening to Christian music, this is a must watch. If you didn't follow Christian music and the ""Church"" through the decades you won't understand the valleys these artist traveled through to reach the mountain top.If you can't identify with the adversity these artist and their followers faced, maybe you can see how the church learned forgiveness, love and repentance, and that God sent His Son Jesus for such a time as this.Billy Graham got it right. If you can't watch this film and see that God is about to do this all over again in this nation and in a new way, ask God to open your eyes and prepare your heart to love.I am deeply blessed by this film and these artist. #real.",False
9,6,No Mention of Third Day,jeremypdugas,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNot a bad documentary, however, it's also missing several items, including any mention of Third Day, among others. Hops around a bit as well. Worth watching.",True
10,4,Over-hyped and commercial,beornmatt,n/a,16/08/2025,"So many bands, so many artists advertised, and almost zero payoff. This was just one huge commercial for modern worship stuff. It was cool nostalgia but that's about it.",False
11,9,Almost Got It,keith-40918,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI started listing to CCM in the late 70's, so I experienced much of this in real time. In the 90's to early 2000's got to be an insider for a while in a band myself. I was a long subscriber of CCM magazine, so I have a wealth of useless CCM knowledge in my head. When I started seeing the trailer for this movie I was both excited and skeptical. ""No way they are going to get it right,"" I thought after seeing the artists who would be the presenters.After watching it, I was pleasantly surprised. They started exactly right and I loved the time they spent with those pioneering artists like Love Song and Larry Norman. Rez Band was one of my favorites, so comments from Glenn Kaiser scored points. Petra probably got too little screen time as a brief mention as an 80's band. Petra actually started in 1970 near the beginning, so not enough love there I thought. Giving some time to Steve Taylor was absolutely a win for alternative, though they could have thrown a bone to groups like Daniel Amos, 77's, Adam Again, The Choir, whose influence in their genre was monumental. No mention of White Heart is criminal. They owned the 80's Christian rock scene.It is true, they could never mention every artist that meant something to someone in two hours. There are just too many to cover. Maybe they could have squeezed a few more in if they hadn't spent so much time with Kirk Franklin and Lecrae talking about there were no black artists for them to follow since Andrae Crouch. Off the top of my head names like Leon Patillo, Larnelle Harris, Bebe and Cece, The Winans, Anointed, Take 6, Mary Mary, John P. Kee to name a few. And Lecrae is miles away from being the first black Christian rapper embraced by the CCM community (Michel Peace, PID, ETW, SFC, Gospel Gangstaz, T-Bone, Dynamic Twins, JC & the Boyz, DOC, JC Crew, Mike E, The Rapsures, GRITS, Verb, all came before Lecrae). It was a bit of a slap to these artists to be dismissed as having not existed.I was a Stryper fan through the 80's and never knew about their tie to Jimmy Swaggart. Found that interesting. There were many other Christian metal bands that would have been nice to see a nod to, like White Cross. Geoff Moore and the Distance? David and the Giants? John and Dino Elefante were big influencers in the industry.All that said, I still give 9 stars. Only docked 1 star for the racism section. I would have like to seen more, but it would have been a trilogy to rival Lord of the Rings to include everyone I felt worthy. Good job and maybe we can have a part 2, the ones we forgot :)",True
12,4,A 1/4th documentary,theblueocarina,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe title says the words ""the Jesus music"", and has the names of bands/groups on the front of the cover. In advertising for a movie which poster, the names listed as credits on the front, are covered or are represented properly. This was not that kind of movie.I came into watching this movie with high hopes. Finally, they made a documentary for the Christian music that was so precious across the decades of my life. Finally, I would be able to revisit some of the good stuff from my past. Stuff that I listen to still to this day. There is no mainstream music that is better.What really stuck out that caused me to start seeing that my hopes were going to be let down, was that they had Lauren Daigle giving commentary, because this movie was supposed to be about the Jesus music. That means that you have those who were a part of those decades, and not a kid who didn't live it.It's kinda of like asking somebody's wife who hasn't seen Star Wars with their husband, what it was like in the 70's, in that theater where or first was shown. Or kids now a days who go see Beatles cover bands, and they think that, after they have seen the Beatles impersonators, that now they are authorities on the Beatles. But they never lived in the time of the Beatles, and the wife still hasn't seen Star Wars. It's like that with Lauren Daigle speaking in a documentary about the Jesus music .Anyways, there is too much missing. If they just wanted to make a motivational film that glimpsed a couple bands from the past, then don't make a title and an advertisement about an entire documentary but then you only make 1/4 percent of a documentary. Also, don't put any names of the bands and people on the front, of you aren't going to cover them.The Christian music was bursting at the seems with so much awesome music, and yet, ""let's leave all of that stuff out"". That's inexcusable, producers Mrs. Grant and Mr. SmithAND, it was cringe worthy to see that there was a part of the movie that played the ""mainly a white audience"" card. It seems like you just can't escape the block heads who see racism everywhere. I thought that in Jesus Christ there is none of that. But I guess Kirk Franklin wants to resurrect it.Hopefully, Mr. Franklin will let the resurrected Jesus Christ(whom he professes faith in) be the only one that Mr. Franklin resurrects as his Lord and Savior, instead of crt.",True
13,8,Lots of good insight missing a some key players,felipejflores3,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile it was very much a reminiscent documentary many of the bass I enjoyed 80s-90s were featured. Im thrilled they got Michael Sweet of Stryper on this. I think they hit the race issue but neglected a huge contribution of the Winans family, they were a big part of music also Pop Staples.I know they had limited time to get it all in. It would be great to see a Rock Documentary on Christian music that would hit up Petra, Whitecross, Guardian, Stryper and all the other hard hitters to now bands like Skillet.I liked the honesty about how the ""church"" people were their opposition. I also like how Bill Gaither pointed out you won't find any perfect artist. Humanity is fallen and just because they are Christian in the public eye doesn't make them perfect. It probably makes it even harder to be good with so much temptation in front of them from all angles. This then returns us to the story of Grace, GOD's GRACE.",True
14,8,worth,nim-rod77,n/a,16/08/2025,Great production value.This was so aesthetically pleasing that little else would matter.. but being a christian project it makes it tenfold more pleasing.,False
15,8,The executive producer is the focal point.,norris-10162,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerGreat film on the history of a Christian music that made significant changes from the last 40 years.In the film one notices that there is a subversive message of how Amy Grant was treated poorly after her divorce and pop music hits.Strangely she is portrayed as the catalyst that helped Christian music become popular.It's sad to make it seem that without her career that music made by Lauren Daigle or for King and County who have successfully produced music for a secular and Christian audience could not do this absent of the sacrifices by Grant.I for one do not want to hold her past against her and hope for her to continue making music whatever arena she feels comfortable.,True
16,9,Great Documentary,alexkzapf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very eye opening. While it, obviously, shows the highs. It shows the artists frailty. If you have any interest in music do yourself a favor and watch. There is a moment where they talk about Tobymacs oldest son passing of an overdose, it is touching. I remember Toby handling that loss as good as anyone I have ever seen. He truly shows his emotions. I live how it credits Amy Grant with starting this push to the music becoming mainstream stream. Not with that intent in mind. Again. This is eye opening. It says a lot about these artists to just be honest. As honest as anyone would be. I have always liked Christian pop and gospel. This sheds a new light for me. Also. A great part about Kirk Franklin. What a pioneer.",False
17,1,MOR Fluff,flybass5,n/a,16/08/2025,No Rez Band? No Barnabas? No Daniel Amos? This isn't really much of a documentary. It's just another commercial for the socially acceptable music played in mega churches.,False
18,9,Nostalgic and real,mattcyphert12,n/a,16/08/2025,"Goes behind the scenes of the people's lives what they had to face from the world and how the church struggled with this music. The only reason I give it a 9 is so many stories weren't told like Phil keaggy, Larry Normans story was short, but overall a wonderful documentary.",False
19,10,Loved it!,NoellaSue,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was gritty, honest, and uplifting. I went from laughter to being challenged to tears as I remembered the great music from these early years. I was disappointed though, that Jonathan David Brown wasn't mentioned as he was the producer, audio engineer on so many of those albums.",False
20,9,Moving and powerful,johnmorrisfamily,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amy Grant said it best about Christian artists, ""God is good, and you're just one of his messy followers telling everyone how good he is."" Her words are profound and sums up the message of The Jesus Music. This documentary is excellent and a must see! It takes us back to the beginning of Christian Rock with bands like Stryper, Petra, and how their music was shunned by the church and called Devil music; The Jesus Movement introducing drums and electric guitar into worship..., and the growth of artists like Amy Grant and Sandi Patty, Toby Mac with their real-life struggles, and how the music industry turned their backs on them. I was deeply moved when Michael W Smith was inspired to bring worship back to Christian contemporary music and brought us the incredible Worship album. This documentary was great on many levels and brought me to tears several times. The interviews were inspiring and honest, and I was reminded how powerful music is to God and the kingdom of heaven. Watch this and your heart will be stirred.",False

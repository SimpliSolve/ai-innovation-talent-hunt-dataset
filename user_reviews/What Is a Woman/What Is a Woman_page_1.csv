1,8,Those who call it transphobic haven't watched it,omega_work,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was quite surprised to see the level of respect this film had for the subjects, at many points reflecting on the sympathy for children suffering with gender identity.I think what I appreciated most was that these weren't trick questions, the presenter asked very basic and honest questions - the fact that a univeristy professor was unable to answer simple questions in his own field was very telling. It was a running theme that those who wanted honest discussions were being shut down, lose their careers and even faced imprisonment.Speaking with an African tribe was also an interesting juxtaposition of societal ideals.My one criticism is that I wish he had not been able to open the jar of pickles.",False
2,9,Worth Watching,drael64,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is affecting. It starts with emotions of confusion, humor and fascination, and journey's deep into a place of disturbance and despair. It has some mild trolling at the start, but it genuinely gives everyone a chance to speak and doesn't have any dishonest cuts. It handles a topic that's managed to become controversial in maybe the last five years. But it also asks questions, that no matter where you stand we should be asking if we really care about people - are the procedures successful outcomes? Are there lasting after effects or issues? Are we influencing people and in what ways? Do children have a clear sense of self and consent?",False
3,9,An Actual Documentary,jerrycoliver,n/a,16/08/2025,"So, its fairly well produced, it looks good (certainly comparable to other documentaries out there.) All of the technical aspects of the film are in order. Nothing truly stands out as exceptional, but everything is very much professional.From an approach perspective, it really is more of a documentary than most ""documentaries"" in that, the main character (Matt Walsh) is asking questions to try and understand the opposing opinion. Most ""Documentaries"" have a side and then only interview supporting perspectives of the thesis. In this case, Walsh actually interviews the opposing side a lot. For that reason alone, this a more honest documentary. Now, fair-is-fair, I don't like the subject of documentaries to be the documentarian. I believe that would classify it as more journalistic or activist (a-la, Moore or Spurlock.) But it is a common documentary style.That said, I guess we get into the meat of it and why people love it or hate it. As before mentioned, there is a lot of exchanges with opposing view points, and those view points did not make strong arguments. Did Walsh interview the actual leading experts on the subjects? Maybe, maybe not. They do have considerable credibility, but Walsh himself is by no means an expert in the field, so even if the people he's interviewing are not the leaders, it's not like it's an unfair fight.I think if you're for or against this subject matter, it's probably a good film to watch. It's always good to know what the opposing arguments are, but for some reason this topic people get very passionate about. From a purely creative standpoint, I think it's great, not exceptional, but if you like documentaries, it's going to be one of the best ones this year.",False
4,10,Just watch it.,ranentrudgett,n/a,16/08/2025,An incredibly important and insightful documentary for our time and surprisingly funny at times.Highly recommended to anyone who is interested in the topic and wants to learn more about how gender has become politicized including what different people from various fields and communities have to say from both sides of the discussion. 10/10.,False
5,10,Upsetting,hampersnow-41369,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie, which is basically Matt Walsh trying to get a simple answer to the title question is very well done, while also being frightening, upsetting and sickening in proving how far our society has fallen. It's a must watch for parents, but also anyone horrified by what they see and read in the world today. He talks to both sides, right and left, people on the street and even people in Africa, in a segment that really puts this controversial subject in a different light.",False
6,5,A missed opportunity,keithbolton,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was so looking forward to seeing this doc, as I had imagined an even handed, serious investigation into a very complex issue.What we got was a film maker who obviously knew what he believed before he made the film, and went out of his way to slew the interviews and commentary to his own view.The interviewees he agreed with were obviously given the time and backing to represent their own views. Those who he knew would disagree with were obviously there under false impressions, as can be seen in the confusion on their faces.What is worse, it embraces falsehood such as the 'fake news' of the pupils identifying as cats. (they didnt. Its old news. Please move on)The ast 15 minutes shows how seriously he was on the documentary as it was basically a rant which he could probably have filmed before he even started filming this.This topic needs a serious, baolanced review of this vfery serious topic - this film is not it.I give it 5 stars for at least starting a process of discussion, but the second hanlf of the film displays what should have been stated at the start. This is a rant by a person who already knows what he believes. This topic needs a balanced, less aggressive approach from someone who hasnt made their mind up in advance.",True
7,7,Enjoyable but one-sided,alexischristod,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very enjoyable to watch, but too biased to be called a documentary, and is well designed to support e certain narrative. It cherry picks interviews with stupid or dangerous people in the LGBTQ+ community and well grounded/sophisticated people on the conservative side to present a reality with lunatics vs pragmatists. There are bright minds, like the ones that have helped society move forward the last 100 years, that could provide the real arguments on why gender as a term is a valuable tool in order to study social behaviours and understand ourselves. These bright minds were not presented.",False
8,5,"since there are no mid reviews, thought I'd provide one",lmk-57374,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary addresses a lot of very important issues facing society today; unfortunately it does not do so in an open and honest manner. Walsh's biases very clearly seep through his questions in every interview of the opposing side. Despite talking calmly and evenly, he comes off as antagonistic, which is detrimental to any productive conversation.That having been said, his targeted questions, have meaning and import. The fact that virtually no member who radically espouses transgender ideology, even professors and doctors, can define a simple term like ""woman"" without relying on using the term to define the term (something we teach even elementary students not to do) is very telling and concerning. The fact that there are professionals that are so blinded by their bias they genuinely think their opinions comprise the majority of people and there is no social component, that think almost no person who transitions wants to transition back, that there are no longevity studies on the drugs they are administering showing negative consequences (when there factually are), is absolutely frightening. These ""experts"" who have clearly abandoned true science are being put in charge of making these decisions in the name of science.Ultimately, the documentary has some very important material, and I reluctantly say is worth the watch, but I wish it were done in a less judgmental manner. If Walsh had approached these people more sympathetically and openly, letting them hang themselves with their own rope would have been much more impactful.I can't help but wonder as we see several interviews cut short by the interviewee, and we see Walsh stoically combative, what harsher questions were edited out, which I feel undercuts his intent.",False
9,9,What is the Truth?,lanierys,n/a,16/08/2025,"Despite the ruckus and waves this movie has seemingly caused, I think that before one judges it, one should give it a view. Perhaps there's a reason it's caused a fuss..
As with nearly any documentary, the writer does have a side he leans toward; however, that does not mean the information within is invalid. Both sides are interviewed and given a platform to speak ""their truth."" Both sides were also given a list of questions that would be asked. The difference was the answers given..or not given.I must encourage a watch. It is a great wealth of information no matter where you fall.",False
10,10,What a hard question!!,ceqkvejc,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI never would have thought asking ""people of science"" a question would lead to such anger and disdain. I've seen videos of scientists reacting to ""flat earthers"" and this is the exact opposite. No attempt to educate or show the science behind what they say! I can't believe this is actually a something that is up for debate.",True
11,10,"Equal parts hilarious, eye-opening, disturbing and powerful",Christopher_Reid,n/a,16/08/2025,"Matt Walsh is great. In a time of ridiculous ideas and terrible logic, especially in politics, he's consistently a voice of reason. I disagree with him on only a few relatively minor things, but most of the time, he explains himself very clearly, step by step, and with a very dry sense of humour.Here, he does the right thing in patiently letting us here all the sides to this issue without instantly blurting out his opinions and reasoning. He just listens. He plays dumb, but not rudely. He asks sincere, relevant questions. He plays devil's advocate on both sides.The interviewees include regular people, experts, academics, authors, professionals of various kinds and even Africans (I think it's a Kenyan tribe). The Africans were hilarious. They have more common sense than most Americans it seems, probably because they have no time for delusion.Parts of this documentary are disturbing. There is evil in the world. There are insane people. And sometimes insane ideas become massively popular. Mental illness can become celebrated. Speaking common sense or even *questioning* certain ideas can get you labelled all kinds of horrible things. That's how much the movement matters. The truth is the first casualty.The only thing is, the people who need to see this won't. And even a sharp movie like this can do little against years of indoctrination. In a world where the ability or even motivation to use logic is so rare, you can barely try to convince anyone.But Walsh is doing a great job. And I learned a lot from this, especially about the underpinning of modern ""gender identity"" theory. I hope he keeps fighting the good fight.",False
12,10,"As a feminist and as a ""leftist"" - Thank you!",sewi-kadr,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw the trailer a couple of times during the year and I never really knew what this documentary was about. It peaked my interest but from the trailer, I thought I would just see an angry, trump loving far right winger who has no interest in finding out the truth but to just ignite frustration and drama.Boy, was I wrong.This movie, opened my eyes even more. It did confirm a lot of the thoughts and feelings I have towards this subject and honestly as a feminist, a liberal and a socialist, I agree with him fully.The documentary was well done but I wish they would've given them more budget because this deserved more. More interviews. Panels, discussions, and personal stories. Plenty of good information but a lot more could've been done.It deserves 10 stars because it tells the truth.",False
13,6,Sound but manipulative,maros612,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though Matt starts asking good questions, makes many valid points, and even manages to come up with witty ways to poke fun at absurd views and statements, the narrative soon enough changes into vehicle of biased, ideological propaganda. Even though I agree that the ""woke"" approach to gender is insincere, notably dishonest, it does not allow free discussion, it does not correspond with the actual findings of genuine scientific research, and thus is biased as well, the documentary paints the picture that all people willing to accept anything beyond ""fox-news"" definition of gender, are basically idiots with malignant agenda. Conservative interviewees chosen for the documentary are educated and sound, and those selected to oppose happen to be confused, clueless or completely derranged. Even though I do agree with the message, the way it is communicated is suggestive and manipulative, which does not meet the standard of a honest documentary. I rate it 6/10.",False
14,1,Just asking questions? Or does it have no answers?,alexacton-54569,n/a,16/08/2025,"For a film that was meant to be the thesis statement for the American conservative movement's opposition to trans liberation, it is almost devoid of substance. There is no real discussion on the rather small body of literature on gender affirming care. The biased choice of interviewees causes the ""owns"" and ""gotchas"" to fall flat and makes it feel as though Matt Walsh is just trying to do his best impression of early 00's Daily Show interviews.The frequent and convenient logical missteps to try and push forward its handful of arguments leaves much to be desired. Despite repeatedly stating that gender dysphoria is a mental illness the film makes ever effort to avoid acknowledging that transitioning is the treatment for that illness. Instead the audience is left with virtue signalling about mental illness rather than any exploration of how trans people can be helped. The film's failure to accomplish its goals is just another loss in the culture war for a political movement that has nothing to offer Americans. It becomes a stark reminder that Republican's hyper-focus on ""trans-ideology"" because they have no real ideas for leading a country.",False
15,10,Confused and sad about the world we're in,inricdemelnibone,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt hurt me that a man has to look for what a woman is and no woman was able to answer. Once again we have been silenced and made invisible.This madness has reached its limits, it is a minority that does not allow women to express themselves, I cannot even raise their voice when there is something as unfair as competing against a man in sports. Professional women have to shut up so as not to be hated for telling the truth. Children being abused by doctors who should protect them. The old feminists fought to have their achievements recognized because their husbands took their achievements as their own. Now we have men taking our places because they perceive themselves as women. I've seen zebra women before. I respect who you are and how you feel, I also call you what you want. But that won't change how you were born.",True
16,10,Very insightful,tiffanyrdow,n/a,16/08/2025,"No matter where you land on the political spectrum, I really recommend giving this a watch.It's very eye opening about today's culture and some of the things that we may not want to look at.",False
17,8,An adult female,sateigdraleah,n/a,16/08/2025,"The fact that we live in a world where a question like this is not only asked but people, especially many women in this documentary, can't seem to be able to answer is mind blowing. Great documentary. The truth sets people free.",False
18,8,Good but could have done better,edlaxton,n/a,16/08/2025,"On the plus sideinterviewed a lot of solemn, pious academics who could not give a non-circular answer to the question ""what is a woman?""Gapsnot much investigative zeal; very partisandid not present the evidence from the UK, Swedish, Finnish and French medical regulators who are raising doubts about treating adolescents with puberty blockers and steroids. Lost opportunity to challenge American gender zealots.",False
19,n/a,Critics have no reviews?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is there a reason no critics have even watched this film or given it a review? They couldn't even take the time to watch it, critique it, and give it a zero rating? Are they unable to make any strong arguments about why they do not like this film? Are they refusing to watch it as some sort of protest against the subject matter? It is shameful and sad and it shows their true colors. What other reviews by the critics are tainted by their own ideology? I trust the reviews from the people much more than the reviews by the critics. The critics have lost all credibility with the general public. Sad state of affairs.",False
20,1,Cringe,ournh,n/a,16/08/2025,"Came across this 'docu' accidentally, it turned out to be partisan bullocks. Rather than listening to interviewees,
Matt Walsh prefers to ridicule anybody that gives answer different to his expectations. He does it to prove his 'truth' as he calls it, though don't expect much of an explanation why this truth is so. Instead expect cringe compilation coming from guy for whom understanding anybody's point of view or emotions it too difficult. Maybe he watched Borat and thought it was a real documentary?The Room kind of cringe is the prevailing emotion I've had watching it, it stems from that persistence to not understand another human being, if you are into that then go ahead.Protip: read the reviews to check if you are ready for this kind of cringe.",False
21,6,Interesting stuff but that is not a documentary.,Stranger_Ironfoot,n/a,16/08/2025,"My problem with this was the fact that it suggests it is a documentary trying to question some stuff, a presenter seeking answers, traveling the world to listen to different opinions.That is simply not the truth.The narrator already knows what he believes, he has a solid opinion and at no point does he seem to be open to discussion and to actually listen to the people he interviews.The so called documentary is just a way for the narrator to promote his ideas about certain matters. Whether I agree with him or not, he is just not doing what he said he would be doing, which disappointed me a lot.",False
22,1,Insightful documentary into the minds of transphobes,tharunprabhu,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved the part where Matt meets with the Maasai tribe (a primitive community where women are treated as slaves and childbearing machines and one in which female genital mutilation is still rampant) and asks them what they think a woman is.There is also a scene in this propaganda piece where a professor gives an in-depth and nuanced answer to Matt's question about the differences between gender and sex. But instead of showing us that, Matt decides to time-lapse over that answer with some dreamy music playing in the background. He couldn't make it more blatantly clear what his goals with this ""documentary"" were, could he? I guess his primitive brain is able to comprehend and appreciate only rudimentary answers like male genitalia equals men and female genitalia equals women.",False
23,10,"Truth, Reality and Fact",rodapernites,n/a,16/08/2025,"The truth and nothing but the truth! This documentary presents the truth, facts and reality of this absolute madness about gender identity! It made me want to fight for and protect my children even more! Every parent needs to see it! Every gay or transgender person needs to hear every bit of it! Facts don't care about your feelings but I would rather live in a world of truth and reality than in a world full of lies and delusion. It makes me furious how government and big people silence the truth and oppress those who oppose this madness. Enough is enough! Women need to speak and fight for their rights too!",False
24,10,Truth,sakidaca,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe lowest point for me whas the feminist prostest where no one wanted to say/ didn't know what a woman is. Or maybe the university professor. Or a pediatrician.Why is it ok for the minority to be so aggressive against the majority, so that today we can't even have the definition of a woman becouse of a trend? Yes, there really are people trapped in the wrong body, pepole born with both male and female reproductive organs. But not like 5 out of 10 people like it seems to be today.Nothing against someone feeling/ wanting to be a cat or a cactus, but don't force me to call you a cactus. Lets be objective sometimes.Hopefully this American bull*hit has not come to where i live in Europe yet, and hopefully by the time it can arrive, it will not be trendy anymore.",True
25,10,great documentary.,rojckaya,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very educational and presented in an informative and non-hateful way. Very good, would recommend, worth watching and very insteresting. I like how matt provides facts and also interviews so many different people. He talks about out topics that are seen as normal by many of my peers and the younger generation, but are actually the cause of many modern world problems that are not talked about enough and are too often mistaken for something good, a solution even.i hope that more people see this in the future. 'what is a woman?' is a documentary that people should watch regardless of their political view or beliefs about gender. It is a way of seeing things from another perspective and i guarantee - you will learn something from it.",False

1,9,Songs Remember When,imdbfan-3807036205,n/a,17/08/2025,"I had the opportunity to see this film during the Denver Dragon Boat Film Festival.The story touches so many points through the tapestry of 'New Wave' music that tied many Vietnamese youth together in a very tumultuous and transitional time in the US.A good film showing the generational pendulum of family drama and blame; our attempt to to course correct, as well as the internal conflicts of shedding the ways of non-US lineage versus assimilation to the US that have been going on for a hundred years or more, while not discounting the experiences and trauma of the generations before and completely forgetting our lineages -- both the good and the bad -- which adds to the vibrancy of the US through food, art, language, and music.The film does a good job of showing things we can only see through our own age, eyes, and perspectives when we are young and ""in it"" and how they shift in time as we age and can finally understand and see things - both good and bad - with age and perspective.I think this film will touch the hearts and minds of most Americans that see it.",False

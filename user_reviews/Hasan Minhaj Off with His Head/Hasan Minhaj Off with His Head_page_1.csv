1,8,Funny and smart,seraichyk,n/a,15/08/2025,"Who is giving this a 1 and why?? This guy is so funny and smart. Every line, every insight... funny, engaging. He manages to make very controversial points, without offending anyone.Would love to know who is dissing this and why. Does he hit a nerve on racial subjects? I'm so confused that anyone could find him offensive.I love all the insights on cultural issues.I was engaged and entertained from beginning to endThe dog section is so spot on and funny.Just guessing that there are conservatives offended with the swearing?Audience is filled with highly entertained, engaged people... wish some of them would leave a review.",False
2,8,As a 68 year old White Man...,ocmacman,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well it took me a minute to adjust my perspective, to open my mind as it were. I really enjoyed his performance, it was provocative to be sure. I am a firm believer that race and cultures will always find a way to be at odds from a narrow perspective. We're born and raised in an environment to protect ourselves from hate and harm from outsiders.When someone so gracefully shines a bright light on all the idiosyncrasies without malice, it makes for great entertainment. A bit uncomfortable and threatening at first, a real skill in comedic delivery keep up the good work. You've got a new fan in me.",False
3,8,I enjoyed it,raisitanshu,n/a,15/08/2025,"Funny and insightful. Connected with me as an Indian who is somewhat familiar with US, history and it's cultural idiosyncrasies in this period. I laughed a lot and got a bit emotional.To be completely honest was also a bit annoyed by the extremely loud and manic performance. I know most of the emotional core of this performance relies on convincing us of his manic problems, but it just too damn loud. Else it would've been 9/10 for me.PS: Compelled to write the review by the surprise of such lowly rated reviews (1/2/.... I mean everyone in the audience seemed to genuinely have a great time. I understand that it does not bear the genius of rich wordplay or the brilliantly observant (but safe) situational comedy of Seinfeld or LD. Nor does it exhibit the sheer brilliance in jokes, craft and effortlessness of Louis C. K. or the Chris Rock of old but it's good and well worth the watch.",False
4,10,His best one so far,nancyism,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have no idea why he got so many negative reviews that's why I felt compelled to write one review on IMDb to even out the playing field .I thought he was brilliant, intelligent, insightful, honest and most of all hysterical. And yes he is loud and throws around a stool, it's called dramatic effect. Extremely relevant and very relatable the issues he brings up, being a father, being a son and being an American. Thank you Hasan for once again pointing out what is obviously wrong witch your comical yet quick witted, sharp brilliance. I gave it a ten because I found absolutely no fault with the standup.",False
5,10,A Geopolitical Masterpiece -- MUST WATCH!,donabellita,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a psychologist and someone in an interracial relationship, my husband and I were screaming laughing at Hasan's latest performance! His jokes about ""boundaries"" and ""couples therapy"" literally had tears rolling down our faces! The stereotypes were hilariously accurate based on our lived experience, and Hasan has made me proud to be an Indian-American. Anyone who doesn't think Off With His Head was comedic genius clearly doesn't understand the niche California/immigrant/millennial sense of humor. His crowd work was also incredible! I love how the immigrant archetypes were perfectly placed throughout the crowd. So so so funny. Hasan has done it again! A political genius.",False
6,2,The Indian Kevin Hart,TerribleMovie,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hasan Minhaj has a serious case of Kevin Hart syndrome: thinking loud is funny. He screams at the top of his lungs while beating a stool within an inch of its life. He says his therapist calls him manic, which perfectly describes his stage presence. Hasan is all over the place in this special: yelling about immigrants, killing off the elderly, ignoring poor people. He even throws in a Kobe Bryant helicopter crash joke which changed the whole energy in the audience. He says mean things for shock value, which makes him come across as unlikable. Instead of wit, we get manic rambling and awkward audience interactions. Hasan does a lot of talking without saying anything; and no amount of manic screaming can save him. This special is awful.",False
7,10,"Not everyone's cup of tea, But if you like Chai, then you like Chai.",gsn-coldfire,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Hasan Minhaj's *Off With His Head* isn't for everyone, and that's part of its charm. If you like your comedy bold and your tea strong, then you'll find a lot to savor here. Minhaj's energy can feel a bit intense, even overly rehearsed at times, but for fans, it's all part of his style-a mix of animated storytelling and hard-hitting punchlines. He doesn't shy away from digging into the intricacies of 'Beige-istan,' peeling back layers of what it means to be caught between cultures, and the truths he shares often sting as much as they entertain.The show is cleverly crafted, with jokes and stories weaving seamlessly into each other, creating a narrative that's both deeply personal and widely relatable. Minhaj balances humor with vulnerability, addressing issues from identity and family to ambition and hypocrisy. While he toes the line between self-deprecating and self-aggrandizing, he ultimately lands on self-aware, giving the audience a fresh perspective on the immigrant experience.For those willing to embrace his style, *Off With His Head* offers an insightful and unfiltered journey through Hasan's mind, one that may be too strong for some, in which case just don't watch it.",False
8,1,"I used to be a fan, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME :(",upside-down-banana,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've been a fan of him for so long. I've spent a solid amount of money on supporting him, including going to his live shows. I have watched all his daily show sets. I've watched almost every youtube show and interview he has been in. This stand up special is most definitely his worst piece of work yet. It is sad and disappointing but kind of inevitable idk. I found some of his jokes to be making fun of others in an unsavory way, but not sure if an aging, straight, wealthy millenial man understands this sort of nuance with modern comedy. He doesn't get a free pass because he's the child of immigrants, there's plenty of immigrant gen-z comedians who don't make boring jokes about other more oppressed groups. And if they do, they are actually funny. He's also gotten way too rehearsed with his delivery and timing. Glad he's able to support his family but its time to move on to a new role in media.",False
9,n/a,Psychopathic rants of a washed up comedian with added fake laugh tracks,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hasan Minhaj used to be funny, and I got excited when I saw the news that this stand-up special was being released, but when I watched half of it, I was completely disappointed!It looks like after he lost the Daily Show gig, he developed mental issues. How were these psychopathic rants allowed on Netflix?Ranting way too long about killing senior citizens so bigger houses become available for young people to buy.And asking for elderly politicians like specifically like ""Nancy Pelosi"" and ""RBG if she had survived"" to be brought ""into a shed and put bullets into their skulls"" just like ""they should've done to Tom Brady""Only 10% of the audience is laughing, but the laugh tracks that were obviously added in post-production don't match the crowd's reaction.",False
10,8,I'd give 10 if not the stupid dog joke,Ani_,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI haven't laugh this hard for so long. Great content, I love when the humor/jokes also send a message to the audience. There was a lot to read in between the lines.Was unique and greatly done except he had to listen to his friend about the dog joke. Although I can see how that has some truth to it with certain people but generalizing and making it a joke wasn't funny. I'm sorry if he has time understanding that dogs are family to some people & the reason for us loving them is their genuine and unconditional love, not because dogs are dumb.I understand to not read too much into a joke, but it was just a stupid one so I had to point out. Hasan next time listen to your friends, when they tell you leave some jokes out just do it!",True
11,9,An immigrants' perspective on the American dream,waqariffiadelaide,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hassan represents the experience of the Indian people in the West to a T.Funny, fresh and consistent, is what you get with Hassan. I normally do not write reviews, but I felt obliged to do so in this case, because of the few 1 star reviews.The only explanation I have for them is that perhaps some of the audiences could not completely relate with Hassan's experiences. I on the other hand found myself laughing and nodding along. It is probably not as hard hitting as some of his earlier material, but it is still in typical Hassan Minhaj style special.So give it a chance and keep an open mind.",False
12,1,Off with this show,Roma73,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love humour of all sorts, among which dark, progressive, dangerous, stinging, painful, sharp, absurdist, darker than dark, and the list goes on. I don't need to ""like"" the person up on that stage. I don't need to imagine them as a friend, should we chance upon meeting. I might even imagine disliking them, or even fearing them, were our paths to cross, while still digging their humour. But - just as with fictional book or film characters - I do need to find them and the things they share at least a little bit interesting.Hasan Minhaj (in this particular show, at least) does not interest me in the slightest. He reminds me of those people one evades in coffee corners, the untalented, uncreative airheads who think themselves hilarious, finding an audience only in other airheads.",False
13,1,Zzzzz,akira-hideyo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Used to love his incredible wit and punch lines and insightful digs at anyone and everyone deserving of wearing his skakedowns and T-Bagging shades. After 30 mins, I stopped tolerating his spiral into chronic self indulgent glorification of his brown superiority and seemingly droning into the 100 metres sprint dash lane to compete for a taste of carving past Trump's notoriety to be news worthy eternal. That's the trouble with all these fast rising delusional attention seeking climb ons. They don't just burn out, they implode. He boasted that he used to end his shows putting others down, aka stomping on Ronny Chieng for being a cop out. That itself is a giant red flag of someone's true inner character on how he plans to get ahead in life, at the expense of others. Too bad, time to get a day job. 😱😞🙄",False
14,1,Is this how a midlife crisis looks?,dililith,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was such a disappointment. I have been a fan of his work for years, I have always though he had a way to be funny and introspective, but this one has something different. He managed to not be funny and actually be offensive through the entire show, I did not laugh once, but I found myself saying at least a dozen times ""wow, that was messed up"". You can actually see it in the audience, they were uncomfortable, the tension in the room was palpable through the screen. I really hope he can see how he messed up, and that this is just a bad show and not the beginning of his end, because truly he used to be good.",False
15,2,I used to be a huge fan,rishipoddar-s,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolutely Disappointing. Reading the title and description, I was expecting him to deliver some kind of apology for the lies in his first Netflix special. If you don't remember, those lies were not jokes. The people he lied about had to face a lot of hate and bullying. Hasan shows no remorse for those lies, while he is sorry for expecting Ellen to pronounce his name correctly.The quality of his comedy has clearly gone down. I chuckled only twice during the entire special. Not worth watching. I could clearly tell that many of the ""laughs"" in the show were fake. He somehow managed to offend every ethnicity.",False

1,7,Interesting but Bill Night's voice is SO dull!,peterday-75700,n/a,15/08/2025,"Shows great places, and gives ideas of places to visit. Lovely scenery but dull commentary.",False
2,10,Outstanding series,ajeffre,n/a,15/08/2025,"A magnificent series. I read a comment complaining about Bill Nighy's boring voice. Not true for those who prefer the narrator NOT to intrude on content by taking attention away from the extraordinary visuals and fascinating written material.Apparently I need to add more praise in order to meet the required word count. With pleasure: I rate the series a 10 not only for visual impact via drone but for charming and informative interviews, historical plus contemporary data and suggesting many of us have plenty to learn and appreciate about the natural world --- so much of it is lost to technology gone bonkers.",False
3,1,Nazi washing.,TamMtl,n/a,15/08/2025,"Was gobsmacked by the bit about the region's World War Two historical reference in which they present the ""fallen German soldiers"" as some sort of tragedy to the town rather than the viscous Nazi soldiers they actually were. The American German woman they interview is mournful for the loss of their lives rather that for those they slaughtered, as though they were heroes.Had they had been resisters to one of the humanity's most despicable regimes that industrialized the slaughter of innocent human beings, then that might have been a reasonable moment of mourning.This may be a massive paid tourism ad but it could at least be truthful in its history.",False

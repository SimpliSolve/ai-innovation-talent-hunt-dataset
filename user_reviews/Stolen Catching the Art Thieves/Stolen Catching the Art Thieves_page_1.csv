1,7,A thought provoking insight into some really quite simple crimes,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Art theft is a peculiar activity: famous works of art are essentially unsellable, but they can be ransomed back to their original owners. This is a delicate and ethically dubious process: this series tells the stories of three famous thefts, all of which resulted in the eventual return of the art, but in two cases with complications. The stories are interesting, though in most cases the crimes themselves are very simple: it's easy to steal something set out on public display. The details of the negotiations, however, are only alluded to and not fully revealed. Also the narration is a bit overdone: twice the narrator refers to ""Oslo's notorious east side"" and a quick read on the internet reveals that that this gives a rather exagerrated indications of Oslo's social divide. The series does make you think, but there's slightly less to see here than first meets the eye.",False

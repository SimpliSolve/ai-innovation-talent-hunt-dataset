1,9,Very Convincing Movie,celik-663-685980,n/a,16/08/2025,"Altough I do spearfishing and so be familiar with the sea habitad and watched a lot of movies against culling sharks, I was not really convinced that they must be protected. The arguments are clearly expressed and the movie technique is very good. Thanks to people who made the good work.",False
2,9,They get you in the end,jaw-1981,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film is brilliantly narrated by Bana giving a very Australian feel, to what is a problem close to home. The film is well thought out, convincing of its message and has some epic and confronting images underwater.By then end you are just confused why our government is so afraid of positive change.",False
3,10,Be their Envoy!,stlcardsjordan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I live in America and had no idea that one of the most important places to the survival of sharks has been mass murdering them for years. It's time people understood if you get in the water expect to see sharks, just like if you go the Serengeti you expect to see lions. The water is the sharks home, you are just a visitor, respect that or don't go in the water. Please watch this movie and sign the petition like me and so many others have!",False
4,10,Shark Culling needs to stop.,urluvedevr52,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're a shark lover or just an ocean marine life lover like myself then this documentary will really upset you. Australia is one of the only countries in the modern world to still be using the archaic system of using nets and or drum lines to entangle, trap and eventually kill sharks. Although it's original intention is to kill sharks it is not only sharks they are killing. These methods are also killing turtles, stingrays, whales and dolphins. Devolved in the 1930's these methods are out of date with the technology we have available to us today. Millions of sharks are killed by humans each year and sharks kill ten or less people each year. Many shark species are endangered and they need our protection. Without sharks in our worlds oceans our world here on land will cease to be the same. We need to protect sharks and every other creature living in the ocean to our best ability. Sharks have been around for 450 million years and we need them in order for our species to survive, we need them for the future of this planet. I hope we can someday live in harmony with these beautiful and majestic creatures, if not we're all doomed....",False
5,10,Really worth watching if you don't have any knowledge about sharks or other marine life,jessicavandijk-38917,n/a,16/08/2025,It's just blows my mind that a country as Australia is still using these marine life murdering systems. After all studies which shows it's not doing anything for the safety of humans or marine life:AUSTRALIA GOVERNMENT: PLEASE STOP DESTROYING ALL MARINE LIFE INCLUDING THE GREAT BARRIER REEF!!!!I really hope something will change now!,False
6,10,Everyone needs to see this!,michellelewis-17188,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether you are in Australia or not, this must be seen and shared, it's deeply upsetting for anyone with a love of marine life and our oceans, but it's so important to get this message out that such a barbaric and proven to be ineffective process is happening! At the end it gives details of how we can help and I implore everyone to do their bit; sign the petition, spread the word, help to try and get this devastating culling stopped. A brilliantly put together documentary with passionate advocates and scientists who are trying their hardest to get the deaf ears of government to listen to reason and sense.",False
7,10,Amazing Documentary,phoenixnelson-37674,n/a,16/08/2025,"This has educated me so much. I highly recommend watching this documentary. It has inspired me to want to step forward and help in anyway I can. I never realized how harsh and ignorant the Australian government is. If you want to know more about shark culling and what you can do help put an end to this, then watch this documentary. Very very inspiring.",False
8,10,STOP THE CULL!!!!!,xkwkdyhyhy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this documentary with my 8 yr old son, we cried so much! All the poor animals that are in these called ""people first nets"" is absolutely sad! Australia has some the most amazing conservationists on the planet! I grew up watching Steve Irwin and he taught me that ALL animals have a purpose on this planet! People entered animals environments and took away so much from animals already! We can't live in the ocean, we can't breath underwater with oxygen tanks and masks, we don't need the ocean away from marine life! If you love marine life or even if you don't this is a must watch movie/ documentary!!!!",False
9,10,Such an eye opening movie,themackattack99,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI clicked on the film to watch some shark week fun, little did I know I was about to be taught one of the saddest things I have ever seen. This movie opened my eyes to how little the government cares for marine life, or any wildlife really and how much they care for profits and control, it's disgusting really. Please watch at your own advisory because there are added clips of the sad endings of these beautiful animals and it's a lot on your heart, I know I was bawling at every clip, sad knowing I couldn't do anything to stop it. So please, at the end of the film there is a website, please go on and sign the petition to stop the entrapment of these harmless animals. It's the least we can do.",True
10,10,One of the best documentaries I've seen,sarah-93476,n/a,16/08/2025,"Extremely well-made, fantastic message. Great production value. Saw at a preview in Bondi and can't wait to watch again once it's on Stan.",False
11,10,Just Sickening!!!,madisonthompson-86369,n/a,16/08/2025,"I live in America and had no Idea that this is how other countries ""protect"" their people!!! Its sickening to listen to the cries and sounds these poor animals make. These nets need to be taken away for good! It's frustrating to watch and myself physically can't do anything and sadly neither can the divers! I wish they could help the ones that were still alive. I myself am fearful of sharks just knowing what they could do but I take the time to watch and learn all that I can because at the end of the day when going into the ocean you're entering these magnificent creatures homes. And it's a risk. Loved this ‚ù§ definitely posting and promoting this movie!!!",False
12,10,The truth exposed - finally!,rosy_reviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is something that has gone under the radar of public awareness for too long, but thanks to Envoy: Shark Cull the world is finally learning the truth.This film relays an important message about the cruelty to marine life that is unnecessarily happening, just 500m of our Aussie beaches, under the guise of the government beach-goer protection programs.Some amazing, though extremely disturbing, underwater scenes. Also showcases the beauty of the ocean and it's animals. Emotional and honest moments portrayed by the cast. Genuinely moving.Instead of dragging the chain, Aussie governments should be riding the wave of innovation - the message is clear.",False
13,10,now that is what i call a documentary !!,JonanthanNewOrleans,n/a,16/08/2025,"Extremely well done, exposing some absolutely cruel and barbaric behaviors by the government, this has to stop!!10/10.",False
14,10,Must watch,deanrharrison,n/a,16/08/2025,Incredible film highlighting the need to remove the nets from Australian waters.,False
15,10,Eye opening,samanthakraak,n/a,16/08/2025,This was such a great film! It had me in tears at points seeing how shark nets affect the ocean life. I learnt so much and continue to tell others about the film so they can learn too. Everyone needs to know!,False
16,10,Very eye opening,sarahaborell,n/a,16/08/2025,"A must watch, especially for Australians. You need to be aware of what is happening in our oceans.",False
17,10,WTF,campagna-04770,n/a,16/08/2025,This doco was so eye opening and people need to see it to understand the terrible things happening to our ocean life! This literally made me cry at how sad and terrible this is. Australia's government need to STOP!!! Watch. This Doco to really get the full picture!,False
18,10,A MUST SEE for all tourists to Australia,qldmumma,n/a,16/08/2025,Very eye opening and a must for all tourists to Australia to watch and learn.Australian politicians should be ashamed.,False
19,10,Such an important doco for the sharks,jonathanclark-79120,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary brings together a number of people to speak for the sharks, includes balanced scientific views, the raw data and presents solutions. It has been built on many years of dedicated work by the 'envoys' involved and tells their story clearly - it has done what none of the individual envoys or the organisations could do on their own.It has been beautifully put together and needs to reach millions.Please, on watching this documentary, undertake to take on at least some of the calls to action presented at the end.",False
20,10,If only more people knew...,acoles-63123,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't believe anyone in Qld would really want these nets left in the water, if they knew the damage they do to the wildlife, while not really having any positive impact on swimmer/surfer safety.This film makes a great point, in a really good way. No sensational hand waving, just facts and sensible solutions...
Watch it, then share with your friends.",False
21,10,Eye opening and compelling,sarahhandebeaux,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such an important topic that is carefully deconstructed showing the reality of the nets and how they DO NOT keep you safe, and offering real solutions. Some scenes were so powerful I don't think I will ever forget. Highly recommended.",False
22,10,About time for a change,buchpetzer-78868,n/a,16/08/2025,The pressure humans put on marine life is tremendous. Seeing how Australia is treating its marine life is alarming and difficult to watch. Endangered species are caught in the nets or on the drumline and suffer several hours before they die. Only a very small amount of the catch is the target species which are also endangered.Using inefficient nets to create a false sense of security for humans enjoying the oceans by harming and killing marine life is not a way a civilised nation like Australia should act. I hope the australian people speak up and end this. There are better ways to enjoy the oceans with its inhabitants.,False
23,10,Must watch doco,megankeyte,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is extremely well done and a must watch. We are naturally afraid of what we don't know and can't see. This doco provides context, education, an insight into the political agenda. It provides awareness to the fact that the drum lines are providing swimmers with a false sense of security and in fact they're more detrimental than anyone could have imagined.",False
24,10,Future of US,allisonmontgomery,n/a,16/08/2025,"As humans we tend to pull from facts and documentary genres that intice the truth in other countries. As a firm advocate for real change, I was outright disappointed and baffled by the treatment of our marine life. ENVOY exposes the hidden truth of shark culling and Hooks being used to destroy our world. WE ALL MUST DEFEND THE ECONOMY OF EARTH and to do so WE NEED TO JOIN IN PROTECT ALL WATERS FROM DESTRUCTION AND MAYHEM. WATCH ENVOY and open your eyes to the Australian governments vast hysteria and fear of marine beings. PLAY YOUR PART IN SAVING THIS PLANET because WHEN MARINE ECONOMY DIES SO WILL ALL LIVING BEINGS.",False
25,10,Wow üò≥,gapeach-73566,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary has been recommended to many people. It was news to me to hear about this and I will never be the same! #TeamWildlife.,False

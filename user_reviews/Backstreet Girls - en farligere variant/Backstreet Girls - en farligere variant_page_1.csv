1,8,It's only rock'n roll but I like it,nandel-41900,n/a,16/08/2025,"Aging norwegian rockers Backstreet Girls just want to gig and make music, however the pandemic cancels everything.Will they survive as a band and will there still be an audiance?It's no nonsense, candid and real. The boys drink, smoke and play rock as they have for 40 years now.They are quite sympathetic and honest in their approach to life. There are no scandals or upsets, the biggest controversy is when they are prohibited to drink and smoke on stage by an event organizer. They of course do both.It's a fun trip and when it's over you wish there was more, I liked it and I liked the guys!",False

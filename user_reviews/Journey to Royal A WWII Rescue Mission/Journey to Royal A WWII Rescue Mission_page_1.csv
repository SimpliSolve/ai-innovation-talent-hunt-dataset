1,5,Worth watching once,cjskama-956-515706,n/a,15/08/2025,"The re-enactments and visuals were top notch. But far too many talking heads for my tastes. Worth checking out, but keep the remote handy to fast forward the boring parts.",False
2,10,Great film; Labor of love by the filmmaker! A story/stories that needed to be told,brookaurand,n/a,15/08/2025,"Highly recommended for those that love true accounts of World War II men that truly are heroes! This film told a story /stories about rescue missions that I had never heard about. My father has watched every WWII movie, series and documentary that he can get his hands on, and this film told a story he had never seen or had heard of before. Such a giant labor of love by the filmmaker, and told with rich emotion and warmth from his perspective, as well as those that are interviewed. Movie has a really intense opening sequence I won't forget anytime soon. Thank you for telling this story.",False
3,10,An Exceptionally Well Made Documentary In Every Way!,silicontourist,n/a,15/08/2025,"To begin with I think the title of this action documentary should have been, 'A WW2 ROYAL RESCUE MISSION'
Film documentaries, about times in the past history of humanity etc, are made to inform you of something you don't know (or want to find out more) anything about. Whether or not you find them to have done their jobs for you is the important point and, NOT if you enjoyed it or not; which, if you did, is a bonus! One reviewer makes the comment that there were too many people interviewed (based upon what he said, I believe its because he/she wants to see more action footage instead etc) and, you should keep the remote handy for fast forwarding. What a typically modern day selfish attitude to a cinematic release.A story of this magnitude being told by survivors, personnel and family etc is lucky to have as many people as possible who could give details and fact to the piece of history! As for myself, I think this is one of the best made - and real - informative documentaries I have ever watched (and at my elderly age I can tell you I have seen well over a thousand at the very least). As with most American documentaries about WW2, this director did not have one bit of the American style gloating attitude of, ""We won the war all by ourselves"". Instead he produced it as a very respectful, and reverent, footage that projected the great sadness and loss that a great many people/families suffered because of that awful war.I believe (IMHO) that the greater majority of people who see this compelling tale, will find it most interesting, fascinating, informative and subsequently very enjoyable; regardless of how many people are talking in it! It brought a few tears to my eyes, believe me, but some of them were for the fact that humanity has not learned a single thing from its barbaric past...and it never will!",False
4,10,Outstanding!,alphatdelta,n/a,15/08/2025,Really like the recreation and interviews with the actual crew involved. It was one of those movies I didn't want to end. Bet there were many more stories to be told. Glad the interviews were captured before time caught up with all of them. An 11 out of 10 stars.,False
5,10,Best 90 minutes I've spent in a long time,juphold-65302,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI came to see this by chance. It was not a film I would have sought out to watch, but I am better for having seen it. These are real people telling us about real events that they lived through. Most of which we will never be able to comprehend fully.This is a beautiful and engaging film. The 'butterfly effect' is in full force here: one decision and the ripples it made decades after.I am not a 'history buff.' This film allowed me to connect to a historical event in a way I have not been able to previously. It challenged me to think about what our servicemen experienced, and at such young ages, when I have never had those thoughts before.The Journey to Royal is a beautiful, thoughtful tribute to heroes. They are relatable, fallible, and should be unforgettable. Great work like this will ensure they, and their sacrifices, are never forgotten.",True
6,n/a,WWII History Not To Be Forgotten,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAn entertaining as well as educational film about a little known aspect of WWII, which was the rescue squadrons. You will want to watch it over and over again. A real gem. Very worthwhile.",True

1,8,Too big to fail,kosmasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"Or is it fall? Whatever the case - no pun intended. I have to admit, I probably would have missed this, if a friend didn't tip me off about it. That said, if you are not really a football fan (or soccer if you are American I reckon), you may not have ... well an in to the movie. If you are and like the Premier League too ... well you probably have heard of this tall guy.Peter Crouch - he is no Lionel Messi or Christiano Ronaldo ... he is very aware of that. He is a rock solid player though ... actually once he gets rolling ... there seems not stopping him .. he's a robot like that (sorry for that pun, but you'll understand ... when you see it).That all said, this is a well edited and filmed behind the scenes of a player that does not take himself too seriously ... and I assume that will make more than just a handful people watching this ...",False
2,8,What a beautiful man you are Peter Crouch,olcayozfirat,n/a,15/08/2025,"Biographical documentary film produced by Amazon in 2023. A narration by Peter Crouch, one of the most interesting and famous players in the world, from the beginning to the end of his football life by himself, his family, friends and coaches. As you watch, you learn how she is excluded and despised due to her physique, and as she becomes successful over time, how sympathetic she is and a source of morale for her teammates. It's never boring to watch. I experienced the stress of not scoring goals for those weeks while watching it. Also, although I know him as a Besiktas fan, I did not know that he had such a successful career.Let me also say that I watched Robot Dance with a smile.",False
3,7,One of the oddest players in Premier League history,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""That Peter Crourh Film"" (2023 release from the UK; 86 min) opens, Crouch is getting ready to take a penalty kick for Liverpool, which he misses as the Liverpool supporters groan. We then go back in time to the mid-90s when a Tottenham talent scout takes notice of the 14 yo ""lanky striker"" and signs hom. At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the first feature-length from British documentary maker Benjamin Hirsch. Here he reassesses the ups (in plural) and downs (also in plural) of a most unlikely soccer plays that was the 6ft7 Peter Crouch. As a pretty die-hard soccer fan in general, I was vaguely aware who he was but seeing it all laid out in this documentary, one cannot help but respect and admire Crouch. And also this: British soccer fans are pretty mean if not worse. I didn't realize that Crouch set the record for most headed goals in the Premier League's history. This documentary also makes clear that outside of soccer, Crouch seems to be a ""jolly good fella"". Bottom line: he is a winner all around, and so is this super-enjoyable documentary.""That Peter Crouch Film"" recently started streaming on Amazon Prime, and I finally watched it last night. If you are a soccer fan, or simply interested in learning more about one of the oddest players in Premier League history, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,9,"He's big, he's red, an inspiration I said! Peter Crouch",dazs88,n/a,15/08/2025,"A Brilliant doco for everyone who feels they don't fit in or aren't the ""norm"", please watch this and let it light up your life.A great film of striving against adversity, believing in yourself and your abilities, shooting for the moon and landing amongst the stars.Of which, Pete is truly a shining example to everyone... A genuine character of the modern game, not cut from the same cloth as the generic players, they needed more for his infectious personality.Packed full of legends of the game, great insights, brutal honesty and big laughs, I love Crouchy even more, and being a life long red, I love the fella alot.Bravo Pete...",False
5,10,An enjoyable watch and real insight to his life in football,rjp-56713,n/a,15/08/2025,"I remember watching Peter crouch through his time with Liverpool, England and later years. What this documentary shows is the struggles that he has had to go through to get there and how it shaped his career.The abuse he received, the self doubt which affected his game and made him question if he would make it as a professional footballer are all laid bare. He ended up winning the fans and myself over in the end with his performances, and it's evident how much of a likeable character he is not only in the dressing room but on the terraces and in public.This documentary shows him to be a class act, and I really enjoyed seeing the connection he has with his wife Abby and his family. The support they have given him is evident, but seeing how the abuse he received early on his career affected him and his family brings home the impact of what you say or do can have on others.I found it to be a great documentary for football lovers, for me the film shows the human side of footballers and in this case Peter Crouch. Top guy top story.üëçüëç",False
6,10,Brilliant,tomjburns-57852,n/a,15/08/2025,"Seriously good documentary about a life that like most humans has ups and downs but for most of us the downs are not in the public eye. He had some key people in his life that gave him the chances and the time to break through and gain the confidence he needed to show the football world that he deserved to be in the pitch. Harry Rednapp, Benitez and Erickson but a few. Crazy to see the brutal diatribe that the gutter press wrote about such a young guy who looked different just to sell papers. He got the last laugh with a great playing career, a great family and a post football career. What a great personality and long May his success continue. Great documentary!",False
7,10,Really enjoyed it.,crtlee,n/a,15/08/2025,I put it on as background noise to go to sleep to but ended up watching start to finish. Being Welsh its always bothered me England fans booing their own players cause they have always had good players but that boo crouchy had was horrible and he still felt like he had a point to prove and that's exactly what he did even know he didn't ow them fans who booed him anything. What a player and real good watch gutted they didn't show the clip of him partying in Ibiza few back on there that would of gone down a treat. These next few words are just me getting to the 600 minimum letters now. Night all.,False

1,10,Remember,jenitrevestherapy,n/a,17/08/2025,"A sensitive, beautiful film, and as a white middle class woman, having seen it twice, the story is vital to tell. We still live in a society that does not hear these stories. We remain ""asleep"" to our white ancestors. We are deaf to black history. I wept, and felt deep shame.Anina tells the story with soul. And the story is not over. I wonder if it ever will be.A must for universities/schools/ and anyone interested in truth telling and true history. Especially as we here in the UK remain witness to racism and ignorance of our shared ancestral history/her story.The film is sensitively shot. There are moments of stillness and beauty, shame and ugly truth.You cannot avoid being changed somehow, as you leave the cinema.A must see.",False

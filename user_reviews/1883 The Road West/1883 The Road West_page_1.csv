1,10,My all time favorite western!!,Denncoa,n/a,16/08/2025,"Taylor Sheridan is a god of photography and story telling! This miniseries is full of action, emotional ups and downs, fantastic photography and an incredible story. I was impressed with Tim and Faith's performances but I was blown away by Isabell May's performance. She was incredible! I'm so glad Taylor chose her again to narrate the next chapter of the Dutton's story, 1923.The script feels so authentic and the hardships portrayed are as real as everything I've read about life on the Oregon Trail. Bandits, weather, natives and animals were all out to get the pioneers. The true grit of those people is something that our modern society could learn from. Every single day on the trail was a struggle to survive!",False
2,9,Heaven,pradtrip,n/a,16/08/2025,"Heaven
There is a moment where you dreams and your memories merge together & form a Perfect World.That is heaven.& each heaven is unique. It is the world of you.The land is filled with all you hold dear & the sky is your imagination.Freedom...
To most, it is an idea. An abstract thought that pertains to control.That not freedom.That's independence.Freedom is riding wild over untamed land. With no notion any moment exists. Beyond the one you are living.1883.Beautiful, Mesmerizing, Awesome.Must watch for all good content lovers, Amazingly well created, directed, & acted. Love to watch the next season.",False
3,3,Not good,niels-vanloon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBeautiful scenery and atmospere, also beautifully depicted. However, the fact that the main character Elsa, needs to be turned into the great plain matrass for each guy she meets is representative of our current society. Shame it is overlayed in the story.Apart from that, the dynamic is rather slow in general. Would have been good to limit the monologues Elsa provides a bit more.All in all a decent watch, definately not a wast of time, but there are some things you have to overlook.As a, in my opinion, better alternative, I can suggest American Primeval. Very comparable in ""theme""/""feel"" of the show, but more in pace with the late 1800's.",True

1,10,A compelling documentary,alffsteinberger,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is riveting from start to finish.
Many difficult moments, perhaps the most difficult is witnessing David's conversation with a denier of these atrocities. Kudos to David Baddiel for maintaining his composure during this talk. Chilling indeed!
Such documentaries are not easy to watch - but I am glad that I did.
10 STARS!",False
2,3,Deeply misleading presentation of an important topic,stephen-cowley-910-497274,n/a,16/08/2025,"I give it two marks because it addressed an important issue, namely the extensive revisions of holocaust history over the decades. However, the performance was poor. The presenter's team was offered the change to meet with historians with sympathy for the revisionist cause and who provided a great deal of information that was excluded from the one-hour documentary. However, the presenter, David Baddiel, turned down the opportunity to meet with them. What is left is an emotive, but unconvincing and misleading account of an important episode in history. The refusal to meet with opponents itself suggests that there are doubts, still concealed, about what really happened.",False

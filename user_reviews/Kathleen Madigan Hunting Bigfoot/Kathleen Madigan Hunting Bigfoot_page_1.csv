1,9,New Original humor with some truth,ronreto,n/a,16/08/2025,"We've never heard of Kathleen Madigan but my wife and I thought we would watch the first 5 minutes of this show but we weren't expecting much. To our surprise, she immediately captured our interest and made us laugh. And she was very different from other standup comedians we have watched over the years. She not only talks about different places and situations, but also acts out different people , including family and random people she met. We liked the way she portrays each situation in a very funny way while making sense of it all. She sends a message that made us nod our heads in agreement. We highly recommend you watch this show.",False
2,9,Absolutely Hilarious,genious-35413,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love that, watching a Kathleen Madigan special, you kind of know what you're in for, but still, you are surprised and get so much more. Lots of little stories about her family are easily the highlight of this special for me. But also some great material on growing up in the Ozarks and what life is like there and also able to touch on politics without being divisive. Instead, pointing out the inanity of it all. If you're a reasonable person that isn't a die-hard cult member of either side, you can really appreciate what she's saying and find it hilarious. But stop wasting your time reading reviews like mine. Just watch the special.",False
3,9,Boxed Wine and Tiny Banjos,itgirlx,n/a,16/08/2025,"So Maddie is back and I couldn't be happier. Mama Termite (Check out Madigan's Pubcast on YouTube) is back from COVID lockdown and in fine form. She hits the high points of lowbrow observations on life in this America. She takes on the oldsters and the millennials, from the backwoods to Florida and back again keeping you laughing about it all.If you've never seen Kathleen Madigan perform her unique and side-splitting brand of comedy, you're in for a treat. Check out her other specials as well; Bothering Jesus, Madigan Again, Gone Madigan, In Others Words. They are hilarious, insightful, and worth an hour any time.",False
4,9,A real treat.,vchrgsft,n/a,16/08/2025,I have he of her but have never realized how funny she is. Very funny using situational comedy about her life and observations she makes you giggle and laugh out loud with every line delivered.On balance a very good show without ever having to stoop to sex or cruelty which is always a tell tale sight they are a class act. Big foot doesn't come around until the final gag but it's worth the wait. You won't be sorry watching this. Makes me want to find out where I can steam her other specials. Or perhaps if she was in other sit coms or films. It a pleasure to watch such a show without having to sink to the depths of gross humor.,False
5,10,Hilarious!,melissasamuels-74782,n/a,16/08/2025,"I look forward to Kathleen's podcast every week, and was so happy when her latest special came out on Prime. Her comedy is a pleasure to watch, and my bestie is convinced they could be sisters. Her genius is cultivating an aura of personable humor that makes you feel like you're having a spontaneous conversation with a friendly stranger at a local watering hole. I look forward to more jokes about her parents, weirdos from Missouri, aging politicians, and whatever else she encounters when she's on the road, reviewing the news, playing golf, searching for aliens, or hunting for bigfoot. Well done!",False
6,10,Not Millenials,currion,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like a lot of older people, Kathleen Madigan thinks every young person is a Millenial. In 2023, Millenials are between 27 and 42 years old. The young people she is describing are Gen Z. Even though I like her humor and the show was good, Kathleen has now become part of one of her own jokes. I do like her stories about some of the crackerland places she visits. If you've never been to a backa$$, redneck, small town - she does get this right. They are real. Would love to me her parents someday, they sound like they'd be a ton of fun at a cocktail party. Would love to see more comedy specials with Kathleen. As it is, I am driven to watching all her specials as repeats.",False
7,8,Longtime fan; old lady demographic,marzipanrat,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have liked her routines for years. This started a little slow, but soon I was laughing out loud. Seriously, the Bandaid joke is spot on. Her jokes on her aging parents resonate with me as someone with a purse full of pills, and I'm older than Kathleen. Yeah, she picks on groups (aging Senators, you're the butt of many jokes).Someone else here said she misnames generations. If she doesn't make you laugh, move on. That's what I do. If her jokes work for you, this is a good show with some very good material. I recommended it to several people. I'm going to watch it again. It's a bright spot in the universe.",False
8,6,"Mostly funny, but the ""millennial"" tropes are expired",lesliebobesly,n/a,16/08/2025,"Much of this special is pretty funny, but I do wish she wouldn't refer to everyone who is ditzy and younger than her as a millennial. It's kind of a cheap (and inaccurate) way to get boomer applause. Most of the people she described as millennials would actually fall into Gen Z. I'm 40 and I'm technically a millennial, so the 20-year-old space cadet millennial trope is pretty played out at this point. Time to bully the next generation, I guess?It feels like she's pandering to a particular segment of the population (baby boomers) who get off on being triggered by the word ""millennial,"" even if it's blatantly misused. And honestly, the long rants about millennials not only make her come across as an angry, out-of-touch old lady, but those (long) moments of the special feel dated and recycled from thousands of standup sets from 15 years ago.You say the country isn't ready for war, because of the entitled millennials you encounter at taco bell? News flash: half the millennials alive are too old to be drafted and all of them are older than your typical taco bell employee. Millennials are soccer moms, doctors, plumbers, professors, business owners, etc.If her set didn't rely so heavily on outdated stereotypes, I wouldn't have voted down for it. But she spends SO much time crapping on Gen Z and calling them millennials that it gets real old and pumps the brakes on the momentum of her set.",False
9,10,Loved it!,KKinDK,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had my calendar cleared for the day Hunting Bigfoot premiered. I was so excited and was not disappointed. Kathleen Madigan is one of the few comedians my very diverse family can all enjoy together and laugh instead of getting offended. Even while making jokes about millennials, she talks about them with a kind of respect that doesn't make anyone feel like they got thrown under the bus. Her perspective on current affairs are the best ( I love her podcast!), but as always, the stories about her family are my favourite. If you like stand up comedy, do yourself a favor and check out Hunting Bigfoot or any one of her specials.",False
10,10,Brilliant All The Way Through!,kamille,n/a,16/08/2025,"I gave this 10 stars without hesitation; it was THAT good! Kathleen Madigan is one of the best comedians I've ever had the good fortune to be entertained by. Most Stand-ups' spiels have their high points and low points, but Madigan's was funny from start to finish. Not just funny, but unique. She is a brilliant writer with impeccable delivery. I can't wait for her next special!Um.. I thought I was done, but apparently you cannot leave a review here unless it meets a 600 character quota. WT. .? Why? Why can't we say what we want to say in just a few lines, or a paragraph? ... 13 to go.. 3, 2, 1.",False
11,1,What a disappointment,lunapark-27573,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just another liberal using a Southern accent when she wants to make someone sound stupid, or imitate someone with a different political view than hers. Some of the jokes were funny, but you started to get the feeling that this was not a nice person as the video went on. Then she started mocking people who didn't wear masks during the pandemic. Really? We now KNOW that they did NOTHING and in fact were filthy and may have made things worse. Oh and btw, and autopsies in Europe found blue threads in the lungs of cadavers. Guess where they came from? I for one am done with the mindless Progressive, hate thumping comedians. Buh Bye Kathleen. Don't let the door hit you on the chubbiest part. (PS After a Google search about this person, who I had not known before seeing this, I found she's been one of those irrational Trump haters for years to boot! What a nut job.",False
12,8,Microphone stand issue - Funny show,J-Kidin,n/a,16/08/2025,"What the actual fuuu?! I sincerely hope whomever set up her microphone stand was immediately fired!!! Wow! This is a comedy special, not some 12:30am set at Joe's bar in Sheboygan! She tried, unsuccessfully, to fix it herself at the beginning, but she gets paid to tell jokes, not to work as a roadie. Why did no one immediately go out there to adjust the mic stand? It blocked half her face! The incompetence is unfathomable! She should be pretty POed at this BS.However, Kathleen was a trooper and went through with her show and was pretty funny. She deserved better than the ridiculous microphone set up she had. When she was younger I thought her comedy was pretty hilarious, then she went through a little phase of so so, now she's back with the funny. Her show was very enjoyable.....except for the stupid microphone stand situation that was not her fault.",False

1,8,Great doc for what it is,jawhoney,n/a,15/08/2025,And what it is is a documentary about theatre souvenir/ memorabilia collectors (don't wanna say hoarders even tho I do because they're organized in the collecting and it's for a specific passion). I can understand the love for theatre it's sad knowing these people are trying to have a piece of theatre that they weren't able to pursue themselves.,False
2,6,"Jesus. I love musicals more then I love people but oh god, am I this sad?",pjreilly-423-417061,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerEvery person in this documentary depressed me.Especially, the German woman who loves Starlight Express. Omg. She constantly talks about how she's not happy and wants to kill herself.I saw Company (2008) nine times. Jesus, am I this?",True
3,10,A rare insight into the human condition,LoveMoophies,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't know where to start with this film. I went on such an emotional rollercoaster. I started off laughing at these extreme fans, but ending up questioning why I am not more like them! Be warned though, this film is not all jazz hands and tap dancing, it is an exploration into all aspects of musical theatre fandom, and the compulsions some people have in attaching themselves to a hobby. Both sides of the fandom are shown, which is quite confronting to watch, but necessary to show what happens when boundaries are crossed. It should be noted how many great female characters are in this film, who speak with such raw and vulnerable honesty, which takes immense trust and skill. This director shows great promise, if this is what he delivers for his first feature film.",False
4,10,Really resonated with this theatre fan!,raypalmerII,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw a trailer for this a few weeks back and had to watch...OMG I saw so much of me in this film! It is a love letter to all of us that love musical theatre. Right now, with theatres closed I found it especially poignant - and it really reminded me just how precious live theatre is. Rather than making fun of people taking part, it offers a real insight into what makes them (and us) tick. It made me cry a few times but it's funny too. Watch it if you've ever seen and fallen in love with a show.",False
5,10,A Star Is Born,TonyOscarEmmy,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is unfathomable that this is the Director's first doco.
Repeat Attenders has been meticulously crafted with such attention to detail, that makes the film unforgettable.
This documentary takes the viewer on a journey of the psyche of the Super Fan- what makes these fans see a show again and again?
It is clear that the the director Mark Dooley, has the passion, empathy and unique ability to get to the heart of the Repeat Attender's story. He has shades of Louis theroux. I cannot wait to see what this Star film maker does next. A must see for ALL lovers of musical theatre.",False
6,1,"An exploitative, sad mess",byronbache-,n/a,15/08/2025,"There's a point about an hour into Repeat Attenders where the director decides to derail his own moderately competent documentary by platforming a man who repeatedly threatened to rape Debbie Gibson.Almost all the subjects interviewed are being exploited for their mental illness, and the film is obviously pieced together from footage that was shot across an entire decade.The whole thing is sad, joyless and unexpectedly dark. It's occasionally fascinating, but the extended interview with Debbie Gibson's stalker makes the film not worth anyone's time or money.There's a great film to be made about Broadway fan culture and the people who sleep out for rush tickets, but this absolutely isn't it.",False
7,10,Can you see the same musical too many times?,adamkrafferty,n/a,15/08/2025,"That seems to be question documentarian Mark Dooley is posing in this skilled first feature. In his considerately balanced investigation he certainly finds superfans that would support the argument that fanaticism can turn to unhealthy obsession. Yet along the way he also uncovers that the love of sitting in a darkened auditorium absorbing musical theatre goodness, can not only allow us to find a world that feels like home, but one that brings those of like minds together in a wonderful way, no matter how many times they may have seen a show.
From Broadway, to the West End, Australia and Germany, this fascinating documentary covers the globe and the gamut of musical theatre goodness and ends on a feel good note of discovery that's an absolute delight. I've already repeat attended Repeat Attenders and can't recommend it more highly, especially to music theatre lovers.",False
8,5,Dim Lights on Broadway,emcd23,n/a,15/08/2025,"I did not like this film at all.
Being fond of musical theatre I found the film depressing and in parts creepy.
It's not a side of the genre I am comfortable with.
Also , it did seem like a sponsored promotion for the German production of Starlight Express.
The quality of filming and content was inconsistent with some of the shows included clearly not giving consent for inclusion.",False
9,9,Theatre Geeks Rejoice!!,nsneddon-35144,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was transfixed from the start- but wasn't prepared for my own roller coaster of emotions. I won't spoil it, but for anyone who has ever felt pure elation and excitement at that red velvet curtain rising, then this is an absolute must see. I'm excited to see what this director does next. Encore!!",False

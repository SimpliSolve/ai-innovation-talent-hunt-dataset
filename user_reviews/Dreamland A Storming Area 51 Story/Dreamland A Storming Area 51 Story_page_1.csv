1,1,Go Watch Paint Dry - It Will Be 1000% More Entertaining,adrian-m-miller,n/a,16/08/2025,"Trust me when i tell you that EVERY ""review"" of this that gives it more than a 1 and promsies humour is lying to you. I feel cheated that i have to write enough words to satisfy the requirements to warn you, this movie is a thief in every way.Theres no redeeming features, no humour, and literally everyone in it should never appear in a movie, tv show, documentary, and if i had my way, just life in general, ever again.Apparently the main guy is a comedian...hmm...there must be a very different definition thatn what we call comedy in Australia.I have genuine sympathy for any who was stupid enough to hand these people money to make this appalling drivel.",False
2,1,SHAKY CAMERA TO BEGIN WITH,carlitosnavas,n/a,16/08/2025,"The introduction was nice, so as soon as I was getting comfortable the real thing started just to have a horrible shaky camera, just a few seconds it started I had to stop it or otherwise get a headache for the day, so, I have to say that this think is unwatchable, amateurish camera movements. The introduction was nice, so as soon as I was getting comfortable the real thing started just to have a horrible shaky camera, just a few seconds it started I had to stop it or otherwise get a headache for the day, so, I have to say that this think is unwatchable, amateurish camera movements. I don't understand either why to require a minimum characters.",False
3,10,This was a hilariously honest documentary,radionbusiness,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved the parts where we got to see the struggle in making this film and then seeing what it turned out to become. A lot of people seem to be pretty hard on this film but I did not think it was that bad considering it started out with the main guy having a mental breakdown and talking about how the film is the break it or make it in his life. I personally found this film really interesting for that part alone because a lot of other films would not show that at the end of production and us normal people would just see what we think is a normal everyday life of a film maker, but there's struggles in everyday life. Anyways this had to be 600 charecters so I kept typing without thinking. Lol.10/10 just for keeping it real. I almost felt like I was on the trip with you guys.",False
4,6,What did you expect? Don't be so hard on this doc,comblitz,n/a,16/08/2025,"A few things to note off the bat:1) Why are all the 10 star reviews by people who only have 1 review. This is always upsetting to me and I lose respect for the production team that does this.2) The most interesting person in this film is Natasha and they didn't feature her enough. She seems like a whack job who was hanging out in the desert but if you find her on IMDB, you'll see she has been in quite a few projects (unlike most everyone else).3) Brian Moreno is great. He made me get behind his struggle from the get go. He was constantly battling potential mutinies.He's nervous, he's anxious and when his expectations were demolished, he self-destructed until saved by a few interviews.At this time, this has a 3.1 rating. I don't believe that's fair. But I suppose the 1 star ratings offset the BS 10 star ratings, so whatever.I finished this feature and by the end, I was happy to have seen it. It was an interesting journey and I enjoyed seeing all the characters except the pony tail white shirt guy who I found incredibly boring. As for Andy and Brian, it was great to see their attitudes take a 180 by the end, and seemed like they had no regrets.I've never been to that part of Nevada so it was fun to see what it was like, or the absence of anything interesting out there.Take this movie for what it is worth... Brian's struggle to document something that never got off the ground. I hope he makes more with much of the same people.",False
5,10,Funny & Exciting,lisamauro-70739,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wild ride to Area 51 with a funny group of comedians looking for answers that we may never have, but might as well believe the unbelievable, or make a fun adventure out of it! Do you aliens exist?Entertaining for sure! Read a little bit about the background in High Times, saw it from a different point of view the second time around- check out that article. Kinda cool how the crew actually bonds together knowing what they went through- getting down to the nitty gritty.Feeling like a laugh and light night, watch this movie, you won't see anything else just like it, enjoy the film- can't miss it!",False
6,10,If you like both comedy and documentaries - this film is for you!!,katelinchristenson,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThough I do find things like aliens and Area 51 interesting, I sometimes get bored with ""documentaries"" related to such. However, this one was really funny and entertaining the whole way through. I like the funny banter between the friend group and Ioved all the interviews of the other random people who were really into the E. T. stuff. I feel like even people who are skeptical of these kinds of things would still enjoy it because it was lighthearted, funny, and not too serious - or that's how I interpreted it. The editing was really good, too. It was funny hearing some personal details of the ""characters"" like how the main guy put his fiance on the back burner so he could pursue this exploration dream of his. Would have even liked to hear more of everyones background and what all lead them to this journey - even if it was all a joke anyway.",True
7,9,My kind of movie,Arumovie,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe movie was hilarious. The whole storming of area 51 is super interesting to me and this was a great take on it. Bought it and will watch it again because they were a lot of funny one liners that I'm sure I missed and/or forgot. It was kinda weird that Harvey Weinstein was in the movie but that's ok :) He was awesome and I'm hoping I can catch one of his stand up shows. I believe this is Brian Moreno's first movie and I thought it was wonderfully put together.Natasha Pearl Hansen and Andy Kozel are in the move. Both hilarious comics who are extremely funny in this movie. Can't believe somebody didn't grab Andy's bag at the airport??,True
8,10,what a fun film,bs0021,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not into aliens or area 51 but this was fun ride. I don't know what I expected bc I saw some mean review from a ""critic"" lol. This was gritty, and it made me smile. I don't know if I've ever seen a doc like this. I haven't seen a comedy documentary in a long time, I hope this inspires more people to make unique things. This movie definitely had it's own vibe, at times it reminded me of The Office and other times it remined me of Best in Show. If you like that kinda stuff you'll like this. I came here to look up the cast and crew just to see if it was a real doc, I still can't tell. I guess that was point. Good work all.",False
9,10,Aliens exist,himynameissherrie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seeing how everything unfolds in this documentary is so fascinating. I was immediately interested when storming Area 51 was playing out in real time on social media / the news because it was such a wild idea. I didn't really know what to expect going in to watching but it was fantastic. The documentary was really well done and informative as well as funny. I think everyone involved brought it together to make it great. I'll be recommending it to my friends and family, even the skeptics. This isn't the type of film you watch once and forget about. Watching it a couple times you notice things in the material and background you don't catch the first time. I hope Tom Delonge enjoys it as much as I did.",False
10,10,It's silly and funny.,pauloblob,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was almost feeling bad about Brian Moreno when the movie was 10mins in.Took me a while to understand what the movie was really about.Natasha was great and gave the film a fresh humor.By the end, I loved how all the characters were relieved and wondering if they would ever trust Brian again.Love the realistic side of the Alien Fire Festival.A bunch of relatable losers will make you laugh.Such a fun movie!! What else from a cast of comedians? A documentary on their adventure to Area 51- but get the real scoop on how the crew/cast bonds and see it, you know if you know!I recommend. Have fun watching.",False

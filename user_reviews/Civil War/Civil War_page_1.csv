1,9,More Than I Thought It Would Be,Hitchcoc,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was ready for a rather biased indictment of the South and slavery. But the filmmakers really bent over backward to be as balanced as they could. Remember that the northern states and many of our founding fathers held slaves. The sad thing is that many in the South continue to say it's all in the past; it's history: so leave it alone. Yes, according to law, slavery no longer exists. Then we have the same expressions of hatred. I was particularly impressed with the kids in this documentary who were very forthcoming in their views on both sides of the issue.",False
2,9,For the South the War Defiantly Drags On,blpkst,n/a,15/08/2025,"An intriguing documentary on MSNBC that deals with the affect the Civil War has played in forming peoples' opinion about how we think about country, ourselves and race. The American south has a very complicated and complex idea about a war they lost. Usually the victors get to shape the narrative, in this case it is the south who lost the war but ""won"" keeping an emancipated group of the population down. The Confederate flag is very much a part of who many of the south still want to be. This documentary surprised me at how deep it is willing to go to let people have their say. As a northerner, it is difficult to understand why anyone would be proud of a confederate flag, a symbol of oppression and want to have their state identified with it, still? That flag is so clearly a mark of ignorance, defiance and hate. By contrast and comparison the only Germans, identified with a Nazi swastika, are considered to be ignorant thugs in their own country. A symbol of shame that Germany has dedicated itself to educate every generation to know and understand their shameful history. Back in America, five states still use elements of the ""stars and bars"" portions of the Confederate battle flag, but Mississippi is the only state still incorporating the entire battle emblem into its state flag.",False
3,7,Good intentions but unfocused,supercygnus,n/a,15/08/2025,This would have benefited from a more narrow scope because the subject matter is massive and complicated. It bounces around and scratches surfaces but ultimately seems to almost be saying that we'll never be able to change minds. I don't think that was the intention. The interviewer seems to lead or set ip answers a bit too often as well. But still there are powerful and occasionally truly disturbing moments that will leave you thinking and hopefully talking.,False
4,10,"Amazing, artful exploration of contemporary impact of slavery/Civil War",cyarborough-16092,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film powerfully explores the contemporary impact of how slavery and the Civil War are and are not taught and understood throughout our country. Faulkner said, ""The past is never dead. It is not even past."" This film serves as a vivid illustration of that truth.Do yourself a favor...watch it and think.",False
5,10,Incredible,luicruz,n/a,15/08/2025,Amazing pls watch. This is the honest truth about America. We have been so proned to believe the propaganda that was thrown at us for decades.,False
6,10,Amazing Perspective On Kids and How This Isn't An Easy Topic,cnlopez-76074,n/a,15/08/2025,The main take away for me was how divided we are as a country in the Deep South. It's still as though the south has not changed from over 120 yrs ago. The Whites still have a need to make sure they are in control of the entire storyline and how white dominated states are going to be this way for many more years.,False
7,10,Brilliant,bk2488,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dr. Carr's class at Howard University was the highlight of this thorough historical journey through the pedagogy of the civil war in the American education system, from Black schools to White schools, from high schools to universities. Required viewing for all good citizens.",False
8,9,"The ""Lost Cause"" Narrative",twelve-house-books,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary discusses in a wide variety of ways the ""Lost Cause"" Narrative, one in which, as a child born and raised in the Deep South, I was taught as the truth and propagated myself through jokes, slurs, and mistruths about Blacks, the South, slavery, etc. Essentially, the narrative in question teaches through repetition that the Civil War was not about slavery but States' rights (to secede), but would any State have seceded if their institution of slavery had not been threatened? Of course not. Why would you intentionally embargo yourself if you didn't feel that your entire world philosophy had dangerous opponents? After all, it was well known that Abraham Lincoln was a Melungeon--Black, Indian, and Portuguese--and the States seceded because they could see that he would become President and oppose their revered institution. Slavery had to be stopped, and it is unfortunate that violent means had to be employed, but it is maybe more unfortunate that in the case of the Civil War the losers have written--or rewritten--history in order to maintain their sense of superiority over another human ethnicity considered to be somehow inferior to those with light or ""white"" skin. Gone With The Wind. And good riddance. Help kill the Lost Cause narrative.",True
9,2,It was oretty decent,tqvdrczb,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didnt like that biracial kid that sounded like he had his father's talking points. He kepttalking about how asian Americans life was so much harder than black peoole but they weren't blaming the system. You cant have system that operated for the better part of four centuries and expect people to be iver it in One generation. Therecare people alive today who know what Jim Crow was like. Ruby Bridges experienced that first hand and is still alive today so to expect black people to just get over it when the construct still exist today albeit now so visble, nonetheless still exists.",False

1,7,She's funny even if you're not a Grandma!,JayDeadieEagle,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this stand up special, for Leanne's ability to be honest, self-deprocating, and fun while keeping it modest enough that you don't have to cringe at it!I reccognize I am definitley not the demographic for this comedy special seen as though I'm 22 and male. But that doesn't detract from the jokes being funny! It reminds me of the older folks in my life, and while I can't relate to anything that was talked about, It's really nice to hear someone else being able to laugh at themselves.This stand up is a great reminder that we are all human. We collectively are more alike then different and even people from wildly different walks of life to you, still have their own challenges and struggles to work through. Great job seeing the positives in things!",False
2,7,"""Everybody I know is on a CPAP machine.""",classicsoncall,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's rare to find a comedian performance on Netflix that doesn't devolve into obscenity, so in that respect, Leanne Morgan was a refreshing change. Like Jerry Seinfeld, she works 'clean', and she can be funny doing it. She called this performance part of her 'Big Panty Tour' though that's not mentioned in the promo for this special. With only a quick mention of that, Morgan goes on to describe elements of her family life, with particular attention to her overachiever husband - ""I love him, I just don't want to be with him.""
It's all in good fun, as she laments how she gained weight during Covid via Jello salads, while taking swipes against perimenopause and fighting over the thermostat with Hubby Chuck. Her delivery is a bit static, but punctuated with facial expressions and body language that adds some life to the presentation. Her routine may not be laugh out loud funny, but she did get a handful of chuckles out of this viewer, and for that, I'd probably catch a few more of her shows.",True
3,10,She absolutely NAILED it!,Randall-223-854497,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had so much fun watching this. Maybe it was because I am dead in the middle of her demographic, but I was in stitches throughout her whole delivery. I can't wait to sit down with my wife and watch it again. We have been there, done that. Leanne has the uncanny ability to verbalize the 50 YO+'s mind in a family-friendly way that is downright hilarious.I thought the pace of the jokes was ideal, and her delivery flawless. Like my wife often tells me... It's not necessarily what you are saying that is funny, the way you tell it that is funny. She has this down in spades.If you want to see how humor can be done without the F-Bomb, then you will love this!",False
4,10,No Pu$$y Jokes take note female comedians,MrMovieReviewer,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cannot express how refreshing this was to watch, I mean when I first saw it I thought what the hell I'll give it a try, Because my tolerance for female comedians isn't great, As it seems all they have is Pu$$y jokes and sex jokes, it was so refreshing to see a witty funny comedian that didn't resort to Pu$$y jokes, in fact it was rather family friendly, and I actually enjoyed watching this in fact it's one of only a few specials I have rewatched a few times, There's something warm and loving about this I really hope to see more Netflix specials from this breath of fresh air in the female comedian genre.",False
5,10,She makes us laugh about life!,jsnow57,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have watched many clips of Leanne Morgan but this is the first feature event and it was super! I like her type of humor, probably in part because I am a southern woman and just a little bit older than her. By including her family in her routine, it is easy to relate as a wife and a mom ( and those younger college days:)). She told funny stories that you could share with old and young alike and not worried about the language or if they needed to be ""bleeped"". I believe what you see is exactly what you get with Ms Morgan, she is a woman, a wife and a mother that does a wonderful job sharing her humorous life stories in a way that makes you feel like a part of her family for a little while. Great show!",False
6,3,Senior Discount Comedy Special,gmdr-86774,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're a middle class housewife white woman from the Bible Belt or Midwest that also peaked in the 80s, you'll probably love her. It's incredibly ironic for a special titled ""I'm Every Woman"", my wife and I could neither relate to her on any level. She clearly has a devoted fan base (to my surprise) that has shown up in these reviews to support her. And good for her, because everyone has to make a living somehow.We watch nearly every standup special available on Netflix, but this one felt like an absolute chore to reach the 25 minute mark where we mutually called it quits. Jokes were painfully predictable middle age topics, yet lack any attempt at misdirection that someone like Anthony Jeselnik is so talented with.I've no doubt there's a low bar audience for this content, but in a world of abundant choice, this wasn't worth wasting the remaining time on the clock for us. So I'll recommend it to my 60 year old aunts because I suspect they may also adore it.",False
7,10,Charmingly Hilarious,pmer,n/a,16/08/2025,"A natural comedian and beautifully observed comedy.I have followed Leanne Morgan on Facebook and Instagram for years and have loved her delivery and belly laughs so much, I even emailed Reid Hastings of Netflix a couple of years ago, begging for a special like this. I'm ""tickled"" (a Morgan-ism) that Leanne had finally found the larger audience she deserves.Her comedy is so self-effacing, natural and good humoured (no snark or divisiveness), which straddles every demographic with love and kisses on the mouth (another Morgan-ism).This special is a true testament to the power of dedicated hard work over decades, and the rewards it can do richly bestow on those who truly deserve it. An excellent and hilarious comedy special by Leanne Morgan. God bless.",False
8,2,A comedy special without comedy...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had never heard about Leanne Morgan prior to stumbling upon this 2023 Netflix comedy special. But I figured I would sit down and check out the show. Perhaps I was missing out on a grand comedy star here.Turns out that I wasn't. Leanne Morgan didn't manage to bring me to laughter once throughout the course of the 74 minutes that this comedy special ran for. And that made sitting through it quite the ordeal. I think she managed to bring me to a single smile once, and that was about it. Her comedy just utterly failed to tickle me in any of the right places, and her energy level on the stage was equal to the energy level of a can of unopened paint.If I have to find something positive to say about ""Leanne Morgan: I'm Every Woman"", then it was the fact that her material wasn't immature and below the belt, which is often seen in stand-up comedy. Nor was it comedy at the expense of others, aside from her husband.Her on-stage performance was just lackluster. She had no energy and no aura. She simply stood there and talked in a very monotonous tone of voice. It was like watching a marionette puppet on the stage.Now, I am sure that fans of hers will enjoy this 2023 comedy special, no doubt about it. I, however, wasn't the least bit entertained by this comedy special.My rating of ""Leanne Morgan: I'm Every Woman"" lands on a generous two out of ten stars.",False
9,10,I really enjoyed this,mls4182,n/a,16/08/2025,"This lady knows what she is doing. She is hilarious yet INNOFENSIVE! Pretty hard to believe.She is mostly self effacing and isn't out to offend any type of person or group. She makes fun of life in general and herself. Unlike most modern comedians, she isn't mean spirited, political, or trying to get cheap laughs off of promoting stereotypes.I really can't imagine even the touchiest person getting offended by this show and at the same time I can't imagine anyone not getting a lot of laughs from it.The nation needs this kind of pleasant spirited commentary. She is a very likeable and hilarious soul. I highly recommend.",False
10,9,Refreshing and Clean,cockezville,n/a,16/08/2025,"That awful pandemic gave me an opportunity to check out some new comics on streaming and I found her. I just loved her snippets on You tube and her upbeat, family friendly with some innuendo approach as well as her non standup check ins with her fans. I found myself laughing out loud at her southern observational and confessional humor
This special of new material does not disappoint, as it tackles life on the road, her family, life as empty nestors and her life in a southern town. Just funny stuff. Her timing is impeccable as usual and she is just so likable that you come away feeling you have just made a new friend.So glad that she is not a blue comic, as that would ruin her persona. She throws in healthy innuendo and her facial expressions tell it all.",False
11,10,Laughed out loud,mrocco-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"In this politically charged year of 2024, I've turned to comedy as a way to unwind and escape. If a comedian's style doesn't resonate with me, I simply move on-I don't see the point in leaving negative reviews for something that's just not my taste. While some comedians manage to keep me entertained and smiling, it's rare for me to laugh out loud unless I'm at a live show.I had never heard of Leanne before, but after watching Joe Rogan's recent Netflix special, her show popped up as a recommendation, so I gave it a try. Even though I'm in her age demographic, I don't share many of her life experiences-I don't have kids, I'm not struggling with weight and I don't have a husband wanting to do it at the most inopportune times. That said, I found her absolutely hysterical! There were plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, and I'd definitely pay to see her live-I'm confident I'd laugh even harder in person.",False
12,4,Funny,seraichyk,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm around her age, and found most of her material very relatable and funny. The stuff about her husband, their relationship, what it's like being in our 50's, her thoughts on her body, etc...all very funny.I was taken aback by her saying her parents owned a ""mink processing plant"". This is information that could be kept out of a standup routine.If her parents killed dogs for a living, would she have mentioned it? The fact that she mentioned it, to me revealed that she's got no moral issue with it. So... I immediately lost any affection that I'd collected for her up to that point. Hard to enjoy someone I think so little of.",False
13,10,Deliciously hilarious!,janzie4438,n/a,16/08/2025,"Leanne feels like a friend who is clever and a delight to spend time with! Her humor is refreshingly unique! It is so nice that she only says one cuss word, all the way through. I can relate to her stories about her kids! I recently saw her in Knoxville and it was worth every penny; I laughed until I cried and I highly suggest wearing a panty liner when watching her! Leanne recently announced that she will be in an upcoming movie playing Reese Witherspoon's older sister! I cannot wait to see it! So happy to see her rise to fame after 22 years of being in comedy! Check out her Netflix special! I'm a fan for life!",False
14,9,"Hillarious, a must see",nwauntie,n/a,16/08/2025,"A must see. Luckily, I found LeeAnn Morgan comedy during covid while looking for videos on YouTube and have seen most of her sets through her years as a comic. What is nice about her is that her sets are not repeats of her previous material, always new insights. Her take on everyday things have hillarious twists and turns, you actually feel you are right there experiencing what she is talking about. Many times I almost peed myself from laughing so hard. This show was an easy hour long and I wanted more! I absolutely love her and I suspect you will too, laughter is so needed with all the troubles in our world. So glad Netflix finally gave her a special and I look forward to many more.",False
15,10,Amazingly funny,nikki-21436,n/a,16/08/2025,I've been a fan for years and soooo glad she got the special she deserved. I thought the whole special was relatable and hilarious. I'm only 32 and I swear she was speaking to me lol. She talks like every real woman without brining in politics or being crude and offensive and it's refreshing. I have watched this twice already Bc made my husband watch the second time and he's a harsh critic and even he was busting up laughing. I hope to see her so another special but if not I will still follow her on her tours and social media as her and her children are a joy to watch. She's getting all the recognition she deserves.,False
16,10,Down to Earth Appealing to All: Got Lots of Laughs,simonebow-52576,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am about ten years older than Leanne, single, no children, an urban West coast intellectual and I found Leanne's comedy relatable and hilarious. She is humble and somehow manages to hone in on universal insecurities especially of the cisgender feminine variety. The 74 minutes flew by. Enormously appealing and entertaining. As others have pointed out her comedy is gentle and inoffensive. Looking forward to her next special. It is a treat listening to her musical Tennessee twang. Her appearance is also quite refreshing- not super-dolled or glammed up - reminds me of someone I used to know - Leanne is an ordinary and brilliant woman.",False
17,10,She's the whole package!,MyMovieTVRomance,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh my gosh!! I am only 28 minutes into this, and it's already one of the best stand-up comedy specials I've ever seen!!It feels wholesome, it feels real, it feels cozy, it feels safe, and yet, it feels relatable and so much fun!! This makes me feel like I'm a kid again, because these are the kind of women that I remember on TV growing up. She reminds me of a new Brett Butler!Leanne Morgan is really not the kind of woman we see much these days, but we used to see quite often, way back when. And I miss people like her in the public sphere. I honestly thought they didn't exist anymore!She feels all at once like a blast from the past and like a breath of fresh air!I love it, love it, love it- and love her! And if I may be a little bit more of a TV geek right now, I will say that she looks like the voice of Betty Rubble of ""The Flintstones""- Bea Benaderet!Old-school beauty coupled with old-school charm, plus she made me laugh myself, silly!! Leanne Morgan is the whole package! A+ plus plus!!",False

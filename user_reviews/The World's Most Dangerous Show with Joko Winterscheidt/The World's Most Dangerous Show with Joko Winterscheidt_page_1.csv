1,10,I did not expect that,paderborn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started the series because I felt the need for shallow entertainment in typical Joko manner. After 5 minutes then the blatant plot twist. This series is an extremely successful and entertaining documentary about various global interdependencies, which are not least the cause of climate change. As someone who is interested in climate change, you won't find much new here, but you will be happy about the very good production, the interviews and encounters with inspiring people.For the majority, I would say that the right balance is struck here between knowledge, pointing fingers and entertainment. I hope and wish that this good combo will reach a wide audience.Seriously. Thank you Joko! It's obvious that this is an important topic for you and that you put a lot of energy into it. But what has been achieved behind the scenes is even greater!",False
2,10,"I started thinking before, but....",birkel-36999,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started thinking before, but the series Show us the the dark reality and ways to make it better for the future. We can not change everything right now, but each of us can leave a small green fringerprint on the Planet. And maybe the future is a little bit more green. The Industry don't want change Things, just we as the costumers can change the Industry! Watch the Show and think about it seriously! ðŸ¤˜
At the end, everyone of us is a pice of the Image, right now it is more dark, but if we really wanna change our thinking, the Image could be colorful and full of life!We are the future, we are the beginning of what comes next!",False
3,10,"About, beyond and between the Problems...",skyjumpingjackson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not everything, or probably nothing is new, of course, and episode 3 is maybe a little to vague and imprecise, but the way Joko and the grew walk you through the climate issues and also the connected personal doubts and problems and also the way the industry fakes the stuff is a new level of reflecting it. It is hopefully just the beginning of a more deeper analysis where we will see hopefully in a next step of him more action builded on the starting point of this series. On the one hand it doesn't feel like it will change anything because the problems where already thousand times said, but on the other hand I hope and believe that this guy is really interested in doing or changing something within this way and mabye its just the beginning like he says, whats his purpose after doing a lot of crazy stuff already in the planet. He shows the balls to reflect the situations, circumstances and also hinself and is honestly trying and not giving up to dive deeper and deeper to get to the point of bring up a potential solution, or finding a starting point for action. In a nutshell, it spreads creativity, authenticity, gives hope for more into the good and maybe chatches a new audiance as well.",False
4,1,"This is not a documentary - this is populism, one-sided and not well-founded!",j-loeffler-33368,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile episodes 1 and 2 can perhaps still be dismissed as entertaining entertainment (but not as well-founded documentation on the subject of the climate crisis), episode 3 is simply populist opinion-making that presents facts in an undifferentiated and one-sided manner. It will not contribute to a solution, but in my opinion, in the worst case, will (further) divide our society in view of the challenge of the climate crisis.Examples (warning ""spoilers""):
While in episodes 1 and 2 innovation and technology are shown as possible solutions, in episode 3 the industry is completely demonized - what a contradiction. Where should innovation come from if not from (industrial) companies?It is certainly correct if, in retrospect, the actions of some companies are critically assessed (e.g. VW and the exhaust gas scandal). Some companies are criticized for actions from 30-40 years ago, but it is forgotten that other people are of course at the helm today. Who of us individuals was interested in climate change 20 years ago?Furthermore, the newer developments are completely hidden (e.g. RWE also offers solutions for renewable energies, VW offers electric cars). In addition, VW is criticized for selling SUVs instead of focusing on the buyers of such cars.A particular madness is that the actions of an individual are denied the meaning (in the sense: you don't need to change, it doesn't make a difference anyhow) only to then suggest that you as an individual can sue the ""bad"" companies and states.Honestly, is that supposed to be the solution?Companies are not artificial structures, but are also managed by people. This climate crisis affects everyone and in my opinion everyone has to contribute to the solution. However, there is not the one right solution here, so we can/must have a controversial discussion about the way. Basically, however, it only works hand in hand as a society.This show does not bring any benefit to the challenges of climate crisis that lay ahead of us.",True

6,1,science versus feelings,hardtobuff,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a pity that this alleged documentation has nothing to do with science. If you check the facts, nothing is correct.The fact that Joko Winterscheidt is getting involved in such a project that is hardly based on actual facts makes me think.I get the impression that feelings are more important than science.",False

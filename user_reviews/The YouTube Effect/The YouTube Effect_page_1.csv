1,7,Concentrated/Focused,tdwillis-26273,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was a decent documentary but missed opportunities.A pretty concentrated and focused film! Perhaps more suited for those just beginning to become aware of social media issues. It's definitely a step in the right direction.I'd be interested in other areas of concern besides the more obvious ones stated in this documentary.I.e. Digital addiction, effects on cognitive,social,mental etc on children who are now being inundated with constant digital input.I do have to say, I was leaning more towards the concept of freedom of speech and taking personal responsibility in what a person allows for themselves and their families (I still believe that) but this documentary has me pondering if it won't take more then that. Not sure. Will continue to ponder
In the end, I suppose thats what a decent documentary should do.",False
2,3,The documentary effect,darkshad3,n/a,16/08/2025,"While this documentary has good points, it was immediately clear that it does the same as all other documentaries. I watched it fully, to the end, to see if they would flip things around in the second half to show all points of view. But no. They bring up the same people, the same opinions. All one-sided. Yep, sure, I agree that extremism is bad. Right-wing extremism is bad. But why don't they ever mention left wing extremism? As if they aren't present on social media platforms? As if they don't radicalize people? It shows the lack of creativity, honesty, and good faith of the producers. Taking the same old tired approach ""that group"" of people are bad and are the cause of all bad things. Fifteen minutes into the documentary this was very clear and it disappointed all the way through. They threw Thunderf00t onto a background wall of ""right-wing"" video producers. A lot of things go to show the lack of knowledge and the lack of research. They were just going by what the (same old) people they reached out to told them and taking their word for it. Due to lack of experience, laziness, political bias, malice or a mix of all of those, you're getting a boring and predictable cookie cutter left wing documentary. Funny thing is that they interview someone who uses the handle ""contrapoints"". The hint was right there people. CONTRA points. Do some of your own research. Get in an opposing opinion. If you want an honest documentary about social media, this isn't it.",False
3,1,Doesn't say anything we don't already know,SleepyMaya,n/a,16/08/2025,"I expected some interesting cover of YouTube's history through the years, but instead the whole movie just states the obvious (literally starts by telling you how the internet itself didn't always exist, wow really?) and quickly turns into just being about how YouTube has an algorithm that picks videos to recommend to you and that is affecting what you might watch, and there is a reason why some things might get recommended to you more than others, and the reason is (get ready to be shocked) that they want you to stay on the website for as long as possible, and of course some people can abuse the algorithm to make it recommend specific things to you. From that moment on, that algorithm is pretty much the only thing they talk about for the rest of the movie. This maybe would be interesting if the movie was made 10 years ago, but by now I think we are all pretty much aware of that already, considering it's been talked about everywhere for years. It could at least reveal new information or interesting facts about the topic to make it fresh, but really it didn't, it just repeated the same old things we all already know. There are barely maybe 4 YouTubers interviewed on this so called documentary about YouTube, two of them were from the same channel, the other two I've never even heard of.The movie also seem to push some political agenda to you, which while honestly it wasn't an agenda that I disagree with, it did make me feel like I was watching a political movie pretending to be a movie about YouTube and I didn't appreciate that.None of the information in the movie is wrong, but considering it really doesn't say anything we don't already know, plus feeling like the whole documentary was just an excuse to shove some political message into our face (regardless of what that message is), I sadly couldn't help but feel like I've wasted my time watching it and that's why I gave it the low score.",False
4,2,Another disappointment,melievox,n/a,16/08/2025,"I should have known better, but I was really hoping (once again) for an informative, unbiased, documentary relating to social media. Unfortunately, this did not deliver.I will say that some of the content in this documentary was informative and interesting, however it was not very far into this documentary when it became clear to me that it was yet another biased documentary I wasted money on.Allow me to sum it up for you. This documentary is half providing you with general inside information and half talking about how the extreme ""right-wing"" used YouTube to indoctrinate people and spread conspiracy theories.I was REALLY hoping that because they made it a point to mention the ""alt-right"" so much, that they would, at some point, mention the ""alt-left"", because being unbiased includes showing both sides, especially as it relates to this documentary. However, they did not. Has the alt-left not capitalized on YouTube and used it in the same way as the alt-right!?!? Of course they have. Just say it. It's a fact. So mention both, or focus on neither.Maybe you'll like this. Maybe you won't. But I can tell you that if you're looking for an unbiased, informative documentary with absolutely no agenda whatsoever, this isn't it.",False
5,8,Fast paced informative documentary.,tronvszombies-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wasn't really sure what this was going to be. Having watched it. It charts the history of YouTube from its formation to global money making behemoth. It points out a lot of the problems created by free speech/click chasing content. Some good, some bad. I'm a fan of YouTube and my algorithms are mainly game and film. I've even had to go to a YouTube content creator gig with my kid. Fever pitch! Saying that I know from my friend group some would enjoy this while others would be have trouble accepting what is an on the level documentary. It is a good show for teenagers who would benefit from getting a handle on the ideas presented in an entertaining way. It also packs a lot in. I remember the Momo stuff. The local primary school had to email parents to tell them of the dangers! I hate the word triggering but some will instantly shut off what is a decent documentary on a timely subject.",False
6,n/a,Lost in the YouTube Maze,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe YouTube Effect, while aiming to explore the platform's influence, ultimately gets lost in its own maze. It jumps from topic to topic - extremism, misinformation, mental health - without a clear thread, leaving viewers feeling disoriented. The documentary's focus on the negative overshadows the positive, creating an unbalanced and ultimately underwhelming experience.Furthermore, the film relies heavily on sensationalism, showcasing extreme cases of online radicalization and harassment. This approach, while attention-grabbing, ultimately undermines the film's credibility and fails to offer a nuanced understanding of the challenges at hand. The YouTube Effect leaves viewers with a sense of unease and a dearth of meaningful solutions, ultimately failing to provide a balanced and informative look at the complexities of YouTube's impact on society.",True
7,1,Big disappointment,ianislavus-322-111398,n/a,16/08/2025,"The YouTube Effect starts off promising, exploring the platform's immense influence on modern society. However, it quickly devolves into a disappointingly one-sided narrative. The film pushes the tired trope of leftist voices as noble victims while painting anything remotely right-leaning as dangerous or problematic. The underlying message? More censorship is necessary-because, apparently, people can't be trusted to think for themselves.Rather than a balanced examination of YouTube's role in shaping discourse, the documentary feels more like a sermon on why the platform should suppress certain viewpoints. It conveniently ignores how mainstream media and corporations manipulate the algorithm to serve their own interests while blaming independent creators for all of society's ills.If you're looking for a critical and nuanced take on YouTube's impact, this isn't it. Instead, it's a predictable echo chamber that tells you what to think rather than presenting facts and letting you decide. Save your time.",False

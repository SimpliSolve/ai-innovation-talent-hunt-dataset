1,7,Too real too human,valadas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes there is no story or plot. We see a succesful series of scenes and images portraying the lives of ordinary people (no actors or actresses performing). We watch normal Portuguese citizens either from the country or urban surroundings, black and white, gypsies and foreigners,eating, playing music and dancing, riding horses, taking care of children and pets and one even training a falcon all in a very realistic way. This is more a documentary than a fiction movie.",False

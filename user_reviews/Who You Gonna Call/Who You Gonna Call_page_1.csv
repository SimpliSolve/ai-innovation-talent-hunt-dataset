3,10,Admirer before...Huge fan now,toniw-22694,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a very informative, personal look at an impressive life of an incredibly talented man. Ray Parker Jr captured my attention in the early 80s. I had no idea of his rich experience from such an early age. The fact that he was able to maneuver through so many genres so well and remain true to himself shows character. Others who worked with him from the beginning throughout his career only spoke of his talent, drive and dedication to his craft also testifies to his genius. I look forward to hearing more from him in the future. Where can I get the soundtrack? I've searched all the websites.!",False
4,4,Bustin' Makes Me Feel Good!,ThatMonkey,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love music, I love documentaries and seriously love Ray Parker Jr, but this piece was trash! I grew up listening to Raydio and enjoyed Ray's music immensely. I was unaware of his child prodigy status and all the legends he worked with and wrote for. I think the doc did a decent, but not great by any stretch of painting that picture. Where this doc failed is there was no serious drama, it was too happy if not peaceful. How are you going to call this Documentary ""Who You Gonna Call"" and not even mention the lawsuit around the title of the song and feature?I'll be blunt, it took me a while to even hear the similarity between Ray's theme and the Huey song and knowing what we know about Ray it's highly unlikely that he would or need to steal anyone else's music! I never had a doubt it was his original composition, and this movie could have made that clearer for any that did doubt.They danced around the Leo Sayer issue which was teased in the trailer and just failed to make a cohesive engaging story. I was able to purchase this on sale and still feel like I paid too much!Ray is a man worthy of a substantial documentary and this is 100% not it. Don't waste you time, money, energy or effort on this stinker. This director is not fit to do community theater.",False

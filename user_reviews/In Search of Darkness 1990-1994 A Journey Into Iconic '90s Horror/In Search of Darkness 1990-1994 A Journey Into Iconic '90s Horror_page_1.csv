1,9,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),BlueBoyReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"The stage curtains open ...This awesome series of Horror Movie Nostalgia begins anew for another decade - the early 90's! Though I spent my teen years in the 80's, I connected more to the horror movies during these 5 years than the slasher era of the 80's. Don't get me wrong - I love the Halloweens and the Fridays and the Elm Streets ... but when horror started trending away from slasher into different areas, I was hooked.I was able to purchase the electronic copy of this 6 hour extravaganza online from CreatorVC at their website - and I am SO glad I did. Having watched and thoroughly enjoyed the previous 3 installments, I was even more excited to get my hands on this one. It covered some of my favorites, including a few of my personal all-time favorites with ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""Misery"", and ""Jacob's Ladder"". We had a great listing of some others I've always liked such as ""The Guardian"", the Chucky sequels, ""Tremors"", and ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"".The guest stars included a few from the previous series including John Carpenter, Heather Langenkamp, and Alex Winter. We had some new faces as well from in front of and behind the camera. I was very happy to see Jill Schoelen and Clancy Brown included and interviewed. I was, however, disappointed to see some of my other favorite films not discussed or highlghted, such as ""Body Parts"", ""Man's Best Friend"", and the dumbfounding exclusion of anything from the Alien movies. But, even so, they do an excellent job of hitting most of the popular titles, both in the United States and abroad.I had an absolute blast watching this documentary. Rarely have I been as enamored or sucked in by a film ABOUT films like I am with these. It almost gets a perfect rating, except for the exclusion of some of the titles I was hoping to see, and the inclusion of some others that are in areas I don't care for. I give this one a VERY high recommend to any horror enthusiast who grew up during those years, or who is interested in finding great films to watch from a past they never got to experience.",False

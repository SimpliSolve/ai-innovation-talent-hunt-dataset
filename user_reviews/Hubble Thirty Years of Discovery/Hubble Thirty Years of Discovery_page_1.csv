1,8,Good documentary but could be better.,apaksoy,n/a,16/08/2025,Watched all in one sitting. It was nice to get a refresher on some of the things I knew about the history of the Hubble telescope. Glad they did not give up on it after the tragic accident in 2003. Wish the documentary said more about how the telescope has actually contributed to our understanding of the space and stars.,False

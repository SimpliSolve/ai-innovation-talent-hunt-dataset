1,8,Really well done with nostalgic vibes,mayramb-127-472107,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a millennial born in the early eighties and I am also a Latin woman, so of course I know who Walter Mercado is, however I am not a spiritual person, and personally I never was a fan of him, but I saw this because I was bore. So it was a surprised that I felt so connected with this documentary, it was really nostalgic and I felt I understood him, he obviously was a really sensitive human being.
Some people might think he was messing with people, but I don't think so, I believe he really wanted to spread love and positivism and I think he was a happy person that lived the live he wanted.
I don't care about his sexuality but what I like the most about him, was his flamboyance, because it was so weird in the 90s to be different, and as his mother said to him, being different is good. So to the haters, that are saying that is terrible to do a documentary about someone who cheated people, please look for happiness and find love and positivism :)",False
2,6,Mildly interesting but definitely too long,borgolarici,n/a,15/08/2025,"Maybe I didn't fully enjoy the documentary because I'm neither Portorican nor American, but I found it definitely too long. Mercado is an interesting guy and his career is impressive, but the story felt repetitive.",False
3,7,So fun,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerEvery day for decades, Walter Mercado - the iconic, gender non-conforming astrologer - mesmerized 120 million Latino viewers with his extravagance and positivity. And then he was gone.In the film, Mercado defines himself as androgynous and insists that the primary relationship of his life is with his fans; he also jokes about being a virgin even in his advanced age. But man - what a magical world he created. His intros and his voice and his beyond Liberace outfits stand out in the macho world of Mexican television, a Puerto Rican performer just seamless fitting in while standing out at the same time.For as big a star as Lin-Manuel Miranda is, you can tell how humbled he is upon meeting Mercado. That human moment made this entire movie for me. It's exclusively on Netflix and well worth checking out.",True
4,n/a,"Netflix headline ""He Vanished"" is misleading.",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had never heard of him but love his sweet heart and kindness! I kept waiting for when he was abducted or something! He wasn't, he is awesome and had a great life with some bad things along the way. Worth watching for sure!!",False
5,6,World needs this kind of films,spacehunterdog,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm so happy this documentary. And btw. I had never heard about this Walter before.. Thanks to the crew for making this. Some film editing issues I was wondering about, but the main feeling was a joy.",False
6,10,"Never cared about him,but I was enthralled with this documentary",juanpablosegundo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Walter is an icon in Puerto Rico, but I didn't grow up there so he was just a distant name to me while growing up.
However, I gave this film a chance, and was moved by the simplicity of his message, and how intertwined he was in puerto rican life...
Very entertaining and moving documentary, total surprise",False
7,10,Iconic.,alexandras1304,n/a,15/08/2025,"I grew up seeing this fabulous icon on the television regularly, whether it was at my mom's, my abuelita's, or my tia's - all Hispanic children knew who he was. This documentary flawlessly depicted the loving, radiant, positive person that Walter Mercado was. May his legacy and philosophy continue on for ages.",False
8,10,The Late Great Walter Mercado,santurcedc,n/a,15/08/2025,"I use to see Walter Mercado on Univision television and on television during my visits to Puerto Rico. As a person of Puerto Rican ancestry born in New York City and living in Washington, D.C., seeing Walter Mercado on television was both fascinating and funny. I enjoyed watching the documentary of his life on Netflix because I learn things that I never knew about Walter Mercado. Even today when I am joking with my Puerto Rican, Afro Cuban, and Dominican friends, I always say Mucho Mucho Amor and we all breakout with laughter. This was Walter's trademark saying on Spanish television. RIP, Walter; Dios te bendiga.",False
9,10,Lovely surprise!,maryskywalker11,n/a,15/08/2025,"Growing up as an Anglo woman in South Carolina, Walter was not a household name for me. But I was intrigued by his story and watched this documentary with my mom! Neither of us had any expectations and both truly enjoyed this film! Very well done and highly intriguing.What a wonderful way to honor the legacy of such an iconic character who seemed to truly love life. I highly recommend this documentary!",False
10,5,Hagiography.,slyjimmyslim,n/a,15/08/2025,"Pure hagiography. This guy fleeced millions, then got fleeced, and we were supposed to feel sorry for him. The directors glossed right over this. If Bernie Madoff looked like Tammy Fay and worn a cape would he have been endearing too?I would have preferred knowing more about Walter, perhaps how he felt about scamming people, but there obviously wasn't anyrhing else to learn. The second half of the film was just for the hero worshipers and had nothing to offer people who have never heard of him.",False

12,10,All about love and positivity,cauxmichel-51894,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolutely right, he is not a Star anymore, he is a Constellation!

15,5,Outrageous!,fanispavlo,n/a,15/08/2025,One film about a man who played with the misery of the people. Outrageous. I think Bill Bakula's life will be more interesting.,False
16,10,Great story - love and diversity,Critic_For_Life,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerLooked like an interesting story about a person who I've never heard of. Watched Walter's story and loved it - not a mean bone in his body. Walter needed love and was secure when he was surrounded by those who loved him. He was a trusting man and unfortunately too trusting. But he loved people and he wanted to be happy. I would love to see a story about his earlier and formidable years.,True
17,10,What a beautiful soul,awakealready,n/a,15/08/2025,"Such a well made doc. The story flows so well and really takes you on a ride throughout Walter's incredible life.

Really enjoyed the movie.",False

20,1,Humbug.,kermithh,n/a,15/08/2025,"Astrology. Spells it all. Where's the Legend, Netflix?A hard bottle blonded Puerto Rican male in cape saying mucho mucho Amor a couple of times a minute. And people gives thie 10? I'm done.",False
21,10,El Gran Walter Mercado,rncareeva,n/a,15/08/2025,"All my life I had a curiosity about this eccentric person who was such a super star! I'm so happy this movie showed us a kind and gentle soul. I can't believe I cried like I did! I wasn't even a major fan, just That he's part of my childhood growing up... watching him in our house or during the news Primer Impacto! You will live forever!

22,10,Beautiful Homage,missmarcy-00645,n/a,15/08/2025,I grew up watching Walter Mercado. I would run to the TV everyday at the same time until he said my horoscope. I loved the way he would move his capes and the amazing outfits he would wear and his fancy jewelry. And that look in his eyes..... mesmerizing. Definitely loved this well deserved documentary. Well done!!! I highly recommend it. Super Double Thumbs Up!!!!,False
23,10,I miss him,mendoza_marlene,n/a,15/08/2025,"I grew up watching him while my parents were working, every day we would shut up and listen to our horoscopes and most of the time they were pretty spot on. The documentary really made me reminisce and miss those times and also realize that I've been kind of in a slump, I need to pick myself up and be fabulous again.",False
24,10,Heartwarming and Nostalgic,JuniorTorres720,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a heartwarming documentary on the life and times of an icon; Walter Mercado. I don't believe in astrology, but I can admit that growing up Walter Mercado was a staple of my upbringing. Growing up I remember watching him come on TV during Primer Impact and it was always an enjoyable moment. This documentary does a good job in presenting Walter in a humanistic way without bias. By the end of the documentary I was getting emotional and felt sad during his moments of hardship and death. I enjoyed this because it reminded me of my childhood. Even though I don't believe in astrology, I feel empathy for him because he was human like anyone else, and seemed to have a good heart.",False

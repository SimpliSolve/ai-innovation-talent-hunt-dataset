1,7,It was ok,smokebender,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a doc, what can I say. My main reason for commenting is I know the qanon anti-vax antimask folks are going to come out of the woodwork slamming the doc. Dunno why really beyond they can't seem to make it through life without trying to prove the majority of the planet is plotting to subjugate them in some manner. Regardless of their bs, they had to be vaccinated to attend school and a cloth mask is a better option than an oxygen mask and a casket. Prove we don't have somewhere close to 800k dead and maybe I'll listen. Dummasses.",False
2,7,Low reviews are from anti-Vaxxers,brydonpeter,n/a,16/08/2025,"It does a good job pointing out how insane and deranged these anti-vaxxers actually are, which is why you'll see a lot of low reviews from people. I consider it an average documentary considering virtually everything someone who's an anti-vaxxer spews out is a hoax or a brazen lie to begin with so between them and Q or flat-earthers they're the easiest targets on the planet.We need more documentaries like these and more people to stand up against anti-vaxxers to promote public health. There are enough of us that we can find camaraderie during pandemics like this but these people have to retreat to their own bubbles to keep their nonsense going. Thanks to online propaganda I know countless people who have lost their grandparents to this pandemic that could have been alive today if they were vaccinated. Any small side effects of a vaccine are worth living to see another day or not suffering the greater side effects of COVID-19 survival. You want to talk about extremely rare vaccine side effects but you won't talk about side effects of getting COVID eh? Anti-vaxxers are inherently idiots, and they're where the new variants will form to try and attack us.Alas the damaging propaganda mills are always out there. This documentary isn't meant for anti-vaxxers so any reviews made by people contradicting the facts are just angry anti-vaxxers. The documentary is meant for those of us who are terrified of them and want to get our dose of cringe material. I doubt it will change any minds but if people are super offended by it I'm glad. This documentary gives you a dose of my perspective and most of society considers anti-vaxxers deplorable anyway. Have a nice day~",False
3,9,Vaccines save lives,arete_1,n/a,16/08/2025,"...and have for a couple hundred years.We've had public restrictions due to disease for thousands of years (quarantine for instance) and vaccinations in the US since 1800 when Benjamin Waterhouse brought them here, and from 1802 - 1810 vaccinations were endorsed by US officials (including scientists and president Jefferson), made compulsory, and federal agencies were set up to study and administer them. And that was just the beginning of this life and health saving humane and socially responsible enterprise.Billions of lives have been saved by vaccination; in fact, many of us alive today wouldn't be if not for vaccinations saving our ancestors from early deaths in childhood: millions of children died in the US and other industrialized countries each year (with much lower populations btw) before widespread vaccinations started and steadily advanced in the 1800s and 1900s.This documentary shows how the intellectual and moral poverty of the socially irresponsible anti-vaccination movement threatens to return our public health to the dire days before vaccinations when child (and adult) early death were commonplace (a family with 3 children could expect at least 1 child to die from now preventable disease; many adults died in their 30's - 50's from disease).What is especially infuriating is that it need not be this way: because of human ingenuity and fearless, painstaking, concerted inquiry for centuries (often fighting against religious authorities that condemned such inquiry, with real threats of financial ruin, banishment, imprisonment and even death for such ""heresy""), we have largely conquered the scourges of the past in affluent nations (look to the less affluent to see how wretched our pre-vaccination past was) to ensure human well-being is more widespread than at any other time in our species' history. The know-nothing pseudo-scientific anti-vaccination movement threatens all this reality based hard work and progress, all this freedom from pain, suffering and death. And of all the tragedies in the world, nothing is more regrettable, and just outright evil, than wholly preventable pain, suffering and death due to human ignorance, irrationality, immaturity, and unjustified arrogance.Science is real, truth matters, reality is real (that's a tautology), freedom/bodily autonomy does not extend to allow individuals to infect others with deadly or crippling communicable diseases (the freedom from suffering and death, and the right to health and life, vastly outweighs the non-freedom and non-right to carry deadly or crippling communicable disease, full stop) and anyone who tells you otherwise has a malicious and personally beneficial political/financial agenda to advance.",False
4,n/a,Wrong title ;),n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don't take it too seriously, people, but in this particular context it should actually be ""Thinning of The Heard by Means of Willful Ignorance: The Essence of The Darwin Award In Process"". And by right so.",False
5,10,Anti-vaxx and fools won't like it,lorpotfr,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary expose the crooks maneuvering people since near 25 years to drive them buying their snake oil rather than vaccine. How amazing half a dozen people can drive millions to their doom, just for their very own personnal profit. So the docu shows you most of their narrative used to fool people. A must see by these dark times for reason !!!",False
6,1,Horribly One Sided!,heratyplant,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm genuinely disgusted that this was made by a British TV company & one that's supported by tax payers. This is such a distorted & one sided view & done so obviously & cynically.The producers/ directors so overtly only show balanced & even handed people to present their side & then show nutty looking/ sounding, swirly eyed conspiracy types, so stilted it's embarrassing as a show.This helps neither side & is extremely unhelpful, also, I would be very careful what you present as total fact, just moments after that fact, the future & history have a regular way of proving those people wrong. In this case that would be highly dangerous, even lethal.Most of the people being demonised in this film are not anti vaxers, but anti covid vaxers, that's quite a different thing, meaning that almost everything said in this is inaccurate.I have nothing to do with either side in this dreary missive, but I know when something is right for me & when it isn't, perhaps, if the producers had an equal inerrant probity, it would have been more than just misleading drivel.",False
7,10,a very clear and transparent documantary,statiksky,n/a,16/08/2025,"Right first off: all the 1 star reviews are clearly biased and brainwashed by the antivax rhetoric.Some say no sources were mentioned, whatever happened to do your own research? All the information in this documentary is easily found online. The bogus research by andrew wakeupfield, his financial gain, the lack of reproducing his research by other scientists (if his research was right then where are the other whistle blowers with valid research). These are hard undeniable facts.It's all being presented in easy bite size bits and show what's really behind the antivax movement. Even if you do know all the information presented in this documentary it's still interesting and might even provide some missing puzzle pieces.They always say ""follow the money!"" well we did and this is the result.""andrew wakefield, larry cook, del bigtree and robert f kennedy jr were asked to contribute to this documentary but were unavailable. Dr sherri tenpenny told us ""the idea that an individual such as myself is doing this for money... is obscene"" which basically says it all, they gave them the chance to speak out but they didnt have the time or something. I wonder why... (they prolly weren't offered $$$)",False
8,1,Veiling the Truth,zoolife,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anyone that has done their own research into the subject matter will see right through the heavy handed convoluted propaganda. Wishing everyone who sees this 'film' had the time to do their own independent investigation instead of taking the information presented here as a earnest attempt at balanced reporting.""Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?"" - Paula Cole.",False
9,9,Clearly the anti-vaxxers have been coming here to can this . .,ekolaric,n/a,16/08/2025,". .you only need to look at the ratings graph to see the affect on the average score.This is a rational and scientific presentation of the (scientifically proven, peer-reviewed) facts behind vaccination. The science behind vaccines is solid and only getting better (we were able to use RNA tech for C-19 to produce the vaccine faster and get it into testing faster).There is still no cure for viruses - nothing has changed there - our scientific knowledge is not that good yet. The vaccine doesn't stop you getting infected - it just progresses your body's immune system straight to ""producing and deploying effective anti-bodies"" stage of it's fight against the virus . .skipping all the ID'ing and experimenting stages to develop effective anti-bodies in the first place (we're all innate scientists on the inside), and thus reducing the time the virus has to do damage to the cells in our body. Less symptomatic damage to you, less viral load to spread to others - that's it, end of story.",False
10,1,Great propaganda documentary,MovieCriticOnline,n/a,16/08/2025,This was extremely difficult to watch. Right from the beginning they declare their bias so you now have to sit back and watch the rest of it knowing the filmmakers have a political angle which is never good in any documentary.Great documentaries just present the facts and let the audience decide. They should never slant the views of the audience.SKIP!!!,False
11,9,Clearly the Anti-Vaxxers have organised to bring the average score down,ekolaric,n/a,16/08/2025,". .just look at the graph and it's clear.This is a rational and science-based presentation of the facts behind vaccination. No it won't stop you getting C-19 . .or any other virus - there's STILL NO CURE FOR VIRUSES - nothing has changed there . .our science knowledge is not that good yet. BUT, vaccination is the absolute best we have - it ensures a much better symptomatic/health outcome for those infected, and a greatly reduced viral load for infecting others.It's very simple - think of it like a mugshot for police to identify criminals - they know what the perp looks like so they don't have to start from square one in their investigation, thus saving a heap of time finding the perp, and limiting the damage they can do in the future. Similarly, your body's immune system doesn't have to start from square one to fight off the virus - it already knows what to look for . .vaccination is just infecting you with a weakened version of the virus so it has a model/plan to produce anti-bodies should the body get infected with it again.It's always going to be a simple race against time: your immune system's speed in A) identifying a (viral) infection, then B) experimenting with creating effective anti-bodies to fight it off, then C) producing/deploying those antibodies -VS- the speed that the virus can infect/damage the cells in your body and reproduce itself. If your body can skip straight to C in the process it's way ahead of the game and the amount of potential damage a virus can do is (logically) limited. End of story.",False
12,10,Nailed it,nrslori,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having been part of dispelling antivaccine misinformation for decades myself, I found this documentary to be extremely thorough and accurate. They clearly presented the majority of the AV talking heads for what they are and how they spin misinformation to spread FUD- Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. Vaccine misinformation has been around since the discovery of vaccines. CoVid brought it to the front page.",False
13,1,Rise of the college film maker,vintagevaultarcade,n/a,16/08/2025,Clearly biased documentary and just pure lazy film making. I feel like I was watching a student made film. Avoid if you are seriously curious about both sides of this issue.,False
14,10,The cult,elizabrbarbosa,n/a,16/08/2025,"Good to understand that money is behind anti-vaxx movement. An excellent job was made here. History will show us who is right. Former doctor Andrew Wakefield has founded an obscurantist cult. Money used to save lives (with profit, in capitalism) is better than money from naive minds to generate evitable deaths.",False
15,1,If you have to make a film,elfinspace23,n/a,16/08/2025,"Follow the science, but yet again it might as well come from the news, or Gov Health Advisors who never cite their sources. Any sources cited are often from interested parties so never neutral.And i am over the one directive to rule them all, Freedom of speech is more important than imprisoning people for speaking it.Not credible on any front and 90% of diseases can easily be explained away with sanitation, clean water, refrigeration, clean drinking water and general world improvements.",False
16,10,Vaccines save lives,AMAssis,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is not a work of art, but it is precise and straight to the point. And it explains beautifully well how antivaxxers operate. But you can also find that out reading the comments from people giving it 1-star ratings.",False
17,1,Absolute PROPAGANDA for TV muppets,mmrozowska,n/a,16/08/2025,"I actually support mandatory vaccination, especially the recent one as we need more space and oxygen for those who are able to think for themselves...
As a scientist myself I believe that proper science is constant questioning everything, disagreeing and probing. This is how we learn and discover new things. These days science is based on how much money one can make... Sorry but this is not science at all, and is absolutely disgusting to endorse such thing.Anyone believing that Big Pharma is there to help is delusional!!! If you look at their history, they have failed at providing safety and effectiveness again and again. Multibillion lawsuits are the greatest proof of who they are. List of their failures and lies is endless. Patient cured is a customer lost and they will never allow it.A properly made documentary would have both sides explaining their take on the things and let the audience decide what they think is right. The problem is, audience these days is not supposed to think for themselves as this is the biggest threat to the ruling class...",False
18,1,There was no vaccine.,Keester,n/a,16/08/2025,"There was no vaccine. A symptom suppressant was what it was at best. You could still catch it. You could still pass it onto others. What a crock of utter bull calling this a vaccine. The human body has a fantastic immune system that with proper diet and exercise can be maintained in perfect condition and do more for you than any man-made chemical can.When I was 6 I got meningitis. No vaccine for this disease at that time.As a pre-teen I got mumps. No vaccine for this disease at that time.As a pre-teen I got measles. No vaccine for this disease at that time.As a pre-teen I got chicken pox. No vaccine for this disease at that time.As an adult I didn't catch covid and have never had the flu. I didn't need any chemical to make that happen. My immune system took care of me.I and many others survived all these. I only know of ONE PERSON who didn't.Our immune systems fought and protected us. Good fresh, unprocessed, no added chemicals, preservatives etc kept our immune system in perfect order.The diets of today, pizza, chips, packaged this and that are destroying what nature gave us.Be healthy folks. You don't need food processors to make you sick so that Big Pharma can keep you on medicine for the rest of your life.",False
19,2,"Is this ""documentary"" a joke?",MrAmedeo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really tried to watch this with an open mind, however spent the entire time feeling puzzled.Was this supposed to be satire?No credible sources cited, no factual evidence provided.Outside of a vaccinologist (who is under the impression that babies can tolerate ""10,000 vaccines at once"" and is funded by Merck), their credible sources were 2x people from the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, 1x financial investigator, 1x random dude with nothing better to do than follow the vaxxed bus around with a sign and a high school student, who wasn't aware you can vaccinated at any local GP or hospital . Not exactly what I would call credible sources.I felt this ""documentary"" was created to discourage and discredit any open conversations about vaccinations.I watched this in the hopes that there might be some statistical facts provided. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. Very disappointing and very biased.",False

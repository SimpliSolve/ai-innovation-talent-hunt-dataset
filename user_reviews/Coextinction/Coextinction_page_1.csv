1,10,Important and Beautifully Shot,TigerHeron,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not a ""Save the Whales"" movie; it's about the destruction of an entire ecosystem in the Pacific Northwest. The movie starts with the plight of Orcas, and moves on to the destruction of the wild salmon population that is the main reason behind the Orcas' decline and which also threatens the lives of the indigenous people of the area. If you thought Jay Inslee was an environmentalist, you might think differently after watching this movie. I look forward to hearing more about what can be done. I saw this film via the Mill Valley Film Festival.",False

3,9,thrilling and educational at the same time,oliverc-93851,n/a,16/08/2025,"U get this feeling watching docu-movies from Netflix (Virunga) but here it gets even better. Even tho this movie fills u with info about different species and their role in our environment u still feel like watching an action movie. Another thing that makes this docu one of the best I saw, is the big picture it tries to show. It talks not only depicts one problem but its overall impact on communities animal or human ones(indigenous people. So this movie doesnÂ´t only have beautifully shot and narrated shots of orcas, it also has its own story full of politics, hero stories of activists, and just a lot of survival.",False
4,10,"Deeply moving, a must-watch for all",nielsonshelby,n/a,16/08/2025,"Extremely moving, educational, and a must-watch for all ages. A great representation of a 'One Health' issue that needs more attention and action. As a BC resident this documentary hits home to the critical state of our changing ecosystem, and the losses we will face if these issues continue to be ignored. The storytelling and cinematography in this film are absolutely beautiful, with the potential to inspire change to a wide range of audiences. I continue to think about this film after viewing and hope it can become widely available for more to see soon. Thank you to the Coextinction team for the creation of this incredible film.",False

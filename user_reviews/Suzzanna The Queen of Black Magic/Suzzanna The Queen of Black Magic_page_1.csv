1,8,A whole new world,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerNearly unknown in the United States, Suzzanna Martha Frederika van Osch - better known as Suzzanna - was crowned the queen of Indonesian horror.The youngest of six Javanese-Minahasan-Sundanese-German-Dutch children born to singer Johanna Bojoh and actor Willem Van Osch, Suzanna started acting in 1958, winning a contest to appear in Usmar Ismail's Asrama Dara. By the end of the 1960s, she was married to actor Dicky Suprapto - who this film gets into, as he left her and would not grant a divorce - and then, by 1972, she was the most popular actress in the country. Her film Bernafas dalam Lumpur had a frank depiction of sexuality that was incendiary in its home country, leading to it being banned.Suzanna's real fame came from her horror films. With long black hair and a terrifying stare - sort of like an Indonesian Barbara Steele - Suzzanna played frightening villains in a series of movies that thrilled and also frightened audiences. She also kept the appearances of magic up in the stories of her personal life, as some claimed that she prayed to a ""lady of the sea"" and that she drank jasmine flowers to remain young. Or that story that when she made Nyi Blorong that the wig of snakes that was placed on her head was calm whenever it was near her.Her death - said to be from diabetes complications - in 2008 was just as mysterious as the life that she led, to the point that some claimed she was murdered.What she leaves behind is a career filled with many movies playing women done wrong. That's apparent in nearly every actress' career. Where she differs is that once the act has been done to her, she returns and gets her comeuppance. Sure, her back may be leaking and leeches could be pouring out of them. But then she'd affix that stare at her enemies and found a dignity that many women done wrong in cinema never attain.Directed by David Gregory, this documentary combines clips of her most famous films with interviews with family members, colleagues, filmmakers and historians. What emerges is exactly what should from a film like this: a burning desire to seek out all of Suzzanna's films and devour them with the magical appetite she used to chow down on 200 satay sticks and an entire vat of soup in Sundelbolong.",True
2,9,The horror ... Queen,kosmasp,n/a,17/08/2025,"No pun intended - the documentary itself begins with quite the high stakes ... or a statement that is ... well I am not sure it will go down well with many horror movie fans ... unless they are able to take it with a grain of salt. Because I doubt many knew of Suzzanna ... I sure had no idea who that was - same is true for most if not all the others who attended the festival I saw this at.All that aside (and hopefully you are able to push that and some other things aside), the documentary is really well done. We know Severin Films is capable that way and capacity. They speak to survivors (people who are still alive, family members and friends as well as co workers and fans) ... and there is a bit of a mystery regarding the later stages of her life ... I would not go as far as calling this ... well the focus is more on her life than how and why she died.The movies she did before Suzzanna, especially the ones that can be called Horror (though they do look like a lot of fun, if you can laugh at some nasty and blood filled effects - that have dated quite badly ... or in a funny way) ... I want to watch them! I kind of hope Severin puts some of them out ... they look like a ""hoot"" as they say.Suzzanna and the man she married ... well let's say some may feel there is a bit of a cringe element to it. Especially considering the emphasis on the characters they played (the relationship between them) ... very first time on screen and very last time ... you'll understand, I hope you are prepared enough for this.I am curious to see what kind of set Severin will release and while I think the Bruce Lee documentary will top this ... this is a fun watch too ... even if as most you have no clue who that was ...",False

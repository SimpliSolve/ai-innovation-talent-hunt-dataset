1,5,Great subject matter. Mediocre film.,ubikpkd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Obviously hampered by a low budget, this contains almost no original recordings. Instead, his ""talent"" is described by numerous talking heads and musicians playing examples of his brilliant piano playing. Also includes some footage of what appears to be one of the few video interviews he did. Directed by Michael Treen - his only film as director, this appears to be a labor of love and while that can be appreciated, it's not much more than audio version of a music magazine article. Treen is better known for being a prolific television producer and should probably stick to his strengths in the future. If you love the subject matter, give it a watch on a slow night, just don't go in expecting a great film.",False

1,8,"""I was happy when I took pictures.""",aethomson,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary consists almost entirely of the (still) photographs taken by Micha Bar-Am, famous for his work in the New York Times and for the Magnum organisation. He was born in Germany in 1930, and the family moved to Israel in 1936. Many of the images are of Israel's wars, not just the ""action"" but also faces of onlookers or people taking part. His best pictures are amazing, and should be studied by connoisseurs of the photographic arts.Mixed in with this ""documentation of history"" are family photos. The voice-over consists mainly of family members talking to Micha Bar-Am about his pictures, and what their lives together have been like. The English-language sub-titles are usually easy to read.What exactly is happening in some of these pictures is not clearly explained, but this documentary is only incidentally a history of Israel since 1957. What really counts is the emotional charge conveyed by what a camera can capture, here mostly in black-and-white.",False
2,6,Novel in style and a bit quirky.,kollek-628-104144,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler1341 Frames of Love and WarThe movie is a glimpse of history, both national and personal, through the photographs of Micha Bar Am narrated by him and his wife Orna in interview.The nature of the pictures lends itself to an anecdotal take on events rather than a grand historic sweep. As a result we get an intimate close-up of events interspersed with their lives, sometimes covering periods we lived (and are living) through with them.Micha muses about photography, about how/why he spent so much time photographing war and death, what effect it had on him and how he tried to balance his portfolio by taking pictures of birth and celebration. The relationship between Micha and Orna is sweet. He is a philosopher and she is a firecracker. He will tell a story and she will correct him or ask pointed questions.Post film there is a springboard to debate the role of journalism and whether you can be an objective recorder of history.The film is a bit long and some of the photos are better than others. That said it is novel in its style and a bit quirky.",True

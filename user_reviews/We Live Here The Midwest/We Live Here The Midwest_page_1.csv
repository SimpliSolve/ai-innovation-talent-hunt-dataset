1,10,"More of this, please!",deeannah,n/a,16/08/2025,"An honest depiction of families in the Midwest facing judgment for simply being who they are. I'm grateful to all of them for their candor and bravery. I would love to see similar profiles from other so called red states, and also from seemingly progressive enclaves which can also be homes to bigotry. I'm not surprised to see people jumping in here to give as few stars as possible, most likely without having watched a bit of this important program. My wish is that those people at least try to understand what it must feel like to suppress their authenticity in order to exist safely, and what sort of a toll that must take.",False
2,10,Queer People Are Good Normal People,indagar,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very important documentary before the presidential election in the US: Human Rights for the LGBT Community are decisive and nowadays in danger because of right-radical movements. To watch the testimonies helps to understand that any queer member of our society is as important as any other citizen and they have to be seen and protected.It'd be great to have a continuation to get to know how the anti gay movement has affected last year these families. Hopefully there will be another solutions besides to move to another state, where the legislation is really open and modern and acknowledges diversity.",False

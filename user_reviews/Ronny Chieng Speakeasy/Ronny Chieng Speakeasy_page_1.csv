1,7,Not a total loss,NatashaWM,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've been waiting for this special for weeks, and while I'm glad I watched it, I prefer his past work.Ronny's performance is decent, but is not as harmonious, or humourous, as his previous Netflix special. To me his demeanor seems rather tense, frustrated at times, and in certain parts he's almost nervous. I laughed several times, but I also had several moments when I felt uncomfortable. I'm not easily offended, so I ultimately enjoyed the show, and I see myself watching more of Ronny's comedy specials if he releases them.",False
2,6,Repeated the same sentences for too many times,makaylagan,n/a,15/08/2025,"On multiple occasions, he repeated the same sentence for too many times. I think the show would be better if it's not that repetitive. I like his previous special better.",False
3,6,Wasn't his worst but prefer the older material,rickvanryke,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was repetitive to a point that it was a bit annoying, I understand where he was coming from with certain jokes and such but left me feeling somewhat uneasy. Did have good jokes but felt more worn out than some of his older work.",False
4,6,Another Funny Special With a Worldly Perspexctive,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ronnie Chieng is a very finny stand up comedian. This Netflix special is very funny. He is smart and very cutting in his attack on modern cynicism and psuedo-intellectualism. I love the club setting of this one in NYC. It looks a little like it is out of Casablanca. This is an ""R"" rated version of his demeanor on The Daily Show. He is a very bright guy. HIs understanding of the world is very metropolitan. His perspective, from having lived in so many different places of the world is very interesting and informed.",False
5,n/a,Old work is definitely funnier,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"The whole time it just felt like rather than telling jokes, he was showcasing his anger toward anyone who isn't far-left. The material didn't exactly age well with the ""science"" either. I really enjoyed his 2019 special but this one just isn't it.",False
6,7,Chuckled at most of it,ImNickJames,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI enjoy his style and energy which entertained me as much as his last special. As far as the comments on the UK goes (and the morons who clapped in the audience)... Mr Bean is not the G. O. A. T or standard of comedy in the UK but he's also clearly never heard of Black Adder. We have Dylan Morgan, Bill Bailey, Simon Pegg, Michael McIntyre, James Acaster (who he mentions), Billy Connoly, Ricky Jervais, Lee Evans, Frankie Boyle, Kevin Bridges, the entire cast of Monty Python, just to name a few!",True
7,8,Fresh perspective,motorcitywebgirl-271-11897,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really enjoyed his latest special, and found it quite unique and funny. He focused on a truly fresh perspective- global, intelligent, clever and timely. Reading some of the reviews of people who panned it... I think it went over their heads. More, please.",False
8,3,Setups that didn't pay off,trigunnerd,n/a,15/08/2025,"As another reviewer said, he was very repetitive sometimes, and it fell short. ""Cancel me. Cancel me! C'mon, cancel me. Cancel meeeee."" He also did at least 3 setups that fell flat, with the live audience and myself. He'd do this big build-up, then tell a switcharoo joke that wouldn't quite land. And while I agree with most of what he said during his soapboxing, it's all been said by every comedian these past three years.",False
9,8,Revealing & riveting,estathena2,n/a,15/08/2025,"Reminiscent of Carlin & Hicks, Ronny Chieng's Speakeasy is a sharp take on life in a post-pandemic world, especially in the United States. Wielding a sardonic wit, Ronny shines a telling light on a societal illness - ignorance over information; those who vilify education, science, and take pride in their prejudices.Warning to those who dare enter this comedic misanthrope's den, leave your egos at the door or risk insult and injury by the mirror's reflection.",False
10,2,Its like watching a very bad roast on society,alexouns-83206,n/a,15/08/2025,It's one of those stand ups that starts off aggressively to give you the impression of this dude got some balls for taking on controversial subjects that he drags on way too long with the anticipation of getting better or funnier perhaps but that delayed train never arrives.,False
11,8,I enjoyed the hubris,hardworker-46201,n/a,15/08/2025,"An hour went by quickly which is a good sign for me, I felt it got better towards the end. Highlighting the culture of unqualified and overly critical so what online bullying in a funny way was excellent and a very real issue.Those that gets pissed off about the UK joke and Mr bean needs to relax as that was part of the joke too. - I am British btw! Do you not think that one or 2 bad experiences from one or 2 encounters resulting in open hatred is not a problem in society? People do it all the time, try to understand the paradox- do you think you can make these points as funny if not funnier yourself? I mean you might not like the jokes but 1 or 2 stars is just unjust lol. I do prefer his other work more but I appreciated this one too. Yellow lives matter my friends!",False
12,5,So so.,TreeFiddy53,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ehhh...it was okay with a few chuckles every now and then. We've seen this kinda content from him before and from others before, so it wasn't anything new. Play it in the background while you cook or clean.",False
13,8,Keyboard warrior!,pamelaandpaolo,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't normally review content on IMDb, but I had to for this one. Ronny brings a worldly perspective not unlike that of Trevor Noah that I only started to cultivate after leaving the US, living abroad, and seeing things from the outside looking in. Might be harder for Americans who never leave to appreciate those aspects of the special. I came to checkout whether folks indeed took to their keyboards to review this special and I was not disappointed. And this special did not disappoint me either. 8/10 stars.",False
14,2,Time vortex of boredom,johnpgatt,n/a,15/08/2025,In the last 30 minutes I've checked 3 times too see how long it's got to go.. he spent the last 20 minutes insulting the intelligence of anybody who may give him a negative review which is exactly why I'm here. I gave him two stars because it's roughly how many chuckles I got your entire show.. he spent ages setting up jokes repeating himself and more than once forgot to add in the punchline at the end. A good editor could cut this show into a 2 minute entertaining YouTube video. If you watch a trailer you're guaranteed to see every funny part in the show..,False
15,8,How Not To Like Ronnie Chieng?,johanluce-473-14644,n/a,15/08/2025,"How not to like Ronnie Chieng?The guy is smart and funny AF. His stand up performance has a great rhythm and just the right amount of anger. I've seen him on some comedies and on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah and he's become one of my favorites.Yes, some of the topics may be considered as controversial to some, but that's the concept here.Highly recommended.",False
16,1,The jokes never came,anbraman,n/a,15/08/2025,"First special was so good. This was a disaster, turned it off twenty minutes in. Didn't laugh once. Was more like a Ted talk. The jokes never came. THE JOKES NEVER CAME!",False
17,10,I LOVED IT!!,aem-capello,n/a,15/08/2025,"Best comedy show that I have seen in years, I enjoyed it from start to finish! It made me completely forget to worry about any personal or current global problems - a huge
accomplishment these days.Thank you Ronny Chieng for making us laugh and smile, I loved it!!",False
18,3,Disappointed - the bar is higher for such a comedy veteran.,anthonynagy,n/a,15/08/2025,"I enjoyed his previous work - this material felt like he took notes from other comedians just talking on podcasts. Lacking innovation or creativity. Subjects like ""internet trolls are worthless"" and ""anti-vaxers are uneducated"" are part of our everyday conversations. I agree with both statements, but there should be more to such a ""work of art"" than just stating the obvious. It was so surprising to me, when he finished a thought and moved on to the next one, without having added anything new or original. Also it felt awkward when he said it's so easy to just criticize, compared to lift people up, when so much of this show is cheap shots. Looking forward to him stepping up his game in future. He's got the talent and the experience. I just see this one as a slip-up.",False
19,10,"The ""dumbass D-average"" generation he talks about are rating this 1!",brandingczars,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of the best comedy hour that I have invested my time into! Most importantly, this is what we need today; someone standing up against the pathetic stupidities of illiterate morons that are making the planet dumber every day. Thanks Ronny for doing this! You are an Invaluable Gem and this was a Masterpiece!",False
20,3,"much talk, little work",erdemhali,n/a,15/08/2025,"He spent the last part insulting the intelligence of anyone who might criticize him, and that's exactly why I'm here. I gave the gentleman three stars because I smiled three times in the entire show. A good vlogger could break this show down into a fun 3 minute Vimeo video. And in this video, you can see every funny part of the show. Unfortunately...",False
21,8,Best I've seen in a while,CanadianBear,n/a,15/08/2025,This is the most I've enjoyed standup in quite some time. It made me want to look up more of Ronny's work. I liked some of the smart jokes about COVID and cultural differences.,False
22,1,Angry Ronny,lindaklu,n/a,15/08/2025,"As an Asian American I wanted to support Ronny. His first work was really funny and I really enjoyed. What the heck happened? Got offended when he kept going on and on why he hates British people and I'm not even British. Was he high and didn't know what he was doing or something? He kept repeating phrases over and over again at least 12 times and it was getting extremely annoying. He seemed so angry, bitter and forceful, at one point he threw a glass of water at the audiences I feel bad for them for trying to laugh it off. Super disappointing. We didn't pay to watch you getting angry and rude.",False
23,10,As real as it gets.,prnyc11,n/a,15/08/2025,"If a standup comedy show doesn't make you feel like a buddy/friend is entraining you for an hour or so in your living room or wherever then what you experienced was anything but a standup. Ronny, with this special special has managed to do just that. Speakeasy or go home. Thanks for standing up.",False
24,3,Comedian forgets his Punch lines,midgard-83307,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think he's a funny guy typically; he seems to usually aim towards Left wing politics a lot in his jokes which is fine because he's usually funny. The last special was hilarious but this time it felt like he was out of material shortly after starting. The amount of times he repeated ""That's the ups and downs of comedy"" or repeated the Mr Bean impression was a bit embarrassing; and then the part where he kept trying to make sure he didn't offend his left wing audience......oh boy ""This was a younger me, less experiences me....a younger me etc etc"" for 3 minutes was just like he was nervous to even tell his joke. It's odd considering how he easily bashes the intelligence of anyone with a differing opinion than his during the pandemic.I agreed with his last part ironically about reviewers online bashing his ""craft"" or anyone's craft in entertainment while not themselves knowing the craft; there is truth there for sure but it wasn't funny and as with most of his other ""jokes"" it felt more like a rant than anything.Hopefully his next special is funny and he gets new material.",False
25,8,Thanks for making me laugh,maytekinaliyeva,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI like Ronny. His this show was also quite funny. I especially liked the exam joke (Cambridge) 😀😀 and Shakespeare's famous vending machine quote 😀
I am not British, but I love Mr. Bean. He is my childood comedian . He is fun come on 😔",True

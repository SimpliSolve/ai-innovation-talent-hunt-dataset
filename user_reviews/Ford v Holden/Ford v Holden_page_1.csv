1,5,It's good - but have been much better,johnr_roberts,n/a,15/08/2025,"Overall, quite entertaining - didn't like the red half-screens throughout, though.A few inaccuracies crept in (in fact, the whole documentary was more about the 'vibe' than the facts) - the main correction needing to be made was that Ford ALSO submitted a plan to the Australian Federal Government (in 1945) to build motor cars here - at no startup cost to the Australian taxpayer - unlike Holden, who was funded at startup and propped-up during its lifetime to the tune of 2 billion dollars.And 'the HQ Holden went through to the end of the 70s'. Uh, no, the model designation ended in 1974; in its varying configurations and names the HQ chassis lived on till 1984. And then they had the 'DUNNY MAN' hosting, instead of a really-knowledgeable guy like John Goss? P-lease.The most glaring omission is the complete lack of mention of Chrysler (and the Leyland P76 - they could have deleted all the multiple-repeated footage and stuck it in there!), despite Valiants and Chargers continually appearing in Bathurst racing footage! Chrysler actually started the Ford-Holden 'power race' with the V8 Valiant released in 1965! It wasn't called 'The Big Three' for nothing, you know.Hell, even Toyota got a mention! They then showed a Chrysler Sigma whilst implying it was built in Japan! Chrysler also projected a upmarket image for its vehicles that was never mentioned, but that kept the other two honest.",False

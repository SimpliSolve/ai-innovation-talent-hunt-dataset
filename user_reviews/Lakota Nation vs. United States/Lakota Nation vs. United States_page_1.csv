1,8,history from Lakota perspective,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Let's face it. The vast majority of U. S. educated folks have ""learned"" most of their Native American history from short segments in high school classes and from the portrayals in movies and TV shows. It seems fair to admit that these have been mostly one-sided tales. Well, here comes co-directors Laura Tomaselli and Jesse Short Bull to provide a detailed history from the Native American perspective, and I feel confident that many of you will find it as disturbing as I did.This history dates back to the arrival of Europeans, but the focus here is on the mid-1800's forward. We learn there have been more than 400 Treaties between the United States government and Native American tribes, with each successive 'agreement' whittling away a bit more of the land set aside for those who were already here. The film begins with some general history lessons, including the Dakota 38, where, in 1862, the U. S. government hanged 38 members of the Dakota tribe in the largest mass execution in U. S. history. The film's focus is then further narrowed to the Lakota tribe and the Black Hills of South Dakota.Native American poet Layli Long Soldier provides a voice and a bit of structure throughout, and her recurring ""X marks the spot"" carries significant weight regarding the treaties, the lack of understanding by tribal leaders, and the land itself. Parts one and two are labeled 'Extermination' and 'Assimilation', respectively, and we learn about the 150+ boarding schools that were more like boot camps designed to indoctrinate the natives ... including the slogan, ""Kill the Indian, save the man.""
The history is presented in mostly chronological order, and we see how the Lakotas continue the battle over their land - demanding reparations, the protection of clean waters, and the prevention of oil pipelines. This is the mission of the ""Landback"" movement, as their leaders share their (justified) anger and history with us. In recent years, the movement received a jolt when Donald Trump staged a July 4th celebration at Mount Rushmore, a particularly sacred land within the Black Hills of South Dakota. This lack of respect inspired many protests.This is an exceedingly compelling documentary. It teaches us history in a manner that stimulates emotions on a subject from a perspective most of us have never considered ... yet it is so crucial to the Lakota. Their ongoing struggle to reclaim their land is underscored by the fact that the Lakota continue to refuse the substantial monetary settlements offered by the government, choosing instead to hold fast to their demands of having the land returned to them.Opens on July 14, 2023.",False
2,10,Beautiful film,whess,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's an unusual documentary. Its artistry elevates it beyond the standard talking heads variety. It's a beautiful, poetic, and heartbreaking tribute to the Lakota people and to the land and helps viewers understand why this struggle that's been going on for so many years should not be ignored. The film's pacing at first might seem slow but it's an appropriately thoughtful and somewhat nonlinear approach that suits this unique film. It was very impactful and I feel drawn to watch it again because it has so many layers.The cinematography is beautiful and the archival footage is fascinating (and some of it reveals our disturbingly racist past).",False
3,10,One Of The Few Times In Mass Media We See Native Americans Telling Their Stories,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lakota Nation vs. United States educates and entertains with hard-hitting interviews and lyrical narration. It's an incredible watch for history buffs, especially those looking to learn more about a significant moment in US history.A chronicle of the Lakota people and their homeland of the Black Hills, Lakota Nation vs. United States traces the journey of a marginalized people. It starts with the Indian Wars of the 1800s, describes how sacred land was stolen in violation of treaty agreements. It progresses through the centuries all the way to today, as people protest a most ironic shrine to white supremacy, Mount Rushmore, and continue to call for the recognition of their tribal rights.The film is unique for a variety of reasons. First, it's co-directed by Jesse Short Bull - an Oglala Lakota man - and Laura Tomaselli, one of the few times in mass media we see Native Americans telling their stories. It is a wonderful touch that provides the whole film with a spirit of warmth and respect. The film is written and narrated by acclaimed Oglala poet Layli Long Soldier, and its narration will be the first thing to strike you in Lakota Nation vs. United States. The rhythmic refrain of ""X marks the spot,"" the soft, dignified, yet strong voice of Long Soldier, and the emotional roller-coaster of the story are truly mesmerizing. Tomaselli also serves as the editor of the film, and she, along with cinematographer Kevin Phillips use a wealth of archival and modern footage and rousing interviews with activists and leaders to tell this beautiful story of a land and a people who have survived exploitation, forced migration, and genocide, and who still wait for justice to come.Lakota Nation vs. United States promotes resilience, valuing culture, standing up to oppression, and honoring history. The Lakota provide us with so many lessons from which to learn and grow into better versions of ourselves.I give Lakota Nation vs. United States 5 out of 5 stars, and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 plus adults. It releases July 21, 2023 in select markets and will roll out later to other locations. By Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!",False
4,2,I gave it a chance... but far too unbalanced,pensacolacomputer,n/a,16/08/2025,"I tried watching this. I really really tried and gave it my best effort. This is one side of the story, as always there is another side to the story. Does this documentary go into that side? No, no it doesn't. Is it a balanced documentary? No, no it isn't.I cannot think of another country besides the United States of America, where a group of people do not have to pay taxes and was given a part of a countries land, and didn't win the war. And let's not beat around the bush, this was a war that the Indians lost.Now of course the Indians were at war with each other long before they came. Different tribes were killing each other for their land and resources. Does this documentary get into that? No, of course it doesn't because that would go against what this documentary is trying to do.Does the documentary ever give a sense of gratitude that they were able to keep part of the land and pay no taxes, which is unlike any other country on earth? No....no it doesn't.2/10- A one-sided story that doesn't give you the other side at all. Not a good documentary.",False

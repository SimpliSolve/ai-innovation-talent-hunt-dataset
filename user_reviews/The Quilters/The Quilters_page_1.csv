1,9,Wish it was longer!,ktmuls,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerQuilters really moved me. It's a beautiful, honest short doc on Netflix about men in a high-security prison making quilts for foster kids. Watching them work together, find purpose, and be genuinely proud of what they created was emotional and inspiring. It showed such a human, hopeful side of prison life that we rarely get to see. The care they put into each stitch was incredible. I loved seeing how much care they put into each quilt, knowing it would bring comfort to a child. I just wish it had been longer-I wanted more time with their stories and more of that amazing, healing quilting project.",True
2,9,Heartwarming and Sincere,ssangha-21515,n/a,16/08/2025,"'You've got to forgive yourself before you forgive others'.You might think this is a piece of sentimental fluff, but when it's spoken by a man who's spent 40 years in prison, it carries weight and meaning.Some prisoners coming together for a project is a familiar theme, but in this doc, you can feel how they express their soul through their creative vision. Like 'Chill' who has to act tough outside but makes beautiful butterfly quilts for little girls. He expresses the feminine part of his personality, acquired from his mom, through these quilts. I felt terrible for the man who took back a razor and fabric he was working on back to the cell. He could never see the full fruits of his vision.Loved the documentary and the inmates. It gives hope for humanity.",False
3,9,Why isn't this a series?!,souplahoopla,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely loved this short film. And I was so disappointed when it ended.This film follows a program in a prison where prisoners with good behaviour join a quilting class.What is so lovely about this film is that you see the prisoners express themselves creatively through quilting for foster children. Something you probably wouldn't expect from hardened criminals. I wish this was a series. I wish we could learn more about them and their crimes and their outreach programs. I feels like there was something of value to learn here. They take real pride in what they're doing.It's definitely worth watching, I do recommend.",False
4,10,I was crying with pride watching this,MovieLists83,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this short, Quilters. Even though I don't know any of these men I was literally crying with pride for these guys. They should be proud of themselves they are putting good into the world. Ive been in situations myself where I relied on the charity of others and I can say receiving something you know someone out work, effort and care into really is heart warming. I know the kids receiving these quilts would be absolutely loving them. It was so touching too that weighted quilts were being made also for autistic children. Overall lovely documentary. Wish there were more episodes to watch, I would watch more.",False
5,10,We need a whole series!,tasharoo-80298,n/a,16/08/2025,This was a beautiful documentary that I could watch for hours and hours!I loved seeing these men put their time and energy into creating and truly caring about making a lovely quilt for a foster child. They thoughtfully plan the designs and enjoy coming up with patterns & colors.Did I love this because I also make quilts? 100%! Does it make me excited to make another quilt? 100%. But I also think everyone would enjoy this Quilting story. Truly moving. I got emotional when a thank you not was read.Get this sewing program in all the prisons and each episode can be a new prison quilt guild!! I would be an avid watcher!,False
6,10,Tears started and didn't stop,erikamdaniels,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a quilter, as a quilter who makes for community projects, as a former foster mother, as a human, this is one of the most touching documentaries.So many words of wisdom from these men. They have stumbled and fallen. They know they can't do anything to change what they've done. But they try, in the quilting studio, to change things by letting foster children know they are thought of and loved.The artistry they are putting into each quilt is stunning. The care and pride they have for their works is so beautiful. Seeing how touched they are when they are thanked by the children is so sweet.We all can do better. These men are showing they too, can do better.",True
7,10,Spreading love and kindness,wemmies-306-317956,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was brilliant! We need this all across America! Giving these men an avenue of giving pure kindness, love, hope, joy, tenderness, and beauty is wonderful! I want to send them fabrics and thread and needles and a letter and all the things!I cried at the good energy this documentary sent out into the world in the most unexpected way! I would watch this weekly if it were a series. In the short time I was so sad Fred didn't get to finish and what happened to Jimmy! The good energy intertwined me with these guys heart.I also love that most of them spoke so fondly of their mother... what a gift for their mothers to have in this format shared with the world. We all make mistakes. We all could find ourselves in unexpected situations. We all hope for the ability to restore ourselves with hope and kindness.Sooo good! Bravo!",True
8,10,Responsibility and Redemption,sayheycate,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is much to love about this far-too-short glimpse into the lives of these men and the good work they are doing in this world. I love how they recognize their past wrongs and take responsibility for them, and then turn around and work, every day, in this small quilting shop, away from the tough side of a maximum security prison, creating beautiful gifts for foster kids in whom they see something of themselves. I think they hope to give those kids some hope for their own futures so that those kids, starting out so far behind, don't end up where these inmates currently are. These men, while still struggling with the demons of their former selves, are meticulous and thoughtful about their fabric choices, and the quilt design and block layout, making sure that the corners are clean and there are no puckers, giving these kids the recognition and care that they will never know about and that those kids' families never did in order to atone and pay forward and to heal both themselves and those kids. They are not transformed into perfect humans, but they have been given a purpose and that purpose has made them want to be better members of society. And I think that is beautiful and the best outcome you can hope for.",False
9,10,I only wish is was longer.,rastaizzy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler**Spoilers* This sweet documentary of a group of prisoners (some are lifers) is very touching. Anyone who has gotten into a meditative state crafting, woodworking, painting, motorcycle repair, etc can understand how this can ease even the troubled minds in prison. All quilts go to foster children and other needy groups. How wonderful if this was offered in prisons around the country. They do not mention what each man has done to be in prison and instead focuses on the quilting and how it has been a calming effect. The quilts are intricate and designed with creativity and love. The inmates knowing they are going to kids in foster care really makes them more meanful to reach man. 10 out of 10.",True
10,10,Loved the quilters,connieestridge,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was such a touching documentary, I want more. I want to know more about the men and their lives. I am also a quilter of quilts for charities, and they do a much better job than I do, ha ha. It's such an uplifting show and focuses on the quilting and not on what the men did to get there. Maybe that will be for the next show. Chill was my favorite, he did bad things, but is now trying to redeem himself. Sorry the one inmate had to go back to his regular cell. Maybe he'll get to come back to the quilting group eventually. In the end, it made me cry because it was so touching. Please, more of these men and their work.",True
11,10,Outstanding.,wbewitched,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cannot recommend this enough. Sure, it's about men in prison - many who will spend the rest of their lives there, who make peraonal quilts for foster kids that they will never meet. But what it's really about is how the mistakes we make, even when big, aren't necessarily who we are and don't have to define our lives. None of these men excuse their crimes, and they shouldn't - the overriding sentiment of all of them is, ""I make no excuses"", but they've chosen not to be defined by what they did and to try to do what they can to bring some light to others.On an artistic level (and quilt making IS an art) these men take their craft VERY seriously; and their specialties reflect their strengths (the man who always does butterflies because that is his mom to him). They truly are amazing artisans.In any case, I highly recommend taking 30 minutes of your day to watch this short documentary. My only complaint is I wish it was longer...and I hope Fred was given a second chance and was allowed back.",False
12,10,The Quilters,cindyfrary,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Quilters is a profound and deeply meaningful documentary short that reveals an unexpected and transformative act of grace: men serving life sentences in the rural Southeast who create quilts for at-risk youth. With remarkable sensitivity, the film captures the humanity of incarcerated individuals who are so often rendered invisible, showing how threads of remorse, hope, and compassion can take shape through cloth stitched together with love. Each quilt is a hand-stitched form of redemption. The cinematography is quiet and intimate, allowing the vulnerability of the quilters to be revealed. The reflections of the quilters are raw, honest, and often heartbreaking, offering a powerful counter-narrative to how society views incarceration, especially in forgotten corners of the American South. The Quilters challenge us to see art and empathy where we least expect it. It is a stunning, soul-stirring testament to the possibility of healing, even behind bars.",False
13,9,Would love to see more,politik-69932,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a must watch, easy viewing short documentary which could so easily have become a series.The offenders have found meaning in the work they do and produce quality goods for children in need.The time and effort they put in to what they produce with the simple aim of bringing joy to children is a beautiful story. They take care of each other, coach each other and seem to have created positivity and joy in what at first appears a simple task. I wish I had half of their skill or know where to start.But what this documentary shows is the meaning of rehabilitation. What is possible to see is the joy, honesty and kindness in their hearts which is mirrored in their eyes.I want to see more.",True
14,10,THIS IS AMAZING!!! MORE PLEASE!,niasadero,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is SUCH a beautiful thing they are doing & a wonderful documentary! It should be a SERIES!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 The quilts are breathtaking & extremely unique! This is how you redeem yourself, for sure...by giving back to those who are in need, especially children!! I really like how focused the men are, and that they have their priorities straight. Are they perfect? No, but they are trying to do what they can to brighten a child's day with something that is hand made and one of a kind. Thirty minutes if just not enough time for this type of documentary in my opinion, which is why Netflix should pick this up & make it an ongoing series. I'm sure others feel the same way I do! Love it!!!",False
15,10,Quilters is wonderful!,MegR-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film takes you to a slice of life you would never have thought existed. A group of men in a high security prison find fellowship and purpose through making BEAUTIFUL quilts for foster children. It is very intimate and it is hard not to get attached to the characters and to be awed by their skills, the pride they take in their work and the special, colorful community they have built inside a drab prison. Quilters is one of the most hopeful and inspiring stories I have ever heard. It is fantastic and I recommend it to anyone who likes quilting, anyone who likes stories of redemption and anyone who wants to be uplifted!",False
16,9,"A deeply humanistic documentary, cute and touching.",MehdiTaba,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Quilters is a family-friendly, deeply humanistic documentary that explores the possibility of transformation in even the harshest environments and among those many might consider beyond redemption. It's an emotional, touching, and thought-provoking film that balances sincerity with subtle inspiration.The direction is confident and sensitive, complemented by a strong screenplay, professional production values, and excellent editing. The cinematography is thoughtfully composed, and the film's score and audio design are particularly well-executed, enhancing the emotional weight of the narrative.With its moderate pacing and well-balanced tone-both cool and compassionate-it remains engaging throughout. A unique and moving piece of filmmaking, The Quilters is not just well-made, but also essential viewing. I loved it.8.5/10.",False
17,10,This is what rehab should be about,psuwillbe,n/a,16/08/2025,"The men know what they have done wrong. They grieve their past and wrong doings AND they are so happy and excited to give back to children in need. This is the best example of how to rehabilitate a criminal and how to give back to society. The ""system"" needs to utilize programs such as these more efficiently to help not only the prisoners, but our society.",False
18,10,PLEASE give us more!,wingram-98658,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Quilters is one of the best documentaries I've seen. After working in a jail for 35 years, I can tell you that inmates can be remorseful, regretful, ambitious, eager to please others, and to learn new things. They appreciate being told when they have done something good. They need to feel pride in themselves. I would love to see a program like this in our facility. Everyone needs to feel like they have a purpose in this world, and to have a chance to redeem themselves. As so many have said...please make this a series. We also need updates on the quilters in this program. There is so much negativity around us. We need more examples of people doing good things for a change.",False

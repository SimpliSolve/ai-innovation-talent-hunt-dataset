1,9,Pretty Good,bertorecuerza,n/a,16/08/2025,"At the time of this writing, I know of 4 productions regarding the rescue in Thailand. The others I know of are ""The Rescue"" which is a documentary told mostly from the perspective of the cave divers (due to a trust fund one of the parents et up for the team, there were legal reasons why the kids could not be part of most of the other productions made outside of Thailand) and I think that one is very good too. ""13 Lives"" by Ron Howard follows that one closely. This one is a documentary and it is pretty good and you get the other side of the story from ""The Rescue."" While they do interview the cave divers, the focus is on the 13 who were trapped and what was going on. Things like, ""There was bubbling and we thought we were being rescued...except it was a flash flood and had to run!"" Of the productions know about on the subject, I'd recommend this one and ""The Rescue"" to get the real story from both sides. I have not yet seen 13 Lives, but many say it was excellent and follows ""The Rescue"" closely. The NetFlix series, ""Thai Cave rescue"" is my least favorite. While it is a good show, it has glaring omissions and changes events a little too much once you know the real story.",False
2,10,I cried when the rescue team came and met the kids.,ngoc-82271,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBecause we know the result that the kid had been saved, if we were in the situation in 2018, many people think they couldn't live without food in 10 days, such amazing.When the kids thought, they actually would die, or if any one of them died first, they would eat that body to be alive, is really fact. Can't image they didn't have any food in 10 days, but they can't dig the block in cave try to find their way out, they have a strong power because of thinking about their family. The pressure of coach, he was very scared because he thought he did that mistake, to make kids and their family in that situation.Even though they saved, but I'm still so sad because of the rescue team lost, so sorry about that. Thank Thai Land's government, and many team with their compassion to do this ""impossible mission"", they connect people all around the world, we are one, we have loved, without the barrier, without skin tone, all ready to help each other. Such a very, very meaning documentary.",True
3,10,Well Documented,AlanaDeAgrella,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this, knowing the story, but not really 'knowing'
I had tears in my eyes quite a few times and as a parent I wondered how I would've worried so much not being able to speak to my son or see him knowing he was alive but I couldn't be there for him at that time or hold him when he is scared. The coach was amazing with these boys with the stress he was going through trying to keep the boys and himself 'sane'
I have been in a cave expedition and the stuffiness is hectic.The hunger and darkness let a lone the oxygen been used by 13 people in that space was the last thing I thought of and then the shock of realizing.Sam will always be a hero ... gone but not forgotten as well as Duangphet Phromthep who will also be in the hearts of many.Loved the documentary very much and will
strongly recommend it.",True
4,9,Very good documentary,Lis_G,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though we know the outcome, I watched parts of this through my fingers, barely able to watch, imagining the dire situation for the boys and the immense stress on the rescuers and families. It was good to hear the boys stories and how they pulled together, and for so long. They were very strong. Interesting to hear the thoughts of the rescuers who had to anaesthetise the boys before they were taken out of the cave. Well done to everyone and respect to the gentleman who passed away trying to save the boys. Writing this in 2023 it is also so sad to hear that one of the boys took his life recently. I hope the other boys are doing well.",False

1,1,Annoyingly Boring,shebuddy-64428,n/a,15/08/2025,"Why did I watch the whole thing? This was one of the worst shows Ive ever seen. Not only are the people extremely boring and for the most part, lack any form of personality, nothing happens. Its ok to be boring and normal but not on film. This was horrendously painful to watch. I became upset with myself for wasting the time it took to watch this. And nothing happened. Nothing Nothing Nothing except a couple bangs from the pipes. The only entertaining part and I stress ONLY were the stories from the caretakers and owners of the property. I do not normally comment on movies. I believe ""to each his own"". However, to the cast and crew, Please do not do anything like this again before taking some lessons or classes at the very least. With the exception of the camera and mic people.",False
2,9,Paranormal Investigation Documentary,beckieannvalentine,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary explores unique methods of paranormal investigation and multiple haunted locations. Each location in the ghost town is given the factual history and then the history is compared within the results received during the investigation.These are not actors, they are paranormal investigators who are providing an unscripted look at what happens when calls are received to explore haunted locations.This is not a feature film; it is raw material, unscripted and edited by a production team.These are actual haunted houses and they do not employ lighting fixtures in order to adjust lighting. It is the actual environment to immerse you in what houses with documented paranormal activity are life.Each investigators brings a unique perspective and method but ultimately everything comes to a resolution at the end.If you're looking for a horror film, this is not that. There are clients who are interviewed for the locations and we have to respect them.",False

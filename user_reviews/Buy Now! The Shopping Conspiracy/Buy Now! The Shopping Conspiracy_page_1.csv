1,8,I feel sick...,jenbaldwin4,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like to think I'm a conscientious person when it comes to the environment and consumption, but I feel sick to learn how bad these problems are. The documentary did a great job showing how corporations lie to us and compel us to buy. And it revealed the huge scope of the environmental and health disasters brewing. I took two stars off for the annoying AI and graphics and for leaving the viewer without any real solutions. As a budding minimalist I can see how mindless consumption is contributing to pollution and waste. I just hope I can get my friends and family to watch this documentary. Schools and universities should make it required viewing. We need to get the younger generations thinking about it and help solve this disaster!",False
2,7,Great Info/Bad Presentation,lcbeneke,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's great info in this documentary, but it was presented in a juvenile way. The computer generated voice that leads the viewer from topic to topic, scene to scene, was beyond annoying. By the time it was over, I felt like I had experienced a net loss of intelligence. The presentation was definitely, in my opinion, not directed to my generation (boomer) and maybe that's to be expected. In a movie titled ""Buy Now-The Shopping Conspiracy"", I would have expected to see a segment on influencers and such and was disappointed that the topic was skipped. Lastly, I did come away from the movie with an image in my head of how much useless clothing is in my closet and why it's there... Because it was cheap enough to be easy to buy and throw away/donate when I was done with it. And I think that's the bottom line. I'll try to be better.",False
3,8,A documentary that everyone should watch,vaibhavhyf,n/a,16/08/2025,A very uncomfortable reality check on how businesses work at a macro level.Something that could've been added was how we can make it better (the solutions part was briefly showcased in the end)But it's a must watch for everyone who believes and doing good for the planet and understanding the problem in depth.Highly recommended and a great work by the team who took the leap of faith in putting it together. Kudos to all the business professionals who came out and share the truths about how big companies operate.I hope this serves as a reminder on where are we heading as humanity and what kind of future are we passing on to our future generations.,False
4,6,Delivery is bad,nospam1974,n/a,16/08/2025,The message and the intentions behind this documentary are good. This could have been a much better documentary with more impact had they not added what sounds like an AI voice throughout. The AI voice in combination with the special effects took me out of it. The message and information is something that needs to be out there and people should watch this documentary for that alone but it was a struggle for me to sit through it as the aforementioned choices consistently took me out of the story. I just think they missed the mark with how they delivered the message. But it is definitely a message that many need to hear.,False
5,7,An urgent warning against the crisis of waste,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Buy Now! The Shopping Experience"" (2024 release; 84 min) opens, we get to know Maren Costa, a former Amazon ""used experience designer"" and inventor of the ""one buy click"". She details the enormous amount of science that goes into the Amazon buyer experience leading to super easy and quick (impulse?) purchases. But what happens after all that stuff has been purchased? At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from documentarian Nic Stacey (""Codebreaker""). Here he examines two separate but related issues: the first is how big companies like Amazon, Apple, and Adidas (all featured in the documentary) perfect the art of inducing consumers to buy, buy, buy, and then buy some more. The second is what happens with all of the unwanted or expired products afterwards. IT is the second one that is by far the more urgent issue, and the movie is in that sense a natural companion to ""An Inconvenient Truth"". To give just one example: we learn in this documentary that every day13 million mobile phones get thrown out around the world. Some of the footage in the documentary regarding waste and landfills shocks the conscience.""Buy Now! The Shopping Conspiracy"" recently started streaming on Netflix. Netflix recommended it to me based on my viewing habits. This documentary is currently rated 81% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. If you have any interest in the buying experience and what happens with stuff after that, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
6,10,Be aware of the problem,sofiiadibeo,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's something most of us don't think about - but it could be catastrophic for the future of the planet if we continue to stay ignorant. So, an amazing and very important message of waste all of us can easily apply in our everyday lives. And if enough of us do, it can really change business models because the demand will go down. Maybe you don't really need to buy that thing after all? Or maybe you can buy a used thing in a second hand or charity shop?Highly recommend.The occasional AI voice wasn't a problem for me personally (it's just acting like the ""bad guy""). If it is for you, just skip it and focus on the interviews. Overall, I think the message is super important to get across to the billions of us in the world.",False
7,6,Important information but poorly presented,MadisonLee000,n/a,16/08/2025,"Full disclosure, unless you're in complete denial of the consumption culture of today - not much of the information presented in this film will surprise you. If you've decided to watch it, chances are you will already be aware of some of the information presented. It's such an important and relevant topic, which deserves space for intelligent discussion, so it was disappointing that it was presented in such a cheesy and infantilising way. The female robot voice narrating intermittently throughout was particularly annoying that I almost turned it off - fortunately the parts between were interesting and had value. The interviews with key ex-employees of big corps was compelling enough to hold up on it's own, without the bizarre additions which seemed to serve only to fill airtime, which could have otherwise been used to further the message. It's a shame because we need more of this kind of messaging as mass consumption becomes ever more prevalent, I am just hoping the next effort delivers better.",False
8,10,Must watch!,ajcgeerts,n/a,16/08/2025,"A must watch for everyone. I have worked at online retail platforms and this is 100% how things are done. It's good for this to be public knowledge. The documentary explains it pretty well for non tech people. Especially the UX part. We've just made a machine based on behavior science to get people to buy stuff. You basically get addicted to buying stuff. Precisely as she says: you click and before you think about it if you need it or not,
You already purchased it in 1 click. The persuasive techniques that are used are immersive. Tens of experiments on one website all at the same time. All the time! Combine this with add incomes and retail media and we're trapped in a wold dominated by retail platforms, retail media and product manufacturers. We need to stop this.",False
9,7,A great reminder you don't need all the junk you've got...,mdw0526,n/a,16/08/2025,"The holidays were the perfect time to watch the documentary, ""Buy Now! The Shopping Conspiracy"", which was a timely reminder of the unsustainable consumerism fueling this late stage of capitalism, a system at odds with the health of our planet. This educational and entertaining documentary doesn't break much new ground, but effectively underscores a sobering reality: from floating islands of plastic rubbish in the Pacific to beaches in Ghana choked with discarded fast fashion, our buying habits have dire consequences. While not the most comprehensive take on the issue, its brevity works in its favor, driving home a clear message: we don't need most of the stuff we accumulate. Is it really necessary to rent storage for things we barely use? The new year is a good time to declutter, shop thoughtfully, and embrace small, sustainable changes. If you're looking for a quick dose of inspiration to consume less and live more intentionally, this is worth a watch.",False
10,4,"Message important, delivery awful",ewilcock,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whilst the message this documentary is trying to send is an important one, and one everyone should be aware of, the presentation was just poor. There was no overarching story to keep going back to, just wading from one problem area to another, with pretty bizarre interjections from an AI that try to lighten the mood by jokingly educating you on how to create more waste and exploit consumers. This really takes you out of the serious message that needs to be understood, and feels like it's trying to connect with gen Z audiences way too hard. Can we please stop messing up documentaries about these topics and produce one well so that we can genuinely recommend it to people to open their eyes?",False
11,10,The truth Is hard to swallow,vispateresa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't believe that some people reviewing this documentary focus on the visual and directorial aspects of it, rather than on the powerful, devastating messageBy the way, I like the aestetic chosen, even the mock app, so similar to the ones we use every day.The truth is that most people don't like this documentary because it undermines the very base of Western society, that is, capitalism.The truth is not only devastating, but hard to accept.Our society is based on buying, wasting, polluting. And some people on the other end of the planet will get sick when dealing with our waste, while a few other have shameful multimillionaire profits.This is a real punch in the gut; everybody must see it and try to change the way we consume.",False
12,6,It's not telling me or showing me anything new,lilianaoana,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yeah, we all know Amazon is a monster...
This can only be informative to newbies to consumerist ideology. Or those seriously in denial, but why would they watch this? How would they even come across it? There's about 20 minutes of this that is informative or interesting to me. 20 minutes overall.Otherwise it's relying on some garishly colourful visuals and some basic animation as a gimmick for the narrative approach. That app teaching you how to become rich by increasing sales and wrecking the environment at all costs is pretty cringe, both in the dialogue and the design. I would've preferred straightforward documentary narration with hard-hitting facts.",False
13,5,"Important Messages, Inane Delivery & Denouement",MeadtheMan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though documentaries such as this bemoan the evil of fast fashion, in a way, it's like the fast fashion of documentary?? Let me explain how it's so in three ways.First, the extremely inane graphics, which eclipse any important messages that they wish to convey. Do all Americans have ADHD with extremely short attention span? Why do you have to cut to sensory-overload visuals every few seconds?! Let the commentaries sink in a little. For example, when you throw things away, there's no such a place as an ""away."" Let that sink in, with gravitas, because while it's common sense, that realization hasn't drilled into many people's consciousness. Give it some gravity, instead of desperately trying to entertain the audience at every corner. These are uncomfortable, inconvenient truths, they're supposed to make us uncomfortable! And visuals don't have to serve no purpose or distracting or, worse, makes things less understandable. For example, instead of showing images of garbage flooding some cities in a cheap AI manner, why not translate millions of tons into something easier to comprehend - for example, how much that weight is compared to, say, an elephant? How heavy is the packaging compared to the actual food that we consume, or maybe more importantly, how much energy it takes to produce the food compared to that required to produce and break down the packaging?And the insanely bad computer-generated narrator? Give me an effing break. So cliché and this isn't even an AI-gone-bad documentary.The second problem is, while the documentary correctly points out that one of the greenwashing methods is to make you believe that consumers are the problem and consumers alone can save the world, some of its concluding messages are contradictory: telling consumers, yes you should have the right to fix your phone, use this paper lid instead of a plastic one, hey look at this totally recyclable shoe, yada yada. Those are important, but unless there's a seismic change in how corporations work and the governments regulate, how we should move away from fossil fuel asap, and how we should consume LESS, of anything, period, things might not move in a way significant enough to prevent a total climate change catastrophe. Maybe, better still, reevaluate our relationships with things, and how much better if that sweet relationship is applied to other human beings instead.The last problem, as alluded to earlier, is the lack of gravity. Despite the grave challenges suggested in the documentary, there's still an attempt to paint unicorns over things. While we shouldn't be nihilistic, and it's ok to end on an optimistic note, there should be moments in the doc where you really, really emphasize how BIG of a problem this obsession with buying and selling is. Otherwise, the takeaway for some will just be like ""oh, will just try a little harder next time, no big deal."" It. Is. A. Big. Deal.",False
14,6,"Amazon, you have 1 month to respond.",SD97,n/a,16/08/2025,"This started off as a expose on how big industries maximise profits but 70% of it is just a lecture on waste and waste managements. Very little ""conspiracy"" as the title suggests. By the end, it was just Netflix vs Amazon, we know why.Also the whole AI experience was a swing and a miss. Did not enjoy that at all. The random funny videos in the middle was not a ""genius"" move. Could have added more information instead of the AI bit.Overall, this tells nothing new, we already know how big corps work. They didn't expose anything. I am disappointed. They were basically like ""go green, go green"".Ugh, this had a lot of potential but in the end, all the big corpos are the same. Even Netflix. 6/10.",False
15,7,Good but not great,hkgxukw,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes there is a consumption crisis. Yes corporations should hold themselves to a higher ethical standard. Yes it's admirable when people who participate in the exploitation of humanity, walk away and speak their truths. Yes we are pleased there is a top 10 documentary on a major streaming platform addressing sad facts of the matter. No we did not like sasha. No we did not find the lightbulb story relevant considering everything is LED now. No we did not appreciate the flashing lights. This 1 and done short doc is great for elementary aged children and maybe a few grown adults who are still oblivious. Not sure why there was only a few corporations mentioned over and over. Apple products still last on average about 5 years before you either trade up or sell. I have never thrown out an apple product and the landfill shots showed non apple products. An average microsoft products lasts maybe 2 years if your lucky and there is no resale or trade in value on them. I would have liked to see more on Shein and H&M. I wanted to hear more about the sports products. If your going to do a documentary like this at least provide a well needed 10 part series. The waste investigation was really cool and that alone would be a great ongoing series to watch. More needed to be said about the origin of the products when made and the environmental devastation upon inception of a product and the shipments of product. Nothing on electric cars and batteries? All around a decent watch but took forever to get to the point. I almost stopped watching after 5 minutes and kept waiting for the ""ah-ha!"" moment but it never transpired. Well deserved 7.",False
16,10,"Every time I throw ""away"" our trash...",paulo9,n/a,16/08/2025,"I grew up buying sodas in glass bottles and I remember clearly that not one corner store would sell you any glass bottle soda unless you had an empty glass bottle to exchange. It had to be from the same brand you were wanting to buy!!! Then the government allowed sodas to be sold in non-returnable plastic containers and ever since nothing was the same anymore. The convenience has been amazing but now, 38 years later, the amount of plastic and e-waste that we have is impacting all of us, regardless of where we live. Obviously, 1st world countries have less of an impact but eventually we are all going to be impacted by it. Why are we degrading our environment and our health? Because we believe that having lots of money is the path to liberation. Well, most people in our planet believe this to be the case. It's another epic lie!!! And now, here in the greatest country in our world right now (military wise), in the magnificent United States of America, all of our governmental institutions are going to be led by corporate greedy people. What could go wrong? Epic bribes, deregulations, contracts of all kinds, given to the highest bidders. In the meantime, our beautiful world is desperately trying to get rid of us, one calamity after another. At this moment in time we are nothing more than mere parasites destroying our own planet. This is how I feel every time I throw ""away"" our trash every week :/",False
17,6,"Before buying Ask yourself 10 times , do you really need this?",reviewforeveryone,n/a,16/08/2025,"I personally do not buy anything from big brands like Nike, Adidas, Gucci, or Prada. My reason is their exploitative capitalism, as they overprice their products while often exploiting resources and labor. I prefer to support local stores rather than big brands. But it is my personal choice & opinion.Buy Now The Shopping Conspiracy is a 2024 Netflix documentary Directed by Nic Stacey.Documentary that exposes the manipulative tactics of consumerism, from planned obsolescence to wasteful marketing strategies. The film explores topics like planned obsolescence, corporate waste, and marketing tactics that drive overconsumption.it uses a satirical tone to highlight how corporate practices and unchecked consumption contribute to environmental degradation. The film With a mix of insider interviews, archival footage and AI-generated visuals to emphasize the gravity of consumer-driven waste .While the documentary's message about the need to rethink consumption habits is powerful, execution was poor such as AI narrator and especially graphics it was not required. This documentary could be more powerful & impact full without those colourful graphicsHowever, It challenges viewers to question their purchasing habits and the hidden costs of ""fast"" products, from electronics to fashion. How we are over consuming buying even if we don't need it we just order , we are being influenced by social media influencer buy something which even not required or feeling Fear of missing out.So next time before you buy something especially online Ask yourself 10 times , do you really need this ?",False
18,10,Strong and Powerful Message,bive,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the most visible consequences of consumerism is its devastating impact on the environment. The demand for mass production of goods leads to the excessive exploitation of natural resources, deforestation, and habitat destruction. For instance, industries extract non-renewable resources at an unsustainable rate to meet consumer demands, causing irreversible damage to ecosystems. Furthermore, the production and transportation of goods generate massive amounts of carbon emissions, contributing to climate change.While the challenges posed by consumerism are daunting, solutions do exist. Educating individuals about the environmental and social costs of overconsumption is a critical step. Promoting sustainable consumption practices, such as buying fewer but higher-quality products, supporting local businesses, and embracing minimalism, can reduce the demand for mass-produced goods. Governments and corporations also have a responsibility to implement policies that encourage sustainability, such as stricter regulations on waste management, incentives for green businesses, and support for fair trade practices.",False
19,n/a,"Overproduced, Flashy and Terrible.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGone are the days where a documentary consists of interviews with subject matter experts to discuss a certain topic.What we got here instead is a very flashy, overproduced documentary that shows short interviews of very insightful people, separated by long, cringy A. I produced segways that makes you want to shut down Netflix. I swear if the producers just compiled those interviews in their raw format, it would have been much more interesting.It seems that the producers had a giant budget for this movie, that they didn't know what to do with, so, instead of creating a very detailed investigative documentary that shows important insights about large corporations, they wasted the money doing very questionable close-up shots of their subjects, long scenes of waste being generated from every corner of the earth, very strange camera work, unnecessary lighting and lots of scenes made with A. I.The interviews were the best parts of the movie. It shows former Amazon designer, former Adidas executive, former Apple engineer, and lots of important people talking about their experience working for big corporations and how they were led to believe they were making a difference until they took a moment to realize that they are causing so much damage to this world.The premise is very simple, bring those people and interview them, and share their insights with the world. Unfortunately, between each interview, there's a cringy scene of an A. I voiced subject, talking about how those corporations think or behave. Those scenes were completely unnecessary and very difficult to get through. Each one of them was over-produced as it's a sci-fi movie with a million-dollar budget. The narrative that the A. I read makes no sense and adds no value to the movie. There's literally a scene almost at the end where a shoe is talking to the screen. Its so cringy and unnecessary, I question how people saw it and thought it was okay to make.Besides the interviews themselves, the movie offers absolutely nothing. The writers or producers didn't contribute to the film whatsoever even though, there were many opportunities to contribute. For example, when the waste investigator tracks down those LCD screens from Germany to Belgium and then Thailand, instead of showing footage of the dump site, the producers could have interviewed the workers working in that site, to ask them how much they make, how many hours they are working, what illnesses do they have, but the movie does nothing additional besides showing those interviews. Similar, the movie shows sweatshops in Asia for the fast fashion industry, the movie could have shown interviews with those people and shown how they live, or their working conditions, but nothing.At the end, this movie is a failure. It failed to make an impact, it failed to resonate with the audience, and the sole purpose of it was to show camera work and flashy A. I scenes. The director has a better chance making a sci-fi movie than a documentary.",True
20,7,Whoever ends up with the most stuff does not win,quinntrangluong,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a world where consumerism is encouraged as a means to fill the void within, people need to open their eyes to the impact consumerism has on the environment. To be fair, we all know its impact conceptually, but the documentary shows a concrete reality of the current state of the world.As an environmentally conscious person and also an Amazon prime member, I had to face the cognitive dissonance on my consumption habits. While I believe the responsibility to fix climate change issues lies largely on corporations, individual consumers can be as conscious as they can while making choices.This documentary is a good reminder to buy less, keep things for longer, and quality over quantity. Direct your resources to experiences, which is actually more fulfilling to the human soul anyways.",False
21,5,"""Buy Now! The Shopping Conspiracy"" spells it out: were suckers.",GreenmanReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Buy Now! The Shopping Conspiracy"" spells it out: were suckers. Corporations know it and they have perfected the art of dangling shiny new things to keep us hooked. All to Maximize their profits.The documentary does a good job of calling out how companies manipulate us into thinking we need to buy more all the while pretending they are doing us a favor. The whole Sasha? Obvious AI voice host thing was equaly amusing and creepy but its very relevant these days. I have heard a lot of AI voices in commercials lately, for some of them i didnt even realize they were AI untill i checked.That fake promise of a surprise at the end? I fell for it. Its a Mystery box and people love a good Mystery Box right?! But thats the point they made us feel the same way we do when a sale tricks us into buying junk we dont need.Overall its a solid watch with some cool shots&visuals that might make you pause before hitting add to cart.

The blatant lies and very questionable business practices that are brought to light are infuriating. If you come away from this documentary unaffected, you're really not paying attention. I feel this is a program everyone should watch, which should really cause them to pause and come to the realization that we consumers are being...the best word here is...used. The waste, the dishonesty, the lying, the absolutely complete disregard for the environment, all for profit.

24,5,"Good message, too much filler and no suggested answers",ta-60644,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is probably 45 minutes of good material here and the rest is filler. The format with the Ai style voice throughout so much of it is annoying.The annoying Ai filler could have been replaced with spending a lot more time on how marketing changed our buying habits from buying to replace worn out items to buying because we want to be like someone else, because of FOMO, because it is today's in thing.They showed the 'influencers' but didn't really address their affect on people's buying habits. While, in reality, influencers are a massive part of the buying things we really don't need problem.They put the blame only on the corporations, not the influencers and especially not us, the customers.They didn't address the fact that, for a large part, our economy is supported by this kind of wasteful shopping. If people went back to buying a new pair of shoes only when their old ones wore out and buying clothes that lasted for years instead of weeks, it would be a terrible hit on our economy.If we shifted back to ""I'd like to have that someday"" from the current ""I must have that right now!"" thinking about buying, it would hit a lot of companies quite hard.Back when people shopped more out of necessity than want, much more of the items were manufactured here. That process supported multiple levels of jobs that don't exist with nearly everything being imported now. The economy could survive with less buying when people here were getting paid on every step from raw material to finished product.Now the items just show up at the port and we get paid to sell them. And with the latest shopping sites even that step is being removed and they are going directly from the foreign factory to the US consumer.The food waste is terrible, however how is a bagel shop supposed to figure out the logistics of getting old bagels to someone that could benefit from them? Are food banks willing to take old food like that?In fact, the show made no real suggestions as to how any of the problems could be corrected, other than for companies to stop advertising things to us so well.",False

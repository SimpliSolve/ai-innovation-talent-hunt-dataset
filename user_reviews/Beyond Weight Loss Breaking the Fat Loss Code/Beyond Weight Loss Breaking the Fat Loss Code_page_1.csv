1,8,"Some great advice, but ...",swoondrones,n/a,16/08/2025,"... I do not know where there is info on high carbs. I get to keep fat reasonably low, but what about carbs?Anyway, I eat good stuff. Aiming for OMAD.About the money problem that influences govt:
No empowered political or social change will happen until economic reforms are made, and that won't happen until we leave usury commodity currencies behind and move to qualitative exchange mechanisms with no cost that incentives status to create sustainably. This means a no-cost, non-commodity exchange model that doesn't need fractional reserve lending or usury to run it.",False
2,9,Genuinely Good Advice!,heratyplant,n/a,16/08/2025,"Doesn't start well, with some poor presentation, dubious digital effects & lame stock video footage throughout; also I nearly turned off when one of the 'experts' was being introduced, as it started to look like an infomercial for him, but hang in there!Although much of this is common sense advice, sometimes you need to be reminded & this the film does well, as the experts give no nonsense, easy to remember tips on diet & exercise. There's also some things you may not know about general nutrition, eating & fitness that are all very interesting & helpful.There were quite a few fundamental things I've been doing wrong & that I will take away from the film, so thanks for the guidance - 5 to 6 balanced, 300 calorie meals per day!!My advice to the film makers, next time, employ a more up to date editor with a better visual taste level.",False
3,10,Amazing what the labels aren't saying,amymiller-38243,n/a,16/08/2025,I felt like it might be an informercial but I Stuck it out. Keith really helped me understand how to figure out how much fat is in the food I eat. I have been following the 5 meals a day plan and reading labels and have alright lost 8lbs and I feel great!! I threw out a d stopped buying certain food because I thought they were healthy and yet they were so bad for me,False
4,1,Limited useful information,nepgarciaphotography,n/a,16/08/2025,"I liked the ""labels"" explanation part because everyone should know how to read their food labels.After that they go on a rampage criticizing this diet and that diet without offering a solution to the problem.A ""doctor"" even said she thinks it's really stupid way of living if you avoid those chips and salsa with your friends or fried rice and beans at the Mexican restaurant because you eventually will fail at your diet.When your life depends on it you won't. Because I rather avoid deep fried corn chips in exchange for a healthier me in the future.Any ""expert"" can criticize whatever diet at any time they want but the bigger problem is that nobody educates/explains people what's going to happen in the future if they keep consuming highly processed foods and sugary drinks and high carb foods.What happens to the blood, the liver, the brain, the kidneys, the eyes and everything that you are internally?Anybody can say; That doesn't work, you will fail and gain more weight later on. But where's the information that is supposed to make you do more conscious decisions about what you consume?",False
5,10,Shame the KETO people are really marking this down it's a very useful documentary,sharrisononline,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seems like if you say anything which remotely says the not cutting out out carbs is fine and you can still lose weight and they KETO people mobilise to attack you.Not that there's anything wrong as such with KETO , it does help people keep on track by nearly cuttring out carbs but the documentary presents a ton of data to show it's just not required. Life doesn't need to be all about protein and fats , veggies, fruits and well selected carbs can be in any good diet, there's no need to cut out such a lot of foods if the way you eat carbs and the type of carbs you eat is right.The documentary has a number of experts in their fields who present at times some basic but important info that allows people to eat well, eatr a variety of foods, stay healthy, and still lose weight like crazy. Klein for example has had a clinic in houston where they have helped thousands of people get in shape. The female dietician I forget her name, the same.It's just a really good reminder that a balanced diet with a few tweaks and proper timing and food selection can mean a normal life without cutting out a lot of food is possible and also sustainable.A really good piece that focusses on making sure people adopt healthy long term eating habits. I also like the fact they focus on food not drugs, diet pills and supplements etc.Shame people are marking it down because they hate the idea of KETO being talked about negatively in anyway.",False

7,9,9 stars for being out there but minus 1 star for some inaccuracies,OneAnjel,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who has studied nutrition for many years, it's hard for me to grasp the lack of knowledge in our society. I think because of this, I found this film to be quite elementary. However, it has a lot of good information for those who may be still under a rock or who tend to believe the many articles, media hype, or social media success stories. As Jillian Michael has pointed out, yes, you can lose weight on Keto but it's a dangerous diet. This film tells you why it's dangerous more clearly than even our favorite fitness guru. But it's important to also understand they are focusing on a pie-in-the-sky solution here, just like most articles or diets that will warn you that if you don't follow directions it may not work. This film tells us we should ""do"" this or that. But for most people the real question is ""how"". How do I DO that. And Why can't I follow my goals. This is missing here, just like in most well-meaning articles and films. Why we are having so much craving and loss of self-control is about how our food is being made. I thought this film was going to focus on how to select our food better, and it did this to some degree. But the biggest reasons we are unable to say No to over eating is 1. Our food is denatured; any processed food has zero nutritional value. So no matter how much that cereal or yogurt tells you it's good for you, that's not possible because the act of processing destroys the food. 2. because we are consuming denatured food, we are literally starving and our body keeps telling us to eat more. We also have cravings for fat and sugars not only because we're designed to hoard these from cave man days but because the more denature food we eat, the more toxins our body has to hold away from our organs -- this is what creates fat cells. The more often you eat, the less opportunity the body has to digest and process the food you've already consumed. So while eating 5 - 6 meals a day may help short-term, you must give your body a break from the constant
metabolizing because as long as it's processing your food it can't clean out anything and must continue to store toxins. While weight-lifting is super important (body weight also counts for this), running, jumping and other cardio is also important to help loosen the fat surrounding your organs as you lose weight and detox. When they talk about avoiding ""carbs"" in some of the most popular diets, they are referring to the bad carbs; but good carbs are essential and can help you detox and feel better faster (good carbs are any raw fruits and vegs, keeping in mind cruciferous vegs and spinach are enzyme inhibitors and should be avoided; and keeping in mind that roots are not in that category since they can not be eaten raw. I felt this film was inaccurate in some ways because while there are many important points everyone should know, they focused too much on this several-meals-a-day theory, which is not really in anyone's best interest. The most important things are: no more than 500 calories in one sitting; no more than the calories allowed by your BMR; and minimize processed foods (and remove all animal products when you're ready since that is the number one cause of acidic blood and, eventually, cancer. And ideally, follow the 80/10/10 rule (please look this up). 20% is still too high. But if you must eat something with processed sugar, you can minimize the impact on your pancreas by making sure that item has a similar amount of protein and a low amount of fat. Fat is the true culprit of diabetes because it's what inhibits the sugar from being processed through your system. This is why healing centers around the world will let you have all the fruit you want but only a few slices of avocado per week and a handful of nuts even less often. As for those criticizing how the video was created, I think just that is was created is a big plus, it will help a lot of people realize many of their mistakes including how to read labeling. The best way to know what your calories and nutrients are is to only eat whole foods that are not processed or pre-made because every ounce of chicken has the same nutrients; every apple has the same nutrients with just a small variation depending on size and ripeness.

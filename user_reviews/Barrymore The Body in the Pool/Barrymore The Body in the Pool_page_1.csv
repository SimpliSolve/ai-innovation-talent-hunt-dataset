1,8,A tale without atonement,paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"This sad documentrary reminds us of a horrible story: Stuart Lubbock was, in all porbability, raped and murdered in the home of entertainer Michael Barrymore; and no-one has ever been held to account, let alone apologised. Rather like Jeremy Thorpe, Barrymore is someone who might have been better off serving time rather than living a life of legal innocence but public guilt. The film also reminds us of the sheer evil of the mentatilty of the popular press, whose members on several occasions basically justify their actions by saying ""it was going to make us money, what else where we going to do?"" That people are less obviously hounded just for being gay is one huge step for the good that has happened in my life; but none of this, of course, has direct bearing on the tragic fate of Lubbock.",False
2,5,"One fathers fight for justice for his son, while no one who knows Talks",allanmichael30,n/a,15/08/2025,"The lack of real ((""honest"")) account of what happened on that night, and the crime scene not being ((lock-down)) has failed both the victim (Stuart) and the accused (BARRYMORE) on the night and years that have followed and more than three contradicting autopsies have led a failed trial. The people that were at the party could have been 1-100 or just 1-5 but police have failed talked to all of them and more than one has cashed in making deals over Â£10,000 plus for what happened without telling the truth and the press. I am surprised that Barrymore still wants to be famous, but i guess he believes that he played no part in the death. I always wanted Michael back on t.v but him not showing remorse for what has happened is quite sad and talking to the dead mans father smiling made him look crazy. I think that the truth will come out someday, but i think the victims father may not see justice in his lifetime as police take so long.",False

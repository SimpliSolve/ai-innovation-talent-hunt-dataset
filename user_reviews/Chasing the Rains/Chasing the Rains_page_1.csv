1,2,"Script, narration for toddlers; repeat scenes from past BBC & NG series",cgtam,n/a,16/08/2025,"Boring preschool script & slow annunciation by narrator- she's talking to 3 yr old viewer with uninteresting voice. Life is easy & fun in wild- nothing bad happens, no ppl destroying habitats or poaching, shooting them in game parks, setting indiscriminate traps. No ppl polluting or eating all African wildlife as cheap ""bush meat ."" No regular current 2 yr droughts due to climate change nor life saving Okavango river & Victoria falls literally drying up due to ppl making countless farming wells and dams drastically reducing water to nil.Good if one wants to cure insomnia or see simplified fairy tale version of African nature. Some of animals shown have already died, film clips are so old.Lies to the youngest generation who must live entire lives with tragic consequences of climate change & mass Ice Age extinction event all occurring now in 2022, the yr this false film was compiled, will NOT improve things globally.Lies to kids just accelerate humanity losing its once Garden of Eden home. SKIP THIS.",False

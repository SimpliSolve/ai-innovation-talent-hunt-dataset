1,8,Love is everything,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - hopefully love lives with you too. And this is about Billy Porter and other individuals you may not have heard of (or maybe it is just me). I had no idea what this would be since I only read the title before I streamed it - was free on the platform I subscribe too. If you are not a fan of Billy, the documentary may not be up your alley.Just be aware what you are about to watch, before you do exactly that and that are dissapointed. There is a lot more to Billy - and I think there is a better documentary just about him that could ... well actually should exist. I reckon it will happen sometime in the future. Until then, you have this here, to understand him and how it was not so long ago to be who he is, in a society who did not seem to care about him ... not very much has changed, but he can be public now ... which is a step in the right direction for sure.",False

1,8,"ABBA, One Of The Greatest Singing Groups In The World.",paulscudder,n/a,16/08/2025,"ABBA > Watched>Thursday, 14th November, 2024 @ Edge Water Studios. Rated 4 * * * * Very Good. Documentary shows archive footage of them, the many interviews, the many songs, concerts, all so fascinating, even if you are a big fan, or not. I would find it very hard to find anyone who wouldn't like ABBA. This 50 minute documentary of this world wide super group, one of the very best in the world, is just a great watch, despite the sound quality at times with the interviews, which is expected, being over 40 years old. ABBA, formed in 1972, followed two years later, with their first major hit with WATERLOO (Released> Tuesday, 12th March, 1974), the winner of the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest, which led to their first of nine number one's in the UK. The following eight number one's were > MAMA MIA (Released> September 1975), FERNANDO (Released> March 1976), and was ABBA's biggest world hit, covering 13 countries and selling over Â£10 million. Then it was DANCING QUEEN (Released> Monday, 16th August, 1976 - on my 20th birthday, which a year later 1977, on my 21st birthday, was the death of ELVIS PRESLEY, Tuesday, 16th August, 1977 - he was only 42 years of age), sorry for drifting away from ABBA. Their following number one's of the nine were KNOWING ME, KNOWING YOU (Released> Monday, 11th October, 1976), THE NAME OF THE GAME (Released in 1977), TAKE A CHANCE ON ME (Released> Monday, 12th December, 1977), THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL (Released> Saturday, 21st July, 1980}, Finally the last of ABBA's nine number one's was SUPER TROOPER (Released> Monday, 3rd November, 1980). Unfortunately MONEY, MONEY, MONEY (Released> Monday, 11th October, 1976) which was another great song, finished 3rd in the UK charts, and could have been ABBA's 10th out 10 of number one's. DANCING QUEEN was their only number one in the USA. MAMA MIA itself, made more money than everything else ABBA released. And that is why they are one of the very best in the world. (ps)",False

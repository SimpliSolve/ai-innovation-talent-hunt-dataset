1,7,Adequate Doc for the Halloween Season,kbtoys100,n/a,16/08/2025,"Without a doubt, the most infamous haunted house in the world is 112 Ocean Avenue. 'The Amityville Horror'Over the years, we've had dozens of books, documentaries and fiction films on the houses supposed hauntings which increasingly stray away from the original story.Now tubi has thrown their hat in the ring with this documentary.Featured within are a few notables, including original haunting reporter Laura Didio, investigator and author of several Amityville books Hans Holzer's daughter, and a village resident who was there at the time. Also included are archival interviews with the Lutz's, Holzer himself, Jay Anson and others.We also get a baffling amount of paranormal podcasters offering their opinions, and, most frustratingly, each section of the doc starts with a tiktok video of either someone shakily filming the Amityville house, or one of those ""top 5"" videos telling the story.I can only imagine these were included as a way to appeal to the younger audience, but they are just so out of place compared to the rest of the professionally done doc and do nothing whatsoever to forward the story.Famously Haunted: Amityville is not going to break any new ground on the subject. It does lean heavily on the haunted side, and glosses over most of the hoax possibilities until the very end. It stands better than My Amityville Horror, but the old history channel two-part documentary still stands as the best on the Amityville story. Still, if you're looking for something spooky to put on for the Halloween season, you could do a lot worse considering it's free on Tubi.",False
2,5,"Ok Documentary, Not Fantastic",thalassafischer,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you have seen one of the main films (the 1979 version or the 2005 version) and/or read the ""biographical"" novel from 1970s this might interest you. It does bring together some elements that can't be found from what would be considered original sources. For example there are new personal accounts from real neighbors and alleged psychics who have a direct connection to the actual house.On the other hand, it keeps flashing the same photos on the screen over and over again, and has tacky details like the interviews with Ric Osuna - a weirdly misogynistic and fan boi-ish biographer who chose to blame one of the victims, the oldest sister Dawn, for Ronnie's murders. Everyone knows his version(s) are completely fanciful lies, not least of all because Dawn was found in bed just like all of the other family members; there's no evidence of this musical bodies fiction where Ronnie agreed to kill the parents but killed Dawn because she allegedly assassinated the children.The history of this topic is pretty gross, all things considered. There are dozens of low-budget schlocky flicks that mock the very real tragedy that happened in 1974, which in my opinion is disturbing enough on its own.",False
3,6,Nice recap of what you probably already know,thomasellery,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's nothing amazing or unique here, but if you're a fan of the Amityville legend, then it makes a harmless little watch.It's one of those tv style documentaries that loves to recap, so you can nip off to the kitchen and grab a snack and not really miss anything.It delves just deep enough into each aspect to keep it moving along without dragging to much over one section. The actual events and phenomena surrounding it make it pretty easy to keep it interesting.I get the TikTok cross over was to highlight the generational interest, but they didn't blend that well, a small montage would have done.There's a nice amount of archive footage, maybe a bit to intrusive modern footage and a good variety of vox poppers, so overall it does what it's supposed to do and mildly entertain with a recap of a story you probably already know.",False
4,4,Nothing new.,Commander_Sani_Ceto,n/a,16/08/2025,Not much new here. The Tik-Tok stuff was very out of place and detracted from the overall vibe of the story. There are other Amityville docs available that are more interesting.,False
5,3,The first 30 minutes were good with facts,krupps-23480,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe first 30 minutes were good. No actual experts just so called physic experts. The priest claims he had a stigmata on his hands, he needs to go to confession and claiming that.The lutz family admitted it was a complete hoax. None of it was true and why do all the so-called experts talk about a fake experience that never happened.I watched an hour and couldn't take the bs anymore.",True
6,2,Hocus Pocus Nothing More,chad-61313,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou won't find anything new in this Doc that hasn't already been presented and debunked. The Lutz family made big $$$ on their story... on the backs of 6 dead souls nonetheless.It's amazing how the Lutz family was the only family that claimed paranormal activity in that house, ""the portal to Hell,"" as some have called it. Numerous families resided in that house before and after the Lutz family and all of them never had a problem.I'm a big fan of the Warren's, but there's more to them than what you see from Hollywood. And sorry to say, Mrs. Warren got it wrong this time. You have a house, with a story, that's spreading world wide. It was the perfect opportunity for them, and they took it. Who wouldn't?As far as the priest who was chased out of the house by a demon is concerned - he comes forward how many years later? And then, even better, states that afterwards his hands blistered from being in that house - but doesn't take a picture for evidence? Seriously? You just had a paradigm shifting event materialize and you take no action? Believe me, as most of you already know, people, including priests, act differently when the cameras are on and there's $$$ involved.I can go on and on about this case, but it's been resolved for years. Oh, and that red room in the basement, from the pics I've seen, it was just a small storage space under the basement stairs... so, take it as you will. 2021, now 7 souls gone and ppl still trying to make a name and $$$ for themselves. Geez, find a new story and really do the research, and I mean deep down 2 pots of coffee research; instead of something that's already been said and done.Without any new information regarding this case, to me, this Doc is just a bunch of ppl sitting around and speculating and what - if'ing - all they're missing is a bonfire and some cold beers.",True
7,10,New voices are a plus,beckieannvalentine,n/a,16/08/2025,I think it's important to acknowledge and consider new voices in the paranormal and true crime fields as they are the future. I am grateful for Famously Haunted: Amityville doing just that. They balanced the introduction of new folks with voices that were keystones in establishing this case many years prior. It does a pretty good job being fair and weighing both angles rather than taking one side and sensationalizing it for views. Although it doesn't contain new information it does weigh both sides fairly and is respectful to those whose opinions differ. It also dissects the work of some of the original researchers.,False
8,3,Nothing new.,donkey_dick,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis film is only recommended for people who know nothing about the case. Amazing how these lame annoying attention seeking gen Zer's podcasters and ticktockers made into this doc as they obviously know very little about the case and made fools of themselves and shouldn't have been included in this doc. Especially that stupid tiktock girl. You are not original. People have been doing what you're doing for years and they're much better at it then you. There's a wealth of information and books written on this case. If you already know the case and aren't a dumbass millennial or gen zer seeking attention then there is nothing new hear and you won't learn anything from it.,True
9,4,Not Nearly as Detailed as It Should Have Been,Uriah43,n/a,16/08/2025,"As most viewers are probably aware, on November 13, 1974, a troubled young man by the name of Ronald DeFeo Jr. Grabbed a shotgun in his house and killed both of his parents and 4 of his siblings in the middle of the night while they slept in their beds The story then picks up a year later with a married couple by the name of George & Kathy Lutz moving into the house with their three children. Slightly less than a month later, they hurriedly abandoned the house in the middle of the night due to what they described as an evil presence which had been tormenting them since the very first day. At least, that is what they maintained in a book published about two years after that--and that is when the mystique actually begins with countless movies being released to capitalize on it. Likewise, there have also been a couple of documentaries produced on this subject, with one released in 2005 under the title of ""The Real Amityville Horror"" being more detailed than this particular version. At least, that is my opinion. That being the case, while I don't consider this to be a terribly bad documentary necessarily, I don't believe it was nearly as effective as its 2005 predecessor, and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",False
10,8,Extremely Informative,diondolcecopley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Coming from someone who is used to seeing only ""haunted"" supernatural perspectives on this house, this one takes the cake. Pleasantly surprised by the depth of the information, congrats Tubi tv.Makes complete sense from a supernatural point -inside jokeWell I have nothing more to add, just taking up space for this rediculous characters limit. I don't want to give any further spoilers and anymore input as I'd like to go back to getting stoned now and enjoying the rest of this documentary from Tubi tv, that was T U B I like the app and T V like that thing on the wall with all the moving pictures. PCE.",False
11,8,Unexpectedly Balanced,nikkijohnson-82861,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have to say, most things like this tend to lean heavily in one direction or the other, but this was a well-balanced presentation. The ""experts"" were level-headed and respected the beliefs of others, acknowledging areas where they could be wrong or interpreting things differently. I could live without the effort to reel in the TikTok crowd, but maybe that's just me showing my age. As the meme says, I watch TikToks as IG reels two weeks later like a grownup... Otherwise, I rather enjoyed it.",False

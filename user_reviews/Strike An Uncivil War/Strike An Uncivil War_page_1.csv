1,8,A very well made documentary.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Why were the miner's strikes of 1984 and 1985 so divisive, so violent, why did a generation of voters despise and loathe The Tory party, and why did friends and families fall apart.This very well made and interesting documentary goes some way to answering some of those questions, but sadly not all of them.I don't get how this one passed me by, was it poorly advertised, or was the subject material just not enough for people?Fascinating first hand evidence from miners up and down the country. Great use of stock footage, but if you're educated on events, you'll see how much was omitted, some of the scenes were truly staggering, violence of the highest order, perhaps they wanted to make this suitable for all?It focuses, perhaps quite rightly on the miners, and its affect on them and their families, it just lacks a bit of content on the political side of things, what was going on behind the scenes.I don't want to get too political, but I'd say the way they depicted both Thatcher and Scargill was interesting to say the least.There was one particularly fascinating piece of info given, the chap that talked about 21 houses on his street, and all 21 houses being supported by people working in the mines.Anyone that doesn't know these events should definitely check if out, it's a turbulent, but very interesting piece of history.8/10.",False
2,7,Keeping it safely away from politics,rebeccat-37865,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was pleased but surprised to find this unheralded documentary showing at my local Vue multiplex and attended a screening that attracted one other viewer. There have been several recent, quite unsympathetic docs on the strike so I was curious as to how this one would treat it.The perspective is from miners themselves rather than from their former leaders or from commentators, apart from one BBC reporters at the time and a former policeman. That helps ground it into a working-class context, but I was less happy to be denied the necessary political context: where was the Labour party in this? It does mention the TUC's total lack of support but strangely portrays Scargill as no more than a rabble-rouser, out of his depth and outmanoeuvred by canny Conservative operators like Thatcher.The coverage of the Orgreave battle between miners in a field near the coking plant and many thousands of uniformed police doesn't reveal anything new. The lack of serious injuries makes it appear more like a slightly riotous festival, certainly compared to the Marikana massacre in South Africa in 2012 in which 34 miners were murdered by the police.In general, the film lacked a serious political analysis. But its presentation of the deep solidarity in mining communities, and how that was purposely destroyed by the Conservative government with the connivance of a right-wing Labour 'opposition', showed how much we have lost.",False
3,9,Needed to be told,legendste,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ignore the Tory on here saying ""subjective rubbish"". Sometimes things don't need a subjective view - calling hard working honest communities ""the enemy within"" is despicable. More people like these lads and this country might actually have something about it again.This is well made and long overdue. One of my favourite movies is Brassed Off which is very much parallel to some of this. Working class people keep this bloody place going and those that believe they're above them and see them as people not to be taken seriously need bringing back down to earth. We waste too much money here on nonsense, talentless reality celebrities and characterless footballers.",False
4,9,Still waiting for answers,djftdxdf,n/a,15/08/2025,"Couldn't help but compare this documentary to modern Britain. Forty years on and it's seems the government are using the same formula that Margaret Thatcher used all those years ago.The documentary is told by the miners who are still waiting for answers. I found it incredibly raw and quite harrowing at times. Hearing how communities were ripped apart and how families lives have never been the same since made it difficult to watch at times.The documentary made me think that the agenda back then is very, very similar to what's happening in our country now. The government Vs the working class.",False
5,8,"Great documentary about the ""battle"" that fails to get to grips with why the miners' lost",swpmre,n/a,15/08/2025,"Pleased to be able to see this on the big screen, but sadly only four others were there to see what is an important study of the most significant struggle of 20th century Britain.The film is excellent in its documentary coverage of the Battle of Orgreave, the connivance between the Thatcher government and the British state's forces, and how this was covered up. There is moving testimony by strikers. However the interviews with cops and scabs also help show how the miners were broken.But the real problem is that the film depicts the strike's defeat as simply being because of the violent defeat of the miners at Orgreave. While important, the real reason for the loss was the failure of the wider union movement to deliver significant and sustained solidarity strike action. The video of the lorries leaving Orgreave with coke for the steel plants should have explained that the drivers' unions failed to call them out.I was also disappointed that there wasn't more about how the wider working class sustained the communities through solidarity and donations. These workers' didn't get strike pay.So while the film is inspiring, emotional and will make you hate Thatcher even more, it doesn't get to the heart of how and why the TUC, the Labour Party and the union bureaucrats let the miners down. Thus viewers don't learn the lessons of how we can win next time.",False
6,6,Missed opportunity,brycetaylor1955,n/a,15/08/2025,"The makers of this documentary have missed an opportunity to present a balanced view of the 1984 strike. The perspective of the miners is powerfully told, bringing to life the feelings of the miners and their communities, and the divisions between Nottinghamshire and other mining areas. The footage and eye witness accounts of the events at Orgreave tell a powerful story of politicized policing. What is skimmed over is that this strike was called without a ballot. Its aim was paralyze the electricity supply and steel industries, and inflict damage on a democratically elected government with no thought to the impact on other vulnerable citizens through power cuts etc. We needed to hear from the other side of the dispute. Also useful would have been some portrayal of the damage the trade union movement in general was inflicting on the prosperity of the country through the 70's and early 80's. This was a hugely important factor in the decision of the Thatcher government to ""bend the rules"" to defeat this strike.Powerful viewing, worth watching, but flawed by it's lack of balance.",False
7,8,Sympathetic and powerful human stories,scrumpy_jon,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSeeing some other reviews on here about how 'biased' this documentary is is missing the point entirely. For 40 years there has been a biased telling of this story with text in the film itself pointing out that in 2016 the Tory rejected a review of the policing on that day. Hearing the first hand accounts is incredibly moving but the lack of justice and truth telling from the government and media is truly awful. Again, other reviews claiming that a bit of heavy-handed policing once again ignores a core tenant of this movie which is the fact that policing in Britain was effectively rewritten in 1983 for such an occasion as the miners' strike. There are amble cases of the falsehoods and injustice these men and women have faced over the years, at least allow this documentary to redress the imbalance in the narrative and allow the Tory government then and since be seen for what it is.",True
8,7,"A good documentary, some glaring omissions however",elliotcmbambury,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some really good interviews with ex miners and great footage, however it is very one sided in its politics ignoring the fact general strikes and flying pickets had been made illegal, it doesn't really go into how the country was being paralysed by mass striking, doesn't mention the 3 day week and the investigative journalists insinuate military tactics were being used by police in disorder such as baton guns which werent used, and state a change in police tactics needs to be voted on in parliment which is also incorrectScargill's role in the strikes was mainly over looked.A shame as there is some really good stuff and is still definitely worth a watch purely for the eye witness accounts and footage.",False
9,9,"Thorough, in-depth examination of a historical conflict",wellthatswhatithinkanyway,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSTAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulTW: References to suicide.Britain, the early 1980's. In the face of redundancies and pit closures, the National Union of Mineworkers comes into conflict with the National Coal Board, and strike action is declared from a national level, but faces resistance from individual pits, most notably Nottingham. Before long, the strike had become the longest and most protracted such event in history, leading to the infamous showdown between the miners and the police at the Battle of Orgreave, which some key figures involved give their version of events on here.The miners strike of 1984/85 happened around the time I was born, but has retained a place in the British cultural consciousness, as one of the longest and most drawn out strikes in living memory. Arthur Scargill was at the forefront of the action, spurred on by his success at the Saltley Coke plant in the early 70's, but it was the striking miners and their families who were truly on the frontline, and this lengthy, thorough documentary by director Daniel Gordon certainly leaves no stone unturned getting into the nitty gritty of it all.Living as I do in a time when trade unions have next to no power (apart from the train drivers), it's strange for me to see a time when there was so much solidarity and togetherness, but these 'pit communities' were a real example of that. These tiny little villages, where the local mine really was the main source of employment. Gordon's documentary presents the human cost of the strike, as key players recount the poverty they were forced to endure, even losing fellow strikers to suicide. Aside from this, it's reflected in the once thriving community itself, which now looks sadly derelict and deprived.Forty years after it happened, this event is still deeply embedded in the cultural consciousness, and has left unhealed scars till this day in the communities it affected. This documentary gives a voice to those closest to the action most effectively. ****",True
10,9,Excellent but ...,anxiousgayhorseonketamine,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is really well made it is extremely well made but it is entirely
mythologizing the miners as some kind of special human group which
others cannot possibly understand . The problem is here it is based entirely on a false
premise Mrs Thatcher did not wage wars on the miners she had no interest in the miners the
miners were lower-class people people she despised . In her worldview only the wealthy matter
45 years after she visited these shores the British Isles the place is destroyed shredded
nobody under the age of 40 will ever be able to afford housing she turned houses into investment
opportunities leaving the generations which come after unable to ever buy a home for themselves.She destroyed dental care which was free and available to all before she destroyed higher education she set the wheels in motion for privatization of practically everything public transport which used to be always average but adequate in the UK after coming to power became bit by bit more and more expensive more and more unreliable she is entirely to blame for all of this there are no positive aspects of Mrs Thatcher's in her time in power she was like Attila the Hun in a skirt .Now what we have to look at here is who was she really targeting she was not targeting the miners she was targeting Arthur Scargill and the unions she was targeting the power of the working class her entire time in power was class war she wanted to destroy and subjugate the bottom half of the population and she did that very very well people who admire her usually people in the top third of the of the earning population
respect her for that she made the wealthy wealthier the same process was going on at the same time in the USA a country run at the time by an ijut called Ronald Reagan both of these people Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were in fact following the moronic writings of Milton
Friedman and the Chicago School which is still followed in 2025 by the current Argentinian head
of state. Okay moving back to the miners this shows communities of people in the north
of England, Scotland, Kent, Wales, the northeast who were basically living in what looks to us now in 2025 like something out of a Dickensian period in little houses covered in coal dust
working in jobs which were so dangerous and many examples are given here of people who died in the mines which really quite frankly you cannot have nostalgia for but they seem to they have that, kind of generations of slaves underground slaves the mistake that was made was not to shut down the mines the mistake that was made was to despise the human group there and therefore not find any replacement job-wise you cannot take away people's livelihood like that completely and do nothing about it this was inhuman inhumane this is where it showed the true evil witch character of the prime minister of the timesShowing the guys getting back there in 2023 was interesting because you see them all probably
around the age of 60 or something and they're all fairly well dressed they don't look like they lost you know everything in the war but they still are nostalgic for this which to anybody who doesn't do that job looks like absolutely unbearable conditions of workSo the documentary here is extremely well put together interviewing some of the police people
who were there some of them quite shocked by what they were asked to do showing the scam and the lies which them their management and the government forced them into you cannot possibly tell people that you brought three quarters of the police force of England and Wales and that you really meant to be dealing a fair treatment to the people targeted.After Arthur Scargill and the unions lost to Margaret Thatcher they lost in 1984 and they lost for good after attila the hun in a skirt went by the country was never the same again
it is now all about money all about one-upmanship it's not quite the usa but it's trying hard to be I personally lived that entire period in the UK and to this day loath the woman absolutely profoundly loath the woman anybody who is interested in social rights in class struggle
in social history will really like this but I still think it is slightly skewed
as it is not naming the real enemy that she called ""the enemy within"" it was not the miners it was socialism she absolutely loathed socialism communism her favorite line was ""there is no such thing as society"" when you have that kind of belief you can destroy entire communities and not feel a thing and that is the kind of monster we were faced with in 1984 until
her being kicked out on the 22nd of november 1990 a day I still celebrate 🙃😉",False
11,3,Subjective rubbish,cumbrianfox-60953,n/a,15/08/2025,"No attempt made to provide any objectivity other than a couple of disgruntled ex police officers wheeled out to support the general tenor of the documentary. One might suppose from the content that the 5000 striking miners descending on Orgreave were there , in their' jeans and T shirts ' for a lovely nature ramble and were then set on by the thuggish lacky's of Mrs Thatcher's fascist state for no good reason . In fact the 5000 were there ( illegally as secondary pickets) to bring the rest of the country ( old and ill included) to its knees by disrupting power supplies and were out thought and out muscled by a ( thankfully) well organised police force. Did the police occasionally use too much force? Inevitability in such a large scale confrontation although nothing like the force that would have been brought to bear in any other country at that time.",False

2,10,A story of remarkable achievement,goodtobeseenfilmsllc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Baldy for the Blind is a film I caught at one of my favorite fests, Dances With Films. It played to a sold out house of over 450 people and I was so proud to be one of them. It tells the story of about 12 blind or visually impaired humans of all shapes and sizes brought together with one gigantic challenge. Try to climb the massively demanding Mount Baldy outside of Los Angeles. Daunting for hikers with real experience, not to mention the ability to see and focus clearly. The director did not just show us people overcoming incredible challenges, but also their hearts and by doing so, expanded my own. The film, as well as what these super human people with disabilities, is truly a remarkable achievement.",False
3,10,Baldy For The Blind: A beautiful triumph of the human spirit against all odds!,Craig-Weinstein,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Baldy For the Blind"" is a documentary film experience that stands out uniquely and pulls you into the world and lives of its ensemble cast, all of whom are blind or almost entirely blind all of whom come together with a single goal and personal challenge before them: to train and eventually scale the tallest mountain in Los Angels County with a peak of 10,064ft.Their shared journey up several successively difficult mountains leading up to Baldy is our main point of struggle-- difficult even for normally sighted hikers and even more so for these brave and determined folks from all walks of life-- but that is only half the story as throughout the film we learn more and more about their personal lives as they navigate the world minus one of our senses that most of us take for granted every day and how either growing up blind or suddenly being affected with blindness later in life both changed their world profoundly and yet also gave them a totally new perspective and determination to embrace this as a new way to open themselves up to new experiences that they had never considered before.The director Drea Castro employs a range of techniques expertly to keep us right on the edge of our anticipation for what will happen with each successive stage the hikers endure.Soaring shots show us the sheer beauty of these natural land formations... and also their danger to any and all who wish to scale them.Through it all these brave people all band together (along with their hiking sight guides) to form a close knit family like group who are all there for each other pushing, helping and striving to meet their goal of achieving something that they never thought possible for themselves.The hiking leader is an experienced, kind and yet tough individual who truly wants his team to succeed but who also knows exactly when to keep the pressure and inspiration strong to help them push themselves and grow in their hiking abilities.Seeing this film theatrically with an audience around me we were all deeply moved to tears by their stories, resilience and determination to succeed. Seeing some of these same people after the film concluded at the Q&A after the showing just made my reaction even stronger.""Baldy For the Blind"" involves scaling a mountain (well, several mountains actually) but its heart and soul is the scaling of one's own personal mountain and overcoming the challenge life has dealt by removing the ability to see and pushing far beyond fear and any myth of limits even despite this.As one of the hikers Jojo says early on in the film ""If I hadn't been born blind I don't know if I would have tried to do all these crazy things that I have taken on!""And for me that is the biggest takeaway and lesson these folks show us in this film: that there *are no* limits. That we *can* achieve anything we truly want to if we are determined enough no matter what the circumstances or odds may be.This is a truly beautiful and enormously inspiring documentary film. If have a chance to see it please do. It will change your life!",False
4,10,Inspirational,angelinadisco,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an incredible assemble of inspirational stories.

Between each individuals intertwining story that follows along with the preparations to climbing Mount Baldy, you will experience feelings of positivity, empowerment and awe. While it is remarkable watching any group work hard towards reaching their goals, watching a group of people go against expectations is something entirely different. Each of these individuals decided prove to themselves if they can do anything that they said their minds to.Do yourself a favor, and watch this movie. Your heart will thank you later.",False

6,10,What a brilliant and Unique Documentary!,annabella7-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary really puts things into perspective. It's wonderfully, and compassionately shot. Clearly the director/camera crew climbed Mt. Baldy several times themselves. I was so humbled by this piece. Such beautiful humanity captured in the interviews, in the challenge itself. I sobbed through the whole thing; the things we forget to appreciate in life, that others dream of doing. I loved getting to know each of the sight challenged climbers and how their lives were affected by this amazing feat. This documentary is a well rounded and heart opening telling of reaching peaks we can't even see. I loved, and appreciate this documentary so much.",False
7,10,Incredible film of overcoming,wilkinson-lindsey,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such an incredible film of overcoming obstacles and setting out to do something beyond one's set limitations. Even the film maker herself has overcome so much in making this film. Each character brings so much light and depth to this film that is both tragic and inspiring. After watching ""Baldy for the Blind"" I am left to consider so much about my own life and what my mountain is. I can sense that there is a way to see the world from a whole new perspective.So often blind people are depicted in the fullness of their humanity and this film does a great job sharing the different lives of all these hikers and their individual stories moving through a world they can't always access. There is so much value in supporting the efforts to make the world accessible to everyone and how absolutely life changing it can be too do so. This film left me inspired to do more and maybe take on bigger risks than I would dare to before. Highly recommend giving it a watch!!",False
8,10,Facing your fears,christianbustamante,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had to opportunity to catch ""Baldy for the Blind"" at this years Dances with Films, and this documentary really stood out. This film highlights the experiences of a group of blind hikers who dare to face their fears and climb the tallest mountain in Los Angeles. To an average sighted individual, the experience is physically challenging - an opportunity to get some exercise in, bond with friends. But filmmaker, Drea Castro, really took us into the minds of these unsighted hikers to understand what facing their own fears looks and feels like. We saw some of what their daily lives look like, what many of us may assume is a world of darkness and struggle, but saw so much past that, and how much light there actually is in their lives. What was particularly special about this film was the level of intimacy the director, Drea, was able to capture with her subjects, and the trust she created shined through in the filmmaking. The community the blind hikers they formed within each other, to accomplish this physically and mentally challenging obstacle was nothing short of inspiring. We are living in a time where so much of the world feels chaotic and uncertain, it was such a gift to be able to enjoy a film that brought some peace, joy and inspiration to the world, all while showcasing a group of people who are often unseen. If you get a chance to watch this film, you may find yourself experiencing your own peaks and valleys of emotions. I highly recommend it.",False
9,10,Inspiring you to the bone,nickbarber-04571,n/a,16/08/2025,"Baldy for the Blind"" is a compelling docu that beautifully illustrates the indomitable spirit of humanity, proving that we are far more capable than we may initially perceive. Throughout the movie, the inner drive of individuals to push themselves beyond their limits is showcased with exceptional pace.One of the most memorable moments for me is with its ability to immerse viewers in the hikers' journey, allowing us to deeply connect with their triumphs and challenges. As we witness their highs and lows, we can't help but become emotionally invested, cheering for them as they strive to conquer the challenge presented Infront of them.I can't wait for more people to catch this!",False
10,10,Looking for an inspiring movie? Watch this!,rasecmarcortega,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Baldy For The Blind"" reminded me of what courage and gratitude looks like. This film shows us a group of hikers conquering mountains despite their inability to see. Their acts of courage and resilience exposed my own hurdles that I have made up for myself through excuses. Their stories moved me in a way that surfaced my own unrecognized inhibiting mindsets. One of the hikers said something along the lines of ""choosing to be hindered by their blindness, or choosing to be happy"" and that they chose happiness. It was such a powerful showcase of how you can choose to not be victimized by something as real as visual impairment. There is so much that I have learned from this film. Thank you Drea Castro. Thank you blind hikers and guides for your display of character that inspires me to become better myself.",False
11,10,You'll laugh & cry and walk away inspired,Charlie_Chappell,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to get a chance to watch Baldy for the Blind at the Los Angeles Dances With Films film festival in a standing room only, packed audience. It was an absolutely amazing experience to hear all of these incredible stories of vision impaired hikers, as they came together to conquer a series of mountains leading to Mount Baldy. A mountain, frankly, even people who aren't blind struggle to climb.The crowd reactions in the screening were palpable. Everyone around me, including myself, was in tears, multiple times, and the laughter and joy shared as these truly inspirational people made their way through each successive hike was extremely uplifting, no pun intended.Frankly, It should have won the festival, and I think partially due to the voting format closing within 10 minutes of the wrap of the movie paired with an equally inspiring Q&A with some of the hikers featured, and standing ovation kind of robbed them of the award. It deserves to be seen by all.That said, I could not recommend this movie more, especially to anyone who finds themselves in a situation that feels unsurmountable, because as they state time and time again you can do anything you put your mind to. Whether you can see the next step ahead of you or not, you just have to carry on.",False
12,10,Inspiring and moving,findingmanilatown,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe you're not a hiker or an outdoorsy human, but seeing this film will make you want to work for your dream, no matter how insurmountable it may seem. This documentary was told in the perspective of the blind hikers and their voices unadulterated to fit a bigger political campaign. I appreciated that. Their stories are their own and we held our breath until each of them crossed their proverbial threshold. I'm so in awe of the cast and I didn't know about the Braille institute prior to this but I'm thankful they exist to facilitate success and autonomy for the differently abled. This documentary is for everyone that feels their purpose or dream is out of reach... it's really within grasp, just one foot in front of the other ;)",False
13,10,The film we all need!,bobbypontillas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Drea Castro's Baldy for the Blind is an extraordinary documentary that stole my heart from start to finish. It's a heartwarming story that showcases the strength and resilience of the human spirit. It's an incredible journey that shows the power of determination and the unwavering pursuit of one's dreams, no matter the obstacles.The filmmakers beautifully capture both the struggles and triumphs of the hikers, which really resonates with me. The cinematography is stunning and adds such an immersive quality to the film.

The storytelling blends grandiose aerial shots with intimate close-ups, providing a deep emotional connection to its cast. The director's love for them effortlessly makes you love them too.What truly sets the film apart is the authentic portrayal of the visually impaired hikers- it showcases their abilities rather than their disabilities, and presents them as strong, capable individuals who conquer challenges head-on. Seeing their determination in the face of adversity was profoundly inspiring and left a lasting impact on me.Baldy for the Blind is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful documentary that leaves me with a sense of hope and admiration for those who overcome adversities with grace and courage.

14,10,A Must See Masterpiece!,kloepfel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Baldy for the Blind is one of the most moving and important films I have ever seen. It absoltely has to be made available to world wide audiences. It has so much heart, superb story telling and even suspense. Truly inspirational and well crafted. We come to know and love the hikers and their stories as well the as the coach and guides! Brilliant work. I have told so many friends and colleagues (psychologists) about this, who are now eagerly awaiting streaming options. Congratulations and thanks to all who participated in making this happen.

15,10,"Humbling, inspiring film",vance-55689,n/a,16/08/2025,"Baldy for the Blind puts things in a new perspective and takes you on a climb up an emotional mountain, figuratively and literally. I marveled at the courage of the blind hikers, and was profoundly inspired by their determination and spirit, but what it really brought home were the unique personal stories and backgrounds for each of these people. They deal with disabilities in their everyday lives, which is tough enough - but they decided to do something extraordinary in an effort to prove something to themselves. Not for any kind of glory or even for the film - but because ""the mountain is there"" for non-sighted people as well as for the rest of us. Thank you to the subjects, the filmmakers (and shout out to the sight guides, too!) for a tremendous story of effort, perseverance, ant triumph!",False
16,10,marvelous,alida-69844,n/a,16/08/2025,"Baldy for the Blind is a masterfully crafted film, Oscar worthy without question.It follows a group of visually impaired hikers from different walks of life on a journey so challenging, many sighted people could not or would not undertake it.The personal backstories of each hiker are so deftly woven through the scenes of the many training hikes taken in preparation for the final ascent to Mt Baldy summit, that the viewer feels drawn into the journey along with the hikers.Drea Castro has artfully crafted an honest and enlightening look into the world of those who must navigate through life without sight - a sense we all take too much for granted. And in so doing, her film deeply and indelibly touches our hearts in a way we might not quite have imagined it would. We are inspired by the human spirit, so evident in the endeavor of each one of these courageous people.This is a beautiful film, beautifully crafted and most deserving of our admiration and respect.I was privileged to have been invited to see it and so grateful for the experience.",False
17,10,INCREDIBLE FILM- A MUST WATCH,triciacbrooks,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""Baldy for the Blind"" is an extraordinarily, important film that I believe everyone needs to watch.This film inspires all of us to go for our dreams regardless of what people say we are capable of and what we are not. It's a beautiful testament to human strength, determination and an incredible piece of art.I fell in love with all the people apart of this film and found myself rooting for them as they were hiking in real time. It was incredibly moving while also being riveting and entertaining. This is why we make art in my opinion- so we can shed light on different perspectives, bring people together and give a voice to those that are not always heard.I'm also deeply connected to this film because I have a family member who is blind and found it refreshing to see her experience on screen. I could see so much of her in each of the visually impaired participants of the hike and for that I am grateful. Thank you for making this film. Thank you for giving visually impaired people a voice and sharing that they are extremely capable.",True
18,10,"Inspiring, engaging and entertaining - reach for the mountains!",markvirgin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I recently watched the amazing documentary film, Baldy for the Blind. It is a great, thought-provoking story about how a hiking guide decided to commit to training a group of blind hikers to summit one of Southern California's tallest and most challenging mountains, Mt. Baldy.A challenging - and unfortunately deadly - trail even for highly experienced, sighted hikers, we follow along with the group as they hike ever-longer and tougher trails in preparation for the attempt at the summit of Mt. Baldy.The story is well told, paced nicely, and we get to experience the hikes from the hikers' POV as they conquer each hike. With each hike, more is revealed about each blind hiker - their fears and dreams, and their individual motivations for undertaking such a challenging series of hikes!Thank you to the film makers for making this movie that spotlights these visually impaired hikers who clearly have a zest for life! Too often, folks with visual impairments are not given the recognition they deserve for the many daily accomplishments and adjustments they make in order to live their best lives.Baldy for the Blind shows that those with visual impairment can achieve amazing feats, those that would rival anything you can think of!",False
19,10,What an Amazing and Unforgettable Film!,TheMrHarryLime,n/a,16/08/2025,"My friends and I went to see this in a sold-out theatre in LA and it was one of the best and most intense viewing experiences we've had in a while! The whole audience was gripped - completely silent during the tense moments, cracking up at some of the funny characters, weeping and yelling at the screen during many of the sad and depressing moments - exactly what you want when going to the theatre!The film will also stay in your mind long after you leave the theatre - it raises such important, thoughtful, and challenging questions about our treatment of the differently abled! There's one part in the movie where the character of DJ talks about how invisible Blind people often feel, often ""hid away"" from society, and it really made me think!A lot happens in this film and I believe it's definitely worth a second viewing - I will try see it again! Go see it - it's amazing!",False
20,10,"Prepare to laugh, cry and feel ALL the emotions!",jennifer-69489,n/a,16/08/2025,"The premiere of ""Baldy for the Blind"" was an inspiring and heartwarming event!Not only did it showcase the incredible determination and resilience of these 11 remarkable hikers as they attempt tp summit Mt. Baldy with limited vision, but it also highlighted filmmaker Drea Castro's gift of storytelling.The audience in attendance at the sold-out TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood was moved to tears during the film, and their applause was truly impressive.

This powerful documentary left no one in the theatre untouched with its important message about our capacity to overcome struggles, no matter what obstacles may stand in our way.""Baldy for the Blind"" is sure to inspire anyone who sees it.Congratulations again Drea! I can't wait to see what magic is to come from you!!",False
21,10,Inspiring on many levels,animalplaidart,n/a,16/08/2025,"The human spirit is truly remarkable in that it constantly rises above what is thought to be undoable or unnecessary. Blind people don't hike to 10,000 feet; I mean why hike at all if you can't see the view. You could actually call this film Baldy for the the spirit or Baldy for the indomitable. These people are blind and that isn't really the main story. The main story is that they hiked to a place that few folks can, including myself. In short what you take away from this gem of a film is the message that life is filled with obstacles and you got two choices. Lay down and fade or get up and push past the expectations. Bravo to the filmmakers and the hikers for showing that life is not about 5 senses or even 4 senses. It's about one sense, the sense of wonder. ""nuff said.",False
22,10,A triumphant and thoughtful film!,clonebrother2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Baldy for the Blind is such a wonderful piece of filmmaking because it works on so many levels.On the face of it, it starts as the story of the visually impaired and their attempt to trek to the summit of Mt. Baldy. And if this was all that it covered, it would be an effective documentary. But as I watched the film, I was consistently astonished on how it effortlessly weaved the various threads of the story:A chronicle of the challenges faced hiking Mt. Baldy and the strength of the guides and experts who inspire those in their care.The history and deeply moving portraits of its subjects - we see the people behind the visual impairments.An eye-opening view of blindness and those who refuse to let it define them.A celebration of the individual spirit and how everyday people can overcome personal and physical obstacles to achieve something truly remarkable.The love and care that director/producer Drea Castro has put in to crafting this film is evident from the very first frame to the very last.I literally couldn't stop thinking about it after watching it. It's a film that I will think about for years to come.Heartwarming and moving, Baldy for the Blind is an inspirational must-see for all. We need more films like this.",False
23,10,What a metaphor....,halbastian,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Baldly for the Blind"" is a beautiful metaphor for the ups and downs (pun intended) of life for both the sighted and the blind. The brave participants in this film are compelling, vulnerable, strong and fearless. Everything resonated with me, especially that as a sighted person, I don't really have any challenges to speak of and my perspective on life has been changed for the better. Much better. There are stories within stories and I had empathy, compassion and respect for all the climbers. There are many moments of suspense, anticipation and hope. Wow, just wow.

24,10,A film of inner strength and courage,Joprecious,n/a,16/08/2025,"Baldy For The Blind was an amazing documentary which followed 12 blind hikers to the summit of Mount Baldy, the highest peak in Los Angeles. I was so captivated by the courage of these blind hikers to even want to take on such a challenge. I was amazed that they chose Mount Baldy as hiking a mountain, especially Mount Baldy, is challenging for a sited person, never mind someone with a disability. The film really captured the hikers inner feelings and struggles along their journey, along with their joys of overcoming their fears.

This documentary will take you through moments of suffering and emotional courage but from a very motivating perspective. Even in the moments when we see several members give up on this difficult test, you feel how your mind and heart light up for wanting to have been there and extend a helping hand or be that voice of motivation to see them fulfill this dream.The feeling of wanting to stand and applaud once the group reaches the summit is inevitable, seeing the great work of the team that accompanies this beautiful group of people is indescribable and the fact of having come so far in the face of such harsh geographical conditions makes your eyes teary for joy and inspiration.Thank you, Drea and the Baldy for the Blind team/crew, for your hard work in getting this message to the big screen!10/10!",True

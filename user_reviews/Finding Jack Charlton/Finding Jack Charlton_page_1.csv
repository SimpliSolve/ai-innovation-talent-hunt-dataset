1,8,Worth the watch,simonlambert-01936,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before I write anything else, I will say now that this is worth watching if you're a fan of the game. It skips over his playing career but delves intricately into his managerial career with the ROI. Hard to watch at times as it doesn't skirt from the big issues but overall it's an honest and interesting approach of the life of a great player, manager and person.",False
2,7,Damn ageing,kevin c,n/a,16/08/2025,Lovely documentary charting the World Cup winner and Ireland's adopted hero. The Italia '90 story is captivating and the dementia final curtain devestating.,False
3,9,Amazing,culturalfatwa,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes
You could argue the subject and times were almost an open goal but this is exceptionally well done. It doesn't back off his dementia or the faults and failings of both Jack and the team but also captures the time.
Great editing and stringing together of a huge variety of source material.
One of the weirdest things is where they combine the Romania penalty shoot out with Lankum's version, of 'the wild rover' .. Much like David O'Leary taking the peno.. Shouldn't work.. But does!",False
4,10,Amazing Documentary,dankmoore-26832,n/a,16/08/2025,I remember fondly as a child and teenager watching Ireland play in Italy and USA. To see this kind of insight into not only the soccer side but also how Ireland was struggling during these times was done superbly. Very insightful documentary and very touching. To see the effects of dementia on such an amazing colourful character is very sad to see but it is portrayed extremely well and this film brings you through a great journey. A truly great tribute and story very well told,False
5,10,Ten stars and I don't even like football!,bronaghbop,n/a,16/08/2025,Jackie Charlton contributed to the peace process by bolstering Ireland's self esteem when it was in tatters. His decline into dementia was heartbreaking. Please stop heading the ball.,False
6,9,RIP Jack,valleyjohn,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's not much love lost between the Irish and the English . The English generally like Ireland and its people but that feeling is not reciprocated, which is all the more amazing that an Englishman , became a legend and was loved by the Irish nation and that man was Jack Charlton.This documentary follows Jack's love affair with Ireland and is interspersed with clips of him in his in his last years when he was suffering from dementia.While this tells the story about his footballing career , it's far more than that .It's about two brothers who never really got on with each other but quite clearly loved one other . They were just to stubborn to tell each other .It's about coping with dementia and if heading footballs was the cause of the disease and mostly it's about that wonderful Irish experience and how a nation went against everything they believed in and took an Englishman into their hearts .How Jack Charlton never got a Knighthood is a scandal . The English governments who had the chance to put this right should be utterly ashamed of themselves.RIP Jack.",False
7,8,Bigger than football,paudieconnolly,n/a,16/08/2025,The Yorkshire man who won the World Cup for the country of his birth a bigger affect was to come on the country of his adoption. Reclaiming a flag restoring a pride and adding a brighter shade of Green to the future. Jack may forget Ireland but Ireland will never forget Jack. Captured beautifully in this documentary.,False
8,8,The Jack we love and remember,bosullivan2-719-143250,n/a,16/08/2025,God what a trip down memory lane. So delighted that this movie was made. Difficult to watch the newer scenes with old Jack. But makes the older scenes all the more powerful for it. Delighted to see he has a family who cares for him so much. I hope I'm as lucky some day. I think if the young Jack was around he'd be happy with both outcomes. Although maybe he'd have cut the nudy changing room scene. He was obviously great craic! Long may his memory live forever in Irish hearts. Long live Jack.,False
9,10,Possibly my favourite sports film ever.,FONYMAHONEY,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautifully realised tribute to one of the absolute greats of English football - and yet in tandem, the most heartbreaking representation of dementia since Florian Zeller's 'The Father'.They don't make footballers - or, frankly, people - like Jackie Charlton anymore. In a world of spineless, pandering yes people lapping up the kool aid, Jack Charlton was more than a breath of fresh air - he was an essential presence with an unmatched charisma in the world of sport. Losing Jack Charlton (and, for similar reasons - Shane MacGowan) almost feels like an ascension of the unique greats the rest of us conformist mortals aren't privy to.Watch this film. Even if you don't know about football, or who Jack Charlton is.After struggling throughout to remember his own most iconic milestones - The moment he recognised Paul McGrath is one of the single most beautiful instances ever captured on film.",False
10,10,Insightful documentary on the remarkable Jack Charlton,riccardomantio,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary takes you on a rollercoaster of how and Englishman restored pride and self respect of the Irish . He used football as a means to an end . Please watch wonderfully put together.,False
11,10,Beautifully made sensitive documentary,qifitness,n/a,16/08/2025,"Reviewing as a former film editor of many years experience in broadcast TV...
It is really difficult to make a documentary that doesn't need a dubbed commentary.This film is a first-class example that has been beautifully and sensitively crafted.A 'must watch' even for anyone not a football fan.Sadly, dementia led to Jack's death and the now understood link between dementia and footballers whose careers involved much heading of the ball is thankfully behind understood.",False

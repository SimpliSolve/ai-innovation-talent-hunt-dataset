1,9,Complex journey told honestly,zenoron,n/a,16/08/2025,"Observational doco filmed over six years as two amazing people negotiate transitioning and their love. This doco has so much heart. It never felt didactic, remains complex and very moving.",False
2,9,Painfully beautiful,sashadoll,n/a,16/08/2025,"Filmed in my city of Perth and as someone who started HRT to transition just 5 days ago, it made me question everything.It should almost be required viewing before beginning the process. It poses the question; how much are we prepared to hurt others to live life the way we want. The selfishness and simultaneous agony of Elle is almost too much to bare, whilst the selflessness and grief of her partner is heart-wrenching.Whilst the film is entirely non-judgemental in its portrayal of Elle's transition, it destroys the notion of a happy-ever-after life post-transition. The idea of transitioning to a pin-up-esque barbie doll with a glamourous life, body and pretty face is shown up to be little more than a dream and the realities of being viewed as freakish are (whilst not depicted) implied.",False
3,9,"Open, honest, comforting",cj-70250,n/a,16/08/2025,"An authentic documentary, brutally honest, heartbreaking, yet comforting.This documentary is an absolute must not only for people directly affected by the topic (transgender) but for everybody. By watching the journey of Ellen and Lauren you may come to understand how trans people are feeling and thinking, the hard decisions they have to make, the cruel consequences those decisions might bring to their lives. You also witness what being trans can mean for their loved one and how strong love can be. If you've ever been in a challenging relationship I'm sure you can relate to the efforts Ellen and Lauren made during the time the doco was filmed.A brilliant documentary which can't be credited enough!",False
4,10,Powerful and engaging,mimihelm,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is a poignant exploration of love and transitioning. The filmmakers do a beautiful job of showing us the torment, joy and catharsis Elle and Lauren both experience. One of the best documentaries I've ever seen.",False
5,10,Wow!,sallyjb,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the privilege to witness Lauren and Elle's journey in this amazing documentary. Their love, their hardships and the impact on them, family and friends. All filmed with so much love, honesty and such bravery. How we need to see documentaries like this! An important journey for ALL of us to witness.",False
6,10,Heart wrenching,ansmac,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film was an incredibly important piece sharing the under represented voices of the trans community and their loved ones. This documentary has beautifully shown the trials, pitfalls and deep human compassion and love that this couple have for one another on a difficult journey to be true to ones self. I hope this documentary encourages more people to share their stories and more creators to create a platform for people to speak up about their true identity.",False
7,10,Beautiful and Necessary,olimandias,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everything I love about a documentary. The experience of watching Girl Like You, with its observational approach to filmmaking feels as though we are right there with the Elle and Lauren, naturally witnessing their journey through Elle's transition and how it affects them as a couple. Rather than being told how to feel through narration or similar - we see in real time the key milestones of their relationship through home filmed footage, and interviews updating the documentarians on their feelings over the years.The level of access and openness on the part of the two subjects is so incredibly brave but I think ultimately delivers a valuable story for society. For audiences with previously little understanding of the struggles of transgender people - it sheds light onto how someone like Elle may feel when positioned in our current culture and teaches a profound empathy for them. For people navigating their own identity, the relatability felt by Elle's transition and her relationship to Lauren I'm sure is either validating or revelatory for some.Girl Like You is also at its heart just a beautiful and bittersweet love story, portraying deep insight of the high and lows of a modern 21st century relationship.",False

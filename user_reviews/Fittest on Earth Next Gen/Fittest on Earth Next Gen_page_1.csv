1,6,"Good, but not great",mikehoare,n/a,15/08/2025,Not as good as the previous fittest on earth series from previous years. There was a bit more focus on the athletes backstories and less on thr story of the games.Not one full event was shown and event standings throughout the documentary we're rushed.,False
2,4,WHO IS WORKING ON SOUND???,bazwestland,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nothing to add to a series of doc's that continually bring together nicely the last year's events. That is, except, asking: ""who worked on sound?"" Sound can break a movie and the slack attention to detail here is really annoying. Please get back to the edit and reissue this... otherwise it's cheap to charge to watch this.",False
3,n/a,"Huge fan, but",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I couldn't hear the narration over the music at all. I watched for 10 minutes hoping the music would get lower, it didn't, jumped to an hour and it was still going on. Headache inducing constant ambient music track louder than the voices makes this unwatchable.",False
4,5,Just Alright,jemmas12,n/a,15/08/2025,"Felt more like a film for Tia than a 21 doc barley showed other athletes. Tia came across more arrogant than confident.Loved Annie and Justin's parts, and Pat is always funny.Some good moments but more bad than good, barley showed the leaderboard and the events were hard to follow/understand if you didn't remember, audio was horrible in some parts, so many great moments and athletes left out.I know there's been a lot of talk about the title but it's true considering the majority of the film is spent on the veterans and there's barley any next gen. Would say it's on the bottom of the docs so far.",False
5,2,Got bored and turned it off.,prerostlaura,n/a,15/08/2025,"You could say my husband and I are CrossFit obsessed-, we've watched every documentary at least 10 times and have always loved when the new docs come out. But in addition to the sound being completely off (music was was too loud and drowned out the voices of when anyone spoke), we were just kinda of bored. Turned it off with 55 mins to go. We bought it so I'm sure we'll finish it at some point but yeah- just disappointing. Also kinda bogus that they didn't put any interviews with Dave in there and Adrian Bozeman calls it ""the finals"" instead of the games, and it's called next gen, which makes no sense. LOL. Hopefully the buttery bros will make the next one!",False
6,3,I'd hire Heber and Marston to direct 2022,ianadams-24739,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis should be titled ""The Fittest - Tia Clair"" because that's what you're watching. Which on one hand makes sense, she's the GOAT but give her her own movie. As far as the rest of the documentary is concerned:1.) Not very exciting at all. Why are we watching the events in like this weird highlight form where I'm watching the end > beginning > middle but not showing you know, the event in sequential order while showing off the people that won. Daniel Brandon's insane handstand walk? Nothing but a mention, Gi's and Royce's snatch battle? Nope. Jeff Adler being the only one to do the clean, run event. NOTHING! It's a huge disservice to the athletes who should be getting the recognition they deserve for beating the greatest CrossFit athletes in the world at an event.2.) About an hour thirty into the movie they actually give about 2 mins talking about the changing of the guard with some cool footage of Panchik, Mal, etc. Other than that we don't get much interviews from anybody, I mean hardly anything, unless your name was Tia, Annie, Justin, or Pat. Would've been cool to hear from Dukic, Hopper, Katrin, Eramo, people that won events or came close to winning.3.) There were some great story lines, Annie's return after giving birth, Tia's domination, the new kids on the block, Panchik retiring, Holte retiring, who'd become the new men's champ, how Covid affected things. That being said all of these were touched on but could have had way more air time. This could've been like a limited series and done a better job of hitting on these.All and all, the media team that got fired a few years back had this incredible ability to make great content around CrossFit and the CrossFit games because they were purists, in my opinion. They knew the athletes, the sport, they loved it, they knew who to talk to, etc. So for 2022 let's reach out to Sevan, Heber, Marston, and the rest of the team who worked on the years past for at least some consulting on how to make 2022 Fittest better.",True
7,2,What happened ???,samanthahaxton,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love CrossFit and can't wait for this show every year. Everyone left with a personality wasn't given any time or much time. Such a disappointment, and apparently they are now going for boring as a goal.",False
8,1,Bring back the Buttery Bros!!!!,andrewcanderton,n/a,15/08/2025,"Since Heb's and Mar's have been outed from these movies they've taken a rapid downward spiral. Boring as all hell!! Come on CrossFit, sort out whatever it's was that pushed the Buttery Bros out and bring them back ASAP.Also, why is there this constant need to cut people who don't fall inline with HQ. Dave was instrumental to this Games and boom, cut from the movie other than visuals. We're a community. Treat it that way!To sum it up.... Booooo!",False
9,4,What Next Gen?,edwardarmitage,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis gave all the promise of showing the rise of athletes in CrossFit and where the sport is going. Sadly, this did not turn out to be the case, this was the Tia Clair Toomey show with a smattering of others. Yes she is the most dominant athlete of all time, yes she is clearly the best, however did she come across as arrogant? Perhaps. Saying workouts were easy and almost mocking that the programming was easy didn't come across well. Justin Mederios was heavily featured and rightly so under the premise of next gen, however the likes of hayley adams, Gabi Migala, Jayson Hopper, Danielle Brandon, Saxon Panchik got very little airtime and they are the ones taking the sport forward. We all love a montage and in this there are in abundance which is a big plus, but this was no different to a YouTube behind the scenes we see now. It just feels like CrossFit missed a real chance to show where the games is going.",True
10,2,"just people talking, no idea whats going on with the competition, completely useless ....more like EXTRAS on DVDs",linh_0212,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSeriously, 90% of the film is people talking, no idea or the feel of the competition, WE WANT TO WATCH CROSSFIT competition, not BTS stuff. This is what the EXTRAS on the DVDs used to be like, not the main movie.I have been a huge fan for years, but this is outrageously boring because you dont get the rush of watching a competition. Feel like B-crew practicing how do to a doco, where is the A-team that use dot do all the previous movies???I have been a huge fan for years, but this is outrageously boring because you dont get the rush of watching a competition.

11,3,Boring and Predictable,joveraker6-40-528900,n/a,15/08/2025,Production value was not great and the overall coverage was spotty and just plain boring. No build up and nothing left to the imagination as far as who wins individual events and who takes the overall title.Only a few athletes covered throughout the documentary and those stories were surface at best. Seems like a good group of young talent coming in the next few years. Have to say Medeiros' mullet was the most interesting part of the whole thing.Definitely not what it used to be and I hope the CrossFit peeps can sort this out for the next one. Disappointing because I was really excited to watch and.,False

1,4,Why would a Geologist/Engineer be Armed?,CodeCarter,n/a,16/08/2025,"As much as I'd like this to be true, why would a Geologist go to work Armed down a desert mine/shaft?What was he thinking of bumping into some Graboids or something?... if so, a sidearm wouldn't help...lolWhy wouldn't he show the massive scar where this Alien Death Ray (Giggles) Opened him up like a fish?Its guys like this that give the Alien hypostasis a bad name and why many don't take the Alien topic seriously!",False
2,1,Lmao,sinusbooger,n/a,16/08/2025,A sad story of a delusional man. I am a structural engineer and a geologist and a self taught metallurgist. Right. A green beret died while rescuing me after I was opened up like a fish by the alien death ray. Right. Let's see the fish guts scar. You don't even know the name of the green beret who died for you? What a total load of ignorant bs. Ridiculous .,False
3,2,Clearly Delusional,bs-33435,n/a,16/08/2025,You don't have to be a psychiatrist (or self taught metallurgist) to see serious mental illness on display here. Unfortunately the documentarians (or satirists? I'm not sure if they are well-meaning or making fun of the poor guy) go to great lengths to dive deeply into the madness without questioning it too much. Also rating it based on really shoddy production values.,False
4,2,Depressing,qhgweexzu,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wish all this was true. It would be amazing. But after a few minutes of listening to Phil it is apparent that he's paranoid and delusional. Everything is anecdotal. No evidence. He claims to have been shot, been sliced open by an alien laser weapon, had a green beret rescue him but also die simultaneously... each claim on its own is interesting but when you add it all up he seems completely detached from reality. I felt bad for him after this and angry at people that have taken advantage of him for their profit and entertainment.",False
5,10,Complete overview of P.Schneider information,satorimapping,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have seen most of Schneider's lectures from 1995 and this documentary provides a good overview of the available information about him and his life without going to deep into the lectures itself.It does so fairly objectively in my opinion.Bear in mind, that Schneider's lectures were explosive in its content; the documentary does not add any subjectives elements.It is not the documentary saying these crazy ideas, it was Phil who brought to light these unworldly activities.It's nice work this movie! Ignore other comments who have not watched Phil's lectures. Should you watch his lectures, watch the earliest lectures first where his recollection and mind was most clear.",False
6,1,Nothing new here...,hamvak2012,n/a,16/08/2025,"The fact that it begins with ""news"" reports from RT really blows this film's credibility to bits. They have no vested interest in telling the truth or reporting responsibly on things in a country they would love to destabilize. No photographic proof, just stock photos of drilling equipment from around the world and speculation...lots of it. Just like most UFO stuff, except underground and no footage. Waste of 50 minutes.",False
7,10,Big Yes,ham-ma242,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watch it, especially if you are doing research about Agartha/Avalon and Hollow/Inner/Honeycomb Earth. It puts a lot of pieces together, though Phil Schneider videos would be even better, coming from the source of this doc.",False
8,1,Terrible,vsx819,n/a,16/08/2025,"This guys has already been exposed as a mentally unstable person.
He provided no evidence what so ever, never provided any locations exactly where he was working, in fact there was no evidence at all.
Everything he said you can tell his is not well educated, his eyes are shifting all the time, he cant look anyone in the eyes and even his friends said he was mentally ill. Why are they doing movies about him?",False
9,1,So bad I didn't even finish it,dmittra-list,n/a,16/08/2025,"Conspiracy theory about aliens in underground bases, by ""experts"" that have seen them. Ugh! So stupid that I switched off after 15 minutes",False
10,1,As bad conspiracies goes - this one is really bad.,TheOtherMovieGuy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not sure if this is a sad reflection of society where it's OK to make a mockery of someone's mental illness. As one other reviewer pointed out, you don't need to be a certified psychologist to see that all is not well in Phil's mind. In the pursuit of making money, this documentary takes the delusional and unsubstantiated claims as true and doesn't challenge a single one of them. Unfortunately, this is not a new low in in documentary filmmaking but it certainly sits firmly on a low-water mark. If you've already watched it - too bad. But you're checking out reviews to decide of it's worth watching then I strongly suggest to watch something else. May I be as bold to suggest the show 'UFOs: The Lost Evidence'.I'm no E. T. / alien believer but as far the topic goes, this is not a bad show. Way better than 'The Underground'.",False
11,3,"Even if he was killed, this is a bad documentary",alexfiles,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe politics and poorly supported ideas here do nothing to solve the mystery of someone who may very well have been murdered (and not necessarily by the government, either). Instead, it feels like the opposite of an investigation is happening: the suspicious death of someone who might have been unstable or might have had insight into unexplained phenomena is leveraged for political grandstanding. It's a mishmash of occult Nazis, miles-deep bunkers by both aliens and humans, and UN/gun rights grumping, none of which connects the dots. I would not waste my time on this documentary; I kind of resent the time it stole from me. Go watch something better, like Encounters or some-such.",True
12,10,Interesting Documentary,paranaturalenigma,n/a,16/08/2025,Well made and put together. Lots of interesting information. Excellent work !,False
13,n/a,RUSSIAN FAKE NEWS/DOCUMENTARY!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie shows parts of interviews
and news shows from the Russian propaganda tv channel RT. RT is nothing but a manipulative and lying Russian propaganda channel.",False

1,10,The horrors of big animal agriculture and their CAFOs,tep1-942-418153,n/a,16/08/2025,"What happens when you own a home but big animal agriculture moves in? This important documentary explores this horrible situation, which was forced on residents in eastern North Carolina.Cities, even small cities, are required to treat human waste, but there appears to be no regulations forcing CAFOs (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations) to treat animal waste. They are free to literally spray feces on their neighbors, spread disease, and destroy nearby lakes, rivers and streams.This movie is likely to leave you angry at big factory farms and their pursuit of money over everything. It'll likely leave you upset over politicians that back big business over basic decency. It'll likely make you question whether we should be supporting these businesses by buying their products.",False
2,10,"A powerful, MUST-SEE movie!",ScottduPont,n/a,16/08/2025,"I got to attend an LA screening of The Smell of Money documentary last night and was blown away by what Sean Bannon, Jaime Berger and the rest of the production team exposed. This was such a visceral, shocking film that I recommend everybody watch! In addition, what was so unique about this documentary (unlike so many others), it did not at all cover or dive into all of the animal rights or animal suffering issues, but for the first time eloquently focuses on the rights of neighbors, living by these hog farms as well as the rights of entire impovershed neighborhoods surrounding these massive factory farms. This film exposes the entire political-industrial apparatus that is clearly a broken system. Without any spoilers, the filmmakers leave you at the end with a few ""Calls to Action"" and hope for change and a better future I applaud all of the producers for creating this powerful, MUST-SEE movie!",False
3,10,DO NOT MISS THIS FILM,liisapb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film made my heart hurt for the residents who have had to deal with the environmental justices in Eastern NC for decades. Many are slave descendants and are still, in some ways enslaved. I really appreciate the film-makers opening our eyes to this and allowing us to get to know the people on a personal level. It was so moving and made me want to do my part to make a difference.DO NOT MISS THIS FILM - you will not regret seeing it! Please watch and encourage everyone you know to watch. Educating the public is the best way to make a difference! WE can change these circumstances with our shopping habits and our votes.",False
4,10,I can't believe we're letting this happen in my state,seankennedy-65373,n/a,16/08/2025,"I live in North Carolina, and we pride ourselves on freedom and taking care of one another. This documentary exposes that we are supporting the exact opposite of this with hog farming in North Carolina, by a company that isn't even owned by the state, or our country for that matter.The Smell of Money begs the viewer to put ourselves in their shoes to see how we'd feel: how upset, angry, and powerless we'd feel to a company that is destroying our quality of live without caring one bit.This documentary pulls no punches when it comes to telling the truth of what's happening. It really makes us think if we want to continue supporting these industries with our dollar.",False

1,5,It appears the country is awash with celeb tourists being irritating....,ianlouisiana,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSoon they will have to invent a few new counties for them to drive round otherwise - heaven forfend - they might disappear from our screens in a fit of giggling inanely at their own jokes and trying desperately to find something fresh to say about Cornwall.This group of Poundland Palins have eaten enough sticks of rock,Yorkshire Puddings,and pasties of various ilks to sour me of them for ever.They run into other over - familiar celebs en route and they all go round the same old same old mulberrybush..
I have no wish to see the lost Gardens of PenBloodyHaligon again,OK?They can stay lost as far as I'm concerned.Let's have no more of Mr Brandreth and his annoying pullovers,Ms Toksvig and her annoying know - allness,Ms Humble and her ubiquity,the Dancing Queens from Strictly' whose egos know no bounds and now Ms Ayres whose muse has missed the last bus home.And don't get me started on young Master Fogle...
In short,this format is dead but refusing to lie down.Ms Calman does her jolly japes and wizard wheezes best but she can't give it the kiss of life .",True
2,1,Susan Calman's Grand Day Out,studioAT,n/a,15/08/2025,So Channel 5 can send Susan Calman (always endearing) around the country but they can't find a space in the schedules for a massive institution like 'Neighbours'.It really beggars belief.Can't Susan just go on a staycation without having to be filmed?,False
3,2,Scraping the barrel,alanfisher2001,n/a,15/08/2025,"I imagine BBC are thinking, what we need is yet another travel programme, who is available that we can put in it. They unfortunately chose Susan Calman, a presenter who's intensely irritating voice cuts through the air like nails on a blackboard. Thankfully , I can change the channel and seek peace. I am required of course to flesh out this review in order to reinforce the irritation that she can provoke upon hearing her dulcet screech emanating from the television. Having been conditioned to listening to the soothing tones of the ilk of Portillo, Fogle et al, I am spoilt in expecting 1. Auditory bearability, 2. Some actual experience of travel programmes.",False

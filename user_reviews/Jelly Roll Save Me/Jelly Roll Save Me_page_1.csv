1,8,Beautiful story,spronkcourtney,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI absolutely love this documentary. Learning more about Jelly Roll's beginnings, his struggles, the love between him and Bunny. The fact that they both realized they were toxic and needed to make changes, and did it? So. Much. Damn. Respect.I teared up so much listening to fans tell him how much his music has touched their lives because it touched him so much. Watching a grown man cry is a weakness of mine.One thing that stands out to me is Jelly Roll comparing a concert to going to church. I could not agree more with this. There is something so healing to be in a room/stadium/coliseum with hundreds/thousands of other fans singing to the same songs that mean something to you. I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it. It's such a beautiful thing.",True
2,8,A Heroic Rise From The Ashes Of Self-Destruction,geekhead,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jelly Roll has been through the ringer and found his way out of that whitewash. For that alone he deserves credit. His desire to help others climb out of that same hole he was once in, speaks to his nature and is part of what makes the documentary powerful.Yes, we create our own hells, and Jelly certainly doesn't hide from the fact he knows he created his. But the question is, do we have what it takes to rise up. I'm not sure (by his own admissions) if he is totally free of his demons, but he certainly has the tools and added opportunities success affords to get him all the way there, when or if that's needed.He has my support as he finds his way, helping others as he goes. And thanks for songs like ""Save Me"" and ""Kill A Man"" ... rock on Jelly.",False
3,10,Loved this. As for the other reviews THE HATE GOES ON!,mastiff-man,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had to edit my review just to say this, just like his something, people seem to have some jealousy issues haha. The hate goes on!! I have become a big fan of jelly roll because his music speaks to me in a way that only someone who has lived a life like I have can. It helps me remember that that at one time I was that ""same A-hole"" but every one can overcome their demons. This documentary takes you behind the scenes to show you why he is who he is and why his fans love him. The music, the tours, how he was raised and more are explored. Jelly Roll is truly inspiring in the fact that he owns up to his error but clearly want to be a better man for his kid, and his wife. This shows sheds a light on what a not just what a big talent this man is, but what an incredibly big heart he has. If you do not know about Jelly roll and his inspirational(understanding depression) music, this documentary gives you a great start and I am certain most people will come out being fans of the man if not his artistic work.",False

5,10,"Rating of this documentary = how much somebody ""gets it""",bcmhfrgcm,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you ""get it"" then you can appreciate what it takes to be a human with as much power in them as vulnerability. This is a beautiful story about a gold standard human and his journey. If you think you get it too, you should watch it. The scenes of the crowd at red rocks made tears stream down my face. He is a unicorn and this world is better for him being in it.If you don't get it, you'll criticize his struggle. You won't value the honesty, integrity, or human bandwidth it takes to get through the things he has. You think this is stupid if you don't know what's important. You think this is stupid if you haven't been through anything that's forced you to come out on the other side better for it.If people like the first reviewers are who ultimately shaped this man and made him who he is, we should be grateful for them. But man. What a waste of cells on judgmental idiots whose superiority is the only stupidity - they'd rather default to ""it's wrong"" or ""it's bad"" than to actually figure it out. If we built up more people like this man, this world would be better place by immeasurable bounds. Love to jelly roll and his people. You saved me too, brother.",False
6,3,Offensively stupid,bobzzzz,n/a,15/08/2025,"This guy is a real con artist. I can see how people might think he is an inspiration, at first. He doesn't have much to say, just the same old, ""Life did me wrong."" Quit the 8th or 9th grade, I can't remember which.I watched another interview with him, in which one of his party buddies does the question asking. Mostly what they talk about is doing acid and getting high and drinking. The saddest part is after listening to him for awhile, he makes things up. When he's asked a question, he has the habit of saying things like, ""Oh yeah, I did that, I know about that, or I was going to do that"" - classic BS stuff.The guy is not a hero. If you need a hero, look for a teacher or doctor, not this scam artist. He's laughing, all the way to the bank, at the people he's supposedly portraying. Folks, you're being had and laughed at by this clown and his management company.",False
7,1,Total fiction,paulhugojames,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dcoumentary films about musicians have always been self-congratulatory puff-pieces, but now that the corporate grip on commercial music production has closed so completely that it is impossible - rather than just very difficult - to ""make it"" without being the creation of a media PR machine (I am a musician, and know whereof I speak), a new sub-genre of music doc has emerged: namely transparent attempts to continue peddling the myth that the little guy can still make it big.This depiction of the man known as Jelly Roll is a virtual apotheosis of this concept: despite being admittedly ""too fat and ugly"" to be a star (which does actually literally mean that he would never be allowed to be one - this reality cannot be overcome), and a multiple jailbird, drunk, druggie, etc. Etc, he is described as having the most meteoric rise to stardom ever of a musician.The entire situation is so palpably manufactured and false that it beggars belief. ""We released a song on YouTube, and the next day we were performing in stadiums every night."" Yeah, right. The PR people can't even be bothered to ensure that the actor playing ""Jelly Roll"" stays in character throughout: his dialogue is far too sophisticated to be spoken by a 9th-grade drop-out, or whatever he is supposed to be. Even his ""good old boy"" accent keeps slipping, revealing glimpses of a much more educated way of speaking.Essentially, then, this film is the next level of the deliberate mocking of musicians at the bottom of the industry food chain (which is the only position that now exists, other than created global phenomenon: there is nothing in-between) by smug company lackeys who have arrogated all power unto themselves, and delight in rubbing everyone else's noses in this fact.",False

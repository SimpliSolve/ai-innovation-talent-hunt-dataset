1,3,Interesting story but poorly made documentary,chyobi,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was interested to learn about how a couple and homeless man scammed the public out of $400,000, and went into the documentary knowing little about the case. Unfortunately I can't say I feel like I learned a lot about the case from this documentary, as the documentary hardly seems to touch upon some of the most interesting things that arose as the scam unveiled. For example, (spoiled alert), the fact that Mark knew Johnny prior to the scam is mentioned briefly at the end of the documentary but little is explained further before the documentary abruptly ends. The outcome of the trial and sentencing of the scammers is randomly inserted in the documentary without any discussion about the trial itself or lead up to this conclusion. There are many interviews between people who seem only marginally connected to the story, and the framing and quality of the interview footage seems amateurish and inconsistent. The audio is arguably the worst part of the documentary. First, there's the jingling holiday music that plays throughout the documentary, which I guess is connected to the story because the scam occurred during the holidays? Then there's the background music that noticeably fades in and out as people talk. Its all very distracting and takes away from the serious nature of the documentary. You're better off just reading a news article about the scam, you'd learn way more and save an hour of your time.",True

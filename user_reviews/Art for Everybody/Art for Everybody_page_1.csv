1,10,Surprising and Incredible Story of Controversial Artist,RayMillsMedia,n/a,15/08/2025,"Whether you love the artist Thomas Kinkade or if you hated him, you will discover a side of him that you never knew existed, and it will surprise you and maybe even move you to compassion for him. This is an incredibly moving and honest documentary sans judgment that presents a very balanced view of the so-called Painter of Light. Thomas Kinkade is most definitely controversial in many, many ways, but the cooperation of his family in this film takes the story to levels that are surprising, sometimes shocking, but incredibly humanizing. This is easily one the best documentaries I have seen in years. Hopefully this will get picked up by one of the big streaming platforms and it will gain the wide audience it deserves.",False
2,10,Honest Story of a Complicated Family,stevenpaulsavage,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ms Yousef was given the honor of being the opening film of our local film festival in Birmingham AL (Sidewalk, called out at best director for Everything All at Once). And for full disclosure, I was able to talk personally with the filmmaker (an amazing benefit of attending film festivals).Art for Everyone is one of the cleanest documentaries I have seen in a long time. The way the filmmaker intertwines the stories of the wife and daughters mixed with art experts showed an intimacy that is difficult to capture.I felt invested in all of the commenters the filmmaker chose to include.No matter how you feel about the man's art, the film compels the audience to look beyond the product the artist was able to make.",False
3,10,Review from a Thomas Kinkade collector/dealer of 25 years,KarenD-25,n/a,15/08/2025,"While the Thomas Kinkade certainly had his flaws...a good and bad side- as all complex figures do - the movie's did focus on shortcomings and the negative which somehow missed the boat and how loved and admired his creations are. In choosing to highlight mostly the negative, the filmmakers missed an opportunity to present a fuller, more honest portrait that includes the good he produced alongside his flaws. True storytelling demands nuance, but this depiction leaned heavily toward critique without offering the necessary context or acknowledgment of his many contributions.As a dealer/collector for 25 years I feel I have a more 360 degree view :>>he captured the hearts of millions across generations.He remains the only artist in history commissioned by two major studios - Disney and Warner Brothers - to memorialize the spirit of their most beloved stories. Disney's ""Disney Dreams"" collection sold out immediately, while Warner Brothers commissioned him to capture the magic of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone with the Wind.""Beyond Hollywood, Elvis Presley Enterprises personally commissioned Kinkade to paint Graceland, preserving the legend of Elvis through his signature glowing light.Even the White House was graced with Kinkade's work when he presented his painting Lights of Liberty, and he mingled with not one, but two former U. S. Presidents: George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush.Kinkade's legacy reached beyond art galleries:He memorialized iconic moments like the 2002 World Series (Anaheim Angels vs. San Francisco Giants)He commemorated legendary venues like Yankee Stadium before it was rebuilt, Fenway Park, and even events like the Daytona 500.At the peak of his career, there were over 600 official Thomas Kinkade galleries across America.In 2003, he was named a National Spokesman for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, raising over $750,000 in just one year to grant wishes for children battling critical illnesses.By the mid-2000s, Thomas Kinkade Company sales topped over $4 billion, a testament to how deeply the public loved his work - regardless of what critics said.As a dealer and collector for 25 years, I witnessed firsthand the passion people had for his art.In just four days after his passing, I completed over half a million dollars in sales - not because people saw his art as a commodity, but because they felt his art in their hearts and wanted to hold a piece of him forever.And they still do today. Typical Email received hundreds of times over and over:Hi Karen,We were so delighted when we received 'The Cottage' yesterday! Absolutely beautiful! I told my wife it reminded me of her and our daughter picking flowers for arrangements in our own home . . . It brought tears of joy to both of us! It's truly amazing . . . It looks so much better and more impactful than photos . . . Thank you so much for thinking of us and making our dreams a reality!With love,

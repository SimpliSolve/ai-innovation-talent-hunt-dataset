1,6,"How to plan a ""perfect"" bank robbery",paul-allaer,n/a,17/08/2025,"As ""The Bank Robbers: The Last Great Heist"" (2022 release from Argentina; 109 min.) opens, we are in ""Buenos Aires, Argentina"", and we get to know a guy nicknamed ""The Artist"". He is one of the 4 who robbed Banco Rio in January, 2006 in Buenos Aires. The other three are nicknamed ""The Actor"", ""The Thug"" and ""The Engineer"". When asked why he did it, The Artist, the brainchild behind it all, says he had a revelation one day to rob a bank, and then took 2 years to plan it... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this documentary reflects on the ""robbery of the century"", the astounding amount of planning that went into it, and the aftermath. Please note that much of the documentary is simply letting the 4 main guys talk about it, and then re-enact what exactly they did. There is surprisingly little archive footage mixed into it, and that really holds the documentary back. I'm not a big fan of re-enactments in documentaries to begin with. Nevertheless, the amount of details that went into planning the heist is what held my interest. Then comes the last 25-30 minutes...""The Bank Robbers: The Last Great Heist"" premiered earlier this week on Netflix. If you are interested in true crime and in documentaries, even with all of the re-enactments, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
2,2,4 guys chatting about something,Xavier_Stone,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's really a rather simple documentary and doesn't really go into the robbery much at all. 2 years of planning and digging are summarized up in a few minutes. A little bit here, a bit there. It's hard to believe that these guys were the actual robbers. We met so and so, and he was a friend who knew something.If you have the actual guys who did the crime why aren't you getting good details and problems that they had. Such a good opportunity to get real inside information, but nope. Just a run of the mill everyday doc here. Might as well robbed a food truck.Ending is rather disappointing as well. This is a doc on how to under deliver. 2/10, nothing learned, check out Wikipedia for actual details of the crime. Sad.",True

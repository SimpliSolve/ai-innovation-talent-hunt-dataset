1,8,Last Man Standing (with help from the band),ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness (on the edge of town). What keeps a band together for decades? It could be the shared love of music ... although many bands have split up with members continuing on in solo careers. It could be a love of performing ... but again, a band isn't needed for that. It could be friendship or family ... lifelong friends Paul and John couldn't save The Beatles, and a brotherly feud broke up Creedence Clearwater Revival. Certainly ""luck"" plays a role ... too many deaths to count have caused the demise of bands through the years. Although no clear answer exists, it's likely a blend of all the above combined with a certain spiritual bonding. Nowhere is that more evident than with the E Street Band. Of course, the band has a dynamic leader in (the once shy) Bruce Springsteen, but it's obvious these musicians like and respect each other, and very much value what they have built together.Having been a Springsteen fan since the early 1970's, I can't possibly be overly objective towards Thom Zimny's documentary, so you've been warned. Zimny released THE BEACH BOYS documentary earlies this year, and he has a long-standing affiliation with Springsteen on music videos and other documentaries, including LETTER TO YOU (2020) and WESTERN STARS (2019). This latest is centered on the band's 2023 tour, their first in six years and first since the pandemic. However, rather than a traditional concert flick, Zimny takes us behind the scenes for the band's reunion, early rehearsals, and process while on the road. Most insightful are the musings from the individual band members, while Bruce's narration provides some structure to the film.Bruce kicks us off by recalling that as a kid, he dreamed of playing music in front of screaming fans. It's hard to imagine his dreams were ever as big as the reality he's living. What inspired this documentary was his promise that when the pandemic ended, he'd throw ""a big party"". That's what led to the E Street Band's reunion for their first tour in six years. We learn bits and pieces of history as it pertains to how the band came together, and though the rehearsal time is short, Bruce explains his goals are to ""shake the dust off the band"" and establish the playlist for the tour. While it's only hinted at a few times, it seems clear that his run on Broadway influenced the vision he had for this tour.Opening night in Tampa is as exciting for the band as it is for the fans. A recurring theme for this film is the crowd shots - often close-ups of fans and their emotional reaction (tears flow freely). We can't help but view this as spiritual for so many - the Church of E Street, if you will. Bruce is crystal clear in his desire to tell a story with the show; a story long-time manager Jon Landau describes as 'living life now'. The show pays tribute to bandmembers lost - Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici, and Bruce's wife and bandmate Patty Scialfa briefly discusses the health scare that has her cautiously participating in shows whenever possible.One of the highlights is the anticipation of the tour arriving in Barcelona. Whatever you've heard about the crowds in Europe, what we witness goes even beyond. These fans remind me so much of those early days as they express their pure appreciation and raw emotion driven by the music. Another aspect that becomes obvious as the tour progresses is that, despite being a huge band on stage, the E Street Band is remarkably talented and incredibly tight musically. This entertainment spectacle is first and foremost a musical gem, and Steve Van Zandt (as Musical Director) probably doesn't receive the recognition he deserves from the fans for his attention to musical details.The segment on the cover of ""Nightshift"" is particularly telling on how things come together for both the music and the stage presentation. It's noted that the song has turned into a 'showstopper' on tour and the film makes it obvious why. Insights from band members throughout the film infer a blended magic with influences of Jazz, R & B, Soul, and Jazz, and the music provides the proof. Piano work from Professor Roy Bittan and sax work from Clarence's nephew Jake cover multiple styles, and when the band cuts loose, rock music has rarely been better. The film leaves us with a bit of uncertainty. Alone on stage with his acoustic guitar, Bruce (now 75 years old) sings ""Last Man Standing"" (noting the recent passing of George Theiss leaves Bruce as the only survivor of his original band, The Castiles). As narrator he refers to ""yesterdays and goodbyes"", and then proclaims he'll continue ""until the wheels come off."" If it's his goodbye, the legacy spans over 50 years. If the wheels stay on, we'll chomp at the bit to see what the Boss brings us next.Premieres on Hulu and Disney+ on October 25, 2024.",False
2,9,To short,aldohitz,n/a,16/08/2025,"As with Wings of Wheels, Springsteen On Broadway, Western Stars and Letter To You, Thom Zimny's latest work is convincing from A to Z.The highlights are the insight into the inner life of the band on the one hand and the emotions of the audience at the concerts on the other.The perfect interplay between the individual musicians is impressively demonstrated to the viewer, especially in the sequence of ""Kitty's Back"".The only thing I criticize about this film is the length. Only 100 minutes for an E-Street movie...you can't be serious man!!!Other than that...tears, goose bumps, laughter, ass shaking and biiiig gratitude that I've been able to see the maestro and his band live so many times.BRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCE!!!!",False
3,9,Moving,giorgiowalnut,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been listening to Bruce's music since 1983... after so long and after all the energy he has transferred to all of us, you end up thinking that he is immortal!Hard to think about any other artist that can relate to his fans in the same way Bruce does. His concerts are a total experience, band and fans are united in one soul.This documentary is a hymn to the joy of music. But it is also a statement that sooner or later all this will end; that it cannot last forever.. that mortality is round the corner... and for that reason, the film is even more emotional and moving. Long life to Bruce, long life to rock and roll!",False
4,10,I'll see you in my dreams,robinladams,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDear Bruce, this was a love letter from your soul. Once of the best music documentaries I've ever seen, and I've seen Bruce live four times, but this moved me like no other live show. I hope he tours until the wheels come off. Beautifully filmed, sincere and heartfelt in every way. The enduring friendships, loose collaborations and the freedom to be yourself is present in every single band member. I was moved to tears and a smile grew from ear to ear with each song, each camera shot of adoring fans and the tenderness of Bruce and Patti singing Fire! Thank you Bruce for the decades of love and unwavering commitment to please your fans!",True

1,10,Wonderful documentary addressing the current divide in America,rfmil9698,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unlike some other reviews I found Stars and Strife to be an even handed look at the current political, economic and cultural divide in America. Not just that, but the extent of interviews was a wealth of information to help address how the U.S. can improve moving forward. I did not expect to like the documentary, much less any current documentary involving political questions, but I was very impressed with how fast the time went- all while learning new points of view. Bravo, and everyone should give this a watch.",False
2,10,good look into a bipartisan solution,tashascookietreats,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, this video does show the good of BLM, hence the whole point of the video is to bring Americans closer together. Just because some people in BLM have been extreme does not mean that the movement doesnt have any valid points. Now, I am a Trump supporter and believe Deep state has been shutting down the voices of rightwing conservatives and I am 100% against any type of censorship. I
also, at the same time believe this video very interesting and hear the message our politics need to be more center. The Doc also breaks down the difference between good capitalism and what some of the big elites are doing which is destroying our world. I personally do not see this as a left movie but a great center and idea that we do need to work more at getting rid of the extreme left and extreme right. Now many Democrats I know hate Republicans because lets face it they can be a bit cold-hearted and extreme right. Just the same on the right who hate socialism, this movie is more centered and I really enjoyed the talking points on moving center and working together for unity and peace. highly recommend watching even if you don't agree with it.",False

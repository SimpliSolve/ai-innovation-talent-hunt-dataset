1,2,Poor AI filled imagery can't save this,cquesadaanim,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really love a good horror story, specially where is based in real life events. But I can't get past the sheer amount of AI images that fill the narration. Considering that these stories were rooted in real life stories, there is a trove of factual material, including photos and newspaper articles that could've been used to support this documentary, and yet the director decided to go with poorly made AI, 14-fingers, ballooning-head humans and overall anatomically incorrect support documentation. It's a huge turn off.The voice over also needs more articulation, I needed to turn subtitles to understand what was being said.Very mildly entertainment value, just please stop forcing AI into a creative field.",False
2,3,A very pedestrian but mildly interesting walk through locations made famous by horror,C_R_Saxby,n/a,16/08/2025,"A low-caliber, uncreative, cookie-cutter effort with WERY low production value, 'True American Horror' takes the lazy documentarian's way out - all too commonplace on freebie streaming services - by combining some very common, very uninspiring visuals pulled from the internet/YouTube with a narrative voiceover explaining the relationship between real-life locations and literary or cinematic horror stories. True: some of the pictures displayed and stories told are interesting, but one could accomplish nearly the same goal by performing a few Wikipedia and Google Image searches.If you literally want something that's pure description; something that has no complicated nuance and doesn't make you think thrown on for background noise, hit play. Otherwise, those with more high-brow expectations will be sorely disappointed.",False

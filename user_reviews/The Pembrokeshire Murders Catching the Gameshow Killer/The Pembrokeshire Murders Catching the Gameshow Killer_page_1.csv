1,8,A fascinating documentary.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wanted to have a bit of a break before watching this, so that I wasn't only thinking of the terrific adaptation.It's a very interesting, very factual drama, the events surrounding the case of John Cooper make you realise just how good the drama was, and how they tried to stick very much to the story.Interesting to see the faces of the real people that put the man away. Jonathan Hill's input was great, and that Bullseye footage was fascinating.The footage of the interviews is startling. You realise what a true monster the man is.Very interesting to watch. 8/10.",False

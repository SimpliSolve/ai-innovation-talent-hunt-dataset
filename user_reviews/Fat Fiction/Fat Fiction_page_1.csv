1,9,Modern Chronic Disease is a result of Nutrition mistakes since the introduction of the Dietary Guideliness,amandazz100,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentaty shows clearly how the key to regaining health is to ignore the current dietary guidelines and instead adopt a Whole Food Animal (and Plant) based diet. This diet is one which will stop blood sugars spiking and allow the recovery of metabolic health.The documentary is a well organised, evidence based documentary which includes real examples of the impact of eating the current recommended diet on healthy individuals not just those suffering from metabolic illness and introduces you to many experts who can help you to understand the issues. .There is a steadily increasing cohort of private individuals regaining health ( and maintaining health) by following the recommendations outlined in this documentary. Anyone who wants to live a long healthy life, should watch the documentary and then follow the same actions as some of those in the documentary and take a large black bag to a great deal .of the contents of their larder/ fridge..For anyone spending time at home, wondering how to optimise their chances of withstanding Corona Virus, you could usefully watch the documentary, follow up the interviews given by reading the evidence yourself and make a start on recovering your own metabolic health. Poor metabolic health has already been implicated in the Corona Virus deaths. This is a must watch, take it seriously - I am speaking as a severe diabetic (Hba1C 10.3% on diagnosis) now with normal blood sugars at 5.3% a with no medications and regained metabolic health for the last two years because I practise what this documentary tells us.If you yourself, or your family suffer from any of the conditions of modern civilisation ( eg, diabetes, alzheimers, heart disease, stroke, cancer and many others ) then you owe it to yourself to understand the extent to which FOOD is MEDICINE and what you eat is the difference between eating yourself ill or keeping yourself healthy. This documentary is a great introductory start to that process. A MUST WATCH. .",True
2,7,I Prescribe...,Xstal,n/a,16/08/2025,"... olive oil, avocado and walnut smoothies to start; pork crackling, lardons and black pudding for main; followed by sugar free dripping ice cream - washed down with a bottle of Thunderbird Red, or Blue if it's the weekend.Fat does not make you fat, this has been acknowledged for some time now, as has the the role of the corrupt sugar mafia - no harm in re-amplifying that, and it's welcome. The fact is that when you shuffle, the world will still be no wiser to what's good for you than the hunter-gatherer that set the standard some time ago.",False
3,7,A good first step but...,LukeCustomer2,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is all about how the current nutrition guidelines are 100% wrong and are causing most of America to be fat and have diabetes. All of your favorite doctors are here.. all talking about how the government has, and continues to, tell you the exact wrong information and how many diabetics are getting sicker daily. It is a horrible scandal. I only hope one or two people see this and are saved by it.There is, one problem, however, I think whomever directed this chose to make it a broad, low science based documentary. This of course, is not great for the position as it leaves it open to attack. There is tons of science backing Keto (mostly from the military) - that science should have been used. This thing should have been science study after science study.I also think they made a mistake with not showing the results and instead doing a continuous glucose monitor example. Sure that was a short and easy way -- but not very persuasive. I know for a fact hundreds of people have used Keto to restore good health and lose weight so just taking a little more time to highlight them would have made for a better documentary.Anyone who watches this and would like to know more should look this doctors up on ""You tube"" where they are featured in much more science heavy presentations.",False
4,10,Watch your way to better health,pchristou,n/a,16/08/2025,"In 50 years, this documentary will be considered the gold standard in how to reverse diabetes and ensure good health. I have tried it myself and have lost weight and it has helped my daily headaches tremendously. I am not ravenously hungry anymore and quit snacking almost entirely due to eating more fat. An easy way to incorporate fat is eating avocados, eggs & coconut chips for a snack. Look, go moderate carb and SEE HOW YOU FEEL. Than, start going low carb if you feel better. Only thing missing from this documentary is mentioning reducing gluten & dairy intake which contribute to headaches and other digestive issues. Also, ditch the sugar - it does nothing for you and fuels chronic conditions. I wish you all the best of luck.",False
5,10,"As a trained Chef, I had to change my whole mindset.",ricardobasjan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been a cook for 18 years. I was taught that the Food Pyramid is our guide for cooking healthy cooking. We have turned people into junkies, craving sugar and Carbohydrates. Thank you for making this documentary.",False
6,10,This movie may change you life - to the better,petercarlsson-92297,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a fantastic documentary.
The facts that it contain show the real truth about food, sugar and fat.
Please watch this movie - it may change your life - to the better. It did for me.
You will find out that most people are stuffing themself full of sugar - in many cases without even knowing or thinking about it. And that is like taking poison for the body.
The doc also show the shady business that's going on among the people that have recommended a dangerous diet for decades, hurting and killing people in the long run by doing so.",False
7,9,A must watch!,craigahrens,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought I was well informed in this area but I quickly realized early on, I've been kidding myself. What an enlightening documentary. I thought I had a handle on a healthy diet! Wrong! This is thanks to years of brainwashing me, us, what they want us to believe what's a healthy diet. I liked how the information was presented. Not preachy and easy to follow, to understand. I walked away much better informed and know where I'll be making some changes in my diet! Bravo, well done folks!!",False
8,n/a,Long winded,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was familiar already with the topic at hand and the research behind it is as sound as nutritional studies can get(which is not a lot). The real issue is how the documentary was presented, it was like it spent too much time beating around the bush, going in circles and repeating points. It also did not help that at times it went for smug analogies to sway opinions( how many times you had orange juice in the last year?... and so on). I dont know what was the intention of the documentary but what i know is that you either try to be accessible and resonate with the masses or you are diligent and accurate. In the end it feels like this one kind of failed at both. Not really recommended, there are 10 minutes videos on youtube who convey the same amount of information",False
9,6,Nothing new here,firebird7478-223-619790,n/a,16/08/2025,"So many different documentaries about the same subject have been coming out since 2009 or so. Same cast of characters telling us the same thing. While I highly respect these people and hold them in high regard, there isn't anything here that I didn't learn in the 5-6 previous docs on Low-Carb/high fat or keto.And for the record, I followed the same principles in this documentary starting in 2008. I was 178 lbs at the time. I got to as low as 171. Since then, my weight has shot up to as high as 205 with a high percentage of bodyfat and has settled to a BW in the low-mid 190s.It doesn't work for everyone.",False
10,10,A documentary that nails the obesity problem.,jmdns,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fat Fiction explains, in detail, how money from big food companies and big pharma has been used to steer us away from healthy eating. Their goals have been to increase profits but they are doing it at the risk of us having a heart attack or developing diabetes and becoming obese. We have substituted high carbs food for more healthy food and the food industry is behind the whole idea. This documentary shows you how they did it and the faulty studies that made us believe the lies.",False
11,9,Watch and be informed. And be heathy,williamgway,n/a,16/08/2025,A great piece of storytelling that let's us know what we are told as truths often are not. This film helps us to decipher what is truly healthy and what is non-science propaganda. It informs us and give us the information to make a informed choice.Finding the truth will set you free and make you healthier in the process. Watch this and be informed.,False
12,1,Big fat lie!,mastune,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a load of rubbish! This obsession with macro nutrition (fat/carbs) is the problem. Best advice is Whole Foods, mostly plants! In other words, food high in fiber and low in refined/processed/animal based. Live happily ever after. The end.",False
13,9,"Insightful, interesting, documentary about nutrition and your health",lbruhnca,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentaries are the real media. Doc filmmakers have time and time again become whistle-blowers on big money control over the general public. Jennifer highlights in this doc some compelling facts and insights about what we've been told about ""low-fat"" and ""healthy"" diets. An educational watch to enlighten us about obesity, and diets, who's and what big money is behind this huge industry. Everyone should watch this film.",False
14,10,Must See Movie If You Want To Improve Your Health,ccarter-40422,n/a,16/08/2025,"This thought provoking film should be seen by everyone wanting to improve their health. What a great researched and well written film! I really appreciated the detailed explanations of how an alternative way of eating the right foods could have such a positive and powerful impact on people's lives. It's not often a film can move me to make a lifestyle change but after seeing Fat Fiction, I am embarking on a lifestyle change to curb my intake of sugar and carbohydrates. If you know anyone who is pre-diabetic, has Type 2 diabetes or just want to lose some weight and get all the health benefits that come from dropping a few pounds, encourage them to watch this film.",False
15,n/a,"8-10 star reviews are fake single use accounts, this is 30 year old story and not news",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, this could have been done in a one minute short. This documentary views more like a long winded repetitive advertisement for the junk books the interviewees have written. It also makes several misrepresentations of the science (eg nina ticholtz airheaded claims).
We have known and it has been widely reported for DECADES that it is not fat per se, but type of fats. It is over 30 years since the science, the prestige press and the popular press has noted that for example margarine is unhealthy compared to other fats.
skip this mindless nonsense and spend two minutes at mayo clinic website article on healthy eating and dietary fat. You will learn ten times more than you will learn in this repetitive, longwinded promotional ""documentary.""",False
16,10,"Extremely informative re: history, politics, and $$ involved in the dietary guidelines",tannerb,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film! As a physician assistant working in emergency rooms, I constantly see the devastating effects of diabetes and obesity. It has becomes increasingly obviously over the years that the prescription for patients with high blood sugar (and high insulin, of course) should not be more carbs in their food, but less.This film does an excellent job of walking us through the history of how the ""low fat diet"" became part of the dietary guidelines, how it gradually became more entrenched, and why it's difficult for anything to change despite a growing body of evidence that these guidelines are harmful.The filmmakers did a good job of weaving together info about history with modern-day illustrations of the difference between low fat and low carb diets. They also did a good job of explaining the physiology behind what they were talking about.I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who values their own health!",False
17,9,Excellent Documentary,truthseeker-81678,n/a,16/08/2025,"Please ignore the fools claiming this documentary is inaccurate. I was already aware of all of this well researched information. I was nearly dead from undiagnosed type 2 diabetes just a few years ago. I had issues most of my life that no doctor could explain. I have been educated since my 20's about nutrition and natural medicine, yet I too had been fooled by the food and drug industries, and governments lies. The issues/complications are gone along with the diabetes. I educated myself, took no drugs, corrected my diet and eating habits, and feel at least 20 years younger. BTW all you plant only eaters, you can still eat just plants if you want, just realize that everything that causes type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease cholesterol problems, all are caused from eating the wrong plants, not from meat.",False
18,10,Outstanding ! As shocking as the Tobacco cover up NOT TO BE MISSED !!,goody-42341,n/a,16/08/2025,"An informative and shocking documentary that proves , once again, that big business and the US government cannot be trusted and they care little for the general population. Possibly more people will have been killed by the crooked sugar industry and those in the research industry paid to hide the truth, than even the criminals running the tobacco industry.
The facts are a truth hidden in plain sight. The makers of this documentary should be applauded for shining a light on a sleazy part of the food industry and a government too self interested to protect the general public.
A must see for everyone as this could ultimately save your life !",False
19,8,Is the USDA nutrition guide making us sick?,wnorman-21218,n/a,16/08/2025,"Low carbohydrate diets for weight loss are well established in literature starting with William Banting's ""Letter on Corpulence"" from 1864, and have been part of popular diet culture since ""Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution"" was published in 1972. However, this way of eating has been vilified as harmful by health advocacy organizations, mainstream academia, the USDA, and others who subscribe to Ancel Keys' Diet Heart Hypothesis established in the 1950s.This documentary gathers together several of the leading voices pushing back against the guidelines codified with the USDA Food Pyramid and continuing to this day with My Plate. Americans have been told that fat, particularly saturated fat, is unhealthy and the majority of the macro-nutrient we consume should be carbohydrate based. This documentary explores if the mainstream narrative has made us healthier or not.Physicians, including Robert Atkins, have been reversing type II diabetes in their practices for decades, but he never conducted any clinical trials. Since then, clinical trials have been conducted on diet and type II diabetes, including one by Dr. Sarah Hallberg detailed about midway through this documentary.The documentary also delves into the results from the Minnesota Coronary study that was conducted from 1968 until 1973 but the results went unpublished until 2016. Why would such a study be buried?This documentary includes a two week experiment with three healthy adults eating low carb for one week followed by low fat, and monitor health markers, including a continuous glucose monitor. They also interview the subjects to see how they feel throughout the experiment.The usage of industrial seed oils vs natural fats is explored, but not fully fleshed out. Apparently more studies are needed on this topic. Similarly, the role of cholesterol in cellular repair is mentioned, but only briefly.Documentaries about health and nutrition ALWAYS have personal anecdotes from those who have tried various eating approaches, and this one is no exception. We hear from folks who were obese, diabetic, and even an army helicopter pilot, and his experience with military rations that are based on USDA guidelines.Despite exploring some dark topics with regard to health, there are certainly uplifting moments in this documentary, including a ""light at the end of the tunnel"" with regard to a change in recommendations from an advocacy group.One star deducted for avoiding discussion of Dr. Robert Atkins, who was a pioneer in both weight loss and Type II diabetes reversal using a low carb approach, and took the brunt of the abuse from the Diet-Heart hypothesis crowd, even having his medical license jeopardized. Instead they focused on the Tim Noakes trial.One star deducted for the lack of humor. Yes, there is inclusion of a brief South Park clip, but in 2009, Tom Naughton brought up several of the same topics in his funny documentary ""Fat Head"", but Mr. Naughton and his excellent work is never referenced in ""Fat Fiction"".",False
20,3,Infomercial,willrenegar,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerVery narrow-minded long-form infomercial for ""Keto cures diabetes."" No discussion of other types of diets, or other diseases. I have no doubt that sugars and carbs in excess is bad for you and there's definitely evidence that restricting their intake can be beneficial to not only diabetes, but also cancer. But there's no mention of cancer and there's no mention of the evidence that shows that eating animal based products in excess can also be detrimental to your health as they push you to, eat more meat. It just feels more like they'r trying to sell you a very specific product rather than give you important information.",True
21,8,that was hard to watch,ayamisr,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went to a lot of doctors in my life for my weight and guess what, they all recommended the same low fat high carb diet, and guess what, none of what they suggested work. Keep in mind that I'm an Egyptian for Cairo, my country's national dish, the Koshary, is carbs on top of carbs and I love it. But all the time I craved fat, all the time I wanted to eat eggs for breakfast, I was told that I needed to resist that while in fact my body was telling me what it needed, so here I am, rethinking my relationship with food.The two missing stars is because the film didn't account for the psychological side to eating and weight, or for the difference of effects across genders.",False
22,3,"Yes, it's widely known from over a decade that ''fats are bad for you'' was political, but...",simog-73156,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can't refute the basic fact: fat was demonized by the AHA, for clear lobbyist reasons. The main study that claimed fat was bad for you, was intentionally flawed: the author removed all countries in the chart that did not support the narrative (for instance, they removed chile and other south american countries, that had a very low fat, yet very high cardiovascular disease rate. They removed Norway and Japan, that consume a lot of fat but have lower cardiovascular disease... this was intentional).
With that said, the rest of the documentary is rather bland. Either it's things we should all already know (There is no red meat study that proves it is bad, period. you should know that. The most they have is very vague non-clinical studies).
Also, no real scientists. Just a bunch of quacks, like the master-of-all quacks jason fung and Robert Lustig, another big quack in the business. They both say some easy truths, then divert to huge misconceptions/misunderstanding, and use the trust they gained from the audience to sell their story. In fung's case, to sell his treatments. Feel free to search online, the evidence that they're quacks is irrefutable (if your common sense doesn't drive you to that conclusion already).
Most of the rest in the documentary is covered by journlalists and superifical anectodes.. and yes, there is some truth, but overall nothing worth watching. Unless you were completely unaware of the decades old news: fat is actually good for you. All the most nutritious stuff, vitamins, nutrients of many types, are found in fat. In which case that last sentence alone suffices. Don't listen to quacks, don't follow quacks.
Easy way to spot quacks: quacks source other quacks. You will never see a real doctor have a discussion with fung or lustig. But, as you may well see, you can find them often in the same circles of quackery.",False

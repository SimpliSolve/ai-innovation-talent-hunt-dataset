1,8,Brings an Important Topic to Light,tmccray,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a high quality production with an easy to follow narrative weaving the connective lines between food and water scarcity and those seeking to control it.Perhaps one of the reasons that I was so engaged, is because unbeknowst to me before I watched it, a large portion of the story focuses on an issue in my state that I'm very well aware of. Our former Republican governor approved a foreign company to farm land and use unlimited water for free, and send the product back to their home country. This is one of the reasons he was voted out of office. The new Democratic governor cancelled their contract, but in the ensuing years, the foreign country drained the aquifer empty. Amusingly, in the epilogue, Nathan takes credit for the cancellation, without mentioning the change of political power. Everyone in the state was well aware of what happened, it was extensively reported.It's a reminder to stay politically aware of the politicians that are aligned with corporations and foreign governments who are selling our food and water security away.",False
2,8,Puts a spotlight on an important topic,spmact,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had no idea many of the things that this documentary shows were happening. I think many people wold do the same.That is why this needs to be seen by more people. There are forces at work that want to remain undetected and do their work behind the scenes, but this doc exposes some of what's happening, and lets you know the plight of many people around the world suffering because of wealthy and powerful people trying to take advantage of them and their resources.This is exactly the type of documentary I used to watch more of about 10 or 15 years ago, before many of them became political or had an obvious political agenda. This is more about showing you something that's happening in the world so you can educate yourself and do something about it. I'm glad I watched it.",False
3,6,Fails to connect the dots,fung0,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary tries valiantly to be some kind of vast doomsday revelation. But by spreading itself too thin, and leaping from one flimsy point to another, it fails to come up with enough specifics, or even a coherent thesis, that would make its 1hr 45min run time feel worthwhile.""The problem isn't countries or people trying to secure their food supply, the problem is how,"" journalist (and star of the film) Nathan Halverson sums up the premise. ""They"" are grabbing other people's land, sucking aquifers dry. It's a good premise for a documentary. Unfortunately, The Grab is not that documentary. It's based entirely on anecdotes and sweeping quotes from various interested parties - all very loosely connected by narration from Halverson.""What if... instead of grass,we use bacteria? And instead of cows, we use fungi?"" Sure - what if? What if the filmmakers had stuck to their main point, about the global 'land grab' and left bio-engineering for another time? The Grab consists almost entirely of such half-hearted digressions.Worst is all the time spent talking about Erik Prince, founder of the Blackwater mercenary group. The reporters in the film seem particularly proud of a dump of emails - colorfully referred to as The Trove - which ultimately yields no revelation other than the name of Prince's Chinese employer. ""We expect these emails are gonna become a playbook for how people are looking to grab up food and water,"" says Halverson. But that connection is never strongly enough to justify the time spent on Prince.World food prices are soaring! Yes, this is worrying. But are they soaring because of factors such as Russia reducing its wheat exports - or because the few companies that control global food markets are exercising unrestrained monopolistic power? Who does control the world food markets? Dunno. But, but... Russia is raising cattle! Worse... they're hiring *American* cowboys to do it! Well, *an* American cowboy - we're given only one example (including some nice footage of a Russian rodeo). If you're hoping to find out how Russian beef production has grown over the years, look elsewhere.Security experts are apparently worried about ""the possibility of Russia using its food supply as a weapon."" The film doesn't specify in what way this would be a departure from the status quo in global markets. Every country seeks the best deal, uses its unique resources for leverage. Is Russia especially bad in this regard? No idea. But, but... global warming will thaw the Russian north and open a huge new potential for control of food supplies! Okay... but is melted tundra the same thing as rich prairie farmland? Probably not even close. Another big pronouncement backed by zero science and no expert comment.China is making food security for its population a high priority. Okay, that's interesting. There's even a snippet of interesting historical background - the fact that a US embargo contributed to the great Chinese famine in the late 1950s. But the Chinese move is presented as if somehow sinister... and again, there are no statistics, no details of various national policies. Much later, Halverson acknowledges that Western countries ought to do the same. But there's no background on existing national policies, in China or anywhere else.The Grab is nicely produced, and raises some important issues. It's even thought-provoking at times. But it fails to provide solid information or deep perspective. If you want to know about our food supply, watch Food Inc. 1 and the recent Food Inc. 2. If you want to learn about the geopolitics of natural resources, there are many better sources than The Grab.",True
4,9,Highly recommended - an important film,gtrvoc,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have long contended that food and water will be the next global battleground. And it's happening right now before our eyes.Lots of detail, lots of irrefutable evidence that this is taking place. Reading some of the reviews I wonder if those reviewers had actually watched the same film that I did.I have recommended The Gran to friends.This is important stuff that has a huge bearing on the geopolitical landscapeIt doesn't surprise me on bit that Putin's actions in Ukraine both in 2014 and more recently are aimed at securing control over the ownership of wheat production from which he can leverage power as the Saudis et al do with OPEC.Yes it does join the dots.American land is being bought up by China and Russia. People crossing the border illegally aren't the problem but this land acquisition is part of a much bigger problem.Watch the film!!",True
5,10,Amazing Doc! :),TruthPhoenix,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an amazing documentary. The courage that the journalists have in tackling this subject, deserves respect.Once you see this all the way through, then you begin to put some of the pieces together as far as what is happening globally.Remember when the Americans attacked Iraq and everyone said that they were just doing it for the oil? Well 20 or 30 years on now, what are the reasons for war these days? Think about the real reasons why Russia, China and Iran are being so destabilizing. And why don't ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox news report on the these issues?Ultimately the motivations of those in power is to first maintain that power and second try to gain more power.That is why we need real journalists and that is also why some rich people spend so much effort trying to discredit real journalists by calling them fake news etc.Sunlight is the best antiseptic, so let's drag the truth into the light. ;)",False
6,6,"A Challenge To Pull Off, Despite Good Intentions",brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sometimes a story is so big and involved that it's difficult to get a handle on it. That can be quite a challenge for even the most adept documentarians and investigative reporters, no matter how eager or adept they may be in taking on such an ambitious project. And that, unfortunately, is the case with the latest offering from director Gabriela Cowperthwaite in her eight-year-long collaboration with journalist Nathan Halverson of The Center for Investigative Reporting. In essence, the film seeks to identify and characterize the new flashpoints underlying emerging geopolitical conflicts. Just as those in recent years have been driven by the compulsion to secure valuable energy supplies, today's budding battlegrounds are once again tied to acquiring access to precious resources - in this case, food and water, along with the aquifers, agricultural land and processing facilities needed to yield these commodities. Evidence of the desperate, growing need for obtaining these materials has already begun to surface - albeit not always overtly - in such incidents as the Arab Spring and even the War in Ukraine. And, because of this developing crisis, those interested in locking down these resources have started scrambling to acquire them, primarily clandestinely, in regions where they're most plentiful. These efforts have been spearheaded by multinational corporations and global financial institutions in cooperation with countries that are experiencing, or have historically experienced, critical food and water shortages, such as China, Russia, Venezuela and the nations of the Middle East. And, to help ensure the success of these ventures, they have enlisted the support of mercenary muscle to achieve their goals. High-profile targets, primarily in Africa and even parts of the US, have come under growing scrutiny, unscrupulously grabbed from their rightful owners and leaving them destitute as a result. Needless to say, this is an incredibly complicated story, one that's difficult to tell, and, regrettably, that's somewhat apparent in the finished product. While the work of Cowperthwaite and Halverson is undoubtedly sincere, having brought a great deal of previously buried information to light, it's nearly impossible to relate this complex narrative in a concise and coherent manner. Given the many story threads involved and the well-camouflaged structures that have been set up to keep the truth and its principal participants concealed, it's a genuine challenge to intelligibly expose the overarching nature of this highly convoluted big picture. Some elements are thus underdeveloped or left incomplete, making this film an often-frustrating watch. That's unfortunate considering the importance of this story, one that has been largely flying below the radar and certainly deserves to be more widely exposed and detailed. With that said, though, ""The Grab"" represents a valuable start, and one can only hope there will be more releases like this that manage to dig deeper and discover more. It's also heartening that the picture addresses some of the victories that have come about in combatting this issue, particularly those that have benefitted Africans who have been subjected to what is essentially a new form of continental colonization. In an age where increasing social and political volatility is arising due to a failure to effectively address the world's hunger, it's essential that we become aware of this issue before it gets out of hand and leads us down a path we don't dare pursue.",False
7,2,Erm well...,Graffitiwidow,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being told this had something related to Blackfish made me think this doc must have some weight. 10 mins in I thought I was missing something. 20mins in I thought I just hadn't quite slotted in to the information being presented. 30 mins in I realise they are presenting a lot of information like a graph, with no explanation of why it is going up or down and what the x or y is. 40 mins in I'm thinking why I have wasted 40mins of my life. I don't even know what this film is trying to tell me because it's so bad. This thing over here is a thing but another thing is doing this and that thing has recorded it. So water is really important but we don't have any. I even tried getting stoned halfway through to see if it made more sense but it didn't. And now I'm 2 hours older.",False
8,3,"Documentary about the journalists, not about the subject",siggyatstage,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was super interested in this documentary, trailer came across my feed and it looked interesting. Unfortunately, with so many documentaries of late, it feels more about the journalists then the subject itself. They claim it was 6 years in the making...... yet it is seriously devoid of factual information being presented in a logical matter. They act like they found something super secretive, but this has been going on for the better part of 2 decades. So, anybody who is interested in this subject won't come out of it with much new information, knowledge or what to do about it. It's basically an investigative journey into water and food security, loosely pointing to possible connections with the subject of land grabs in Africa and even Russia's war in/with Ukraine.It's not really a 'grab', since it seems most things are legal and things that are deemed illegal are seemingly 'fixed', at least according to their own documentary.The biggest part that is obviously missing in any 'food/water scarcity documentary' is the technology that is relevant to solve this whole issue. It's not even touched up. Hydroponics, aquaponics etc etc, yes still long off for producing calorie-crops for the masses, but I'm sure all the 'villains' in this documentary are also investing in these technologies as a hedge.In the end it seems more like a bunch of naive journalists knowing nothing about the subject having a revelation that is not a revelation at all.",True
9,4,The hypocrisy is staggering.,roryontour,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to spend an hour and 42 minutes listening to Americans being shocked by capitalism this could be for you. The problem is that these Americans are only really being listen to in this case because it is foreigners doing capitalism to them for once instead of the other way around, which has been the norm for the last 75 years. The whole thing stinks of hypocrisy considering America has forced open markets and its own brand of fake globalism on the rest of the world for 75 years but now when the world does it back to America it has to be painted as something sinister. Of course it is incredibly sinister. Capitalism is one of the major roots of all Modern evil. But to be fine with it when it's American capital sucking the lifeblood from the rest of the world but then to suddenly develop a conscience when it's foreign capital sucking the lifeblood from America, seems beyond hypocritical and as a result the narrative just doesn't hold.",False
10,2,"Educational Doc ""The Grab"" Fails to Entertain",criticcoleman-37694,n/a,16/08/2025,"A recent problem that has been created by the multitude of generic flavored Netflix and Amazon Prime docs is that flair and panache have gone MIA. In seeking out truths and exposing unflattering wares, filmmakers of today seemed to have forgotten there are two equal and important parts when making a successful documentary - education AND entertainment. Not that Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite isn't one to provide stark reveals (she was behind the ever-so-effective ""Blackfish""), but in the case of her latest ""The Grab"" it simply boils down to being boring. There's so much info, so much minutiae and so much dark detail that there's simply no room for audience engagement. So while it's fascinating to see previously unknown info about why Russia invaded Ukraine (not surprised in the slightest) and joyous to expose those who use the weak and unknowing for their own enrichment simply because they can (up yours Erik Prince!), without a sense of style to elevate such a big bevy of important material nobody is going to see this film. Presenting a lesson of hard and cold facts are only half the course - it's the ability to also grab the audience's attention that's absent from this class.",False

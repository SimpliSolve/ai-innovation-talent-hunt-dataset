1,9,Enjoyable even for the Shenmue fan who feels like they know it all,dogeymon,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Shenmue games were revolutionary for the time and were so fascinating and touching to gamers everywhere that it's hard to not want to know more about their history. All Shenmue fans knows what it's like to Google this game for decades. Mostly just wondering when the third game was going to come out.During that time, many fans have seen every promotional video, every interview with Yu Suzuki, every behind the scenes video, and since Shenmue 3's announcement, interest in researching has only skyrocketed.I went into this film expecting to learn nothing new but I was wrong. In fact, this is a film that gives the most intimate look into not only the facts but the hearts of those in development of these games. This is truly their story as much as it's the story of the fans. This film is a must own for a true Shenmue fan.",False
2,8,"Pleasant, cohesive, rare documentary",jfgemini,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shenmue is a very curious and quiet body of work, and this documentary did a nice job of capturing the ethos of the game franchise and Yu Suzuki's dreams. I loved the interviews with the team and how the doc aimed for a very specific nostalgia with Western gamers and Japanese culture in the 80s. I wish it went into more depth with Shenmue's use of quick time actions, a surprising tool that modern day games use to build story and action. The Shenmue anime is fun and has a wink towards the ending of Shenmue 2 (and yes, another long delay that might not see another season), so the franchise as a whole will be alive and the fandom will always appreciate this masterwork. With anime and Japanese media being more and more consumed globally, it's a marvel that Shenmue has stayed into the pop culture sphere, however in small doses and it specifically sums FOR a certain age and in a way it should stay that way Shenmue 0 is more than welcoming and having a remastered collection would be excellent, but similar to Miyazaki, Suzuki goes by his own pace and his art is more appreciated for it. We experience and learn more in a certain scope of things. Videogames are the quintessential art for that. It may be hard to play every game at every time frame, but Shenmue is a starting point in the discussion of videogames imitating life in its true art form.",False
3,10,There's no better journey then the SHENMUE journey!,giiiftshop,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an absolute incredible journey it's been! Amazing documentary about the greatest video-game series ever made! Relived my childhood and brought back so many wonderful, heartwarming memories. Loved all the cast & fan interviews and being able to visit and see the real life locations from the game was awesome! The game was truly way ahead of its time in 1999 and led the way to how we play video-games today! A massive thank you to Yu Suzuki and the Shenmue community for saving Shenmue 3 and now #LetsGetShenmue4! Let's keep the dream alive and most importantly Keep friends... those you love... close to you...",False
4,10,More than a Shenmue Documentary,mattoliverwork,n/a,16/08/2025,"While this is a fantastic documentary about Shenmue what it offers goes beyond the Shenmue series.A musical score that is breathtaking and a gaming history lesson that no gamer should miss. You are taken on a trip behind one of the most ground-breaking titles ever made and it is told wonderfully.Some of the shots using the old CRT and arcade machines are personal favorites with the opening scene striking particularly strong emotions with me as it was a replica of my life in the 90's. Gaming, music and Shenmue!If this doesn't inspire you to play Shenmue or help get Shenmue 4 nothing will!",False
5,10,Clearly made BY fans FOR fans.,jeremycreek,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I was 12 years old, I received an issue of Expert Gamer magazine, and within that magazine was a (spoiler free) walkthrough for this game I've never heard of, called Shenmue. I remember reading through the walkthrough from start to finish and being astounded at just how much you are able to do. That year, the only things in my Christmas list, was a Sega Dreamcast, and Shenmue.I am now an almost 35 year old man, Shenmue has been in my life for much longer than it was not. After all these years, I still regard it as my favorite video game franchise.When I discovered there was going to be a documentary made about it, I was all for it, but my expectations were very high. If it was going to be made, it has to be made right.I just finished watching this documentary, and all I can say is: perfection. This was clearly made with the love and care that only the massive Shenmue community can understand.The included Making of Shenmue: The Gang Edition was just as great. As The Gang's biggest fan (Mike can attest to that), it was amazing to see them included, as they were an integral part of the Shenmue community as well.In conclusion, this blasted through all expectations, and is one of the best documentaries I had seen in years.",False
6,10,Labour of love is an understatement.,philkasafir,n/a,16/08/2025,"Adam and the team really went balls to the wall with this documentaryIt was a blessing from start to finish, the announcement of Shenmue 3 naturally delayed release (after all this was announced way before Shenmue 3!) So Adam did the right thing and created even more beautiful footage to accommodate itA true testament to the love that still exists 24 years later, most of us are now balding, have dad bellys and certainly aren't getting younger!Thank you Adam Sipione and your amazing team for bringing this beautiful project to completion! Big love brother! This was a treat !Thank you.It was so refreshing to see this and you complete your project, every interview is outstanding and the editing is top notch ðŸ˜Ž",False
7,10,A Passionate Journey,omakish,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never played the Shenmue games but I am fascinated by video game development. This documentary was so interesting despite not knowing the game. Shenmue was truly groundbreaking and I feel like I learned so much from this film.Even if you didn't play this game, I think you will be hit with a wave of nostalgia for your favorite video game from watching this. The passion the filmmaker has for it makes it even better. The love for it definitely comes right through the screen.This documentary was wonderfully put together and edited. I highly recommend a watch for any gamer, especially if you enjoy the making of content.",False
8,10,Beautiful Nostalgia and Japan what more can you ask for,ravsharma-60879,n/a,16/08/2025,"This group did a phenomenal job telling a story that will keep you hooked from start to finish. What a wonderful journey to take with the passions of the producers and crew and those interviewed.Even if you are not aware of this particular video game or have an interest in gaming in general, you will be sucked in by the presentation and production of this film. It is gems like these that catch you by surprise in the best way and keep you thinking about them in the days to come. Wish there were more films made in this way from the heart as it truly comes through to the viewer.Take this trip to Japan and a deep dive into nerd heaven, you will not regret it!",False

1,9,Hard Life Nth Australia,mdl-06602,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA very slick and well produced doco about a murder mystery in waters off far north gulf country in Australia. The characters and families in this yarn you could not make up . They are extraordinary, multi layered and complex people who live in a world foreign to most . However what I am hopeful of is that someone based on this documentary turns this into a feature film or mini series . There is so much depth in the characters , the story is tragic and the location magnificent . The murders remain officially unsolved but you are left in no doubt in this doco who the offenders are even though they were acquitted in court - please somebody make this movie !",True
2,8,Shocking and gritty but well worth a watch,jojolovesfilms,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA well-made and fascinating documentary covering the murder of a child and his father in Far North Queensland. The documentary provides an insight into the harsh conditions and tough life of the people who choose to live up here to exploit the rich waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria. It centres around two key families at the heart of the fishing community and their determination to protect their lucrative fishing businesses, no matter the cost. Their brutality and casual cruelty towards the sea creatures tells you everything you need to know about these people and the scene of the little shark trying to swim away from the chopping block after they'd cut his fins and back half off was gut-wrenching. Truly terrible people living terrible lives and raising the question, will anybody ever be brought to justice for the murders?",True

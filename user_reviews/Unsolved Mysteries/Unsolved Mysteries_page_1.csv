1,8,Ominous and unsettling indeed.,heavensnight-88203,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very well made reboot of the iconic series, Netflix does generally seem to be very good at crime documentary's. Six episodes in Vol. 1 and these first six cases are bizarre and completely intriguing.The production is sleek, low key and emotive. I also really like the reimagining of the theme tune.If you like true crime and a mystery, I would highly recommend this new series. I can't wait for Vol 2.I should also state that you need more of an attention span than that of a goldfish to truly enjoy these cases, as they are singular and focused. Unlike the original series. A change that I think here works for the better.Great stuff.",False
2,7,"It doesn't quite ""Stack"" up to the original",Osibob,n/a,16/08/2025,"Someone commented that the revamped version of 'UM' reminds them of ""Dateline,"" which I find to be an apt comparison. Though I will say the first and fifth episodes are exceptions; the latter for more obvious reasons. The former episode was great and reminded me of the original series. Yes, it was a whodunit, but other aspects were brought in. For example, how was the victim killed? It was under very unusual circumstances and shrouded by mystery, oh and the Freemasons!!!
Despite them going down a more ""Dateliney"" path for most of the other episodes, I still enjoyed the program overall and give them kudos for trying something different. 7/10...Good, not great.",False
3,7,One story per episode???,laughing_cat,n/a,16/08/2025,"As others have said, this new format feels like Dateline. What happened to 4-6 mysteries per episode? We already know they are unsolved, so 52 minutes is a LONG time to spend on something with no closure. I do not see this one lasting very long unless the pace is improved.",False
4,7,Why they blew out S4 ?!!,saradastoum-39603,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can someone help me to understand why they blew out s4 like this with horrible boring old story and a moth man ?!??Like there is no real crime happening in the world ?!! So they had to dig up a case from 1977 and interview a bunch of stupid people about a mothman? :)))
By the way I'm always wondering why all these supernatural stories happen in the us ? Is it the level of intelligence of average people or what ?!? From UFO, Big food, shape shifter or whatever mystical creature are all been seen in the united state ?! But Mothman ?!? It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard ! And why none has a picture of any of these ? Or a video ?! Fortunately everyone has an iPhone nowadays....
Soooooo disappointing....",False
5,8,Don't get the hate...,elenaiulianaaldea,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why are people complaining that there is no host? It's always better to hear the story from friends and family members. Just take it as it is and stop comparing it to the old series. I personally like slow paced shows/movies, so I have no issue with that. I guess people these days are used to instant gratification and no longer have patience to wait for a build up. The way this was edited and put together is quite alright. On some stories the police investigation seems quite weird, like they didn't really look into it that hard. But then again we do not have all the details. Overall a good series.",False
6,7,Not the Old Show but Still Very Inreresting and Compelling.,t_mack-84817,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not here to compare the old with the new. Obviously the prior speaks for itself and is iconic. That being said, the newer version still delivers the mystery, suspense, and Eerie experiences each episode. I recommend approaching the new installment with an open mind.",False
7,10,Give me more!,rdoubleoc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally, good content is being made again, or so it seems. They did good with this show, but future episodes need to be just as interesting. Please don't have so many murder episodes, though.Netflix should open the floodgates and produce as many high quality episodes of this show as possible. Along with Space Force and a few others, I'd say Netflix has the best shows right now, alongside HBO. Keep it all coming, please!",False
8,6,"So... there are two main reasons I've watched two episodes. Wait, make that three:",amsterdamjen,n/a,16/08/2025,"1. There's someone actually named Pistol Black- Cool.
2. The men that found human remains in the woods had planned to meet up and ""eat biscuits"" together.
3. The theme song.",False
9,10,More please!,corissadanny,n/a,16/08/2025,We'll done revamp of the original but there are so many cases to be solved across the US that I am shocked there are not more episodes and seasons are slow rolling to create. This show is an amazing way to bring crimes to light and provide public ability to reach out if they know anything. Hope this show continues as over the years it has helped so many.,False
10,7,Needs some work,justicejvm,n/a,16/08/2025,"No narrator was a disappointment, couple of the episodes where grueling long feel like they could have made each story 30 mins.",False
11,8,First episode Spoilers,radaja,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've only watched the first episode but you can see the direction the series will lead. The cases will be interesting but there will be a lot of filler clips of sad videos, pictures, etc. For instance, in episode 1, we saw clips of the wedding video at least 3 times. The wedding was unrelated to the case. Also, the news reporter making jokes and laughing was completely inappropriate and shouldn't have been part of the show.
SPOILER:My very first thought after they found the body and they could not ascertain where Rey Riveria supposedly fell/jumped/pushed from was that he was in a helicopter. How else do you fall from the height that inflicted so many injuries to his body if a rooftop is not probable? It could also explain the cause for the medical examiners reason for listing the cause of death as undetermined due to the broken bones around his shin. His leg could have hit the bar at the bottom of a helicopter or even one of the ornate and crumbling moldings on the outside of the Belvedere Hotel. I'm not in law enforcement, I do not know the family, nor have I ever been to Baltimore but it makes me wonder why this obvious possibility wasn't mentioned in the show.",True
12,7,Interesting.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting watch, I find this kind of storytelling quite strange, maybe because I'm British, but the thought of sensationalising real life crimes does seem somehow distasteful, but I'm sure we'd all want answers to questions concerning the death of a loved one, particularly when those answers aren't available.The crimes are all fascinating, the first few in particular truly had my attention, the UFO story was BS, and felt really out of place here.Entertaining as someone looking from the outside, but I feel for those on the inside, apart from the one guy, who has guilt written all over his face.",False
13,5,My God season 2 is boring!,dannair,n/a,16/08/2025,"Season 1 was excellent with a diverse range of topics and mysteries that had you talking for weeks. However season 2 is just the opposite, its boring and having to call some of them a ""mystery"" is a bit of a stretch.",False
14,7,UFO episode?,freddy_3,n/a,16/08/2025,Is this meant to be part of a different series? Comedy perhaps? Hardly an unsolved mystery. A very stereotypical American take on UFO's appearing in small towns. Ticked just about every clich√© in the book. Particularly enjoyed the part where the chap talks about getting sucked up by a beam!,False
15,n/a,Nothing to do with the original,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The only thing this show has in common with the original series is the opening credits and title. There are minimal dramatic re-enactments (and I'd barely call them that), no narration, only one story poor episode, poor pacing, and (for well over half an episode) little more than shots of slowly speaking people who knew the victim walking around and brooding, etc. Even ignoring the disappointment of not getting to watch a new Unsolved Mysteries (and the additional disappointment of now being denied that opportunity by having that franchise name exploited by producers who probably couldn't otherwise sell their series) it remains a highly mediocore crime documentary series when there are many better shows out there.",False
16,10,"The XDDL Episode (#3, House of Terror), as Example of What Must Be Fixed",hilaryjrp,n/a,16/08/2025,"The stories of Allison Rivera, Pistol Black, the Brooks' family, and Lena Chapin's elder sisters are heartbreaking and scary as heck, but I'm concentrating on the ""French episode."" I want to demonstrate what Unsolved Mysteries *must* address next season (other reviews here seem to agree). Disclaimer: I might watch Unsolved Mysteries even if the Second Coming were broadcast on a competing network.First, the use of drones. It is to this decade's cinematography what shaky-cam was to the last. Overuse kills the immediacy Robert Stack brought to the series. Some actors are irreplaceable, and Stack, who appears in homage in silhouette in the credits, is one. Drones make this rebooted Unsolved Mysteries TOO S-L-O-W. Stack's ""Untouchables"" aura and appeals for tips to the 800 number gave the original series an urgency lacking in this. Mystery is destroyed by dreaminess. ""God-shots"" from drones and slow-motion cinematography work at cross-purposes to why Unsolved Mysteries fanatics watch. We wanted to feel that just maybe, we could do something *right now.*Second: the wildly popular French series Non Elucide has done at least one episode on XDDL (as the psychotic father is known in his country). Another wildly popular French series, Faites Entrer L'Accuse, also has covered this story. As with Robert Stack, two charismatic presenters narrate the story with the agitation this horrific story requires. Yet ""House of Terror,"" Unsolved Mysteries' take on a John List-style family annihilator, flows at the pace of a Jane Austen romance. In addition to wasting time, concentration on cinematography works to the detriment of the story by forcing the omission of elements essential to solving this mystery. De Ligonnes' mother's and sister practiced cult-like Christianity; Tomas had to be drugged miles away *in an Angers restaurant* for his father to bring him back to Nantes; above all, there's a very real possibility De Ligonnes' good looks and reputation as a womanizer (well-established before the family annihilation) make it likely some deranged mistress has been hiding him out for the last decade.In 2018 and 2019, first in a monastery in southeastern France, and then in Scotland, ""breaking news stories"" announced De Ligonnes' capture. The saddest was of the French monk, a dead-ringer for De Ligonnes, whom several sincere locals believed was the killer taking refuge in a monastery, a possibility anyone who *really* knows the story will recognize as eminently probable.But Unsolved Mysteries 2020 doesn't seem to ""get it."" Possibly drone footage is cheaper these days than other kinds. The Netflix generation of viewers will always demand faster, higher, more intense everything--which Netflix better watch, if it wishes to maintain a consistent audience over the age of 16. I am older and subscribe when ""grown-up"" material appears, because I have no interest in a streaming service devoted to superhero teens who travel through time. I rated this first season of Unsolved Mysteries ""10"" because I'm a diehard fan. I hope Cosgrove-Meurer, the fantastic production company whose call-center created a kind of internet before the internet, will bring back a tough old guy in a trenchcoat and a faster pace next year. Maybe even a French one.",False
17,6,Episode 1... HELICOPTER?!,jakebrann,n/a,16/08/2025,Why was there no mention the entire time of the possibility of him being dropped out of a helicopter? That would completely explain being able to fall through that metal roof and all the damage to his body. His vehicle could have been moved to that hotel and then his cell phone and glasses thrown over by the hole from the parking garage. That case was irritating that the police department was so stupid and just called it a suicide. Unreal...,False
18,9,We feel addicted,deepakpatali,n/a,16/08/2025,"Once you start watching this documentary you will get addicted to it you won't stop till all is finished. The mysteries that will make you question HOW ? And WHY ? Beautifully explained, I liked the UFO part more because the alien secret was hidden from the public. When I thought of watching this I thought it will be boaring or this is crime show but when I started to watch I finished all episodes in 1day .",False
19,7,Very good but I am annoyed,Mimzzzz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love this show. I think I watched every documentary on Netflix with cases like this in Unsolved mysteries.I liked every season and always watching it with so much interest, but, I don't like the last two seasons.Now I watched season 5, episode 1 and I stopped.Why? Because Unsolved mysteries turned into UFO, paranormal activites, ghosts, and etc...Don't get me wrong, but those themes are not my cup of tea. When I was younger I was into that stuff but now, I find it boring and questionable. Not that I don't believe in such things, but only because this show became from interesting to boring. They missed entire field, if you get me.I gave it a decent 7 and only because of good episodes that includes real life stories, and when I say real, I mean for sure-real.Bye!",False
20,9,Unsolved Mysteries...,karynms523,n/a,16/08/2025,"Have just finished volume 1 and I can't wait to watch the rest of this series.
I grew up watching Unsolved Mysteries, and yes this isn't the same and yes, initially I was a little disappointed, but after I decided to watch this and not compare it to the original I really liked it. Each episode was well told and I think it's definitely worth a watch.",False
21,7,Interesting and captivating but missing something,markwha,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching 4/6 episodes currently available on Netflix I'm certainly pleased with the nostalgic feeling of interest and captivation accompanied by the original music and themes of the classic show hosted by Robert Stack. The recipe is missing an important ingredient however, in that there is no host to introduce, comment and conclude the stories. Don't get me wrong, I understand that this was done as the creators and Netflix felt that there couldn't be a replacement for such a perfect and iconic host, but this type of program isn't near as effective with the absence of some kind of a narrating voice to help the story along. This absence is especially felt in episode 3 which is completely in subtitles as well as episode 5 where some witnesses of a UFO and alien abduction on their own seem rather... unconvincing to say the least..This won't deter me from watching the series in its entirety.. eventually. There just no shaking the feeling that you're watching a collection of true crime documentary like shows with nothing to tie them together aside from the opening and closing theme music, so rather than waiting anxiously for the next volume to come out or wanting to watch all the episodes back to back, I'm satisfied knowing that I'll be able to return and finish them up when there's nothing else I'd rather watch or do.Overall I'd award this show somewhere between 6 and 7 out of 10. If it were titled differently and didn't contain the nostalgic elements I just may have gone harder on it, so I may have a slight bias here but none the less, it's certainly worth watching in my opinion.",False
22,9,Loved It,tejadarules,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLook, if you want the original, go watch the original. Can't expect this to be ""just like the original."" It's a new show, but with nods to the past (such as Stack's silhouette in the opening credits - LOVED that. Excellent way to memorialize him). It's not gonna be the same. I, for one, appreciate that the whole episode is dedicated to one story because oftentimes it felt too quick to go between 2 or more stories in a shorter time frame. Don't get me wrong, I loved the originals, but I didn't always like stories being over so quick. I like the time given to properly absorb the situation and let it sink in. Some of the old stories deserved that kind of treatment, but didn't get it. Also, it's hard to have a creepy narrator voice like Stack's did, so that doesn't necessarily ""fit"" this model of a newer show. In the 80s/90s, it was cool, just not the same today. I'm fine with the format they chose for this. The creepy music is still there (and done well for this show) and there's still that element of ""what in the actual heck is going on."" Even after the first episode, I still had that nervous feeling like something creepy was gonna happen when I went to bed that night - JUST like when I was much younger watching the originals. What's good about this is the stories are still believable - they're not saturated in speculation of sci-fi ideas. Instead, they cause you to think of how real life can be very disturbing and bizarre. Sometimes, the suspense and horror stories write themselves.",True
23,2,I'll solve the missing salon owner episode for you,robertlee-95845,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAt the end it said call the tip line, It...was...her...husbandJesus, is that police dept so backward country they couldn't figure that out!? He had the funeral home director arrange her skeleton, he walked around with her head, he slept with it and then acted all dramatic when he dug the ashes back out.... trying too hard to be emotional",True
24,6,Feels more like a generic Netflix true crime show.,nickcassidywork,n/a,16/08/2025,"The switch to long form, single case, episodes can really drag if the topic is a dud, which pretty much everything in the second volume is.Most of these episodes explain the ""mystery"" then it's 45 minutes of drone shots of depressing small towns and forests, interspersed with people in poorly lit rooms being quietly sad.It's also so true crime heavy that when they do ham in a paranormal episode it feels extremely disjointed and out of place.",False
25,n/a,Just ignore the 1-5 ratings...,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"As is usually the case, anyone rating this five or less just needs something to complain about, and probably a hug. There are 23 years of the old show, and I encourage them to go back and watch them instead of using this as a platform to self-medicate. I don't think it's a 10, but someone has to offset the ridiculousness.The show is great, the format allows you to get involved in the story, and it still holds on to some of the favorite aspects of the original, like the theme song. It's called unsolved mysteries, not unresolved anger issues. I just can't with these ridiculous people who think they are being so clever with their quips and crafted complaints.Next season, please!",False

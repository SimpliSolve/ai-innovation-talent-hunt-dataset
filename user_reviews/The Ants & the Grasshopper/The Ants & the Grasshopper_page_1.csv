1,7,The Ants & the Grasshopper,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Told from the perspective of Anita Chitaya, this offers us a cleverly presented counterbalance between this small (one acre) Malawian farmer and her much larger-scale US counterparts. We start in her small rural community where the resources and education are basic, food and water are in short supply and their husbands have the most curious approach to their role as it regards doing any work! Luckily, unlike their friend Winston, her husband does help out now and again but the terrain and the weather conditions really do render this the most subsistence of existences. Wary of the impact climate change is having on their lives, the film crew take her to the United States where they meet some politicians and Iowa farmers who have their own attitudes and problems to deal with. These latter farmers prove much less concerned about the impact of global warming and the challenge for Anita is not only to learn what she can from them, but also to instil in them some semblance of understanding that perhaps, and it is only perhaps, their methods may not be in their own long term interests. That's what made this work better for me. There is no pontificating. No attempt to indoctrinate the audience - we are left to watch, listen and come to our own conclusions. We see Anita's determination, decency and poverty and it starkly contrasts with the livelihoods of her new American friends, but we are also offered a glimpse of their troubles too, as they try to adapt from more ""traditional"" agriculture to more scalable organic methods - without losing their homes and livelihoods along the way. There is a fair degree of Christian faith demonstrated here too - and it is interesting how the differing views on the environmental issues both take some degree of succour from their perceived belief that God wants them to continue... It probably isn't a big screen film, though some of the documentary photography in Malawi is stunning. It is, however, well worth watching on television if you get an opportunity - Anita is an engaging conduit for this important message.",False
2,10,"Gently funny, enjoyable and necessary film",tradu-06897,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being from a small city in the temperate part of the U. S. South, I can see how necessary this film is. It's got beautiful cinematography, a dramatic story tempered with moments of gentle humor, a well-done soundtrack, musical Malawian narration, large, easy-to-read subtitles, and typical - but not stereotypical - American characters. The story takes us from a small town where everyone farms and few are educated, in Malawi, to small towns in the U. S. where conditions are similar, but more ""developed."" A little bit reality show, a little bit international mission trip, and 100% rain on parched ground.",False

1,7,An above average music documentary,pscamp01,n/a,15/08/2025,"I went into this movie with a little trepidation. I was not that familiar with the collective and while I enjoy music documentaries to some extent, it is hard to get excited about them. They tend to be the same: lots of concert footage, clips of videos, shots of band members workshopping or relaxing at home, and lots of celebrity talking heads going on about how the music changed their lives. And yes, this movie does have all of that (but fortunately, only two celebrities: Elijah Wood and David Cross) but there is so much more here: lots of old footage from videos and other projects, and genuinely witty and charming interviewees. Plus, the story itself is fascinating: A few high school friends in a small town in Louisiana end up forming multiple bands that end up collaborating with each other, and while maybe not changing the face of rock as the movie claims, but definitely making its mark on the music scene, as well as producing the most celebrated alternative rock album of the 90s. Overall, it's an excellent paean to collaboration and the creative spirit. Plus, there is a ton of great music in it. Here's hoping there's a soundtrack album coming out soon.",False
2,10,One of the Best Films of the Year.,craigmills-02167,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is starting to generate so much buzz, all thanks to the collective's cult following fans and followers in their entire history. Is this gets even more buzz, this might get an Academy Award nomination for best documentary feature, best original song, and even best picture (a rare achievement for a new music documentary). This Louisiana music collective have helped paved the way for what independent bands and punk culture battle against glam, with a diy attitude and an exciting group of bands most people never even heard of, it will bring this movie a lot more exposure and might be 2023's biggest films of the year.",False

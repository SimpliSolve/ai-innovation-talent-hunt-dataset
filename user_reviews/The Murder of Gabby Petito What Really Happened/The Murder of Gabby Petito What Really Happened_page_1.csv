1,5,Heartbreaking,batantx,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gabby was such a vibrant and beautiful person. It's heartbreaking that such terrible things can happen to wonderful people like herself.This documentary does share a few security video's that I had never seen including the last video of her living while walking around in a Wholefoods seeming to try to distance herself from Brian.However they completely missed the fact it was another couples video that was shared to law enforcement that showed were her van was parked in Grand Teton that led law enforcement to her body.I'm still dumbfounded that Brians parents hired an attorney before she was even reported missing. Also the fact law enforcement were searching the Carlton reserve for almost a month for Brian. This is after his parents went down themselves, located his car, and took it back to their house. Yet the first day his parent show up to the reserve to help search they find his remains....",False
2,1,Quite possibly the worst documentary I have ever seen.,sierratylerbookings,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you lightly followed the news reports regarding this case, you probably already know the entire story that was told in this joke of a documentary. Gabby Petito's story deserved much more empathy than the director and narrator of this story decided to give her. It felt as though they were reporting on the weather, not narrating the devastating murder of a young woman who was trapped with a man that was obsessed with darkness and death. He listened to many songs about murder and death on his long drive home, which he made in a shockingly short amount of time despite it being a harrowingly long drive, indicating that he was running on pure adrenaline in his final days. Nor did it mention that he decided to go on a camping trip with his family before he ran off to the woods. It also neglected to mention how the a blogger literally helped to find by providing their own personal blog video footage of the van to police. In addition to neglecting the fact that had the police made the right decisions when they pulled over her and Brian, she very well may still be alive.",False
3,1,One of the laziest Documentaries I have ever seen,EasyWhiskey60,n/a,15/08/2025,"Did you watch the News while this event was happening? Good, because thats all thats talked about in this doc.It's a regurgitation of everything you already know, with loads of speculation on the relationship of Gabby and
Brian.It's a terrible thing that happened for everyone involved, but the fact that this documentary takes the liberty to fill in gaps is wrong. They apply logic that is based on hindsight, evidence presented is minimal and once again everything you have already seen in the news.Had it unveiled new info, more expert opinions, and maybe even a breakdown of events that help made sense, it probably could have flushed out more details not already known by the public.This is a documentary meant to cash in on a social media hype and its as simple as that.",False
4,1,Not what really happened.,arthutr,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nothing new in this documentary that wasn't on the news, but they left out a lot of crucial information to fill in the gaps to fit their story. There was NO mention or showing of the police body cam footage of the officers talking for several minutes about how Gabby committed domestic violence and admitted to it. By law they are required to arrest someone in this situation, and the body cam footage shows the cops kicking rocks and debating about arresting her because she's just ""a tiny 100lb white blonde girl that can't hurt anyone"". Regardless of whether or not she could hurt someone or commit violence, she should have been arrested and taken to jail. Had the police done their job appropriately and taken her to jail, maybe she'd still be alive.Forgot about that side.",False

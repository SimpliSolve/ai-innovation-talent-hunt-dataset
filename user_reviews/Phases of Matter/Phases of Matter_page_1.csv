1,8,Interesting Watch,aysesenademir,n/a,16/08/2025,Interesting look at hospital hierarchy with a hint of politics and societal problems within hospital walls. Glad I watched it as its subject matter was new to me but probably won't rewatch it.,False
2,10,Great cinematography,cecegul,n/a,16/08/2025,"A gem for people into ethnographic documentaries. For such a small crew, they did an amazing job. I got to see it in a theater and it's definitely not a ""laptop"" film. The sound design on its own is a whole journey.",False

1,5,"Balanced, yet inconsequential",capybarus,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is true that the documentary presents an equally balanced set of perspectives on shark activity around Cape Cod. The whole film, however, is a rotation of perspectives delivered by local residents and activists. There is zero attempt to provide any independent or scientifically verified context even though marine biologists get the air time that is only used to capture their affection for marine wildlife... This is not a kind of movie that should leave you pondering the ambiguity, but this is what this movie does. I still enjoyed watching it because Cape Cod is a part of my family's history, but I wish the movie included something more concrete rather than just people's opinions. At least they could have been more definitive on the size of seal population (is it extraordinary large after all or not?) or do sharks or seals have anything to do with changing fish species based on actual scientific evidence? But, no, the movie stops at just telling us there are plenty of seals, less fish, and more sharks (but no more violent shark interactions since 2018). Well, we already knew that even without a documentary...",False
2,6,VIEWS ON FILM review of After the Bite,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHBO Documentary Films always lends a certain voice to their offerings. The look is clean and streamlined, the camera always peeking in. The vibes are of the moment, like everything was well, shot yesterday. Such is the case with HBO's After the Bite, a 2023 docu about the people of Cape Cod, dealing with lots of sharks in their waters and the startling death of one of their own via an attack at a local beach. Lots of interviews abound, with the subjects almost appearing like actual characters instead of the other way around. You've got the lifeguard, the concerned dad, the surfer dude, the writer, and the scientist. ""On a sunny afternoon off the coast of New England, a shadow was waiting"". Indeed.The blueprint for After the Bite is simple, it almost resembles the diegesis for Jaws. I'm not kidding. You have the shark strike that gets the townspeople distressed, you have those community meetings, you have the researchers who are paid to go out and track the sharks, you have the beach scene where everybody rushes out of the water because someone kinda saw a fin, and you have the setting which eerily resembles Amity Island from Spielberg's massive, box office juggernaut. What's weird is that everyone involved in ""Bite"" seems oblivious to the fact that Jaws the flick ever existed. They think they're living their own Jaws, I mean it's kooky. The only difference I see in the end is that Jaws is only a movie and well, After the Bite is a more sober way in which it would've all gone down.1975 summer blockbusters and 15 minutes of renown aside, ""Bite"" has a lot to say about shark analysis, shark probing, and the diverting subject of seals (wha??). Every interviewee fades in and out, giving us soliloquies, opinions, and anger rapports, mostly all about those long-bodied marine fish. The viewing out-turn, well it's insightful and informative yet virtually disjointed by the time the final frame is shown. Mixed ""after"" effect.",True
3,1,No the sea is NOT our environment,Casino-Royale,n/a,16/08/2025,"To hear one of the locals complaining about nothing being done and that 'it's our environment ' made me want to switch off.The sea is the environment of the shark not humans. Don't want to get bitten sticky to your swimming pool.Very typical American views that if any animal gets in the way kill it.We've destroyed so much of this world we don't deserve to live here and without sharks we won't.All this because they had one, ONE, fatality in 12 years.Absolutely ridiculous and frustrating.Mankind needs to get over itself. Especially those individuals in this show who think killing anything and everything so they can get on with their selfish lives is actually OK.",False
4,1,Skip this awful doc and its random drag show in the middle,noglorynopeace,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTerrible documentary about how local Cape Cod residents are more concerned about their lowering property values then the death of a young boy.If you're squeamish around shark bites and blood, don't worry, the movie doesn't show any of that, but about halfway through you do get to see a drag show for no reason, and a great view of some dude in drags naked butt.TLDR: More seals in the area of Cape Cod, means more sharks. Residents spend whole movie moaning that they should be able to go clubbing seals again. Nothing happens.Here's a tip: JUST DON'T SWIM IN SHARK INFESTED WATERSkip this documentary about nothing and you wont have to randomly see some dudes a** in drag halfway through. Skip this awful doc and its random drag show in the middle.",True
5,10,Really well produced documentary,benmiddleton-43869,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't understand the bad ratings/reviews for this documentary, I really enjoyed it, probably one of the best documentaries relating to sharks I have seen in a while. The reviews are probably objectively correct however I have interpreted the film completely differently.The film presents a multitude of perspectives from different local groups on the issue. The different local perspectives I feel add more to the film than if they just interviewed national groups who don't have any mirco perspective.I agree will another review that the real message is more about questioning how humans are intervening with nature and different ecosystems playing God. What is the impact of that and the difficulty in us actually getting it right. I think they wanted you to actually think and come up with your own opinion on the issue.Really well produced and executed that doesn't get repetitive. I have seen many lame shark documentaries that are very one sided but this is not one of them.Hopefully this makes sense as I have covid as I am writing this.",False
6,1,Humans Are Awful,pulnski_ms,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary was not balanced at all. The locals shown here are arrogant people out to kill animals because they inconvenience them. We as humans are not part of the marine ecosystem. If we want to play in the water then we need to coexist with the creatures that have no choice but to call it home.This documentary shamelessly capitalizes on the death of a young man who is not here to share his views. They use his death as a call to kill the seals and the sharks so that no more deaths like his occur. At no point does anyone think hey maybe we don't belong out there.They continually blame a law that protects marine wildlife for the arrival of sharks. However at no point do they mention that while the sharks and seals have only increased since the law it is not because there are now suddenly just more animals coming to the area. The reason their numbers have increased is because we are not killing them for sport. This is their natural habitat and we tried to eradicate them. This law is the only thing protecting them from the most dangerous species on the planet...humans.Overall this documentary is a disgusting display of the arrogance of humans and how much we deserve what nature is doing to us.,False
7,2,What is going on here_,marijatattooink,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film After Bite explores the deep moral dilemmas and ambiguities that people face in their relationship to nature and animal species. The story revolves around several key characters whose decisions illustrate the pervasive uncertainty and inconsistency of human behavior.The profile of a female scientist whose passion for sharks and the preservation of their populations helps us explore how human insecurity is connected to our relationship with nature. This scientist is deeply dedicated to her work, but it seems that her messages about the importance of the ecosystem go unnoticed. Her understanding of the virus and caring for the seals sets the stage for the film's moral conflicts.The film also follows groups of surfers and beachgoers, who, despite the obvious problems in the marine environment, remain focused on their current pleasures and fun. This aspect of the film illustrates the human tendency to ignore serious issues, driven by selfishness and short-sightedness.The main antagonist of the film, man represents the deepest contradictions in human nature. Man is playing God by manipulating the populations of different marine species. His attempts to balance the ecosystem often lead to new problems, but he still claims to know what is best for nature. Human arrogance and the need for control are emphasized here.Through the conflicts and interactions of these different characters, the film emphasizes the importance of recognizing our insecurities and tendencies towards contradictions. At the same time, the film invites viewers to look deeper and think about their role in relation to nature and animal species.",False

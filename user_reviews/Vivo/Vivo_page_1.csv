1,10,"Lin Manuel Miranda Knocks it Out of the Park, Again",katacody,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely stunning. The music, the visuals, the story, I cannot say enough good things about Vivo. My 5 year old is as obsessed as I am, we either watch or listen to Vivo every day.Lin Manuel Miranda (Hamilton, Moana, In the Heights), has once again made absolutely brilliant music and he is delightful as Vivo. The songs we can't stop playing are One of a Kind, Keep the Beat, Love's Gonna Pick You Up, Tough Crowd, Running Out of Time, and Grand Finale.Thank you LMM, thank you Netflix, thank you to everyone who was involved in this beautiful project. I'm in awe, I don't have words for the magic that is Vivo.You are one of a kind. You were given a gift, never give up or give in. Always keep bouncing to the beat of your own drum. A brand new song was just what i needed (IYKYK)",False

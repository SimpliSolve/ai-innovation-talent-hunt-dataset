1,7,Review for VHS Massacre Too,Reviews_of_the_Dead,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was another of these Tubi documentaries that I put on while I was at work and treated like a podcast. What is interesting is that I didn't realize this was distributed by Troma Entertainment until seeing their logo at the start. I'm also an idiot and watched this before seeing the first one. Regardless, I was born in the late 1980s, but grew up in the latter heyday so I was intrigued to watch this doc.What I love here is that we have John Bloom aka Joe Bob Briggs. Now I'll be honest, I knew who he was growing up. I'd watch MonsterVision every now and then. I also had the movie channels so I tended to watch those more often. I did recognize Lloyd Kaufman due to having seen a good number of Troma films as a teen. Debbie Rochon is someone who I've come to learn about along with J. R. Bookwalter and then of course, James Gunn. Hearing and seeing these people talk about how streaming has helped kill the giant chain video stores was interesting. It is also a bummer to hear how streaming has become stricter when it was closer to a vein for independent filmmakers at first.This has good production value so credit there. I didn't know who these guys were so it was interesting to learn about them and this is a topic that I'm fascinated about. I'm going back to watch the original one to see how this one grew from it. I rather enjoyed seeing the different last remaining locations of Blockbuster and 'American' Family Video. Does make me nostalgic for the days of the video stores.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.",False
2,8,Independent Film Production Retrospection,Tundrorock,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have not seen the the first movie. So there's no context for comparing to the original.This film offers an interesting look at the increasing difficulties for independent filmmakers. Be it from the high cost of the legal system, shady distribution companies, constant changing of goal posts from streamers, and out right censorship, there's no shortage of pain that may be brought upon them. The passing of the independent video stores, theaters, and distribution companies have taken their toll and reduced the opportunity for the challenging of ideas the independent film makers were providing to society. Many of these films were produced on VHS, which as we all know are long gone.But are they? There's an underlying glimmer of hope, an undercurrent if you will, that's weaved into the story. Collectors are preserving the genre, Joe Bob Briggs ' breaking' Shudder after making a comeback he didn't think would happen, and a campaign to fight for a micro budget category in streaming. The odds are long and the goals are lofty, but when has censorship and oppression ever lasted in the long term?I don't know exactly what it is about Joe Bob Briggs but I can listen to him talk about movies for hours. So damn likeable. Give this a watch, once in a while the low reviews can screw you over. I think it's more likely than not in this case and you'll be glad you did.You may not agree with the premise, but I think at a minimum you will appreciate the argument being made.",True

1,7,Raises a lot of questions that are never adequately answered,jmc4769,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Lost Leonardo grabs your attention with all sorts of intriguing questions:1. What is the history of the Salvator Mundi painting?2. What is a ""Salvator Mundi"" painting? Were there other Salvator Mundi's that pre-dated this one?3. How did this painting end up in the estate of Baton Rouge businessman, Basil Clovis Hendry Sr.?4. What percentage of the severely-damaged painting was over-painted by Dianne Dwyer Modestini when she did her recent restoration?5. And most importantly, what is the evidence for and against full or partial attribution of the work to Leonardo da Vinci?6. If the attribution is only partial, roughly what percentage of the painting was done by da Vinci himself?Unfortunately, the film never adequately explores the answers to any of these questions. As one IMDb reviewer commented, the filmmakers seem more interested in the mystery surrounding the $450 million deal than the mystery surrounding the work of art itself.But perhaps the biggest reason why these questions don't get answered is the seemingly unshakable adherence by most documentary filmmakers, including the makers of this one, to the now clich√©d talking-heads documentary style that eschews all narration. You hardly ever see a talking-heads documentary that couldn't be improved by some narration to fill in the gaps in information provided by the talking heads. I had to go to Wikipedia to get the rest of the story .",True
2,8,the male Mona Lisa,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGreetings again from the darkness. This is an unusual documentary from Andreas Keofoed. The first part examines the attempts to solve the origin mystery of a discovered painting, while the second half takes us inside the mysterious money side of the collectible art world. Both mysteries are fascinating on their own, and they blend together to track the 15 year history of a painting that may have come from the brushes of Leonardo da Vinci more than 600 years ago. Or it may not have.We first meet Alexander Parish, a self-described ""Sleeper Hunter"" - one always on the lookout to purchase undervalued artwork. ""That's what I do"", states Parish. He's the one who found the Salvator Mundi painting at a 2005 New Orleans art auction. He and his partner, Robert Simon, paid $1175 for the painting, though they had no idea what they were getting. Director Keofoed spoils any surprise, by delivering an opening credit graphic that traces the painting's international travels over the next dozen years by itemizing the sales: $1175 in 2005, $83 million in 2013, $127.5 million in 2013, and $450 million in 2017.Part 1: The Art Game focuses on the examination, investigation, and restoration of the painting. On one hand we have restorer Dianne Modestini meticulously working her magic to discover what she believes is without question, a da Vinci painting. On the other hand we have noted art critic Jerry Salz who is less skeptical and more mocking in his conclusion that not only is it not from da Vinci, it's not even a 'good' painting. A great deal of effort goes into formulating the painting's provenance - the family tree of ownership. This is crucial to the process in establishing whether it belongs with one of the 15 known Leonardo paintings, or perhaps, at best, from the work of his pupils.Beginning with Part 2: The Art Game, the film shifts focus from the origin of 'The Male Mona Lisa' (as it was dubbed) to its sale and subsequent flip, and the associated investigation by the CIA into possible money laundering. It's at this point where we meet Yves Bouvier and learn of his purchase and flip to Russian Oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev, who is none too happy once he puts the pieces of the transaction together. The use of Freeports by the rich is also discussed. These high-security fortresses allow the owners to avoid taxes by maintaining a state of ""in transit"". It's also in this section where the role of Christie's auction house comes into play and we learn of the brilliant hype/marketing of 'The Lost da Vinci'.When spending $450 million on an object, most of us would likely verify the item's authenticity. But then most of us aren't the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. Part 3: The Global Game details how the authenticity of the painting might not even matter when the purpose is to move or protect money. A ""dark transaction"" allows the purchase to remain anonymous, and when the identity is discovered, it's clear that the art world is now about money, not art.For some purists, the question of authenticity remains for the Salvator Mundi, and restorer Modestini remains haunted by her conclusion. The art of the deal is clearly less about the art and more about the deal. Leonardo da Vinci's legacy is not impacted by this debate, but the impact of the painting on many other folks is undeniable ... and it has served a purpose as an eye-opener and economics lesson for the rest of us.Opens in select theaters on August 27, 2021.",True
3,7,The Lost Leonardo,ineke-hordijk,n/a,16/08/2025,Saw this at Tribeca Film Festival. Fascinating story with many twists. Recommended for everyone interested to know more about the (dark side of the) art world.,False
4,9,A documentary that plays like a mystery thriller...,tccandler,n/a,16/08/2025,"Here is a documentary that plays like a mystery thriller. All the events navigate the discovery, sale, re-sale, auction sale, and disappearance of the most expensive painting of all time... 'Salvator Mundi' by (perhaps) Leonardo da Vinci. It is a fascinating, riveting story of art, restoration, lore, provenance, and astronomical financial power. It is superb.",False
5,9,"Revealing, informative documentary",Valid_ID,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is less about whether or not ""Salvator Mundi"" is by Leonardo da Vinci, and more about the shady ways the mega-rich use art as investments, to transport currency, as tax havens, and as political capital.Sadly, none of these super rich people lose money in opaque transactions. The crooks who started it all made 83 million USD. The incompetent curator from the National Gallery in London didn't lose his job after lying about the painting being authenticated, and certainly retained his bribe. The ruthless Russian oligarch not only didn't lose money, as expected, but almost quadrupled it from 120 mil USD to 450 mil USD.It's frustrating and disheartening to see the insatiable greed of those who have more than they know what to do with, but I am glad I watched this documentary, and learned something.",False

7,7,"For a story about one of the most highly controversial pieces of art, this lacks luster",rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Lost Leonardo recounts one of the most expansive and expensive stories the art world has ever seen. This documentary has a knack of looking at this painting's recent history from a different angle every 20 minutes or so, revealing a whole different facet of the fervor surrounding this single piece of art and how the conversation around it became about so much more than the painting itself.This odyssey of art and commerce begins in a warehouse, where a painting called the Salvator Mundi from one of the masters of the field, Leonardo Da Vinci, was thought to have been lost to time and languishes before being discovered by two art dealers who look for paintings that are worth more than they seem. Little did they know, they just stumbled upon their greatest find in that respect. They purchased the painting for 10,000 dollars and had it restored, in hopes that the work was that of Da Vinci's. The restorer's work supported that conclusion and, with that, a whole new journey with it begins. It ends up selling for hundreds of millions of dollars after it travels the world and comes into contact with everyone from the general public, to art critics, to experts, to Russian billionaires, to wily art dealers and world leaders.Director Andreas Koefoed seems to understand the potential of what he has at his fingertips here - betrayal, treachery, power, greed - it's a winning concoction. For all the goodwill it earns in the riveting way it unfolds, The Lost Leonardo lacks a stylistic backbone to hold the whole thing together. It relies heavily on one-on-one interviews with experts, critics, and those that played in Salvator Mundi's discovery, restoration and sale. Those interviews bear no intimacy to them, which works in giving objectivity to the events documented, but their implementation grows tiresome. Koefoed has little else up his sleeve to tell this story and, for one about art and one of the most prolific pieces in a long time the world over, that's more than disappointing. This film about Salvator Mundi lacks imagination and creativity and is quite staid, which distracts from the gold mine Keofoed has here. Mundi's story certainly is anything but boring; so it's unfortunate that it is told that way.I give The Lost Leonardo 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. Nothing in the movie is objectionable, beyond some nudity shown in the artwork. If you've got an interest in the business of art or the work of Da Vinci, this one's for you. But more than that, the directions this story takes are so unpredictable that I think it makes this documentary easy to recommend to anybody. The Lost Leonardo comes out in theaters August 27, 2021.By Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST!",False
8,9,Outstanding documentary,claytons-247-235960,n/a,16/08/2025,"I see a couple of other reviewers above have commented that this story is 'incomplete' or doesn't give us all the answers. How could it? Whether the painting is genuine is still uncertain.What it does do, extremely well, is tell a fascinating story. Part 1 is about the painting's restoration and appraisal, Part 2 about its sale. But then there's a Part 3!Finally, unlike so many films, it's the right length - not overlong.",False
9,7,A captivating but incomplete story,yordance,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHabent Sua Fata Picturae. Pictures have their own destinies. I wanted to see an unraveled mystery about a fascinating painting. Instead, I spent an hour and a half watching a documentary fixated more on money and art market dark secrets than authenticity of Leonardo's work. The dramatic turns kept my attention and the cinematography was decent, albeit based mostly on talking heads and glitzy scenes. My major disagreement with the director's approach is about the lack of historical perspective. The starting point of the story is two art dealers purchasing a potentially valuable old damaged painting. What happened before that, where did Salvator Mundi come from, who were the previous owners? The documentary does not touch even briefly on how the world's most expensive painting ended up at an art auction in New Orleans. I did a little research and found articles on the topic in the WSJ and other sources. I am not sure why the authors decided that the painting should magically appear in 2005. While there are gaps in its ownership history, it was not exactly lost. Only nobody knew that it could be attributed to the Renaissance genius Leonardo da Vinci.",True
10,9,"Maybe the Greatest ""Sleeper"" Painting Ever Discovered or Greatest Art Fraud of All Time",classicalsteve,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding."" Leonardo da Vinci. William Shakespeare and/or Leonardo da Vinci also once said that ""Eyes are the windows into men's souls"".This documentary about the controversial painting recently attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, ""Salvator Mundi"" (""Savior of the World"") may also show that in the art world, the eyes of a potential master painting may also reveal men's souls, particularly those who may seek to benefit from such an artwork. In other words, the mesmerizing power of a painting's eyes may reveal everything from awe and wonder to contempt and avarice among those involved in the art trading game. Art is not just about beauty but also commerce and even reputations.Most of us laypeople who hear about old master paintings which are auctioned for millions of dollars, euros, or pounds, can only dream of possessing such works. However, those in the middle of the fine art game see things the public rarely glimpses.This documentary reveals how a painting like ""Salvator Mundi"" (c. 1500-1510) have many forces at work among players in a host of different areas: art restorers, art historians, art collectors, art dealers, art auctioneers, museum curators, and even national governments. All are shown to have played a part in the fascinating recent history of ""Salvator Mundi"".The painting was won at auction by two art dealers who are constantly looking for ""sleepers"". ""Sleepers"" in the fine art world refers to misattributed fine art, including paintings and other fine art, which are sold with a misunderstanding of the paintings' origins. In some cases, the artworks turn out to be of much greater importance and in turn of much higher value.Robert Simon and Alexander Parish bought the painting for under $1200 in 2005, the auction house out of New Orleans believing it was simply a copy of a long lost Leonardo da Vinci. Not a real Leonardo, but simply by one of his students, assistants, or maybe even a follower who had not known Leonardo at all. It was described as heavily over-painted and a ""wreck"".They commissioned art historian and restorer Dianne Modestini to restore the painting in two phases. Firstly, to clean and remove the overpaint, and secondly, restore those areas which had been ""lost"".After the restoration, Simon and Parish sought to sell the painting in part to pay for their many expenses, mostly the restoration. Thus begins a strange and winding tale from its placement in the art market, its eventual sale (twice), the last at Christie's Auction House, and then the strange circumstances regarding its being pulled from a Louvre exhibition of works of Leonardo.It begins with art experts, some favorable to the painting with a few unfavorable. There is the Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier who had a Russian oligarch client, Dmitry Rybolovlev. Rybolovlev desired to buy the best paintings on the market. As events unfold, in part because of information regarding Bouvier's business practices, it turns out Bouvier was defrauding his client and others regarding prices he paid for paintings and then for how much he resold them to his clients.It winds up in an auction at Christie's where it sells for a record hammer price of $400 million, plus $50 million in premium/commission for a total of $450 million. The total surpasses the previous auction record of approximately $180 million (hammer) for a fine art piece.But even the high price at the auction is not the end of the story. For a time, no one knew who the buyer was, the Saudi Crown Prince. The Prince agrees to lend the painting to the Louvre for their special Leonardo da Vinci exhibition. But at the last moment, he pulls the painting from the exhibit.What happened? The claim is about national politics (MBS wanted the painting in the same room as the Mona Lisa, aka Giaconda, but the French refused). However, further speculation is that the Louvre examined the painting themselves and may have found some attributes of the painting which may affect its reputation negatively. Several people involved try to obtain information from the Louvre, but they hit a brick wall.Overall a wonderfully compelling documentary about the art world, and how it's not just about artistic beautiful but politics and careers. Of all the people interviewed, art historian/restorer Dianne Modestini comes off with the most integrity. She determined the work was by Da Vinci when she began restoring the painting's lips. No one painted lips like Leonardo, and she concluded that was enough to convince her it was real. She had no ax to grind and was going to be paid for her work regardless. So her opinion I value highly. However, other art historians disagree...",False

17,10,"A Case Of Every Picture Does Not Tell A Story After All And, A Cover Up Revealed But ""Who Did It""?",silicontourist,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fascinating wonderfully made - and interesting - documentary. This is the perfect film for those not in the pompous stuck up inner circle of the world of art. It reveals the utter unimportant world that art really is and the dark side of its greed, corruption, crime and disgustingly vile amounts of money wasted every year on the buying and selling of paintings; some of which are truly hideous rubbish; IMHO! I attended classes of fine art when I was younger, which was where I discovered my dislike of it and the world of it, whilst also studying Graphic Design and, to this day I still indulge in digital art creation on my computer. Abstracts, fantasy, dream-scrapes and spaces-capes, plus my favourite style of work (which I call Free-form) that includes Fractal art.There are some interesting and utterly disturbingly tasteless individuals in this documentary (but just what - I at least - expect of this secretive seedy world). I shall not go into anything about it, as it is something you absolutely must experience for yourself...it is that interesting and gripping! I shall only say that the painting should not be classified as a Leonardo da Vinci work. The reason is because I believe it to have been worked upon by at least 3 people; and 2 of them did the larger percentage of the work!",False
18,9,An interesting watch.,plan99,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMoney was the sole driver to have this painting authenticated as being the real deal. Many of those taking part looked very shifty none more so than the bloke from The British Museum who I found to be very unconvincing every time he spoke.Can it be an original Da Vinci when it's estimated that just 15% of the paint remaining was applied by him? No it can't be by any stretch of the imagination and with tons of wishful thinking.A bit like an episode of the UK TV programme ""Fake or Fortune"" but with a lot more money at stake.The art world is mostly smoke and mirrors as is very obvious in this film.",True

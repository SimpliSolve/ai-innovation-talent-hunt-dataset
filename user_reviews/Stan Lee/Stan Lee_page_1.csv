1,7,"Heartwarming, but skips a big chunk",Climor,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere's a lot of heart in this documentary, and the fact that it's all in Stan's voice makes it very unique, but also somewhat one-sided.It's interesting to see the life of this man, who rose from a measly go-getter in a small comic cook company, to become its publisher while touching lightly on what he went through personally during that time.There's a lot of focus on the creation of certain characters and how they fitted in the comics, Stan's philosophy to creating heroes and stories, which is all very interesting considering his lengthy career.That said, it's a shame there sin't more about the man he was beyond the comic books.It did a little bit of a dive into the altercations with Ditko and Kirby, but didn't have much beyond that. They mention for a minute or two his relationship with Joan, and that they had a daughter, but that's pretty much it. From after Marvel being sold - which the movie doesn't say why or to whom - to the 2010s, there's a huge skip where we don't get to see what Stan did, and mind you that's a 40 year gap. It's a shame we didn't get to see a bit more of what happened to Stan away from Marvel or his opinions on what happened to his characters afterwards. To me that seems like a missed opportunity.It's a lovely tribute to a man who feels at times like a larger-than-life character, who created some of the most iconic characters in modern media. I just wish it told us more of the man, less of the icon he has become over time.",True
2,7,"Good Watch, Nothing Groundbreaking.",tareqzaghal,n/a,16/08/2025,"A well-made yet simple documentary that can feel a bit too corporate-y at times, it is most interesting when it starts to delve into dramatic moments such as Kirby and Lee's complicated history in the 70's, but it instantly steers away to remind audiences of the cultural iconography of Stan Lee and act as an ad for the MCU.Most of the information isn't groundbreaking if you are familiar with the history of Stan Lee and his work at Marvel Comics, but it's told in a really nice way with some great graphics, animation, and overall editing.I love how vibrantly they presented the vintage comic books and the way they chose to visualise the past through sculptures, a really unique way that fits the overall vibe. I wish it had more depth or nuance, because I feel like I've already seen all of it's content in other docs before, but nevertheless the presentation stands out here. A great watch for any comic book fan, or anyone interested in learning about a integral persona in the world of comics.Comics have perhaps the strongest physical nostalgic impact on me. The feeling of touching a new comic book and the smell of it has an undeniable warmth for me, I have countless memories attached to these characters and stories that I will never get tired or ashamed of enjoying. Forget any media adaptation that has come and any that is yet to, whether good or bad, nothing ever beats those hues found in a comic strip.",False
3,8,Pretty solid documentary,jaspercobar,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerStan Lee, was an amazing documentary that did well to explain his life. I found it very interesting why he created all the different superheroes. I also really enjoyed the models of Stan Lee, and his comic team etc. I was proud of Stan because he was against War, racism and sexism. Which were some of the reasons he created the characters that he did. For example he created Black Panther, because of all the racism towards black people at the time. I did get really confused when there was a massive time jump, because it was showing the events of 1973 or something, and then they skipped forward to 2010!",True
4,7,more auto-biography than documentary,ksf-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"The better title would have been stan lee and building marvel comics. It's a mix of animation and actual footage. Even archival film from the bombing of pearl harbor. Stan lee narrates his own story. Of course, he died in 2018, and this didn't come out until 2023. One wonders if he had prepared this in advance, for when he passed. Some interesting tales of events along the way, how he came up with various characters, or why some issues don't carry the stamp of comic book approval. Some controversy over who should have credit for the different parts of the empire. We hear some recordings of interviews with lee and jack kirby. It's a shame that the director didn't have a one on one interview with just jack kirby, or the new owners of marvel, when it got sold. Kirby died in 1994, so it would have had to take place before that! A really professional documentary looks at the subject from all angles, and most of the material told here seems to be from lee's point of view, and mostly told by lee himself. Directed by david gelb, who has been nominated for emmys and grammys. An interesting story, for sure. And pretty good.",False
5,9,Stan Lee: A Comprehensive and Captivating Portrait of a Comic Book Legend,ergo-58534,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerStan Lee is a movie that offers a comprehensive and captivating portrait of one of the most influential and beloved figures in comic book history. The movie is well-directed, well-edited, and well-narrated, with a mix of archival footage, interviews, animations, and re-enactments. The movie also has a lively and upbeat tone, reflecting Lee's personality and humor. The movie covers Lee's personal and professional journey, from his childhood dreams to his creative challenges to his cultural achievements. The movie also highlights Lee's contributions to the art and craft of storytelling, his collaborations with legendary artists, his interactions with fans and celebrities, and his vision and values as a writer and editor. The movie is not without its flaws, however, as some of the aspects of Lee's life and career are glossed over or omitted, such as his controversies, conflicts, and lawsuits. The movie also relies heavily on Lee's own perspective and narration, which may not be the most objective or accurate source. The movie also suffers from a lack of depth, as it does not explore the implications or criticisms of Lee's work in a meaningful way. Stan Lee is a movie that is entertaining and informative, but not groundbreaking or critical.",True
6,10,Amazing Lee,isaac-babsky-788-221383,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a professional art critic, but as an ordinary person that only knew Lee by its achievements not by the processes to get there, this documentary gave me a wider and deeper perspective not only about how Lee was a genius in the using of empathy but also in translating the reality around him (especially the youth one) into something amazingly simple and accessible to the mass audience, in a very different and lighter way that institutions and governments do so. To be honest, I've never truly understood why Marcel comics was much more effective then DC get into the heart of all generation, race, origin ranges of people around the world, now I got it.",False
7,2,Self serving propaganda from the house of mouse,philnextdoor-49816,n/a,16/08/2025,"In many ways this did not surprise. In his own words Stan the Man inflates and regurgitates his own modest history to that of superhero status. Though in many ways a progressive and forward thinking creator this only shovels more turf on the graves of his equally illustrious collaborators and only can be read as an extended advertisment for his home at Disney+.With a cutup narration delivered awkwardly scattershot from Lee himself, here is a smoke blowing look into a lifetime of one mans aparently singlehanded endeavor to create a world beating comic book company.Disingenous and self serving. Avoid.See instead, 'In Search Of Steve Ditko', on YouTube, which at least allows more room for dissenting voices.2/10.",False
8,10,Great documentary,FilmSpace215,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great documentary about the history of Stan Lee. The way he created the comics is great and educational.

10,10,Marvel-lous,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well of course as always: no pun intended. Having a movie about the life of Stan Lee ... I reckon many were waiting for this. It would have made sense to watch it on his 100th Birthday ... well what would have been his 100th that is of course. He has left us and you may have noticed his absence from the Marvel movies or projects in general. As I understand they are allowed to use his likeness if they want to - and maybe they will do in the future again.But this is not so much about his cameos - this is about him. Fully and really about him - especially because they use his own words (from interviews), to tell his story. So you get it from the ... horses mouth? Is that the saying? That is a bit weird. And the documentary does have some weird moments too by the way. Especially when certain conflicts are being highlighted. If you have a big company not everyone will be on your side or happy with you.And yet most are or rather were with Stan Lee. Which is not his full name - but you will get this when you watch the documentary. Not everything can be highlighted, but the important stuff is in this. Does it show him in a good light? Yes, but his actions (and words) showcase that he does not need anyone to make a saint out of him .. he was progressive thinking most of the time anyway. So on the right side of ... well any moral discussion I assume.That does not mean, everything he did was good. But his intentions were and most of it worked out great too. There are quite a few gems here, though I am not sure what real fans already know or rather knew of him (like how Spiderman came to be) ... still more than an interesting watch ...",False
11,2,A sales pitch and an incomplete portrayal,Klaaatu,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie, left me very disappointed because it failed to really describe the life of this iconic figure. While it carried the name of Stan Lee, the narrative seemed to be tailored to cater to the interests of the producers or the streaming channel publishing it rather than offering an in-depth exploration of the man himself.I had hoped the film would shed light on the lesser-known aspects of Stan Lee's life, particularly the challenges he faced due to people taking advantage of him and attempting to claim ownership of his creative work. Unfortunately, these crucial elements were glossed over or omitted entirely, leaving a significant gap in understanding the man's life.One of the best traits of Stan Lee was his kind and forgiving nature, which often made him overlook the harsh realities of the business world. This quality, while endearing, unfortunately made him vulnerable to manipulation by those driven by greed and self-interest. The movie missed a crucial opportunity to delve into this aspect of his personality, which would have provided a deeper appreciation of his character.Stan Lee's contributions to the world of comic books and superheroes revolutionized the entertainment industry, yet his personal struggles with deceptive individuals were equally compelling. By neglecting to portray these challenges, the movie failed to give audiences a real understanding of the man behind Marvel.Despite the movie's shortcomings, it did manage to touch on some positive aspects of Stan Lee's life, but that's all it was.Stan Lee had the potential to be a compelling and insightful story, but it fell short by focusing on a limited and curated narrative. The movie did not do justice to the complex and multifaceted man that Stan Lee was, and it missed an opportunity to shed light on the challenges he faced and the impact he had on the world of storytelling and imagination. While it may serve as an introduction to Stan Lee's legacy for some, it ultimately leaves much to be desired for those who sought a more comprehensive and honest portrayal of the man who deserved better recognition for his contributions.",False
12,10,Best documentary I have ever seen,grafxman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stan Lee Is an American Legend. This terrific documentary covers his long, long life and his work at Marvel as well as much of his personal life. His impact on American culture should not be under estimated. His stories have shaped the psych of people of all ages for many decades. Americans have been taught by Stan Lee to believe that good will triumph over evil. We all want to be a Super Hero and Stan Lee makes us believe that we just might, some day, be just that. Stan Lee is a GREAT American and as this documentary clearly shows he is also a great guy. His imagination is unsurpassed. A quick examination of the characters he has created shows that.",False
13,2,Middling Marvel Memories!,katharineshowalter,n/a,16/08/2025,"A glossy cover without substance inside. You know how when your grandpa tells stories that as he gets older the stories get retconned so he sounds more and more like a hero? Stan Lee has been doing this since the '70s. Stuff that just happened by chance or that Ditko or Kirby came up with, Lee says came to him after some inspiration or consideration. Sure, Stan. Anyone who has seen him speak at a con knows he was all hot air and self-hagiography. Lee became a salesman in the '70s, and frankly he had to, to stay in the biz. And it was through his ruthless salemanship that comic books became as influential as they became to you and me. Did he screw over Kirby and Ditko? Most certainly. Roy Thomas is the one who says the smartest thing in this doc-that Kirby and Ditko and Lee were able to do what they did only because they worked together. But for the most part that of nuance is missing from this CBS Sunday Morning-style puff piece. The story of Lee and Marvel needs to be told alongside the story of the commercialization/corporate takeover and cheapening of the value of comic book heroes. That's the crossover event I want to see.",False
14,5,Where's the salt?,atleverton,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story of Stan Lee as told mostly by Stan Lee. While it is interesting to hear from the subject of a documentary, the film makers themselves should be a little more detached. They do touch upon the idea that Stan Lee may not have come up with this iconic characters himself, but an interview with Jack Kirby is edited in a way that makes Kirby look like he doesn't have much of a case, and he did. The other part of this film is that it really wants to be a happy story, but the end of Stan Lee's life was anything but. He was accused of sexual assualt, and he definitely was the victim of elder abuse. (there was even a trial). Neither of these things were mentioned.",False
15,n/a,Great Documentary,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been waiting for this Documentary ever since i Got to know who Stan Lee was. I love Stan the Man and Marvel. Great look Into how he became One of the most Famous Comic Book Creators. I Think he missed a few deatails, but he some of those in 'Marvel: 75 Years From Pulp to Pop!' I'm only 12 so it didn't really have a Big influence on me when he passed, but it has now. This Story made my Respect for Stan Lee become even bigger.For me Stan Lee is a Legend and this Documentary not only shows it, but makes us even more sad that he has passed.Stan was a Great man and an Idol for me. I give this Documentary a 9/10.",False

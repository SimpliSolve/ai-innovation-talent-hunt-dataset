1,7,"Altruistic Idea, Flawed construct, Scary Allegory",Agent10,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tucson, Arizona is my hometown and in all honesty, I have seen Biosphere 2 only once. It is a magnificent structure that makes you wonder what compelled eight people to try and make a life in this small and enclosed space. While there are plenty of controversies about the legitimacy of the project and the band of individuals who constructed this experiment, it's pretty clear that a great many people (especially those on this review page) have very little idea about the idea of allegory.I'll start with the structure of the documentary, which for all intents and purposes is fine. They probably could have trimmed off 15-20 minutes of the buildup to the Biosphere 2 but it was fascinating to see the mindset of the people that conceived this idea. While the defamatory buzz word of ""cult"" is always tossed around, usually critics are forgetting that a cult's main job is to take money from its participants and grow. Hmmm.... I wonder what religious organizations do that? Try all of them.Anyway, my only gripe is they didn't focus enough on the inner turmoil of the crew once it starting hitting the fan. While this would have added a bit more doom and gloom to the film, I think a less rose colored lens would have helped. It's clear they didn't have enough scientific help on the project, and it was also clear they were not transparent about the countermeasures in place with the back-up systems. But I also think people jumped on the negative too quickly. This was an experiment that was the first of its kind, and one has to understand that not everything is going to go perfectly. News media, especially the local Tucson news which had a rather conservative bent at the time, were all too willing to mock the idea of ""hippies"" with the capital to make this happen.Ultimately, one of the former crew members summed it up perfectly. Capitalism has monetized any potential science associated to the project, and it remains a strange tourist destination in a dusty small town. It's the monument of steel and glass in an area that is largely old houses and mobile homes. It was a shock to see perpetual liar and scum bag Steve Brannon in this mess, clearly illustrating that his terrible talking points and smug superiority was not a recent development.This story does illustrate one thing that I wish people would take more seriously. Each person does have an affect on our own biosphere. Whether we think we are insignificant or not, we cannot buy into the capitalist doublespeak that business and ""Wall Street"" minds can solve the ills of society and our planet. They have no long term goals, no personal responsibility to other human beings and no soul. Go ahead and give me a down vote for that if you like...you know it is true.There was a great scene at the end of the movie Silent Running that illustrated the conundrum of our current humanity. The space ship was being called back and the corporatists that destroyed the planet felt the right thing to do was simply continue destroying, even if it was the last piece of beauty left from our great planet. We need to continue to maintain our planet, for we are not going to some other planet any time soon. And frankly, blowing up the ship is not a viable option.",False
2,7,"Not great, not bad.",JurijFedorov,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are quite a few things to mention about this doc. I think most will agree on what it is and isn't, but it's easier to ignore some of the bad things if you don't understand what is missing. If you don't think too critically about it it's quite fine.We start with an ""older"" guy who starts a commune/cult in 1967. He invites a bunch of pretty young women and some handy and hardworking men into his cult. The doc never explains what is what or why this story is told. We just see it happening. And hence the main issue with the doc appears. It has no narrator. Everything is told via interviews by people who participated in the project. So clearly they don't want to reveal too much drama or personal details. They are all older now and talk in a slow relaxing way. There is very little energy, passion, or clear motivation behind any story. It's just ""we did this big thing once"". The cult is just explained as a group of people who decided to build things together. All the potential sex and drugs stories are ignored. The leader did marry a cult member, but that's as much as they are willing to tell us about the sexual activities in it. I'm not demanding they reveal more, but it's still a shame we as viewers are not privy to greater insight. If you make a cult this boring in a doc that's a production issue.The cult starts working on building projects for an oil billionaire. Basically a son from a rich family. This billionaire soon decides to build this giant greenhouse for $200m and has the cult build it and run it for him. Okaaaaay... that's going to turn out well. Well, it of course ends in chaos, but since there is no narrator we just hear about small conflicts that all get resolved right away. A new group of younger people appears and have to live in the sphere. We are never told who they are or where they are from. They are just shown on screen and we are told what job they will have in the biosphere. The cult promises media that the sphere will be fully sealed for 100 years. Zero air will get in or out. The young group itself will be locked up for 2 years. They proclaim it to be a big scientific project created to see how humans would live in such places in outer space. As they are selling it as a science project they invite scientists in to observe it all too. Media worldwide is obsessed with this project and idea. But it's all a ""fake"" science project. In reality they are hiding a ton of revealing details from the media and soon the journalists get mad as all the lies are uncovered.We see the great problem with the project. A woman cuts her finger and has to go to a hospital. That's of course a breach. The media follows her. But most understand that it has to be done. But then she decides to carry in bags with various things into the sphere. Again, a second breach. The whole points was that they would survive on their own, but clearly that's not what the participants want to do. When they can they will improve their conditions.Then we find out that sphere actually doesn't produce enough oxygen. And it's a giant cost without making profit. Neither is a surprise as the cult members are running all parts of it. Any cult member could just decide to be an engineer, architect, CEO, economic supervisor on any of their projects. So you have a ton of hippies running a giant business. As there is no narrator we are never told about their big mistakes or why the CO2 level raises. It just does. Giant oversight in the doc. You can easily find way more info about the conflicts, fights, cheating, and other things in this project from other media. In this doc it's a slow plain experience. The journalists soon find out that the sphere has a machine catching the CO2. Outside scientists are flabbergasted. It was sold as a cealed scientific project not a giant lie made for media. After the CO2 issue they decide to let in air. The participants were getting tired and couldn't work hard with too little oxygen.And well, the project ends. It's obviously a gigantic scientific disaster. But with all the rules broken it was clear that the cult never wanted this to be a scientific project. So they are all fired and Steve Bannon is brought in to fix it all and make it profitable and scientific. All their science data is thrown out. Not that it was worth anything. But as they only interview the cult members and participants Steve Bannon is made into this evil guy who ruined it all. And the cult is made into this cute and friendly group who never did anything morally wrong.The project itself was extremely secretive. Especially as the media and outside researchers found out they were being lied to and had a lot of critical questions. The cult members refused to talk to the media. The participants were not allowed to talk to random people without the cult leader agreeing to it. So this doc doesn't talk about the mytany, or any big mistakes. It's all ignored. Oxygen is just an issue out or nowhere as I said. No reason can be given because the reason would reveal issues with the project. Hence the doc just chooses to totally ignore it. And the major conflicts are explained away as ""there was some bickering and it was soon solved"".It's a nice little doc showing a very one-sided story. The conflict and drama is removed. Instead we are left with some slow-paced interviews and wishful thinking about what they felt the project should have been. The doc is not really ideal, but it's not a waste of time either. They have some interesting video recordings of life inside the sphere.",True
3,6,The Synergists,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Most all of us built a terrarium for science class when we were in junior high. Did you ever fantasize about living in it? Well that's basically what happened in 1991 when 8 scientists were sealed up in Biosphere 2, a giant terrarium built in Oracle, Arizona. Their mission was to live a self-sustained existence for two years, and this was done in the name of scientific research that might one day lead to humans living in space. It was known as Biosphere 2 since they considered Earth to be number one, and filmmaker Matt Wolf kicks off the documentary with actual news clips from that day in 1991 when the door was shut behind the eight biospherians.After running those initial clips, Mr. Wolf immediately takes us back 25 years prior, and introduces us to The Synergists - a group of resourceful, very smart, free-thinkers who assembled in San Francisco under the charismatic leadership of John Allen. At first, it's a little confusing why we are watching these old 'home movies' from what appears to be a commune, and listening to these people, now 50 years older, talking about the good old days. Of course, the backstory of these folks with nicknames like Johnny Dolphin, Flash, Salty, and Firefly turns out to be the foundation of Biosphere 2 ... but not before they form Synergia Ranch in 1969 New Mexico, and then build a ship in Oakland from scrap metal in 1974. Their ship was named Heraclitus, after the Greek philosopher, and their inspiration was derived from writers Buckminster Fuller (""Spaceship Earth""), Rene Damaul (""Mount Analogue""), and William S Burroughs.It's understandable if your thoughts drift towards 'cult' or 'commune', but as one of them states, they were ""a corporation, not a commune."" With international interests in a hotel, an art gallery, and a theatrical group, amongst other enterprises, they were able to sustain their creative pursuits ... unlike the many hippies of the era numbed by drug use. Inspired by the 1972 movie SILENT RUNNING, Mr. Allen and their in-house architect Phil Hawes began working on the idea of a self-contained space colony. By 1986, design work for Biosphere 2 had begun and Ft Worth oil billionaire Ed Bass was bankrolling the project. It was a massive undertaking both from planning and construction, plus the training and selection of biospherians began in 1990.Given today's 'social distancing' due to COVID-19, it's a bit ironic that we are looking back at a 28 year ago small group isolation in a self-contained environment. Filmmaker Wolf doesn't shy away from the science world skeptics who, with a smidge of jealousy labeled the venture ""trendy ecological entertainment."" Whatever you call it, this was an international event and drew interest from all walks of life, right up until 1993 when the biospherians walked out of the dome. In another sign of remarkable symmetry to today's world, in 1994 Mr. Bass fired most of the original group, and put Steve Bannon (yes THE Steve Bannon) in charge of Biosphere 2. It might not surprise you that most of the scientific data and research soon disappeared.Wolf takes us 25 years after the mission to catch up with Mr. Allen and other Synergists. The Synergia Ranch still exists and John Allen remains as energetic and idealistic as he was in the 1960's. Biosphere 2 is now open to the public and being managed by the University of Arizona, and we still aren't sure whether a pre-fab paradise will work in space. Wolf's film is filled with interesting tidbits from 3 different eras, and though the early days are quite entertaining, it seems entirely too much time is devoted to the time prior to the Biosphere. And because of that, many of our questions remain unanswered as to whether the two years advanced research, or whether the effort was nothing more than a glorified publicity stunt. Either way, capturing this in documentary form allows the 1991 Biosphere 2 project to be explained to future generations ... some we hope will be as innovative, and dream as big as the Synergists.",False
4,7,"Solid, fascinating",paul-wedel,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWell-constructed film about something I only vaguely remembered from the 90s.

6,9,This is the Story Behind the Story,kyrna_k,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember this in the news when I was a kid and thought it was intriguing, but I only vaguely remember the controversy. I didn't understand the problems with what they did (it was an experiment after all, not a dare or a bet) and still don't. At the end, they had a better idea of what was needed before they began. That's what you get from an experiment, generally.It started slow but it picked up nicely. I wish there could have been interviews with all eight of the Biospherians and maybe a little more about what they learned, but this documentary is about the people behind the experiment, not the experiment itself. And that's OK. Not what I was hoping for but I was pleased with what I got. I'm glad they showed that these people weren't part of what most people would consider a commune. I would have enjoyed having been part of a group like that, especially once they left San Francisco. It would have been absolutely fascinating.Totally worth a watch.",False
7,4,A truly missed opportunity,NixSar,n/a,16/08/2025,"A truly missed opportunity, dealing with an interesting topic of a band of idealists, visionaries, hippies, in what is basically a cult-like setting, the show never develops into a coherent narrative that reveals much of interest.

9,3,"0% science, 100% hippie",rrkawase,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember as a kid the whole idea of the biosphere 2, but I was too young to pay attention at what was going on around it.At first I was excited to watch this documentary, I thought this would narrate the whole idea of the project, construction, challenges and results. How wrong was I ?First 45min is a hippie review on the lives of each of the biosphereans. Zero science. When they finally go to the biosphere they show very little of their routine, challenges, etc. They keep focusing on some drama and again no science.Finally the project is over. The documentary mention not a single scientific finding, and enters the final stage showing some financial drama.Such a potential topic and such a lazy approach to do a documentary.",False
10,8,A fun doc with lot's of information,ndewild,n/a,16/08/2025,I knew very little about this story going into the movie and so I enjoyed all the background it presented.

It has great characters and well shot interviews with a good message.The first 30 minutes was a little slow and I wanted to get into the main story sooner is my only negative.,False
11,4,Very slow. Could have been much better,asc85,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I have to fast forward through spots out of sheer boredom, then I know I haven't seen a good movie. It was just a minute here and there, especially during the first half hour, which as others have noted, is extremely slow and uneventful. I would think that for 99% of the movies we see, the director should realize you're not supposed to turn off or bore the viewer, especially because the director isn't famous, the people aren't very famous, and the event itself is not very famous. I happened to be in Tucson, AZ in November of 1993 for my brother's wedding, and visited Biosphere 2 after the wedding with my sister. We both were fascinated with the whole concept, and indeed, when this documentary focuses on Biosphere 2, it's pretty good. Unfortunately (and incredibly), Biosphere 2 isn't always the primary focus. There's an interesting documentary to be made about Biosphere 2. Sadly, this isn't it.",False
12,8,SPACE FORCE!,js-66130,n/a,16/08/2025,"Welcome to the fantastic future of 1991 as the human petri dish project BIOSPHERE 2 is underway! What looks like a kooky SciFi piece of last century fiction, turns out to be a bizarre true life experiment, sequestering idealistic science nerds in their self-sustaining eco bubble.Rife with cult overtones and extraordinary characters, ""Spaceship Earth"" documents a group of giddy dreamers as they pave the way for future planet colonizations by creating their own pressure cooker mini earth. What could go wrong?Well, much does indeed go wrong, but unfortunately, nothing of the sensational variety. There is no physical rebellion. There are no monsters spawned. There are no lives lost. Yet it is damn fascinating: the spectre of a tight army of red uniformed humans scurrying about their self made ant hill aquarium, whilst the world literally looked on.There is a ""Truman Show"" aspect at play here, as organizer, impresario, Grand Poobah and owner of a wacky combover, John P.

Now I have a better understanding of how weird the people who came up with the project were.I wasn't surprised when I heard that they were sneaking food into the dome and that the whole thing essentially collapsed as a massive fraud.The show takes the people behind the project too seriously. I didn't care to learn so much about their self inflated importance.

While that was all very interesting, they spent way too much time on it, and not enough on the details of the project itself, specifically why it failed.My understanding is that they let hope blind them and the project never really had a chance to succeed.

I remember growing up and watching the experiment go live on national TV. I have visited Biosphere 2 on multiple occasions and it is truly a technological, architectural, and scientific marvel. To understand how people with no agenda, other than creating a sustainable habitat, and no formal credentials in the scientific community created something that exists 30 years later and is instrumental to the scientific community, you must learn their back story and live through their eyes. This movie proves you don't need to have years of experience to contribute to the scientific community. Science is the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence.

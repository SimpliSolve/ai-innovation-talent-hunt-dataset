1,9,The Maestro,Dello_,n/a,15/08/2025,"First of all I love Ennio's works and maybe I can have a little bias regarding this movie but it was fantastic, a very well made documentary about one of the most influential figures in the music world over the last 70 years. It was well crafted by director Giuseppe Tornatore, who had worked several times with Ennio and there are a lot of guests talking about what Ennio means to them. Clearly it's a documentary and not everybody likes it as a genre but if you are into cinema and scores this is a must watch. Great job!",False
2,8,Meticulous documentary on the Maestro,csm-78119,n/a,15/08/2025,"From the moment we step into Ennio Moriccone's home we become immersed in the man and his work with over 60 years of magnificent music to sample along the way. Yes, we are obviously treated to a segment on his magnificent soundtrack to Once Upon a Time in the West, my personal favourite, together with all the other best known of his cinema accompaniments, but the viewer is also treated to dozens of other snippets of fine music many of which were unknown to me and which I now need to sample. There's an array of luminaries from the world of music and cinema to sing his praises as well but arguably the most engaging feature of this is the man himself, sat at home taking us through his life's work. It's a very long film but the music is so good it doesn't drag for an instant. An impressive piece of work.",False
3,8,"The man, the maestro, the music - you can't spell Morricone without ""icon"".",Horst_In_Translation,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""Ennio"" is a really new documentary, but well actually it premiered back in 2021 already, but took until late 2022 to get here to my country Germany. This surprises me a bit because I see that three of the four producing countries are European and I am also not sure where the Japanese impact comes from. But oh well, I am also surprised about some of the other countries, at least Belgium and the Netherlands. Of course, at its center it feels very Italian and this is also the language you will hear the most from beginning to end, especially when Morricone himself is interviewed. So he knew about this getting made of course. It was in a way the final milestone to his long life. There are four other languages included here too, but Portuguese and Chinese seem to be there only in theory and very briefly. Here in Germany, they picked a title that included Morricone's full name because here he is sadly not seen as the legend that he should be seen as and calling it Ennio only, then maybe most would not know what it is all about. Or who it is all about. Or at least they would not know right away. This is a very long film at over 2.5 hours and that is not too common for documentaries, but I liked it. I think it did justice to the protagonist and his really massive body of work. Not just massive in terms of quality, but also in terms of quantity. Both is undeniable. On one occasion, they gave us the numbers of soundtracks Morricone wrote within specific periods of time and those were insane numbers. I mean if you hear the defining composers these days work on three films each year maybe and that is still a lot, but what Morricone did was crazy quantity-wise. There we also found one of the rare occasions when there was a bit of criticism that at one point he almost went a bit for quantity over quality, but this was just temporary. There is at this point probably nobody on the planet who would not consider him an icon or a maestro (master) as he is called so many times during this documentary. It was also nice to see how humble he was during one really old interview. It did feel authentic.The romance and connection between him and his wife Maria who is referenced on two or three occasions was also sweet and also during a crucial occasion when he dedicates an Oscar to her alone pretty much for always being there for him. It was the Honorary Academy award if I remember correctly. I see she is still alive now in 2023 and about the same age he was when he died not too long ago. I hope she still has a few years left. Anyway, I have not even said that this film got made by Giuseppe Tornatore, a very successful and prolific filmmaker himself and I have not seen too much from him, but I liked his recent Geoffrey Rush movie (that many did not like at all) and I also really enjoyed this one here, so at this point he is a 100% hit for me without misses and a huge success. I think I read somewhere that Tornatore and Morricone were also fairly close friends and I feel like this could be true after watching and not just a loose fake feel-good statement. Morricone really opens up here, also about critical or emotional moments like when the movie 1900 received a bad reception (I watched that very long 1970s film not too long ago) or when Morricone received some very personal praise from somebody who/which meant a lot to him apparently. But all the people interviewed in this film are also a delight. You cannot really find any more suitable fellas. This includes all the big name composers basically, including John Williams and Hans Zimmer, and it was nice to hear what they had to say about him. I especially remember Zimmer's comment about how you only have to hear a very brief moment of (movie) music and then you know immediately it is Morricone. It is kinda true. We realize that as we hear parts from some of the soundtracks he made. Of course, the western film music will always stand out for Morricone I think most will agree because these pieces are indeed incomparable, but there are also other scores that stay in the head. I took a lot of inspiration and music from this documentary.I also really liked the collaboration between him and Joan Baez that is elaborated on in here. I always had a bit of a hard time warming up to her, which surprised me because I love Leonard Cohen and the two were so close, but finding out about and listening to the ""Here's to You"", also the orchestra/choir version later on, gave me goosebumps. I would like to watch the film now that the song was made for. Anyway, I can impossible mention all the interviewees here, but was cool to see James Hetfield because I adore Metallica and I knew they also could not get enough of ""Ecstasy of Gold"". It was funny to see him sing to the tune as well during one concert, even if honestly it was maybe not one of his brightest moments music-wise. No offense though. I love the man. Nicola Piovani I definitely have a very soft spot for since seeing ""La vita è bella"" the very first time and I listened to the soundtrack so many times since then. So yeah, it was nice to see Piovani here. Tarantino is always a treasure and Bertolucci is also interesting. Malick too, but he was included very briefly only. More Eastwood would have been cool too. Honestly, all the interviewees were solid or even really good and insightful. There are only two exceptions. Number one would be Bruce Springsteen. Just can't stand him and he also did not add a lot and is not worthy of Morricone's music and second would be Alessandro De Rosa. I think he studied Morricone's career or something, but I could have done without him. Or at least with less screen time. He should not have been in this on so many occasions. But the good easily outweighs the weak when it comes to the interviewees. Also interesting that they got Sergio Leone's family to be a part of this with how close Morricone and Leone were. Was it his children? I am not sure, not too important anyway, the insight is there too without a doubt. It was just an enjoyable watch all along.The dramatic tension they included on a few occasions was nice as well. I did not know about Morricone's doubts linked to composing film music and if it makes him really worthy and a serious musician. I also liked how he got to accept it, even if he stayed always close to his old mentor from the way things are shown here and this mentor was not big on film music gently-speaking. The second somewhat dramatic arc was Morricone at the Oscars and how they simply would not give him the trophy until the honorary award in his final years and, as a surprise to many, he then even won a competitive Oscar for working with Tarantino. I knew about Morricone's history with the Oscars, but I heard noises of surprise from other viewers in my screening when once again somebody else won. No offense to David Byrne though. He is also utterly talented. Tarantino's comments on this collaboration and the initial doubts were also as entertaining as it always is to listen to him. He does not have too much screen time either, but you could see he admires Morricone a lot, like when he talks about the scene from one of the old western where the protagonist has to find a specific grave. In general, this documentary is also an awesome watch for film buffs as you will find so many interesting movies and inspirations. For me, ""The Untouchables"" also stayed in the mind. Awesome film, even if there is a big spoiler. Another would be the one where I sadly forgot already the title, but the introduction there when we have a vocalist sing the cast and credits to us was awesome and so funny. Definitely something different and you cannot get into a better spirit and mood when starting to watch a film. I wanna see that one too.In general, you learn so much about Morricone while watching these 2.5 hours that I would encourage everybody to see this film, fans of Morricone and also those not too familiar with him. I did not know for example that the score from ""The Untouchables"" was from him or also how much he apparently adored ""The Mission"". And even if you still won't warm up too much to Morricone (which is almost impossible though), then it is worth it for seeing all the other film legends from this movie. So many nice anecdotes here too, like about Morricone's own past as a trumpet player. How he had to take over from his ailing dad to make money for the family when he was still very young. How performing on stage to make a living temporarily cost him his love for music even a little bit. How he would step away from the trumpet in general to not hurt his father until the latter died. How he played it at a friend's wedding again and so on. There is also talk about some creative conflicts between him and filmmakers, even if towards the end they always say pretty much that he was right all along. I could go on and on here with some of the comments. It is always better if the elaborations come from the one that the documentary is all about, not just here with ""Ennio"", but in every documentary, so we can be sure or at least more positive that it is all authentic and not hear-say or even make-believe. Now I regret it a bit that I did not take the chance and see (or listen to) the man in person when he came here at a really high age already and performed live, but oh well. His music will always be featured in concerts for sure and with this documentary I am a bit shocked that it is not in the Oscar race at all. Disappointing. I feel like it could have been a very valid choice even for a documentary to finally make an impact in the Best Picture race. Oh well, it's just awards anyway. We will always have the music. For me, ""Ennio"" is one of the very finest films from 2021. Highly recommended and you absolutely do not wanna miss out on this one, regardless of big or small screen. It's all there: the anecdotes, the insight, the nostalgia, the sublime class. It's close to masterpiece territory. Thank you, Maestro.",True
4,10,Have never given a music documentary a 10/10 until now,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,15/08/2025,"There's a part late in the 2.5-hour Ennio: The Maestro where a clip of Quentin Tarantino calling Morricone the great composer of all time (y'know, over Mozart, Beethoven, etc) is played, which other interviewees criticise as hyperbolic. They say maybe 200 years has to pass before Morricone's music is held to that same standard.I'm going to similarly risk being hyperbolic by saying that this might be the best music documentary I've ever seen. I've seen a lot of great ones, tons of decent ones, and even a number of really awful ones. But director Giussepe Tornatore's love letter to his favourite composer (and Italy's most famous composer) is astoundingly good.My expectations were high. I love Ennio Morricone's music. I knew Tornatore being the director would make it extra personal and moving. I was excited to hear it was 156 minutes long. And the list of interviewees here is to die for- Clint Eastwood, Quentin Tarantino, Bruce Springsteen, Wong Kar-Wai, Hans Zimmer, John Williams, just to name a few of the most famous ones. And so many more, some of whom give insight into surprising facts about Morricone's youth.I learnt a lot about the first few decades of Morricone's life, as my knowledge of him only really starts with the Sergio Leone westerns. There's some amazing facts that I can't believe I didn't know about before, like how Morricone almost composed music for Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.This film covers all the films you'd want it to, plays so much beautiful Morricone music it's almost emotionally overwhelming, and the Maestro himself as the main interviewee is consistently engaging, insightful, and emotive.Could've even been longer. He composed hundreds and hundreds of film scores, so I could've happily watched 10 hours of this. It's also extremely moving, especially near the end, but not because it spends a long time on his passing- in fact, it doesn't even mention it. The film argues that Morricone's music is immortal and transcends generations, and that's a powerful and emotional enough takeaway on its own.(Sidenote- the bit where they broke down how all the different themes from The Mission intersected whilst playing clips from the movie is one of the best sequences from any film I've seen in months; maybe all year).",False
5,10,A must see!,lorelorenza,n/a,15/08/2025,"Moving, exiting, fulfilling. I ended up in tears. Go see this movie. It's a work of art, the worthy tribute for the great artist and humble man. Grazie, Giuseppe Tornatore, we owe you.",False
6,10,Maestro!,RainbowVic,n/a,15/08/2025,"A beautiful tribute, this by Tornatore, to an authentic genius whose value will be understood and metabolized more and more over the years, and not only with regard to film music. On the other hand Morricone was not only the author of some of the most famous soundtracks of the second half of the twentieth century, but also of numerous musical pieces brought to success in the 60s and 70s, as well as symphonies and pieces of contemporary music. (the first, true love of his musical career). Tornatore, who had the privilege of working with him and interviewed him here shortly before he left us, thus manages to show a portrait that for an enthusiast represents a sort of immersion in the history of cinema itself, and becomes gradually more intense. In investigating, thanks also to interviews with directors, actors and producers that Morricone met in his long career, the maniacal perfection of an author born trumpeter in the foretaste, who grew up later at the school of Goffredo Petrassi and literally exploded in the 60s. A career as a true workaholic of the note, but without affecting the production of a long series of masterpieces that have rightfully entered musical history. Two and a half hours of pure enjoyment that every film lover should indulge in.",False
7,n/a,The Man. The Myth. The Maestro.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"From the director of Cinema Paradiso comes an earnest, endearing & heartfelt tribute to one of the most popular, prolific & greatest film composers to have ever lived and whose contribution to film scores has been so immense, influential & groundbreaking that cinema will forever be indebted to him. An illuminating & well-rounded documentary, Ennio chronicles & celebrates the life & legacy of Ennio ""The Maestro"" Morricone.Written & directed by Giuseppe Tornatore (The Legend of 1900 & Malèna), the film narrates the Italian composer's life story from his quiet & humble beginnings to garnering international fame & fan following with his distinguished film scores. Tornatore utilises interviews, recordings & film clips to paint a fascinating portrait of the legend whose body of work encompassed almost all styles and left an indelible mark on film, music & pop culture.While the early years accounts are interesting, this documentary comes alive once his work on Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars comes forth. But with an oeuvre as extensive as Morricone's, even 156 mins runtime isn't enough to cover everything however it provides an insight into how his genius mind worked. And though Morricone never rated his scores for westerns as highly as the rest of the world did, he does acknowledge that he often isn't the best judge of his own music.Overall, Ennio: The Maestro charts the unparalleled career of the legendary film composer with gripping flair but still feels rushed & uneven in its pacing as many events we would've liked seeing explored in detail are skimmed through. Nevertheless, the interest in the picture is never lost and what's included in this 2½ hour documentary is crafted with love & honesty. Serving as a strong testimony to the Maestro's profound impact which can still be felt in more art forms than one, Ennio is a definite recommend.",False
8,10,Nothing like this,tf-59920,n/a,15/08/2025,Sometimes 2.5 hours is just not enough. Its a story over 60 years with a great artist that formed so much. Its the 60's Its the 70's and Its dedication to life to music and when He finally get his well derserved Oscar you will understand.,False
9,10,Marvellous.,krzysiektom,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wonderful documentary. Not only about Ennio's music, but also about films. Italian, French and US films of 1970s, 80s and later. I found myself wanting to rewatch or watch films mentioned in this doc, some of which I didn't even know existed. It makes me appreciate and respect more the Italian cinema of the 20th century, including the so called ""spaghetti westerns"" of Leone and Corbucci. The doc is masterfully edited and directed, and sound quality is also excellent. It is a bit long but absolutely worth your time, if you appreciate good music and films. I think it's important to watch it in a good cinema, because of quality of music and the images. And finally: was Morricone a genius? Yes, I think he was.",False
10,10,Extraordinaire,frcata,n/a,15/08/2025,This film is perfect: there are all the Morricone's genius and all his love for Music. This film is great in taking the spectator inside his composition and his works with the presence of several sequences of the films with Morricone's soundtracks.Some moments and some sequences are heartbreaking for whom loves cinema.What else? You have to watch it. And all it could be possibile thanks to the huge work made by Tornatore. Thanks for this.,False
11,6,Where is Bruno Nicolai?,preswimpy,n/a,15/08/2025,"I would have been happier with less random talking heads like Pat Metheny and Bruce Springsteen and with more insight into Morricone's work process instead.My biggest issue is the complete write-off of Bruno Nicolai who was Morricone's long term conductor and according to many, also co-wrote or even wrote himself some of the scores attributed to Morricone.For me ignoring Nicolai takes away from the movie's integrity big time. His name isn't even mentioned.I'm guessing their professional breakup along with Morricone's involvement in the movie contributed to this.On the plus side, I liked that the movie goes over his career linearly in a balanced way and doesn't focus on the American movie score, which to me are much less interesting and creative. In addition I liked the focus on his work and leaving out personal life stuff.",False
12,10,EPIC Best film composer bio I have ever seen.,HStanny,n/a,15/08/2025,"S a kid I grew up in the 50s watching the Academy Awards and was baffled by it. Not by the glitz or the movie stars but by why the average Joe would watch an awards ceremony that would honor film cinematographers, editors, animators, foreign films, costume designers composers and a lot more. But I cared because I loved film and watched adoringly. Especially film music where there was no recognition elsewhere at all. ENNIO: THE MAESTRO is about a film music composer so I don't expect a lot of people to share what I thought of the film.Given that, I need to express what a monumental achievement Giuseppe Tornatore has created. Having followed all kinds of film composers over the years I have always had a passion for a small group that transcended that title and made their careers literally a musical journey through every musical byway that they were challenged with. As Morricone says in this piece film composers are asked to do anything. I have seen dozens of film composer biographies over the years like ""In The Tracks of"" series, BBC epics and Fred Carlin's Jerry Goldsmith piece. But Tornatore has used his ample filmic skills to pay tribute to one of the greatest, most prolific, wide ranging film composers who ever lived by relating his journey, while he was still alive, and getting him to express the passion that usually comes out only in his music. He does this by every means possible with documentary footage, home movies, old TV shows, interviews, concert footage, snapshots and mostly through Ennio's own words. It is two and a half hours long and all who I talked to (including Marshall Harvey a film editor!) wished it was longer.Morricone himself relates everything from his childhood to the days his dad, and then he, played trumpet on a number of Italian film scores. It is astounding to watch Ennio describe in detail what he brought to his early arrangements and then compositions to make them different, to make them stand out. The interviews, old and new, are far ranging including his teachers, musicians, singers, film directors, artists he influenced, a number of fellow Italian film composers and a few American ones like Hans Zimmer and John Williams. The film is totally dense with detail to the point I HAVE to see it again. The film ends on the ultimate film music conundrum, is it as purely expressive as absolute music? Is that snobbishness that resulted justified? Morricone answers that decisively. Tornatore has created the ideal tribute/biography that I will not see the likes of again.Lastly I saw it with a more than half full audience masked and vaccinated. I know this is not possible for many but If you can see it with an audience do so. There are a lot of laughs, emotional moments and audible reactions that will not be there seeing it at home no matter how large a screen you have.This is a 70 year old's dream film music tribute come true. I was an emotional wreck by the end of it. Thank you Giuseppe.",False
13,7,Ennio: The Maestro,jboothmillard,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI remember seeing the trailer for this film in the independent cinema Harbour Lights, Picturehouse in Southampton, I was instantly interested in seeing it and I'm glad when I eventually got round to it, directed by Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso). Basically, Italian composer Ennio Morricone was born in Rome, the son of Libera Ridolfi and Mario Morricone, a professional trumpeter. This film looks back at his life and career, with contributions from the man himself and those who worked with him and admired him. Morricone was a classmate of his later collaborator Sergio Leone, initially learning to play the trumpet, then he studied composition and choral music, eventually becoming part of an orchestra. He started writing and composing music at a young age, beginning with compositions for the theatre, with Hollywood types spotting his talent and eventually asking him to write arrangements for American television and radio. He moved into the film industry, writing music for many Italian films, and wrote more than 400 scores. His most famous film composition works include: Death of a Friend (1959) (conducting only), Run with the Devil (1960) (orchestrations only), L'avventura (1960), The Fascist (1961) (first full score), A Fistful of Dollars (1964) (his breakthrough, his first collaboration with Sergio Leone), Before the Revolution (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), The Battle of Algiers (1966), The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970), Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975), 1900 (1976), Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977), Days of Heaven (1978) (Oscar nominated and BAFTA winner for Best Original Score), The Thing (1982), Once Upon a Time in America (1984), Red Sonja (1985), The Mission (1986) (Oscar nominated, and BAFTA and Golden Globe winner for Best Original Score), The Untouchables (1987) (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated, BAFTA winner for Best Original Score, and Grammy winner), Frantic (1988), Cinema Paradiso (1988) (BAFTA winner for Best Film Music), Casualties of War (1989) (Golden Globe nominated for Best Original Score), Hamlet (1990), Bugsy (1991) (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated for Best Original Score), In the Line of Fire (1993), Wolf (1994) (Grammy nominated), Lolita (1997), U Turn (1997), Bulworth (1998) (Grammy nominated), Mission to Mars (2000), Ripley's Game (2002), and The Hateful Eight (2015) (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winner for Best Original Score). Morricone won the Honorary Award at the Oscars in 2007 for his magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film music. Morricone himself was interviewed for this film, he sadly died aged 91 before its release, so this is fitting tribute and celebration of his genius. With contributions from Bernardo Bertolucci, Clint Eastwood, Roland Joffé, Quincy Jones, Barry Levinson, Terrence Malick, Bruce Springsteen, Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino, John Williams, and Hans Zimmer. I will admit it was longer than I expected, at two and three quarter hours, but in a career spanning six decades it almost impossible to include all Morricone's credits, I'm pleased it included the most famous films. It is interesting to learn his beginnings in music composition, the editing is splendid, and you are pleased to see the clips and hear the recognisable scores, it is a compelling portrait of an extensive career of a great maestro, a most watchable biographical documentary. Very good!",True

It penetrates into our subconscious and make us understand that film music is not a deafening/repulsive noises added to other noises on the images on the screen. Rather, film music /soundtracks such as those of Morricone could nestle in our minds and souls forever ; to make us nostalgic and to remind us of critical/ memorable moments in life.Tornatore has done a great job at the right time when ugly noises abound on the screens, worsening ugly images.The beauty of Ennio's work is eternal, rare and unforgettable.

So many classics , but so many other rather uninspired disappointing or plain bad films where the best of it was Ennio Morricone's music.

His oeuvre of 500 movies undoubtedly reflects the legend's extensive juvenile training, godlike spring of creativity, and sophisticated, musing thoughts. Though the world owes Morricone more recognition than what's already awarded, his influence infiltrates the artery of contemporary music, constantly rewriting our industry with mesmerizing melodies.The documentary itself is spotless: punctilious editing, ravishing score, recollection of various sources, figurines, and Ennio himself, topped by director Tornatore's personalized affection.

He also hilariously recounts the times that numerous times directors ask him for the usual anthem stuff that he can't stand. The list of those paying tribute is impressive and the section where he is denied an Oscar win for his brilliant score for 'The Mission', losing out to American jazz legend Herbie Hancock is very telling.One niggle, one of my favourite, highly innovative compositions for 'A Fistful of Dynamite' - which I saw Morricone conduct at the 02 arena in London - doesn't get a look in.",False
22,9,Ennio is.....................,fostrhod,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ennio. 2022. This to my eyes and ears is the culmination of 40 years of enjoying and appreciating cinema and in particular film scores. Ennio is a wonderfully put together documentary about the genius of Ennio Morricone. Looking at his musical origins, his early pop career is manic fun and his relationship with numerous directors, Sergio Leanne his old school pal being the principal one and best of all loads of clips from movies he has composed for. I consider myself a fan of the maestro but there was so many films that I didn't know existed that have been scored by Morricone. There's a lot out there still to be discovered. The film works well because the subject is so interesting and he is so immensely likeable. I never knew he scored a symphony to 9/11. Most of my favourite scores get a mention, Battle of Algiers, Sacco and Venzetti, Once upon a time ..., etc . There's lots Edda Del Orso and Dulce Ponte which is nice. Happy viewing for even the most casual of Ennio fans but essential for movie buffs. 9/10.",False
23,6,"Good, but...",movieman-227,n/a,15/08/2025,"My major complaint with the film is how it essentially glosses over Morricone's most famous film composition: his theme for Leone's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.""
How was that even possible in a movie that runs more than two-and-a-half hours?I also found it befuddling that Martin Scorsese wasn't among the talking head interview subjects. Surely Tornatore asked him to participate.I'd love to know his reasons for passing since Scorsese has never been shy about celebrating cinema greats.Also thought there was too much time accorded to relatively unknown (in the U. S.) Italian directors Morricone worked with throughout his career.Bertolucci, Argento, Caviani, sure, but even a dedicated cinephile like me had no idea who many of the most frequent interview subjects were.Tornatore made one very good (if somewhat overrated) film: ""Cinema Paradiso."" This falls into the same category on the basis of its euphoric reviews which seem to be confusing Morricone's genius with this flawed doc's mere adequacy.",False
24,4,Too much nattering,martinmcnulty,n/a,15/08/2025,"If the review was to rate Ennio's talent and originality no doubt it would be a 9 or a 10.But this review is about the film and I felt that there was just too much talking. It is interview after interview after interview.People going on about what a genius Ennio is. But we already know that we want to understand how he works we want to hear the incredible music and see how it combines with the films.Though he is a genius Ennio does seem to be have a very big ego. Maybe he is the one who insisted on having so many people complimenting him. I don't know. Another reason might be that they didn't have the rights to show more of the films.Anyway whatever the reason is, if I go to see a film about Ennio Morricone I want to hear music not listen to people nattering.",False
25,10,An unknown genius,CarolineFR69,n/a,15/08/2025,"Of course everyone knows about Ennio Moricone, he has been making music for movies since 1961, and before that for tons of 'pop' music in Italy. You know him for very famous tunes, from westerns to gangster, passing by any other type.His genius is still completely unknown, he changed music and movie music by himself, everyone is getting inspired by his work today, and over years. Tarantino once said that Moricone was on the same level as Bach, Mozart... And Moricone replied that he could not say that because we would only know in 200 years. I completely agree with Tarantino, Moricone is a genius, seeing and hearing music as he writes it (he doesn't use instruments), putting his whole self inside every new composition. If you love music, and you love movies, you need to see that documentary.",False

1,4,Not My Tempo,torrascotia,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who has not only been a fan of but now also produces ""bass music"", this was a difficult watch. The names associated with this doc are obvious click bait, including artists from genres that really only get lip service. Because this is not a doc about bass music, whatever that is, but its about the lesser quality dub step that has become a meme. The American version of dub step is now a seen as an example of terrible music, which probably required quite high levels of production skills, but still sounds horrendous and abrasive. It will forever be known as being a sizable fashion blip in the states for a very specific demographic.This is really a Skrillex fan doc. While he comes across as a great guy it doesn't mean I like his style of music. And that is what makes this a difficult watch, as there is so much of ""that"" style of dub step playing throughout.There is little Drum and Bass, no actual Dub, Miami Bass or any of the genres of Hip Hop which are bass driven on show. I think the fact there was so many drum and bass DJs in this doc, yet so little time was given over to the story of it, they must have been scratching their heads as to why they are even in this.While this is a glossy production, it does suffer from a lack of editing and structure. This is almost a 2 hour slog and really needs trimmed down. So much so that I had to watch this in multiple sittings. The only thing that kept me coming back was the hope they would actually play some decent music or at least cover something else interesting.At best this is a not great doc about Skrillex and may interest people into similar artists like Flux Pavilion etc. The problem is, most of the interview content you can see better on YouTube for free. And unfortunately this doesn't really bring much else to the table.",False

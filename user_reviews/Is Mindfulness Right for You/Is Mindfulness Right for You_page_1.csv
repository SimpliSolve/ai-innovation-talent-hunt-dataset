1,1,Objectification of Women,jasongrant-31337,n/a,15/08/2025,"I could not agree more with one of the previous reviews.Although the message about mindfulness is quite interesting and often powerful by those who are actually discussing this form of meditation, I simply can not get past these posers who are used as examples to meditate.I see this a lot in these types of documentaries. Most who are used as examples are young and beautiful. They almost appear to be perfect against a beautiful and almost magical backdrop of natural beauty... why not show the the average person in their apartment, back yard, etc? It's offensive, a turn off, and moreover, ridiculous.",False
2,10,It only hurts for as long as you let it.,estelle58,n/a,15/08/2025,"My thoughts can cause me to lose sleep, get sick to stomach, cause a headache, or intensify any other ache in my body. That is because those thoughts that spring up from nowhere tend almost always to be negative thoughts from my past, that really hurt. Sometimes, really bad experiences would whirl around in my head for days, and I felt powerless to stop them. Sound familiar?I realized that the part of me that was observing this madness has the power to say, yeah, ok, you popped into my mind, but I just do not have time for you. It may linger for a while, but maintaining an attitude of....thoughts have no power over you, unless you let them.This lovely presentation, is a great place to start for anyone curious about controlling their reaction to their thoughts. It is in no way preachy, or biased. Just some people talking about how mindfulness practice has dramatically changed their lives.Just watched this, and am already recommending this to family. I recommend it to you too.",False
3,n/a,A discussion about mindfulness can have many outcomes.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Strangely i read the reviews before watching this to try determine if it was an appropriate fit for me.Seeing the 3 reviews 2 of them having odd comments about objectifying women piqued my interest.I went watching and watching and waiting for the excessive and gross misuse of the female form and its beauty as being a terrible thing.I think i spotted maybe a handful of seconds long brief moments where women did occasionally appear in backgrounds.I thought this is odd that two reviews focus entirely on this in a series about ""mindfulness"" as being excessive!?Lets just say i learned a lot.",False

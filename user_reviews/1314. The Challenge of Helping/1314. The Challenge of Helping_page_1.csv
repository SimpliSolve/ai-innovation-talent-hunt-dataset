1,3,A tragedy should not be a reason for profit,fabriciooropeza,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn this ""documentary"" the influencer Juanpa Zurita tries to give an explanation of what happened with the money for the houses that he promised to build for the victims of the earthquake in Mexico who lost their homes due to this disaster, however, he does not give a clearly supported explanation. With documents and dates that support what is mentioned in this footage, the aim is simply to free Juanpa Zurita from responsibilities and damages due to the problems that occurred with the collection of money, they simply go around a lot to say that what was promised was fulfilled but 4 years after making it seem that he only wanted to create content with the tragedy to obtain the maximum profit and approval of the people for this action.",True
2,8,I don't get why the low reviews,a_r_m_a_n_d_o,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting view on how the modern-age influencers can take a leap out of the superficial digital world and make a difference in the tangible world.This is a well executed documentary that portraits the difficulties faced by the LoveArmy charitable organization and its financial and most importantly mediatic struggle to rebuild 50 houses destroyed by a devastating earthquake in Mexico in 2017.Even when it lacks of deeper context for viewers outside of Mexico to understand the plot, this documentary should be a go-to guide for any starting small independent fund raiser trying to make a big impact in a developing world community.",False

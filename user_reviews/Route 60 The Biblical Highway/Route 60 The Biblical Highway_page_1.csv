1,10,"A Touching Journey, Worth Watching",maklava,n/a,16/08/2025,"A journey into Israel and travelling down Route 60 in Israel. They show you so many Biblical sites and have special privilege to see things you wouldn't be able unless you had special permission.They show the journal of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They show places of Jesus, and other people of the ancient days.The music is amazing and very touching at places when they share personal stories of how God was working in their prayer life. God isn't just for one nation but for all people. Repentance and peace is one of the major themes of the movie. You will never forget some of the scenes of the documentary.",False
2,2,I was very disappointed!,macintex-13058,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAt least half of the video was spent filming the two hosts talking to each other - and half of that time was spent talking about their own personal accomplishments and experiences. The remaining time was spent (in order of the number of minutes) on an artsy collage of candles and written scripture, shots of the motorcade (including military vehicles) driving on the actual 'highway', a ""Hill Street Blues"" type collage of sites not even in the Holy Land, and then finally, very very brief shots of the actual holy sites - like less than a minute on the tomb of Jesus, or the Nativity site in Bethlehem. Many times they would go from shot to shot with no textual explanation of what we were looking at. The hosts would sometimes say ""Mount such and such is over there"", but then they wouldn't show a shot of ""over there"". Definitely not as advertised!",True
3,10,Well done,TexanCF,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was very peaceful and heartwarming. You get to walk through the scriptures of the bible with these strong men of faith and character. They invite you in as though you are walking the streets, visiting each site with them. I loved how they emphasized the importance of relationship with God for all mankind and how we have strived with God since the beginning of time. They provided their own personal testimonies at various stops which was very inspiring and reminded us how us how hard work and faith in God can bring about prosperity and success and on the flip side disobedience can bring destruction and pain. It was also nice to see all the good work the Trump administration did for Israel and the rest of the world.",True
4,4,"Really wanted to like it, but didn't.",jnkstilldo,n/a,16/08/2025,"First reaction, walking out of the theater, I turned to the group I'd rallied from my church to go with me and said, ""well, that needed an editor.""
It was very disjointed and hard to follow for a ""journey"" documentary. Longer than necessary in some places while unexplainably rushed in others (Nazareth!) with some stories oddly inserted in places for no apparent reason (Korea?).I felt it was more of a political film than a religious, spiritual, or historical one. Too much patting each other on the back for my taste.Go find the series ""Drive Through History: Holy Land"" and watch that instead. MUCH better!",False
5,4,A conglomeration with the consistency and charm of cement!,itsboutchristmas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rte 60, with its parade of CIA like SUVs barreling down the noted highway providing the excitement, with Israeli Ambassador Friedman & Mike Pompeo providing city by city narrative, offering the occasional personal color we travel from North to South with substantial biblical quotes to embellish the tie in to the current city! This is a Trinity Broadcasting Network production, though any real spirituality is taken down with the combo of your tag team narrators! My first lecture by Alger Fitch in Life of Christ had more sparkle! To say that I was unimpressed, would be a serious understatement! To say that I am appalled, would hit the nail on the head! TBN needs to go back to the drawing board and amp this poor excuse for entertainment up!",False

1,9,"Christspiracy is provocative and insightful, but not perfect",anpeople,n/a,16/08/2025,"After viewing Christspiracy at my local theatre, I googled numerous reviews, and the one from a Roman Catholic publication had nothing negative to say about the film. This tends to negate the sensational suggestion that ""the church"" will not stop at any nefarious act to keep the message of ""Christspiracy"" from spreading. If there is a conspiracy to stop the message of Christspiracy, and if the film producers are being surveilled, it is most likely by animal agribusiness.Overall, I found the film inspirational and provocative, although it totally misrepresented Mohammad's view of meat-eating. The film implied that Mohammad wanted his followers to stop eating meat, which is false. Mohammad did institute ""halal"" slaughter, which like kosher slaughter was intended to cause animals as little suffering as possible (though the rules are almost always ignored); and there are many beautiful passages about animals in the Quran, including about animals being nations to themselves and all of them worshiping Allah. However, Mohammad only wanted his followers to stop eating meat sacrificed to idols, and Mohammad himself was not a vegetarian or vegan. The filmmakers should have left out erroneous claims about Islam.They also included specious stories about Leonardo da Vinci and quotations from Leonardo for which there are no source documents that I have been able to find.I was pleased that the filmmakers called out certain prominent Buddhists for their self-serving misinterpretations of the First Precept of Buddhism, which is not to kill any sentient being. And I was glad to hear Maneka Gandhi's critique of the hypocrisy of Hindus being against cow slaughter but consuming vast quantities of dairy products - enabling cow slaughter to the magnitude that India is the world's largest exporter of leather and one of the largest exporters of beef (much of it to the Middle East).The filmmakers' claims about Jesus being against animal sacrifice and the consumption of meat were well-researched and revealing. Revealed by a scholar is that the word translated from ancient Hebrew as ""thieves"" or ""robbers"" in the passages that describe Jesus driving out the sacrificial animals for sale and the sellers from the Jerusalem Temple actually mean ""the violent ones."" This is a critical piece of information.A closer examination of the miracle of the loaves and fishes indicates that Jesus fed the loaves of bread to the assembled multitudes but not the fish. How do we miss such things, except that we are conditioned to believe as we are taught.There was also something about the Last Supper, with Jesus describing the bread as his ""body"" and the wine as his ""blood"" that deserve further scholarship and analysis. It seems to confirm that Jesus consumed no meat or blood sacrifice. It might be taken as a refutation of the idea that Jesus gave himself as the ""last sacrifice"" as the ""lamb of God,"" but as I see it, Jesus wanted animal sacrifice to end (as did Isaiah and some other prophets) and he was willing to die for it. Some may think there is an implied threat to the integrity of the sacrament of the eucharist, but I don't think it needs to be viewed in such a light. One can think of the eucharist (communion) as a holy and supernatural ritual of transubstantiation OR as a ritual that has been sanctified by its practice going back 2,000 years in the way of morphic resonance as described in the theories of Rupert Sheldrake. According to Sheldrake, when we repeat a ritual long enough, it is ingrained with a spiritual meaning.The portrayal of Jesus rang true to me. Hopefully the film will cause serious discussion of the ideas presented. At the very least, it should create controversy that might cause individual Christians and others to re-evaluate their beliefs and conditioning about animals.",False
2,8,The documentary focuses on the intersection of religion/spirituality and animal slaughter more than Christianity or Jesus.,TheSocialGadfly,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary spends only about 20-30 minutes on the Historical Jesus and his teachings, as documented in both canonized gospels and Ebionite writings (which didn't survive but were recounted in early church documents). I wish that the producers would've devoted a little more time exploring the link between the Historical Jesus and vegetarianism, as doing so might've provoked followers of the world's largest religion to question more about what they've been taught. If I were a Christian (full disclosure, I am not) who was trying to go into the film with an open mind, I would've stopped watching about a third of the way in since I would've felt as though the documentary had no applicability to my faith.I do believe that the Historical Jesus taught and practiced vegetarianism, but the reasoning that underpins my assessment takes a lot of time to unpack-far more time and scholarship than was devoted to the subject in the film. That said, the producers did briefly touch on the heart of the matter at around 82 minutes into the piece, but they then move away from it after about only eight minutes. However, while I disliked the abrupt shift away from discussing the teachings of the Historical Jesus, the move away from the texts at least led to an inspirational part of the film, as the producers showed activists doing what they believed Jesus would've done (the ""What Would Jesus Do"" or ""WWJD"" campaign was referenced heavily throughout the film) while attempting to free animals in captivity.BIG SPOILER BELOW:Aside from the brevity of discussing the life, teachings, advocacy, and followers of the Historical Jesus, a considerable criticism that I would note is how the scholar references the Hebrew word ""parits,"" which means ""violent one"" or ""robber"" when discussing Jesus's statement about the priests and money changers turning the House of Prayer into a den of robbers. Yes, the term ""parits"" does mean ""violent one"" or ""robber."" And yes, I do believe that Jesus was opposed to animal sacrifice and was calling the priests (who performed ritualistic animal sacrifice) and money changers ""violent ones"" or something to the effect of ""killers.""However, Jesus almost certainly spoke in Aramaic, and the New Testament was written in Greek. Thus, while a reasonable mind can conclude from scholarship and the context of various writings that Jesus was calling priests and money changers violent and killers, the expert or the producers should've expounded upon the topic a little more rather than calling it quits immediately after citing the term ""parits"" since, as I noted, Jesus likely didn't use the term, nor does the New Testament.But all in all, I enjoyed the documentary and agree wholeheartedly with its sentiment. For full disclosure, I'm an ethical vegan of nearly a decade, so you can call me biased. That said, I do believe the textual and historical record support the notion that Jesus taught and practiced vegetarianism. I just wish that the documentary explored this more by really diving into the Ebionite and Nazarene Essene movements.",True
3,8,We've known this for a long time,alex4649,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA great documentary that brings into the mainstream information that has been known for a long time.The Jesus movement was a vegetarian/vegan movement. Jesus was opposed to the animal sacrifice system, and disrupting the animal-killing business at the Temple is what caused him to get arrested and killed. He is the good shepherd who gives his life to save the sheep.Jesus said: ""My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers!""But did he really use the word ""robbers""? No. He used the word ""violent one"", or ""murderer"". What he was truly angry about was the killing of non-human children (the animals) at the Temple. Millions of animals were slaughtered at the Temple. It was all a huge business, and the premises were a massive slaughterhouse.Jesus and his followers were fervently in favour of ending the suffering of animals. A tradition that comes from Pythagoras, whose baton had been passed onto Jesus through John the Baptist, another important Pythagorean figure of the ancient times.We also learn that Jesus had a brother, on whom we have more historical records than Jesus Himself, and we known as a certain fact that he was entirely vegetarian, eating only roots, sprouts and fruits.The documentary explores the idea of eating animals and other major world religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism and Islam.A must watch for anyone who wants to learn about the real Jesus.",True
4,10,A great film!,themobilehobos,n/a,16/08/2025,"Surpassed my expectations, and is on my top list of best films if not the top. It's full of information but at the same time, it does not get boring. They do a great job of gently presenting topics all while allowing the viewer space for thought and reflection. The film also does a great job in refraining from showing violent acts. It focuses more on the religious aspect of things and hits on various religions not only Christianity. Perhaps they could have done a better job in promoting the film. The way I heard of this film was very unconventional, and if it wasn't for my continues research and online studies I would have never known this film was to be aired. There could be reasons beyond the producers control for this but at least it is out there. I'm afraid this film will not get the notice it deserves.",False
5,10,Very very interesting!,blondybox,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have now seen this film twice, as there is certainly an awful lot of information to take in. It flows very well and I didn't get bored. The ending was also inspiring and hopeful.The film looks at most of the main religions and was interesting to me even though I am not personally religious! In particular I found the interviews with the Buddist monks very enlightening indeed and not what I was expecting at all.The film-makers took 7 years to make it and decided NOT to release on Netflix as originally planned as they did not wish to censor any of it so recommend you give it a watch!Do watch this film and make up your own mind on how Jesus would have ethically killed an animal.",False

of rams and the fat of fattened animals;
I have no pleasure

It covers also topics such as morality, relation of animals to human violance. Discovers myths about other religios or spirtual leaders as well as for whole big country.",False
7,10,A surprising MUST SEE film,annilanki,n/a,16/08/2025,"Comedy, drama, information and revealing hidden truths - a perfect package for me!!This may be the most powerful film I've seen. It takes you on an emotional rollercoaster, that you'll want to ride again. Just saw it the second time and already looking forward to the third!I had high expectations as well as some suspicion for this film, as I am not a religious person (used to be). I was not sure if this documentary would be interesting to me... After the first watch I was blown away, with so much new information and new thoughts in my mind. I immediately felt like I need to see the film again.I feel like there is something, or actually several things, to everyone in this movie, and it needs to be seen by everyone!",False
8,10,Absolutely blown away!,edwardm120,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the most powerful I've ever seen - a true MASTERPIECE that's exceptionally crafted. From the first moment to the last, it grips you with an intensity that's impossible to forget. Meticulously researched and breathtakingly executed, this film reveals shocking insights that will completely transform your understanding. The storytelling is razor-sharp, with revelations that caught me totally off guard and challenged everything I thought I knew. This is truly an unmissable experience that goes way deeper than you'd expect - a must-see documentary that will challenge, inspire, and completely reset your perspective. I cannot recommend this enough; it's the kind of film that doesn't just inform you, it changes you.",False
9,10,the most profound documentaries on spirituality and animal cruelty I've ever seen,banghainguyen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Christspiracy is easily one of the most profound documentaries on veganism and animal cruelty I've ever seen. It explores the ethical and spiritual dimensions of our food choices, going beyond the usual environmental or health angles to focus on the deep moral and spiritual implications. The documentary makes a powerful case for how our treatment of animals is connected to broader issues of justice, showing how speciesism is intertwined with systems of racism and sexism. This perspective was both eye-opening and thought-provoking, challenging viewers to see veganism as a path toward a more compassionate and inclusive world.The way Christspiracy draws these connections is masterful, pushing us to think about veganism not just as a dietary choice but as a stand against all forms of oppression. It's an inspiring, must-watch film that will leave you questioning long-held beliefs and motivated to make changes for the better. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding the ethical and spiritual side of veganism-this documentary is truly a favorite of mine!",False
10,7,"Right message, poorly presented",Void-Horizon,n/a,16/08/2025,"At long last, I was able to watch the movie online at the official website. It was a long wait for the film to release to the public, and I'm glad it has. This is probably one of the most important films ever created in the history of the art. While I agree with most everything it preaches, I felt it was a rather weak presentation.I have been researching this subject for over 23 years, and I still learn something new all of the time. This film even brought things to my attention I had never previously been aware of, and had to look into further. I would encourage everybody who sees it to not accept this film as authoritative, or even a very good exposition on the subject. There are better sources to be found.I've seen more compelling videos on YouTube than this sensationalist propaganda. The whole film is simply too weak, and too watered down. It's also full of self-back patting, and flag waving. It was very moving, and certainly had its moments, and so I'm awarding it a decent rating. However, I feel like this shouldn't be the end of this story, and that more ought follow. It should've been a miniseries, or an entire series. Perhaps, somebody can adapt it into such. It certainly doesn't deserve to be the end of the matter in your own mind. You simply must look into this further, because the rabbit hole goes really deep. I assure you.",False
11,2,A Question No One Asked: The Christspiracy Conundrum,Antiseth,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film asks whether there is a spiritual way to kill an animal, a question that, frankly, doesn't resonate as profoundly as the documentary suggests. It's not that the question isn't interesting; it's that it doesn't feel as consequential as the filmmakers want it to be. The exploration is well-executed, and the visuals and interviews are engaging, but the premise doesn't quite justify the depth of the investigation.That said, the documentary does raise awareness about ethical considerations in various faiths and traditions, which could be valuable to those deeply invested in this niche intersection of animal ethics and spirituality. For the average viewer, though, the film feels like it's working hard to solve a problem that doesn't hold much weight in their lives.It's worth a watch for those curious about its subject matter, but ultimately, it might not feel worth your time. You could come away appreciating the effort and artistry while wondering if the energy could have been better spent on more pressing questions.",False
12,10,A Life-Changing Film.. to say the least,jeremykeyes-33133,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI left the theatre completely shook. Long interested in religion, less familiar with animal rights, but this was so eye-opening and has already led me to employ veganism into my daily eating/mindset. This film exposes the ties between ""Big Religion"" and ""Big Animal Ag"" through the Jesus crucifixion story... namely WHY he was a threat to the state and executed for it.The film doesn't ONLY focus on Christianity, they travel around the world attempting for an answer to 'how would (insert esteemed religious figure) kill an animal ethically?' --- and the resounding answer was... we don't know. We're always told it was because of his religious influence and anarchist, but the filmmakers find it was more his ceasing of Temple slaughter and sacrifice. He was then killed just a few days later.Fantastic film i will buy and see twice once it's released to the general public. Couldn't recommend more for anyone interested in animals and religion in 2024.",True

Everyone has been compromised into believing a lie (at best a misinterpretation). A Chinese Man. An activist and dog rescuer broken down on camera. He has saved thousands of dogs, but millions need to be saved. Animals cry when they know they are walking towards death.",False
14,10,The Most Important Documentary of Our Time,ryan_frasier,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerChristspiracy reveals the truth about who Jesus was, what he stood for, and what he died for. This is the most important documentary of our time. The information it reveals will help us usher in a new era of peace for all, as described in Isaiah 11:6-9. ""They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.""We live in a dark age where over 90 billion land animals and trillions of fish are slaughtered every year. The welfare standards in factory farms, which account for 99% of farmed animals in the United States, are so abysmal that hundreds of millions of animals die before even making it to slaughter--they suffer to death from disease, starvation, dehydration, and injury. We are living through the Animal Holocaust, an atrocity of such unimaginable proportion and severity that if humanity were to receive our rightful recompense, we would be agonizingly decimated.Worldwide, over 2 billion people identify as Christian. They profess that Jesus is King, that Jesus is their Lord and Savior, yet they torture, murder, and consume the innocent and defenseless beings that Jesus died to protect. The hypocrisy is damning. Billions of people have succumbed to social conformity, indifference, and engaged in willful ignorance to turn a blind eye to the horrors we are committing against childlike beings. This world is rotten and vile, demonic and wicked--it's so bad that you can't be honest without being divisive--which is why this documentary is so critically important. Christspiracy starts an extremely important discussion that billions of religious people around the world need to face. When people realize that Jesus was fiercely against the killing and eating of animals, they will be faced with either becoming vegan or betraying Jesus.Christspiracy is exceptionally well-crafted, covering a multitude of different points and perspectives to weave together an overall narrative that is clear in its message yet not pushy, making it accessible to those who may be skeptical or resistant to this information. It's very engaging and well-paced, following the journey of Kip Andersen and Kameron Waters as they travel around the world to investigate the questions, ""Is there a spiritual way to kill an animal? How would Jesus kill an animal?"" Kip does a wonderful job providing the narration and Kameron, a Christian from the Bible Belt, offers a relatable and inspirational example of someone who pursued the truth and broke out of Christianity's carnist culture.If you want to help end the Animal Holocaust, if you care about justice and righteousness, if you want to be a part of the creation of New Earth, watch this documentary and share it with as many people as you can. Help spread this message of peace to free and protect the billions of animals that are crying out for mercy in their last terrifying moments as they are slaughtered.",True
15,10,Thought Provoking Film on the Ethics of Animal Slaughter & Consumption,kstoia-28334,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerKip Anderson's 4th exposé documentary, ""Christspiracy"" explores the ethical side of animal slaughter and consumption, diving into the questions ""Is there a spiritual way to kill an animal?"", ""How would Jesus kill an animal"", and ""Is there a Christian or Spiritual way to ethically eat animals?"".The filmmakers explore how the world's major religions view animal slaughter and consumption, interviewing leaders from a variety of religions as well as scholars, farmers, and activists. They tour farms certified ""Halal"" or ""Kosher"", while simultaneously exploring what really happened with Jesus in the ""Den of Thieves"" that ultimately led to his crucifixion. They go on to propose an alternative meaning to the word ""dominion"" as stewardship, and a responsibility to look over the created order the same way a parent would look over a child.The film explores the invisible dominant belief systems surrounding meat consumption that alters our perceptions and creates gaps in our consciousness, bringing to light the language used during times of slavery of describing slaves as ""just a dark skinned person"" or ""just a woman"" to the modern day ""just an animal"" as justification.The filmmakers really hit the mark on what is perhaps the most in-depth exploration on the moral and ethical dimensions of animal consumption, and the blinders and misconceptions many of us hold in relation to it. In doing so, the film makes what I believe is a compelling a case for abstaining from animal consumption well beyond personal health. Will be absolutely be recommending this film.",True
16,9,A film about compassion. A++,tafwilliams-85792,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just watched Christspiracy, the eye-opening film about how universal spiritual doctrines of love and peace, have been misrepresented by the religions that claim to follow them, in order to justify and perpetuate a reign of violence, for the purpose of greed.It shows how, as human beings trying to live a life of compassion, we have been manipulated to perpetuate power, through structures based on subjugation of other beings for profit.This greed/profit motive is fulfilled at the expense of our humanity, and our shared future on mother earth.I cannot recommend this film enough. It makes sense of so much and has strengthened my resolve to continue to try to live a life of compassion, a life free of harm to other beings.I invite you all to please watch it, however hard it may be, with a compassionate mind.",False
17,10,Thought provoking and interesting even for non-believers,aholbrook-76753,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have to say that I am an not religous. I do believe that Jesus existed. I personally found the film interesting and I can see that for those are asking the question: what would jesus do? It does make you think and question what jesus thought about both animal cruelty and also eating animals. I would recommend watching the film and making up your own mind. It certainly made me think and I am sure that it will make those who are spritual, kind and compassionate irrespective of their religion think too. I think the film is good at looking at religions across the board when trying to justify how culture and religion allow and promote cruelty and their inevitable death of animals to others. I got the sense that religion is very much used as a justification for harming others and that humans are on this great pedestal, which unfortunately appears to contributing to a global mass extinction. Currently, we are not stewards but instead master terminators.",False
18,10,Jesus not a historical figure but stop eating animals,dstone1028,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe most important part of this movie is to get people to understand, killing animals is wrong. It was very complelling in showing each religion and how each one handles the ethics of animals. And just how insane it is. I have a great deal of respeact for the people in the film and their part. The activists in the film were on a whole other level.The problem I have is with the history of Jesus. Jesus was not a historical figure. He was a celestial figure that was given a bio later on. As much as I wanted to believe in vegetarian Jesus, standing up for animals, because let's be honest, that makes more sense, I can't do it. I always ask people who use the bible to justify the attrocities we commit on animals, why would god give animals a brain and nervous system to feal love, fear, pain and despair, so we can chop them up into little pieces and flush them down the toilet? Alas, if there were a god, this would not go on.",True
19,9,What is humane about slaughter?,welldevine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Christspiracy is an intriguing and thought-provoking documentary that challenges its audience to critically examine the intersection of faith, morality, and compassion. As someone who isn't religious but finds religion fascinating, I found this film deeply engaging and insightful. It explores the contradictions many religious individuals face when reconciling their belief in compassion with the act of killing and their interpretation of dominion over sentient beings.The film's strength lies in its ability to provoke reflection. It highlights the moral inconsistencies in some religious practices while encouraging viewers-particularly Christians-to align their actions with the teachings of Jesus. It's not preachy but rather presents its arguments in a logical and heartfelt manner, urging believers to strive for moral consistency.With its compelling narrative and sensitive yet bold approach, *Christspiracy* is an important watch for those seeking to embody the true essence of compassion and morality in their faith. It's a challenge to live not only spiritually but ethically, and it left me reflecting long after the credits rolled.

The gentle yet 'leave no stone unturned' attitude of the filmmakers grabs me. As a hobbyist poet, I am pleased with the linguistic twists.Simultaneously, the movie raises so many questions about how humanity would have unfolded and how our societies would look like today if history had taken the other turn... I guess that is what the community that the filmmakers have created/joined is trying to live into existence.

It fearlessly uncovers the deep corruption and moral decay within certain industries and religious institutions, and I'm honestly amazed that the filmmakers managed to get it out to the public. This is the kind of content the world desperately needs-something that inspires compassion and challenges the oppressive systems shaping our lives.We've reached a critical point in history where less than 1% of the population holds the majority of power, manipulating and brainwashing us from the moment we're born. Society conditions us to fit into its expectations, and when we dare to break free or act according to our own moral compass, we're met with resistance, harassment, and immense pressure to conform. It's a system designed to suppress change and maintain control.For so many reasons-ethical, environmental, and beyond-veganism must be the future of humanity. It represents a shift toward greater compassion, justice, and sustainability, challenging the destructive norms that have dominated for far too long.

Ever since I was a child I've heard that animals don't have souls, that they are just ""robots"" (goin down to insect's), that fish don't feel pain, that wild animals like deer or wild pig or wolfs or foxes (you name it) must be killed because they can't make it on their own without it (??), and when asked to imagine a chicken, cow or pig in the wild, as children naturally imagine, adults often either get mad or ridicule the child for being ""stupid."" In all of this, these very people, hard-headedly locked into totally ridiculous beliefs, when confronted with such ideas as in that kind of documents, which simply urge one to look at animals as sentient beings, just that, say that this is the most ridiculous thing they have heard of and that only mentally ill people come up with such things. That is a serious thing in our society.I like to think that there will be more and more people like me who ate meat and defended eating meat for years, from the very reason that as children they (we) were manipulated, however, they (we) experience certain things that break through with light through the hard shell that darkens the mind with false beliefs.

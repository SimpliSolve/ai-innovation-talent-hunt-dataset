1,8,The True Picture... and more to reveal,callasif-629-778944,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yes it is the true picture... but unfortunately not all the truth is being shown due to powerful Sicilian mafias. These mafias has grown worldwide, expanding their tentacles to grab the throat of poor. They have manipulated the system, which is now supporting them, either it is bureaucracy, establishment, politicians or judiciary. Rich countries are safe havens for the looters because they are brining in the black money to their countries...... and that's the reason these rich countries do not snub them. Good thing is that voices are now being raised against this un-justice and hopefully, the sanity and truth will prevail.",False
2,9,Been waiting over a year for this,Starlight717,n/a,15/08/2025,"Anyone who follows the political landscape of Pakistan is aware of the dynast politicians running it. This documentary was supposed to expose the corruption practices that have left Pakistan in the state that it is now. A well- known journalist has been assassinated after making this. Many others are either being abducted, assassinated and tortured right now by the current facist regime (and no it's not IK who is accused of corruption in this documentary as a reviewer is trying his best to misguide).

3,9,Corruption with an Honor-guard,yassumassi,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well executed documentary where corruption, exploitation and abuse of power is used blatantly by certain anti state and anti-democracy groups within a key geopolitical country. Grease the hands of behind the curtains thugs, these players wear a veil of democracy so they can spread their agenda to their own people and the world. If and when you raise concern or voice you get terminated/assassinated like one of the investigative journalist associated with this project (Arshad Sharif).I feel for the people of mentioned country, so naÃ¯ve and fools for suffering the injustice since sixties.God Bless.",False
4,10,Arshad Shareef the True Warrior and Defender of Pakistan,anomy-46286,n/a,15/08/2025,"Exposing the bad characters of life is something really BiG because it involves a lot of risk and Arshad paid the price by giving his life but one thing is for sure that his efforts will be rewarded sooner or later.This documentary is all about Difference in Law system for the rich and poor. Law always helps the rich people in any way possible which itself is a worst thing. Poor people can't buy Law that's why they are the only one's who are affected. Equal Law system for everyone should be the basic rule of any country in order to progress, without this no country can prosper. We should always support truth no matter what.",False

It's all about corruption money.We need to create more awareness about britian being hub of money launderers.So it's a very good documentary for people living in rich countries to know that how they are destroying of countries by giving safe heavens to criminals, corrupt generals, politicians, beaurocrates and even judges.Even Pakistan chief justice to be has unexplained wealth outside Pakistan and he is involved in everything with current establishment.",False
6,10,credibility of this documentary,asaadghani,n/a,15/08/2025,Credibility of this documentary is that a journalist lost his life for making this documentary. #ArshadSharif was the bravest investigative journalist of Pakistan. Shame on all those journalists around world who kept silence on his cold blood murder in Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª. He was shot in the head. Fake encounter. Family of arshad sharif still not able to register FIR. Lawyers withdrawn from the case. Court stuck. Jit didnt complete its work. No TV channel in pakistan can raise voice for him nor any journalist can ask questions on details of his murder. This documentary will disclose that how corrupt mafia works in third world country and how Powerful stake holders back those mafia families. How mafia can blackmail anyone even they can blackmail judges cops lawyers.,False
7,10,Arshad sharif you were worth so much,wardahajmal-37962,n/a,15/08/2025,"In the loving memory of arshad sharif who tried to expose the dirty games nawaz and family had been playing and got him murdered.We as a pakistani nation have lost many souls in this war againt the forced rulers but Arshad sharif was the saddest one.This documentary is a tight slap on the face of every corrupted politician who think they can get away with almost everything.Let God do His job, stop playing God on His earth. May all the corrupted politicians rot in the deepest pits of hell and i pray they end up getting diseases that will kill them very painfully but slowly.May God grant Arshad sharif the highest raanks in heaven and i pray his family finds peace.",False
8,n/a,"Unveiling the Secrets of Power and Corruption: ""Behind Closed Doors"" Sheds Light on PEPs and Stolen Wealth",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I recently watched the eye-opening documentary, ""Behind Closed Doors,"" and it had a profound impact on me. The film explores the world of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and exposes the risks associated with corruption and bribery.""Behind Closed Doors"" uncovers how PEPs exploit British finance and offshore jurisdictions to launder and hide their wealth. It reveals how London becomes their hub for buying properties, taking legal action, and starting anew after their downfall.What sets this documentary apart is its focus on a developing country's fight to reclaim stolen money from Britain. It showcases the determination of those challenging the system and demanding justice.The film combines powerful storytelling with compelling evidence, educating viewers about corruption's complex web. It raises important questions about the responsibility of financial institutions and governments.I highly recommend this documentary to anyone seeking insight into corruption, offshore finance, and the pursuit of justice. It's a wake-up call that urges us to advocate for transparency and accountability. Get ready to be enlightened and moved by the hidden truths behind power and wealth.",False
9,10,Definitely worth watching,usamamaqsood-49523,n/a,15/08/2025,The documentary is a good depiction of how a country has been destroyed by industrialist crooks and murderers to whom their factories and businesses matter more than the country. I highly recommend everyone to watch this as it will be an eye opener for people who consider politicians some sacred cows. The journalist behind this documentary was also killed in cold blood in Kenya by Kenyan police. The family of the journalist has still not been served justice. I really hope that we can get more documentaries produced like this and be readily available to public on platforms like netflix and youtube etc. So everyone can access and watch it.,False

11,1,Highly propaganda documentary,urdusmsfree,n/a,15/08/2025,"Documentary based on views of one political party, it's highly propaganda and biased documentary. Authentic documentary should contain the views of both parties. In short we could say that, ""Behind the Closed Door"" falls short of its promise to provide an unbiased exploration of its matter. Instead, the documentary promotes a biased narrative, selectively represents information, and fails to include alternative viewpoints. Its lack of fact-checking, emotional manipulation, and dismissal of counterarguments further undermine its credibility. As responsible consumers of media, it is essential to approach such documentaries critically and seek out alternative sources that provide a more balanced perspectiv.",False
12,10,Eye opening,sanaenv-33625,n/a,15/08/2025,"Arshad Sharif, journalist from Pakistan, gave his life for this documentary. It's spectacular. I wish we could do smth about rampant corruption all over the world. It's us the middle class which suffers. It's our money they steal. But most of us are so placent. We are okay with it. Corruption ate Africa. It's eating much of Asia.

Arshad Sharif a Pakistani journalist who was shot and killed in Kajiado, Kenya, by local police on 23 October 2022.

14,10,A failed state,immranyounis,n/a,15/08/2025,"Freedom of expression, a promised right under article 19 of the constitution; the state here again fails. Journalists are being forcefully silenced, public speakers are banned to be spoken and media channels are off-aired for not lining up according to the wills and wishes of the people in corridors of power. Maltreatment and politically motivated cases against journalists Imran Riaz Khan, Arshad Shareef and many others are a slap on the face of Pakistan's democracy.Elevating from the individual level to the national; unfortunately, the state has failed in economic, social and political spheres of life. At present, Pakistan's economy is on the way to default. There are no signs of recovery from the ongoing imbroglio. Inflation is at a historically high rate of 42 percent.",False
15,10,Exceptional Documentary,saira-15284,n/a,15/08/2025,"A documentary that exposes the ugly reality and truth of the ruling elite that have destroyed nations, this being very well true for Pakistan.

17,10,Shareef family corruption is at world record,mahmad-61177,n/a,15/08/2025,Respected journalist Arshad Shareef was brutally tortured and killed as he exposed Shareef family corruption. It is very sad that journalist still did not get the justice from Pakistan. Shareef family Mafia is extremely strong in Pakistan and overseas and no one can expose their corruption as they can easily kill anyone and anywhere in the world. Arshad Shareef was brave but lost his life as a result. We strongly support this documentary and appeal the world to take action. Shareef family has properties all over the world and currently Nawaz Sharif is residing in London UK. Big shame for UK government that they are keeping gangsters and criminals like Nawaz Sharif in UK and not taking any action.,False

19,10,Incredible,enggned,n/a,15/08/2025,"Revealing the negative aspects of life is a highly risky endeavour, and Arshad paid the price by losing his life, but his efforts will be repaid sooner or later, it is certain.This documentary is all about how the legal systems for the wealthy and the poor differ. Law always favors the wealthy, which is a bad thing in and of itself. The only ones who are impacted are the poor since they cannot afford the law. Every nation should have an equal legal system as its fundamental tenet because without it, no nation can advance. No matter what, we should always support the truth. Pakistani journalist Arshad Sharif sacrificed his life for this documentary. It's incredible. I wish there was something we could do about the widespread corruption in the globe. We, the middle class, are the ones that suffer. Our money is being stolen. Yet the majority of us are so placental. We don't mind at all. Corruption ate Africa. Asia is being devoured by it. There won't be much left for our kids if we let these fat bald men and women continue to gorge all this wealth.",False

I am glad imdb team have plugged the courage and educate the world about how the 3rd world country leaders who comes in power with people's votes suddenly become rich elites and start amassing huge swathe of wealth in offshore setup companies. This documentary also highlights the fact, how the western democracies turn blind eye to this corruption and let the corrupt leaders and the families of third world country leaders gain access to diplomatic support and later residency and citizenship visas. The nexus of western governments is also exposed subliminally in this documentary.",False

It is the greatest work done by him for us and future generations of Pakistan.He exposes the international nexus of Corrupt Pakistani elites , politicians , army generals and bussiness mans. No one dares to speak in Pakistan against corrupt and corruption because corrupt group of society is rulling the country for decades who makes the rule to protect themselves.When corrupt wrote the law, decide the decisions in courts, build the police and army to sheild themselves so in this environment and society who will dare to speak.There was only one man who stood against the system fearless and brave like a lion, like warrior in war who prefer to die instead to surrender.Mr Arshad Shareef
You will always be in our hearts and minds.",False
24,10,Best documentary of the decade,asiaharoon,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was deeply moved to tears as I watched this poignant documentary that shed light on a distressing reality. The Shareef family has once again assumed power as the ruling party, despite a harrowing incident in which Arshad Shareef, a brave soul who dared to expose their wrongdoings, met a tragic end. To compound the anguish, approximately 15,000 individuals find themselves incarcerated for exercising their democratic right to protest against the reign of the Shareef clan.This somber documentary unveiled a narrative of profound injustice, where power seems to overshadow truth and dissent is met with severe consequences. The story serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by those who dare to speak out against entrenched corruption and abuse of authority.The documentary's powerful depiction of the suffering endured by those who oppose the Shareef family's rule evoked a deep sense of empathy and despair within me. It underscored the urgent need for upholding human rights, safeguarding freedom of expression, and fostering an environment where voices of dissent are heard and valued.As I reflected upon the documentary's narrative, it became apparent that the struggle for justice and accountability is an arduous one. It highlighted the profound resilience and courage exhibited by those who stand up against oppression, even in the face of grave personal risks.May this documentary serve as a catalyst for greater awareness, compassion, and advocacy, igniting a collective call for change and shining a light on the plight of those unjustly silenced. May we strive towards a future where integrity, transparency, and the safeguarding of fundamental rights prevail over the oppressive forces that seek to stifle progress and perpetuate injustice.",False

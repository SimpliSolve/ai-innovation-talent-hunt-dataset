1,7,"Not Bad, Could've Been Better",rahn_enterprises,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed this film, it is not your average, run of the mill, Bigfoot documentary. The biggest let down, for me, was they did not show images, video footage, or audio, when they were discussing a certain case. Being able to see the images or footage or hearing the sounds, would have made their points more clear.",False
2,7,Not what i thought it would be,kathyd777,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was good.... not what i was expecting though. Mostly just talking.... i was hoping to see some footage or anything to go along with that talking. I have the exact same views as these guys so i did enjoy listening to them, especially Matthew. Thanks for explaining about why the lack of evidence!!",False
3,7,A Bigfoot collectors item,Carlinientertainment,n/a,16/08/2025,"For someone who knows almost nothing about Bigfoot, this film was very informative, from experts that you can tell know what they are talking about. I learned a lot!",False
4,1,A couple of anthropology novices...,tyvo79,n/a,16/08/2025,"...speculate on modern day ""sightings"" with nothing more than ""feeling"" as evidence and high school level editing. It's embarrassing and would be totally hilarious if it weren't frighteningly misinformed and misleading. It's worse than Ancient Aliens.",False
5,9,Fascinating and thought-provoking,JCanni68,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're looking for an introduction to bigfoot, this might just be the definitive documentary. The interviewees were top-notch and authoritative on the subject, and present compelling arguments that will challenge skepticism. I appreciated the film's thoughtfulness, sincerity and level-headedness. The depth of insights and strength of theories surprised me. I came into the film a doubter, but left genuinely open to the possibility of a bigfoot's existence...",False
6,9,Interesting documentary!,antoinepana,n/a,16/08/2025,I thought this documentary was very well put together and gives you interesting insights on the search for this iconic creature. It makes you think wonder! There are some truely disturbing testimonies on possible sightings of the beast!,False
7,9,Interesting Info from Knowledgeable Subjects,wjaywill,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis doc was full of interesting information and opinions about Bigfoot and cryptozoology. The main two subjects that were interviewed seemed to be experts in this niche field. It was better than a lot of those lame shows on History Channel because the film never claimed that they were going out to find Bigfoot for 2 hours and end up finding nothing. It mostly talks about the possibility of Bigfoot existing and what sort of environment and conditions it would need in order to survive and remain mostly hidden. I do wish there were a few more accounts or some on-location shooting with the experts out in nature, but overall there was definitely a lot of good information to absorb.",True
8,8,Obsessed Big Foot Lovers...,kennyhughes,n/a,16/08/2025,I knew nothing about Bigfoot or cryptozoology. Both are pretty interesting. I enjoyed getting to learn why folks believe or not in the BIG FOOT. Two main guys are the primary sources of info and both seem earnest and know enough to be interesting to me. I enjoyed contemplating the talks on what Bigfoot would need to exist. It seemed like a good gateway piece. It is indie feeling but I enjoy that spirit. I may actually look up some more on the topic and delve in deeper..,False
9,8,Strong Doc,derrickfury-876-127358,n/a,16/08/2025,Don't Call Me Bigfoot is a solid documentary about the mystery and cultural significants surrounding Sasquatch. The experts that are interviewed are all interesting characters in their own right and the film itself explore some interesting points of view surrounding the urban legend himself. Definitely worth a watch.,False
10,9,Good documentary to watch,Goingpro12,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a very interesting and informational documentary about Bigfoot. Even though I didn't believe in Bigfoot it really makes u think if he really was around at or time. Very good information that makes u think twice,False
11,8,"Bigfoot, Bigfoot, Sasquatch!",GilbertS-85,n/a,16/08/2025,"My neighbor last week told his son (during the shelter in place) about Bigfoot and regretted it. The story came off as so realistic that his kid has refused to leave the house regardless of how many times his father tells him the story is not real. Wait, is the story real?I had no idea about the field of cryptozoology and the first-hand stories concerning Bigfoot. The interviews in the movie cover topics that include first-hand encounters, bone dispersal theories, conferences, and migration patterns. Don't Call Me Bigfoot is a deep dive into cryptozoology's prized topic on the specific Bigfoot species. For me, this was the best place to explore the ideas and possibilities of Bigfoot -- excuse me, Sasquatch.",False
12,9,This is a good overall overview of Bigfoots & how to stay safe.,kfboyde,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well obviously negative comments are old or just stupid. Watch ""Alaskan Killer Bigfoot"" (true story of individuals killed in Portlock, Alaska), ""These Woods are Haunted"", & ""Expedition Bigfoot"" created in the last two years. Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Yeti, etc. Have all the same habits of turning trees upside down, horrible smell, throwing stones, weird wood structure, etc. Give some credence to Native American stories, indigenous tribes all over the world stories, rural Americans. It's real & all over the world.",False
13,8,I love these things,davidrfable,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like to watch these things about UFOs, haunted houses, ghosts and Bigfoot. This documentary takes a very reasoned and scholarly approach to the existence of Bigfoot. If you like these sorts of explorations, take a look at this one.",False
14,8,Informative expert testimony and well executed,tucia,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an informative and enlightening documentary about the ever-fascinating legend of Bigfoot. As a paranormal theology buff myself, I can say that this feature provides very insightful information from credible experts that helps distinguish fact from fiction and explores some compelling sightings that are hard to explain. It also does a good job establishing that the lack of evidence does not negate the fact that Bigfoot may actually exist. Intriguing content and well executed.",False
15,10,Makes me wonder,frankenyolandi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ok, so I am not someone who believes in big foot... or anything like that. But I thought it would be interesting to watch for pure entertainment purposes. Entertaining it was indeed! But the researchers are actual quite... well, knowledgeable? and make some great points. I won't say I am there yet, but I can say that maybe I am willing to listen more :) This doco makes you think and it makes you part of the sow. A great escape from reality and I thoroughly enjoyed it!",False
16,8,A big foot mystery,mahayanafilms,n/a,16/08/2025,Since i was a child was always interested in the big foot and believed that they existed in the Himalayas....This documentary does open my heart to those possibilities.....Thanks for making me dream again....Would have loved to see some actual footage....Well worth the watch though...,False
17,8,A Bigfoot by any another name still makes an intriguing story,jimlewisjr,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary exposes the many aspects of elusive Bigfoot and their sightings around the world as told by experts and the people that have tracked them. When will Bigfoot be found, it is only a matter of time.",False
18,10,Bigfoot Fan Film,gregwolk,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found this documentary very interesting and illuminating. Do I believe it all? Nope. Did I enjoy hearing everyone's views? Definitely. A well-crafted piece of filmmaking for anyone who loves Bigfoot or is simply curious, as I was.",False
19,8,Intelligent Doc!,UrbanElysium,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Sasquatch documentaries! I'm fascinated with the concept of The Sasquatch creature and I just love mythology in general!This is set apart from all the stupid 'let's hunt down Bigfoot' crap.These guys present the lore, history and criptid phenomenon in a very well done manner! üëçSo if you want a more intelligent doc then watch this one!",False
20,10,very well done documentary!,imjustjaded,n/a,16/08/2025,"I grew up on bigfoot stories where my father was an enthusiast and had 2 encounters himself and I have watched most of the documentary on the topic you can find online and streaming. I found that the people interview were very knowledgeable and I really liked their viewpoints especially on how bigfoot might view us. Reminds me allot of how my father would describe, what he called his ""harry friend"". If you are a believer this is a must watch, if you are a skeptic it is still a must watch and might give you a more realistic point of view.",False

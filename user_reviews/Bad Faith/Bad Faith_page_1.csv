2,9,Everyone Should See This,thalassafischer,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I am one of the people who already knew a lot of this stuff (and the reels and reels of information they had to cut I guess for brevity's sake like Barry Goldwater's role in The Southern Strategy and how Reagan expanded it) this documentary needs to be seen by everyone.In fact I found it strange that they also didn't mention Project 2025 which is widespread and available for everyone to see, just go to the website to witness the Christian Nationalist terror OPENLY afoot. As of today mainstream media is talking about how Trump Republicans want complete control of the government which is not how our US government is meant to work. We have established checks and balances for a reason, every 10th grader who passed World Civ should know that.There's no conspiracy theories here just for information on just how far back this stretches with the Moral Majority in the 70s and 80s. If anything, pertinent information is missing.",False
3,9,Christian Nationalism,jms_mckelvey,n/a,16/08/2025,"This folks is some scary stuff. They have been setting the wheels in motion for years. I'm not the biggest fan of Biden. But I'm an even lesser fan of MAGA or anyone endorsed by him and his ilk. This documentary is very thorough and exposes these people and their agenda.You can rent this on Amazon Prime for a dollar. It's well worth it to see these Christian Nationalists for what they are. They want to completely control everyone and everything. They are like our version of The Taliban. It follows along like Project 2025 without really saying anything about it. It's well done and everyone should watch this. Also ignore the two negative especially the one that says pure propaganda trash, reviews. This was a well done documentary.",False
4,9,Frustrating and frightening,Katz5,n/a,16/08/2025,"To quote Barry Goldwater, hardly a ""liberal Democrat"":
""Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the (Republican) party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to deal with them.""And here we are, December 2024, a month away from the inauguration of the second non-consecutive term of a convicted felon who nearly half the country blindly support, millions even saying he was ""sent by God."" This infuriating but essential documentary explains how we got here. The seeds were planted in the post-Nixon mid 70s by John Bircher Dominionists like Paul Weyrich and Jerry Falwell, both of whom rose to political prominence under Reagan. The documentary fails to mention Jim Watt, who in addition to canceling the ""bad influencers,"" the Beach Boys, from their annual July 4th National Mall concerts, was a devout Dominionist and hater of all things related to environmental protection. And now, the ghosts of these people (Falwell Sr., Weyrich, Watt, Reagan and also brimstone and hellfire nutjobs like Pat Robertson) are beaming from hell at the destruction a second Trump term is bound to unleash in Regime #2.Republicans/MAGA blather on about ""the Swamp"" and ""Deep State"" in Washington. Christian Nationalism, which is really code for the KKK, and Evangelical Dominionism is the actual Deep State in Washington. The swamp is about to get deeper with zealots like Mike Johnson, who flies a Christian Nationalist flag (not an American flag) outside his office in the Capitol, leading the charge. Negative reviews from users are clearly from MAGAs and other snake oil believers who will not accept a separation of church and state in this country, as the Founding Fathers proclaimed. Boebert says that's ""junk,"" so that ends that.A staggering documentary that should have been streaming nonstop before the November 2024 Election. Welcome to Gilead, America.",False
5,9,Absolutely sick,Kepart,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely sick. Especially the end when Jan 6 occurred and the mother of Ashli Babbitt insurrectionist had the gall to say that Capitol Police murdered her. These were not peaceful protestors. They were armed and were threatening any government official attending an official government ceremony. Instead of mounting legal attacks, MAGA chose lethal attacks. Now we are stuck with an absolutist president. Absolutely sick, that Republican leaders chose to reject all common sense and glorify in the attack on Capitol Police and government employees who may never overcome their physical or mental injuries. Absolutely sick for Republican leaders and influencers to parrot the foul-mouthed cheeto puff who just conned people out of money, just so he can proclaim that he is rich. Trump squandered his father's money, like any other self-important, hedonistic rich kid. And Trump's ""blessed"" appointed government officials are just that. There is not a shred of decency or Christian piety that can be recognized. They lie behind the Cross, claiming that Republican morality is better than Democrat morality. I am expecting a sequel, especially on Pete Hegseth.",False
6,10,Not for those who are unable/refuse to critically think,dangshaynadang,n/a,16/08/2025,"And that is where the problem lies. Reasoning skills and critical thought. The American education system needs an overhaul of full thought intervention. Children need to learn empathy, reasoning skills, and how to detect lie from truth.This documentary sheds a lot of light on the Christian Nationalist infiltration of the republican party. How it continues to mold those who cannot/will not pull themselves back and view the world in a different lens.I especially enjoyed seeing the Christians of our country truely following the word of Jesus condemn and shame those with manipulative intent to gain power and suppression through their very own religion.This documentary is one that should be spoken and watched with family members and friends who are stuck in that right wing thought tunnel.",False
7,9,The real people pulling trump's strings!,legrand-walter5,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this thing on Facebook and then a lady recommended it so I started watching it on my break at work. I couldn't finish it until I got home. It did make me mad at first. It also proved my point about Donald Trump, his supporters and his backers. These people aren't Christians but they used Christ for their agendas which has nothing to do with Christ. Christ isn't about hate and fear! He's not about making you wealthy from lies and corruption! This documentary proves that these folks that follow trump doesn't care about truth or Christ! I believe that everybody should watch this because it proves that the same ideas of today are the same ideas from the past! The reason never changes just the people! The idea never changes just the people!",False
8,10,Everyone needs to watch this,c-scott-lindauer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was an excellent, disturbing and compelling documentary about the rise of Christian nationalism in America.This documentary showed and proved support of the assertion that America is under attack by Christian Nationalists who desire to turn America into a theocracy ran by a chosen wealthy elite to create further disparity of rights among the citizens.It'll tell you what the Christian nationalists are doing and how they have duped several and are actively suppressing others' voices and votes to succeed in their cause of ruling and controlling the country to turn it into a twisted Christian theocracy controlled by minority the minority and to be able force convert its citizens.Everyone should see this before Election Day.",True
9,10,The TRUTH is here to see,bill-30-465807,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHaving lived through all the years that this video covers I can now clearly see how everything we thought we were achieving relative to liberty, freedom, equality has been actively plotted against by evangelicals and big business to destroy American democracy. The real truth is here and it's well past time that we wake up to it if we ever want to actually realize the kind and loving ways our founding fathers actually had in mind for us. It is NOT anti-religion, but it does show the perversion of religious ideals combining with big oil money to advance the goals of white christian nationalism. Must see!",True
10,9,Educational Material,joe-bedell,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before you vote, you should watch this. The key to a functioning democracy is education and critical thinking skills. This video at least gives the viewer somewhere to start when preparing the basis for their electoral choices in the coming and all subsequent elections. While this movie may not replace what good Economics and Civics classes should be taught, it still provides enough information to allow the viewer what is afoot from certain quarters. I encourage EVERYONE to engage your curiosity to see what this is all about. I apologize for any and all redundancy in this review but the character minimum is driving that well after my point was made.",False
11,5,Totally Misses The Real Threat - Democracy Itself,carlupq-34059,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is rather funny how this entire film exposes Stephen Ujlaki's ignorance of how PEACE is derived among mankind. HINT: it's not democracy. Democracy is what has created this ugly binary of competing horror we enjoy today and marginalizes those intellectual heirs of America who DO understand where peace comes from.Yes, a powerful force of christian nationalism is indeed a threat, but not TO ""democracy"" but BECAUSE OF democracy. A democracy that wields power it SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD. (see America's Counter-Revolution: The Constitution Revisited by Sheldon Richman)
If one wanted to end this threat by christian nationalism, one must look seriously at WHY democracy enables it, but this film looks PAST that fact.This film could have proposed the cure to their stated problem by proposing the US initiate and pass a Separation of State & Economy amendment which would instantly close the loophole, not just for christian nationalism, but authoritarian nationalism of ANY FLAVOR, and this government would become limited to its original intent - the objective protection of individual rights of every single individual. The entire industry of political lobbying and political news-making would be permanently sidelined because there is no central authoritative power to be bought or brokered.Imagine that - no centralized bully in DC or state capitols. A scary thought indeed. Now that is a documentary this creator should take up next!",False
12,9,A must watch documentary about Christian Nationalism,Zhongchao,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have read a handful of books and over a dozen journal articles about Christian Nationalism and Dominion theology. This documentary is a really great representation of the scholarship. They have done a great job on the music, transitions, and in general, editing of this documentary.This documentary will tell you about the history of Christian Nationalism. It is a movement with big money and run by a minority group of Christians who want America to be run their way. I highly recommend this documentary to anyone who is unfamiliar with Christian Nationalilsm, the Republican Party since the 1980s, and anyone who is generally interested in recent American history and/or politics.",False
13,1,Awful ..wish I could have time back,Wolf1101,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an absolutely ridiculous documentary. People should actually study history because there were so many things that led up events mentioned that were not about Christianity. It was just a waste of time I would say skip it and save yourself an afternoon. Don't buy into all the fear mongering it seems like that's all anyone can do. Anymore is constantly create fear and division among people in this country.Research the events in history, particularly why abortions and eugenics. It will shock you.Life is a journey in full of experiences. You have to be more discerning and dig for truth and not just simple documentaries that try and pass them off as truth.",False
14,10,Everyone should watch this!,tomthomas-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is educational and should be viewed by everyone that has any interest in our country's democracy or what is really going on inside MAGA. Never mind if you are a self proclaimed Patriot or an extreme left leaning liberal. It's not about left or right, it's about democracy itself. The film proves that Christian Nationalism is a growing movement looking to rule the country, even though they're a minority. Christians are not a majority in the US, nor was the country founded on Christianity, despite what some on the right would have you believe. Paul Weyrich lit the fire through the issue of abortion, conjoining evangelicals and Catholics, and fanned the flames into the January 6th insurrection and beyond. There is much more to that event than meets the eye and this documentary sheds light on the facts and events behind the scenes that led up to January 6th. Most importantly, the film teaches us that we need to protect our democracy before it is too late.",True

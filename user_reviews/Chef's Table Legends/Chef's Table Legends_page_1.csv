2,10,Culinary art beautifully captured. Soul nurturing.,wandalboggs,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLike music, food connects us all, and this is such exemplary proof. I was not expecting to be so touched and so moved by these legends' stories and their journeys, including their care and concern for the community and the world by taking action with their compassion and talent. These episodes are so well documented and so well produced and directed: The art. The love. The creativity. The passion. The dedication. The growth. The heart. The tiniest of details going into that perfect meal, that perfect bite to create a perfect moment and experience.""And I remember cooking a roast dinner on my own once. I remember my dad patting me on the back, and my hairs went (hand on his neck and inhales), and I'm like, 'Oh, I like that feeling.' I felt empowered. I felt free. I'm gonna keep cooking."" - Chef Jamie Oliver""Love trumps hate. But you have to work hard for love. It takes years and decades and generations to build something great. It takes very little of hate to destroy something amazing. I want food to be the solution."" - José Andrés""The real purpose of cooking became evident - to make people happy."" - Chef Thomas Keller""So from that moment on when people told me that it's impossible to do something, immediately the french phrase came to my mind: Impossible is not a word in the french language."" - Chef Alice Waters.",True
3,5,"When Food Becomes Ego, Not Nourishment - A Wake-Up Call to Netflix's ""Chef's Table: The Legends""",martinuejacque,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cried watching Alice Waters. Not out of sadness - but because in her face, her food, her gentleness - I saw truth.She doesn't just serve food. She grows it, teaches it, shares it. With farmers. With children. With young chefs. She doesn't shout. She listens.That's real leadership.And then I think of Thomas Keller, Gordon Ramsay, and the rest of the ""chef gods"" canonized on Chef's Table. Loud, rigid, obsessive. Celebrated not for feeding souls, but for controlling teams and perfecting ""micro meals"" on $300 plates. And we're told this is culinary excellence?No. This is a hierarchy. A boys' club. A template where power and precision replace humility and heart.Meanwhile, Alice quietly paid every member of her kitchen equally. She made kids feel food. She connected eating to the earth, not to ego. No stars needed.So why do we keep glorifying ego-driven chefs when we should be uplifting the Alice Waters, the José Andrés, the Vikas Khannas - the ones who serve?Netflix, do better. Food is meant to nurture, not intimidate.HASHTAGS / TAGS:#RealFoodCulture #AliceWaters #ChefstableCritique #FoodIsLoveNotEgo #CancelCulinaryElitism #ChezPanisse #FeedPeopleNotEgos #VikasKhanna #JoséAndrés #FoodJustice #EgoInFineDining #SlowFoodMovement #NetflixWakeUp #IMDBReviews #FoodForChange.",False

1,4,Irresponsible filmmaking,thayn,n/a,16/08/2025,"The filmmakers tell a story about a fundamentalist splinter group and never bother to explain that the group is not associated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS church) - instead using the derogatory term 'Mormon' throughout the show. Either the filmmakers were irresponsible or just ignorant of the basic concepts of their subjects. The errors were so glaring that it distracts from the overall watch. The lack of a narrator makes the show feel like poor quality TV. The shots and image quality are good and clean, the in 4K and of good production quality. I don't think I'd recommend this show.",False
2,5,Over speak a pain,imdbfan-0963848556,n/a,16/08/2025,"For whatever reason, there's this invisible commentator that talks throughout each episode-my settings can't stop that narration. And it gets to the point of being ridiculous-""Man stands looking out his back door"" or ""Woman's hair blows gently in the wind""---yes, I can see that, thank you very much.Everyone has their own opinion about the Mormon church-but one thing's for sure-you google ""Mormon murders"" and there is just so much that pops up...something to think about, most definitely. Over the course of each episode, it becomes almost obvious why this horrific crime happened. The viewer sits there and just thinks, ""Why didn't you all get out sooner? You knew there were those that did not want you there""...but they didn't listen and this happened.",False

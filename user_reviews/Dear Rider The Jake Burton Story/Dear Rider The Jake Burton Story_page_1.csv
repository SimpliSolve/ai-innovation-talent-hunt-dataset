1,8,Tried and True Formula With Heart,chrisjmijares,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jake Burton of Burton Snowboards fame is the subject of Dear Rider. I found the film to be informative and engaging. Not just a bio of Jake, but a solid primer on the evolution of modern snowboarding. A documentary with some great visuals and lots of heart. 8/10.",False
2,9,Loved it,killercola,n/a,15/08/2025,It's a great documentary. Not just about The Godfather of snowboarding but shows the history and evolution of the sport. If you're into snowboarding this is a must watch.,False
3,10,This Sums All Of Us Riders Up In One Film,paul-reich22,n/a,15/08/2025,The film makers nailed it. Jake was the real deal. We identified so much with Burton and snowboarding that we've passed it down to our children. Now it's mainstream- the opposite of what it was when we had to fight to get on the ski mountains. We love you Jake and thank you for helping us through a tough time as teens in the mid-eighties.,False
4,10,40+ Years of Shred,bono-45637,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very cool doc on Jake. What a well rounded, goal oriented man. 2 of my high school friends from Michigan drove to Vermont back in 84 and knocked on Jakes door and asked him to sponsor them. He didn't do it on the spot, but asked them to meet him at Stowe the next day to see how they road. Well enough, as he sponsored them that day. One of them was featured in the doc getting a award at the end of the US Open. That just goes to show you what a cool, easy going guy he was.I used to buy boards and Burton clothing samples from the grey long haired bearded dude (world ambassador) interviewed in the doc as well. He was the rep for the midwest in the 80's/90's.I wish I had the opportunity to meet Jake, but never had a chance. RIP and thanks for opening the world to the coolest snow sport on the planet.",False
5,6,"""Badass grandfather of snowboarding""",paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""Dear Rider (2021 release; 95 min.) opens, we are at ""Vail, Colorado, February 29, 2020"", site of the Burton US Open for snowboarding, and people are paying tribute to Jake Burton Carpenter, the ""badass grandfather of snowboarding"", according to one of the current pro snowboarders. We then go back in time, as Jake talks about growing up on Long Island. He had a dream of ""surfing on snow"" at a young age that eventually drove his passion for snowboarding, except that snowboarding didn't really exist. At this point we are 10 min into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is directed by Fernando Villena (""Giving Voice""). The movie's title refers to open letter that Jake writes each year for the company's catalog, always starting with ""Dear Rider"" (and finishing with ""Jake""). Let me state upfront that I am not a snowboarder, and that I had never heard of Jake Burton Carpenter before. The documentary is as much about growing snowboarding as a sport than it is how to build a snowboard manufacturing company (Burton Boards) into a dominant force in the industry. Along the way we of course get a very personal closeup about Jake and his wife Donna, who married in 1983. I certainly appreciate that Jake built something substantial, and that snowboarding today may be more popular than skiing, but does this make for a compelling documentary? While the documentary certainly is not 'bad', neither is this truly memorable. For example, when I compare this to the recent documentary mini-series ""100 Foot Wave', I can't help but conclude that for me (and I realize that this is a subjective assessment and that others may feel differently), ""Dear Rider"" isn't anywhere near as compelling as ""100 Foot Wave"".""Dear Rider"" premiered on HBO earlier this week, and is now available on HBO On Demand and soon as well on other streaming platforms (and eventually also on DVD/Blu-ray). If you have any interest in snowboarding, be it the sport or the business side of things, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
6,10,Its a documentary for snowboarders.,speach-48162,n/a,15/08/2025,"For the Paul's out there, its a documentary that was made for snowboarders who didn't really know too much as what Jake burton was about aside for being friendly person but terrifying hard worker. Not many really knew of his more personal life or what his health issues were, its never really been fully public. Its also for the general public to know who Jake burton was, its not ment to be over dramatic like the 100 foot wave. Its truly a movie just for core snowboarders just to understand if there wasn't for Jake burton, snowboarding wouldn't really exist like it does today and the ski hills would of died out of elitist uptight welthy skiers and their hopes for their kids to be the fastest racer at the Olympics. Its not ment to be compared, just appreciated and a way to help celebrate who Jake burton was. Why there is a day dedicated to him like go skate day.",False
7,10,Captures the essence,nickts-03951,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love how the film covers the whole spectrum of history, including the early days. Jake is a legend forever. The film left me very uplifted, and had some excellent footage of the action.",False

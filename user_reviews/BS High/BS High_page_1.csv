1,7,"""I am the most honest liar that I know""",paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs ""BS High"" (2023 release; 97 min.) opens, it is ""Los Angeles, February 2022"", and Roy Johnson, the coach and overall brains behind the fake Bishop Sycamore High School football team is talking to the film makers. We then switch to ESPN footage of the game between IMG Academy and Bishop Sycamore, in which the latter is simply demolished, and it's not long thereafter that a Columbus Dispatch reporter exposes the scam. At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from Oscar winning co-directors Martin Desmond Roe and. Travon Free (""Two Distant Strangers""). Here they reassess what led to the inexcusable scandal that was the fake school and fake football team playing on national TV. The film makers go back to the very beginning, and how it ballooned from there. There are lots of guilty parties involved, but none more so than Roy Johnson, who shamelessly takes advantage of disillusioned kids with a dream to play college football. Johnson's ego knows no boundaries. ""Do I look like a con artist?"" he asks the film makers. The answer is obvious. Later on, Johnson comments with a straight face ""I am the most honest liar that I know"" after he is exposed on multiple other charges including domestic violence. Other guilty parties along the way include ESPN and IMG Academy, none of which apparently did any serious due diligence on Bishop Sycamore before agreeing to stage and participate in the televised game, all for sake of money. Sadly, the State of Ohio (where the fake school was based) doesn't come out very well either (where is the oversight?). The biggest hurt is inflicted on the Bishop Sycamore kids, one more than the other, when the house of cards comes crumbling down. One can only hope that Roy Johnson never sets foot again near kids of any age. How this man can sleep at night, I have no idea.""BS High"" premiered at this year's Tribeca Film Festival to good critical acclaim. It started airing on HBO and streaming on Max a few days ago. If you want to understand how a narcissistic scammer can build a fake football tame out of a non-existing school, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",True
2,7,Child Abuse,huskydad,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a story about a mentally ill man that financial, mentally and emotionally abused kids. You could say that he physically abused them by putting them in dangerous situations. The state of Ohio should be ashamed of themselves for not holding this man accountable for the abuse he committed to these boys that may impact them for the rest of their lives. The amount of greed and cover up would be immense if it were not for social media. ESPN and the documentary makers will financially benefit off of these kids. It's hard to watch this narcissist explain himself for 90 minutes while laughing away. Left me feeling pretty bad.",False
3,7,NICE ATEMPT - INTERESTING BUT FLAWED,stevesky-15087,n/a,16/08/2025,"A thoughroughly interesting story that took some time to get started if you (a) aren't an american and don't understand the American Football and education system and (b) didn't know the story. The amazing thing is how the scum bag Roy isn't in jail. His manipulation and damage he's done to everyone he's ever met is palpable. Its also incredible that he's still walking. A truer sociopath, narcissists and selfish, remorseless being you could never meet. The failing of this documentary is that the directors did not punish him enough with cross examination during interviews. I understand that film makers need to placate the subject until they don't need him any more for their film, but I wanted to see more of his suffering on camera. The biggest question is why would he be part of this doc in the first place... but that tells you everything you need to know about this selfish, self centred ego.I wish nothing but ill will for this despicable manchild for the rest of his miserable life. The only good thing is that people like this always get what they deserve in the end. He's like a Don King without the money. As for the film, we'll put together and shot. It's simple stuff though, so anyone with half a brain could have shot it. There's no imaginative direction here. A worthwhile 90 mins.",False
4,7,Shocking is an understatement. Its just wild this happens and might keep happening.,KinoBuff2021,n/a,16/08/2025,"'BS High' (2023) is entertaining but only due to the shocking story of how a football school can be created out of nothing and compete against the best teams despite not being legit.Bishop Sycamore High School led by Roy Johnson is/was not an actual high school or prep school for sports. It is probably the most notorious example of a ""fake"" school in recent years. No academics or standards just immature leadership governing young men who were seeking opportunity and guidance. This type of fake sport school exists outside of football with ice hockey being another notable example, but Roy Johnson misled not just players and their families, but duped a nation of athletic directors, coaches, and major news networks like ESPN.This documentary will show you the horrifying character that Roy Johnson is. He speaks honestly and yet lies the whole time. He admits fault and opens up but we can't know what really happened because his word is just so convincing.Whether you love amateur athletics or pure drama, this documentary will keep you entertained (although mostly from anger). Its worth taking the time to watch it and might just stick with you the next time you watch high school athletics.",False
5,7,Good documentary showing how people can use kids in the name sports.,buckeyes-05926,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe documentary shows how Roy Johnson the head coach of BS high school shows that every step of the documentary that he is a complete villain who cares about no one but himself but trying to make himself famous. It feels like he trying to use the documentary to make him self famous despite he has messed up every step of the way and might be the worst football coach of all time. Roy Johnson in the interviews does nothing to help himself. You feel sorry for everyone in the documentary expect Roy Johnson not just because of the facts of the story but how he acts in the documentary. Roy Johnson every second he is one screen from start to finish feels like he is trying to make sure you hate him with every once of your soul. The documentary can show how a con man can ruin something that is as pure as high school sports. The documentary shows how one many can prey on young man dreams and ruin them for life. Its a great documentary that takes an interment joke that shows a villain and heart behind the story.,True
6,9,I don't know why everyone is hating on this,jt-nutt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Apparently only ESPN can make good documentaries according to some of you. I don't think they glorify Roy Johnson but let him reveal his true character. He's a fast talker, he's got tons of charisma, and he's full of BS. It's all about him! Apparently some people missed the stories of the kids affected by this man. The kids crying, the lives ruined. The mothers dealing with the aftermath. They paint a pretty good picture of what a horrible person Roy Johnson is. And they even say ""hey, this could have happened anywhere he just happened to be the right guy at the right time.""The story telling is fantastic. The production is fantastic. The human element of everyone even Roy is perfectly done. If you want a great story horribly produced documentary, watch ""The Perfect Bid: The Contestant Who Knew Too Much"" and learn how to not edit a film.This is a must watch in my opinion. Just like the Woodstock 99 documentaries, you're going to leave in a bad mood but it's because you should. I guess I shouldn't be surprised people on the internet hate something for stupid reasons but oh well.",False
7,5,Kind of hard to watch....,bradydaw,n/a,16/08/2025,"Roy, con-artist extraordinaire, lies, steals and manipulates his way into establishing an illegal football academy selling false hopes to vulnerable youth. The premise is enticing, but ultimately hearing directly from Roy for so much time spoils the experience. He might honestly be one of the least like-able personas on TV.You'll feel complicit watching this documentary giving Roy exactly what he's always wanted - attention. And thats the rub. I was interested to hear more about the outlandish tales, but within the context of not acknowledging Roy for being some incredible entrepreneur and hustler. Anyone who takes advantage of kids like that shouldn't be provided any sort of limelight to explain their side of the story.",False
8,8,BS High was BS film was great!!,mamato160,n/a,16/08/2025,I remember hearing the story about B. S. high when it broke a few years ago but I didn't do a deep dive on the matter or remember the details of the situation. This film does a great job of bringing to light Coach Rory and his selfish manipulative con-man antics. Coach Rory's self serving narrcisstic behavior is on full display for the world to see during this film. He has a strong personality so I can see him doing media rounds after this documentary. No one should give this man any attention after misleading and jeopardizing the safety and welfare of these kids (some were lol). You can't believe the situations an adult would bring children into for their own self-serving reasons.The film is biased into exposing B. S. high and doesn't give a platform to any good that the program or coach may have had on some of the kids. After seeing the egomaniac on full display you kind of understand why. Watch this film extremely entertaining as well as frustrating and unbelievable.,False
9,10,Field Goals and Foul Plays,natmavila,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the world where documentaries often tread the line between sobering realities and the absurd, ""BS High"" pirouettes over that line wearing clown shoes, executing a flawless landing into the realm of the utterly unbelievable. This cinematic journey into the Bishop Sycamore High School scandal is akin to watching a trainwreck in slow motion, except the train is made of lies, the tracks are made of dreams, and the conductor is none other than Roy Johnson, with a whistle that seems to only play the tunes of deception. The film masterfully strings together interviews with the former head coach, his colleagues, key journalists like Andrew King and Bomani Jones, a determined school sports investigator Ben Ferree, and the bewildered players who rode this train, providing a narrative so wild it would make fiction writers blush.Directors Martin Desmond Roe and Travon Free make the audience oscillate between uproarious laughter and jaw-dropping disbelief. Through candid interviews with Johnson, Branham, Peterson, and the players, the film peels back the layers of this onion of deceit, and yes, there are tears. The inclusion of journalists and Ferree adds a crucial layer of seriousness to the mix, providing just enough grounding to remind us that this saga, unbelievably, is not a work of fiction. Their incredulous expressions as they recount the unraveling of BS High's façade are worth the price of admission alone.But it's not just the scandal that steals the show; it's the way ""BS High"" presents it. Like a magician revealing his tricks, the documentary lays bare the mechanics of the scam with a flair for the dramatic. It's a rollercoaster that you didn't know you needed a ticket for, with twists and turns that leave you questioning the very fabric of reality. In the end, ""BS High"" is a testament to the truth being stranger than fiction, and a reminder that sometimes, reality needs no embellishment to be thoroughly entertaining. Hats off to the filmmakers for turning one of the most baffling stories in high school sports history into a five-star cinematic experience.",False
10,5,Mixed feelings,tlkoehn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would have preferred this documentary to not have the scumbag Roy in it. He tries to come off as a guy that just does what he wants, whenever he wants and laughs about it.I feel for the kids that were swindled by him. Roy belongs in jail. He even asks am I in jail? He should be. He's a pathological liar. He says he is the most honest liar he knows. That says a lot about him.I don't understand how any parent didn't check in to this at all. How can you not be interested in it your child's grades?I think the actual production of the documentary was ok. I think the execution of it was poor. They give Roy way too much camera time.",False
11,1,Do not give this guy a voice!,chrishall-52923,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI recommend NOT WATCHING THIS!If you want to know what a con looks like, fine. But everyone that watches this documentary is giving their ears and eyes to an egotistical con man! And he got away with everything because he did his research (assumed on my part from how the story is told). He got away with it and he is proud of it. He has no remorse for taking advantage of kids...just does not care.DO NOT WATCH!!! Make this documentary die on the vine...he wants his name out there (which is why it is not in this review)! His desire was to be famous, and watching this give him exactly what he wanted from the beginning.",True
12,1,Omg this is so pretentiously bad,lu_lou_belle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Partly my fault for wasting my time anymore now that serial documentaries are the 'erudite' alternative to reality programs for relatively cheap to produce streaming filler entertainment. I really can't take this glorification of a psychopath as star of the show to drive this story, it's sickening. It makes all the investigators and journalists complicit to the crime of glorifying his behavior simply by giving him a mic and a camera lens. It's not about anything else than Roy Johnson, so the title, pun included, and certainly the descriptions are deceiving. It's a cringe filled story you've heard many times before only this has been stretched from a 30-60 minute spot to a serial, a meta con with in a con with in a con. HBO is over. 30 on 30 produces much better sports documentaries. Notable quotes: ""i could tell you some stories you'd never believe, but I'd literally say whatever I need to say to pull that dog up out you."" ""One of those stoid kids, I mean one of those young men that I like...""",False
13,n/a,HBO..,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are 10 reviews but 47 votes? Don't trust the rating...... I recently saw the movie BS High, and I have to say, it left me underwhelmed. It's evident that big media is trying to portray itself as the best, even if that means over-dramatizing the leaders of a fake high school.HBO has a reputation for doing this kind of thing, and in my opinion, it's a waste of time. Although the movie had its share of exciting moments, overall, it felt like they were trying too hard to make it seem like something it wasn't.I enjoy a good drama as much as the next person, but when it's so clearly fabricated, it takes away from the real emotion and impact of the story. That's what bothered me the most about BS High - it was so obviously trying to manipulate me into feeling a certain way.Ultimately, we must remember that not everything we see on TV or in movies is real. We must be able to discern what's genuine and what's not, and not be swayed by flashy production values or big names attached to a project.At the end of the day, it's the stories that truly touch our hearts and souls that are worth our time and attention. The rest is just noise sadly...",False

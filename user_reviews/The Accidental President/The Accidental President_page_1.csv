1,6,Its a Shame Trump supporters don't see what a nightmare He is!,Ckn48,n/a,16/08/2025,"2020. Accidental. President. The.txtConsidering all of the lies and deceit around trumps election and presidency, Claims of bias are greatly exaggerated. This is balanced. It doesnt go all out to Expose trumps lies & its a shame it doesnt. It should be a warning to future generations NOT to believe a word this man says but there are a LOT of Americans willing to vote for someone who does not care for 99% of the voting electorate in America and yet upto 50% will still vote for the nightmare.The sound is ok
The Photography is okIts worth a watch üëç",False
2,2,Totally Biased Against Trump,theisaksens,n/a,16/08/2025,"It said it was supposed to show both sides, but all the ""experts"" were CNN and MSNBC pundits and Never Trumpers. There was mainly only Kelly Ann Conway standing up for Trump. It was like a Circus documentary. He was and probably always will be the best President in my lifetime that was not a ""polished politician,"" but brought us back from 50% unemployment, no longer weak in the eyes of our enemies, and got us to have manufacturing back in the USA.",False
3,1,I would put 0/10 if I could.,kassb77,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bad Documentary , very biased.President Trump was unfairly presented.",False
4,3,"Leans left, thought by title it was Harris",trimblair,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thought it would be about Harris whom nobody voted for, only 2% of dems in primaries. Unfairly painted Trump as a mistake when he was fairly voted in. Wish it would have covered his many successes. Shows Americans unhappy with Obama and with their choices of Hillary or Trump as Hillary is under investigation by the FBI. Not great.",False
5,8,this is a good documentary...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"For all of us other bystanders that cant decide nor vote because were not part of the system, like me, a grumpy old norwegian, that wasnt shocked when trump won, but more shocked that the media management still havent been able to speak clearly how he did win... therefore docus like this is made, and i just devour them because its a 3 star worthy michelin menu every time im encountering shrines like this, that fulfills my appetite on my conviction that usa is like a stew of every kinda meat and vegetables that exists on this earth , boiled in a pressure cooker, and out comes the star spangled banner of the great land of the strong and the free, and i believe 80% of americans with hand held at the heartroot that that is the truth, when the real answer ultimately shows the direct opposite.So whether youre a dem or a gop or a crook, elections like 2016 came out as a result of a societal disease, a protest like every protests, cause americans loves to protest, and sue and hope...and the weird thing is that the public never wins, they loose every battle from rounding up on a sidewalk for something, fighting union issues, a phrase that almost has ceased to exist, and the winner actually tries to overkill and dump back to communist russia. How could the grassroot of the proud people of america embrace such a candidate??? Its a simple answer, there were no real opponent.I would have loved to see the whole interviews uncut by each ''knowhower'' that were sampled to make this documentary, each and everyone of it yes, therefore whether black or white, dem. Or rep., do entertain yourself with this overanalysed phenomenon called trump once again, they called him a political alien in the beginning, and maybe he is an alien... from deep space... communicating via the antenna on top of the golden pyramide on top of the trump tower, being dictated by the dark forces of dark matter somewhere out there??? Im just joking...though i guess some will thumb me up for this idea anywaya recommend from the grumpy old man.",False
6,1,Garbage,top7172-290-730667,n/a,16/08/2025,"The premise of The Accidental President oversimplifies Trump's 2016 victory by framing it as unexpected or accidental. A closer examination reveals that his success was rooted in intentional strategy, cultural and political trends, and voter sentiment. While some factors (like media coverage) played a role, they are insufficient to fully explain the outcome. Far from being an anomaly, Trump's win reflected broader systemic dynamics that had been building for years.Trump's win fits into a global trend of populist movements and anti-establishment candidates, as seen in Brexit and the rise of leaders like Jair Bolsonaro. His election wasn't an isolated or purely American phenomenon but part of a larger wave of political realignment.",False
7,9,The State of Our Political Culture,sfmovingroovin,n/a,16/08/2025,"The pacing of this documentary moved well and kept me engaged. I thought this was well put together considering how much information they had to go thru to make this story.
I cringed each time I see #45, after all it is about him and that's a fact. I wanted to see more (believe it or not). What I want to see more of is if he did come thru and help his so called voters. I want to see interviews and what he did to help them, like bring them jobs? This is a great documentary to open or continue a dialogue that will last for centuries as #45 has changed the political culture. I agree with someone who was interviewed who said, ""We, the voters have to make a change in how debates are managed and addressed (I'm not saying this by verbatim) moving forward."" I thought the editing and transitions of this documentary worked well with the soundtrack. I like the opening and ending of it too! Bravo to everyone on a job well done.",False

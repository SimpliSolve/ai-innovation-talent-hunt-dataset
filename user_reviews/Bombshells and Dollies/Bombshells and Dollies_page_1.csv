1,9,A refreshing trip down memory lane,dmdmovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a post war baby boomer. My earliest recollection I have of a pinup girls is from ""Family Classics"" with Frazier Thomas. As a kid, me and my eight siblings would gather around the television set every Sunday for two hours. It was the only time my father would relinquish control of it. Sundays for us was like going to the movies, and ""Family Classics"" broadcast - an abundance of war films that featured pinup girls. Betty Grable, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner, Katherine Hepburn and Lauren Bacall. Later I learned more about pinup girls and the role they played during World War II for servicemen. American movie classics news reels gave them hope that soon things would return to normal in the war would be over.
Bombshells and Dollies was very refreshing to see up close and personal. This by gone era alive and well today, touching the hearts of veterans young and old, especially those who are now in the twilight years. It seemed to have somewhat of a cult-like following. Looking at the crowd, there were mostly baby boomers like myself. The cars, the Women were beautiful. I love their back stories but some of the tattoos took something away from the beauty of the women for me; I am not a big fan of tattoos. I wish there was more music. I like The Stray Cats but I'm not too big on rockabilly. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, The Oak Ridge Boys are more my speed, but I could feel the vibes everybody was feeling. People were having fun and Vegas for the festival - perfect!
The documentary was well scripted and directed. It made you feel like you were there. Kudos Danny Halperin, kudos! I'll give it 4 1/2 stars.",False
2,8,An interesting film for the #Metoo Era,david-47094,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Bombshells and Dollies"" provides an in-depth look at the world of beauty pageant culture that seems a bit anachronistic in the era of the #Metoo wokeness. For that reason alone, it is worth watching to understand the underlying attraction that draws participants from all over the globe. They invest enormous amounts of time and effort on everything from wardrobes to makeup in order to be selected as finalists for the annual competition held at the Orleans Hotel in Las Vegas. Each participant is glamorous and charming in her own way, and all are wholeheartedly dedicated to their craft. It is eye-opening to see that they find fulfillment in their roles as objects of adulation and desire by the predominantly male audience. The historical backdrop of the WWII era and the role that pinups played as a morale booster for the troops ties the past together with the present and provides context.
The intertwining of Rockabilly music and meticulously restored classic cars is another element that captures attention. '
The viewer develops an affinity for the individuals involved, and it is also rewarding to see how the women bond over the course of the week's activities and become close friends. You hate to see anyone lose.
Check it out for a nostalgic walk down memory lane.",False
3,9,Exceptionally crafted look into the Pin-up culture,mclaff9,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bombshells and Dollies is a very cool documentary that follows the twelve finalists in the Miss Viva Las Vegas 2015 competition. It gives us an understanding of the history, culture, and rockabilly music of pin-up life.The film is very well done and exceptionally crafted. We really get to know the women as real people and understand what inspires them. I was surprised to grow so fond of many of them.The filmmaker has structured the film very effectively. I didn't at all expect to become familiar with all twelve finalists, but he made it happen by weaving their introductions throughout the various parts of the film.",False
4,10,Viva Los Vegas!,ajanimurray,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bombshells and Dollies is a must see! I was totally enthralled by the storyline of the beautiful contestants as well as getting a peek into the 50's era. I love the cars, the music, and the way each pinup gave me a perspective of this new found culture in my life!
The film is beautifully mastered, and it was refreshing to learn something new that I have definitely gained an appreciation for.
This film will keep your attention! The natural beauty of the women coupled with their diverse backgrounds are the perfect combination that will have you rooting for more than one to be crowned.",False
5,9,Wonderful documentary of today's pinup culture,mp-67886,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film's title and description certainly give an idea of the content. But, the treatment was so unexpectedly beautiful, really loving. Contrary to expectations from trite and dismissive popular notions, these are real humans with the ambition more to make real contributions to society, than to ""win the crown"". The contestants are cooperative, much more than competitive. And their accomplishments are, in many cases, genuinely significant.
Just a great way to spend a too short time viewing!
Kudos!",False
6,9,A SNAPSHOT OF GLAMOUR,deuceanaquarter,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary gives the whole picture of the pin up girl culture, from historical perspective to modern day cultural adaption. The clever use of cards to arrange the movie segments allowed for the viewer to anticipate progress in covering the topic. The tip to Las Vegas culture in this was also noted.
Covering a wide and deep topic is not easy, from a writing, directing or editing perspective. This film was deft in it's touch while offering the viewer both a view from 10,000 feet as well as up close and personal. One can only hope for further documentaries from this team.",False
7,10,Positive themes and empowered women!,jrogers-80871,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really loved this film. It peeks behind the surface of the Miss Viva Las Vegas Pin-Up Contest and the people involved and elevates it to another level. The themes of empowered women and positive messages about body pride and believing in oneself make this a feel good watch. You will cheer on the contestants as you get to know them and their personal stories. But while the film tackles such subject matter, it never loses sight of fun as we see the rockabilly community unite for what must be an amazing celebration. A must watch.",False
8,10,Wonderful Look at the Pin Up Community!,mjensen15,n/a,16/08/2025,This provides a wonderful look at these amazing women who are being their truest selves! It's inspiring to see them do something they are so passionate about. It's a lovely community that is documented here!,False
9,10,"I loved ""Bombshells and Dollies""!",karen-233-163428,n/a,16/08/2025,"My husband and I both loved this Documentary. It was informative, fascinating and educational. I knew of history's Pin Up Girls but I never knew about the culture and the current Pin Up world today. Any American history or fashion buff will love this and the average American should watch it to learn more about our rich culture - both in past years and right now! And the Viva La Las Vegas competitions are incredible, including Pin Up models, antique cars and Rockabilly music. We had a great time watching!",False
10,10,This Show is a lot of GOOD FUN,tonyseller,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched with my wife. I really liked the Rockabilly soundtrack, the classic cars. My wife liked the dresses, the shoes and accessories that go into the pinup style. The hair and makeup too. There were people from all over the world at the event. In the contest there were ladies from Brazil, Australia, South Africa and maybe New Zealand? I had no idea that this subculture was so international. The movie made me think of my parents. My dad was in WWII in the Army and my mom worked in a factory making parts for airplanes. The girl my wife was rooting for won! Mine didn't but she had a great story. All the ladies stories were interesting. Liked it a lot. Watching it was a fun time and We will watch it again.",False
11,10,Interesting concept,newmandonna,n/a,16/08/2025,I found it beautifully filmed. The characters are interesting and each beautiful in there own way.,False
12,10,DREAMS of the PINUP culture!,pamela-murphy,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe previous reviews perfectly capture what this documentary film is about...the historical as well as the surprisingly current-culture of the world of pinup girls...leading up to the highly-anticipated and highly-coveted garnering of the Miss Viva Las Vegas title!In addition to the beauty of the film - the great editing - and fabulous music that sweeps you away on a fun ride - it was the emotional connection to the characters that made this film even more special. That takes a special director to connect the audience in that way!This is also a terrific film to watch (and re-watch) with a group (safely distanced ;-)! There's so much for both men and women to appreciate! And it's just good FUN!!One learns a lot about this subculture and you will not forget the film. In fact, you may want to just head to the next Miss Viva Las Vegas contest to participate in this rockabilly ride!Good Job TEAM and I will track you for your next film!",True
13,10,A Fascinating Film with Heaps of Heart,longexhale,n/a,16/08/2025,"This cool, off-beat film takes us deep into Rockabilly Culture and the Pinup Girl (dollies) contest at their annual Pow Wow in Las Vegas. Wasn't sure what to expect as I'd never even heard of this subculture, but it turned out to be quite an eye opening, entertaining ride. While the movie's main focus is on a Retro beauty contest, through interviews with GORGEOUS contestants, the film explores the changing image and roles of women before, during and after WWII. Bold, beautiful photography and a lighthearted feminist message. Fun, quirky and sweet.
Just watch it, you'll love it.",False
14,10,What a Wonderful Peek into an Incredible Culture,kyleskatz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is fascinating and filled with love and respect for the amazing, strong, hardworking women we're able to follow through a small portion of their lives.

16,9,"Uplifting, Body-positive, Unique look at the world of modern Pinup Girl competitions",danabrams999,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not what you might expect. The Pin-up Girl scene and the real women featured in this documentary are not remotely like those in traditional, cliched, catty, mean-girl beauty pageants. These sympathetic women are supportive of each other and celebrate their beauty in a panoply of forms. Start watching curious and end hopeful.",False
17,9,Body-Positive Bombshells & Dollies with Heart!,eccentric_euphemism,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a huge fan of Rockabilly and pinup culture, ""Bombshells and Dollies"" was a delightful romp through the glorious technicolor of the genre. And as a woman, I appreciated seeing a documentary that showcased the female empowerment that is an important part of the pinup community. The contests featured in the film are a positive twist on the traditional beauty pageant-all shapes and sizes of the female form are accepted and celebrated.""Bombshells and Dollies"" makes me wish I had the money to dress like a pinup every day! At least I can live vicariously through the charming ladies who tell their stories in this documentary.",False
18,10,There is still kindness from around the world,gnicholsmarvin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't even begin to tell you how much I enjoyed Bombshells and Dollies. These girls came from around the world to Las Vegas to compete in this competition, a competition that I did not even know existed.They were of all ages and shapes and all with different stories. The common thread for me was how they treated and encouraged one another. It was with complete sweetness and kindness that they pursued their dream.
This movie was sincerely touching.",False
19,9,Fun. Feminine. Fantastic.,davisonkat,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just had the delight of watching Bombshells and Dollies. Now I regret not dating that rockabilly guy I met a while back and I'm rethinking blue hair.Thank you for empowering women with a message that you can be many magnificent and accomplished things, but it's still okay to enjoy being feminine and that beautiful comes in so many varieties. Bombshells and Dollies does a wonderful job of capturing each woman's unique persona as well as their touchingly authentic backstories.",False
20,10,Entertaining and Empowering,runpunchfly,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved this documentary! Seeing the culture of Pinups & Rockabilly told through the stories of 12 contestants made me appreciate the value of rad chicks being able to do things they love, their way. The music and the fashion and the overall vibe is really so empowering and inspiring. And fun to watch!",False
21,9,Great documentary of the pinup subculture,jennabwilen,n/a,16/08/2025,"'BOMBSHELLS AND DOLLIES' is a story of female empowerment, self-confidence, personal goals, celebrating every woman's unique individuality, embracing all body types, races, sexual orientations and cultures.Truly a hidden gem -- and an uplifting film to watch, especially given our world's current pandemic.A definite must-see!",False
22,10,The Why behind Today's Pinup Culture,jsweetwood,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bombshells and Dollies gives a thoughtful look into today's International Pinup subculture. It blows away stereotypes and exposes the depth, classic femininity and strength of the Miss Viva Las Vegas contestants.",False
23,10,Swept Me Off My Feet,julie_369,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dan Halperin's doc, Bombshells and Dollies swept me off my feet, back into the '50s and welcomed me in with love and realism. This doc covers the whole scene...vintage cars and fashion, rockabilly music, old school/new school including tattoo art and of course beautiful women. It centers on the massive Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekend now in its 23rd year. The sisterhood that exists among the diverse group of contestants from all over the world for the Miss Viva Las Vegas contest, is beautifully genuine. These women are models of individual female empowerment. I enjoyed this doc so much that I can't wait to buy myself a vintage dress, listen to some Rockabilly music and DANCE.",False

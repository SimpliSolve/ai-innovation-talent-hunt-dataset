1,10,Very moving true strory.,belenus-133-722656,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a beautiful documentary. It takes you right into the heart of the darkest period in the 20th century, right into the heart of a Holocaust - Krakow in Poland, where the famous Plaszow ghetto was located and where the trains were loaded for Auschwitz. It's also a very intimate and moving portrait of a true friendship between two great artists. We get to see incredible suffering but also have a chance to witness a fantastic sense of humour, which obviously is the best way to deal with such sad memories. We can also now understand why Polanski refused to film ""The Shindler's List"" and instead filmed ""The Pianist"". We should be very grateful to film authors. PS - People who give this film a low rating obviously have not seen it.",False

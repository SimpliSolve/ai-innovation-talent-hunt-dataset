1,8,A great insight into pivotal films and how they're made,peteaclark,n/a,15/08/2025,I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. It had a dream-like quality to it. Musing on films which have changed the way we look at movies. The presentation was beautifully executed and interspersed with some thougtful imagery. It has given me a long list of films to watch and reminded me of some to rewatch. I am a little puzzled by the other reviews of this as I really enjoyed the narration.,False
2,5,"A love letter to Mark Cousins, by Mark Cousins",samnaji-15383,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is really an essay by Mark Cousins, on the films he has watched in the last 20 years and what he thinks about them. There is little in the way of actual insight. I found it useful to find new films which look interesting, films that either passed me by or I did not hear of. In that way I am grateful to be introduced to The Kidnappers, Cemetery of Splendour, Theorem, November, It Follows, Norte, An Elephant Sitting Still, About Leila and The Pearl Button.For an analysis of 21st Century films released this essay was very wanting. There was no rhyme or rhythm to the structure. Many times it was a case of Cousins saying ""look at this"", ""look at that"", ""isn't that smart"". That kind of investigation can only go so far until you realise it is just a collage of film snippets that look great.For a better analysis of film, I recommend the BritBox exclusive Reel Britannia which looks into British films by decade between the 1960s and 1990s. That is a clever concept as the stop gaps are the decade themselves and the TV show elaborately picks a subject or genre and discusses with more depth than this film.A lot of people have criticised Cousins dry delivery in his narration. Personally, I did not mind it, although it does put into mind it is not so much what he says, which is actually not that interesting, but the way he says it. Some people may confuse slow delivery with deftness. I came away with the impression this film is limited by what Cousins saw and he has not seen.It is really a love note to himself.This is a documentary that taught me next to nothing.",False
3,5,Ramblings on Film: A Disappointment,jorgen_eg,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was excited when I discovered the existence of this sequel to ""The Story of Film: An Odyssey"" at the library. Unfortunately, it comes nowhere near the greatness of the original series, as it's a thinly connected mess of little coherence. I was excited to see the last decade of cinema summed up and have lines and threads I might not have thought about before drawn up for me, but unfortunately there are few big lines to see throughout the film. Cousin's just rambles on from one thing to the next, connecting the films only by his own stream of consciousness. For the most part, he just narrates what's going on onscreen in a single scene he's decided to feature, without telling you why this film is of any interest at all. There are some parts that connect more than others, and after talking about ""The Look of Silence"" and ""The Act of Killing"", he keeps his act together for a while, before the film starts rambling again. Unlike the original series, I haven't gotten the urge to watch a lot of the films I hadn't seen before, because the film gives me too little insight into what's good about the films, or why they're important.",False
4,3,Mark Cousins is as pretentious as it gets,rabbitmoon,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's always nice seeing montages of film clips, if only to discover new treats. I watched a third of this on 1.5x speed, which made Cousins' monotonous, slow narration sound vaguely more normal. But then the clips were too fast. Cousins really is a pompous dousche. He describes the opening credits of Deadpool as if we need to be told that they're somehow edgy or different. He explains that they 'pushed the boundaries of comedy' or something. And on it goes. He seems to think he's some appointed superiority on the real poetry of cinema, here to hold your hand through stuff that never would have occured to you before. Even explaining how 'passion' drives cinema. Yet his own narration is so passionless, so pretentiously lofty in its delivery, he commits a huge sin in boring you rather than exciting you about cinema. I prefer Scorsese or Tarantino riffing on their observations anyday. Cousins should really be making hypnotherapy CDs.",False

6,1,Terrible narrator!,gofockuself,n/a,15/08/2025,"The main reason why I give this documentary the lowest 1/10 is totally resulted from the narrator's voice over the whole process; a terrible, spiritless, gloomy, energy-less, moody, old, lifeless low voice that affect the viewing to such a painful experience. Why chose this guy to narrate it is beyond my comprehension. The voice is like a dying person confessed to a priest in an ICU bed in his last breath, telling what he did wrong from his childhood to puberty teenage, to adulthood, getting old and older, became a senior, to a pathetic senile status, all his relatives were passed away, now he's on a life-support system and dying.Jesus, I've never watched anything like this, this guy's voice is like a guy who sleepwalking in a complete dark street, murmuring, blabbering gibberish his lifelong tragic memories. There's no way for me to get excited or interests to follow his voice to watch along. Adieus!",False
7,3,Ruined by the most torturous narrator's voice,Robert-Willard-Bates,n/a,15/08/2025,"The material presented in this marathon documentary is good enough, but it takes herculean effort and patience to endure narrator Cousin's astonishingly and consistently annoying manner of speaking, hour after hour.Each sentence of narration is delivered the same monotonous way: lifelessly and sleepily, with every last syllable of every sentence ending with an identical upward inflection, giving a sense of questioning uncertainty like a helpless dying whimper.A charming Irish lilt is one thing, but there is nothing charming about Cousins' style of narration. Any director with any sense at all would have chosen a different narrator to make this a far more compelling documentary.",False
8,4,Interesting but a hard watch.,Puffadder69,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an interesting documentary about modern film from around the world.There are a lot of films mentioned here that I had not heard of and are now added to my list on IMDb, so it was worth watching just to find some films you may not have discovered otherwise.However due to the narrator having the most monotone voice I have heard I had to watch this in three parts, I'm sure he knows his stuff but he sounds very uninterested in his on own project which makes it hard to concentrate.Perhaps this would have been better as a three part series rather then a 165 minute documentary to make it more digestible?",False
9,3,If narrators were hypnotists,davewenborn,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched a little while before the eyelids became heavy, it's not the content, but the monotonous drone of a voice...explains things as if he should be heard, the expert, but when the life-force is that of a deadweight glutton after a Christmas meal, the best thing you can do is switch off the film and go for a sleep. Worst narration I've heard, despite the obvious knowledge it holds. Maybe he's listened to too many voiceovers by Morgan freeman and assumed he could emulate. Freeman's voice wouldn't do it justice either. Maybe Mark Kermode could have been approached, or someone with a bit of life and doesn't need a de-esser to eliminate more hisses than the snake from disneys Robin Hood.",False
10,1,I'd advise against it.,bostockleigh-75918,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis might have been interesting if Mark Cousins had spent a little extra on the budget to pay for a real Narrator, however, he didn't and his slow, mind-numbingly boring speech grates, and grates until at 23:50 into a TWO AND A QUARTER HOUR movie, not only do you hate what you're watching, but you hate him, his accent and the fact that you're actually inflicting this pain upon yourself - all you have to do is press ""ESCAPE"" and you'll be free! This is a pity because I'm sure some of the movies he mentions here are notable. I hope he doesn't try acting. It's the sort of dull monotone that either indicates he thinks he's too clever to show emotion or he simply has no emotion. As far as the content goes, he simply describes what you're seeing on the screen. There are no secrets imparted or anecdotes regarding the techniques he's supposed to be telling us about. This has all the quality of a teenager's first high-school project.",True
11,5,Disappointing,pacocharte,n/a,15/08/2025,"Being new to Mark Cousins, I was a little thrown off by how thick his Irish accent is. It doesn't help that he kind of just meanders on in a stream of consciousness fashion while cycling through various film clips.The nominal subject of this documentary is movies from the 21st century, but he spends ample - too much really - time trying to tie things back to previous films from long ago. This adds significantly to the run time which hits 2 hours and 40 minutes.If the whole affair was more engaging, I could see it as a piece of film school curriculum or a means of motivating the young to go back and check out what's already been done - because a lot has been done that's fading from the collective memory as time goes on.Unfortunately, and I am pretty forgiving with films, especially documentaries, the combination of the above put me off to this director and his style and therefore cannot highly recommend this film.His 2011 Story of Film: An Odyssey was broken up into 15 1-hour episodes and I think a similar approach would have accomplished two things here: 1) Way more films could have been discussed and 2) Audience attention would be easier to maintain.All in all, 5 out of 10.",False
12,1,How 2 suck all the fun out of life and moviegoing,stevelivesey-37183,n/a,15/08/2025,"Mark cousins clearly knows lots about cinema and film but golly gosh he has the most boring, sleep inducing style of narration ever.I guess I just dont understand the premise. Point out the best movies made in this century. How does he do that? By showing films from the thirties, forties, etc.So this is just a list of movies that Cousins likes . As a result its self indugent and really dull.There is nothing more to be said. The only people who can like this movie are those the pretentious types, the film schoolers and those that get sniffy about Top Gun or Marvel films. The ones that actually keep cinemas open.",False
13,5,The Story of Film: A New Generation,henry8-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"An insight into how cinema across the world has changed in recent years and it's impact upon us.Those who go to the pictures at their local multiplex once a week, may wish to look elsewhere for a documentary about the movies, as this is probably not it. Cousins takes cinema very very seriously and shares with us through probably over 100 clips precisely in his view what are the clever life changing pieces of cinema that the world should be impressed by and why. Ok, it's a point of view like any criticism and he clearly knows his stuff, but overall it's a hard slog unless you're a cineaste or a film critic reliving the films you've reviewed so carefully, that probably few others watching this on Netflix will have seen. Coupled with Cousins' slow, whispering Irish drawl that could easily send you to sleep, I suggest you avoid watching this late at night and have 'Carry on Up the Khyber' on standby.",False
14,4,Interesting but watch on mute,rikaard-46030,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found this documentary interesting, BUT as others have said it's touted as "" a new generation 21 century "" but he spends far too much time relating stuff back 50-60 years ago.Also this guy's narration and style would put even a Crystal meth doper to sleep.It's a constant droll monotone with no punctuation, no gap, pause , breath nothing.I watched 30 minutes or so and turned it off.I think he was trying to be too clever or art for arts sake.Just film a documentary and get Mark Kermode to narrate ! At leader he has some enthusiasm.This was read with a style as weak as dish water . 5/5 for program
1/5 for narration and that for turning up zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz !!!",False
15,1,A poor follow up,PaulB-371,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am more than an hour in and he seems to obsessed with horror as a genre. The opening mentions comedies the on to horror. To quote Brando as Kurtz, ""the horror the horror."" The original Story of Film was brilliant, even if I didn't always agree with his analysis. This film is very self indulgent. For years I have said that Godard is the opiate of the cinephile. This film is the example of that idea. Where the pretentiousness of the visual art world infects film. The need as Godard always had, showing how cute and intellectually challenging you can be. Digging up the techniques of Brakehage, Bailee and Razutis and fitting them into feature films abd documentaries. A celebration of the esoteric dead end so much of art has become. Like the way Free Jazz created music that no one wanted to listen to but other outlier esoteric folks. Cousins has completely dropped the ball in this film. Two hours of my life wasted on Cousins trying to show how intellectually deep he is. If I wanted my time wasted I could have just watched a Godard film!",False

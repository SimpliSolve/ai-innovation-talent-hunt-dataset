1,9,Beautifully edited,img54-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tells the story of Simon's rise from boy in Queens New York, making music as a duo with his friend to rise as perhaps the greatest songwriter of our time.The direction and editing are very well done, the visuals add so much.I remember his early years with Garfunkel. The public story line was how much of a collaboration it was. In reality it was more like 99% Paul. Garfunkel's voice added an ethereal beauty to the vocals. But as I got deeper into the story I was reminded of the amazing directions Simon's music took. Not content with doing the same old thing he forged a kinship with musicians from South Africa and Brazil. He really is a musical genius.This tells the story of his latest album, a miracle in itself considering he is now completely deaf in one ear. This entire album was born from a dream.",False
2,8,Extremely moving!,rjt-86251,n/a,16/08/2025,"Paul and Alex Gibney did a beautiful job...tastefully done, showcasing different eras of Paul's incredible careerIt was awesome to see behind the scenes of Paul's process...I liked the chronological approach personallyA true portrait of a resilient, brilliant artist whose songs have moved us for years!The only thing that could have enhanced the experience is an Art Garfunkel interview but obviously that would have been tough to pull off! I'm probably asking for too much!I hope to see Paul live someday...hopefully his hearing improves and he can tour Seven Psalms. It would be a treat to seeThank you Paul for your contributions to our cultureRyan from chicago.",False
3,8,Episode 1 ending misunderstood,kvdxtshy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let me begin by saying some thought Paul said at the end of episode 1 that Garfunkel was a person he never wanted to see again. But that's not what he said. He was talking about himself never wanting to ""see"" or be that person again. Himself, being that way..I really enjoyed it. They were truly a unique duo and so talented. Still are, really. Unfortunately, and also ironically, Paul has lost most of his hearing but he's still writing songs. Reminds me of Johnny Cash at close to the end of his life, and his reflecting on his life through song.It brought back a lot of memories of troubled, but good, times in a lot of ways.",False
4,10,Long Awaited - But Worth the Wait,alex-278,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is almost faultless; its editing and concept make it one of the best documentaries I have watched. Paul's story is told and weaved within a contemporary narrative as he works on his new album, 7 Psalms. There are no talking heads, all the voice overs or narration is done with people that are introduced through archival footage and it is therefore seamless. The documentary ends with him and Edie (his wife) ,in his studio, singing a couple of verses of a song from his 7 Psalms album. This sets up a sense that he realizes that he may be reaching the end of his creative journey, and then it fades to the credits. But if you wait until just after the credits roll on episode 2, you are treated to a haunting version of Sound of Silence, recorded during a rehearsal. It is night, and he is singing to an empty hall, and in the distance people are walking along the footpath and just casually gazing towards the sound as they walk past. It is a slow and very moving and neatly provides a bookend to an amazing career as it was this song that launched his career all those years ago. The versions are worlds apart; his youthful version launched his career was a driving folk rock version with twanging guitars and drums, this version, matured and just reflecting where he is now.I am a huge fan of Paul's and he has been part of my life since almost the beginning. I learnt to play the guitar by emulating his style and have memories of spending many, many hours trying to master songs like Kathy's Song, and this documentary is an is an absolute enjoyment from start to finish and tops everything off.",False
5,10,A PORTRAIT OF ONE OF THE GREATS...!,masonfisk,n/a,16/08/2025,"A 2023 comprehensive & some might say exhaustive documentary (running 3 & 1/2 hours) on the musical career of one Paul Simon. Tracing his roots from Queens & his hit or miss early days in the industry, things started to click when he hooked up w/an old school chum, Art Garfunkel (heard via audio interviewers), who provided the perfect vocal accompaniment to his songwriting (something he remarks over & over again, he wrote all the songs). Soon enough, especially after the Graduate came out, the pair became the duo par excellence for the age but as the 70's encroached & Simon soon ventured into acting (appearing in Annie Hall) w/many appearances on Saturday Night Live (he became close friends w/producer Lorne Michaels so much so Michaels was his best man when he married Carrie Fisher) but after his 1st marriage dissolved & his one foray into starring (& co-writing) in a film named One Trick Pony failed to find an audience, he was in the doldrums which finally broke when he released his world music tinged Graceland in the 80's which proved to be immensely popular along w/his vaulted reunion w/Garfunkel for a free concert in Central Park, he managed to conquer the world again. W/his song lyrics & on camera musings sprinkled in w/his visual history, filmmaker Alex Gibney (Taxi to the Dark Side/Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room) follows Simon around his Texan studios which is occasionally frequented by his wife & fellow singer Edie Brickell as he talks out his process & we get an insight into this consummate songwriter & performer.",False
6,6,Appallingly insensitive conclusion of first episode,kinolieber,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great history of the first years of his and Garfunkel's lives and careers. Those albums and performances are in the pantheon of 60's musical creations. Way too much footage, though, of him noodling his new album. And isn't the guitar lick he channeled in a dream the same one from Anji 60 years ago?But the episode ends with a completely unnecessary and cruel remark about his ex partner: After saying his five year friendship with him was his first great friendship with someone who got him, he then says Garfunkel is now someone he never wants to see again. At this point in their lives, was it really necessary to make such a cruel public rejection? I'm sure he had the clout to remove that even if it wasn't his choice to include it.",False
7,n/a,Poignant Moments and Great Editing,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The outstanding songs of Simon included in this film are beyond entertaining... they express soulful themes. Director Alex Gibney made a wise choice in structuring this film. Thankfully, there are no talking heads which so many music docs depend on. The conversations mostly flow from Paul Simon, during studio sessions and various concerts.The scene about Simon's brief marriage to Carrie Fisher focused more on photographs of them. I felt that all three of his wives got the short shrift. While it's clear that Simon adores his wife Edie, and they've shared a long, successful partnership, she could have been highlighted more.The film makes several references to the struggles between Simon and Garfunkel, and why Paul decided to forge his own path. He makes a few biting comments which could be misconstrued, but maybe at this point Simon is not too concerned about what fans and critics might say.As good as this film is, there was a missed opportunity in Part 2 regarding the brilliant musicians, vocalists, and dancers from South Africa, Jamaica, and Brazil. These gifted people were essential contributors in expanding Simon's repertoire. They are shown on old footage, but most are not acknowledged by name. The film could have remedied this by using screen text, to give them their due credit. Also wonderful are the vocalists from VOCES8, who recently worked with Simon.",False
8,8,Mike Nichols broke up Simon and Garfunkel.,guam-73942,n/a,16/08/2025,"The historical overview of Simon and Garfunkel and their breakup is excellent. Less excellent is Paul Simon in his homemade Texas studio putting together his latest solo album.So lets's talk about the Simon and Garfunkel history, then, where we learn some very insightful things. Paul Simon is an excellent songwriter and his songwriting during the 1960's was beautiful, mesmerizing and groundbreaking. It spoke to the generation that grew up in the NYC metropolitan area and were impacted by the major events of the 1960's including assassinations and an extremely unpopular war. For the most part this generation was Liberal, open minded socially, politically, musically. Anti-war, anti-racism, pro-women's rights, pro-culture in general. These were Simon and Garfunkel's people and they are the one's who showed up for the Simon and Garfunkel reunion in Central Park in 1981 in an extremely emotional outpouring of love. A love of a by gone time of open mindedness and culture that Simon and Garfunkel represent.Simon's songwriting spoke to this cultured generation but he had vital help - the beautiful, angelic voice of Art Garfunkel which transformed Simon's songs from very good to the stratosphere of angelic beauty. And why these albums are all classics.Simon needed Garfunkel and they never should have split up. What they created together was not just good songs but something far more - great art!Why the split? It wasn't either musician it was a comic turned movie maker, Mike Nichols, who pushed Garfunkel into acting. A horribly bad, selfish move by Nichols who knew full well it would break up the pair. An unconscionable act of sabotage that destroyed great art. I can't watch any of Nichols movies because of this.",False
9,6,Incomplete but joyful,LeMichiel,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great documentary and it gives a very nice insight on the way Paul Simon shapes his latest (last?) album. Along the way we see the story how Simon's career started with it's ups and downs. It is a great miss the film maker stops around the succes of Graceland (okay, we got a few minutes on the follow up album ""Rhythm of th Saints"" in the movie as well.This film is missing out on the second half of Paul's career. The description of the movies mentions the six decades Paul Simon's career is spanning. Too bad the great works from the last 3 decades are not
mentioned or talked about.This makes that this film feels like incomplete. There is life after Graceland! Very much so. Too bad this was not included.Basically this film is about ""7 Psalms"", Simon & Garfunkel and Graceland. Highlights in Paul Simon's career, but not doing right to the career itself.Still a joy to watch and listen to!",False
10,8,Harmony and Discord,jimbarnard-22093,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's long, I stopped and came back 3 times to finish it. But this is worth your time. If you like harmony? Check. If you are curious about drama and breakups (discord)? Check.There were some reviewers that gave this documentary demerits for too much footage on the current ""Seven Palsms"" project. I disagree. I thought the themes and chior harmonies were fantastic and moving. I enjoy watching a work in progress! The artistic journey of following inspiration and the mystery of it all.Adgjl adhkl adhkl afhkl afhkl adghk adgjl adgjl afhkl adhkl adhkl adhkl afhjl afhkl adhkl agjl afhkl afhkl as.",False
11,7,the bar is just too high,wpirotte,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let me begin by confessing that Simon was a source of tremendous comfort during my adolescence, my primary guitar teacher, me being a self taught guitarist, and the single most direct influence on my own musical creations. I can do a few things on the guitar because of learning by ear (no tabs, no internet) that few guitarists can do. And the backdrop to all of this was what I believed to be a strongly human ethic as evidenced in at least a few of his songs. Alas, the fire disappeared over the years. No one writes anything like the protest songs of old. Remember that Scarborough Fair had an antiwar counter melody? I will refrain from reciting the obvious reasons for this. However, there is still a weird thing that is bugging me. The transformation of Sounds of Silence from a folky niche piece to a gigantic hit is covered in this documentary, and it is covered wrong. Simon did not know they were doing it, he sure as heck did not give anyone permission, and the entire coverage discounts the massive luck or divine destiny which he was blessed with. There are also bizarre issues regarding Simon's recognition of the inspiration for the Seven Psalms, but, hey, we all get old. Why am I being so hard on Paul?To whom much is given, much is expected.",False
12,3,Small Man. Bad Current Voice. Big Ego,canterburybella-680,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary didn't make Simon look like a very nice person. He treats Art like he was nothing but a baggage clerk. He obviously told a one sided story to all his wives about this as shown in the film, and without a fair recounting of events from Art, the wives made their minds up that Paul is a saint and that everything was Art's fault. Well, not so fast. Art's perfect angelic voice was a huge factor in this duo's success, a fact that probably irritates Paul Simon, as does the idea that he is less of a draw without Garfunkel. There seems to be a lot of resentment there but that doesn't justify this documentary's attempt to undermine Art's enormous contribution at every turn, and paint him out of the picture whenever possible. I'm assuming the director was under strict orders from Paul to downplay Art's role.The film goes into detail about his marriage to Carrie Fisher, yet doesn't mention his son, Harper at all , and barely mentions Harper's mother, Peggy, Simon's first wife, presumably because she wasn't famous. If you're going to bring spouses into the mix, then give them an equal share. As well, if spouses are going to be mentioned, why not mention the other 3 kids as well he had with Edie Brickell?As far as the album Simon is attempting to work on during the filming, if the intent of this documentary was to portray the great genius of Paul Simon, then they picked the worst possible album with which to do so. If someone saw this documentary without knowing Simon's early history of the 1960s and early 70s, they'd likely be baffled as to what all the fuss was about. This was a missed opportunity to make a great retrospective documentary of Simon and Garfunkel, but it's clear that Paul Simon is too small of a man to let that happen. Like McCartney, Simon has no gauge as to how poorly his current music and vocals are. Let Harper sing next time if there is a next time.",False
13,1,Neurotic new York at its finest,belindapaterson,n/a,16/08/2025,"So another moment Paul told his mother said arthur Garfunkel was a better singer ?? I should have left. Actually half the audience did at intermission. Overblown, poorly edited, a long Jewish farewell , complaining att the way...oh Artie is better than me. At least Artie had the simple grace to bow out when he did.I've been told my review isn't long enough.So on I will go. Where do I start. He msy as included footage of his much maligned bounce appearing from his mother's meeow and kept going from there and back again because there was too much back and forth which really dragged the movie down. If thst was tackled the movie running time would have been teo housr tops not 4.I left and I bet it's still playing now 3 days after it started.",False

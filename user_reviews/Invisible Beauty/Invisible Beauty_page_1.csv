1,8,Riveting!,MikeyB1793,n/a,16/08/2025,I am not one to be very interested in the fashion industry - but this was a wonderful biography of. Bethann Hardison.She is a remarkable woman who was an activist and trailblazer. She made the fashion industry recognize and utilize the talents of Black people (mostly women). This documentary really captures very well her vitality and resilience. She overcame so many obstacles.The film points out so well that she had to persist in pursuing her cause of putting Black women into the forefront of the fashion industry. There were times during when it would regress back to an all-white viewing industry.I found her portrayal in this biographical documentary captured Bethann Hardisons' energy. I knew nothing of her prior to watching this film - but now get a feel of this phenomenal human being. What a life she lived!,False
2,10,Not to be missed!,moorejacob-06441,n/a,16/08/2025,"I learned so much about the history and present of the fashion industry by watching this film. I can't recommend it enough! Bethann Hardison has so many incredible stories to tell, and the number of legendary figures she has had an influence on - all of whom make an appearance! - is staggering. Hardison and Tcheng have done a wonderful job weaving many different accounts over many decades into a clear and inspiring story. The film is both anchored in history and resolutely of the present, geared toward a richer understanding of how such entrenched challenges were met in the past, and how they must continue to be met in the future - with tenacity, grace, and beauty!",False
3,9,Interesting ...and sad,doitafraid,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI love documentaries, particularly when the subject is still alive and able to talk to the interviewer, to the camera, to us. I knew who Bethann Hardison was but didn't know about her activism in the modeling/fashion world and how groundbreaking it was, and remains. And I am a huge fan of Kadeem Hardison because I was a huge fan of A Different World...but had no idea they were related. And here comes the sad part: the fact that she never told him she was proud of his being one of the leads in a *groundbreaking* TV show; that she seemed pleased and happy about his buying her a car but I never heard the words ""thank you"" to him during that scene....that she seems cavalier about the fact that she didn't/doesn't seem to know how to love her son, nor to tell the men she knew romantically that she cared for them. She's busy, busy, and surrounded by people, yet she seems lonely because she gives it all to the CAUSE..she gives her time and energy, but not really herself. No wonder her son doesn't feel connected. It made me sad.",True
4,10,Fantastic,dknox-40862,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBethann Hardison is an attribute to black people. She epitomizes beauty, class and intelligence.I enjoyed this movie so much that I went to the theater to see it twice.I had never heard of Bethann Hardison until now. Kadeem Hardison I knew of due to the television show a ""Different World""He is an excellent artist as well. Of course I would have never known about his upbringing had his mother not consented to do this movieBravo to Ms. Hardison and all of the people who contributed to this masterpiece.I'm waiting in great anticipation for her memoir to come out. I am quite sure it will be a page turner.",True

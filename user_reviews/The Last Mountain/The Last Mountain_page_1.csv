1,8,Tragic but a good deterrent for people who let mountain madness cloud their judgement,navtaz,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe story is made compelling by the mother/son aspect who shared the same fate, and this gives it a nice soft touch, padding the documentary to be able to make the cruel reality of mountain madness and irrational behaviours that led to their deaths more relatable for people who have never been on a mountain...
For mountaineers to attempt above their competence level on a route that has had 0% success and a 100% fatality rate is exactly what Messner said.. is suicidal.. the outcome was as predicted.. it's not a story of mother and son though they this does evoke sentiments for the families loss.. but in reality the documentary is a cautionary tale about clouded judgment, climbing above your competence and choosing wreckless partners..",True
2,10,Touching and sad but yet beautiful,hanvikare,n/a,15/08/2025,Touching and sad but yet beautiful story about a family living their dream that turns to a night mare. Nice photographs and usage of old pictures from the family album. The movie makes you want to go there and at the same time also show you that you shouldn't. This is not invented. You can feel the true sadness of a sister left in the world without her dearest mother and close brother.I wish more documentaries would be like this film meaning to be able to express the feelings of the ones left behind.Many many plus signs for this excellent documentary. Photograph and music receive an extra plus.,False
3,9,Cried like a baby because of my own memories....,ronan73,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was so so beautiful. Touching and extremely sad .It evoked very happy and sad memories of my own mountaineer father..not an 8k climber but in the extreme none the less.The way the familys story shown and laid out is tremendous and keeps you holding on until the very bitter sweet end. There were a couple of points where tears flooded down my face but one particular moment is where the dad is asked a question he doesnt answer and it made me cry like a baby. You will know when you see it.You dont have to come from a mountaineering family to understand loss. The mountains just add another element.But I connected on all levels and I could feel the pain in my chest when hearing the heart breaking stories from survivors. But unlike a lot of ""survivor stories"" there is tonnes of video footage leading up to the moments we all dread.Beautiful and sad is all I can say. Its a solid 9 stars.",False
4,9,"Extraordinary story of courage, love and respect.",tanzeelkhan19-527-64748,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is not just about mountain climbing but about the obsession of achieving something that can be so devastating. One stupid wrong call can end everything when it comes mountain climbing specially when you climbing the deadly ""killer"" Nanga Parbat in Pakistan. It is an emotional story of love and respect, it tells us how we humans are so connected even if we do not understand each othes or live thousands of miles away.",False

1,7,Well made doc,Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was pleasantly surprised that the focus of this documentary lied heavily with investigators and victims rather than the murderer himself. The storyline flowed easily, the interviews were relevant, and good use of archival footage. The paired re-enactment footage was complimentary. Overall a well made documentary.",False
2,6,"Not as engrossing as I'd have liked, but still worth a watch! [+57%]",arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix has been doing a pretty solid job at serial-killer documentaries and this one falls under the 'fairly okay' category. The core story of Dennis Nilsen's crimes is interesting with some unpredictable layers, however, the recalling style lacks a finite flow. The deeper you get into Nilsen's life journey, the less engrossing it gets. What intrigues is the manner in which he's caught, the articulate person that he is on the tapes, and also some of the survivors' accounts. The homosexual angle is given somewhat less footing here but it's also carefully and respectfully put across. I would have also loved to see more interviews with people who worked alongside Nilsen to get a better insight of how he was publicly perceived. It may also have shed additional light on how he was able to keep his cover for such a long time. At 1h 24m, this one's relatively short and crisp. What astonishes me is that we still don't know the identities of half of his victims.",False
3,7,2 Tier societies,chrislawuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Could draw a parallel to Nick Broomfield's Tales From The Grim Sleeper, from the perspective that the bodies were allowed to accumulate because the target victims were from a marginalised group within society. In the former, the victims having been prostitutes, and in the latter being young gay men in 1980s Britain. You tend to think of policing as based on science and with the highest levels of professionalism applied, however this is pretty far from the truth. Both biases and discrimination playing a major role in outcomes. Maybe the biggest divide of them all is class inequality and how that affects victims and perpetrators. Its fairly well made but I felt it could have been longer and gone more in depth in to the psychology of Nilsen. More often than not documentaries tend to avoid doing this, as I guess looking deep in to the mind of a mass murderer isn't essentially positive for the greater public good. There seems to be a lot of audio and writing from him though, and i did feel in the end that aspect of the doc was cut short in this instance, as he seemed to have an awful lot to say for a serial killer.",False
4,7,The perspective of a Necrophiliac,yelizzz,n/a,16/08/2025,A well made documentary from Netflix. The pleasant narrative of the documentary and hearing the stories from different people absolutely makes it more interesting and memorable. Worth your time!,False
5,n/a,"We get it Netflix, you love tape recorders and recently deceased serial murderers.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is just the next in an endless line of same-looking Netflix ""documentaries"". At this point it has become quite clich√©: Put your guests into a dimly lit room, set the camera off at an angle and let them make vague, ominous statements. Intersplice it with footage from the 70's but with added digital grain and shaking. Use the same music as you've used in all other murder documentaries made by RAW. Lots and lots of macro shots of paper, newspapers, typewriters and of course the star of the show: the cassette player! Oh how Netflix loves to show us the tape spinning in a record player.Netflix really needs to decide if they want to produce a documentary or a mystery movie.",True
6,7,Better than the rating says,Lokroep,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you like serial killer docu's go watch it. It has a different more original approach than most and is told for a big part by the killer himself. I really liked this approach, the killer has very relaxed way of talking. Would give it between 7 and 8. Wished it was a bit longer.",False
7,7,Seen it,alanlindsay-93076,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'd like to start this review by apologizing to the writer and director of this documentary. When Netflix first came onto the scene this would have been a jaw dropping, white knuckling thrill ride. Sadly. We've seen it. We've seen it all. I give a 7/10 because it not the writer or directors fault. It's a well put together 1 hour and 30 minute murderer bio. But it's clear Netflix has a template for these now. Again, it's not a bad film just played out. You wouldn't run across the street screaming if Alice Cooper was walking towards you in the sidewalk. But 25 years ago you might of.",False
8,6,Superficial doc,Leofwine_draca,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMEMORIES OF A MURDERER is the latest in Netflix's true crime documentaries series, although sadly this is a one-off production and not nearly as in-depth as I was hoping. It's solid enough on a superficial level and starts off strongly too, with the addition of the serial killer's own voice recordings adding to the intrigue. But then it just gets bogged down with too much biographical family information on the many victims and too much talking head footage from peripheral characters who they don't seem able to get rid of - the same was true of their cat documentary. You don't get the kind of psychological depth that I was hoping for; I thoroughly recommend the book KILLING FOR COMPANY for a more thorough assessment of this man's crimes.",True
9,7,An interesting documentary.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very revealing, well made and interesting documentary about one of Britain's worst ever killers, Nilsen. It's so unusual, it's crazy to think that much of what's being said is from the voice of the man himself, it's chilling.It's well made, and well put together, fortunately it's a little less heavily produced than some of the documentaries on Netflix, it flows pretty well.I was keen to learn more about him, particularly after the David Tennant series, and this does the job, it's very interesting.A good watch, 7/10.",False
10,7,"Good watch, but wow...",alcof89,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a tough watch at times due to the nature, but it's really well done. Good watch and done in a unique way from all perspectives...",False
11,4,Incredibly boring,djslump,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first time I watched it I fell asleep, the second time I fell asleep too. Incredibly boring, it could have been squeezed in 20 minutes with better results.",False
12,8,Great,mikeiskorn,n/a,16/08/2025,A wonderfully well made documentary! I especially like the fact they had real news footage AS WELL AS real tape interviews and survivors. I've never heard of this case (like a lot actually) but I'd recommend this one to anyone interested in true crime.,False
13,7,fairly well done,mangafish,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel the movie is fairly okay done. The film used his own tape, some interviews of the police man, and news media regarding this case.As the previous user mentioned, I feel it would be nice to include more information of Dennis Nilsen by interviewing his colleague and etc. There seems to be many question left unanswered.",False
14,4,Its quite boring,iruon_itauol,n/a,16/08/2025,For a story with do much gruesomeness going on this DOC is pretty boring. Learned nothing new and where not much details on the murders.,False
15,7,Good one,ariqakbar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well i'm not really have so much parameter in term of documentary movie. The first that will catch my attention is whether it was boring or not.This one have good information story telling, good phase, intersting, but thats it. It was a good documentary movie, but nothing really came out to the surface.",False
16,6,Creepy true crime!,bizimcansu,n/a,16/08/2025,"Serial killer Nilsen talks about his crimes with audio recording from prison and how he got away with it for 5 years. He admits, the layers are removed, they put the victim pieces together like a puzzle, the underlying causes come out. Terrible. He narrates the documentary calmly, simultaneously with the victims and the detectives. What's interesting and creepy is that he doesn't know about his victims. It's beautifully constructed. The Nilsen Tapes. That's a bad story.I have watched better true crime documentaries on Netflix but it is also cool on its own way. I like the style of storytelling.",False
17,6,TDk cassettes,baber411,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI remembered watching a documentary about this man long time ago may be on discovery channel, only thing I remembered was the guy works in the job centre. While I was watching this documentary I found myself on Amazon looking for a tape recorder cassette player.",True
18,7,Worth the look,wisewebwoman,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA very revealing, well made and interesting documentary about one of Britain's worst ever killers, Nilsen. It's so unusual in that much of what's being said is from the voice of the man himself, it's chilling.Good on Netflix for not dragging this documentary out to breaking point. It's remarkably well constructed, short and concise and hammers home the points from all involved, the press, the police the surviving victims and Nilsin himself via the mutliple tapes he recorded.Like many serial killers, Nilsin targeted a marginalized group: ""rent boys"" in the eighties in London. Sadly among the at least 17 boys he strangled to death only eight have been identified. These poor displaced boys and men were never missed by families. Such shame attached to who they were in that discriminatory era.7/10.",True
19,2,A true masterpiece in boring,omri-74995,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA man kills over a dozen people, confesses to it in a series of tapes, police finds out somewhat by accident, he is probably a psychopath, they try to find the victims. There, I saved you 1.5 hours of the most boring true crime film on Netflix. Terrible watch.",True
20,9,Beautifully made,rollyhayhay,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't understand the poor reviews. I really enjoyed it, if you are a fan of serial killer things you'll enjoy that it's done in a quite unique way. It had a great insight into the murderer and his victims. Especially because of the audio recordings. Beautifully shot in a way that took to back to the bleak early 80's London era. Unless they still live in houses furnished like that still, a lot of work has gone into it that's usually missing in documentaries. It's usually very hard to fill the time with compelling footage when there is none available,I especially liked that it was something I didn't even know happened. Very clever and thorough.",False
21,5,Meh...,silviaavram-25067,n/a,16/08/2025,"A single word could describe this ""documentary"" : CHAOS! The storyline was chaotic and if someone doesn't know Nielsen's story already, they wouldn't understand a thing. How about some backstory on the murderer? Motifs? The whole investigation in detail? Some chronological order of the facts? What happened after the trial? How he decided to record himself? Etc etc...
The only good thing about this documentary are the tapes. Insted of making 1h30 bad show with a lot of missing information why not taking it slower and make it a series? Considering they had hours long of recorded tapes, they could have made a really cool show with multiple episodes where Nielsen is the narrator and we see the story from his side.",False
22,5,Mediocre,Movi3DO,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another crime documentary on Netflix, and this one depended on its unique premise of having the killer's tapes to make it special.This was quite a boring story with nothing that I have seen before. The murder was just another lesser Criminal Mind episode. Honestly, there was potential with the tapes because Nilsen's voice was calm but eerie at the same time. However, only half or less than that of the movie was his dialogues. Instead, there were more of the typical Netflix documentary style with the slow and indirect narrations from the interviewees. This works at first, but becomes monotonous and boring quickly.There one or two long monologues from Nilsen, and I think those were the most effective ones at keeping audiences on the edge. I wished the documentary would rely way more on his tapes.Overall, nothing really special from other Netflix crime documentaries. 5.5/10.",False
23,8,Grueling,btreakle,n/a,16/08/2025,This Documentary told the story from the perspective of the victims and detectives point of view. Pretty good detail.,False
24,1,Headline for my review here,supermalwina,n/a,16/08/2025,"Boring as hell. God knows what the angle the producers wanted to tak. Seems they think UK (and I don't live in UK, nor I am originally from UK) is still stuck in the 80s. Don't waste your time watching this. Nowhere near the bundy tapes. Another netflix crap floating around just because it's netflix. Very, very poor quality.",False
25,1,Absolutely avoid if you want to learn the actual facts,satansjumpmonkey-09438,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is miss classified as a documentary when it's more of a fictional retelling.It cut out the real DCI who investigated, interviewed, arrested and testified against Nielson, DCI Peter Jay.It also cut out the Biographer Nielson hired during the investigated who provided the police with key documents.Along with omitting facts about his police and army history.As quoted by the director ""...we're trying to tell a different story here. And that story had been told and has been told many times.""Ludicrous statement for what is supposed to be a documentary on facts!",False

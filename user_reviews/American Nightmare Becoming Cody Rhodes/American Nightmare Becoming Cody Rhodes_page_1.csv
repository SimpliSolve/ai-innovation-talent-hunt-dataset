1,9,AMERICAN DREAM LIVES ON,rampdedlizer,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is beautiful, emotional, and powerful. The story of American Nightmare is etched without any stutters and is a testament to documentary making. At no point does the doc becoming over bearing or cheesy. The emotions hit the right spot. Let's get into the more nerdy aspects of the doc:
a) The production is oustanding, which is unsurprising as WWE really likes to advertise their shows with utmost glamor( and rightfully so), with regards to set designs ( the desert seq in the opening).B) For a guy who isn't well versed with wrestling history, I learnt a lot from it.C) Every superstar who was present in this doc. Made it much more enjoyable
d) Cody is a lovely guy. Listening him talk about his father and his history with wrestling will never not be fun to watch.It's a fun watch. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys WWE.",False

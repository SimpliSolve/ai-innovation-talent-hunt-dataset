1,6,"Unfocused take on one of the great ""could have beens""",tributarystu,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a fan of Resident Evil, zombies and Romero, this documentary took me by surprise. I didn't know of its making, so faced with the news it had just been released piqued my curiosity. It proves to be moderately interesting, but diluted by uninspired structure and is ultimately unsure as to what it really is about.Just to prove my Resident Evil chops, I was well aware of the near mythological tales of what-could-have-been Romero's Resident Evil and even read his script for it back in the day. I'm also in the camp of those who think Paul W. S. Anderson's take on the franchise is an abomination that should never have had any tangent to the Resident Evil universe. This means that I've often ruefully wondered about why Romero wasn't allowed to bring his considerably more faithful version to life.Brandon Salisbury's take on the matter is a scattered one, diluted with narration and script read outs, but not without moments of charm and intrigue. It definitely tells a story, covering a lot of ground on both the RE franchise and Romero's legacy. After briefly introducing Romero as a creator, it goes on to the origin of the Resident Evil series. For about twenty minutes it then delves into what I thought the main topic would be about, how Romero's Resident Evil came to (not) be, before becoming a full-on ode to Romero himself.The homage to Romero is the best part of the film and, to its merit, it does also answer the question of why his version of Resident Evil didn't come about.Part of the reason why the tribute works best, is because of the colour brought by many of the people who were interviewed, obviously touched by Romero not only as an artist, but also as a person. This works well, even if there's very little from Romero himself in this film. It also delves into some interesting curiosities about the latter part of his career and his legacy, which leaves the distinct feeling that a movie focused on Romero would have had more to say.Like the Resident Evil franchise, this documentary is torn between finding a commercial niche and telling something worth watching and listening to. It's going to be kind of interesting for fans of Resident Evil, but anyone who cares about this particular intersection of history, will probably know most of the things GA Romero's Resident Evil has to say.",False
2,6,A foray into something that could have been great...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Of course I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch this 2025 documentary. And this was actually the first time I heard about how close we had legendary zombie film maker George A. Romero directing a movie adaptation of Capcom's major hit ""Resident Evil"".Sure, having had Romero put his unique touch on the ""Resident Evil"" franchise in a movie was a match made in heaven. And it is definitely something I would have enjoyed watching, no doubt about that. Not that I don't enjoy the 2012 movie ""Resident Evil"" from writer and director Paul W. S. Anderson, and let's be honest, it was a steep downhill slide with each movie released in that series of movies from Paul W. S. Anderson, but the first movie was a nice enough action movie and loose adaptation of Capcom's game series. Would Romero's movie have fared better? Well, we never get to know, but this 2025 documentary does shed some light on a lot of what-could-have-been and what-ifs.While this 2025 documentary is watchable, it tends to become a bit tedious and beating around the bush. There were certainly times throughout the 110 minutes that I was thinking 'sure, let's just move along to the next topic already'.Is it a documentary that warrants more than a single viewing? No. But it did leave me with some interesting bits of information about how Romero came to write a script for ""Resident Evil"" which unfortunately was scrapped. And yeah, I would certainly have enjoyed watching Romero tackle the ""Resident Evil"" game and bring the essence of the iconic horror game to the big screen in a way that merged his traditional zombie movie making with the aestetics of the ""Resident Evil"" games.Granted, I didn't know the man himself, heck I never even met him, but he most certainly had a profound influence on my love of all things horror and especially all things zombie. So yeah, it was nice to see his legacy being honored and have this piece of cinematic history opened up and shared widely with the world at large.My rating of director Brandon Salisbury's 2025 documentary ""George A. Romero's Resident Evil"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",False
3,7,"It's no Jodorowsky's Dune, but it's cool",inaurabass,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first half of this documentary is mostly setup for the main subject. You get an overview of Romero's career, an overview of the creation of Biohazard/ Resident Evil, and then a segment on where the two intersect with the Biohazard commercial that Romero directed. This half is fine, has some interesting tidbits, but it is long (nearly an hour) and has some tedium as well. It's a little ""in 1968 George Romero made Night of the Living Dead, and then he did ___, and then he made ____, and then he went on to make ____. In the 1990's Capcom did ____, and then they did ____."" I'm oversimplifying but outside of some interview clips and visuals to go along with the info that's the short of it. The best part was the section on the Biohazard 2 commercial, it had interesting bits on Brad Renfro's contract stipulations and I do think it accomplished showing the viewer how Romero's involvement evolved into Romero working on an RE film proper. It wasn't the most surefooted journey but it got us there.The second half focused on Romero's scripts and ended with a tribute of sorts to the man. The doc really picked up speed here, maybe a little too much speed. There's someone briskly reading through the main beats of Romero's RE scripts and, while fascinating, it comes at you fast enough to make what you're hearing/reading hard to process and appreciate. I'll have to rewatch this part. I feel like there's a missed opportunity here as well. Throughout the doc you're treated with some pretty decent reenactment type of footage that was shot at a mansion that looks pretty close to the Spencer mansion. There's actors resembling STARS characters and some Zombie makeup as well. When Romero's script is being read off, it would have enhanced the viewing experience greatly to get some representations of what you're hearing other than game footage. Even just one or two moments from the script given a little more time and examination would've deepened the experience greatly.Overall, I think this is worth checking out if you're a fan of both Romero and the classic RE games. If you're not invested in both of those things, I don't think this documentary has enough generally interesting stories or information to carry you through for 1hr 50min. I've read reviews saying that most of what this doc says is already out there in the public, that doesn't bother me though. This is a very niche subject and there is no way that this is common knowledge for casual fans so it's nice to have it all compiled and given a narrative. It has a cool presentation, and if it is a little tedious or rushed at times I think it basically accomplished what was promised. The director clearly cares about the subject which comes across well enough. I'll give it a 7.",False
4,3,"Largely fiction, misrepresenting a great director, and the realities of the film industry",BountyOfVoles,n/a,15/08/2025,"This overreaching documentary is clearly a passion project for an ill equipped director, who mistakenly makes a great deal of a mundane, standard industry tale.A company may reach out to several third parties, talk about a license being obtained, where third parties will iterate on the idea over a set period of time, and then the production ceases to move forward for one of a thousand potential reasons. It happens hundreds and thousands of times. It is not a conspiracy or a tragedy. It is not Roger Ebert and Rex Reed slandering Warren Beatty or Faye Dunaway in public media spaces at the request of various executives for several decades.A standard process is all there is to the story, and no amount of irrelevant talking heads should convince you otherwise. Well, if you're media literate.If you are media literate, you'll already be aware of the value of Romero's work outside of this incredibly small part of his five decade movie career. Resident Evil matters zilch to Romero or his legacy.George A Romero remains an incredibly important figure in both independent films and horror films. What he did with his budgets, approach, and societal critiques are indellible and inspirational, with NIght of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead remaining incredible achievements that are still spoken of by the majority of critics, fans, and creatives.On top of the problems with the concept, the director isn't particularly well equipped to put together an adequate puff piece. Fair play, they have tried to add enough fluffy somewhat flaky presentation (I may have been baking a few minutes ago) to fill out the run time, but this isn't exactly Jodorowsky's Dune. Plus, even that better but also lacking documentary overstates the potential impact of a film which was never made, and only matters to a particularly niche section of a group of obsessives. And I'll restate that I don't need a barrage of irritating talking heads who have no formal links to Romero, Constantin Films, Capcom, talking broad stroke vagueries.The worst of it all can be found in the break down of the draft against reenacted scenes from the video game. It is very much a first year video essay at college effort. The script is so plain in its references that it's clear as day as is. The visual side of the film is derivative of numerous documentary TV shows, with the reenactments reminiscent of the TV pro-wrestling pseudo-documentary series Dark Side of the Ring.Neither Romero's script, nor Resident Evil, are a bastion for subtlety or depths of meaningful layers. The project was never going to be in the spirit of Romero's Dead films, which actually do a great deal regarding class, racism, capitalism, and more.Romero's last version of the Resident Evil script is true to Resident Evil, and Resident Evil isn't nuanced or complicated. If it was, ""4 itchy Tasty"" and a closet door opening might be a comment on the bonds between cannibalism and repressed sexuality. But it's not. It's someone eating someone as a raw snack and then hiding in a cupboard.To put it plainer, Romero's advertisement for the Japanese release of Resident Evil 2 speaks to what Resident Evil was to him, and that actually got made! He didn't focus on the anti-corporation & anti-corruption angle of the notes of Resident Evil. His Resi efforts focused on a Fulci like admiration for the creatures and blood.As a positive note, the massively available Romero script is fun pulp for fans of the original Resident Evil video game. It is a theme park haunted house approach to creatures and monsters you will already know as a fan of the video game.Watch one of Romero's less known films instead if you want to have a good time. Monkey Shines is a particularly underrated little gem outside of the usual ____ of the Dead suggestions. Plus, it's pulpy and campy as anything, just like the old Resident Evils.",False
5,10,Romero's influence in the zombie genre,MaxShadows,n/a,15/08/2025,"This doccumentary is not only great for George Romero's and Resident Evil's fans, it's also a great incentive for those who haven't seen all of George Romero's films, it revisits Romero's most iconic films like Dawn of the dead and Day of the dead, while giving interesting facts you may not know about the making of his most-known movies and of course, of his canceled adaptation of Resident Evil. The ending makes you reflect on how much impact Romero has in the zombie genre.It also portrays the audience's reaction during that time toward the constant problems Romero's Resident Evil adaptation had, and how it all led to the badly adapted Resident Evil movie saga we all know.",False

7,10,Resident Evil Revisted,achievementhunter,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was a beautiful humane story of George Romero's stance; his core values outweighs what could've been. A fun directorate role from Brandon Salisbury, takes a re-watchable trip through not only memory lanes but unexplored areas. This is absolutely a much watch. As a fan of the original Biohazard/Resident Evil, it's insanely nice to see something relevant about the movie ideas from that 1996 masterpiece.For those who don't know, this movie stars Norman England (author of Behind the Kaiju Curtain) and James Rolfe makes a cameo as well. I appreciate the modern day influences taking place on this movie.",False
8,10,The Movie we should have got.,jamesmoslan,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you were a fan of the games in the mid 90s like myself and wanted that movie adaptation we never got this is for you. Brandon Salisbury's documentary offers a behind-the-scenes look at what happened and why the movie didn't turn out the way many fans expected. The storytelling helps fill in the gaps and explains the decisions and challenges that led to that 2002 film. It's also exciting to see how creators like Salisbury are digging deeper into gaming history and giving fans the stories they've been waiting for. Hopefully, his next project will be just as intriguing! What other game-to-film adaptations do you think deserve a similar deep dive?",False
9,10,"If you are a fan of Resident Evil, this film is for you.",austingreene-00549,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you are a fan of Resident Evil, this film is for you. After decades of on-screen adaptations, many fans of the games including myself felt as though the movies were not good representations of what made the games so captivating. This film works as an antidote to the lack felt by previous features, documenting what could have been had George A Romero's Resident Evil been fully realized. After many years of researching the topic, I was surprised to find that there were many details within this documentary that I was not aware of. This documentary was clearly made by people who were deeply passionate about Resident Evil as well as George A Romero. Must see!",False
10,10,Outstanding!,entwistlebassist,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well structured, informative and entertaining. This film is a love letter to Romero and what could have been Resident Evil. The director and his team worked long and hard to bring this to life, and I can say it was worth the wait. I was glued, beginning to end. It was nice to get a look into some of the archives and learn more about what could have been had Gerorge Romero adapted Resident Evil rather than what we got. It's explores more of what we already know as fans and expands on that, answering questions some of us had for years! If you're a fan of George Romero, Resident Evil, or both, this film is for you!",False
11,10,The Romero Blueprint for Survival Horror,analbumcover-93492,n/a,15/08/2025,"Speaking as a fan of both Romero's films as well as the Resident Evil franchise, this was a beautifully executed documentary that focused not only George's innate ability to provide social commentary in his own films, but also the influences those films made on all forms of media and the horror genre itself (post Of The Dead Era, from 'Night' to 'Day'). This film sheds an immense light not only on George's processes, but also brings to the forefront the frustrations and encroaching issues that he faced in trying to create a live adaptation of the original Resident Evil.Utilizing richly entailed information, sources, and rabbit hole deep research, the elements at play in regards to pre-production are on full display for all fans to see. The motif of a creative and visionary force dealing with studio interference and a classic case of someone trying to have their hands in the pot, when they don't even understand the recipe to even know how to cook.Not only is the documentary extremely structured, while paying its respects to Romero, it also shows the impact that the Resident Evil franchise has by taking a few of its core and significant elements and applying them for narration and transitions. Which for any die-hard Resident Evil fan, it will bring a smile to your face.The director and his production team showed a highly remarkable attention to detail and regard for Romero's name and legacy. It showcases those who have had the pleasure of working for him, with him or were ever positively influenced with his journey within the landscape of horror or film in general.I have read Romero's original draft from top to bottom, and its in my humble opinion that his rendition of Resident Evil, would have been the defining blueprint that could have set the tone and standard for what video game adaptions should have been. Similar to Tim Burton's Batman; when at that time, comic book movies could never be taken seriously for a successful adaptation, or could even seem like a box office draw. Burton's Batman then leaving an imprint of the Comic Book Film Industry, Romero's Resident Evil (in contrast to what we have already seen), would have been that for the Video Game Film Industry. Especially when during its time, video game adaptations were hardly successful.I hope this documentary gets a physical release, cause I personally would love to own it and add it to my Romero Blu Ray collection.And I wish George was still with us, so he could personally see for himself how much his work is valued and cherished. Even the work that he was never given the chance to complete.",False
12,10,"Lost Vision: A Love Letter to Romero, Resident Evil, and the Unrealized Masterpiece",screwthatmedia,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary not only sheds light on what might have been but also evokes a poignant sense of loss for the unrealized potential. As a devoted fan of both Resident Evil and George A. Romero, it was an easy decision to immerse myself in this well-researched, thoughtful, and thoroughly engaging piece of work.My fascination with this ""what could have been"" scenario began when I was around 10 or 11 years old (now approaching 30), and I've always wondered what went wrong. This documentary masterfully delivers the answers I sought, weaving together insightful interviews, memorable quotes, and an in-depth exploration of Romero's vision for Resident Evil. It's evident that the director approached this project with great care, assembling voices that not only respect the subject matter but also contribute vital information that has been absent from public discourse for years.The film feels like a heartfelt tribute to both Resident Evil and George A. Romero, while also offering a revealing glimpse into the workings of the film industry. It starkly illustrates how the influences that shaped the zombie and survival horror genres could not withstand corporate greed and a fundamental misunderstanding of the material.By the end, I was left with a bittersweet sense of fulfillment-grateful to experience even a fragment of Romero's unrealized vision, yet frustrated by the monumental missed opportunity on the part of Constantin Film. This documentary is not just an exploration of a cinematic ""what if"" but also a cautionary tale about creative compromise.I eagerly await the physical release, as it will undoubtedly become a cherished addition to my Resident Evil and horror collections. Even the artwork deserves special praise, standing as a testament to the collaborative effort behind this extraordinary documentary. It's more than a film; it's a celebration of passion, artistry, and what might have been.",False
13,10,A Love Letter to Both Resident Evil and Romero,peacekeeper52204,n/a,15/08/2025,"A well written and directed deep dive into the history of the man himself and one of the biggest missed opportunities in the history of video game adaptations. This was an entertaining watch from start to finish and I cannot recommend it more to anyone who appreciates either Resident Evil or Romero himself.The reenactments of the game and the break down of one of the script drafts in particular are highlights of this film, as well as the location they got to stand in for the Spencer Mansion.The seems to be, as far as I am aware, director Brandon Salisbury's first project and he shows real promise as this documentary is excellently executed.",False
14,10,A Masterpiece For Horror Fans And Gamers,awesker-65861,n/a,15/08/2025,I am a horror fan and a gamer fan. Resident evil is my favorite game series. I've seen a lot of horror movies and George was a genius. I remember seeing my dad walking through the door with the Nintendo GameCube and he put in Resident evil 4. I watched play the whole game and just watching him play it I got hooked into it. A few years later the GameCube got passed down to me and it was my turn to play it. Night Of Living Dead is a masterpiece and playing the older games definitely has its similarities with each other. George understood what survival horror is.Thank you Brandon Salisbury!!!!!,False
15,10,I miss George A. Romero.,jared-25331,n/a,15/08/2025,"George A. Romero is the godfather of the zombie horror genre and has given us some of the best horror movies of all time, so when I found out about this documentary about his initial idea for a Resident Evil Movie, I was excited for it. Well I just finished watching the documentary movie and it was absolutely spectacular.Positives for George A. Romero's Resident Evil (2025):
This documentary movie gibes us one of the biggest What If scenarios that never happened. Now I am a big fan of the Resident Evil franchise with Resident Evil 4 (2005) being my favorite video game of all time, so naturally it would've been appropriate for a movie adaptation of the games to be written and directed by this man. Now to be fair, he did make some changes to the games, but he still kept the core concept of the games intact with his initial draft. Sadly, Capcom and Sony Picture didn't allow that to happen and we got a lot of bad adaptations from Paul W. S. Anderson with Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2017) being one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. It was also great to see interviews with people praising Romero for what he did for the horror genre. I also loved learning about the making of Resident Evil games.Overall, George A. Romero's Resident Evil (2025) was a spectacular documentary movie and I hope one day we get the Resident Evil movie that will please movies fans and video game fans.",False
16,8,Romero's Resident Evil: A Must-See or Just Fan Service?,ApokalypseFM,n/a,15/08/2025,".::. English is not my native language, please take this into consideration when reading the following review .::.As a zombie fan and content creator for zombie themes, the ""George A. Romero's Resident Evil"" documentary was an absolute must-have. I pre-ordered the DVD and, of course, watched it immediately upon receipt, publishing a review on my channel..::. Content Focus .::.Romero's life's work and his influence on the zombie genre.His dark vision for the ""Resident Evil"" film and the reasons for his departure.The role of Konstantin Film and their rejection of Romero's approach.The work of the ""George A. Romero Foundation"" and the living legacy of Romero..::. Strengths .::.Detailed portrayal of Romero's creative vision.Atmospheric implementation: The documentary transports the viewer directly into the world of the first ""Resident Evil"" games with elements such as the DVD menu and the quote overlays. I often felt transported back to the first minutes of playing Resident Evil, with those doors in mind.It's simply grandiose that they managed to get Pablo Kuntz - the voice of Albert Wesker - to guide us through a documentary about a possible Resident Evil film by Romero that unfortunately never happened. (Yes, I'm serious, it's truly grandiose.) How ironic is it that none other than the voice of Albert Wesker leads us through this unrealized story?Interesting insights into the genesis of the project..::. Weaknesses .::.Avoids a critical examination of Romero. I would have liked more of that.One-sided portrayal of Konstantin Film and Paul W. S. Anderson.Critical comments about Romero's screenplay are interpreted as attacks, or rather, it comes across that way.!! - Little new information for Romero and ""Resident Evil"" experts. !!.::. Conclusion .::.The documentary is still a must-see for fans who want to learn more about the lost project. It offers exciting insights but avoids a comprehensive critical analysis. Romero's passion for the project is evident. And whoever gets the physical version does not have a dust catcher but a documentary that definitely gets a place in the collection.",False
17,9,Amazing film,milianzoe,n/a,15/08/2025,"Truth be told I have never played a Resident Evil game, but have seen bits and pieces along with watching others play. However, I feel like this documentary isn't as bad as some people make it out to be. In my personal opinion the title should of at least been a bit closer to tell people that this film is about George A. Romero's legacy and not only about Capcom and their videogames. A lot of care was put into the documentary with references to the Resident Evil franchise. I felt like it was very informative and well structured. Again I have not known the Resident Evil franchise long enough as most die-hard fans so possibly if you are already well informed on the information regarding the Resident Evil films then possibly you might not enjoy it as much because it would be a rehash of the same information. Again I enjoyed it because I didn't know much about the Resident Evil films that were in production.Also I do not understand where people are getting the idea that this film was made for profit when it is obviously stated the film is clearly for George A. Romero's legacy and his foundation to promote new filmmakers.",False

I can speak for most fans that were completely distraught about the Anderson films, but this really opens our eyes to the bureaucracy behind the movie world and how fan favorites can be halted.Thank you Brandon for making this instant masterpiece and congratulations on this being your first successful film, I look forward to more of your projects.",False
19,8,Romero - not a (Bio)Hazard (story),kosmasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"No pun intended - anyone who was lucky enough to have met the man, can and will tell you (like me), that he was the sweetest human being out there. And so humble - I don't think he ever really was able to grasp how many lives he changed! Directly or through his movies - which I reckon is also kind of directly.So I knew most of the stuff already that is being rolled up and off at the beginning, but you have to get to a point where everyone is on the same level of information. And that starts with background on the game Resident Evil - with enough players (actually producers) to give us insights.Yes Romero was a major influence ... if there is a disc version of this documentary, I do hope they include the ads (trailers) he did for Biohazard 2 (the Japanese name of the Resident Evil games) ... generally speaking I hope there is more on an disc version.A lot of players are missing (Tom Savini to name just one of his greatest collaborators). So while this is mainly focused (or supposed to) on Resident Evil ... there are personal touches on his life too. And the foundation his wife brought to ... well life after his death.One documentary is not enough to do the man justice of course - and the reading of the script (or the scenes within) that never was made ... but probably would have been at least as good as the one they eventually did ... well it is heartbreaking ... but it is what it is ... the German production company decided to go the commercial route ... I reckon you can't blame them - but you can still hate them ... a nice little documentary with some insights and new information I reckon for those interested.",False
20,10,My Favorite Documentary of 2025 So far.,WolfCowboy05,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is my favorite Documentary of 2025 so far. It's really a shame that The Script wasn't finished by George A Romeo. This Documentary was extremely amazing. It's really a darn shame that George A Romeo's Resident Evil Movie never happened and if in a alternative Timeline/Universe It could've been extremely way better than The Other Live Action Resident Evil Films and T.

I really recommend this to Resident Evil Fans. Perfect.",False

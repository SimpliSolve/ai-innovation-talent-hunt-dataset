1,5,The War on Children.,bombersflyup,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""The War On Children"" exposes the ongoing battle for control of the next generation and their minds. This film reveals the battle plan being used to control the future. To win this war you have to understand the tactics of your enemy.Firstly I don't think this is the most insightful documentary, as everyone would be aware of most of these things. Plus the manner in which it's done by interviews, could basically be pooled online, despite them being there asking the questions. Hell turn on a TV these days, every commercial is cringe. It's disturbing and pure evil and well evil always wins out don't they. If Trump were to win the election, they'd probably need to start with voluntary parent teachers in some capacity. The baby being nipple fed by the aroused man has never crossed my mind and will continue to disturb me however.",True
2,9,Very telling,jonschmitt-13392,n/a,16/08/2025,"You may not agree with the Starbuck's politics or views, but none of that matters. At its very core this is truly telling about the role that social media companies are trying to take on in our children's lives. These FACTS are becoming more and more obvious in everyday life. Would recommend to any parent no matter your political or life views. The fact that people involved in the industry are not willing to talk about it is even more telling. The Starbucks do an amazing job dealing with facts and attempting to talk to different folks about their views and findings. While also giving those who don't agree with them a platform to justify why they disagree. At the very least we should all be able to have a civil conversation about issues affecting todays young children.",False
3,10,Everyone NEEDS to watch this.,alysemichaelis,n/a,16/08/2025,"I highly recommend this movie to everyone. Regardless of what political party you lean towards, EVERYONE needs to be a warrior for the safety, health, and protection of children. They are the future of our world, and the USA. This movie provided so much insight into a topic that I wanted to understand more. As a parent of a young girl, I want to be knowledgeable about everything my daughter may face in the future and I want to be prepared to educate her. The Starbuck family is absolutely amazing for producing this content and working hard to release it. I will be sharing this with other families and friends in the hopes that one day, this will be available on all streaming platforms.Children need to be protected and values need to be realigned. God bless everyone.",False
4,1,If you want your biases confirmed - go for it!,deux-22113,n/a,16/08/2025,"The War On Children (2024) is a documentary that seems to be more interested in pushing a particular narrative than in presenting a balanced view of its subject matter. It's a classic case of confirmation bias, serving up exactly the kind of content its target audience wants to hear, without challenging any preconceived notions or offering any new insights.The film's approach is reminiscent of the sensationalist tactics often employed by certain media outlets, with its heavy reliance on fear-mongering and divisive rhetoric. It's a strategy that may appeal to some, but for those looking for a more nuanced and thoughtful exploration of the issues at hand, it leaves much to be desired.In the end, The War On Children (2024) is a documentary that reflects the polarized state of our current discourse. It's a film that will likely resonate with viewers who share its worldview, but for those hoping for a more balanced and objective analysis, it may prove to be a disappointing watch.",False
5,10,Knowledge is Power - Empower Yourself!,IlliniJen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. Be ready to go through all of the emotions: anger, disbelief, despair, curiosity, guilt, hope, and contentment. Robby and Landon delivered with this film! Between the solid selection of experts, the youth focus group, the effective incorporation of imagery and videos, and the sequence of events, it all came together perfectly to bring home a POWERFUL message about the indoctrination of our children.Whether you have your own children or not, this film is a MUST see for those who refuse to live under a rock. Whether you are Republican or Democrat, you will be equipped with knowledge that will empower you to decide on how you view and address this crisis that continues to impact our society.",False
6,1,Buckle up ðŸ™„,xmhhrhtqp,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was... *sigh
It was a fever nightmare made of Alt-right fear mongering satire, sadly
I went into this, not knowing much about it other than the movie description given. Boy, was I surprised! I think my biggest disappointment came with the fact that the movie had plenty of opportunities to actually shine a light on the dangers children are facing online, elsewhere and what have you. But they chose to cater to a specific audience, knowing that it would resonate with them and them alone. Therefore, isolating itself from becoming what it actually could have been. Instead, it was riddled with dog whistles.",False
7,10,Facts to Protect Your Child,kevingn,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an excellent film. It opened my eyes to the social media dangers that are out there for my child. I learned many FACTS regarding this entire social contagion. I was shocked to learn how much pornography is pushed on young people when they are on their smartphones. This movie is really must-see. It is amazing how our kids are preyed upon and left to fend for themselves. Whether you are conservative, liberal, or somewhere in between, you will gain a lot by watching this film. After watching it, I think you will be better equipped to help your child navigate these very, very dangerous waters.",False
8,1,Can anyone say CONFIRMATION BIAS?,vexedapes,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you already believe everything this ""documentary"" purports, then I'm sure you absolutely love it. For everyone else, don't even waste your time. Flimsy or non-existent evidence and completely invalid interpretations of scientific data. The Starbucks cherry pick information that suits their purposes, and conveniently exclude everything else. Many times they state their opinions, but present them as widely accepted truths. Their attempt to broach this topic in a fair manner and with the ""other side"" was essentially non-existent. This film will soon be lost and forget, as it should be. No wonder he wasn't elected.",False
9,10,Knowledge is power,bratkidevr,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a powerful documentary. I don't care what your political or religious views are.....everyone needs to watch this. Robby and Landon Starbuck did a masterful job bringing the truth to life. This documentary is backed by facts that anyone can research and see. It is very telling that the media is already trying to discredit this movie. This documentary has pulled back a curtain to reveal a very dark and very real threat to our children. It is a very thought provoking movie. On the other hand it is also a very scary movie. It is one of the most powerful documentaries that I have ever watched.,False
10,1,As convincing as Dr Crippens' defence lawyer.,ryanchristopherwilliams,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bears the same resemblance to a proper documentary that sawdust does to a living tree.It's essentially a series of talking points beaded together in a grim parody of coherence. Presumably this was why the makers effectively lied to the people that agreed to appear in it and resorted to heavily editing their interviews to get the soundbites they actually wanted. This, like the maker's approach, lends them a paper-thin appearance of objectivity whilst pushing a fairly toxic message.All on behalf, of course, who imagine that everyone up to and including the postman is doing the same thing against them.For fundies and Fox News addicts only.",False
11,10,A wake up call parents,gyvxiat,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary discusses the sensitive issue that almost everyone is avoiding. I sent the link (thru X) to my friends even the ones who are on the other side or maybe at the fence but they are willing to watch and listen. At least a dialogue can open up discussion for sake of the children and the generations to come. I did actually have high hopes on the young adults who are awake and conscious of what is going on with their generation. If this documentary can actually be on major streaming platforms, uncensored, it can reach more parents and young adults. This needs to be shared to everyone you know. Thank you.",False
12,10,Parents and future parents need to see this.,smccabling,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is proof that you cant let the school systems or social media babysit or raise your children. The facts presented in this are frightening but are a reality. This movie will make a lot of people angry, but information is very important now adays. The Starbuck family makes an incredible case in this. And while it is very upsetting, you need to understand that this is the reality of the world we live in. They bring the receipts in this movie. Regardless of what political side you the fence you stand on, our children are being groomed and indoctrinated by the very people you thought were there to help protect them in most cases. And those that are not. Be vigilant and protect our blessings.",False
13,9,A must watch for all adults,heatherlsbritt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very informative and eye opening to what our children are exposed to. Many parents may be aware of these issues but if you don't have kids it is vital you understand that you are needed to help protect the innocent. The documentary is very well produced and the pacing is amazing. Often documentaries lack fast enough pace to keep you interested but the Starbucks do a great job with content and presentation. Very compelling and heart wrenching at times.Some will try to label this as ""right wing"", but they did try to interview people from both sides (they document this in the last third of the film) and most often were rejected by law makers and activist who claim to be ""progressive"" or on the left. Watch the whole thing before you decide.",False
14,10,Powerful!,camillegable,n/a,16/08/2025,"So well done and documented, thank you for putting this movie together to open our eyes to the extensive harm being done to our precious children. Wish it was required for all college students to watch. Everyone should be aware of the deception and lies that are being promoted in our country in the name of science. Once innocence is lost it is impossible to get back. You have gone to battle for the children and I pray for protection over your beautiful family. Thank you for this incredibly well done film. I appreciate you and see that you are making a difference in such a great way. Blessings!",False
15,10,Simply breathe taking,maikel911,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just find it by accident , I started to watch it a little bit skeptical but it's really refreshing a with a very powerful message. The story is very compelling, the interviews were really interesting and they covered every aspect that you as a parent needed to know in order to protect our children of all kinds of dangers there are right now in our society including but not limited to an ideology.I was really touched by the fight that many people are doing to get involved in this crusade against the existence of this problem and I encourage to everyone that has the opportunity to promote this movement continue until the end.",False
16,10,Bravo! Awesome documentary! The truth has to be told loud and clear! We need to fight for our children!,elenamiller,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great documentary and true! If we don't fight for our children will loose them to others that have no interest in their wellbeing, but just in manipulating them, ruining their bodies and minds, even pushing them into committing suicide. Thank you for making this important documentary and taking a stand. Should be largely shared by everyone that watched it and sees the truth about these people destroying our children, their lives, their future. We need more like you and more documentaries on this subject. The atac on our children has to STOP!A Congressional committee has to be held and STOP this abuse!",False
17,10,"I never really watch documentaries, nor give 10/10's",nmceachin-07031,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was wild to watch, if you watch it though you will see a side of America you're unaware of, or at least I was. I do not have any children and am on 28, so I rarely think of high school education. I just figured it was like it was when I was a child. This documentary showed some incredibly scary and important thing while continuing to site their sources.This documentary is anti LGBT being pushed on kids, but never came off anti LGBT. They even tried to get a number of people from the LGBT community to come on the documentary, but they wouldn't alllow themselves to be interviewed. The one person they got to join that was pro LGBT for children was a professional drag queen, and his/her interview didn't go very well.I do not have a stance on LGBT communities, but I definitely have a stance on manipulating people especially children, and it seems like a lot of children are being manipulated. I know this has happened for all of time, but this time it's with mutilation and experimentations on children. The fact it's in the open is even scarier.Don't mean to offend, but I'd definitely worth a watch.",False
18,10,"If you don't think it applies to you and YOUR family, think again.",stonej-35519,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who has been sitting in the sidelines for many years, quietly accepting the new ""facts of life"", I watched the entire documentary (had to take breaks to process but did finish it), and it makes me, historically a passive observer, shoulder shrugger, low assertiveness level parent, want to confront anyone who accepts trans propaganda, shake them, and wake them up. If we do not stand up and oppose now, our children will grow up in the culture of ""going to jail for misgendering"" and ""losing their own kids to the state"" for not affirming and allowing their bodies to be mutilated. Must watch for all parents in ""progressive"" countries. It may seem innocent now. The direction is heading to is not. Watch and educate yourself before it's too late.",False
19,10,Very well done - MUST SEE,ksearl-24175,n/a,16/08/2025,"Starbuck's 'The War on Children' is a film about a very difficult subject that people too often won't talk about. This documentary is relatively easy to watch, though heartbreaking and angering in spots. I found it overall engaging, educational, relatable, and juuuust provocative enough to help the average viewer to more clearly see the bigger picture. The dots are connected between predatory media, medical, and education groups to show how they seek to capture our children in ways that permanently alter their lives. A great film for teens and adults. Could also be great in a classroom setting but should be pre-screened for sensitivity. This is an important watch and a great achievement!",False

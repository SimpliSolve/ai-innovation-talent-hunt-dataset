1,7,quest for respect,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. I'll admit to knowing very little about professional wrestling, so this was the first I had heard about actor David Arquette's scandal from nearly 20 years ago, as he promoted his movie READY TO RUMBLE (2000). Documentarian David Darg and Video director Price James collaborate here as co-directors to deliver a documentary on one of the strangest, most off-the-wall stories I've ever seen ... and one that fits well with the reputation of the professional wrestling world.In a sport that thrives on good guy vs bad guy, David Arquette became the most hated man in wrestling. The power brokers in the industry determined a publicity stunt with his becoming WCW Champion would lead to a boon for the business. The fan and wrestler backlash was harsh and severe, and Arquette claims it made him persona non grata in both the sport and in Hollywood, though his math doesn't add up. He discloses his ""10 years of rejections"" for acting roles, when the wrestling brouhaha goes back 20 years. And on top of that, he has worked pretty consistently over those two decades - albeit mostly in projects that don't appeal to mainstream audiences.So all these years later, here comes David Arquette in his attempt to re-enter the world of wrestling and gain respect from those that think he disrespected their beloved sport. The temptation here is to label the documentary and Arquette a joke, but he seems so sincere in his desire to find his way, that we catch ourselves following his journey with interest. And it's not always easy to do so. There is one moment in particular: Arquette is wearing a purple bedazzled wizard cape while sitting on a horse and vaping, when he states, ""I'm sick of being a joke"". Umm.Arquette is likely best known for his role in the SCREAM movies, of which there were four between 1996 and 2011, and a fifth is on the way for 2021. Or perhaps he is best known as the ex-husband of ""Friends"" star Courteney Cox, with whom he has a daughter. Then again, maybe his fame is derived from being part of a family entrenched in entertainment. This includes his acting sisters Rosanna, Patricia and Alexis (who died in 2016), brother Richmond, father Lewis (a well-established character actor), and grandfather Cliff, who created the popular character Charley Weaver.We meet Arquette's wife Christine McLarty (who looks like she could be Courteney Cox's younger sister), a career news reporter who is now a film producer, and she seems to share our confusion on why David is pursuing this at age 46 - after a heart attack, which resulted in stints and blood thinners. When he speaks of his previous alcoholism, anxiety, and other mental and physical health issues, we hope this is his way of improving his health. However, as we follow him on the road, we realize, it really is about the wrestling and redemption.The journey leads to a ""backyard wrestling"" match where amateurs looking to humiliate the actor pretty much beat the heck out of him. It's at this point where he decides to train, and heads off to a facility in Virginia, followed by Cancun and Tijuana street wrestling, segments that prove quite entertaining. The pride of a wrestling match is mentioned, and we watch a ROCKY segment where Arquette chases a chicken, and is called ""crazy white boy"" while a Spanish version of ""The Last Kiss"" is played. I warned you this was a strange one.At times we can't help but think this is a hoax in the same way in which Joaquin Phoenix parlayed his acting ""retirement"" into I'M STILL HERE, a mockumentary on his pursuit of a hip hop career. The difference is that Arquette really trains and really wrestles, ending with a match at the ""Legends of Wrestling"" in Detroit against Ken Anderson. This is a film that feels like a gag when it starts, but very real by the end. It's not enough to motivate me to go back and watch some of those terrible David Arquette movies, but it's enough to tip my cap to a man pursuing respect and redemption.",False
2,8,Very Entertaining,stephenrattigan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Enjoyable Documentary.. David is eccentric but very entertaining, wrestling fans should enjoy",False
3,8,David Arquette is a funny fella,imseeg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hearing about David Arquette wanting to get into wrestling sounded like a joke to me at first. Like it being a kind of fake documentary just to have some fun and draw some attention, like Joaquin Phoenix did when he said he wanted to become a hiphop rapper. But David Arquette was actually really devoted to wrestling, even as a young kid he always was fascinated by it.Of course David Arquette was never really serious of truly becoming a wrestler, but he just wanted to experience the thrill for REAL. And it is a lot of fun watching him get ridiculed and fysically smacked around. He even got seriously injured and was escorted to the hospital by his friend Luke Perry, who later died of a stroke, which devasted David Arquette.Concluding: this documentary is a lot of fun to watch, because David Arquette is a really funny fella. He is kind of deranged in a very pleasant kind of way, because who would dare take the chance of getting into wrestling, while just having had a heart attack a year before? David Arquette did and boy what great fun it is to watch him make a complete ass of himself. But he genuiningly enjoyed himself while doing so...",False
4,7,Are you ready to rumble?,Pjtaylor-96-138044,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the early 2000s, David Arquette entered the world of professional wrestling to promote 'Ready To Rumble (2000)'. After a few matches, he received the world title in a scripted scenario designed to draw attention to the sport. This didn't go down well with most wrestling fans, who saw it as a slap in the face to not only them but also the wrestlers who devoted their entire lives getting ready to rumble. Arquette's introduction to wrestling was already seen as a Hollywood handout, a bad joke played at the expense of the true fans, but his winning of the title was the icing on the cake. Arquette was the most hated wrestler, maybe even person, in the world... at least, that's what it felt like to him. It took twenty years, but Arquette finally decided he didn't want to be taken as a joke anymore; he decided to prove all of wrestling fandom wrong; he decided to re-enter the world of professional wrestling for real.The result of that re-entry is 'You Cannot Kill David Arquette (2020)', a documentary that details the actor's very real reintegration into the community he had been ostracised from. It's essentially a vanity piece, a portrait of a surprisingly likeable yet undeniably flawed would-be Hollywood star (that's right, Hollywood ostracised him too). Whether Arquette is picking at old wounds out of a genuine desire to finish what he started or out of a need to reactivate the relevance he believes was so cruelly stolen from him is almost irrelevant. As is the blurry line between scripted and sincere, which reflects wrestling's own sly subversions of reality. The only thing that matters is that the end result is an endearing and involving experience that takes you on a distinct journey along with its star. Arquette appears to have an honest passion for wrestling, able to list off a whole host of childhood favourites. His bitterness towards his career is balanced with his joy for the sport, the sense that he truly cares what the fans think and is only seeking to prove that he always took them as seriously as he wants them to take him. When his infectious energy is met with good faith, the wrestling sequences are surprisingly fun (unlike the stories they tell, the matches are real). When it's met with bad faith, however, they're downright upsetting. On two occasions, Arquette is subjected to a match in which his opponents seek to make an example of him, to do him harm for the damage they believe he did to their livelihoods. The worst of these sees Arquette in the hospital with a life-threatening wound on the neck, the result of a sadistic series of slashings that surely can't have been part of the plan. It's painful, unpleasant and impossible to look away from; you feel as though a friend is being hurt in front of you, but you can't do anything except will them to survive. Thankfully, these moments highlight Arquette's determination and genuine nature, while also portraying his opponents as petty and cruel. In the context of the whole journey, they're almost necessary dark points. That's because the narrative framing of the documentary makes sure to position it as a tale of redemption. Whether this reflects real life is, as always, debatable, but it sure makes for an entertaining affair. Though it sometimes lacks real drive and generally feels rather 'made for TV', the picture is an enjoyable and affecting affair throughout. It isn't overly vain or self-involved, painting Arquette and his journey in a good light (which I'm sure is its intention) without feeling false or shying away from the darker elements of either aspect. It's a good documentary that's entertaining even for those who are apathetic towards professional wrestling.",False
5,9,I have a newfound respect for Arquette,DeadMansTrousers,n/a,16/08/2025,"Growing up in the 90s I was the prime audience for the David Arquette phenomena but I never realised how truly passionate he was about wrestling. This documentary was extremely entertaining and left me with even more respect for him as a person, I highly recommend it.",False
6,7,Entertaining,valleyjohn,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's no secret that Wrestling isn't real . It's staged entertainment masquerading as sport and I have to say I used to enjoy it when my kids were younger. We even went to watch WWE live a couple of times.The fans take it extremely seriously and the name David Arquette is mud due to the fact that he won a world title , years ago , undeservedly in their eyes.This follows Arquette in his comeback to wresting and I have to say , like the wrestling back in the day , I really enjoyed it.It took me a while to figure out if this was a mockumentary or was it real ? At first I thought it was as fake as the sport , but as the more it went on and the more fitter he got , I began to realise this was actually real.There are to wresting matches that are highlight of the film . The first was a backyard fight where he was totally unprepared and the second one was a brutal , nasty fight where he is stabbed in the neck with a lighting tube .Great for the documentary but with blood gushing out of his neck , he really could have died .As entertaining documentaries go , this is right up there . Thoroughly enjoyable and eye opening to what goes on in the amateur wrestling scene .",False
7,9,David Arquette cements his status as a BADASS!!,Corkscrew84productions,n/a,16/08/2025,"At the center of this documentary it's all about a man just trying to earn the respect of his peers. I really love how you get this inmate look into David's life with his family and everything he goes through you can see he just wants to not be a joke anymore in the wrestling industry and earn the respect of his peers in the business. throughout this doc you see him put his body through hell to earn the respect of his peers as well as redeem his self to the fans. I really love the trials and tribulations of him dealing with janky promoters to wrestling convention signings to even god damn death match with Nick Gage. One of my favorite parts of the film is when he goes to Tijuana, Mexico to train with some wrestlers. Wrestling in traffic at red lights for change evening hitting a ladder spot. So if you a fan of David Arquette or heard about the death match or even watch WCW back in the day I think you'll like this documentary. not to mention its beautifully shot. Its a solid 9/10 for me. I also have a YouTube channel where we just dropped a review for this movie would love if you guys checked it out at Matt and Garrett take the movies dropping videos every Monday @6pm EST",False
8,7,Mental Issues,sucraf,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe film was very interesting but David obviously has mental issues. How and why would his family and doctors allow him to wrestle? He had a heart attack and a lot of other body issues. The biggest issue I had was that his current wife was 2.0 of Courtney Cox. That was just gross.,True
9,9,Really really good,brett-76260,n/a,16/08/2025,I can honestly say I along with thousands of other fans I never took David serious about anything. This show actually changed my mind and I have come full circle on my opinion of him as a actor and wrestler. Have to give him all the credit for going through what he did to clear his name in the wrestling community. This show was done outstanding and very well made. Its much much better than I ever would have expected and is well worth watching. Great job David on this documentary and your dedication to the sport.,False
10,10,Powerful if true. Poignant if acting.,shughm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've always dug David Arquette in movies. Scream, Eight-Legged Freaks, Ready to Rumble-all childhood favorites.But to see such a humanizing aspect of the man's personality added a depth to my appreciation of him. For growing up within an acting dynasty, to his personal struggles, and desire for nothing more than respect-dude's tough as nails.I watched this expecting a schlocky self-parody, to shedding tears. I definitely recommend. Let's hope to see him in roles with more depth (even if I'm eagerly awaiting Scream 5).",False
11,5,Too much of a work to be what it should've been.,rochfordsimon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary was well produced and great cinematography. The hook and plot was so so.Disappointed in this as it had the makings to be great. Instead it's more choreographed than Pro-Wrestling. The broken childhood, past relationships, addictions and current mental health issues should have been the core focus of why david returned to wrestling. Then it should have shown his self abusive treatment of himself doing the same. And in the end, the real heroes were his family that loved and accepted him! The documentary hinted at these things but never engaged them fully.He is around the past superstars of wrestling, knows all the marquee names. But yet, he gets trained by gloried back yarders and wannabes of pro-wrestling! The bottom feeders. Why? If I want to be an actor, do I go to my local drama group that impersonates scenes from their favourite movies all day long? Also, he hasn't had and acting gig in 10 years, but in the credits he is on the set of a movie acting!! The producers and directors forgot to include, Kayfabe, lol.From around 40+ mins in this documentary picks up and ends short about 10 mins before it finishes.The lightubes in the beginning are laughed off as stunts in a backyard. But much later in the documentary he gets seriously injured by one. This was legit, but hard to take as such. Due to the earlier tomfoolery with Back Yard guys. This should have been a big drama piece, but was meh!Then they aim to make you believe the wrestler in the black and white promo, shown at the beginning and end, really wants to hurt David etc etc. But when it's over, you see a shot of the said wrestler (Ken Anderson) slapping him in congratulations with a dozen other people!!! Why not have a piece where he shakes David's hand saying ""I respect you now. Your one of us."" ??His wife dresses up as Miss Elizabeth and goes to the ring with him. This came across as a fetish cosplay gimmick. Why didn't they communicate David being unsure of himself and his wife tells him, ""You're my Macho Man and I'm gonna support you out there"" then she goes gets dressed as Elizabeth and briefly explains shes a symbol of women supporting their men in hard times etc. When you can show and not tell, its masterful. But this set up fell flat.I'll stop. This was a decent watch, but fell short of the finish line while dropping all its valuables along the way. Check it out anyway.",True
12,9,A hard working man who doesn't care about critics.,stoermok,n/a,16/08/2025,"I personally had and still have a fond love for wrestling. Back in 2010 the business was on it's peak, it came down a little bit, but there's a new wave going around.I think it's a story about Arquette proving the world wrong, he proved if you put your mind to it you can do it, even with the little blocks you have on the road. He pretty much sealed people mouths when it came to his WCW critics.I think there are a decent amount of very well done cinematography shots in here and also very well edited.I didn't know Luke Perry had a son in professional wrestling, in which he is doing pretty good from what i've been following, but i immediately recognized him. I loved the memorial they had at the end.If you want to see familiar faces and also had/have a niche for the sport then i'd recommend watching it.",False
13,10,"Absolutely insane, and crazy good",haskel-72951,n/a,16/08/2025,"This may be the most completely off the charts nuts thing I've ever seen. Arquette is genuine in his love for wrestling and to make amends for what many feel is a two decade old slap in the face. As a documentary, it is insightful, thought provoking and flat out entertaining. Others have said David has mental problems. Maybe, but I think he is just very eccentric. He also has a big heart , and that comes through strong here.",False
14,8,Truth is only found inside your soul.,Agent10,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having been friends with people that actively watched wrestling-from WWE, WCW and even ECW-the very mention of David Arquette's name was not especially relevant. To my friends, there were far worse things than David Arquette winning a title. There was the mystery of Owen Hart, the Montreal Screw Job, Randy Savage turning his back on Hulk Hogan, Chris Benoit, and even a wide assortment of terrible costumes and ideas. There was even a one legged wrestler named Zach Gowan who took more punishment than any other fighter in history. ""God"" even headlined a match once. They even had a stereotyped handicap wrestler named Eugene. David Arquette was bad in the eyes of wrestling fans, but c'mon. Brock Lesnar threw a one-legged wrestler down a flight of stairs and even knocked over his stretcher once....in front of the wrestler's mom. Jay Leno won a fight for crying out loud.For me, the absolute anger caused by Arquette was palpable. Who wouldn't want to be heavyweight champion? Anyway, the grudge carried by wrestling fans was real, so real that Arquette took it upon himself to bring pride and honor to his name....even if no one really witnessed the journey.The documentary starts off weird enough. Arquette is a typical dad bod with multiple kids, including a daughter that is embarrassed by everything he does within a metric kilometer from her. An epiphany hits Arquette after getting beat up at a backyard wrestling ""event."" The road paved with fluorescent tube shards and push pins would have to be traversed, with or without shoes.Arquette trains in Mexico, Virginia and even sets up a ring in his back yard (much to the chagrin of his wife) to prove this is for real. He goes through the motions, winning, losing and even nearly losing his life (which that entire part was eye popping). In the end, he is named one of the 500 best wrestlers in the world, earns respect from those that chastises him and even gets to live out a fetish fantasy.Now the first half of the film is bizarre. It felt like this was a joke being played out for fun but when we see Arquette cry over a signed mask from a luchador fighter-which is an honor-we fully understand this is for real. Of course, the instant Harvey Levin shows up in TMZ clips, you know this is real life.The second half of the film has some really deep life affirming stuff, and I will not ruin it for the reader. But be ready, for you will be surprised and saddened. I'm sure David Arquette thought this film would be just a fun idea and an interesting look into his own soul. Instead, it became a fascinating character study shaped in real life. Bravo Mr. Arquette...bravo.",False
15,10,Thank You David!!!!,batfan-75719,n/a,16/08/2025,That's all I can say after watching this!!!! What an incredible look into his life. I'm a FAN and always will be. Give this a watch and I promise you won't be disappointed.,False
16,1,"Strange, not in a good way.",ferdmalenfant,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you thought David Arquette was strange and full of himself before, this movie will definitely make you hate him. Boring garbage. Who makes these thinking it's going to make money. So BAD.",False
17,9,Laugh! Cry! Gasp!,blueblazer530,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDavid Arquette, at one point one of Hollywood's most promising young actors, became the World Championship Wrestling Heavyweight Champion in the year 2000!
Considered by many wrestling fans as the worst moment in professional wrestling history, Arquette not only was laughed out of the wrestling world, he lost all credibility with Hollywood. So why does he want to go back 18 years later?
This documentary traces Arquette's quixotic quest for redemption, respect, and a wrestling gimmick. Putting his career, marriage and even his life on the line, Arquette goes to extreme, hardcore measures to finally be accepted in the wrestling world.
Even if you're not at all familiar with wrestling, or a B-List actor that come from an artistic, talented family of actors, you'll be fascinated by the insane questionable decisions Arquette makes in order to fulfill his dreams. Yet, you might wind up rooting for him.
Often funny, quirky, and at times horrifically violent, ""You Cannot Kill David Arquette"" will leave you inspired. I mean how can you not cheer for a middle aged has-been actor who has barely survived a heart attack just a year prior to filming this documentary? Cheer at his child-like glee at entering the wrestling ring! Gasp in horror as he nearly bleeds out from a severed Carotid Artery! Feel your heartstrings plucked as El Maldito honorably gifts his luchador mask to David! Cry as David is shunned at WrestleCon by the wrestling fans, often considered to be the most thoughtful, passionate, and critical thinkers of all the fandoms!",True
18,9,Very entertaining journey for wrestling fans and non-fans alike,stevenastark,n/a,16/08/2025,"Arquette is a likeable, interesting character. He comes across as very eccentric and sensitive and at times you feel you're watching a mid-life crisis play out. The story is also full of fun and humour. Plenty of wrestling legends make appearances and although some sequences feel contrived you can forgive them, as when the lines between performance and reality are blurred often the most memorable moments in wrestling occur-see the infamous Montreal screwjob for example.Arquette creates quite a few memorable moments of his own, from the comical and heartfelt to the outright disturbing.I recommend sticking around for the outtakes during the end credits.",False
19,9,Interesting doc,xsycknessx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Good doc but its clear this dudes jacked up, and the heart stints seal it. Dudes a huge fan but never knew to goto a school for it? Theres schools and trainers all over the world. Its a sad show that this guys fckd up and probably gonna kill himself. Trying after a dream that was likely unobtainble in what woulda been his ""prime"" 30 years ago. The whole things depressing",False
20,10,amazing movie love to see David have some redemption,buckeyefanohiostate,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was a wrestling fan as a kid and i watched how after David got the wcw championship the company started falling off really fast and how a lot of fans blamed David me it blamed Vice Russo & Eric Bishop!! i heard about this documentary on a Stevo Podcast had me very interested and i wasnt disappointed at all, always had liked david he was a pretty fun dude who looked like he was just trying to have fun! really enjoyed how great this documentary is highly recommend",False
21,4,Story of real mental health issues,rocky-31943,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis story of DA an actor stuck in goof ball roles, turned one time wrestler and champion, highlights the real concern of this man's mental instability. Clearly there is a lot going on with DA all of which are concerning, 46 year old man living in the past 20years earlier in his wcw appearance.An avid wrestling fan with the money and Hollywood connection to try follow his dream to be taken seriously in wrestling.DA clearly shows he is mentally unstable, stuck with the mental capacity of a 16 year old boy wanting to live his dream.Movie is ok, I hope David get help true mental help for whatever is affecting him.",True
22,10,Amazing production,jhunt-66499,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you enjoy documentaries, this is a must see. You do not have to be a fan of David Arqutte to respect this movie. I never gave him a second thought until I stumbled across this gem on a flight from Boston to Dallas.",False
23,9,"An honest look into wrestling, and David Arquette",niritcat-10009,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDidn't know what to expect, but this blew me away. Can't believe how gutsy this guy is - he chose to throw himself back into the ring, over and over again, even after getting smashed and almost killed. And he's really good at wrestling, too - even though he's over 45, a heart attack and alcohol.I also have a new respect for wrestling and wrestlers. This is actually a really tough couples sport, requiring strength, guts stamina, athletic and acting skills, practice, planning, and a trust between rivals (and not be a total savage, crazy, a-hole, like two of David's opponents).Great movie, hard to watch at times, but definitely worth it.",True
24,10,Respect Well Earned,Ghostofthewoods,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never had any hate for David and it seems obscured that anyone would - all because he was given the WCW title back in the day? Come on, wrestling is as much about showbiz and entertainment as it is about the hard knocks. Stories are all part of the business and the fact people still talk about the him winning the title 20 years on goes to show that it had the intended result - exposure to the masses. It's only keyboard warriors and jealousy that fuel any animosity.Now on to the show. In my opinion it was entertaining, but I felt it was about chasing acceptance and proving a point - one that to me didn't need proving, but to David it seemed vitally important, which I can understand.David has a big set of balls! That's for sure! And I hope he proved to himself what he's capable of, and I also hope the wrestling community appreciates his journey - a journey that most people wouldn't have the guts to travel. Wrestling is a hard way of life - more dangerous than boxing and MMA in my opinion, and the guys and girls that do it don't get anywhere near enough respect for their athletic abilities and physical and mental toughness.I hope David found some solace in the making of this documentary and can move forward and enjoy life with his family.Point proven and respect certainly earned, my friend!",False

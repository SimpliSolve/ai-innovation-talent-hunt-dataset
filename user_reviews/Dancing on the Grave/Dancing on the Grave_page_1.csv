1,7,Thrill,kalpeshkotaria,n/a,16/08/2025,"True story picturised well but old footages ,as per that time,are not upto today's standards. Eventhen worth watching.However the *MMM* seems to have been falsely implicated as there are no eyewitness nor the evidence picturised evidences are as per today's time.Moreover he was already behind the bars for more than 30 years now so needs review or mercy.One can watch and enlighten oneself as far as human psyche is concerned.Well tried as brought the real characters and their verbatim presentation .Once again worth watching and analysing.

2,6,Missed Opportunities: A Review of Dancing on the Grave,iknafilms,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Dancing On The Grave"" is a docuseries that re-examines the sensational case of Shakereh Khaleeli, who went missing in 1991 and was later discovered buried alive in a wooden casket at her home in Bangalore, India, with her second husband as the prime suspect.The docuseries about Shakereh's death is good, but it could have been better. It focuses too much on recreating scenes and imagining things, instead of talking about important things like religion and class differences. The show is curious about the details, but it loses focus and doesn't trust the audience. It needed more grace and reserve when dealing with such a haunting subject. Overall, it's still a good true-crime show for fans, but it could have been even better if it had focused more on important issues and trusted the audience more.",False
3,7,Excellent Story; Remarkable Cinematography; Rubbish Storytelling!,rifatuls,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing story with some story that needs to be heard! Human at their most brutal sight and without even a beat from their heart. Rarest of the Rarest!However very bad way of narrating the story! If I had not got recommendations from relevant people K might have stopped watching it the story was breaking every single time something came to surface. First two episodes were nothing but unnecessarily vague way of projecting the main hook of the storyline.But i will have to commend the cinematography and the footage collection. Very much gave the whole thing a life and did not only had to walk on the story tellers abilities.Nonetheless, it is a Must Watch, even to put a tribute to the subject!",False
4,6,The hindu priest needs to stay in jail,Innacana,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another indian show showing how useless indian polices are. All these indian crime shows in Netflix and Amazon portrays how incompetent are indian polices.Shraddhananda is the culprit for this heinous crime there is no doubt. Even his statement with the interviewers has many plotholes and questionable arguments. Every other witness statements, including the maids, contradicts with his version of the story. And of course with some evidences like the wooden box. This criminal hindu priest's lawyer seems to be another hindu sympathizer and his baseless logical arguments made no sense.Shakereh Khaleeli made some unfortunate decisions in her life and she paid a hefty price for that in life and after death. Her daughter made many silly mistakes as well after suspecting her mother was missing, which was not highlighted in this series. How can she wait 3 years with her mother missing?I agree with other commenters that there are no real twists in the story and could have been made in under 1 hour video. Why make it slow and lengthy with repetitive info?",False
5,10,Unmissable,benwashington-73360,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fascinating and terrifying story superbly told. A must watch.With the popularity of true crime documentary series over the last few years this is a unique story told in a way that keeps the viewer hooked throughout. Excellent and well directed interviews with the key actors in the story delicately presented.This series comes highly recommended to those in India and globally due to the dramatic story and unsettling details that will leave the viewer shocked.The editing, directing and production of the feature stands out and has nods to the directors past work which will please existing fans and attract many new ones.",False
6,10,SPINE CHILLING ...UNNERVING...HAUNTING,ambisai,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are incidents ...no matter how unrelated to your life and yet they leave an impact.They leave you with more questions than answers....more perplexed than resolve ; sense ceases to prevail only to haunt your mind and soul.This documentary just did that and more !But what's remarkable is the presentation which was absolutely fair. The director allowed you to step in everyone's shoe and build your own perspective.No biases , it simply unfolds the truth with heavy emotions !The ease and the way of gracefully presenting the story is dignified with zero sensationalism.But what moveD me most was the ONLY VOICE RECORDING PLAYED at the end of the series.It says it all .....it was like her life's end being sung by herself.As for the perpetrator ......8 judges gave their verdict and even the audience will say the same
MUST WATCH
Salute to the team for such a spectacular effort.",True
7,3,"Unengaging, unnecessary and useless details",arunavhrithik,n/a,16/08/2025,"Credit goes to the trailer maker who convinced me to watch this with his trailer design but the final product is a disappointment.First of all, the parallelization of the stories doesn't blend in as it seems they had no clue how to tell the story.Same thing repeated again and again. The talkers talking about the same thing doesn't giving any new details. Nothing new for the next episodes. After the first 15 minutes of the opening episode the documentary lost it's engagement.Unnecessary back stories, to relate with the characters they have tried to establish back stories, which was filled with unnecessary details that failed to maintain the connection with the characters.In short, if you want to know about the case you can do some digging on youtube no need to waste your time watching this.",False
8,10,Intriguing addition to the true-crime doc genre,josharrowsmith-18364,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is an extremely gripping documentary about the mysterious disappearance, grisly murder and sad discovery of Shakereh Khaleeli, if you are familiar with the story or not and an intriguing addition to the true-crime documentary gener. Fans of true-crime documentaries will be more than satsified with the content, as will new-comers to the genre.The four 30-minute episodes are well-paced and suspenseful. The fascinating interviews with officials and relatives as well as the photographs are all beautifully shot.Actual interviews with Shradhananda from inside the prison are a definite highlight.",True
9,1,Plain boring!!!!,manishguptagkp,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series' is of four episodes . Each of half hour long. This could have been easily a two episodes series because there was nothing in the story. No suspense no twist nothing.A guy murders his wife because he will inherit the property after she is dead and he gets arrested after three year. Nothing more to say in the story.You see crime happening due to property or some dispute . This series is same nothing special. You cry out loud and wait and wait and wait for twist or suspense but there is nothing for you. At the end i would suggest you to watch ""the burari case"" on Netflix or the Indian predator.",False
10,9,Well done,hazangel-89910,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was well done in my opinion. I cant agree with others who said it was boring. What do people want? Explosions? Shootings? Fighting? I thought it was a thought provoking account of a tragedy that happened over 20 years ago. Of course I had not heard of this ""crime"" before.The biggest problem is it is difficult to believe the authorities. It is conceivable that they accept bribes from family or friends of the victim. Prior to watching the 3rd episode I truly believe that this little man killed his wife. Now I am not so sure. Unless I can physically see the evidence of her scratch marks in the coffin, or that he gave her the sleeping pills, it really is hard to prove. Of course burying her was awful but it does not mean he killed her. He could be charged with tampering with a body. He did seem to love her and she looked happy in pictures. On a side note, Shakereh's mother and daughter are gorgeous as was Shakerah.There also may be an element of the caste system at play. He was a darker, homely looking man with not much money (it seems). She was, for a lack of a better word, royalty. Who knows. Maybe the husband has me fooled.",False
11,10,Truth Revealing,posttoricha,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great as viewers will come to know that how a middle class man will be set in the trap by wealthy family. Rich can perform more heinous crimes. Even after three years where were her mother, husband and daughters. Why misra needed to put her in wooden box as the length of the hole is so vast that it could be done without wooden box. Rich people killed her daughter with the help of maid of workers and if fear as misra was already fighting seven cases filled , in fear he performed her last ritual and that is taken advantage by rich people. If they were so lovable why were not leaving their own daughter to live peacefully. Why she was highly angry on them as she made him power of attorney. No question against their family members. One sided game were going on against mishra. Why he put in jail when Manu Sharma is out.",False
12,3,Least interesting of all crime documentaries I have seen so far,Biswas_,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA lot of the things were given away in the trailer. For many, this incident is still rather unknown because it happened in the 90s. Hence , it would have been good if the trailer kept facts like a coffin under the floor as a secret so that it came as a shocker for the unversed. Sadly from the trailer I came to know almost everything about the incident.The series takes a good 35 mins or so to explain the family of Sehere and how she got to know Swami and their relationship. It is important for us to know them well to understand why the murder took place but then when you really come to know why the murder took place , you will feel that you were fed with a lot more than needed information and it made the series a bit boring.The chilling part comes when the body is unearthed. The reason why it's chilling because it's a real life footage . Anyone not comfortable watching dead bodies and stuff will be chilled to the bone watching . Then comes the part where the culprit gives his opinion and that part too I felt was really boring because it was again all talks about love and life and blablabla.Finally it left me pretty confused at the end as many facts and figures are shown but none are utilised properly or reach a proper conclusion. Like the culprit claims he did not kill but during the court session we never get to hear this angle , and if it was presented, then what was shown to prove that the culprit was lying ? In fact once the culprit even claimed himself that he killed. The case seemed very confusing to me .The reason why something like a House of Burari was way more interesting and disturbing was not only was the incident something shocking and unique but the backstory also packed in a really chilling story . I know not all cases are like this but Dancing on the Grave case doesn't pack in the most interesting case I have seen , it , at the end felt like a Savdhan India episode .Overall, you may be chilled by watching this if you are new to witnessing such cases but if you have seen such documentaries before , you might be bored and unchilled like me . But one things for sure that such incidents do disturb me a lot that such people exist in our society from whom we need to careful.",True
13,4,Confusing at times but most importantly they made a huge mistake,SaraMKay,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA documentary about a heinous and gruesome murder.The storytelling is confusing at times.But we get this picture: A beloved mother of four daughters was murdered. She was a stunningly beautiful woman from an ancient, most established, very old money family, who married very young and had four beautiful daughters with her husband who was a very successful politician, a diplomat, from whom she later divorced, because ultimately she was unhappy in her marriage. They claim all sorts of obviously stereotypical reasons why she wanted the divorce. I wonder why nobody could or would tell HER story, HER reasons, HER state of mind. So, basically we don't know anything about the woman Shakereh.She met a rather mysterious character (wrong description, as we will learn later, though) in a man and somehow all of a sudden integrated him into her family, almost during the divorce from her first husband. By the way we also learn little to nothing about him either.The story takes a turn because then Shakereh vanishes from the face of the earth. No family member could get in contact with her and the now second husband, as is revealed, claims all sorts of reasons why that is, that they couldn't get a hold of Shakereh. He's a story teller. But after quite some time the police eventually gets involved, and then after some more time, because the police is really struggling somehow with the disappearance and most of all with the question, if this second husband might be involved at all, but luckily the housekeeper witnessed him perform some kind of religious ceremony and the detective was familiar with this religion and confident that ritual must have been held over a grave site traditionally, so they finally manage to bring the man to the station for an interrogation.Very quickly he folds and tells the story of her heinous, gruesome, and as we all know, most unnecessary cruel and vicious murder.This man had a plan. He tells they argued a lot and he couldn't take it anymore, bought plywood for a body-sized, makeshift coffin, drugged Shakereh with a sedative laced cup of tea he served her ""with a smile"", went to lunch and when he returned, she was out, ""still sleeping"" is what he claimed. He put her into the coffin including the bedding and all, wrapped her nicely, face down, dragged her out in the back yard and buried her ""with a slight downward angle"", alive.The absolute worst thing a documentary of that kind could ever do follows the ""confession"" at the police station:
They sit the man down and dare to let him tell ""his side of the story"" aka ""the truth"". We know every single word is a lie.I can't get into details about his confabulations and lies. Please watch if you're interested, but keep in mind, it's a four part documentary drama series, that will probably or most certainly leave you confused and infuriated about this crime, that seems to be committed so nonchalantly and by the way, so ""she made me do it"", so ""she wanted me so bad, if I had had a say, I would have rather married a virgin, but she made me do it"", and all that femicidle victim blaming, shaming (I can't believe they really let him say all these nasty things about her and put it on film), scheming, that can make someone physically sick to sit through.Do we really learn something? About the people involved - no.In part three, religion is mentioned merely as a sidenote. The man appeared from nowhere and literally infested every part of Shakereh's life in no time) This sick, pathetic individual was given way too much time to explain away the absolute horrors he committed and even give him the time of day to make himself out as the real victim and hero of his story at the same time.It should have been HER story, Shakereh's heartbreakingly sad and untimely ending. She had four beautiful daughters and a loving family.",True
14,1,Dancing on grave by her 1st Family,faithronak,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBy the documentary,
1st
It is right that he & other servants buried dead female. Female was dead by overdose of sleeping pills by own. She used to drink. So, it is possible that dead by own hand like accidental suicide.2nd
Biggest mistake of Mr. Murli that he hide death of her own wife. He must admitted or informed that muslim inspector. Result may be different.3rd
Mr. Murli convicted by hide death of her wife. Not murdered. & Indian judgement?4th
Whole siya muslim family proved lie in front of camera over property. They admitted on camera. So, them must be also jail for life in imprisonment.5th
Only one daughter fighting for her mother. Other three daughters & 1st husband hates victim. So, it proves that 1st muslim family is disrespectful & disgrace for society.6th
1st marriage was completely failure. 2nd marriage was successful. That's why she married second time. She drink, wear modern cloth, cigar, etc. Which is not allow in siya muslim. So, she was modern woman & follow in humanity. Muslim family just lie for it.7th
1st muslim family tortured her. Even by her own mother. So, they inspired her for suicide.8th
Police is proved culprits. They have no evidences. They have not proper investigation. They tortured victim. So, court must show it base less investigation by siya muslim inspector. They showed religion angel.9th
It is not proved that Mr. Murli was culprit or innocent. So, he must be free. & Her family must sentenced by court for tortured her. For that document is available.Media is idiots bcaz they performed judge role.Rest in peace, madam.Your 1st family don't understand u. & U was accidentally death by them. The idiot 2nd husband framed of your murder.",True

1,5,Confused a bit.,BDeuceR,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst off, thank you Lisa Velez for sharing your journey with us(highs and lows) and I am glad you beat cancer! Watching this movie has me confused a bit. I remember a lot of the songs and watching this movie has me wondering about Full Force. I think like 90% of the music was produced and Featured them but I didn't see them at all in this movie. There has to be some homage there because they definitely helped her success. Don't get me wrong Lisa Velez is a talent but you can't leave out Full Force as they were involved in most(if not all) of your biggest hits. Aside from that portion, I think it's a good movie to watch and it does bring some Nostalgia. Thanks Again Lisa.",True
2,1,Irrelevant,whatisbecky,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen I saw commercials for this, I'm like: who is this? Went and looked up songs, oh, ""head to toe"", I like that.This movie is boring. She makes it as a singer, extremely easy. She was only 15, went to a club, sang backstage for a guy, guy hooks her up at a studio then she signs a contract. Such a hard struggle lol. She makes a few hits and tours. She married her boyfriend though she is never home. She gets an abortion because all she wants to do is sing, selfish. Because that increases cancer risk, she gets the breast cancer and instead of being a mom, she goes through chemo while on tour.Not too much drama with the band. Background singer, Toni, over steps her bounds. She is also into what looks like coke, which was popular in the 80s.Lisa gets assaulted, maybe almost raped but that never gets discussed and is forgotten.Lisa disrespects her manager, who brought her and the band brief fame. She gets in his face to say ""watch me"" and walks off to be independent. Yet they barely made music after this, least not the hits as before. Bad move.Not sure why Lifetime did this story. Lisa is selfish and irrelevant. So many other singers were more interesting from the 80's such as Lifetime's Janet documentary.",True

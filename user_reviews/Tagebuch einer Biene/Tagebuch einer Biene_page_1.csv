1,8,To Bee or not to ...,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ok sorry for the pun. I can only hope that with a documentary like that, people will understand how important bees are. So yes ""to bee"" - a strong resounding yes that is.This may be aimed more at kids or those who can still watch something and experience it like a wonder. And the work bees are doing ... the way they behave, as unit, as a group .. all working for a common goal. It is something that at best of times may apply to humans too.With bees it is like that all the time. And that all even though they are being misstreated and kind of not being taken seriously for a long period of time. Hopefully that will change - with the documentary and with what everyone is saying. Busy bees indeed ...",False

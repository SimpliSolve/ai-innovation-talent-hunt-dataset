1,8,Used up,leelou606,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew nothing about this pair when I first started watching this documentary, I just liked ice skating and thought I'd give it a shot. Ultimately by the end I was absolutely heartbroken for them both. Let down and failed by the adults that should have been supporting them, they were used up and tossed away. The families were left holding the pieces together, and ultimately they didn't receive the support they needed either.These kids, and their families deserved so much better. Katya deserved so much better.I just hope that a lot has changed since this pair were in the spotlight, but I'm guessing it really hasn't.",False
2,7,Skating on Thin Ice,Lejink,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have to confess, somewhat to my discredit, that I was completely unaware of this real-life sporting tragedy before I watched this feature-length documentary. I suspected a dark ending in advance but must admit, when it was eventually revealed, it still came as something of a shock.It's the story of two talented, aspirational teenagers from completely different parts of the world, who coincidentally come together to share their mutual ambition to compete at the highest level in pairs ice-skating. He's Harley, Australian and when he meets her, 19 years of age. He has Aboriginal heritage and comes from what you'd probably call a poorish working-class background with no family links at all to the sport. She's Katya, Russian and only 16 years old but if anything she's even more ambitious than him. It's important to say there appears at no time to have been any romantic involvement between the two.Paired together with a top Russian coach, they settle in Australia and quickly achieve early success in junior competitions and are thrust into adult meets, all the time aiming for the Winter Olympics, which they manage to achieve, probably before they're really ready. She then loses her father when he dies suddenly and now thousands of miles from any kind of family support, it's no surprise when she struggles with homesickness and loneliness, not to mention poverty as she's forced by circumstances to live in her coach's house, giving her no respite from the sport. Unsurprisingly, she develops mental health issues, turning to drink and reportedly a reckless lifestyle, sadly culminating in the shocking conclusion.Told frankly by those who knew her, with many contributions from recordings available of her own voice, this is a sad tale of young talent being pushed too far with little thought about supporting her psychological state. We've recently seen examples of other top sportsmen, athletes and gymnasts (Naomi Osaka and Simone Biles immediately spring to mind) withdrawing from competition citing symptoms of stress and it's a pity to think that young Katya was too far down the food chain to qualify for any kind of medical or financial support.As regards the telling of her story, I found it a little tricksy and flashy at times, unsuited for the seriousness of the subject matter, with overuse of jump cuts, overlapping speech and trivially putting up a kitchen notice board to indicate the couple's changing coaches as their career progresses. I also felt it could have looked more into the circumstances of Katya's demise, with no coverage of her funeral or of the investigation into how exactly she fell to her death. I did like her partner, Harley, a candid, down-to-earth Aussie, trying to go on with his career after enduring this heartbreak.A cautionary tale of thwarted and possibly even exploited young sporting ambition leading to disillusionment, depression and worse, one suspects it won't be the last story of its kind to come to light in the future.",False
3,7,Fire and Ice,glynmaclean,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler9 feet above ice as hard as concrete a delicate and fragile Russian athlete defies gravity. She is protected only by the talent of an aboriginal boy with the strength of a man. Yet men cannot always defy gravity and the fragile fall. A fairy tale story that bridges cultures and traditions older than civilisation itself. To master the elegance of ballet on ice is the pinnacle of mastering oneself. Guided by Andre a perfectionist Russian coach who deftly guides the young athletes to learn the principles of relentless, unforgiving work. Harley speaks no Russian. Katya speaks no English. The language they share is to move elegantly across thin ice. Katya emigrates to Australia to train and represent Australia. Discovered by a selector, the pair are developed and supported to enter competitions and win a youth grand Prix and a Gold medal for Australia. The language barrier dispels all the usual quarrels between artisans, who learn to trust and respect each other's work. Harley the calm gentleman and Katya the firebrand. He teaches her calmness. She teaches him perfectionism. A Russian Olympic coach tells Moscow ""I told you they would be good."" Moscow vows never to let Russian talent represent other countries again. They win! Russian coaching methods work for Harley who likes to be pushed and held accountable, but grates against the freedom of Katya. Events flow into the Olympics. Katya becomes an Australian citizen. The first Australian indigenous winter Olympian, Harley is paraded like a mascot for multi culturalism by politicians who all but take credit for his work. Katya barely speaks English and without the support of translators is sidelined by media. They do OK at the winter Olympics considering their young age. Katya starts to have mild seizures and headaches. Falls are commonplace in pairs training. A rift forms between Katya and coach Andre. Coaching moves to Montreal, Canada. Training conditions are impoverished. Unsupported, they struggle. Katya drinks alcohol, which teenager doesn't! Wine in the water bottle? Not a way to hydrate. Help was needed. Too little thought and consideration had been given to Katya's emotional well-being. Rather than support increasing, funding is reduced. Despite the heartbreaking lack of support, they do well in Las Vegas. Katya is diagnosed with epilepsy. Alcohol is a contributing factor. Katya is advised that she can no longer compete. Had someone understood the emotional impacts of losing a father as a young teen, the need to go home, to be with her mother. The support just wasn't there. Katya is found dead. Fallen from a sixth-floor window in Moscow. Harley is devastated. It doesn't seem real. How could this have happened? The undercurrent narrative is one of neglect in the care for the well-being of young athletes. That we may lose what we hold most dearly beautiful if we become ugly in our neglect. We end our journey acknowledging the journalists who challenged the sports organisations neglect for the humanity of children. Their work has led to a national, integrity framework to provide a safe, fair and healthy environment for participants at all levels of sport. We remember Katya as a lesson to care.",True
4,7,A moment of reflection,MickyG333,n/a,16/08/2025,"7.0 stars.As I meander through this very very sad documentary, I can only think to myself: what a crying shame. We take the lives of spectacular athletes for granted. These are people.Katya had a lot of pressure in her life and apparently it was too much to handle. Add to this the fact that she had multiple organ problems and possibly alcohol induced epilepsy? From what I've read, alcohol induced epilepsy is just another way of saying: severe alcoholism. The way that she died... How she was alone in a cold place in a cold country, where she might have been under-appreciated... I've said this before, I repeat it: so many great athletes, politicians, celebrities, heroes, have died lonely and disillusioned by what they thought was a medical comrade...""na-zda-roh-vye?"" Not so much.",False
5,10,The Sharp Edge Of Attitude,alephnullfidusachates,n/a,16/08/2025,I had a somewhat open mind without any high expectations about how this documentary would play out and I wasn't the slightest bit disappointed with the way it was painstakingly put together.It is an exceptional look into the raw toughness of two highly skilled individuals that come together from two sides of the world with differing cultural backgrounds for the resolute purpose of bonding their hard earned strengths to form a spectacular winning partnership.I found this documentary totally engaging in so many ways as it takes you through all the aspects necessary to make it to competition level and all the seesawing effects of winning and losing.But it was the visceral psychological effects that initially creep up slowly and then shatter so quickly that will chill you to the bone and pull at your heartstrings.This is worth a watch.,False
6,10,Devastatingly Brilliant,pik923,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love ice skating, I love the competitions, I love the couples and the dance partners. So I have a certain prejudice in loving this brilliantly crafted documentary film.Well researched, well investigated, delving into interviews, the life of young children who have a passion, a huge passion where their entire life is devoted to one thing.In this case it is a sport. And the drive, the ecstasy of the accomplishments met with the difficulties of the mistakes and failures, the learning curve.The idea that we don't take care of your children in their bountiful desire to express themselves be it in sport or art or or or - where funding is an issue and money an obstacle.I don't want to say anything more about this. I suggest if you don't know anything about their story - then just watch the film without too much pre-research.Bless those who helped Harley and Katya and who worked with them through the good times and difficult times.Bring a box of tissues to your screening.",False
7,10,Mesmerizingly Haunting,destiny_west,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary will not disappoint, even if you are not a fan of competitive ice skating.The narrative is strong and interviews are well done and included with amazing footage of the pair training and competing. It also gives you a wonderful insight into the world of competitive ice skating in Australia and the battles the athletes have emotionally, physically and financially.It is a wonderfully engaging documentary and I was fully captivated the whole time and sad to see it end.It is also devastatingly sad to know what Katya was going through and what she had went through in her pursuit of excellence.A definite must watch.",False
8,10,Excellent documentary ...left me speechless,moveebuff1953,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is always fun to watch a child who has such a passion in their field of choice, that they give it 100% effort.Two of these children who came from completely different backgrounds, not speaking each others language, could communicate solely with their love of figure skating.Harley, a sweet young indigenous boy from Australia is paired with a tiny Russian girl who is driven from a very young age to win. Both are willing to make skating their priority in life with hopes of winning an Olympic medal.I had worries about Katya leaving Russia and becoming an Australian citizen. Red flags flew up in my mind.Harley & Katya skated so beautifully together. It was wonderful to watch them skate at competitions.It is well known that as a Russian there are dire consequences for failure. Katya was well aware of that since her coach was constantly yelling at her to do better.'The result of Katya's decision to go back to Russia to perfect her skating along with Harley as her partner no doubt was an embarrassment to the Russians.Finding out that her health was failing to the point where she could no longer skate, was, in my opinion the final nail in the coffin for her.Russians are brutal and when they are unhappy with you because you have shamed the motherland, and suddenly fall out of a window, I find it hard to believe that she took her own life.I wonder if anyone will agree with my suspicions.",True
9,8,"""Harley & Katya"" a Documentary that is Sheer Poetry in Motion",AntonyCirocco001,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Harley & Katya"" by Selina Miles is a feature-length documentary. It's a well-funded documentary (by Australian standards). It's a sports documentary on the surface, but it goes much further than that; it goes deep into the world of figure skating and into the culture of competition surrounding the sport.Harley, from Blacktown in Sydney, is struggling to find a matched partner; his Russian-born coaches, experts in figure skating, find him a good fit, Katya. What follows is a journey that leads to Russia and around the world as the two of them, Harley and Katya climb the world rankings.Both Harley and Katya knew nothing about each other's homelands, and when Katya decides to come to Australia to train, she is not sure if it is Austria or Australia. This is not a love story, but you will most likely fall in love with Harley and Katya, who quickly become a figure skating powerhouse.Want to read more, google - ""perspective documentary reviews""",False
10,8,Rise and Fall,ronysallam,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA heartaching documentary revealing the back story behind the life of young Olympic ice skating athletes.Katya's story broke my heart.Her Life was not for vain since she was the reason that the ISU made the Katya Law .I can't imagine the psychological, emotional and mental stresses she had to endure at very young age as well as the language barrier.She was very talented, an innate beauty on her performance... May her soul rest in peace.The story of the pair Harley and Katya represent the rise and fall of a tragic story.Never thought that all these beautiful performances that I watch on TV held so many painful and hard moments for players.",True
11,3,Netflix crysploitatiion at its worst,the_real_Doc_Justice,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNo soul in there. I feel sorry for the lady's demise of course, but the shows sole purpose is exploitation it. I don't see any service to her memory.Some people might learn that figure skaters are exploited and milked money out of, and for these people, I am really glad they learned something out of it.I am angry that I got pulled into watching this. It's not a competition about the worst fate, but... The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez is something I learned from.This is not crime drama this is just... Drama. This is like, ""ain't it some other news item I can draw money from?""Take your chance.",True

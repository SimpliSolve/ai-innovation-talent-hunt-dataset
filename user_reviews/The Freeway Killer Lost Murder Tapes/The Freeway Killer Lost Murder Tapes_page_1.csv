1,8,Well made .,sylvaingnostic,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just saw this documentary and i thought it looked like most good real crime out there .The fact that i have never heard of this psychopath made me interested and facinated .The back story on him was pretty sad and in those days resources were quite limited . The editing was pretty good , sound was perfect , clips used were good quality , the audio recording of the interview are good quatity but you dont hear much of it ...but a few bits here and there .One thing i would like in those kinds of documentaries is more graphic (maybe with a warning) , but more graphic pictures of the victims and the coroners pictures to see the scene and wounds .Overall this was a very good watch and i liked it because it kept me interested .My score is 8/10 ...editing was good because it was well researched . Interviews with detectives and other parties was good .",False
2,10,one of the...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Forgotten serial killers of the 70's and 80's, william bonin, the freeway killer of california, more or less bound to 4 counties in the l.a. Area. Luring young teenage kids into his van, sexually molesting, torturing and killing at least 21 in a record short timeline, attacking gender confused boys and streetboys, living out his psycho/sosio.pathic view against/toward homosexuals. A complex criminal figure, where extremely lot of material were confidetialized, due to several reasons, how he got caught were just a shot of luck.I do really wonder why they made a film about this caracter, cause there mustve been material for at least a 6 hour docu series in these tapes and interviews. I think that wouldve been a deed of replanishment from the justice department towards the lgbtq+ society to reveal what he did to their gender brothers. But at least a very well sewn together real crime documentary, loads of old pictorial and news media reels of historic value, and the motto must be... dont hitch hike whatever reason...even a grumpy old man knows that. A must see for the TC geeks.",False
3,3,Not One of the Better Docs,arfdawg-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've seen a few of these sort of serial killer documentaries, including another series that included the freeway killer. It was way better than this one.The 70's and 80's saw a whole hell of a lot of serial killers in Los Angeles. Who knows what was going on back then, but there sure were a lot of killers dumping bodies all over the place.This doc just doesnt connect. It basically goes like this: Murder. Play some tapes of the killer talking about it. Interview an expert. Repeat.It's so repetitive that you get bored early on. I just didnt feel it was very well done.And where's the incite about why there were so many serial killers around this time?",False

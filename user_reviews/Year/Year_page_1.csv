1,10,War in the 21st century,vovikstudio,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very strong documentary that shows the horrors of the war in Ukraine, which was unleashed by russia.Yes, the film cannot show all the pain that Ukrainians experience every day. Until February 24, many could not believe that this could happen in the 21st century, but the war came to one of the largest countries in Europe.But Ukrainians are a very strong people who can withstand this war. Ukrainian brave warriors bravely defend their lands from evil.I highly recommend watching it to viewers from other countries to understand that it is not somewhere far away, but very close. The whole world should see this film.",False

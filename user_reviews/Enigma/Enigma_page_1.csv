1,6,"Identity, pioneers, and impact",peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.I have respect for trans filmmakers being able to create projects to tell stories about identity and self through their perspectives, especially with how the current state and politics are in the world. Filmmaker and activist Zackary Drucker tells the story of two icons April Ashley and Amanda Lear and despite some flawed structures, it remains a insightful and engaging observations about the two icons, their impact, and what made them special and important to the LGBTQ community.Drucker is able to get into both of the two individuals personalities and what made them famous. With good discussions, uses of music, and style of editing, it does a good work on telling this story. Especially on the in-depth scales. I won't say it's perfect as certain aspects does run the well dry. But as a whole, I really appreciate what Drucker is going for.I highly recommend her work on ""The Stroll (2023)"" if you like this one.",False
2,10,Loved every minute of it!,imdbfan-3768615130,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI am so shocked by how robust the trans culture in France was in the 1950s. The documentary painted a vivid picture of the lives of many transgender women in Paris. We will get some additional storylines as well which were only a cherry on top of this beautifully crafted documentary.April Ashley's story is breathtaking. The hatred, disdain, and setbacks she had to face due to the regressive society of that time are terribly tragic. However, it is truly remarkable and important that she never changed her story. She stayed true to herself and stood proudly, owning her identity and narrative. This, unfortunately, became her downfall during certain periods of her life-especially when her husband (who later turned out to be a transvestite himself) betrayed her, and when Amanda Lear stabbed her in the back by pretending she had nothing to do with April.Amanda Lear is clearly lying. I'm not sure whether it's due to the influence of Dali (who even mentioned that only an idiot tells the truth-intelligent people never do), and perhaps that's the rope Amanda is clinging to: if Dali did it this way, why shouldn't she? It might also be because she saw how the media and public dragged April through the mud from the very moment she was outed as trans. So, it's quite understandable why Amanda kept denying her transgender identity-she didn't want to end up like April.I laughed so many times when Amanda was asked questions about her past connected to the Parisian nightclub, which was a hotspot for trans girls. She just kept saying she had no idea what was being talked about-it was hilarious. Meanwhile, we see official documents inserted into the film showing that April was a witness at Amanda's wedding, which was only arranged to obtain citizenship and a new passport. Amanda even refuses to reveal her name before the marriage or her parents' surnames, claiming she doesn't remember any of them. Everything we see in the documentary (and I must add that the team did an excellent job researching the archives) points to the conclusion that Amanda is trans and has been hiding it from the public since the beginning of her stardom. In fact, she's basically confessing through denial and evasion. The epitome of this is when she talks about how different and difficult it was to be trans at that time-how people often looked down on transgender people and were very hostile towards them.The closing line is quite heavy: ""It must be very lonely at the top."" We hear the line as we come to terms with Amanda's decision, while also recognizing the consequences that a life built on secrecy brings-being alone, with no family or friends who truly know the truth about her. But this is the price she paid for fame. Everyone must decide for themselves whether it was worth it.I have to add that the trans girls looked so beautiful and were so sophisticated. It was jaw-dropping to see, really.All in all, this was a truly remarkable documentary and I am sure I will come back and re-watch it from time to time.",True
3,10,Just wow!,brooksrodrigue-63334,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a great documentary! It was the story of Ashley April and Amanda Lear. I was not familiar with their stories until this documentary but know since watching this, I've fallen down the rabbit hole trying to find out even more about them. Enigma tells the story of these two trans women who both started out at the same drag club in the late 40's and '50's in Paris called the Carousel. This aspect was interesting to me as well. I didn't know much about what it was like in France for. Trans person at this time. It was interesting how it was still illegal in France as in America at the time yet at the same time the Carousel considered the coolest club in all of France. The film's focus was although two women started out as performers, both be accepted as women and have a how that led them down two very different paths!Loved this documentary! Need more like it!",False
4,n/a,And Amanda Lear investigation disguised as a documentary,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't understand why the interviewer tried so hard to make Amanda Lear « come out » as trans when she clearly, since the 60's, denied that she's a transwoman. And even if that's the case, isn't trans people has the right to leave the past behind and « reborn » as the person they truly are.It totally make the doc gross and tabloid like. Especially the end when Zackary Drucker was pushing the insinuation.The part about April Ashley was way more intersting, it would have been nice to have more about Marie-Pierre and maybe other icons from that era like Coccinelle, the one who did everything before everyone else.",False
5,10,Excellent documentary,info-51929,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerWell researched and brilliantly put together. Fascinating stories of the trans milieu in the 50's and 60's in light of the persecution trans peoples suffer today. April Ashley is by far the more magnetic story compared to the phony and laughable Amanda Lear who has re-invented herself (she can't even remember her family name) and who seemingly has betrayed everyone who knew her before and after her transition.April Ashley comes off as the true heroine of this engrossing history.,True

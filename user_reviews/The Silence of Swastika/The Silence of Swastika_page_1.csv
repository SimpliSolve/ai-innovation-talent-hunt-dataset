1,10,A documentary make you free from prejudices,EditorVinodSingh,n/a,16/08/2025,The documentary brings out hidden truth lying underground for years purposefully.Some of the information is quite surprising and make us think how a whole bunch of lies and fake materials were promoted to a whole generation to defame one culture to safeguard another.A must watch for everyone.,False

3,10,Simply a masterpiece no one should miss,ayushspgdmg,n/a,16/08/2025,"If I say it is one of the best documentaries made in the history of modern India, it won't be even a slightest exaggeration. Given the fact that it was the debut film for the director with no background in movie making, they did a marvellous job! One can clearly see through the amount of gruelling effort that has been put in this project. It's one of the very few documentaries that gives an edge of the seat experience. Watch it at all costs(though there is no cost, it's totally free on YouTube). The best we could do is to share it with our friends and make as many people watch it as possible.",False

5,10,LITERALLY MIND-BLOWING AND EYE-OPENING!,ts-85601,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a professional, well-made, and eye-opening documentary that every Indian should watch. How did the symbol of peace and prosperity become evil and repulsive in the eyes of the world? Therein lies the greatest betrayal of the 20th century. Hold onto your seats because the storm is coming.",False
6,10,Naked truth,ajaysinghaks-21144,n/a,16/08/2025,Before this documentary I don't know this fact that the hitler doesn't used swastik he used a Christion Cross. This documentary opens the real truth in front of world and breaked a ongoing propaganda against swastika.,False

9,10,Eye opening documentary which every Indian should watch,nishantingle-79371,n/a,16/08/2025,Today's generation is fed with so much news that it becomes hard for them to differentiate between truth and lies. But even hammering of fake news turns into belief. And as we all know history is written by the winners.This film tries to explore the parts which were intentionally tampered by the so called historians and shows them as raw as possible.You won't have a single question on the connection between Hitler & Swastik once you watch this to the end.,False

11,10,Very Educational Documentary Film,TheNonSmoker,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very well researched and very well-made documentary, this 50 min film briefly specifies the difference between Swastika and Hakenkreuz (Hooked Christian Cross)
A must-watch for everyone, for me this was quite eye-opening.",False
12,2,Where is the research ?,gwvkecsau,n/a,16/08/2025,"While the production quality is indeed good. The research is rudimentary. 99% of this stuff can be googled. There is no academic weightage, these guys went and spoke to a bunch of youtubers and few recent folks in news and thats it.I guess most of the money was spent to buy equipment and travel tickets.I would suggest do some research proper credible research. Talk to real historians, talking to shambhav sharma means nothing.",False
13,10,Superb and well research project,kanabarchand,n/a,16/08/2025,"Truly mind-blowing project, well researched and knowledge enhancing work, big fan of you two brothers congratulations in advance for the success of your upcoming project keep it up.",False
14,9,Great documentary,rayjay_90,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is really great; well written, research is good, well edited. All and all helps to awaken the Hindu society about how swastika has been wrongfully used instead of hooked cross.",False
15,10,The Truth Has Been Told..... The World Needs to Listen Now,jay-techie2007,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mind-blowing research and a very well made documentary. If someone doesn't know, they would never be able to figure that this is AKTK's first documentary. The kind of content that can put big studios to shame.While I have known a lot about the history of Swastika and Hakenkreuz through various sources, there is a lot more new information that AKTK has disclosed is this one.I hope they soon come up with the English version of the documentary since the non-Hindu audience, especially the White Westerners, need to know and acknowledge this.Definitely to be watched.",False
16,10,Well Researched,mangeshsingh-19858,n/a,16/08/2025,Well Researched documentary by any Indian for the cause of misinterpretation of Hindu faith and symbols. Very good sound effect and drone shots. The sue of historical images and footage make it more catchy and gloomy.,False
17,10,To set the records straight and hold the truth upright.,vatsprnjl,n/a,16/08/2025,It's worth watching and even more important to learn from it. One must understand the whole spectrum of truth and see the facts unfold right in front of the eyes which were hiding in the plane sight or maybe which were deliberately kept in a box of lies to make a community look guilty of something they have nothing to do with.It's a brilliantly made documentary with a lot of heart and passion and truth and hence I am sure will resonate with u just like it did with me. It has the right amount of sensationalism and a whole lot of facts staright from the books and actual speeches of the leaders. Production quality is brilliant and so is the research.I am so impressed with the team who made it possible and wouldn't shy away from stating that it's borderline inspirational.,False
18,10,West world needs to see this and open their eyes,rohansanwal,n/a,16/08/2025,A must watch for all who wants to understand the Swastik symbol. High time world needs to understand that Indian swastik is not what they think it is. It's a symbol of happiness and peace.,False

23,10,Get literate west!,shubhamde,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a classic example of how a documentary should be made. The facts may sound bitter to west but that's the truth. Talking about the way of presentation, it's outstanding! It doesn't feel that this is the first time AKTK produced a documentary. They were very professional with their work. A must watch if you are seeking for the truth behind our beloved Sanatani Swastik and how It's reputation and values were ruined by Western media.",False
24,10,Tells how western historians have maligned symbol of sanatan Dharma to hide the crimes conducted in name of christianity and in their dark times,abhinavmamc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Swastika was a hindu symbol. The Hitler symbol was "" Hooked cross"" translated from the German word ""Haugenkraus"". THe European historians in order to hide he crimes down in name of church deliberately mistranslated the word to "" Swastika"" which looked similar but is totally different and represents high values of santan Dharma where principles of war is based on principles and rules of Dharma as per Gita and Ramayana. This lies of Hindu history is well exposed now.",False

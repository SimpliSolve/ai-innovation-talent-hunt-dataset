1,10,For those who didn't like the movie because of its second half,mysticfall,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year.",True
2,10,One of the best films of this decade,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.
Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there.",False
3,8,"You name a genre, this movie covers it",jtindahouse,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too.",False
4,10,Meritocracy: it's metaphorical,nehpetstephen,n/a,15/08/2025,"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.",False

6,9,An original dark comedy about class struggles,impeyrules-54634,n/a,15/08/2025,This is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.,False
7,10,Great,0U,n/a,15/08/2025,The most original film of 2019 and it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie in quite a while. Class warfare at its best.,False
8,n/a,"Engaging as a drama, with an intelligent social aspect to it",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don't see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative.",False

10,9,Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us,DJKwa,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride.",False
11,6,I'm baffled by the over the top praise.,dacorn-00765,n/a,15/08/2025,"The film is interesting, but that's about it. The first hour was really slow, the whole class thing seemed quite familiar. I'm not sure why people are falling over themselves about this film, maybe since it was Korean yet with an accessible story and familiar film language that it suddenly moved westerners to 'see the light'? Anyway, the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line I would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives. Overall, I'm more critical of the critics than of the film. I recommend seeing this, it's worth a look but all the Oscars and 'best film of the decade' stuff is incomprehensible.",False
12,10,Thoroughly entertaining,Leofwine_draca,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerPARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a talent I've long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think.",True
13,6,simple opinion without any spoilers,Haneenho,n/a,15/08/2025,"1.This movie is too over rated, I don't know, maybe it is something wrong with me because so many people appreciates this film superlatively...2. All the characters are pathetically unlikable. They only show flaws. You don't want to be them; you don't want to be with them ... not at the beginning, nor in the middle, nor in the end.3. This lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.4. I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately.",False

It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life.

16,10,One of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen,tmcapitals,n/a,15/08/2025,"Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite.
Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that.
The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations.",False
17,9,Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea,perica-43151,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie.",False

Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.Kim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes.",True

20,8,A black comedy on social inequality,CineMuseFilms,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThere is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance.",True
21,9,Whose the parasite and whose the cow?!,dougal79,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and the upper class.
You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too!
There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an ""idyllic"" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!",False
22,6,"Fine, but Overrated.",euplay1220,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film doesn't allow easy reviewing because it has many aspects, many ways to look at. Is it thriller? Comedy? Drama? Societal critique? It's all of it; and therefore none of it. All in all, I was underwhelmed and mildly frustrated.The style is there, I grant it. Cinematography is great. Acting is awkward at some points, but it's OK because of the partially comedy-like nature of this film.But then, there is a problem with story telling. It builds up nicely toward the middle, where the parasites settle in their host and discover the secret down below. And then it makes an unexpected turn. It's alright to make a surprise at the end (I'd even say it's good), as long as it flows reasonably from the preceding story line. A reveal must make sense once it is revealed. This one didn't do the job convincingly for me. We are given very little clue about why people acted the way they did at the birthday party.This film is just fine, but no masterpiece in my opinion. Some films are so easy to understand to the point of being insulting; others are so obscure to the point of being pointless. Great films do it just right somewhere in this spectrum.

11/11/19I've seen Parasite three times in five days. I think something may be wrong with me. It's just so good, even after repeat viewings the high-tension scenes still hold so many thrills. Bong Joon-ho has made a perfect film. I've seen it so many times I've memorized the characters lines so I can watch them almost the entire time without having to read the subtitles, this made the movie even more enjoyable. I just wanted to write some aimless thoughts about the movie, pretty much conversing with myself here, but feel free to read. Oh, and we definitely get to major spoilers so avoid this if you haven't seen the movie.Yeo-jeong Jo, the performer who plays Mrs. Park is such a gem. Her hysteria and earnest simplicity make her a joy to watch. Her face is so expressive and bright, there is a scene where she is walking up a flight of stairs and is witnessing her maid have a pretty disgusting coughing fit and the look of sheer disgust and revulsion on her face is so hilarious. She is the introductory cornerstone to the relatability and identifiable nature of the ultra-rich Park family.My favorite character is still Mr. Kim played by regular Bong hitter Kang-ho Song. The way Bong directs his performers seems to be relaxed as he's said Song would do multiple takes and each performance would be wildly different until he settled into what they felt was right. This proved to be a real challenge for editor Jinmo Yang, who would have to composite different takes into each other to make them work. For example, Song may have had an over the top take, but Jo may have had her best take of that same scene. Yang would digitally edit the scene to meld them and get the best performances from both actors. It's seamless to us, but to Yang that's a lot of pressure. Personally, this was cool to learn because we recently had to do this on a short film I worked on, good to know larger productions do this too. It's fascinating to watch Parasite with that in mind because Song's Mr. Kim is such an eccentric character and watching the other actors react to him is a treat. He's the least predictable of the entire family and seeing his various reactions and how he absorbs what's going on around him is captivating. During this screening I really took in his expressions and his motives for the actions he takes at the end of the film. They really clicked and made sense to me this time around. The way Song processes pain in his face is deftly subtle and minute.That pain we see paints a much larger dark mark across the underlying themes of the film. The title Parasite doesn't take a genius to decode. The poverty-stricken Kim family is very much in a symbiosis with the Parks. The Kims are driving them around, tutoring their children, cleaning their house and cooking their meals while Mr. Park's salary alone pays all four members of the Kim family. Which is insane to think about, that distribution of wealth is ridiculous. There is a line from Mrs. Kim, she says Mrs. Park is nice because she is rich, and how if she were rich, she would be nice too. She also likens money to an iron, smoothing out the creases. Which is an apt analogy, sure we all have heard money cannot buy happiness and images of the sad billionaire conjure up in our minds. We can say that money doesn't buy happiness, but money does buy us breathing room, it sands the sharp edge of reality down. When you're broke and down and out, everything seems like a threat. It seems like one strong wind, or in the case of Parasite, one literal storm can obliterate any stability you might start to create or what little you had to begin with anyways.A beautiful, heavy rainstorm is admired from the top of the hill where the Parks live, only to completely flood and destroy the semi-basement where the Kim's live. All that gorgeous rainwater flows downhill from the mansions and directly into the slums, consuming the entire Kim apartment. The next morning in the car Mrs. Park is mindlessly chatting away on the phone saying how much of a blessing the rain was and how clean everything is, she also takes notice of her driver, Mr. Kim's, unpleasant smell. Unbeknownst to her, 8 hours previously he and his children were neck deep in flood water mixed with raw sewage trying to salvage family photographs and prized possessions, all of which fit in a single box. The most striking shot in the film is Mr. Kim's daughter calmly smoking a cigarette, perched on top of a toilet violently spewing black filth. Cut back to the luxury Mercedes, Mrs. Park rides in, pinching her nose and rolling down a window, only for Mr. Kim to almost lose it. His face deftly registers exhaustion, anger, jealousy, and pain, the emotions revolve around his face like clockwork. Parasite messes with perspectives of reality and how your wealth measures how close to reality you really are. Mrs. Park isn't a villain, her wealth just acts as a warm, protective blanket of ignorance to the suffering around her.The tragic comedy and irony of Parasite goes even deeper. As the ending events of the film lead to Ki-taek (Mr. Kim) going into hiding, while his son Ki-woo, and wife have both now caught legal reps. Ki-woo writes a letter his father will never receive. He vows to buy the mansion his father is hiding out in. The bitter reality has me asking what kind of opportunities will a person with no formal education, no trained skills, and a criminal record have? What shot will this kid get? The friends who joined me at the screening were hopeful for Ki-woo's future, I however was not as optimistic. Yet the most compelling element of Parasite is that with the world it creates we really don't know what the future may have in store for the Kim family. It's a self-contained, grounded yet fascinating and strange universe we get to inhabit for a two-hour segment, and a world I will continue to revisit many more times.",True
24,7,I don't get it,120watts,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was entertaining, with good execution. But best picture?Some people seem to love the fact that it switches masterfully between genres, which to me seems like something that would excite a movie geek or critic more than it would a regular viewer.Others delight in the ambiguity of not quite knowing whom to root for - while that might distinguish it from a stereotypical ""american"" narrative it hardly elevates it to some exalted status. To its credit, I think the strongest feature of the film is that the director brilliantly manipulates the viewer's emotions by superimposing classically sympathetic elements onto the objectively non-virtuous and indeed villainous. What seems relatable and sympathetic in the moment is actually part of a pattern of deeply objectionable behavior, while what seems moderately dislikable is actually fairly mundane. This incongruity is layered on to brilliant effect.Now, many are praising the supposedly deep, revelatory social commentary on the nature of class struggle, but I don't find it nearly as profound as is claimed. The overtly sensational, absurd plot if anything detracts from the relatability of a social message, and the storyline (even leaving aside the over-the-top scenes that are exaggerated for cinematic effect) is chock full of innumerable ordinary lapses, discontinuities and implausibilities to the point of distraction. More importantly, the characters are all minimally developed and characteristic of a one-sided view of the world in which people act out their base grievances and fantasies over a veneer of class-determinant normalcy. It strikes me that there is little to no consideration of virtue, even in momentary antithesis. Yet if this is the social revelation then it is a deeply cynical one, and also an implausible one because the world is not so one-sided and simple. For this reason, the film ends up revealing very little realistic insight into the human character or social dynamics. It is not a bad film as it is well executed and clever in its emotional manipulation, but I am not willing to dole out gushing praise.",False
25,3,Nonsense,jonaswilmann,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA veteran chauffeur, his wife and their kid wonders, one fluent in English, the other an art wiz with expert computer skills and mastermind deception skills, are all unemployed (!) and lives in a scummy basement, where they fold pizza boxes for peanuts. With wildly implausible easy they con a rich family (ridiculous caricatures of rich people who apparently got rich by being soooo stupid) into employing them. First the son, then the sister, then the father ... you get it ... sleep-inducing snail's pace to the predictable setup where the entire family has leeched their way into the rich people's home. Once inside the home, the rich family goes on a vacation, and the poor family literally start ripping the home apart in a stupid drunken frenzy?? The old housekeeper (which they got rid of in a horrible way, causing a dangerous allergic reaction) shows up, and for some reason they let her in?? Turns out the old housekeeper is keeping her husband in a hidden basement under the house, where he has been living for four years (best explanation to why is that he is hiding from loan sharks). He has been flickering the lights morse code-style which the small boy of the house has deciphered (but he never tells anyone and it is therefore utterly pointless). Each family now knows each other's secret, so they are in a stalemate. Right? Movie apparently forgets this, an instead we end up with a big fight. A lot of nonsense. A flood. Then a lot more violence. Poor father kills wealthy father (because of his arrogance towards the poor which have a certain odor), then leaves his own two wounded children to die, running to hide in the basement (he would actually have to step over his son, who lies half dead in an enormous puddle of blood in order to get to the basement, but I think the director forgot this - add it to the five million other plot holes!). At some point near the ending - where the movie takes another tonal shift towards the sentimental - I realized that we are actually supposed to sympathize with the poor family, despite how EVIl they have acted the entire movie ... This movie is wildly implausible, first half wildly predictable, full of weird tonal changes and plot holes. Everything is overly constructed to underline some muddled point about social inequality, but nothing really makes sense. I loved ""Snowpiercer"" but this is total crap.",True

1,9,Fantastic Peaches!,Blixta,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a very intermate documentary! They use a lot of Super 8 footage and just personal videos from her life. I did not know so many things that come to light here like that she worked with children, singing and playing a guitar before and when she decided to try this musician stuff out.We follow here on an 20 year anniversary tour for her debut album, Teaches Of Peaches that came out in 2002. The highlight being one in Berlin, where she lived just before she went back home to Toronto to make the album. It's a ride! I had forgotten the hair-costumes but that showed me a bit of how much influence she has had because on Doja Cat tour, earlier this year, I saw nearly an copycat of that outfit in an Youtube video. It's a flashback to a time where she was shock-punkrock, that is much wider today. She said that she walked on audiences on all the performances and it's beautiful that a 56 year old icon does not give AF. That image is so like Iggy Pop.",False

1,6,Blah Blah Blah (whispering: We Need New Talent),sleeplessinyorks,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWell, this is a documentary made by Pixar about Pixar's talent incubation programme that they run for their employees. As such, everything looks a-ma-zing!Putting that aside, one cannot help but wonder, why is Disney doing this? Oh , yes! They need to esnure that they keep churning successful Pixar feature films. It is admirable, nonetheless, that a company looks inwards to find new ideas for their projects. After all, they employ thousands of artists. Statistically speaking, if one threw a stone, it would, more likely, hit a talent.Visibility and inclusiveness are key! #fact Alas, it's been delivered in a very self-centered manner, coming across as Disney patting themselves on the back.This is further compounded by having what appeared to be white cis-gender CEOs and COOs, (or whatever their titles were).More diversified comment is needed, so such faux-factual programming has no need to be produced #fact.",True

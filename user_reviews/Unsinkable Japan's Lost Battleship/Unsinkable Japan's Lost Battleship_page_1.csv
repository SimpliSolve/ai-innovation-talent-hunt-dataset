1,6,A good documentary...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,15/08/2025,"I stumbled upon the 2020 documentary ""Unsinkable: Japan's Lost Battleship"" by sheer random luck. And given the fact that I was wholly and completely unaware by the existence of the Musashi, then I didn't really know what I was in for here.But alas, I do enjoy documentaries and this felt like it could be interesting, as there is something alluring and fascinating about ship wrecks to me. So of course I sat down to watch ""Unsinkable: Japan's Lost Battleship"".And I will admit that this 2020 documentary was definitely entertaining and enlightening. But then again, given my lack of knowledge about this Japanese battleship, then of course all information gained here was completely new to me. But it was a documentary that was nicely narrated and brought to surface - pardon the pun - some interesting aspects and historical facts.While ""Unsinkable: Japan's Lost Battleship"" was watchable and enjoyable, it was hardly a documentary that spurred an interest in me to waltz out and start delving into the historical information surrounding the Musashi battleship.My rating of this 2020 documentary lands on a six out of ten stars.",False

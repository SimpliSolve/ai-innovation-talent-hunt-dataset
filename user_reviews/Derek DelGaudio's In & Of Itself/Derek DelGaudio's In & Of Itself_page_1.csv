1,9,Amazing Show!,arcadebloom,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm surprised nobody is mentioning David Blaine's appearance as an audience member - when Derek called him brother, he cried.",True
2,9,Who Are You?,kristarosephillips,n/a,16/08/2025,"Derek will take you on a journey. If you like questioning preconceived notions of identity, being, self, and labels -Please watch this without knowing ANYTHING about it. You will be left knowing more about who you are.",False
3,9,Truly one-of-a-kind.,matthewssilverhammer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Man, I wish I lived in New York... At times, I thought this magic act/one-man show might be the most pretentious thing I've ever seen; by the end, I thought maybe the pretension lies in me, arrogantly thinking my ability to discern meaning from someone else's work is what gives it value. That's how powerful this is; that segment/trick at the end alone, of Derek ""seeing""/"" naming"" every audience member, was undeniably breathtaking.",False
4,10,"Best ""Magic"" show ever.",Edmund_Apperson,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all the cover image of the video is of my wife and me when we saw this in NYC. We loved the show live and think the movie has found a way to capture the essence of the live performance. My wife had said it best this is her review:It really is a raw and powerful show. I don't think anyone can watch this show and not be affected by it. So many of the people in the audience were deeply moved, and some were brought to tears. Derek is deliberate in his presentation, he is piercing in his gaze, he uses silence as well as words, and when he does speak, you are hanging on every word. Oh, and he's incredibly talented too. I chose I AM a dreamer. Edmund chose I AM a trickster, but seeing what some people chose for themselves was at times beautiful, funny, and incredibly sad. Fantastic show. 522 shows.",False
5,10,R for Rouletista,Quinoa1984,n/a,16/08/2025,"As many have said, go in knowing as little as you possibly can. All I can think of put down here is this brilliantly written and designed theater-magic-show-cinema-confessional hybrid is about how labels create us (or may try) and how we either stick to them or transcend them. Are you the dog, the wolf, or in that space in between? You're still somebody's son, or mother, non? What Id also add is Delgaudio is a master showman, but his greatest skill as an artist is empathy and connectivity. I can't explain what he does (the letters most of all), and I don't want to. It is perceptive on a level that I can't put into words, except to add that in the 21st century, when everyone in life (or especially online) gets pigeonholed, it is.... necessary.I haven't been at all religious in my life, but.... Is this what it's like to believe in the unbelievable? Oh, and a late-era masterpiece from Oz, who I wasn't sure would return to filmmaking but, my god, the editing and mix of animation really does a trick here as well.",False
6,10,Extraordinary,kay_rock,n/a,16/08/2025,"Please go in without reading up on what you are about to see. Turn off your devices, make sure you won't be interrupted, and just experience it. If your partner/housemate/friend is a chatty show watcher, watch it alone.It's hard to write a review that doesn't tell you anything, but I think it's quite important not to know what to expect. It can be a deeply moving experience.",False
7,10,Profound,craig-disko,n/a,16/08/2025,"I learned something tonight. Not about myself, but about others.Thank you Derek.Yours,A Fraud",False
8,10,"Ignore all comments other than this, this is all you need to read",dire-91496,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watch it. There are people who dislike it, and there are people who loved it. No person is going to be able to decide whether you like this or not except you.",False
9,10,Beautifully Heart-Wrenching,tiffanyappersonsc,n/a,16/08/2025,"We saw this show in NYC and we're absolutely stunned. I couldn't turn away from Derek for a minute. I went to this show not knowing much about it, but whatever preconceived notions I had about it were gone in the first fifteen minutes. I felt a heaviness during the show, but I left with a feeling of calm wonderment. To the person who panned this performance, I'm sorry you felt the need to write such a terrible review while at the same time giving props to a different ""illusionist"". Different strokes for different folks. We also went to see Darren Brown's show in NYC, and while I'm not into mentalism, I would never dream of panning the performance. It was great for what it was; it just wasn't my thing and was night and day different from this. I will watch this several more times on Hulu. It's THAT good.",False
10,6,Interesting performance art,ezmailuse,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this based on a tweet from Henry Winkler (Barry, Happy Days). I knew nothing about it other than Mr Winkler liked it. The show is an exercise in identity and includes some phenomenal sleights of hand. The camera is close up on Derek's hands and his skills are amazing.Spoilers
The story that ties the different facets of Derek's life together to help us learn his journey is too disjointed to adequately provide a smooth transition from one segment to the next. The two segments that were the most impressive (other than his card handling) were when people randomly selected from the audience randomly select a letter from a pile and then read it to themselves and then out loud. Many of them burst into tears reading these letters, and we learn that they are from their relatives or friends. So, not really random at all. This viewer felt manipulated since the method of the selection appeared random, but clearly some clever behind the scenes work made sure these letters were made well in advance and would wind up as planned in the hands of those ""random"" people. The second impressive thing was the end, when Derek somehow was able to assign each I AM card to the exact audience member with 100% accuracy. Amazing trick and or memory exercise or both. I believe I saw David Blaine, Bill Gates and Tom Ford participating in the audience. That was interesting but also made it feel even more of a trick than some personal identity epiphany.Bottom line, some really good moments with over-dramatic staging.",True
11,9,It's a kind of magic.,Fizzlefried,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let me tell you a story, are you sitting comfortably, then I'll begin.
Stop reading and just watch, why do you need other people's affirmations? The consensus says... Who cares?It is truly marmite. Some will love it's affirmations of self, that we all long to be seen and take joy in the message. Others will see through it's emotional trickery and slight of hand Tom foolery and walk away with nothing. For those people I feel truly sorry.Losses one star because the medium would be more powerful in person and now I've seen this I can never experience it for the first time in real life. For which I feel sadness.
Excellent performance.",False
12,6,A tad pretentious,mikeborgen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWell, I know some people will really like this movie but I'm not one of them. The film itself is considered a documentary, but I don't consider it that, but rather a performance art meets Tony Robbins self-help seminar Meets magic show meets The Moth storytellers.While the Gambler story was entertaining on its own and it was interesting to hear about his lesbian mother and how we dealt with it as a whole I didn't think the whole thing came together, but rather a garbled pretentious collection of stories and self-discovery to make people feel good and cry with a little bit of trickery and slight of hand.The Cameo of David Blaine and him crying because he called him a brother, and I swear I saw Bill Gates professing himself as a leader and the audience to but that might just be my imagination. These cameos alone I found cheesy and took me out of the film altogether.I'm not the kind of person that likes to be forced to feel things, and this film felt like it was trying way too hard to be emotional, a little bit heavy-handed for my taste.",True
13,1,"I feel like I'm living ""The Emperor's New Clothes""",smallvillefunkshow,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went into my viewing interested and intrigued. I had heard many describe their experience as transformative and talked about how they or their friends cried for hours and thought about this show for days, weeks, and months after viewing. My intrigue lasted up until just after the end of the first story when it became apparent that this was all an emotional manipulation put on by the magician. In ""In & of Itself"" Derek Delgaudio manipulates the audience as he would a deck of cards. The emotions he tries to convey feel forced on me like a card he wants me to pull in his trick. The stories are pointless pseudo profound vehicles for a few bits of slight of hand and mentalism, which are few and far between. After watching then seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews online I feel like I am living out ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". This is nothing more than a frowning magician making you believe you heard and saw something amazing. It's the same recipe magicians have been cooking up for hundreds of years, Derek just threw in some other ingredients that taste awful to me.",False
14,10,Emotional Arr,Cammmalot-459-755302,n/a,16/08/2025,"""...and knowing you won't believe me,
that's the only reason
I'm going to tell you the truth""Derek DelGaudio has created something truly in & of itself...It's conceptual, it's emotional, and it's wonderful.Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, experience it and then tell me...""What have you become?""",False
15,10,Absolutely mind boggling,snakevswizard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watch this documentary. It is phenomenal.
There is so much happening in this that you are left filling both fulfilled and utterly empty at the same time. Incredible.",False
16,10,Never seen anything quite like it,juboy70,n/a,16/08/2025,You are best off simply watching this recorded performance whilst knowing as little about it in advance as possible.It really is an astonishing piece of work that shows levels of skill in various departments that are nothing short of genius. That it also packs an immense and genuine emotional punch results in an experience you won't forget in a hurry. Remarkable.,False
17,9,To call this a documentary about magic is doing it a disservice. This is unlike anything I have ever seen before.,garnet-suss,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is insightful, inventive, introspective, moving and thoroughly entertaining.It really is phenomenal and I urge everyone to eatch it.",False
18,10,Fascinating,njtall-05815,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was one of the most interesting and fascinating things I've seen. I've never heard of Derek, I find it extremely difficult to even explain to people what this actually is. All I can say is watch it and experience it for yourself. We should be applauding such originality and thought provoking content.",False
19,10,Emotional mind magic,Pukeonthestreet,n/a,16/08/2025,You'll find yourself crying and eventually realize that empathy is amazing.,False
20,6,All seems a bit contrived,michael_erett,n/a,16/08/2025,Lots of disjointed parts to a story that don't really have anything to do with each other... what's the log book about with respect to the roulitest or the time between dog and wolf.... its just disjointed tripe that doesnt deliver an overall encompassing story. Lots of irrelevant parts to the show are dressed up as profound revelations that we ought to think deeply about but they really have no profound meaning. I did appreciate the performance and it is a polished delivery. The magic is decent but the teary eyed audience are just desperate to find meaning in anything. They are wrapped up in the moment ok but it's all a bit pathetic.,False
21,10,Utterly Mind Bendingly Emotional,user-968-582176,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the most profound film experiences I've ever had. Derel DelGaudio's In & of Itself is a illusionary thought space that causes the viewer to literally question their own identity.The show unfolds through a series of stories, card tricks, and audience interactions and truly break the 4th wall to yield a stunningly emotional experience.Much of the film is impossible to express in words, its something you simply have to experience for yourself.",False
22,2,Disappointing,gabrielledarch,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had high expectations based on the reviews, but must say I am terribly disappointed. Derek's emotions seem fake, the audience looks staged, and the ending was just not convincing. It was almost 2 hours of me waiting for something incredible to happen, but it never did.",False

His fun with the audience impressive
He reminds me of Darren BrownThe audience is good at acting there parts and Derek really is good at his illusions.It is well worth watching and probably worth a repeat performance.The sound is Good
The Photography is Good
The Entertainment is Good.Enjoy.... 👍",False
24,9,Magical,ThomasDrufke,n/a,16/08/2025,"A work of art that will hit you right in your soul while at the same time challenging your brain like no other. Go in blind and leave the film without the temptation of looking up the answers your looking for, just let your mind work it out yourself. In and Of Itself is a magical experience.9.5/10.",False
25,9,In & Of Itself 2021 Review,chandean-69762,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a one man performance that's meaningful, beautiful and emotionally heavy all in one. You just have to give it a watch to experience it. This really feels one of a kind.
It will stick with you, and probably make you look at things in a different way, which is something most performances / films don't pull off as easily as this does. It's just beautiful. Please go in blind to get the best experience possible.The only thing I have to say is I was bawling my eyes out up until I noticed David Blaine and Bill Gates and I was a little taken out, but brought back in at the very end.",False

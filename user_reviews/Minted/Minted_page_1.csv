9/10
(游냥游냥游냥游냥游냥游냥游냥游냥游냥/10 fascinating piglets)This is a documentary. I love when documentaries cover both sides of an issue - that leaves you feeling good about which side you are on previous to the viewing, but makes you question the side that you don't believe in after the viewing.This is that perfect documentary.I love art and all its disciplines and the process of creation. I'm fascinated by it. I was hoping that this was going to come down very hard on NFTs. I hate the idea of them.But what I realize now is that NFT's are just the progressive next iteration of art.It explores a new way to make any kind of art, not just physical art. It also goes into the horrible elite commandeering this art form for no other purpose than to make money, which interned really hurt the people that used it for true art making purposes.

1,10,A Beautiful Unforgettable Masterpiece that shows the true cost of war.,The_Fifth_Echo,n/a,15/08/2025,"I decided to watch Grave of the Fireflies yesterday. My friends told me it was extremely moving and sad. I hesitated at first, but then I said ""Oh well, I'll give it a try."" At the end of the film, I was crying my eyes out. This was the best animated film, I've ever seen.This is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war.This movie isn't your regular Animated Film. Pixar and Disney put films out there with happy endings. I'm not saying there bad films at all. They are also great pieces of work. But Grave of the Fireflies tells you the truth. This movie isn't trying to entertain you. It wants to inform you about how war is really like. There were many moments in the movie, that just brought me to tears.I am kind of upset, that this movie didn't get many awards as it should. In that regards, it is VERY underrated and it is kind of thrown apart. When it should really be respected and praise it. If this movie was made in our time period right now. I would be 100% sure this would of Won an Oscar for Best Animated Film. This is Studio Ghilbi's best movie they have ever released.I truly advice you to bring a handkerchief, cause chances are that you will cry.An Emotional Epic Animated Film, that I recommend everyone to watch.Quite Simply 10/10",False
2,10,The best movie you'll never want to see again,Nogami,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had the fortune of being able to see Hotaru no Haka on the big-screen in Seattle a couple of years ago.  It was truly the high-point of my film festival excursions.  At the end of the movie, there was silence, absolute and total silence in the theater - and then, only an occasional sniffle until the end credits had finished rolling and the house lights came up.  It would've seemed almost disrespectful to profane the silence with words.Seeing a movie like this really changes attitudes about war - about who really suffers, and that the honor and glory is shallow comfort when you contemplate what has been lost in the struggle.I've made the comment to my friends that if you ever see someone who isn't moved (usually to tears) by this movie, you've found someone without a soul. As difficult as it is to watch, turn off the phone, dim the lights, and immerse yourself in the film with ones you love - you will be a better person for it in the end.There are many other reviews of this movie, and most of them are probably far more comprehensive than my own - I'll conclude by saying that this movie should required viewing at some point (as should the peace museums at Hiroshima and Nagasaki) for everyone.When you see war and conflict in the news or read about it in the paper, think back to this movie - your perspective will probably be broadened, and your eyes opened a bit more.I've only watched this movie about 4 times - it usually takes a year or so to ""decompress"" after watching it.  To see it too often would lessen the impact, and that would be the worst possible thing to do to this movie.",False
3,10,"A masterpiece, whose beauty is often overlooked",Lupercali,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen I watched this movie, I steeled myself for a traumatic experience, based on every review I'd ever read of it, which usually include phrases like ""don't watch this if you're suicidal."" Instead, if I had to pick a single word to sum up the movie I saw, it would probably be 'beautiful'.Certainly it was sad, and arguably depressing, but I've read this movie compared with 'Saving Private Ryan'. That's ridiculous. 'Grave of the Fireflies' is gentle and poetic more often than it's violent, and it's remarkably restrained in its anti-war message. It simply tells a story : there's very little at all in the way of moralizing or polemics. Why would a story like this need such heavy-handed tactics?I've also read it argued that the movie is robbed of any suspense or impact when it's revealed in the opening scene that the main characters are dead. I have a quite different view of that device.Firstly. the beginning of 'Fireflies' is, for all intents and purposes, a 'happy ending'. This is such a non-linear plot development that you could fail to notice it, and thereby only see the movie's gloom. The moment where the ghostly Seita takes the ghostly Setsuko's hand and nods to her is not only a happy moment, it signifies that the suffering - which is yet to come, as far as the viewer is concerned - is over, and they are together again (albeit still without parents).As for a character revealing that he is dead in the first line of the movie, this is a device which has been used in centuries if not Milena. The crucial thing here is that 'Fireflies' isn't _about_ tension. It tells a story whose ultimate conclusion you already know (a legitimate narrative approach), and everything which happens during that story is emotionally infused with a foreknowledge of its ending. You find yourself hoping that things will go right now for Setsuko and Seita, and then the knowledge that ultimately it won't undercuts you with real emotional power. You know the characters are going to die, but you hope things won't be so bad in the meantime. It doesn't take much of an effort to make that an analogy for our own lives, which makes us all fireflies.Perhaps what might make someone feel disappointed or cheated by this film is simply that it's so damn honest. I mean that: it's one of the most honest, artifice-free movies I've ever seen. It doesn't even really try to ram an anti-war message down your throat there is very little overt violence, and if there are some scenes of corpses and suffering, it's never gratuitous, and it's over quickly. Compare this with 'Private Ryan', where you have to suffer through 40 minutes of the most horrific blood and guts, only to reach a conclusion which, after much blood and thunder, signifies very little.'Fireflies', OTOH, has far more beauty than gore. This is what really surprised me about it. Probably two thirds of the movie takes place in gorgeously drawn, tranquil rural or urban settings, with an almost pleasant dreamlike quality - even when the American bombers are flying overhead at one point there is a surreal, almost serene sense to it - and there are plenty of moments of happiness to offset the undeniably sadness and frustration of other scenes.Perhaps best of all, Setsuko is one of the very, very few (if not the only) animated 4 year-old I've ever seen who actually _behaves_ like a four year old. I'm so sick of seeing preternaturally smart, sassy, sophisticated and precocious children in Hollywood movies. Setsuko's emotion and behaviors are _exactly_ right for a completely normal four year-old, and recognizing this lends many scenes incredible poignancy. Similarly, Seita is a teenage boy who behaves with the sort of mixture of pride, compassion and hubris which you'd expect of someone his age. He still believes that Japan will win the war he thinks it's up to him to take care of his sister with their mother gone and father who knows where. This leads him to make mistakes: possibly the most obvious one being where he fails to take the farmer's advice, swallow his pride and ask his nasty aunt to take them back in again. You would probably have to say his decision not to even try - to go it alone instead, was a very bad one, but - hello, people - here is a character who makes mistakes because he's actually human: a believable teenage boy in an extraordinary situation, who doesn't miraculously save the day, because his best judgment just isn't good enough.Of course, his aunt may well have knocked them back anyway. Who knows?Don't go into the film expecting tension, drama or even a tirade against war. It's a movie about the beauty and fragility of life and youth. If you think Japanese animation is all giant robots and superhuman schoolgirls, this could be the film which changes your mind. It's slow, poetic, beautiful and sad, and extraordinarily honest.I must be the only person who didn't cry during this film (and I mean, I get choked up during some Disney movies). Yes, it is sad, but its beauty and honesty is what I'll remember.NB: this review refers to the subtitled version of the film.",True
4,10,Haunting,Black Rainbow,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was warned this movie would be emotional, but I had no idea just how understated that was.  By the end, my friend and I were huddled together, pouring out tears I've never shed for any movie before.  It was a mix of horror, empathy, sadness, and so many more emotions I can't even begin to list.Visions of this film have haunted me since first watching it, and I would find it hard to watch again, simply from it being so heart-wrenching. Only one movie has ever hit me hard enough to keep me from subjecting myself to it's strong emotions again (The thief, the cook, his wife and her lover).I strongly urge all to watch this, as it rises well about any films I've seen, anime or not.",False
5,10,A powerful film that shows the true cost of war,dee.reid,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Grave of the Fireflies"" is one of the most ambitious, depressing, and quite frankly, best films that I've ever seen. I was nearly moved to tears by this film's brave treatment of such critical subject matter. Yes, it's an Anime' piece, but surprisingly, it came out in 1988, during a time where most Japanese animation films were either relentless bloodbaths, borderline pornography, or both.As a fan of the Anime' genre of film-making, many great pieces have achieved some sort of cult status here in America, yet none have really reached mainstream success. Some have broken through the barrier and have gained acceptance with American critics, like Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Akira,"" or ""Princess Mononoke,"" or ""Spirited Away"" (both films directed by Hayao Miyazaki). One that I've seen and has been barely mentioned by most critics is ""Grave of the Fireflies.""What we have with ""Grave of the Fireflies,"" is a story of innocence lost and two children who ultimately face a losing battle with trying to survive in a small Japanese village in the closing days of World War II. WWII was the costliest conflict in world history, with millions dead and thousands left to pick up the pieces.In the center of it, are the aforementioned two children, who are pretty much left to fend for themselves after their mother is killed in a bombing raid. Because their father is off fighting in the war and they have no way of contacting any other family, they're sent to live with their aunt, who is at first warm and welcoming to them, but eventually becomes very cruel and the children are forced to live in a nearby bomb shelter. From that point on, the two children embark on a journey that is every bit as unpleasant and difficult as the grim realities of the world around them.Very easily one of the best Anime' films that I've ever seen (or any animated film for that matter), I find it difficult to believe just how truly overlooked ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is. The animation is beautiful, though certainly not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made).We get a sense of the dread of the two lead characters, who watch as the world around them crumbles into heaps of ashes, and aircraft loom ominously overhead, dropping their deadly, incendiary cargo on unsuspecting Japanese villagers.The director, Isao Takahata, obviously has a special resentment of the war, but manages to avoid condemning it outright. The director instead lets us focus in on the conflict as seen through the eyes of the two children, who watch unflinchingly as the realities of their world begin to falter before them.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is a bold statement on the condition of the human soul during conflict. I probably shouldn't say this but I am anyways, but this film has to be the ""Schindler's List"" of animated pieces. It's brave, it's not overly sentimental, but it is relentless in its dramatization of a dangerous reality. It should be required viewing in any high school world history class.A beautiful film; not to be missed by anyone.",False
6,n/a,One of the finest films ever made.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOccasionally there's a film that literally changes one's perceptions of the world. 'Grave of the Fireflies' is one of those films. No movie ever made generates such an intense and powerful emotional response as this one.It's an animated film set in Japan during the closing days of World War II. Two children; a boy named Seita and his much younger sister Setsuko; must quickly learn to cope with life after their mother is killed during a fire-bombing raid by American B-29's. The film starts with the children and their mother preparing for the attack, then follows the children as they attempt to survive the death of their mother, and the possible death of their father, a naval officer serving aboard the Japanese heavy cruiser 'Maya.' (A US submarine torpedoed the 'Maya' in late October of 1944 during the battle of Leyte Gulf.)The story of two orphans trying to survive in war-ravaged Japan is not the subject of your typical light-hearted animated film. In fact it may be much too serious for anyone under the age of 14. The first five minutes of the film hits one like a sledgehammer - by far the most emotional opening scene I've ever come across. I found myself already reaching for the tissues, and trying to choke back the tears.Yet there's more than just tragedy in 'Grave of the Fireflies.' It is the most awesome love story one is ever likely to see. But it's far from the typical Hollywood idea of a love story. Instead of the usual highly attractive Hollywood actors of the opposite sex pining for one another in front of the camera, we have an animated Japanese brother and his much younger little sister. It's not a tale of romantic love, but one of 'brotherly' love.Seita loves his little sister, and once he discovers that his mother has been killed in the bombing, he does everything he can to keep his sister from finding out about her horrible death. Then, with typical Japanese seriousness, he begins to immediately provide for and comfort Setsuko; she being the only member of his immediate family he has left. Though not stated in the film, it seems obvious that part of Seita's motivation for looking so carefully after his sister has to do with avoiding his own pain and despair having been left with NOTHING after the bombing attack. No mother, no father, no home. The war Japan is waging against the rest of the world takes its toll on these two little ones, without regard for their feelings or emotions.That which truly broke my heart into ten thousand tiny pieces was the selfless way Seita looked after his younger sister, and shielded her from the horrors all around, especially the lack of food. Films show us many things, some good, some evil, but rarely has any film shown how one person so unselfishly puts another ahead of them self. Seita does makes some mistakes in the way he goes about taking care of his sister, but I can't fault him for his love and his devotion. Who of us have always chosen the best path, the most perfect way of doing things? Surely not I! Seita's obvious love and devotion to Setsuko is the most moving and convicting thing I've ever come across on film.I use the word 'convicting' because this movie convicted me of my own very selfish nature. 'Grave of the Fireflies' caused me sadness not just because of Seita's brave attempts to take care of his little sister; but because he gave of himself so totally and completely, even though his sister was a liability to his own survival. I could not help to be convicted concerning all the many times there have been family and friends who have needed my help or understanding, but I ignored them in favor of 'doing my own thing.' How sad I am for all those times I've ignored the suffering of others and their cries for help. This film showed the evil in my own heart - something that I would not have noticed on my own. But now that the blinders have been removed, I can repent of my selfishness, and look for ways to help others, instead of avoiding them.Some Japanese anime I've seen are very much anti-American. But even though it's the Americans dropping the bombs in this film, there is no overt anti-American message. In many ways, the Japanese civilians are shown in as bad a light as is the American air and naval forces! Their hard hearts and stubborn ways are displayed on the screen without apology; and one can see how the plight of the two children is made even worst by the selfishness of the adults that they have come to rely upon.It would be easy for someone from 'the West' (i.e. The USA, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, etc.) to think that the two children depicted in this animated marvel were the exception, rather than the rule. They lived in very trying times, and surely children in this day and age do not have to go through experiences similar to Seita's and Setsuko's. Unfortunately, that's not the case. There are still major problems with orphans and unwanted children in the former communist block countries of Eastern Europe and Russia itself. There are also large numbers of unwanted children roaming the streets of China, India, Mongolia, and various other Asian nations. We may not here about it on the news, or hear our friends talk about it; but I assure you that there are literally millions of children around the world whose situation is no better, if not much worst than that of Seita and Setsuko.I am very thankful I had the honor of watching this film. I'm also very thankful for the people who put it together. But most of all, I'm very thankful for the positive impact it has had on my life.",True
7,10,More moving than you could ever expect,bdod5489,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is utterly emotionally draining whilst being rewarding at the same time.The animation is both realistic and stylized but that's not the point, the main focus of this film is the character development of the brother and sister protagonists. Their relationship is nothing short of beautiful and touching.And without spoiling anything I have to say that this film touched me in a way no other film has ever touched me in my adult life. One or two films have upset me and reduced me to watery eyes but Grave of the Fireflies had me in fits of sobbing despair. I was a mess! I'm talking total emotional breakdown. Couldn't talk without sobbing! One of the best films I have EVER seen, animated or not.",False
8,10,Brutally honest and heartbreaking,Dark0,n/a,15/08/2025,"Being my first Anime review I thought I'd start off with my one of my favourite pieces of work from who else but Studio Ghibli. Ghibli have rarely produced anime that doesn't fall short of great but Graveyard is something different indeed.Set in the aftermath of World War II, Graveyard is focused on the lives of a caring brother and his young sister (Setsuko and Seita) and how they struggle against both the elements of wartime and a depreciating Japanese empire. The most striking thing about Graveyard is probably how real everything seems. The animation is very unconventional to the likes of say Spirited Away or Laputa but in a good way. The horror of war is beautifully realised through the animation, whether it be the American destruction being shown or the bleak outlook on peoples lives, namely the two main characters. Thankfully it earns every shred of emotion it conveys through these two sympathetic characters that only the coldest of hearts wouldn't warm up to.Avoiding any Hollywood sentimentality, it is often a bleak and depressing perspective depicted but all the more brutally powerful in the process. With my eyes welling up through the duration of the film, it occured to me just how well the Director understands what raw heartfelt emotion is and how to play the audiences heart strings. Nevertheless nothing is shown in a heavy handed approach, no empthasis is put on the Americans nor is there any special attention taken to the war details. If anything the citizens of Japan are shown in the coldest light often giving little help to the plight of others, but demonstrating furthermore what desperate situation everyone is in.Takahata instead decides to focus on the plight of it's title characters against the background of war. With the empire of Japan in crisis and food shortages everywhere it is heart breaking to see a brother struggle to meet ends meet for his sister. Due to the approach taken it borders on being horrifying but fortunately the tone is changed with the spirit put into Setsuko's character. Much like 'The Pianist' the issue is not the war but the struggle and will to survive in it. This is clearly displayed in a plot that revolves around the downward spiral Setsuko trying to feed himself and more importantly the younger and more vulnerable sister Seita. The animation though detailed and indeed beautiful in some sequences (namely relating to the title), is not by any means flashy but captures emotions and interactions between the characters perfectly. It's the perfect mixture of such animation, realistic and highly likeable characters that makes the whole film one tearful experience. Dealing with such difficult issues it's very hard to imagine this being a film and if it was I don't think it would of been done as well.Part of the brilliance also comes from symbology and the association to many different worlds in such a understanding depiction. The child, Seita, is nothing short of perfection in child like behaviour happily oblivious to the desperate situation, amusing herself with simplicity and the quirks of nature and the outdoors. The older brother Setsuko who must carry the burdon of everything is also perfectly portrayed and to watch there decent is painful to say the least. To struggle is one thing but to have shock, shattered dreams and be depended on is something anyone can empthasise with.There may be some people who will shy away from Anime, disregarding it as a mere cartoon. To those people and everyone else I recommend Graveyard as the tonic, which can be appreciated by anyone with a heart and soul. Among the finest pieces of Anime created and one of the most touching war films ever made.",False
9,10,Heartbreaking...,Teebs2,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film proves without any doubt that animation isn't just suited to tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy and violence. This absolutely heartbreaking Japanese anime tells the story of a young boy, Seito and his younger sister, Setsuko, as they attempt to survive the American bombings on Japan in the last year of World War II.The story itself, based on a true story, is powerful enough but the decision to animate the film truly elevates this film to a higher level. This would have been a powerful enough live action drama, along the lines of Spielberg's Empire of the Sun or even Schindler's List. However, the Studio Ghibli team, have brought an extraordinary amount of life to all the characters, but especially the young siblings. Now we're not talking realism as such here - the characters are in no way photo-realistic, they do have the usual characteristics of Japanese anime humans, large eyes and exaggerated expressions. What this achieves however is a heightened level of subtle nuances in expression which are arguably more powerful and provocative than anything a real-life actor may achieve. Some may claim this is overly manipulative or sentimental, but coupled with the characters movements and actions, it gives the characters such a strong, and very human, presence. You truly care for these kids, which is an astonishing achievement. The voice cast (original Japanese) contributes significantly here also.It is the tiny moments which give this film so much power and emotional depth - from subtle expressions to brief scenes showing Seito playing with his sister at bath time, attempting, unsuccessfully, to cheer her up when she misses her mother. The painted backgrounds are works of art in themselves, just beautiful. And of course the scenes with the fireflies bring a touch of pure magic - a heightened innocent reality to contrast the horrific realities of the war.The greatest achievement of this film is that, apart from a couple of obviously sentimental scenes, such as Setsuko's sobbing or illness, it doesn't force any false emotion on the viewer. It really comes from your involvement with the characters. It's completely honest to it's own story and even cuts off scenes abruptly, which could potentially have been milked for cheap sentiment. It often seems to say - This is what happened, you don't need to see anymore. Another of it's strengths is that it really doesn't comment on the politics of the war in any way, just the effects on innocent people.This is an intensely moving film and a masterpiece of animation. If you aren't moved by these characters, you really need to check your pulse. 10/10",False
10,10,Heartbreaking,Nephilim-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerDuring my searches on Anime on the net one day I came across this title. This was 2 years ago.Then last week I went to an Anime convention and at the DVD stand I saw it. I bought it immediately.When I got home 3 days later I popped it in. I was warned about it being tragic but nothing could have prepared me for the wave of emotion that hit me while watching it. I was depressed for a whole day. Even thinking about it made me cry..This is the power of Grave Of The Fireflies..This is not your typical Dragonball Z/Sailormoon/Pokemon style anime. While I love Sailormoon and some Dragonball Z, Grave Of The Fireflies surpasses it by lightyears. I bought it expecting an epic movie like Ghost In The Shell or Akira but even those paled compared to this.We have here a story of a 14 year old boy(Seita) who loses his mother in a firebombing during World War 2. He then has to take care of his 4 year old sister(Setsuko). While at first they're taken in by his aunt the relationship between him and his aunt takes a turn for the worst. He then ends up on the street and the struggle begins... It doesn't take a genious to figure out that things get really depressing, yet I won't spoil the ending..All I have left to say is that you have to see this movie.. It's the most powerful movie I've ever seen... It's painful to watch but still you have to see it...",True
11,7,"I'm probably an outlier on this one: It is well crafted, but predictable",FairlyAnonymous,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerGrave of the Fireflies is a movie that I've desperately wanted to see for a long time. Fortunately, I didn't know about too much of the plot going into it, but I'm afraid that possibly the hype leading up to it might have spoiled the movie for me.Either way, I won't dive too much into the plot of the movie, but I will reference plot points as needed to explain my point of view on the movie.The movie introduces us to the fact that our protagonists are dead and are moving onto the spirit world; however, they look back at what lead them to their deaths. To me, this might have been a mistake, because (for me) I could tell what the plot was going to be from that point on: Brother and sister trying to survive, things get rough, parents probably die, the morals of the older brother probably degrade at some point leading to scenes of him slowly becoming a thief, and in the end they will both die. Unfortunately, THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS.For me, that seriously weakens the film. Introducing the audience to the fact that they both die means that movie has already thrown its most powerful punch. When watching the film, nothing felt surprising because I knew how it was going to end. It was simply waiting to see how the sister would die, and then what leads up to the death of the brother. This kills the tension of whether they are going to make it out okay or not... because you know they won't.Now, considering the characters, I also liked a lot of elements, but had some gripes. The protagonist of the film is Seita, a 14 year old boy with his 4 year old sister Setsuko. As life gets worse during the end of WWII, Seita must find ways to make sure that Seita is alive and healthy... or at least that is what he thinks he is doing. This concept is probably my favorite idea of the film, the fact that we have a very loving brother who wants to help his sister be calm and happy, yet he is completely oblivious to the fact that he is actually dooming her. In one scene, his Aunt complains that Seita should help out with the war efforts if he wants more food. What does Seita do? Plays the piano to make his sister happy. Or in another scene where the same Aunt is frustrated at the fact that Seita does no work and suggests that he should leave if he is going to be so lazy. What does Seita do? He leaves with his sister.To me, this is really fascinating because it shows a character who has such an insane amount of pride that he believes he is completely in control and that he can do what he wants and will still turn out okay. Even when it is blatantly obvious that the path he is taking is doomed, he still chooses to not work to get food or to go back to his relatives for help. In the end, this leads to the death of him and his sister.However, I do think that Setsuko is a bit of an issue. I understand that the character is a little kid, but I found her fairly bland as a character. Granted, this is more realistic, but I felt that she was mostly used for nostalgic purposes rather than as an actual character. The only time where I was actually interested in her character was when she was on her deathbed, because she starts to become compassionate and very concerned for Seita, in contrast to the rest of the movie where she is only complaining about her own issues.On an ending, I think a part of the reason I can't quite get into this movie is because the themes of the movie are probably much more confident to Japanese culture and the conflicts during the end of WWII. I know that the Japanese public were mad at their government for not giving up sooner (which lead to massive tragedies) so I have a feeling that Seita's pride may be a representation of those who continued to push the war forward even though it was clearly a bad choice.So while watching the movie I realized that a good portion of the movie's greatness might be tied to its cultural relevance. While I know a lot of people in the West really like this film and say ""It is sad movie about how war ruins lives"", and I feel like that is missing a lot of what the movie was trying to say. While the war is happening in the movie, very little of it is actually discussed. I would say that the most important theme that I got out of it was ""Don't let your pride lead to your destruction.""All in all, beautiful film at times, but I just couldn't quite get into it due to its intentional predictability.",True
12,8,Greatest War Film?,gavin6942,n/a,15/08/2025,"A tragic film covering a young boy and his little sister's struggle to survive in Japan during World War II.Apparently people, including Roger Ebert, consider this one of the greatest -- or perhaps the greatest -- war film ever made. Now, that is interesting because it is a cartoon. You never expect that, and this might not be something you want to show kids. It is pretty bold, with wounded people, maggots, and anyone can die.Even more interesting is how it takes place from the point of view of a Japanese youth during World War II. He is not nationalistic, he is not anti-American, he is just a kid. And is that not the truth of war? No matter who is right or wrong, millions of kids become the victims.",False
13,7,"Respectable effort, but I wished for more depth to the characters, as well as less frustrating character actions!",the amorphousmachine,n/a,15/08/2025,"(SOME MAJOR SPOILERS) Animation is often a favourable genre as far as I'm concerned regardless of the maturity of the content. 'Grave of the Fireflies' tackles a tough issue, and is pretty much an animated film for adults or older children. As the content deals with the children who are left behind during any-given war, and how they become adjusted to a new way of living.Naturally, being an anime film, it takes the Japanese perspective of World War II, and how the American fire bombings affected the civilians, particularly from the viewpoint of teenage boy, Seita, and his extremely young sister in Setsuko. In the opening scene of the film, it displays the tragic outcome of the lead character, so we immediately know that this isn't going to be a very happy film! The journey of Seita and Setsuko is an interesting one, but also, a frustrating one to watch.I found myself a little annoyed at some of Seita's actions, although it can be related to youthful rebellion and ideals of being able to survive in the wilderness on your own. The conflict between the Aunt towards Seita and Setsuko seemed extremely harsh, and there could have been more depth to the Aunt's intense dislike of her relatives, cause I think it was needed. Although, I did like the play on the Aunt's use of provisions, and her sense of worthiness when allocating them to her immediate family- even though Seita had provided those provisions. It was a subtle way of showing something deeper to the relationship. The Aunt seemed to think they were ungrateful, yet she was equally ungrateful for what they had sacrificed! The scene where the Aunt asks Seita about school is priceless in displaying the undertones of her manner towards him, revealing the nature of her contempt for him- but I still wish there was more exploration as to why she disliked a young boy and his four-year old sister so much. It seemed a little harsh that any person would treat children like that after a horrendous aftermath to their living situation, and especially during wartime survival, and that's why I think there should have been more exploration of that family unit's history. There was a subtle hint at the Uncle's cowardice, but again, his character was hardly in it to be given depth.The other problem I had was Setsuko. She was far too young to be realistically left in the care of her brother, and she seemed to be able to comprehend far too much for someone so young, and as a character, I found her slightly annoying. There was some touching moments between her and Seita though, especially when she follows him to the police station, as well as when he's trying to shield her from the horrors of war. 'Grave of the Fireflies' really gets over the desperation of trying to cope with hunger, shelter in the aftermath of war- but it just lost me with the lack of humanity of Seita's closest relatives, and with the irresponsibility of his later actions. Even during the first bombing, I seriously doubt any mother would leave her youngest daughter out of her own sight. So, while some people may say this film is the essential war film, or more precisely, ""anti-war"" film- I personally think that is tad overstating its importance. A good animated film that is anti-war- and shows the aftermath of it in a realistic manner-- then perhaps that is fair! However, it's not the essential anti-war/war film, and if you can cope with the characters, then this film is pretty rewarding and somewhat haunting! It is, however, a tad overrated in my book! A reasonably good animated film for adults showing the repercussions and the aftermath of war! ***½ out of *****!",False
14,5,"Sorry, but I didn't like it...",tuxedojacob,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAlright, so before everyone starts flaming and wishing a pox on me and my progeny, hear me out...I just rented Grave of the Fireflies on DVD from Netflix and watched it for the first time tonight. Let me preface things by saying I love Miyazaki movies and some other anime - Steamboy, etc. And also that I understand that quite a bit of anime is about the emotional impact or inner conflict more than cohesion.Throughout the film, we see a lot of legitimate drama with the mother dying of severe burns and injury, with some implied lack of sanitation and proper medical facilities being to blame, and later the father is revealed to be dead at sea, which does a good job setting the tone of death and heartbreak that will be felt throughout the movie.Arguably the most major thread (that's supposed to have the greatest impact) in the movie was the hardship brought on by war and the eventual tragedy of Setsuko slowly dying from hunger and malnutrition - and then as we see in the beginning, Seita losing his grip on sanity and eventually life.But where I start having major problems with the story to the point of ruining the drama entirely is when Setsuko and Seita leave their extended family's home to live on their own. We see their hardship and struggle getting enough to eat to the point that Seita begins stealing food and goods to trade for food... when we JUST heard earlier in story that they have enough money in the bank to ""live off of"".So, the film had some very interesting scenes, it was very artsy and thought provoking, but the real tragedy seemed to me to be Seita forgetting he had assets at hand with which to prevent Setsuko from being hungry in the first place - even if they would have eventually been exhausted.So it's basic logic is what holds the drama in this film back more than anything else. There's no due tragedy. It's tragic, yes, but not in the same way that say a film like ""Life is Beautiful"" is tragic - all the hardship in that film was undue, unearned, and the characters did everything reasonable in their power to avoid it, which is where the drama comes from.TL;DR I am daring to disagree with the anime fan community, that a movie MUST be great because a little girl gets sick and dies when it would have had some weight and meaning if it weren't for the abundant and obvious relief available to the characters in the last arc of the film.Am I wrong?",True
15,n/a,Powerful and Heartbreaking,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""September 21, 1945...That was the night I died.""-- SeitaReading war statistics and even seeing bloody images on television does not fully communicate the horror of war as well as the heartbreaking Grave of the Fireflies, an anime feature directed by Isao Takahata, a long-time colleague of Hayao Miyazaki. The film tells the story of two children, Seita, a 14-year old boy and Setsuko, his 4-year old sister and their uphill struggle to survive the effects of American firebombing in Kobe near the end of World War II. Based on the semi-autobiographical novel of Akiyuki Nosaka, Grave is a powerful experience that powerfully communicates the strength of the human spirit to carry on against overwhelming odds.Though despairing, the film does not resort to cheap melodrama to achieve its effect but delineates simple and direct images that are not watered-down to appeal to the children's market. It would indeed be too sad for most children under 13. In an interview with Cedric Littardi, AnimeLand magazine from 1992, Takahata said that he did not set out to depress the audience but to show a natural death, as opposed to a ""scientific"" death, the way most of us view it -- behind closed curtains in a sanitized hospital.Takahata in some ways softens the impact of the tragedy at the outset by showing Seita dying outside a subway station and his spirit reunited with his little sister Setsuko. The story is told by flashback as the two children are left alone to fend for themselves when their mother is killed in the bombing campaign. When their father is also killed in the Navy, they must struggle against starvation, the cruelty of an aunt they trusted, people's general indifference, and their own pride. Though both children eventually succumb to malnutrition (or radiation poisoning), the animation is so lyrical that it creates a magical, dream-like effect. This does not mask the tragedy but makes it all the more poignant.Nothing sums up the message of this film better than the beautiful poem, ""I Come and Stand at Every Door"" by Nazim Hikmat, one of the most important and influential figures in 20th-century Turkish literature.I come and stand at every door. But no one hears my silent tread. I knock and yet remain unseen. For I am dead, for I am dead.I'm only seven although I died. In Hiroshima long ago. I'm seven now as I was then. When children die they do not grow.My hair was scorched by swirling flame. My eyes grew dim, my eyes grew blind. Death came and turned my bones to dust. And that was scattered by the wind.I need no fruit, I need no rice. I need no sweet, nor even bread. I ask for nothing for myself. For I am dead, for I am dead.All that I ask is that for peace. You fight today, you fight today. So that the children of this world. May live and grow and laugh and play.-- Nazim HikmetIn our day where our leaders are busily preparing for another war, it is important to remember the human cost of these plans and the untold suffering they will inevitably bring. Grave of the Fireflies should be required viewing in the Oval office.",True
16,10,Truly Heartbreaking,michael saunders,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler**SPOILERS**I saw ""Hotaro no haka"" on german TV the other day and it has changed my life! Never have I been so moved by a film in my whole life. I cried and cried and cried. Since then I can´t get this heartbreaking story out of my head.After the movie I went upstairs to the bedroom, where my 3-year-old daughter was sleeping. I woke her up and took her in my arms. In the way she talks and acts she is just like Setsuko, one of the main characters in the film. And I can´t help feeling like Seita, her brother - because my daughter and I are alone since my wife left us a few months ago.I found one of the most touching scenes was the one where the dying Setsuko starts sucking the buttons she collected, because she ran out of her special sweets. I will also never forget how her brother cremates her after having tried everything to save his little sister. The most depressing thing with this movie is: you feel so helpless. You think: Man, I wish I could have helped those kids.This movie has changed my whole attitude to life. All the problems you may have - they become so small. Watch it and you´ll be a different person.Michael Saunders",True
17,10,"""Hard to recover from, impossible to forget""",mahlersoboes,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is one of those reviews where I will say at the outset that, if you haven't yet seen the film, you should go see it. As soon as (or even before, if you're the impatient type) you read this review, I urge you to run out and buy or rent it.Because my words simply cannot convey what Isao Takahata's animated masterpiece Hotaru no haka conveys.Known in the English-speaking world as Grave of the Fireflies or, in some countries, Tombstone for Fireflies, Hotaru no haka is the single most powerful anti-war film I have ever seen. As a work of art, it ranks among Picasso's Guernica and Elgar's cello concerto. It succeeds where many American filmslike Fahrenheit 9/11, Apocalypse Now, and even Schindler's Listsimply don't. Hotaru no haka is a grim depiction of innocence lost, not just of its two young protagonists, but of the entire Japanese nation.The story centers around two children: Seita, who is about thirteen; and his younger sister Setsuko, who is four. Their mother dies of wounds when their town is attacked during the firebombing of Japan in World War II, and they go to live with an aunt. While kind at first, she grows to resent the two siblings she must now feed and shelterwhy can't Seita ""work for the war effort,"" as his cousin and uncle are doing? Seita and Setsuko eventually set out on their own to live in an abandoned shelter. But food is hard to come by, and they gradually succumb to malnutrition.Yes, they die. That is obvious from the film's exposition, which shows Seita sitting ragged and obviously malnourished in a train station, a mysterious tin on his person. A janitor throws the tin into the night, where fireflies encircle it and the spirit of Setsuko emerges. She joins her brother's ghost, they board a train to the next world, and the story is told in flashback. ""September 21, 1945... that was the night I died"" is the opening line.The interesting thing about this film is that, although it is Japanese, it neither victimizes the Japanese nor demonizes the Americans. In fact, its deepest disdain is reserved perhaps for the Japanese people themselves, who turn a cold shoulder to the suffering of their children and fellow citizens. Takahata shows us that the true casualty of war is not life, but innocence.The animation, while in the stylized animé tradition, is rooted in realism and rich detail; and, while it strikingly depicts the tragic demise of the characters, it also has many moments of beauty. There is much to be admired visually in this filmhardly surprising, since it comes from Japan's legendary Studio Ghibli, which has produced the most breathtaking traditional animation that I have ever had the privilege to see.All these elementsstory, symbolism, animationcombine to make one big emotional punch in the gut that is hard to recover from and impossible to forget. It's an animated film, sure; but it is one of the most bitingly real films you'll ever see, and the simple fact that it is not live-action doesn't diminish its power. If you have a night to ruin, watch Hotaru no haka. It's a film that you don't want to see, but one that you will never regret having seen.My inevitable ""dub vs. sub"" commentary: The DVD contains two versions of the film: one is a dubbed English version, and the other is the original Japanese with English subtitles. I urge you to do yourself a favor, and watch the Japanese version. I see no point in watching the dub, since you won't be showing Hotaru no haka to younger children anyways....right?",True
18,10,"Beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating",TheLittleSongbird,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an amazing film! Very rarely have I been moved this much by an animated film. Watership Down yes, Bambi yes, Secret of NIMH yes, Beauty and the Beast yes, Land Before Time yes, but Grave of the Fireflies is in a different league. A film that is once seen and never forgotten, a film that is beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating. It is slow moving perhaps and ""depressing"" but it is very poignant as well. I find it very difficult to fight back tears at the film's end. The animation is amazingly detailed, the backgrounds and characters are drawn with such care and you just marvel at the detail that goes into it. The music is both haunting and melancholic and one of the main reasons why the film is as it is. The story is harrowing, as it details Seita and Setsuko's hopelessness. The characters are easy to relate, Setsuko isn't precocious or obnoxious, instead she is quite cute, and Seita shows real love for his sister as well as being a strong protagonist. There are many memorable sequences, but one that springs to mind is the one with the nocturnal fireflies, which is something of true melancholic beauty. Overall, a masterpiece, pure and simple. 10/10 Bethany Cox",False
19,9,"Depressing, but a must see",dbborroughs,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of the great animated films of all time Grave of Fireflies tells the story of a couple of kids as the try to survive in war time Japan. What happens to them should be seen by anyone thinking of starting a war since it tells very graphically what happens to those often forgotten, the children.Like its companion piece, Barefoot Gen, which tells the story of survivors of atomic bombing and the horrors that were experienced by those unlucky enough not to have been killed out right, this film proves that war is hell for everyone, especially the children.Its very hard to send anyone out to see this unhappy little film (The previously mentioned Barefoot Gen spawned sequels, this has not) but at the same time you owe it to yourself to experience, however distantly what sort of monster we unleash upon the world every time we go to war. It helps that however depressing this is, its also a damn good and incredibly compelling story.9 out of 10",False
20,8,A magnificent piece of work and one of the most heartbreaking tales ever told,The_Void,n/a,15/08/2025,"Animation is often seen as a childish medium, and for good reason as kid's films often are animated. However, every now and then an animated film comes along that extends it's boundaries and manages to deliver a very adult story, and Grave of the Fireflies is one of those films. Through it's well observed and very real characters, Grave of the Fireflies portrays a story of loss, heartbreak and the effect of war on civilians in a manner that is more effective and more firmly based in reality than many live action films about the same subject are. We follow Seita and Setsuko, a brother and sister that have lost their parents in the war and are now forced to fend for themselves in the war torn country. How the two go about doing that and the boy's development from a child to a (somewhat) responsible adult due to the change in the surroundings makes up the spine of the movie.I'm not a big fan of animation, but there are some films that are so great that a person's personal preferences are irrelevant, and this is one of those films. The animation is beautiful and certain scenes, including the air raids and anything with the fireflies are amazing works of art. The way the music blends with the images on screen is haunting and beautiful, and helps add to the tragedy of the story. Because we are able to care for the characters, the tragedy is increased ten fold and the story on the whole is a sad one, but few movies have ever matched up to this film's ending in terms of pure despair. The conclusion is absolutely gut wrenching to an extent that few movies have ever matched, let alone animated pictures. The fact that it's so plain and blatant, with no attempt to console the audience takes the tragedy to a whole new level and I don't doubt that many audience members will be holding back tears upon the film's conclusion.This film is a must see.",False
21,6,Well worth watching,fred3f,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMinor spoilers that really don't give much away.On the surface the film is about war and the effect it has on children. However, at doesn't take long before the viewer realizes that this is only the most superficial meaning of the film. On another level is is about the relationship of two children trying to care for each other in a world that seems to have deserted them. The beauty of their relationship and the importance of that relationship even in death is one of the purest and most innocent portrayals in any film. On another level it is about Japanese pride and the self-defeating inability of the Japanese to admit defeat. For example, Seita, the boy, refuses to give in to those who have insulted him even to the point of putting his and his sister's lives at stake. How similar to the Japanese refusal to surrender near the end of the war, even when there was no hope. They were willing to die to the last civilian. It was only the total shock of the A-bomb that got them to do it. On another level it is about the briefness of life. Like the fireflies, life is brief and beautiful. It is the beauty of life that is important.It is not a sad film, it can bring you through the emotions, but even from the beginning when the ghosts of the two children are united, we can see that their love has transcended death. Some politically minded people have described this as an anti-war film, a condemnation of American atrocities in WWII, or a film ignoring the atrocities of the Japanese and blaming their situation on the allies. It is none of these things.If the director is critical of anyone, it is of the Japanese people themselves. He shows the Japanese as fanatically committed to winning the war and supporting their country even when they there was no hope of winning. In contrast to this is their callousness toward the two children who obviously need help. Do anything for the group but ignore the individuals, seems to be their attitude. The children themselves - at least the boy, share this attitude. He is willing to become a thief a liar and even endanger the lives of his own little ""country"" (himself and his sister), rather than surrender to his relatives. So while there are many anti-war films out there, this is really not one of them - it sharp critical look at the Japanese character.The film is not without flaws. While the animation is usually quite beautiful, at times the animation is too static. Generally the pace is good, but at times it is slow. At times points are over-emphasized and made more than once. At times you want to say, for example, ""Okay, I got it. You don't have to show me again that the sister is dying."" When the director over-emphasizes these points, it can be painful.However, the positive aspects of the film are so strong that they easily make you forget the flaws. The strongest theme of the film is the beauty of the relationship between the two children and the beauty of life even when it is brief. You walk away from the film feeling that life is worth it even in the worst of conditions. Not a small accomplish for any work of art.",True
22,10,Make a grown man cry like a baby!!!,abmong,n/a,15/08/2025,"Now I'm usually your typical Die-Hard, Guns Blazing, Sword Swinging, Magic Wielding Anime fan! So there shouldn't really be any surprises when I say that ""Grave of the Fire Flies"" is not ranked among my list of all time favourites. And the prospect of watching it didn't sound too appealing to me at first, considering the rather subdued DVD case cover...(I know, I'm ashamed)That said, this film is a masterpiece of story telling, the calibre of which my current favourite films pale in comparison. I don't think I've ever been more moved by any other films, period!!! I've vowed never to see this film again, as I think revisiting it would lessen the emotional impact of the first viewing. In any case I don't think I need to re-watch it as it's been burned into my memory forever.This is a film that I hate and love at the same time. The beautiful story and the capturing of facial expressions which only a hand drawn animation could fully realise. On the other hand the film reduced me to sobbing wreck, a bitter sweet ending which left me so depressed it took me another two days to get over...Its a must see, but be sure to have lots of tissue paper on hand.

23,7,All around depressing yet it's well executed,Seraphion,n/a,15/08/2025,"The story opens up strongly having the ending shown first, and letting the main character to tell the rest of the story. All around we see people trying to be strong, to be tough in the middle of the harsh environment of war torn civilians. We also see every scope of human nature manifested in this kind of environment, in which people tend to seek their own survival, whatever the means may be. Those can also include how the aunt cheated on the kids about the food and that the aunt's daughter eventually did nothing to help them. What I like from the movie is that there's no depiction of depressed desperation as to leading to suicide. This convey the message to be strong. I watched the Japanese version with English subtitling; the voice acting is very nice. Setsuko's voice are very much the standard cute Japanese little girl, While Seita's voice can really make the character relate to how brothers defend for their kid brother/sister.",False
24,3,A sure candidate for the most overrated animated work ever.,DavidDeRienzo,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe word ""masterpiece"" is thrown around quite a bit. That word should be reserved so that it has merit, but its consistent overuse has reduced the power of what the word once meant. The criterion for earning such a branding should be quite difficult to attain. In the world of anime, nothing has been called a masterpiece as fervently as Grave of the Fireflies. The usually war-torn world of critics is in almost unanimous agreement that the film is ""powerful"", ""tragic"", and a ""masterpiece"". Even Roger Ebert thinks so. All these people couldn't possibly be wrong, could they? I mean, Roger Ebert is famous! Grave of the Fireflies is the story of Seita and Setsuko, a pair of children who find themselves bewildered by the chaos of World War II. Fire bombings have claimed their mother and forced them out of their home, and now they must migrate from one place to another. For a time, they live with their aunt, who really isn't a half bad person, but is painted by the protagonist (through the writing, which feels as though it was written by a resentful teenager) to be a horrible, oppressive witch. Because Seita is so indolent and does nothing but eat, his aunt eventually gives him the choice to either start working or leave.Seita then consciously decides, knowing full well what possible consequences lie ahead, to leave his aunt with his little sister in tow. He decides to live outside with his sister, willingly exposing her to the elements and possible starvation. What happens next is no surprise; the children eventually starve to death, the audience cries, and people shout ""masterpiece!"". But this is no spoiler; the writer tactfully decided to remove any suspense from the story by letting you know the children were going to die in the opening scene of the movie.Now, children dying is quite sad, of course. But that's because they're children. Unless you're some kind of heartless mooncalf, people sympathize pretty well with children on a very fundamental level without them having to gain your adoration through development or emotional investment. But this is a pretty easy way out of those two things. Setsuko was designed to rip the salty water right out of the audience's tear ducts. She's adorable, innocent, and most importantly, helpless. But, from my perspective at least, this is a very effective ploy to incite feelings for characters that otherwise have no narrative value. And judging by the critical response to Grave of the Fireflies, it's a ploy that's worked quite well.But the biggest problem with the theory of Grave of the Fireflies being a masterpiece is the aforementioned choice (yes, I italicized that earlier for a reason). The fact that Seita and Setsuko's suffering is brought about due to a single choice Seita, who though young is certainly old enough to understand the gravity of his decisions, made willingly rather than a situation where he and his sister were at the mercy of their circumstances completely debases any sense of tragedy the film might have had. Seita is simply lazy and too proud to work for his upkeep, and rather than being responsible, he decides to essentially commit suicide and take his sister with him. The lack of sympathy I have for Seita is almost enough to undo my mourning for Setsuko.Another argument for Grave of the Fireflies' masterpiece theory is that it's a powerful ""anti-war"" film. This, like just about everything else people say about this film, is overblown and misrepresented in the work proper. There really isn't any strong anti-war statement in the film. We see bombings and death caused by war, but Seita and Setsuko's suffering is a direct cause of Seita's decisions and not the war itself. The only elements of the war we see in the film, the bombings, are merely a catalyst to set things into motion. Certainly, war is horrible, but Grave of the Fireflies does nothing to state this more than the fundamentality of war being bad that almost all of us acknowledge on a base level without help from a movie. This is not Schindler's List: The Anime, people. Get over it.I hate to add wood to this fire, but even the presentational values of Grave of the Fireflies are not very impressive. The animation is mediocre and pales in comparison to almost the entire body of Studio Ghibli's work. Given, this is in part due to the realistic, subtle art style used to allow us to relate to the characters as being human, but even so, the visual presentation of the film completely failed to impress me. The music sounds electronic, and while I appreciate the subtlety, it's almost completely dismissible. The only place where the film really excels is in the voice acting. The cast delivers very sincere performances and the actors are appropriately aged for the characters in the film.Dying children does not make something a tragedy. It's an easy way to elicit an emotional response. Dropping a few bombs does not make a statement against war. In this case, it's merely an inciting incident to get the characters moving. Combining these two elements does not make something a masterpiece. There are many examples of anime I can think of that offer much more poignant offerings of tragedy and anti-war sentiments (Gundam 0080 immediately comes to mind), so if that's really what you're looking for, I'd suggest you find some of them. You'll only find a paper-thin attempt here that covers itself by tossing out the kiddy card. Sorry, folks. A masterpiece this ain't.",True

Use as many superlatives as you like: amazing, engrossing, compelling, outstanding, it all boils down to one important thing - this film tells a story that grips us with its exploration of the human condition. I imagine virtually everybody who watches it will be able to identify with it in some way or other.So forget this one's a cartoon and just go into it expecting a tale packed with emotion and feeling.

1,10,We need more TV like this!,LeighP-94,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a refreshing change from the quickly tiresome and sensationalized ""extreme"" shark shows they just keep re-doing! Loved watching something new and different that the whole family could enjoy and learn from! The idea of a scavenger hunt is timeless and the Pokémon players in the room thought this was just the coolest idea! We found ourselves rooting for different teams and even had some friendly and silly arguments over who really deserved to win. I was really impressed with the underwater filming quality and the locations they visit over the course of the competition are top-level epic! Made me want to brush up on my SCUBA certification and take a trip! Definitely worth a watch and I hope to see more shows like this!",False
2,10,A new species of nature TV,elshell,n/a,16/08/2025,"My husband and I hadn't planned on binge watching all six episodes in one day but All The Sharks sucked us right in! We enjoy a wide variety of TV programming but appreciated this unique new concept immensely. Combining the excitement of a fast-paced reality competition show with the stunning, endearing, and fascinating visuals and fast facts of natural history and travel documentaries with just the right amount of raw, organic drama and intrigue, I can really see how this series will be appealing and valuable to all ages. There are so many beautiful, interesting, lesser-known or mis-understood creatures in our world that deserve a broader audience. What a great and fun way to entertain and educate!",False
3,1,Another insulting reality show,toddngibson,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am so unbelievably sick and tired of these phony over-dramatized reality shows. Token aspects like the apocalyptic music/SFX and the obviously fake last second countdowns have ruined what could have otherwise been a semi-interesting watch about shark spotting.The part that grinds my gears most is the contempt they have for their audiences intelligence by pretending the contestants are speaking to each other underwater. The dialogue is recorded in post-production (read from a script provided by the producers), which is then overdubbed with a radio filter to convince the audience that these underwater conversations were being recorded live with some magical underwater microphone whilst simultaneously breathing from their oxygen tanks.From the neck-and-neck points tallies, to the ""chosen"" locations, and everything in between - I question the validity of every aspect of this tripe. Perhaps not the most unreal reality show ever made, but still an insultingly transparent attempt to add ""realism"", where none was necessary.",False
4,10,A Breath of Fresh Air for Wildlife Enthusiasts and Beyond: A Biologist's Take,imdbfan-871213,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a biologist with a background working directly with sharks, I typically approach wildlife documentaries with a healthy dose of skepticism. Having witnessed firsthand the sensationalism that often permeates programming like ""Shark Week"" - sometimes even inadvertently contributing to it - I'm all too familiar with the tendency to craft artificial narratives that misrepresent these incredible animals.There's so much inherent fascination in the true lives of sharks that there's simply no need to resort to ""Jaws"" reenactments or fabricated stories to captivate an audience.That's why this series was such a revelation for me. What truly sets it apart is its unique approach: it's genuinely entertaining, remarkably educational, and, most importantly, deeply respectful of the animals it showcases. Unlike so many reality or documentary-style shows, there's no need for dramatic wrestling matches or forced captures. The series understands that the inherent wonder of these creatures is more than enough.While I wholeheartedly give this series a 10/10, I do have a couple of minor suggestions. A touch less scripting, perhaps taking audio from longer interviews, could allow for more natural, concise narratives. Similarly, during underwater segments, it would be beneficial to either remove the artificial talking while diving, or clearly indicate when voice-overs are being used.Despite these small points, I am genuinely thrilled to see a new format emerge that successfully engages a wide audience while maintaining such a profound respect for wildlife. To whoever conceived of this ""Pokémon-esque"" approach to sharks - thank you. Your creativity and persistence in bringing this series to life and securing its place on Netflix have truly paid off. This is a game-changer for how we can learn about and appreciate the natural world. Your impact will be felt in the industry, and you should deserve an award for that alone. You're brilliant.I encourage everyone, whether you're a seasoned wildlife enthusiast or just curious about the ocean's wonders, or just someone looking for a TV show they're unfamiliar with, to give this show a watch. And to the entire team who worked on this series - from the concept creators to the camera crews and editors - your dedication shines through, and it is deeply appreciated.",False
5,10,All the Sharks.,laragna-web,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is so thrilling to watch all these amazingly talented folks watch, search for and discuss sharks. I learned so much about these beautiful creatures, so maligned by society. The contestants truly love their subject. I can't wait for the second series! The photography is exceptional, I especially loved all the reef scenes, and seeing other species in their habitat. I hope this series encourages everyone to respect and support all the efforts worldwide to protect sharks, and do their own research on how important all the shark species are to the marine biosphere. I'm going to watch it again. Great job, everyone.",False
6,1,Worst show ever!,Infinity-33,n/a,16/08/2025,"If I had a dollar for everytime someone self proclaimed themselves as a ""shark expert"" i would be a billionaire. Not one of these people know anything more then just the normal person. Maybe Google thats about it. I been in this world a long time I've study sharks down to the microorganisms that are in there stomach. The facts that these people call them self shark experts is replusive and undoubtedly not true. Show is a joke to watch I wouldn't waste your time. Ig you feel like just because slapping the word shark on a show is going to make it a hit this is not the one I would be watching. To be honest. The other with ocean Ramsey in it is just as bad.",False
7,10,NATURE IS (J)AWESOME!!!,katelyng-233,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am in LOVE with this show!! Any media that we can get for sharks to be less scary (because they aren't) to the public, is what we need!! I was hooked and binged the whole show!! Each episode is exciting and it is like the Amazing Race but BETTER!!! Please please give us a second season!! Seeing all of the underwater shots was so satisfying and makes me wish I was out there searching for the sharks myself. Maybe a trip to the ocean is in order. Love learning new things about our planet and the other animals that live here. Super exciting and I will definitely be watching it again and recommending it to everyone I know!",False
8,3,"""Reality"" Show?",ktwjax1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This concept is really good. I love a show featuring people willingly swimming with sharks! I also appreciate the diversity of the teams. This lets people know this type of activity is not limited to white males.What I do not appreciate is the fake voiceovers making viewers think you can talk to your dive buddy while underwater. Why do this? If it's a voiceover why not let the diver explain what they are thinking/feeling at the time?The other issue I have, and this is the worst, is showing divers going down ALONE. Several times a diver goes down while the partner stays on the boat to (supposedly) fix equipment etc. An expert should never go into a dive (shark infested or not) without their partner. And never after releasing chum in the water.I know these teams have other camera divers in the water, but why even pretend they are alone?People are watching and may think this is ok to do.",False
9,10,More of this please....,DMexotics,n/a,16/08/2025,"We need more programming like this. What a great idea to provide entertainment and walk away with knowledge. I think for you and older viewers alike, this is a great way to reach a broader audience. Whether you clicked on it for the entertainment aspect or the education on nature, you got both. The film work was better than most documentaries that are out there and there are some shots of species in here that I have never seen before. Travel, underwater photography, sharks and marine life, teamwork and competition...what else could you ask for. Excellent watch and I hope to see more in the future :)",False
10,8,Great show! Bad music,TheodoraEh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved watching this. I admire every one of the contestants plus the staff that was around to help them out. The underwater shots were incredible, so much so that I thought half of them were AI. I think I learned a lot about sharks and marine life in general, plus I saw some of the best spots on earth.It was great for a change to see people being around sharks without being terrified, they really made it look easy! Which I'm sure is not.The one thing I absolutely hated was all the effort to make it dramatic by adding super loud war drums music at random times.Once more, congrats to all involved!",False
11,10,Must Watch! Great Show! BEAUTIFUL!,imdbfan-458580,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Stunning Dive into the World's Oceans - A Must-Watch for Ocean and Shark Lovers!I'm so excited to see Netflix jump on the shark train with All the Sharks! As someone who loves everything about the ocean, this series had me hooked from the first episode. I've watched it multiple times and still can't get enough. The underwater cinematography is absolutely stunning, and the variety of oceans they explored-from the Pacific to the Indian and Atlantic-showcased the incredible diversity of shark species and ecosystems. I loved the mix of adventure, competition, and drama. It's well-paced, beautifully filmed, educational, and deeply engaging. Bring on Season 2!",False
12,10,My favorite show right now,BeccaC-57,n/a,16/08/2025,"Imagine if Amazing Race, Pokémon Go, and Blue Planet were mixed together and given a Netflix touch. That is All the Sharks. It's fun, educational, conservation forward without being in your face, visually stunning, and keeps my attention.Four teams of shark experts compete for $50 grand toward their charity and the trip of a lifetime. They gain points by photographing sharks, with higher point values assigned to those that are harder to grab a snap. They are led by a fun host who feels like the kind of guy you want to sit and talk with for hours. There isn't hair pull drama, exaggeration or demonization of the animals as the challenges from a naturally occurring competition are plenty! Strong currents, flooded housings, missed pictures, interfering fishermen, and a little luck all play parts.While the show is a competition at heart there is a lot of education snuck in. Being in the subclass elasmobranchii (cartilaginous fish with 5-7 gill openings) rays get love too! One of the contestants is a marine biologist who specializes in rays and is heard a couple times saying ""flat sharks are sharks too."" The love of the animals coming from every contestant is so apparent and their excitement is infectious. The infographics make sure to point out the conservation status and the number of sharks who are endangered is heartbreaking.Friends that were afraid of sharks found themselves cheering for sightings and it made me want to dust off my scuba gear and go hop in for a dive!",False
13,10,"New, Unique and Bloody Brilliant",TomH-96,n/a,16/08/2025,"All The Sharks is an incredible mix of styles, part contest, part travel/adventure, and part natural history showcase.The footage is quite incredible and is easily on par with anything the BBC NHU would produce. The teams taking part are all unique in their own way and work well to complement each other. The Host ""The Blowfish"" is great at keeping things moving, as well as bringing in expert knowledge and great enthusiasm.Of course, the real stars of the show are the sharks, and All The Sharks does something no other shark show has done before, and that is really give you.... All The Sharks! This isn't just another Great Whites and Tigers show, here we meet a huge array of different species, some probably never featured on screen before.All The Sharks pulls together some incredible elements from across the spectrum to create a fun, thrilling and entertaining showcase, which never loses sight of the real prize, a positive message about Sharks and the health of our oceans.",False
14,10,More Predator Positive Programming Please!,JessicaA-447,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a refreshing predator-positive program, especially as sharks are so misunderstood! It ss wonderful to see many diverse, fascinating species highlighted with messages of conservation woven into a fast-paced, fun competition with intelligent, likeable contestants. It is also refreshing to see that the money at the end of the competition goes to the team's charities of choice to further enhance the mission of conservation. Given that I have an ear implant, I'll likely never be able to safely dive, but I was able to experience amazing dives in gorgeous spots around the globe vicariously. The footage from the dives and the travels is stunning! I really hope that there will be future seasons, and I would love to see other misunderstood species represented, like snakes.",False
15,10,The best competition show on Netflix,JamesH-0739,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was a skeptic, at first, but this show pulled me in quickly, and kept me captivated.It starts with actual animal identification, specifically for ocean predators, and shows that they're not the scary monsters they're typically portrayed to be. The show focuses on conservation, and even shows the rarity of each animal.One of the things I did enjoy is that they categorized it more broadly than just ""sharks"", and offered identifications for other species of cartilaginous fish, bringing more information, and more excitement into the show.This show is beyond worthy of watching.I can't wait for a season 2.",False
16,10,So Much Better Than I Expected,mx-31228,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely loved every single team - Girls Gone Wild, Land Sharks... even when teams got eliminated, it felt like such a loss because they were all SO good at diving! Seriously, every one of them brought something cool to the table.I didn't think I'd be rooting for Shark Docs at first - they always played it safe and kinda copied other teams' strategies - but by the final episode? I couldn't say that I want them to lose. Everyone gave it their all. And the best part? So. Many. Sharks. 🦈🦈🦈I learned so much - didn't realize sharks are made of cartilage, or that rays are basically shark cousins?! Whale sharks totally stole my heart. 🐋🦈Honestly, nature shows like this? Give me MORE. The more the better! 🙌
And hey, it'd be even cooler if the challenges let contestants use more of their own expertise - like Girls Gone Wild sharing their ray research. That kind of stuff makes the show even more special.",False
17,10,"""All the Sharks"" is 10+ STARS",SP-382,n/a,16/08/2025,"Came for the Science, left with many new
Marine life lessons, knowledge of world-class dive & snorkel sites, and beautiful underwater scenery! As an added bonus - the participants were fun, interesting stewards of marine life - especially sharks & rays!First, I'll declare I rarely, if ever, watch nature shows and especially not reality shows/competitions and I almost never leave public reviews or commentaries regarding TV shows/movies. But this program was something new & refreshingly educational that others like myself mght actually enjoy. It's a combination of a documentary & a competition, but not the run-of-the-mill reality series.At first glance, it might be easy to dismiss the program & disregard the entire message of the series - due to that thing hanging off the beard of the host. Overall, HE is a GREAT HOST - energetic, knowledgeable, & entertaining, yet his beard accessory is very distracting & makes it easy to dismiss the serious commentary of each episode. Perhaps make ""shaving it off"" as part of a WIN for Season Two's First Challenge? Obviously that is said in JEST & is NOT a serious suggestion!However, the gorgeous, isolated dive locations around the globe, the experiences of these teams of shark & marine life experts/researchers, & fun facts of each site's unique shark & marine life species, all combine to make this a 10+ STAR First Season! It's difficult to imagine how they'll top this show's debut season, yet there's no doubt viewers will come away anxious to discover more!NETFLIX - please tell us you've already renewed ""ALL THE SHARKS"" for a second season (or more)!",False
18,10,For the love of Sharks!!!,LisaR-348,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hope you get a chance to watch this excellent educational shark show!!! Congratulations Myke Clarkson! So exciting to see your hard work, creativity and dedication to education and conservation....way to go!!! I feel like this show will heal so much damage that Jaws created...thank you!An adventure from episode one! 4 teams diving and snorkeling in the Maldives, Australia's Great Barrier Reef, Japan, Bahamas and the Galapagos! They run into a sharknado, unexpected challenges and exciting and unanticipated sightings! They get extra points for rare species and the viewers learn about sharks, travel, challenges divers face, symbiotic relationships and witness incredible under the sea footage! The teams are competitive but the winning team secures $50,000 for the conservation program of their team's choice. They do have amazing prizes for the winning team at each beautiful location. We are already anxiously awaiting season 2!! Sharks, rays, a sunken ship, and interesting information on the individuals and how sharks became their fascination and dedication to protecting them and our oceans. This is a must watch for families and friends of all ages! An absolute game changer in entertainment and education with conservation for the win!!!",False
19,10,All The Sharks gave All The Joy of shark TV without the insane sensationalism,JackieB-63,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was nervous when I started episode one, fearing the sensationalism that comes with most predator based media. The puns were a bit corny and I was willing to give it time. But within that first episode- I was glued to the TV and binged the whole season!The only two things I would hope for in future seasons is: 1) seeing the contestants look at each other's photos and watch all their faces light up with some of the highlights of rare and exciting encounters. 2) it got a little confusing what the contestants were viewing and B-roll.Can't wait for next season and of course.. All The Sharks!!",False
20,8,A different and exciting new show,mrdanielkanewilliams,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not usually into sea life documentaries but the way this competition show educated and kept me on the edge of my seat really kept me entertained.The fun fact side of the show educates you by telling you different facts about loads of different species of not just sharks but sea life in general. Whilst the competition side of the show keeps you on the edge of your seat when you see 4 pairs of divers compete by trying to photograph as many different types of sharks as possible. But they can't just photograph some sharks, they have to photograph all the sharks because the rarer the shark the more points it scores.To make the show more interesting the competitors travel through 6 exotic locations which look gorgeous and face not just sharks, but also strong currents and equipment mishaps that really push them to their limit. And whoever is leading by the time they leave each location wins a mini prize which is nice to see because some Netflix shows only give out a big prize at the end but hardly anything along the way.So overall I really enjoyed seeing this unique show and hope they make a new series soon, because I can't wait for a second bite.",False
21,10,"A Stunning, Family-Friendly Shark Adventure! 🦈",LM_T,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a mom with two curious kids who are obsessed with marine life, All The Sharks was an absolute gem of a find. From the very first episode, we were hooked. It's not easy to find a show that's both educational and captivating, but this documentary series nails it.The visuals are simply stunning - the cinematography is world-class, and the underwater footage feels like you're swimming right alongside these majestic creatures. But what impressed me most was how the show balances thrilling shark encounters with real science, conservation messages, and stories of ocean exploration.My kids kept asking questions about the different shark species and habitats, and honestly, I learned just as much as they did! It sparked some amazing dinner table conversations, and even inspired a ""Shark Week"" in our house with books and drawings.It's clear that the production team went to great lengths - logistically and creatively - to make this series not only beautiful but meaningful. I'm so grateful to the people who brought this project to life. All The Sharks is more than just a documentary - it's an experience we'll never forget.Highly recommend for families, nature lovers, or anyone looking to dive into something extraordinary.",False
22,10,Refreshingly Realistic (SPOILERS),MountainBoomer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm both a scuba divemaster enjoying all aspects of sealife, and a recreational ""herper"" chasing lizards and snakes topside. One of my favorite TV series during the ""Crocodile Hunter"" era was ""O'Shea's Big Adventure,"" because herpetologist Dr. Mark O'Shea sometimes spent an entire episode looking for a target species and didn't find it. He didn't use a ""pre-caught"" specimen or other means to close out the show; he just admitted that sometimes that's the way it goes. ""All the Sharks"" is much in that same vein, in that some of the most highly-sought targets in a few episodes (thresher, great white, whale shark) were no-shows. While I was initially disappointed as I really wanted to see the thresher, after further reflection I realized this made the series better--rather than hosts (or in this case, contestants) getting improbably lucky on every excursion, it shows the public even the experts often ""strike out"" when pursuing their quarry. This was an enjoyable tour of several wildlife hotspots and kept the audience in suspense every episode--I didn't know which team I wanted to root for as they all had very positive attitudes and a breadth of expertise and experience, which paid dividends for each team in the various episodes. Highly recommend this series!",True
23,10,"""Sharks, Smarts & So Much Fun!""",CourtneyF-71,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a homeschool mom who never gets into shows - but All the Sharks on Netflix? Totally different story. It's jaw-dropping (pun intended), packed with fascinating shark facts, and has this super clever reality-show twist that makes it crazy fun to watch.It's like Shark Week meets Survivor - but smart, family-friendly, and absolutely binge-worthy. My kids were obsessed, I was hooked, and we even worked it into our homeschool lessons. It's rare to find something that's both educational and wildly entertaining, but this one nails it.Don't skip this show. It's everything you didn't know you needed in a docuseries!",False
24,10,Great shark science,AnneC-23,n/a,16/08/2025,Wonderful cinematography with epic views for those of us not able to travel and dive to these spectacular locations! The science based facts make this fun and educational for all ages! I truly enjoyed watching this for fun and to learn some fascinating new insights. I wish we had more programming like this and more shark positive shows. Shark conservation needs to be highlighted like this more often. I highly recommend sitting and enjoying this programming with your whole family and learning about amazing apex predators of the oceans in stunning images. This is really great shark science at its best!,False
25,10,Absolutely Incredible watch!,MaikoC-50,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is a must-watch for anyone fascinated by the ocean. Such a fun and engaging watch with my fiancé we were both so excited every time they captured a new species of shark we hadn't heard of before. Every scene captures the beauty and uniqueness of marine life, especially sharks. What stood out to me the most was the powerful message it delivers: sharks are not the ruthless predators they're often portrayed to be. Instead, the show highlights their importance to the ocean ecosystem and the urgent need to protect them. It's both educational and eye-opening, raising awareness in the best way possible. Highly recommend! This series was a fun and fascinating watch!",False

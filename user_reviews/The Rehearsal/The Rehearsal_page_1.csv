1,9,Nathan Fielder's best,chrsstout,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's self-help reality show satire. Idk how else to put it. If you don't get it, then sorry. His situational comedy hits a little too close to home for some. But for those who have the humility to appreciate the awkwardness of the human condition, then you appreciate just how absurd this show gets. It's comedic inception, I started the show chuckling, and by episode 4 I was in tears. Layers upon layers of absurdity. This show has the perfect guy (and apparently the budget) to do it.A lot of reality shows do the same thing Nathan does in this show. But they polish it up to make it seem like interactions are flawless, use actors to stage nearly everything, and all works out perfectly in the end. This show just exploits that aspect of those reality tv shows. His mindset is (believe it or not) not too far from a regular reality television producer. Nathan just has a little more of a nihilistic approach. I love it.",False
2,10,"So stupid, and yet, it's one of the best things I have ever seen",crbrown25,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everything about this show is amazing. It's an absolute masterpiece.The show is about giving people the ability to rehearse an important event in their life. They go through incredible lengths to make sure everything is perfectly accurate. That part is impressive, but it's not really the best part of the show.Somehow, the makers have an incredible ability to highlight the subtle things that make life complicated, fascinating, weird, and most importantly, human.The Rehearsal is an emotional rollercoaster that everyone should experience.",False
3,8,Days like these I curse the Chinese for inventing gunpowder,winecellarwomack,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fantastic show. So unique and creative! Nothing like this out there! Must watch. I can't even begin to fathom the mind that came up with the idea for this series, but I would certainly love to pick his brain.",False
4,n/a,Kaufman-esque,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know I'm probably the millionth person to say this but this is the most Charlie Kaufman-esque show I have ever seen in my life. The show is really introspective. Reminded so much of Synechdoche, New York, Adaptation, Being John Malkovich and even other films like Eternal Sunshine and I'm Thinking of Ending things. Especially when it came to the idea of a character viewing themselves through the eyes of another person or trying to view experience in that way. It's something that Charlie Kaufman loves exploring and I loved seeing Nathan Fielder's take on it.",False
5,9,Nothing like this on TV,brettpod,n/a,16/08/2025,"I usually wait until the entire season is over before giving a rating. With that said, this show is so funny I couldn't wait. The Rehearsal continues the Nathan Fielder brand of elaborate schemes, awkward interactions, and overall funny situations that he built with Nathan For You. If you loved Nathan for you, you will love The Rehearsal .",False
6,9,No words to describe it!!,karimnomatch,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the most creative, unique, and original show I have watched in many years.. Maybe ever! I loved Nathan For You (NFY) and I knew this show would be good as well. However, while NFY is a comedy show in essence, The Rehearsal is mostly a social experience that is so special and authentic.I will not spoil anything, but I will comment on one scene in Episode 4. When Adam is taken by the ambulance after overdosing, the paramedics are listing his current symptoms, vital signs, and possible drugs he is on, and being a physician I was impressed by the accuracy and amount of work that went into a 5-second scene. This is a simple example of the attention to details and the amount of effort put into this amazing show.",False
7,9,i came into this show wanting to laugh. i left it fighting tears.,rxckne,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nathan Fielder is truly one of a kind. Yes every human in existence is one of a kind but this is a different kind of one of a kind. No show is a one man army and it obviously takes many individuals to make something like this happen. Nathan's crew went above and beyond with his requests in this show and deserve nothing but respect and applause for their work. Nathan in particular had the vision, but by the time you finish season 2... wow. He takes full control of everything... literally. You'll look back at season 1 wondering how you even got to that point, but the destination is completely worth it.Season 1 had something special to it, partially because that was my introduction to Nathan. But I kept wanting more out of some of the one off episodes despite loving mostly everything. I became infatuated with the story of episode 1 and seeing the bar get brought back time and time again was a nice reminder. Then the story of the man at the raising canes rehearsing for a confrontation with his family member, and what transpired after really stuck with me. The ongoing story of raising a child and the shocking climax at the end of the season. All of it was unlike anything I'd ever seen, so going into season 2 I was ready for anything, but also just wanted to experience more like season 1.And after watching season 2, I wouldn't want it any other way. Season 2 of The Rehearsal is one of the greatest seasons of television I've watched. Yes it's partly due to the fact I've never seen anything like it, but also because I doubt we'll ever see anything like it again.It's an experience that really can't be put into words but it combines comedy with life and death issues that desperately need to be addressed, and watching it all slowly unfold is hooking, hilarious, but most importantly necessary to witness.Watching The Rehearsal makes Nathan for You feel like a pleasantly hilarious fever dream. Going from fighting out of handcuffs to avoid flashing minors in 2013 to the end of season 2 of this series... I mean I wish I had something to compare that to but I've got nothing. But whether it's intentional, real, authentic or not, it's some of the best character development you'll ever see. I never say this but I hope this show continues. If not, the ending was a perfect landing to a damn near perfect comedy/documentary/whateverthisisseries. This show brings me to life and I hope it does the same for whoever else gives it a try.",False
8,9,"""Next thing you know, I'll bring home some oranges and that will be Satanic!""",ryanpersaud-59415,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've long been a fan of Nathan Fielder (from both Nathan For You and from How To With John Wilson), so one night, I popped The Rehearsal on and could not believe what I was seeing.So, I stopped watching and decided to watch it with some friends and family. And, predictably, they fell in love with the show. You may not love the Rehearsal (at first), you may find it quirky and odd, but you will be unable to look away. This is easily one of the most unique and innovative shows I have ever seen. Fielder is an absolute master and just when you think you know where the season is going, it takes so many different turns.By the end, The Rehearsal goes from a fun social experiment to a profound, contemplative, and deeply human experience. It's a show that questions identity, relationships, our attempts at controlling the world...yeah, just watch it. It's amazing.",False
9,10,Another multifaceted comedic masterpiece from Nathan Fielder,thefendiprint,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love Nathan for You, then you'll love this. It's nearly the same in terms of vibe and layout, just with a new way to ""help"" strangers. He's once again proven he's a force to be reckoned with in comedy. Ignore the low ratings... If you get it, you get it. And those people clearly don't.",False
10,10,Comedy Magic,vgvczvk,n/a,16/08/2025,Wow. The work Nathan and the crew put into this is insane. Another comedy masterpiece from Nathan Fielder. I won't go too deep into what happened because I don't want to ruin the magic of just how well they did this.,False
11,6,I Wanted to Love It...,belpi615,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'll start off by saying that I really enjoyed Nathan For You, and Nathan Fielder's typical style of absurd comedy. I think in that context, Nathan's awkward, goofy character comes off as more lovable and misguided. But in The Rehearsal, it takes that same one-sided character and puts it at the center of the show.After watching the first episode, I had really high hopes that this would be another rather insane, hilarious comedy from the mind of Nathan Fielder. Unfortunately, by the second and third episodes, the concept deviated pretty far from the original outline, and the actual story arc dwindled to almost nothing. Episodes would pass by with little actual character development or story, and the pacing felt very slow.It seems like this show was trying to do a sort of Bojack Horseman-esque mix of existentialism, societal critique, and comedy, but ultimately was unsuccessful. I don't think anything in the last three episodes made me laugh, and I don't really see much depth to Nathan Fielder or the story. I heard people raving about The Rehearsal changing their lives, and how they couldn't stop thinking about it. After I finished the season, I couldn't stop thinking ""is there something I'm missing....?""I will say that I kept watching and didn't just give up partway through, and I overall found the show interesting. But I don't see any real profundity in how it all played out. I read multiple articles ""explaining"" the show, and didn't really see why the message seemed to stick with so many people. I think there were opportunities in this show to explore real emotions and existential thoughts, but it just didn't go there. I think it would have been really interesting to see Nathan's cold, calculated, awkward persona break down in a more human and relatable way, but it just never did. My sense is that Nathan Fielder probably isn't an emotional person, and genuinely does lack the ability to feel things deeply, which is why this came off as mostly fake-deep to me.It became a character-study of Nathan, who lacks depth, and so the whole show seemed to falter with the inability to actually cross the emotional, raw threshold that it seemed to want to. I wish that the show had either kept it light and comedic, as the first episode did, or really delved deeper. It seemed to waver between both ends, and ultimately felt very hollow to me.I suppose some could say that this is all the point of the show- that reality TV inherently is cold and unfeeling, and so we never truly get to know the characters as well as we think we do. But like... duh? I didn't need to watch this show to realize that, and I think it would've left much more of an impact if it did go into the uncharted, emotional territory that reality TV doesn't get right.Overall, I found the show interesting, and I like Nathan Fielder, but I don't think it's deserving of a 10/10, because it was neither funny, nor profound. I will tune in for the second season, because I do think this show has so much potential, but it just didn't land for me this season.",False
12,9,Synecdoche New York,ivannushu,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is where movie becomes reality, and vice versa. After helping with people's careers on Nathan For You, the wizard of loneliness returns to help with people's relationships.",False
13,6,"I can hear the ""OK Boomer"" reactions already",skeanie,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched 3 episodes and I can't think of a good reason to give this any more of my time. It's not terrible or offensive, I just find it pointless and not particularly funny. I'm not sure what exactly the likers find so brilliant that merits a 9.0 average, but this is neither the first nor best mockumentary I've seen. I'm not looking to insult anyone for liking this, I just don't think it targets my demographic, which is fair enough.",False
14,5,Can't watch,seraichyk,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am envious of people who find this entertaining. I find it excruciating to watch. This is a very specific type of ""comedy""..that apparently many people love. For me, it feels like there's a mean-spirited undertone. I've seen movies with a similar style. Almost reminds me of Sasha Cohen..there are people who aren't in on the joke. So the humor, I suppose, is in their eventual humiliation, when they realize what they thought was a serious interaction, is just a sort of joke with them as the subject of the humor. I find it so tedious and painful to witness. People who like it, seem to reeeeally like it.",False
15,8,Horrifying. But very good. This is stealth therapy disguised as something else.,Safetylight,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show has value as a cautionary tale. Nobody should live like this!This is exactly the wrong way of engaging with life; trying to control and micro-manage every possibility is based on fear and a lack of developed connection with one's instinct. People have instincts, and they can tell that something isn't real.I knew a guy who approached women in this way, hyper-studying the object of his obsession and planning flow charts of possible actions and reactions. It sort of worked for a while, but fairly soon, she reacted like a trapped animal. It was insanely frustrating for me to hear about this. ""No, no, no! Don't DO that. That's NOT how you interact with people. (What the hell is wrong with you??)""You have a soul. Souls are like surfboards. Trying to freeze everything to get it right is like trying to reduce yourself to a reaction machine. It's like trying to cheat god. It cannot last.HOWEVER...The point of this show is not to attempt success through the method of hyper-control.The point is to demonstrate the futility of trying to control god, and through the exercise, stealth-grow the subject's confidence in dealing with random events.",False
16,10,"Unique, Hilarious, and Thought-Provoking",CulvertonSmith,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nathan Fielder's new series The Rehearsal is easily one of the best seasons of television I've seen all year. As a big fan of Nathan For You, I couldn't wait to check out his new project. I was delighted to find that I loved it even more. As hard as this show is to describe, I'm going to try my best.Nathan Fielder's awkward comedy finds a new home when he tries his hand at providing people with an opportunity, an opportunity to rehearse important moments in their life. In the first episode a man must rehearse a confession that he will give to his friend, with a re-created studio set of a real location and a paid actor who portrays his friend.Sounds insane? It absolutely is, but in the most bizarre, entertaining, hilarious, and unpredictable way possible. What starts as a ridiculous premise that I found particularly hilarious, ultimately winds up becoming a reflection on its own structure that questions the ethics of the rehearsals themselves. The show gives room to laugh, become invested, and constantly pulls the rug out from its own audience in the most shocking and delightful ways possible.You are almost always aware of what you are watching, because the show doesn't let you forget what it is. I absolutely mean this in a good way, because that is how the show manages to be something so unique, by staying hilarious while reflecting on what its doing.It's impossible to fully sell the experience of The Rehearsal because at the end of the day, you have to experience it for yourself. I loved the first season of this show, and I highly recommend it if you want to watch a unique and extremely funny series unlike anything seen before. I can safely call this one of my new favorite series on television, and I can't wait to see what is explored in Season Two.Season One: 9.3/10.",False
17,10,What's just as fascinating as the show is...,krupocin-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Reading some of these reviews. It's really interesting to read some of the dissenting 1s or 2s on a show with a 9/10 average, it's funny how some people can just completely miss the concept. ""This isn't a comedy!"" as if there's only one way to do this. Everyone doesn't have to like the same things but there's no world in which this is a 1/10, just even considering the execution, originality, ambition, etc. Then again we live in a world where every moron has a voice now and 90% of new movies are people prancing around in costumes pretending to have magic powers so maybe I shouldn't be surprised. One of the low reviews hates the second half of Better Call Saul's final season, another loved The Gray Man but hated Sicario, another I assume is basically a real life version of The Simpsons Comic Book Man...so it's not like we are dealing with anyone you'd likely trust for recommendations but I still think it's really interesting, since I always wonder how some of the completely cheesey new shows on HBO Max or Netflix get picked up for second seasons and I forget how many mouth breathers are out there. At least the small audience who has watched this so far has loved it, and hopefully we get many more seasons. Along with Saul, Succession, Barry, a couple others, it's one of the few bright spots on TV at the moment.",False
18,10,"After the finale, easy 10",joshualholmberg,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn the end, I was so confused on what this show was and what it was trying to accomplish, as it strayed far from the simple (yet still amazingly complex) first episode. And yet even through the confusion came lots of emotion in what must be the most original tv series ever.",True
19,10,blown away!!,emme-29150,n/a,16/08/2025,"Please watch!! This show is not only funny but a brilliant commentary on modern day anxieties, making it extremely relatable. Nathan goes above and beyond in this show.",False
20,9,Season 2 was something,RannyDanny,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching season 1 with interest because of the novel approach to serious topics, I had some expectations about season 2 and let me tell you, it blew my expectations off the charts. The 6 episodes have an interesting continuity that takes you from ""what's this"" to ""is this even real?""
The topic of this season was a thousand times more serious than season 1, and you are drawn into questioning the next flight you take.Episode 6 is must see TV. The twist is worthy of an scripted series and its production is impeccable. From the storyline to the sound track sung by the winner of the contest, it's Emmy material.Refreshing and engaging TV. Absolutely recommended.",False
21,n/a,Best Show of 2025,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Season 2 proves once again that there's truly nothing else like this show on TV. Nathan takes the already mind-bending concept from Season 1 and pushes it even further and to such impressive ways.He seamlessly blurs the line between reality and scripted/ performance in ways that feel both hilarious and deeply unsettling. He is the kind of cringe and does awkward and uncomfortable better than anyone I've ever seen.His commitment to detail is also insanely impressive. Gotta give props to his art department. They nail every detail and it adds so much to the show.This show also forces viewers to reflect on their own social behaviors, fears, and insecurities, all while keeping you laughing at the absurdity of it all. Nathan is an awkward genius and I'm excited to see whatever else he comes up with.",False
22,7,"Interesting, but not real",pufca,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gotta say that the idea is brilliant, but unfortunately for me this social experiment was not actually real. Everyone were actors, including people who supposed to be the participants. It was pretty interesting for me though to watch it, except the fact that the whole time I was kind a worry bout the children, who were too little to make difference between real and not real. Never heard bout Nathan Fielder before, definitely like his stile, although I can see some selfish motives of his work. The line that hit me the most is, will paraphrase it: I often jealous peoples ability to actually live life and to know things only they need for.",False
23,10,Masterpiece. Period.,Stranger_Sins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nathan Fielder being Nathan Fielder again. After following his work since 2011-ish it's fascinating to see how he has evolved. Especially episode 4 is very intriguing.This is human psychology at its best.Think ""Truman show"", but real, to get an idea of what this is.",False
24,7,Weirdly creepy social experiment makes for compelling viewing,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As Episode 1 of ""The Rehearsal"" (2022 release; 6 episodes of about 45 min each) opens, we get to know Cor, who loves trivia and plays on a bar trivia team. One little problem: he told the team that he has a Master's degree, but he doesn't. Cor wants to come clean but how? Comes in Nathan, who is prepping Nathan how how exactly to do this, along the way building an exact replica of Cor's apartment and the Brooklyn bar hosting the team trivia...Couple of comments: this is the latest project from Canadian creator-writer-actor-producer-director Nathan Fielder (""Nathan For You""). Here he pushes the boundaries even more, by recreating the real world for purposes of rehearsing how things could play out beforehand. The amount of detail that Nathan puts into this is astounding, and frankly a little creepy. But I found myself sucked into Episode 1 as this social experiment, because this is what it really is, was playing out.Episode 1 of ""The Rehearsal"" premiered this past Friday om HBO and is now available on HBO On demand and HBO Max, where I caught it. New episodes will be released on late evenings US Eastern time. If you liked ""Nathan For You"", or simply are interested in a social experiment on human behavior, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
25,4,Interesting start and then...,cdc123,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCreepy show. Messes with very young actors' sense of self. First episode is good and gives you some hopeful anticipation that future participants will emotionally grow and have a cathartic experience. This says it's a comedy and documentary. It's a train wreck. Nathan's initial appeal diminishes with each episode until I find that he's lost more than he gained. And so do we. I hope there's not a season 2. If there is, I won't be watching. A good idea that failed to maintain the same level of interest on the remaining episodes. Amazed to see positive reviews for a disappointing series on HBO. This is an experiment that needs to be dissected and discarded.",True

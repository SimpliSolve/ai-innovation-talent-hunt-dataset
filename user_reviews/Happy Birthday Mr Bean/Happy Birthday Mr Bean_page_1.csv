1,7,Happy Birthday Mr Bean,studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA fun look back at the impact Mr Bean had, and continues to have, on comedy around the world, with contributions from all the key players who made it happen.Unlike the documentary years ago 'The Story of Bean' it doesn't get caught up too much in the life of Rowan Atkinson himself either.Good fun, but perhaps stretched at an hour.",True
2,8,A very fun and charming look back at the history of the legendary Mr. Bean character!,AhmedDaReviewer,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very fun and informative documentary about Rowan Atkinson and how he got to play one of the television's most recognizable comedy icons ever!Come on guys, It's Mr. Bean, Mr. Bean doesn't need an introduction, Mr. Bean has to be one of the most well-known comedy series ever to air on TV, I've always loved watching the original Mr. Bean as a kid and the show still holds up and I still watch it from time to time, It's great, One of the greatest comedies ever made.So when I saw this documentary about how it started all, I was immediately hooked, and this documentary didn't disappoint!It was really fun seeing Rowan and the writers and other familiar faces talk about how the show come to be and history behind some of the most iconic scenes and Mr. Bean's evolution through out the years, and yeah.. They about everything, The original TV series, The two theatrical movies (Mr. Bean's Holiday being my favorite) and the animated series (Does anyone remember that show) and it's just so pure and fun, From watching Rowan talk about his old college days and the characters he used to play before Mr. Bean was even a thing to him and writers reacting to some of Mr. Bean's most iconic scenes, It's just so Honest and fun.I'm kind of sad Rowan doesn't like playing the character anymore but.. I respect his opinion, I get it, He has been playing the character for like.. a decade now and I don't blame him for not wanting to make more Mr. Bean Sketches..And yeah.. That's basically it, If you like Rowan Atkinson and Mr. Bean, You'll like this documentary, Very fun, cute and short and sweet!HAPPY BIRTHDAY MR. BEAN!!!",False
3,7,Bean doc,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's some 30 years since ITV first broadcast Rowan Atkinson playing Mr Bean. It has his fellow contributors and longtime friends. I love Mr. Bean, the TV show. For me, he is a descendant of Charlie Chaplin's tramp. During the turkey scene, I would have thought they would mention the Friends copy. They could be nice and say it's an homage. Instead, they talk about it after they themselves repeated the joke in their own movie. I am glad that Row did say that you can't steal jokes.It's always fun to revisit these gags. It's nice to explore and dissect these jokes. The TV episodes remain the best of Bean. I've always thought that the movies were mistakes. I'm sure the money is good. I just love the original TV show so much and the longer movie running time saps out the energy of the Bean gag. I've never seen the animated show. I don't think that I can. If Rowan is willing, I would love him to dye his hair and do some Christmas TV specials. Thirty minutes of fun. That's Bean perfection.",False

1,10,The problems for Venice is fluid...,mpisa,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most informed travelers will know of the gates called Mose, but the future problems beyond this fix are literally quite fluid. This documentary gives a wonderful insight into the complexity of the existence intact, going forward for Venice and the millions of tourists that travel there each year. In todays world of high tech via electronics (DaVinci was high tech without electronics), it was interesting that use of the past can help identify the current and future problems faced by Venetians. I thought I knew what was the problem and that Mose would solve it, yet due to erosion the situation continues to evolve...it is quite fluid.I would recommend this documentary to all young and old.",False

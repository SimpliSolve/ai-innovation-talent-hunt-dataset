1,10,More than headlined,pontificator,n/a,16/08/2025,Although it starts on the racist trail it is much much more than that. In many ways it follows the traditional documentary format with at the time contemporary media repoerts and the protagonists speaking both then and now where I guess possible. It is an excellent potrayal of how the State conspires to use the police to implement its dastardly political agenda by effectively engineering a compliant and obsequious police state in my mind no wonder heralding the currenr regime of murderous and rapist police. The racial angel is followed by a through prtrayal of the miners strike. Great work by Riz. I always liked him and am glad to be proved correct. Actually I dont know what follows the miners strike as I was so impressed by it so far that I just had to comment...,False

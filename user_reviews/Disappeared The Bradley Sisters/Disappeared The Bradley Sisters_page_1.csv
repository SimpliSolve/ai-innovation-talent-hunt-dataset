1,2,Entertaining Lies . . . .,sundayatdusk-97859,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerUltimately, this documentary is a waste of time. Why? Because Detective Pam Childs, as well as many others, know good and well Tracey Bradley, the mother of Tionda and Diamond Bradley, was involved in their disappearance. Yet, throughout the film, most of the time she is portrayed as a poor grieving mother who is devasted by the matter.Garbage! That's probably where the girls' bodies ended up, too. Their mother and her boyfriend George Washington plotted to get rid of them, using a planned ""camping trip"" as the reason they were taken back to their home, instead of being left with their two older sisters at their grandmother's house. It was too expensive to take all four girls on the camping trip, they claimed!Their mother obviously has an obsessive, emotionally abusive relationship with her longtime boyfriend, and would do anything for him. The youngest missing child, Diamond, was his child and he did not want to pay child support. (Outrageously, she had named the baby after his wife at the time, and thought that was so clever to do so!) Maybe he promised to impregnant her again if she got rid of two of her girls. She did end up later having his son, too, and lost custody of him to his father!Kudos to the two surviving sisters and their great aunt who obviously weren't going to support anyone's lies. Yet even though it's obvious two individuals, without a doubt, are responsible for the disappearance of Tionda and Diamond, no one has been arrested and charged. At least the Chicago police should have thrown Tracey Bradley in jail for leaving the two little girls home alone. Or did they never get back home and were disposed of right after leaving their grandmother's house?Sorry, Pam Childs. There is no question you are dedicated to solving the case, but it all actually seems like a drama that is being stretched out as long as possible. Why in the world would you all go to Texas to see a woman who claimed she was Diamond Bradley, before getting the DNA results back? You even took Tracey Bradley who claimed she would know right away if this woman was her child. What drama! It's obvious who is responsible for the girls' disappearance and that they are dead.",True
2,2,Talk about fake...,QuackQuack,n/a,15/08/2025,"There is no way on Earth a family could lose two little girls, ""claim"" to have a copy of the voicemail that one of the little girls left them on the day they disappeared, and not turn it over to the police or Feds. It's a ridiculouse premise.To claim the voicemail still exists but the voicemail is password/code protected and they don't want to lose or delete it, is just insane.It's been 22 years! You won't let a technician from the FBI or Apple, Yahoo mail etc... try an attempt to retrieve? There might be some background noise, voices etc... (if it even exists) that the feds can pick up.It's a silly waste of time to watch this show. The aunt who says she has the voicemail should be arrested for sheer stupidity if nothing else.",False
3,1,LOUSY DOCUMENTARY,joycenka,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not only does it shed no new light on the disappearance of these 2 girls, it is a 1.5 hr regurgitation of previously known facts that are not presented in a very compelling way. The documentary (if you can call it that) is tedious and repetitive and calls into question the fact that this was not resolved 20 yrs ago. However, I can see why it went unsolved if the 3 detectives in the film were the primary investigators trying to solve the case. They seem ridiculously incompetent and I wouldn't trust them to search for a lost dog! Watching this was a total waste of my time. What could be the purpose of making this shoddy film and, more to the point, why did Max think it would be of interest to anyone at all?",False
4,10,Excellent Documentary,emailalicerubio,n/a,15/08/2025,"Aptly strings together the chronology of events that day to focus on the probable killer. I live in Chicago and remember this case! Still gives me chills! This podcast reflects the hard work the CPD did to try to find the girls. At the time, the media focused and some members of the public focused on race and the concept that the CPD doesn't do the work they should for certain communities. Detective Pam Childs is a great guide along with her fellow (retired) CPD officers. They prove how much the department worked to find the girls and the strain in their voices indicate how they were touched by the case - how hard they worked - and how it still haunts them. There's definitely a suspect and if someone hadn't lied (isn't that so often the case) he would have paid for his crime. Cold cases aren't cold at all - they burn thru the public's imagination and the hearts of cops. Hope to see/hear more podcasts from Pam Childs.",False

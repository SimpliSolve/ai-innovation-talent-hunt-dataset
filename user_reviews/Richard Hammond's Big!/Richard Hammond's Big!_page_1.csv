1,9,Richard Hammond plays to his strengths and doesn't disappoint!,jchristoffersen-40991,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis show is already from only the first episode look like to be another great venture for Richard Hammond. It is highly entertaining while it also shows off the massive Volskwagen Factory in Wulfsburg with a lot of informative bitesize chunks of information on the technological processes behind making cars, while keeping the whole thing centered around how the factory still employs 65 000 workers in an industry that has the public view that ""robots are replacing the humans"". He also showcases the more nich√© technologies like audiovisual tools to track wear damage in their huge machines before parts fail, all while again using the human element to keep the whole thing deeply grounded. 1 star has been deducted due to the rather boring and dated filming style, it would have been great to see this being shot with higher quality lenses and cameras to really show the beauty of the machinery, and not just LOOK like every other Discovery show, because everything else about this project is amazingly well written and executed. Well done to everyone who worked on this!",True
2,9,"Great show, but skip episode 9",BenW1999,n/a,15/08/2025,"Every episode is fantastic, but you can skip episode 9. Episode 9 it literally a recap of the previous 8 episodes.",False
3,8,Nice to binch watch in the evening,royw44,n/a,15/08/2025,Good show when you are interested in technic. Realy love this kind of series on discovery+,False
4,10,Really interesting show,ASG666,n/a,15/08/2025,"This has been a really nice watch, Hammond is like a big kid... Well little ;D",False
5,10,Much needed breath of fresh air,yarik83,n/a,15/08/2025,Richard is a perfect host for this show. He lights up like a kid for Christmas. Decades of presenting made him comfortable on camera. Show features huge things in which he conquers fears and braves the uncomfortable zone. Very informative and passionate,False
6,10,Love at first sight...,atoonians,n/a,15/08/2025,"Love at first sight, and I didn't even have to look up. Hamster, I am short too.I loved and absolutely enjoyed every episode of this show. The presentation of the material is straight forward. It's simple and understandable but yet very cleaver and informative at the same time leaving the viewer smart and satisfied.Richard, what is there to say about the Hamster himself that hasn't been said. He's great. I love it how he gets into what he's presenting, how he lights up like a child at the science fare or a child at the ice cream stand as he's learning about the stuff he's presenting.Live long and prosper Sir Richard, and please keep these shows coming.Your Yankee viewer.PS: It would be absolutely fun and great to have occasional cameos from the Capt Slow and the Master of Disaster every now and again.Cheers!",False
7,10,Interesting and well presented,whwhwhwh-07557,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm an engineer, and while I know how to make a phone (well, a small part of it anyway), I don't know how to make a stadium, a dam or a building. I thought this was very interesting and well presented.",False
8,6,"Interesting, but extremely scripted",0w0,n/a,15/08/2025,"The thing that 'Top Gear' did so amazingly is making an ENTIRELY scripted show, look like it wasn't scripted at all... and yes, Top Gear did it very well before the Clarkson era ended and the show became HOT GARBAGE...Well with this show unfortunately it's very very easy to notice that everything is scripted and ontop of that there's a few too many 'segments'. The problem with segments is that it completely breaks your immersion and concentration on what's happening, when the show flips over to the next segment... so instead of having Richard Hammond just walking through the entire VW Mega Factory, they instead chose to cut the entire show into easily 10 or more segments... this show would honestly have been much much better if they didn't do that, and instead just let Hammond loose in the factory with a camera crew and it would all be much more organic...Instead the show ends up being extremely noticeably scripted and it only gets a 6/10 as far as documentary programming goes... that's what this show is afterall: a mini documentary.",False
9,3,Big but far from clever!,cayates1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've only seen 2 of these - the Super Galaxy C-5M & VW Wolfsburg but a clear picture is evident.The problem is Richard Hammond.He lacks the insight & depth to offer anything of interest.Schoolboy enthusiasm never compensates for lack of knowledge.When I compare his efforts to what James May has done in similar situations like say Toy Stories you can see he's a rather mediocre presenter. Clarkson would also do it better.Presenters like Guy Martin, Ben Fogle & Freddie Flintoff rarely make the grade.I think the worst is Charlie Boorman.Who would do this well?I suggest Ant Anstead, Edd China, Jem Stansfield, Mark Miodownik perhaps even Jason Bradbury. Dick Strawbridge, though he's now pratting about with a French castle.I just reduced my rating from 4 to 3.",False
10,3,A waste of talent,bevyz,n/a,15/08/2025,Watch Richard Hammond and his film crew create a fine production and then hear it runied by the sound team who have this puerile notion that relentless heavy metal music is somehow connected with the heavy machinery being featured. The obvious result being that you can't hear anything that is being said.,False
11,5,Presenter and Music,davehall-20211,n/a,15/08/2025,Firstly I agree with others that Richard does not have the knowledge to present a program like this. Secondly do we really need the constant back ground music which sometimes drowns out the speech and the natural back ground sounds.,False

1,7,Live by the gun...,allused,n/a,16/08/2025,"A digestible 1-hour storytelling about ""The Pleasant Valley War"" which took place in Young, AZ in the late 1800s fueled by a family feud. Scenes shot on locations where the actual events took place. Director and actors interject narrative along with fictional re-enactments supported by factual events. The actual story is complex and occurs over several years - this film highlights the major events. This isn't groundbreaking filmmaking but it's a fairly entertaining representation of this history - an improvement over still-photos narratives or stock footage type documentaries.",False
2,1,Pure cringe,btw001,n/a,16/08/2025,"Truly one of the worst things I've ever seen. So bad I couldn't turn it off - I had to see it all the way through. None of these guys should ever appear in front of a camera. Ever. Not as an ""actor"" or as a ""historian"" explaining something. My wife laughed harder than I've ever witnessed when they had a ""shootout"" with cars driving by, air conditioning unit in the background, modern chain link fences...and these guys are running around all of this with their old timey outfits and wigs. They took a fascinating story and made it almost incomprehensible. The most interesting parts were mentioned in passing or explained in a roundabout way that sucked all of the life out of the story. Just shockingly bad.",False
3,10,An Integration of Excellent Movie Making,coachrad-985-841707,n/a,16/08/2025,"An integration of history and creativity, of documentary type interviews and awesome acting, of action and emotional interchange. All done in the year of COVID amidst the trials and tribulations of 12 Westerns in 12 Months! WELL DONE!!",False
4,10,Excellent Docu-Feature,kkiddkid,n/a,16/08/2025,A true story that is such a good blend of action and narration with a superb musical score that keeps you on the edge of your seat. A piece of history few people have heard of. One of Travis Mills best works.,False
5,9,When the Law is Limited in Handling a Deadly Local Feud.,liquidfruits,n/a,16/08/2025,"We may not know exactly why, but it happened and this true story, this deadly ""war"" is told in a very entertaining and interesting way.",False
6,10,Documentary/Informative/captivating,livesongentertainment,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the onset, beautiful scenery, great lighting and the perfect voice for narration pulls you in to what is quickly becoming one of my favorite western true stories. Commentary by the actors themselves predescribes each scene brilliantly. A story long overdue of America's deadliest battle. Travis Mills and John Marrs, along with great directing and brilliantly chosen actors for each role makes this movie a must see. A true story long overdue, finally told.",False
7,10,A tribute to spoken story telling of Arizona History,BatMa_am,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching this on August 27th and having a few days to reflect on the experience:
The Pleasant Valley War was told as a documentary but reminded me of sitting around a social gathering of those passionate about the history of the area. The actors not only portray the events but become those larger than life characters of the wild west.The mix of the modern day world with the respect of the historical events is outstanding. Having that connection to the past being able to walk the same streets, see where those events took place and where the movie was filmed. It is an experience of stepping back into the past.I highly recommend this movie, if you are not familiar with the history to become familiar with it. Then I suggest you re-watch it and fall in love with it over again.",False
8,8,"This ""War"" is a Win for the #12westernsin12months!",CarlaKidd,n/a,16/08/2025,"We have all heard about the Hatfields and McCoys and the Gunfight at the OK corral. So how do we not know about the deadliest blood feud in American History?! The Pleasant Valley War lasted nearly 10 years and best estimates are that nearly 50 people perished....yet the story has come close to being lost from history.John Marrs and Travis Mills have written and produced a film that works to rectify this oversite. Part documentary/ part drama, PVW is a powerful telling of best friends turned deadly enemies. Though complex, the story moves quickly and is easy to follow and strong acting in main roles brings the men to life.This is a very nice addition to Travis Mills' collection of work!",False
9,10,Educational and entertaining,steve-73348,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie documents a piece of Arizona history in an entertaining way that keeps the audience engaged in the historical timeline of the conflict. The directing and editing were excellent and the musical score fit the intended feel of the movie. I would recommend it to anyone interested in western history or just looking for something other than the plethora of CGI laden far-fetched action films out there.,False
10,10,Fantastic Movie / Documentary - must see!,frankharaksin_stagescreen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Starts with a great storyline, and adds multiple layers of historically accurate (and assumptive) information about the War via interviews and VO. Excellent at all levels: acting, score and post.",False
11,9,"Fascinating, Tragic Story",bikilathewarrior,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's stunning that so many people on both sides perished in this senseless feud. Mills brings this compelling story and fascinating characters to life, infusing a feature film with documentary-style narrative with panache and expertise. The cinematography is top-notch and the music sets a somber mood reflecting the events of this inexplicable tragedy...",False
12,10,A historical peice given a breath of life,vhanwalker,n/a,16/08/2025,"The narrative voice over, horsemanship, and dual character portrayals with 4th wall interviews made for an entertaining hour. Even learned a few things.Maybe a series should be made to expand on everything during that family feud.",False
13,10,Untold History,jpmills-35666,n/a,16/08/2025,"It always amazes me how many historical events have been untold in film. As someone who loves the Wild West and is from Arizona, this was a fascinating watch.There were so many unique moments in the telling of this true story, from the modern setting in a significant scene, to the cast/characters themselves being ""interviewed"", giving us commentary.If you are a history buff, a western movie fan, or just a film fan in general, I highly recommend giving this one a watch. Beautiful horse riding, cinematography, great acting, and, of course, a great story that has been overlooked for far too long.",False

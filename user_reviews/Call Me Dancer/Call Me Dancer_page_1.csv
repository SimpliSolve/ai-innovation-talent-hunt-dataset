1,8,Wonderful feel good movie,kollek-628-104144,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCall me Dancer is a documentary about a poor ballet dancer in Mumbai and his Israeli teacher.This is a feel good movie. There are beautiful moments of family closeness and friendship. Manish, the lead character, is charming. The story is sweet, a person pursuing his dream and his Israeli teacher on the way. The dance is -to my untrained eyes- wonderful and the story is uplifting.The film is not political, quite the opposite. Quote: ""I never say I am a Hindu and no-one said I am a Muslim or Jewish or something. We say we are dancers."" (Around minute 41)There are striking contrasts between the chaos of Mumbai and the discipline of ballet, between Western and Indian dance cultures, between classical and modern ballet.",True
2,10,Standing Ovation at the Milwaukee Film Festival - 2023,jrklett-25445,n/a,16/08/2025,"Call Me Dancer is magical and full of surprises. Manish, the dancer, is a genuine and charismatic star. His story is of someone having a dream, taking their shot, and maneuvering the highs & lows with grace. This taut 84 minute film was rich with universal humanity, centered on a hero's journey that made the audience feel all the feels. First time director Shampaine - a dancer herself - has directed a minor miracle that moves with the power of authenticity. The audience couldn't help but stand, applaud, and let out a few bravos. Manish QnA ruled! We could use more movies like this. Best of Fest.",False
3,10,Truly Inspiring,emilligan-11942,n/a,16/08/2025,"A wonderful inspirational story about following your dreams and the persistence it takes to accomplish them. This young man is a phenomenal talent and whether you are inspired by dance or not, his story is uplifting and well told. This film gives the viewer an inside perspective on the athleticism and durability required to make it to the highest levels of dance. In addition to one's natural born abilities, the film shows the importance of mentors and the support of friends and family required to sustain an individual in their quest to achieve their dreams. The young man featured in this film has unbelievable talent, but his character is as impressive as his physical abilities.",False
4,10,"From Mumbai to NYC, the possibilities of a dance star being formed",keslerpt,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a dance critic, dancer, choreographer and filmmaker myself, - and a physical therapist, I cheered, laughed, cried, and related to so many moments of this beautiful film. Following the story of the young, handsome, and incredibly beautiful mover Maneesh, who despite his parents misgivings, found his way to being called a dancer.The filming is spot on for a dance movie and more- Shampaine's camera work captures the subtlety of rippling muscles and dripping sweat on our protege's back, as well as the tears in his eyes as he leaves his parents; the tears in his mother's eyes as she accepts his first paycheck from being a dancer. This feeds both my appreciation of the beauty of a human body in motion, as well recalling the painful tension between my parents and I when I told them I wanted to dance. I know so many dancers can relate to those scenes!Shampaine follows Maneesh for over 5 years, and at the q&a , said she had no idea how his career would turn out. This mystery is apparent in the filming too- Maneesh looking out the window of a train, hopeful, scared, anxious- the audience feels it too, as there's no clear directions get to the opening nite of his dreams.His relationship with his Israeli dance teacher Yaakov, is also shown in a personal manner, and how being a teacher feeds his needs and ambitions too.As it turned out there was another male dancer, Amir, with even more beautiful feet, that rivaled his classmate Maneesh. But the story ends up focusing on Maneesh, whose circuitous path leads him to Israel, and New York. Maneesh as talented as he is, doesnt have an easy time of it- he ends up needing physical therapy at one point! He persists though,
gathering himself up again and again to pursue his dreams.It certainly was exciting to see my old dance teacher, Igal Perry, and the Peridance studio, my friend and dance teacher Lucy Bowen McCauley, and several of my dance friends in the film. I also saw it just a few days after the Oct 7 Hamas attack on Israel, so seeing a peaceful dance Kibbutz in Israel was a poignant and painful reminder of what has been lost this past week.But my enthusiasm for cheering all the familiar faces and places wouldn't have changed how I felt afterwards if I hadnt known them. Watching this film, I left feeling uplifted, hopeful, wanting to support this young dancer, as if I had known him for a few years too. Destined to be a classic film for dancers, artists, and all who follow their dreams.",True

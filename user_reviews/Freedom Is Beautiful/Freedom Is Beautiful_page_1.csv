1,2,Not the best made,ludaaa-96957,n/a,16/08/2025,Well i've seen many great TV documentaries about refugees but this one is more like fake propaganda then real struggle for real life they could have. It all look like premade narrative to make all more believable but in the end it can't convince viever. Its hard to watch it as instead of how sad stuff is going on there people may focus more of how it try to push vievers opion too hard. I think producer should implement also opinion of other side to make in more real. All in all i belive the potential of this kind of movies is wasted here. Also i think they should. After watching this i felt like my emotions were not directed enough with main characters nor towards Australians' government. Its like you watch it and forget.,False

Directed by Angus McDonald, the film follows their flight from Iran, through the years in detention, to finally being able to make new lives in Australia - albeit still not fully free.It is a story of finding beauty in the darkest days; of overcoming trauma to make space for art, hope and joy. As theyare filmed walking through rainforests and swimming in the ocean, Azimitabar says: ""My life was the size of a room for years and years.""",False

1,8,Really Funny Stuff,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is John Mulaney's first show since his personal scandal surrounding his drug addiction, rehab experience, and divorce. Following these tragedies he got serious with the amazing Olivia Munn, and had a baby. He seems to be past the worst parts of his life. This very funny and, sometime shocking, special is about the darkest times and more. He is painfully funny and honest about the darkness of the experience and his dealing with it. This is raw and honest and funny because it is authentic. Many comedians evolve from chaos and, quite honestly, are not funny at all. This is not true here. He is as funny as ever. Evolved as can be, but funny as ever. See this one, even if this is your first Mulaney special.",False
2,6,"Not bad by any means, but it's definitely his weakest Netflix special.",DougTheBrownieHunter,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's John Mulaney. He's funny. I laughed.But compared to his other specials? This was underwhelming.Not bad by any stretch and certainly worth the watch.Part of what I enjoy so much about him is that, yes, his stories are ridiculous and, yes, his takes are unique, but his ability to describe things creates such hilarious imagery that his humor can make use of. The variety of topics he'd hit in his first few specials were incredible and let that whole dynamic work it's magic.Here, he's still funny as hell, but he confined his material entirely to his addiction and recovery. That's totally fine in and of itself, since that's been his life in recent years. But the grim subject matter takes the variety out of the show, making it really monotonous. It was like an hourlong story with plenty of events, but it just kept going and going.I won't be able to rewatch this special. I'm a longtime fan and I hate to see him in this light, especially since I can't imagine him actually doing any of these things. Maybe that makes me more biased than average. Do with that what you will. Regardless, I hope we get more content like his previous stuff, except without his previous *sources of inspiration.*",False
3,8,"different man, but he still has it",swampmarsh,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerObviously he's in a different place now in his life, so there is a massive, noticeable change in his demeanor. He even comes right out and says it.I admit I was worried that this would somehow make him less funny. I was wrong. The man proves he is inherently funny. He doesn't need to be running around on stage to make his stories humorous.My only gripe is that at some points he pauses between phrases for what feels like an inordinate amount of time, almost as though he's trying to stretch things out a bit. A little off-puttingall in all, yeah it's a different vibe than everything else he's done, but in the end he is still very funny.",True
4,10,It's good to be unlikeable,valemas,n/a,16/08/2025,"This might be John Mulaney's most honest appearance to date. He comes off as arrogant, bitter and deranged... And it's great!I can honestly say it's the hardest I've laughed in a while. I've always liked Mulaney, and this turn into a darker comedy is unexpected but very pleasant. In allowing himself to be unlikeable he also allows himself to be relatable, more profoundly moving. I feel I am laughing with him, at him and at myself at the same time.It's also impressive how he manages to talk about rehab and drugs, and generally very heavy topics, while remaining elegant. He doesn't ressort to being crass, he's just a drier version of his former self.This special has made me excited for what the future holds for Baby J. He looks healthier, and I thank the 12 people who saved his life for the many years of chaotic laughter yet to come.",False
5,9,Former Addict Perspective: It depends on what you expect going into it.,isaacjdsv,n/a,16/08/2025,"I approached John Mulaney's ""Baby J"" with a different expectation, anticipating a profound exploration of his journey through rehab based on the clips I had seen. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself thoroughly entertained. As a recovered addict, I strangely found myself relating to some of the experiences he shared and understanding where he was coming from.Had I approached this special purely as a comedy show, I might have rated it a 3 or 4, as many of the topics Mulaney delves into are truly terrifying rather than humorous. Nevertheless, he skillfully weaves jokes into his narratives, creating a unique blend of darkness and laughter. I can imagine that those who haven't experienced addiction might feel uncomfortable or confused by his approach, but from my perspective, it strikes a chord deep within my heart.Mulaney assumes a sort of villainous persona throughout the special, leading some to claim that he seems detached from the severity of his past struggles. However, I believe this is merely his way of coping with the trauma he endured. As a recovered/recovering addict, I may be biased in my review, but every word he utters resonates with me on a profound level. I read a review suggesting that the reviewer couldn't fathom Mulaney actually experiencing any of what he described, and I find that notion incredulous. It seems that the reviewer fails to grasp the immense gravity of addiction.While I acknowledge that non-addicts might find great enjoyment in ""Baby J,"" I can only provide my perspective, which might be off-putting or uncomfortable for some. However, I view the special as a powerful message infused with dark humor from start to finish.",False
6,n/a,Not sure he is out of the danger zone,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kudos on whoever came up with that kind of production design and immediate opener for a standup special. It had really become boring to hear an announcer and witness the dude get on stage under applause. Both on technical and creative efforts, the visual aspects of this production are winners. The standup stands out thanks to how the ""man talking on stage"" is packaged.And about the content: Yeah, enough of a differentiator to have a drug addict's rehab story told from such a perspective. Mulaney's reactions to the interview he gave to GQ was a highlight. And there was other good stuff, like the exchange between him and the 5th grader among the audience. (Not sure if that was planned/real, or improvised, though).Still, there was something a bit off-putting, maybe even scary about the whole experience.Mulaney thanks the intervention 12 for saving his life. But does he really register how dark a place he was in?Certain remarks suggested he DID understand he was going to die of an overdose or of other physical outcomes of substance use. And it is totally understandable that, as a performer, he might intentionally avoid sharing on stage the darker memories and concerns he had had during the period. Also, no mention of his ex-wife looked like a marker on a personal level just to steer away from whatever caused his downfall.Yes, that was a downfall. Not as an entertainer, but as an organism. Regardless of how audiences may be lead to perceive substance use, it is a health scare for good reason. People die on that. And in huge numbers.As he told his story, I got the feeling that he was not distanced enough from his addicted self enough to make me say ""this dude is off the hook for good"".Not that I was expecting a direct delivery of the moral of the story, but I thought there should be more than that soft advice of ""Don't do it"" to that 5th grader, something addressing the similarly troubled adults in the audience.I just hope John Mulaney will not be in need of further interventions, and that the humor he found under the conditions can be replaced with healthier sources of inspirations in the future, regardless of the public enjoying such material or not.",False
7,6,I Just Don't Know,pattizz,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have always loved John Mulaney and his stand up. I just don't know what made me more uncomfortable. The fact that he's using a serious issue to make fun of himself or the fact that the audience is laughing along with him. I do not personally know anyone who has suffered addiction but I have friends who have lost friends or family members, including their own children. I'm sure they would find this no laughing matter. I'm glad John has good enough friends that recognize he had a serious problem and were able to pull together an intervention that saved his life. Not everyone is that lucky. Maybe his goal is to point out to people to watch for things that he did. Let's hope so.",True
8,9,Is this Mulaney's best show so far?,kofila,n/a,16/08/2025,"Quick answer? Yes. In my opinion it is. I have always been a fan of Mulaney's and he is a master speaker without a doubt. And that still stands. He is very smart and knows how to sell it. But what has changed? Well.. He did. There is no more jumping arround, no more dancing, yelling.. It is not like I didn't like that kind of delivery but this John Mulaney just feels more real. He was blown by the wind and a bit waethered. Something huge happened and changed the way he acts and Mulaney feels much more open and truthfull. And that to me is what stand up is about a lot. As a person who had some rough years fighting addiction, anxiety or depression I really can relate to the new Mulaney much more and it puts him in a different angle for me. Now I feel like I get him. Just like that watch shop in New York.",False
9,7,So I'm just gonna say what we're all wondering... IS sober John still funny?,orcinussr,n/a,16/08/2025,"The answer is YES (although differently so). Ok, okay.. Now I love Mulaney, I think he'll be long considered one of the greats - he's HUGELY fun and dynamic and of course wildly clever as well as hilarious (ya thought I better add that last one just to cover the bases) - Now, I would never want him to forsake his health for his art or selfishly so, for our entertainment and guess what? He doesn't have to because he's just as entertaining as ever and I couldn't be happier for the guy - I wish him well and look forward to many more specials over the years ( at least 3more than he would have had he continued down that path right? Haha, nah but I get it, trust me.. I get it)",False
10,10,Watch the whole thing,Brosephus,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a fan of John Mulaney for years. But on my first viewing of this special, I started it and then stopped it. His rhythm is different. His tone and manner are different. I felt guilty at the notion that I may have preferred him as a comedian when he was using. I thought more about it and something hit me. I needed to grieve the loss of who I thought he was and make space for the truth of who he is. I went back and watched the whole thing thinking I may just need a moment to be reintroduced to him. So glad I did. He'll never be the same but wow he's still hilarious and this time it's sustainable. This special is really insightful, honest and genuine. It's rare for a comedian to leave me both laughing and reflecting. Definitely worth the watch.",False
11,7,Had to give 7⭐,EverydayOwl,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would have given a higher rating if not for the seemingly endless ""Al Pacino"" phone call skit. That was not funny at all, and it went on and on and on. But everything else was really good. My husband and I had a lot of fun watching this. I think my favorite skit was when he ""misunderstood adult dating dynamics."" Don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just leave it at that. Probably not the funniest part of the show for most people, but it had me laughing hard. I think the Al Pacino bit is my only complaint.Some of these skits were pretty brilliant really, in my opinion. Some were too much of a stretch, but they still work if you're not a nit-picker like me.Not quite as good as Comeback Kid and the other Netflix one, but definitely not a disappointment in the least..",False
12,9,Laughed until I cried,dissipatedfog,n/a,16/08/2025,"I generally like John Mulaney's standup so was curious to see how he was going to talk about the tumultuous times he's had recently. It was thoughtful and showed that he's really worked on understanding who he is, but mainly it was hysterically hilarious! I sitting was at home by myself and laughed out loud with tears streaming down my face throughout the set. I definitely plan on watching it again very soon. One thing I've not liked about about his comedy in the past is that he can sometimes come across as a little bit snotty but that was not the case with this show, I think it's his best one yet!",False
13,7,Pretty good,wesleythegnome,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've watched all of his other specials, not because I favoured John Mulaney, but because I like having on stand-up while I'm focusing on work (I work with my hands). And Netflix has an endless offering of the genre.I thought he was decent to average - not laugh out loud funny, sometimes bordering on annoying, but clever enough and also never so annoying that it made me want to turn off the special. Perfect background television.This special felt different, because he's digging into a more raw and real place. He said he's finally fine with being unlikeable, but I'd say this is the first time he started being likeable. Not because he's a reformed person, but because he seemed more genuine. I don't mind an entertainer having a persona, but I don't know if John Mulaney ever managed to convince me of his.I think he's overall quite a bitter and tortured person, and hasn't suddenly become this way - I think he always was this way and is starting to give up on hiding it. But these traits tend to work for stand-up comedians, if they're self-deprecating or punch down enough, if they can successfully ride that line between bitter and acerbic wit.If he's like most addicts, there will probably be relapses. I hope he gets through them and keeps creating his art, and finds a real place of contentment one day. The people in these reviews who implied his addiction would be worth it if it made his comedy better - who needs enemies with admirers like these.",False
14,4,didn't like it as much as others did,bethcrim-03260,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen I came here to write a review I was surprised to learn that other people laughed until they cried. At the most I got a chuckle. I watched most of it (I think) until I noticed that my husband had fallen asleep, and he's a fan! I have no particular issues with the contact. Glad he found his sobriety. More, it just wan't all that funny, or at least as funny as he thought he was. The pacing was off. The bit about the intervention dragged on and on, could have used much more punch. The bit about ordering takeout from rehab was funny. Struggling to remember what else he talked about than all the drugs he used.",True
15,10,A great WATCH (iykyk),McEtheCoolest,n/a,16/08/2025,"First: So glad to see John doing well! I can only imagine the bravery it took to show himself authentically after such a tumultuous turn. He deserves all of his flowers for hilariously navigating addiction in a fresh way that still rings as John.Second: Solid stand up! There was indeed a ""wide ranging"" of material that really cracked me up! From intervention to GQ, I was entertained! Through the comedic delivery there were still some sobering moments where you can see how down bad John was and how uglier things could have gotten for him.Definitely watch! I'll be watching again. So proud that John is sober, wishing him all the best!A John Mulaney Stan

16,10,Baby J is back on the streets!,chasemiller-12524,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis has got to be the best standup special I have seen in a long time. John Mulaney takes the audience through the epic and hilarious journey of his drug use and sobriety. After all these years one would think John's material would become predictable. But, this couldn't be further from the truth. He brings a freshness to stand up that many seasoned comedians lack.Baby J has a unique flow and rhythm that I have never seen before in a comedy special. This keeps the viewer engaged with the show the entire time. The special had a cohesiveness throughout while still providing variety and ebbs and flows in the performance. Overall 10/10 spectacular performance and would definitely recommend anyone watch this masterpiece.",True
17,10,His best stuff yet,Lolly418,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have listened to Mulaney for sometime now. This standup was by far his best. It was real, it was raw, it was funny. I would definitely recommend watching it if you like stand-up comedy at all. He has clearly honed his storytelling skills.He talks about the elephant in the room in a funny, but real way. You can laugh with him, but also empathize with what he was going through.Don't worry, he does plenty of name dropping, too.Impressively hilarious. Worth the watch (no pun intended). ;-)Sorry, I have to hit a number of characters to submit this review. Even though something like this doesn't need a wordy review.",False
18,8,not really a stand up special,exxarkun78,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are looking for material like new in town or comeback kid you will be disappointed, that said I think this is a very good special. There are funny, touching , sad , embarrassing a whole gamut of other emotional moments woven throughout what is basically his TEDTalk. The Show very much in the vein of the late Carrie Fischer's wishful drinking and it feels almost like he's in therapy or the confessional unburdening himself showing he's ultimately human and has rough edgesDefinitely worth a watch is you go into it in the proper frame of mine where you will chuckle , ponder , and maybe get a sense of hope even if you dont have a lot of belly laughs.",False
19,4,Not that funny and I usually like Mulaney,pd-19490,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was not very funny and his pacing seemed off as well. This was his weakest special by far. I fell asleep towards the end. I get addressing rehab since it was so public, but there's really nothing funny about rehab and he spends the ENTIRE special on it. It's more sad than anything. I chuckled a few times and even then it was kind of forced. If it were me I'd make some self-deprecating jokes in the beginning and move on. He used to be a writer on SNL and has written some all-time great sketches. Not sure if the drugs made him funnier or if this was just a misstep and he'll return to form with the next one.",False
20,5,It's not bad but I guess I'm not yet used to the new John,bbeelam,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you are expecting another one of John's signature style of stand up special, you will be disappointed. But if you're expecting an hour and a half of recycled jokes from John's precious interviews about his rehab experience, an awfully repetitive and slightly boring stand up special, then you'd loved this.I feel like you have to never watch any of the interviews or read anything that John mentioned anything about himself after his news breaks during 2020 to find his jokes in this special funny. As someone who's generally looking forward to this special, a fan, finds this special to be disappointing.",True
21,4,A Special For The Ex-Addict That Never Stops Talking About His Glory Days,benmak52,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are worse specials out there.I laughed some, but the end left me thinking, ""Wow, wish I didn't spend my time watching that."".I didn't know what to expect going in, but it eventually just becomes exactly as my title describes.Apparently, in the past, he felt a lot of pressure to be and act a certain way, and he was sick of having to be so likable. But throughout the special, it's like that man wanted to alleviate that pressure through the most jarring overcorrection and personality remodel I've seen in the public spotlight.Glad he doesn't feel the need to be likable anymore - because mission accomplished.Hearing him prattle on endlessly about his drug days makes me pity anyone who ever did coke with him.",True
22,1,Where is the humor,Pnkprinses309,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen a criminal cheater decides to blow up his life and the life of a new born he isn't a comedian, he's a horrible human being. I didn't laugh once, I just seethed. I gave it a shot because I loved Mulaney before everything happened and rewatch those specials again and again. This isn't the same person. This is a villain.You can see his age has caught up to him. He is no longer a cute, sweet, young faced man who is nice to everyone because of fear of judgement. He has made horrific mistakes and now, based on this special, corrupted his entire life. Murder isn't funny. Encouraging others to get drugs from their doctor isn't funny. Mocking those who have drug addiction isn't funny.He is seriously mentally disturbed and shouldn't be a comedian. Or a father.",True
23,3,Bitter and not funny.,whydoyouactsostrange,n/a,16/08/2025,"My absolute least-favorite special of his by a wide margin. Look, there are worse specials out there. This isn't Dave Chapelle making 17 specials where it's just him defending JK Rowling and Louis CK (with ZERO jokes) or anything. But like Louis CK, there is very little self-examination or insight going on. It's just bitter resentment after bitter resentment. Mulaney comes off as ungrateful at every turn - as if he learned absolutely nothing from treatment. Honestly, the only time I genuinely laughed was Mulaney's interaction with the young child in the audience. There were a couple other stories I found interesting, but not funny. Just concerning and sad. What cemented this special as Mulaney worst-to-date was when he started talking about getting ""cancelled."" God, maybe he does fit in with the Louis CK/Dave Chapelle pander-to-the-right crowd better than I thought.",False

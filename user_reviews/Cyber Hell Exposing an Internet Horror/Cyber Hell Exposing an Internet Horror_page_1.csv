1,7,Insightful documentary piece on a sickening case! [+71%],arungeorge13,n/a,15/08/2025,"After Don't F*ck with Cats and The Tinder Swindler, Cyber Hell is yet another Netflix documentary that delves into serious cybercrimes. The victim list of this cyber-sexual abuse scandal is pretty huge, and the fact that young women and children are majorly involved makes it difficult for the creators of this piece to paint the complete picture. It is told primarily from the perspective of the media and some ethical hackers who spent months investigating the crimes and tracking down the key perpetrators - Baksa and GodGod.It is worth mentioning that the documentary is 60% sickening with all its immersive details (of the crime) and 40% thrilling with its investigative actions. The documentary never veers off course, focusing on the insights offered by the relevant people being interviewed (including a journalist who was also subjected to cyber harassment). The stylistic choices employed in the piece are acceptable, given it talks about the digital world and its eerie side. Texts are typed out as they are, apps are explored on the go, and location maps are shared for a greater geographical understanding. Cyber Hell is best watched without reading much about the case, as it offers the feeling of proceedings unfolding in real-time.",False
2,7,Parents Need To See This,PalmBeachG,n/a,15/08/2025,"As hard as it is to watch, parents need to see this. We all know there are dangers on the internet however this is just horrible and it only takes one click to ruin your child's life. And it is real - I can tell you that it is worldwide and it just doesn't happen to girls as I recently saw a news warning in Chicago suburbs where a teen boy left a suicide note describing the same exact thing that happened to him. When I first heard about it I thought how could this happen. Thank goodness the investigation took place and the biggest offenders were arrested but the after affects and more dangers are still out there.",False
3,7,It's a trap,kosmasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's harrowing .. the way it starts ... now of course, watching this and reading what is happening in a chat, you have the time to reflect, you hopefully also have the notion to understand that this is ... a rabbit hole or whatever you want to call it. You know the girl is digging her own hole by ""accepting"" the premises and just going with what she is supposed to do - to not be exposed ... it is really horrific, what some people are able to do (and get away with).This is a documentary about the dangers of the internet and how things (data) can be easily accessed or stolen. The important thing is not to shame and/or blame the victims. We all have done things and mistakes at some point in our lives. The way those ""mistakes"" get exploited here is really shameful.As are not just those who shared and made girls do things that should be private. Or only made public if it is consensual. Which nothing here is. We don't see anything explicit (things get blurred to protect the victims or whistleblowers) and that is more than ok.What is anything but ok: all the people who participated (knowingly) in this sick little group and not only paid for the suffering of others, but relished in it ... did this go anywhere? Did anyone actually was being accountable? If you don't already know how this ""resolved"" (I didn't) the documentary is here to answer those questions.It may be a bit too long, but it does work overall ... even if it is anything but an easy watch.",False
4,7,"Good story, bad music.",anettewangensten,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe title seems very shallow, but the music actually ruined the documentary.This is an interesting and important topic and I am glad they shine a light on it.There is an enormous problem with videotaping people without them knowing about it in South Korea. It seems demanding pictures and blackmail has become a problem to. This also speaks volumes of how woman are viewed. There should be better education about this in the country and I am happy to see they share the problem worldwide. This might help change how they act and see woman and in this case children over time. I am not saying all men are abusers, but enough are to make it a real problem.Only thing that actually made me take breaks was the music. It was supposed to build suspense I think, but it was very stressful. I was so stressed and annoyed I had to take 5-6 breaks from watching this short documentary. Not something I usually do.",True
5,7,Cautious interpretation of NTH Room Case,witra_as,n/a,15/08/2025,A serious cybercrime and sexual exploitation towards young girls that everyone should take notes. Choi Jin-sung brought cautious interpretation of NTH Room Case though kinda slow and predictable. At least the criminals were being exposed.,False
6,10,We need more like this!,soeprijo19,n/a,15/08/2025,"Deep and detail coverage of what happened in South Korea Nov 2019 until early 2020, known as Baksa and GodGod scandals. Young girls were being framed, harrassed and bullied online, forced to take naked photos of themselves and doing unimaginable things online. This semi documentary movie covers the topic in a thorough way from all perspectives involved. One thing's missing: perpetrator's perspective and why did he do it, but I guess the families involved were reluctant to make statements in front of the camera.Best 10/10.",False
7,5,Harrowing Case - Drawn out doco,e-jackson1985,n/a,15/08/2025,"Deeply disturbing case that all should be aware of.I just wish the case was told with less fillers (animations, slow motion walking, lengthy text message tappings etc). It led to a very slow tempo documentary.The fillers could have been traded for attention to the court case, the impact this case has made to modern society and legal implications of cyber crimes.",False
8,9,MUST WATCH,ThirtyOne31,n/a,15/08/2025,This is the best Internet topic in a while. A must watch for every teenager and for parents. Don't miss this. Watch as soon as possible without thinking twice.,False
9,5,Too much filler anime & emotional visuals,kiss_the_pussycats,n/a,15/08/2025,Detailed and well organized show. Would be way better if they cut half of the entire documentary and speed up the whole story. All the filler visuals killed the momentum. Would have been interesting to know more about what motivated these criminals.,False
10,10,Great documentary for sexual harassment awareness,linggomandre,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI really admire the way they brought this story. First 5 minutes, i could feel lot of anger because of the way perpetrators treat their victim. Next you feel bad for the victims, and how producers, police, and pers trying to catch this man is executed perfectly(editing, cinematography, scoring, and the interviewees dialogues).The overwhelming feeling ended when you see the perpetrators finally arrested. It's so satisfying. Online sexual harassment has been affecting woman for decades, yet very few of them have the courage to speak up because of the trauma. This movie successfully brings awareness to this kind of case, so our daughters can be careful, and we can teach our boys to stop doing this kind of thing( victims and perpetrators are both underaged)",True
11,2,POOR EDITTING,odavido123,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think it is a very interesting topic to cover. However, they used too many ambient background music, and pacing is very slow. I feel like it can be done better tbh.",False
12,10,Beautiful production documentary,ue-53660,n/a,15/08/2025,"The subject of this documentary may be hard to enjoy, however it is interesting and engaging. What makes this a little masterpiece is the stunning cinematography, editing, photography and set design. A classic South Korean little gem.",False
13,4,Excessive and incorrect use of music,yenmekubra,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I want to listen to the violin, I will open this documentary. The victims should have talked more. There is no reason why every event should be made into a documentary. Some are newsworthy, some have documentary value.",False
14,10,A Film That Should Be Shown As Part Of Every Schools Curriculim Worldwide!,silicontourist,n/a,15/08/2025,"A brilliantly researched and revealing film of one of the worst dark sides of internet life. The number of girls, around the world, who are victims of these disgusting perverts and sick minded scumbags is very likely in the millions. We all know (at least the more aware of us) that children are youthfully, and childishly, stupid and suffer from youthful ignorance; its a fact of life in the learning curve and development of the minds of children.If proper use of the social side of the internet was a constant lesson of schools, much of this cyber horror experienced by young girls/boys could be avoided. Its not taught though because adults and parents are to blame...""Oh! I don't want my child being shown filth like that"" is the usual outcry. The people behind schools are just cowards also!Show this to your children and help them avoid this kind of online horror!",False
15,5,Poor direction ruins the topic,windaluc,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a case that everyone should know and be alerted for. But the direction of this documentary ruins the topic. I feel they only spent two days to interview all the journalists in a decorated room. And spent two years to create awesome music and anime for it. They didn't even interview the criminals, the victims, and those chat participants. Those are the questions I'm curious about. Why did the criminal do it? What did the victims think when they receive the first blackmail? Why didn't they call the police? What did the chat members think? Did they feel guilty or happy watching those videos? All the questions are not answered in this long long film. And tbh I don't understand why they chose the journalists' view to tell the story. I think that's the least important part of the story.",True
16,10,10/10,mzenaguu,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved how this documentary highlighted one of the most widespread problems in our society or rather to say in our world, an irrefutable documentary, thanks to the director and everyone who worked to spread security and peace in the world.",False
17,3,Poor direction,mailittorahulj,n/a,15/08/2025,The documentary is about a vital case that everyone should know about. But it was really let down by poor direction. I finished it in multiple sittings and that says a lot with me being a huge documentary fan.,False
18,9,Good watch,merani_ali,n/a,15/08/2025,Its a good watch to create awareness among the people.I could not find any issue with editing or direction although could have been slight better.Social media chatting apps like whatsapp and telegram should restrict porn/nudity on their platform to prevent such activities happening.,False
19,4,Average film.,CDzunn,n/a,15/08/2025,"Could be said that this film explains everything in great detail, including some useless information that has no purpose other than to lengthen the program. There may be some details about the defendant's life that led to this, but no, just some random thinggy.",False

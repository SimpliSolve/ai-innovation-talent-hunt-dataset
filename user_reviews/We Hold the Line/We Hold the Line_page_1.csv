1,10,This is worth your time,roundup-30747,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is an excellent piece of journalism. You see Duterte at length, threatening journalists doing their jobs. You see men (and a woman) describing how they were hired to kill alleged drug dealers, and how they carried out the killings. In some cases, police were accused of doing the killing.Extrajudicial killings are not new to the Philippines. Police and the military in earlier times were linked to the killings of leftists and other opponents of government. UN Special Rapporteur Philip Alston investigated in the Philippines and published a report in 2007.It's a serious risk being a serious journalist in the Philippines. The ones who stood up to Duterte are to be commended.",False
2,1,Just their side,pataysaya,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is just their side of the story.Filipinos adore Duterte because of toughness against criminals. 9/10 Filipino will side with Duterte. Philippines is a better place with the former Duterte Administration. Filipinos will still flock for him and is appreciative of his efforts in bring this drug problems at absolute halt. For those trying to bring down this country, there are still people that will be demons doing the dirty deeds just trying to protect the innocents.When it is in the context of the law and is executed against you it becomes so-called ""Weaponization of the Law"". Just hilarious. Plain stupidity.",False

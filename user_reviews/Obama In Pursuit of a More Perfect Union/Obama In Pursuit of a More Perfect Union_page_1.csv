1,8,Decent documentary,ckwqtngk,n/a,15/08/2025,A good watch for anyone who likes political documentaries. I'd suggest ignoring the 1 and 10 star reviews as they're so politically motivated. It's a decent watch to see some pieces of history.,False
2,8,A very good documentary about our recent history,lectureral,n/a,15/08/2025,"Viewed objectively this is a very good documentary about an important part of recent history and the 1 star reviews are ridiculous and obviously politically motivated - as some other reviewer said, I am doubtful that many of them watched it at all.There are so many false tales about Obama - that he ""was the worst president ever"", that he was ""selected by the establishment"" etc - and this documentary shows them for what they are. I guess some people do not want to have their prejudices disturbed.",False
3,7,President Obama didn't face the most hostility,ConsDemo,n/a,15/08/2025,"I struggled with rating this one. I suspect many of the low ratings and negative reviews come from those who didn't watch the series and just representing their partisanship. However, the series is a mixed bag.In a historical sense, particularly when discussing President Obama's upbringing and early years in politics, the series is very informative and contains footage I don't recall seeing previously. However, the last episode, which focuses on his time as President, I think misses the mark. The subtext is that much of the hostility towards Obama is race-based. Undeniably there is some truth to that, but the assertion misses a bigger reason, which is hyper polarization.No Presidency is devoid of vitriol, but it has gotten worse in the last couple of decades, especially since the early 1990s. Since Biden's Presidency is still ongoing, I'll defer judgement on it, but Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump faced intense backlash and I think one would have a hard time making the case that Obama had it worst. Both Clinton and Trump were impeached and had special counsel investigations, Bush left office unpopular and with is legacy tarnished. Now, to be clear, one can argue much of that was brought on by their own actions, but the fact remains that Obama emerged in pretty good shape relative to his contemporaries and that isn't something the series acknowledges.",False
4,9,"Nuanced, so{m}ber look at the 44th President",paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Obama: In Pursuit of a More Perfect Union"" (2021 release; 3 part documentary totaling 306 min.) is a in-depth look at the life and times of Barack Obama. As Part 1 opens, it is ""March 18, 2008, Philadelphia"", where Obama addresses an audience explaining why and how his path is to ""pursue a more perfect union"". We then go back in time, and get an overview of how his parents (African man from Kenya, Caucasian woman from Kansas) met, and the many different countries and places Obama lived during his childhood and youth... At this point we are 10 min. Into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from producer-director Peter Kunhardt, whose prior work includes the excellent ""King In the Wilderness"", among many other 'political' documentaries. Here, just in time to coincide with Obama's 60th birthday, Kunhardt takes a look back at the life and times of Barak Obama. Part 1 runs from his upbringing to the moment in 2007 that he is seriously considering a run for the Presidency. A couple of things are striking, most of all Obama's diverse background and upbringing. But also the ambition to strive for bigger and better things (not necessarily more money--of all the job offers upon graduating from Harvard Law, he picks a small civil rights firm in Chicago). And then this: the civility with which politics were conducted. Amazingly, we are talking just 15-20 years ago. For reasons unknown (which I suspect will be addressed in the documentary's Parts 2 and 3), Republicans disdained, if not outright hated, Obama. Why? Because of his name? Or the color of his skin? I suspect that as the years go by, Obama will be viewed more and more favorably, in particular when put into context and contrast as to who succeeded him: the thug-like and racist (if not fascist) Liar-In-Chief who tried to overthrow the US Congress simply because his mammoth-size ego didn't like the results of the presidential election. No, really.Part 1 of ""Obama: In Pursuit of a More Perfect Union"" premiered last night on HBO and is now available on HBO On Demand, HBO Max, Amazon Instant Video and other streaming services. Parts 2 and 3 will air tonight and tomorrow night, respectively. I am very much looking forward to watching them. If you are into politics, regardless of your own political persuasion, I'd readily suggest you check out ""Obama: In Pursuit of a More Perfect Union"", and draw your own conclusion.UPDATE 8/4/21 I've now seen Part 2. Which covers when Obama announced running for President in early 2007 through his swearing in as President in January 2009. Fascinating stuff. Not only how he overcame the Clinton campaign but also for the first signs of the ugliness of the race-baiting and outright racism that started cropping up with Sarah Palin being the VP nominee (and years later ultimately resulting in Trump).UPDATE 8/5/21 I've now seen Part 3, covering Obama's 8 years in office, mounted by a wall of resistance of the GOP in every which way possible. It is sickening to watch in retrospect, as the GOP relentlessly keeps playing the race card at every opportunity and in every which way, as Obama keeps the hope for ""pursuing a more perfect union"". It sadly leads all to, yes, of course, Trump. Watch Obama's very last farewell speech in January, 2017. If that doesn't give you the chills, I don't know what will.As a complete aside, the GOP detested and hated Obamacare, and tried to derail it time and again (only to be held up by courts). Time has shown it is widely popular with many Americans, ironically benefitting many white lower and middle class who railed against Obama, vowing to ""take our country back"" and ""make America great again"". In the 11 years since Obamacare, the GOP has not once proposed an alternative. NOTHING. For shame.",False
5,10,Absolutely wonderful,sorin-440-836870,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen so many quality people confirm the beauty of the character of President Obama is impossible to still have reserves. They are trusful witnesses, not easily or frequently appearing in documentaries. In addition, it is very relaxing to see and meet the high-quality persons who surrounded him in a lifetime.I specially admire his openess and ability to go deeply in debating ideeas with other open and clever minds and healthy mindsets.Chapeau Barrack Obama!",True
6,10,Best President in American History Honored,leftbanker-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Obama was more intelligent and a better man than anyone who's been in the White House in a long time. Period. His detractors can't argue this, and they hated him for it. They would rather see Obama slandered than see America progress in any way. What strange patriots.I loved this president and this documentary is more a celebration of the intelligent people working with and around Obama. Compare his people to the yes-men morons in Trump's circle, or the war criminals telling GWB what to do at every step. Obama continues to be a shining light and an example of American greatness, while Trump is still saying the election was rigged liked Captain Queeg and his strawberries.What really drove conservatives crazy about Obama was that they could never get any dirt on the guy. They talk and talk about family values and whatever, meanwhile they elect a human pig who was married three times, paid a porn star $100,000 to try to shut her up, and said on TV that he grabbed women by the crotch. Obama has a wonderful wife and two great kids, his administration had zero in the way of scandals. Zero. That's why conservatives lost their minds over Benghazi because they finally thought they had something, but after a ridiculous investigation that was longer and more expensive than 9/11, they found zero again.Conservatives spent so much time and energy trying to make Obama fail. They didn't care if what they were doing wasn't in the best interests of the country. How do I know this? They said so. All the cared about was making sure he was a one-term president, even after he inherited the disastrous economy Bush left behind in which we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs every month. Then they immediately started screaming about the national debt, something that didn't trouble them when they started two costly and ill-fated wars.",False
7,10,Watch it!,asatornkvist,n/a,15/08/2025,Fantastic and informative! Obama is such an impressive person. The world needs politicans like him.,False
8,9,The interviews paint a complicated and insightful picture of our first Black president.,pjames10,n/a,15/08/2025,"What can I say other than thank you for creating a doc that presents Obama from how others see him. And that is the most truthful thing... how others see you. And not just those who champion him, his detractors and critics get their turn. At the end of the day, a remarkable achievement. All presidents and powerful men deserve this treatment.",False
9,9,Must Watch Doc!!,justinbrizendine,n/a,15/08/2025,"This doc could easily be labeled as partisan trash, and I've noticed it has. But only because of the partisanship of the haters. This a comprehensive doc(made by HBO too btw) about the first black, two-term president of the United States?! No need to puff it up any greater than it was/is to begin with. There are extensive interviews from journalists, scholars, civil rights activists to name a few. Anyone who enjoys a great history documentary will love this.",False
10,9,Haters Beware!!!,chrissso,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a great documentary ... about a great president!It cannot be denied that the first African American president would need to be a great man ... much like the first African American major league baseball player (let's hope you know who that was). Simply put, it's not an easy row to hoe and you need the greatest courage and convictionLet's be real ... BHO is a great person ... a great human being ... a person who lives to make the world a better place ... and most importantly a person who lives a moral life. To be honest he is the man they told us in Sunday school to emulate ... he is in fact a great ""role model.""Haters should know that this is not an unbiased documentary. It is a puff piece that admires the man for all he has accomplished and all he aspires to be. That said ... those with closed minds ... those with prejudiced minds ... should go and watch something else because they will not like what they see. So why watch it? Why make yourself angry? Why make others angry?In the end this documentary must be judged as a ""puff piece"" about a man that is not only historically significant but is greatly admired by a huge number of fellow Americans ... and I for one loved it!",False
11,10,Superb honest and moving,stuartredsell,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thought this would be some run of the mill . Documentary . But gave a go as nothing else on and president obama has always intrigued me
Well 5 hours later , I have to say this was one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It shows his failings. His struggles . His optimism. And all of it documented by people who knew him. And are very honest, good and bad on him.I think this show has set a benchmark for how documentaries should be made . And I implore anyone who has not see. To watch as like him or hate him. We have lived through and witnessed a once in a life time event . Just like people 70 years ago witnessed ghandi .I'm confident you will not be disappointed and will definitely be educated .",False
12,10,One of the most inspirational documentaries I have ever watched.,casink-48028,n/a,15/08/2025,"On the days when it seems the whole world h;as gone crazy and those who are filled with hated and are determined to destroy America, I now simply think of this documentary and I feel a rejuvination and determination of my own, which is to keep trying to protect America and help her be strong regardless of what hte haters of President Obama do or say. America owes President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama a debt of gratitude we can in part repay by following their examples of how to be honorable American citizens and human beings. We never had it so good when they were in our beloved White House.Thank you to everyone who had a part in creating this wonderful documentary. May God bless you.",False
13,10,Made me love Obama even more.,MichMovieCritic,n/a,15/08/2025,"""My story is not possible in any other nation."" That line pretty much sums it up for me. Great documentary about a great man.",False
14,9,Compelling Doc On The Improbable Rise Of A Historic (And Polarizing) President,zkonedog,n/a,15/08/2025,"The story of former President Barack Obama is a fascinating one, to say the least. He seemingly came out of nowhere to become Commander-in-Chief, then was the first black President who largely refused to engage on the subject of race during his administration. He was also the first President to be completely and utterly scorned by both an opposition party and news network. This documentary hits on all those cogent points (and more) while examining both the facts of Obama's life and the legacy he left.""In Pursuit of a More Perfect Union"" is split into these three episodes:1- Obama's childhood, teen/college life, and political aspirations
2- Obama's entrance into public political races and ultimately the 2008 Presidential campaign
3- Obama's eight years in the Oval OfficeI found the first two episodes to be absolutely excellent, as the story of Obama's background is one that often gets a ""bad rap"", so to speak. In very clear and factual terms, ""Pursuit"" spells out exactly where he came from (including testimonials from fellow schoolmates and acquaintances) and how/why he decided to get into public service. Before watching ""Pursuit"", I had little idea what a ""Community Organizer"" was, but here I was helped to understand what that means in an African-American community.The only reason I can't give this 10/10 stars is because the final (third) episode really narrows the focus to areas that weren't as compelling to me. Essentially, the story of Obama's rise to political relevance was really the draw in ""Pursuit"", and once that happened the final third couldn't quite keep up.I know that many won't sniff this documentary seeing the political polarization that ironically largely started with the first Obama administration, but that is a shame. ""Pursuit"" certainly contains some figures in Obama's story that have been considered very controversial, but simply by interviewing them one sees their human side and not the toxic rhetoric heaped on in the moment.While this doc is obviously pro-Obama in the overall sense, it also doesn't give him a ""free pass"" or fawn over him the whole runtime. His shortcomings and warts (the legitimate, factual, and thoughtful ones) are also discussed. As such, I found the passage of time since Obama left office to be a great ""buffer"", of sorts, for a doc like this to be produced and thus able to dig deep into certain issues without the in-the-moment political repercussions.",False
15,10,Shows the historic complexities of Obama's presidency,siljeeg,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you one day feel you have lost faith in people and feel anger creep in, you should watch this documentary.What stuck with me most is the heartfelt vision to serve the american people above all else. To unite people despite differences and use those different voices as a tool for positive change. A man who loves people and has an amazing faith in what we can achieve.",False
16,10,Greatest documentary,mbizzle-78517,n/a,15/08/2025,This is the greatest documentary ever! End of story....,False
17,10,The human behind the Toughest job.,pavangiri-65332,n/a,15/08/2025,"Was never a big fan of Obama but always had my admiration for his speech. Felt he could have done a bit more to the job market then but now I understand the hinderance he faced to bring the change.This documentary showcased us what made him the man who we all see from far, the challenges he faced and the mental fabric he possessed and the poise he carried while setting an example that a colored person can hold the highest level of office with the required dignity and capability.He never had it easy and he never let any challenge passed at him to go by without turning that into an opportunity.Any man with less moral obligation or ethic or incompetence would have given up easily but his growth trajectory and the precedence he has set is remarkable. Huge respect and love.",False
18,10,Inspiring !!!!,Sunillokumal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Inspiring. Watching it a second time with my twin brother now. President Obama is one of the greatest presidents of all time, maybe the greatest. He has shown pure determination, strength, courage and honor. He is perhaps the most honorable president. He is pure honesty and does not have a corrupt bone jn his body. He makes all of us want to be more than what we are. I won best extemporaneous speaker when I was at school. President Obama puts me to sham e- I wish I had his eloquence.",False
19,9,Well done,BruceBali,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was a multi-part documentary following the life of a excellent President. Image a president with NO scandals! He made his way in the world and instead of using his law degree from Yale to make lots of money, he used his background and education to help people. Even after his presidency ended after 2 full terms, he still is helping people. Wonderful man. (Comment another review was obviously written by someone who hates Obama (and maybe blacks in general), and should be removed)",False
20,10,Most inspiring series on great leadership journey,saravananmanavalan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Perfectly describes and how each and every obstacles crossed and comes to the limelight. It's an extraordinary journey. Inspiring one. Barrack Obama, Good son, great father and excellent leader.",False

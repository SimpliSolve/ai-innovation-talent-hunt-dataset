1,10,"Who are you, really?",JFHunt,n/a,15/08/2025,"Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like It's A Wonderful Life.Does it take me back to that place in my heart, that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again? Does it remind me of my childhood, Christmas in my home? No. Maybe it's just simply what I always wanted from life and every man I want to be.Everything about this film is well for lack of better words, perfect. No question to it any longer, the best performance by an actor I have ever seen. It's more than just beautiful, timeless or fair. All of Stewart is revealed. Everything coming together for Capra. Lionel Barrymore at his best, which seems to be his worst.Sometimes I think there is a reason why somethings happen. And I'm pretty sure there is some magical reason why this film was made. I'm 27 years old and saw it for the first time Christmas Eve of this year. I've watched it 3 times since. The only movie to ever make me cry. I probably wouldn't have all the answers for you, if you asked me why. I'm still trying to figure Stewart out and just how beautiful was Reed.What can I say? This movie is a life changing experience.Makes me feel good to be alive. What a wonderful little world it is. And if I waited my entire life, it would not be a waste of time.",False
2,10,One of the greatest movie ever made in cinema history!!,jon-larsen,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I heard about this movie for the first time, I thought it was just a forgettable and funny movie. But I was wrong. I saw this movie last Christmas and I did not find it funny, but I loved it, though! Everything is so great in this movie. The story is amazing. The characters are great, and the character's development is fantastic! the cinematography is grea, and the acting is fantastic. James Stewart was mind blowing. The whole movie is amazing,touching and encouraging. You cannot describe how good this movie is. Nor can you describe how good the message is.This is the best feel-good movie ever. It's a life changing movie, actually. It makes you feel good to be alive. Do me a favor and watch this movie as soon as possible! When you're sad, think about the message this movie delivers, because you will get a smile on your face! I'm 14 years old. My English is not very good, but I hope this review was useful!",False
3,10,A Great Influence...,Coxer99,n/a,15/08/2025,"No movie ever made has influenced me more than this classic. I had the honor of doing a play version of it about 5 years ago. I had seen the film thousands of times, had loved it, but I never really knew what it meant. During the course of the production, I suddenly felt alive. I felt that I wasn't having enough fun. I felt that I wasn't doing enough in my life. Crazy things, like kissing my mother or my father. I hadn't really hugged one of them in a while. It makes you think. It's more of a thinking person's film than a mere Christmas film. If you think it's just a Christmas film, I insist you watch it again and again, until you get the message.Stewart gives the finest performance of his career, in one of the most difficult characters ever portrayed. A character all of us are familiar with...a person looking to find himself/herself. It's the great struggle for finding what it is in life you really want to do. George Bailey teaches us so lessons throughout the film and in the end he teaches us the most important lesson of all, that life, although a long and winding road, truly is (for lack of a better word) wonderful...",False
4,n/a,Atop my Top Ten,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a film lover from 'way back, having even served a stint as a newspaper movie critic. Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include ""Fantasia,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""North by Northwest,"" and ""The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is ""It's a Wonderful Life.""I have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.I cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as ""...the richest man in town."" The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.The performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small-town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.Capra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen--before or since--more natural-looking onscreen snow.Watching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not. Its message--that each one of us is important and has *something* to contribute to the greater good--is one about which the world could use some reminding from time to time.",False
5,10,"""To My Big Brother George, The Richest Man In Town""",bkoganbing,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the ""richest and meanest man in town"", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save.Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you.And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.",False
6,10,It's a Wonderful Life,auuwws,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOne of the best family movies I have ever seen, the storyline is amazing and puts hope in your heart. When the movie is over, when you feel useless in life, watch the movie and your thinking will change and you will know that you have a positive impact on the lives of the people you know. The events of the film were fun. The characters of the film were good. Two characters were prepared, James and Clarence. They were very interesting characters and I really enjoyed watching them. The end of the film is one of the best movie endings in history. I recommend watching it especially the black and white version. The black version is better than the color version.

7,10,A Wonderful Film and Timeless Classic,FlickJunkie-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family.  We watch it every year and never tire of it.  Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values.  This is probably his greatest film in that regard.  Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town.  The second message is that each life important.  No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.Capra's direction is brilliant.  His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters.  He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition.  He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow.  For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job. Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero.  Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational.  The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming.  Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town.  Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century.  It was nominated for five academy awards and won none.  It was swept in 1947 by `The Best Years of Our Lives', a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.  I can't wait to see it again this Christmas.",False
8,10,IT'S NOT OFFICIALLY CHRISTMAS SEASON UNTIL I WATCH THIS MOVIE,brianlion,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am so glad Frank Capra had a vision to make ""It's A Wonderful Life"". I'm glad he chose Jimmy Stewart to play George Bailey. There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" still hold true today. Yes, I'll say it, it's a wonderful movie.",False
9,9,Best feel good movie ever? Quite possibly.,Aidan McGuinness,n/a,15/08/2025,"Here's a new definition of cold-hearted: a man or woman who remains completely untouched by the 1946 Capra classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"". You can't not be moved by this wonderful little gem.The acting is all great. One of the film's greatest strengths for me is making George Bailey - the star of the movie played by James Stewart - a nice normal man. He's not perfect and that's pretty much essential to the film's success because Bailey could be *any* man. The lesson of the movie is fairly simple - we all have our role to play in the world and we are all important. Most movies would make this into a schmaltzy affair but Capra delivered a touching, heart warming tale. Bailey consistently denies himself to allow others to live as he sacrifices his life to make sure people can have enough money to avoid having to sell-their-soul in debt to the evil H. Potter (alas not a Harry Potter...). His complete and utter humility is great - he doesn't see how much he accomplished until his guardian angel Clarence shows him. Again Clarence isn't played in the usual clichéd manner but more as a believable character who honestly loves Bailey for his strengths.The movie is a success because you can't but want Bailey to succeed. The manner in which he does could be classified as corny but, because it's so deserved, that doesn't matter. The music, the set pieces, all the touches add to a wonderful movie and give you hope that life can indeed also be wonderful. A lovely mood-lifter. 8.8/10.",False
10,10,A wonderful film that should be watched again and again.,PyrolyticCarbon,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of the best films of all time, without a doubt. I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!James Stewart is one of my favourite actors, and in this film he acts so naturally you even forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film, and by no means is this a light hearted look at life, as many believe. This is not a rose tinted look at the wonderful life we have, this is a dark, downtrodden start to a film where the lead character is about to commit suicide.However, it is a beautiful film, and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it.",False
11,7,"Capra's most cynical movie, and why he's right.",Irene212,n/a,15/08/2025,"Criticizing It's A Wonderful Life is almost an act of treason in this country, but if ever a movie deserved a closer look, it's this one.Far from being a celebration of the importance of the individual, or of small-town life, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" depicts most citizens of Bedford Falls as timorous weaklings. Moviegoers identify with the hero, George, of course, but he's the exception in this movie, not the rule. If any general lesson is to be learned from the story, it's that a willful leader is the only thing preventing ordinary small-town folk from losing not only prosperity, but morality.The evidence is plain: Without George Bailey to hold the town together, it becomes Pottersville, which is a Hays Code version of Gomorrah. The townsfolk haven't got the courage or sense to manage their own affairs without a leader. In Bedford Falls, that's either corrupt Potter or long-suffering George. The only other characters with any backbone are Harry Bailey and Sam Wainwright, and they both left town. What remains are virtual ciphers like Mr. Gower, Uncle Billy, Ernie, and Bert.America doesn't exactly burst at the seams with self-reliant citizens, according to Frank Capra. So why does this movie merit a healthy 7 rating? Because it has undeniable power. Capra was a good director-- but a great propagandist. He made patriotic short films for the U. S. Army from 1942 until 1948-- and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was made in 1946, smack in the middle of that period. The film is a masterpiece of manipulation. People love it, watch it over and over again every year, never noticing that its real message is deeply cynical, presenting little hope for mankind, and almost no faith in it. Indeed, it is almost fascistic in the way it champions the idea of a single leader (or worse, divine intervention) taking charge over ineffectual ordinary middle class people. Capra is skilled enough to make generations of Americans cry and cheer at his movies, no matter how much he insults us.",False
12,10,"I laughed, I cried, and I smiled.",salemalissa,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wonderful acting with an outstanding story, if only its possible to show this movie to everyone who is feeling down at the moment because of financial issues.People sometimes forget that small good deeds always pay off and that's always better to be known as a nice person than a bad person no matter what.",False
13,7,Depressed about how your life turned out? Watch this film,msaz12,n/a,15/08/2025,"Reminiscent of the story of Scrooge of A Christmas Carol, the movie in itself is predictable and slightly less haunting. Similarly, the center of the film is also focused on the Christmas holiday, making it much more dramatic because contemplating suicide on a night where everyone is celebrating is such an irony. Throughout the film, you feel powerless for George, as if all the world's problems continue to fall unto him, a character that most people can relate to regardless of age or generation. Dreams come with sacrifices.Supposedly a feel-good movie, its one of those where you are made to feel bad so you can feel better after. It has you cringing and falling flat on your face before you get picked up. Though the ending may be touching, it does not do much in terms of solving the main character's personal issues and is unconvincing in a real-world setting. Perhaps in an ideal world, that is all it takes to be happy.A movie with a big case of 'you don't know what you have til its gone'. All it takes is an imaginary slap and you're back to accepting the life you have been dealt, only this time, you're happier about it.From an optimistic point of view, the movie is a good reminder to everyone that happiness isn't a checklist you have to accomplish, but a state of mind you attain when you feel content.7 out of 10 stars, because it's a classic and has a better storyline and script than most movies these days.",False
14,5,Self-Sacrificing Going Too Far?,bigverybadtom,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe premise of the story is, of course, how a man named George Bailey keeps sacrificing his money and his desires all his life to help others in various ways over the years, and when later in life he is finally overwhelmed by his latest problems which he cannot solve himself and is ready to commit suicide, an angel from Heaven whose eyes are upon promotion is sent down to tell George about how all his self-sacrificing had saved so many people from disaster.One can nitpick about various things in the movie: reading a Bible, there are references to cherubs and seraphs, angels whose status in Heaven is indicated by the number of wings they have; the fact that George, despite his frustrated ambitions, didn't do too badly-he has a nice wife and children and is not living in poverty, and not being eligible to serve in the military would not necessarily be considered by some people (including people who had) to be a bad thing.My problem, though, is this-it turns out that Bailey has lots of friends because of all the good he had done, and they're willing to pay him back to get him out of his financial hole and save him from jail. Unfortunately, in real life self-sacrifice, especially excessive self- sacrifice, does not necessarily result in gratitude from those one had sacrificed for. They might necessarily take your actions for granted and in fact might regard you as a slave, which all too often happens in real life. Once your purpose is served, the sacrificer is discarded and forgotten, or even despised. And that, alas, would have been the far more credible ending.",True
15,10,One of those quintessential Christmas movies....,TheLittleSongbird,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clichéd, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers?Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently.

16,n/a,Sheer brilliance!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"After strong performances in films such as ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"", James Stewart confirmed his status as one of the greats with his performance as George Bailey in ""It's a Wonderful Life"". This movie is, without a doubt, the best of all time.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a movie that you can watch over and over again. It's movie that makes you think, about life in general and how each person makes a difference, and about how great life can be (hence the title ""It's a Wonderful Life). Whilst making you think, it also entertains with many light hearted moments, particularly towards the end of the film.The direction, sound and casting in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" are second to none.  Yet it is the fact that almost any person can watch this movie and come away feeling inspired that makes it easily the best movie of all time!A 10/10 without a doubt!",False

It's a Wonderful Life is a truly great movie and I, like many others, have a habit of watching this movie very year on Christmas Eve, so I am this year. From where to start, this is from music, acting, screenplay, camera, directing, scenery, plot to adorable little details (squirrel on Uncle Billy's shoulder) the wonderful movie.

18,10,FRANK CAPRA'S OPUS,Sunsphxsuns,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you were to ask me what Holiday-themed film I enjoy the most and never get tired watching, my answer would invariably be, Frank Capra's ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946).Of course, there are many other great holiday movies that are also genuine cinematic treasures, even though they're not as well known as ""It's A Wonderful Life."" My ""must watch"" holiday list includes many of the black and white classics I have previously reviewed on IMDb such as, ""Holiday Inn (1942),""It Happened On 5th Avenue,"" (1947), A Christmas Carol (1951),"" ""Christmas In Connecticut,"" (1945) and although it's in color, ""White Christmas"" (1954). And for good measure I still immensely enjoy watching ""Home Alone 1 & 2"" (1990-1992) and the charming trilogy, ""The Santa Clause"" (1994-2004-2006).Nevertheless, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the singular holiday film that continues to resonate with me on multiple levels. It is a supremely powerful story of self-worth and destiny, bolstered by superb acting, laced with unforgettable characters like George Bailey, Clarence Oddbody, and Mr. Potter, thoughtful cinematography which perfectly captures the small town ambiance of Bedford Falls, sharp editing (no surprise since Capra began his film career as an editor), a beautiful score by Russian composer Dimitri Tiomkin, and more memorable quotes than could ever be listed here.Ironically, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" may never have popped up on anyone's cinematic radar screen had the proper copyright ownership documents been registered. How this error occurred is fascinating.The original 1945 ownership of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" belonged to Liberty Films, an independent motion picture production company created by the film's brilliant director, Frank Capra. The following year, Liberty was purchased by Paramount. Ten years later, in 1955, M. & A. Alexander subsequently purchased the rights to the short story, ""The Greatest Gift,"" on which the film was based. With the purchase also came the rights to the film itself, television syndication, and the music score. Shortly thereafter, National Telefilm Associates (NTA) became the new owner. Amazingly, a clerical error meant NTA had neglected to renew its copyright. By 1974, the movie fell into the ""public domain.""In essence, Capra's masterpiece no longer had copyright protection, and therefore, anyone could make copies of the film, package it anyway they chose, all without having to pay for it. Because of this, television studios began broadcasting ""It's A Wonderful Life"" during the Christmas holidays, while dozens of other companies packaged and sold the film in various media forms such as VHS, and later, Laser Disc and DVD. The good news- This nearly forgotten film was now being seen for the first time by millions of people. The bad news - Many of the reproductions were of poor quality, with some crudely edited down from the original 131 minute run time into a shorter length to accommodate TV scheduling. Nevertheless, these unusual series of events managed to breathe new life into Capra's stunning film for future generations.As often occurs with films destined for immortality, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was initially a financial box office failure, although it was nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and has been revered by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made.There's nothing more I can add to this review that hasn't been covered already by other astute IMDb reviewers, but I will say that if you have still not seen ""It's A Wonderful Life"" by now (2021) then stop whatever you're doing and buy the BR, DVD, or stream it. I'm confident even after your first viewing you are going to feel like you've just seen one of the greatest films ever made, and you would be absolutely right!No spoilers here as usual but I will reveal that while much of the film happens in the fictional town of Bedford Falls during a very cold, snowy, Wintery Christmas holiday, it was actually filmed in Southern California which was experiencing a sweltering record heat wave!",False

The characters, the situations, the message all come together in a way that intrinsically defines it as a Christmas movie, but when you get right down to it, the film transcends Christmas in a way that's truly heartwarming and magical. Jimmy Stewart had that unique ability to put the Everyman into his roles, and this picture certainly qualifies as one of his finest performances. Donna Reed could not have been a better choice to play Mary, displaying a wholesome sex appeal to go along with those traditional home town American values that pictures of the era were so skillful in portraying. Had Director Frank Capra made only this one picture, it would have earned him recognition as one of the true masters of cinema. I could go on and on, but there's really no point in trying to heap further accolades on a picture that has earned it's place in American film right at the top.

21,10,So is the movie...,MovieAddict2016,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerReview edited and therefore quite choppy due to maximum word limit.   Has there ever been a truer and more heartfelt character than George  Bailey? This is a man whose life is one of great significance, but he,  like all of us, does not always realize that this is so. He does not  recognize his impact on the world until an angel erases his existence  like chalk on a board. It is then that he is hit by the fact that one  man's failing life isn't always as inconsequential as it may seem.  We all remember when Clarence (Henry Travers) first appears on that  snowy bridge and saves George Bailey (James Stewart) from committing  suicide. He explains nonchalantly that he is an angel and George is  incredulous--until Clarence wipes away his entire past. His mother  doesn't recognize him. George tells her about his uncle as a source of  belief. She states that his uncle has been dead for some time, now.  The best scene in the entire film is that following when George is  thrown out by his mother. He runs towards the camera in an intense wide  shot, his face registering emotions of fear, horror, and ultimately the  horrid understanding of what has happened. This role is the highlight  of James Stewart's career--he never came anywhere close to the superb  performance he gives in this movie. There is a reason it was his  favorite film he ever starred in.  Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is the grown image of all of us:  As a child he dreamed of nothing but exotic locations and adventurous  travels to foreign lands. But now he is a family man, a father and a  husband. He has left behind his silly bachelor notions, but they still  come back to haunt him. Bailey owns the town savings and loan, left to  him by his father. The cranky Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) wants  complete monopoly over the town, and all that stands in his way is  Bailey and his little bank. But Bailey, an inner disgust and hatred  towards Potter brewing since his childhood days, refuses to cave in and  give it all away.  Then one day, George's absentminded and quite eccentric uncle (Thomas  Mitchell), misplaces a large sum of money, leaving George hopeless and  Potter with a serious advantage. After blowing up at his wife (Donna  Reed) and kids at home, George gets drunk at a local bar, is scorned at  by a schoolteacher's wife, and left dazed and confused, walking through  the snowy town at night during the happy Christmas season without a  hope in the world. Battered and delirious, thinking back over his  apparently pointless and wasted life, he contemplates suicide. He prays  to God and wishes that he had never existed. Which is why Clarence  comes down from heaven to sort things out and answer his prayer.  Essentially bombing at the box office when it was first released, and  then proceeding to fall into copyright problems for years, ""It's a  Wonderful Life"" resurfaced only years later when it was brought back  into the public domain circa 1970. When other channels were airing  expensive Hollywood movies during the Christmas season, PBS picked up  the film and played it as a counter attack, a weak hope prevailing in  them that the classic film buffs out there would tune in. They did. And  so did families across the nation. Every year the ratings got stronger  and stronger and now, almost sixty years following the movie's initial  release, it is considered a holiday tradition.  George considers suicide as a way of escaping his problems without  really thinking over the possible outcomes given his final choice. He  looks back upon his life as wasted potential; he wanted to become an  adventurer, break his family's small-town tradition and become  something huge. Mentally scanning his life to the point in time when he  stands on that bridge, George Bailey believes that he has simply and  truly created a waste of space. He's ready to end his (assumed)  pointless life when his entire point of view is wholly altered by the  power of God. George suddenly realizes that though he never lived out  his boyhood fantasies, he did so much more than he ever dreamed of. He  saved his brother's life, which resulted in a huge impact in later  years; he made an influence in the lives of others and brought peace  and harmony to an otherwise small town by prevailing at the requests of  Mr. Potter; he married a beautiful wife and had children, all of whom  will no doubt have some measure of significance later in the world. And  his wish on that bridge was that he had never been born.  Often I am asked to name my favorite movie, and though I ignore  requests and state that I have not seen every existing movie and  therefore my judgment carries no significance, I have the lightest  whimsy that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" may be my favorite motion picture  to date. I cherish few other films just as close, but to me, ""It's a  Wonderful Life"" is more moving than ""Casablanca,"" a better study of one  man's life than ""Citizen Kane,"" and a movie that will live on in the  hearts and memory of viewers long after we are gone. I believe that  this is the definitive Americana motion picture, regardless of how I  compare it to my other favorites, which may carry the same weight but  not the same true significance. Few films come as close to the heart as  ""It's a Wonderful Life."" And few films come as close to ""It's a  Wonderful Life"" at all, for that matter.  5/5.",True
22,6,Life's Not Always So Wonderful,evanston_dad,n/a,15/08/2025,"My apologies to all of you ""It's a Wonderful Life""-ers out there. Please believe me when I say that I've tried multiple times to develop warm feelings for this movie. But it's just not meant to be. I've seen this film a couple of times, and I never want to see it again.I want to beat James Stewart's George Bailey about the head and shoulders every time I watch the movie. Perhaps the most passive-aggressive hero in motion picture history, George Bailey spends half of his time sacrificing his own happiness for the sake of others, and the other half whining about his hard luck. No, George, it's not hard luck...it's the result of your own decision making skills. Either be selfless and stop complaining, or be a bastard and screw everyone else. But make up your mind, and don't take two hours to do it.Ahhh, perhaps I now live in too cynical and jaded a world to tolerate George's namby-pamby indecision. But maybe that's a reason better than any other to keep this film around. Character aside, however, the one thing I can unequivocally praise about this film is the performance of Stewart. He provides a welcome bitter edge to combat Capra's sugary-sweet corn. His breakdown scene in a bar, where he desperately prays to God to help him keep himself together, is a tour-de-force.Drag it out every Christmas and enjoy...I won't begrudge you that small pleasure. Just don't expect me to join along.Grade: B-",False
23,10,My favourite film,geoff-mendoza,n/a,15/08/2025,"No other film comes anywhere near to getting people to find out what things would have been like if an event had or had not taken place - Groundhog Day comes close (my second favourite) and Sliding Doors tries.For sheer emotion this film has the lot. I have watched it over 40 times now and I still get tearful towards the end of the film. If anyone wants to find out why life is worth living, this is the one to watch.",False
24,7,Rich Twin Poor Twin's View of the Movie,henry-225,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is an article from www.richtwinpoortwin (dot) com I hope all of you had a Merry Christmas. It's A Wonderful Life is a good classic movie. It will always bring back fond memories. For many years since we can remember, my twin and I saw the classic movie: It's A Wonderful Life air at our old home. We switched the channel every year when the movie just started because the movie is in black and white. We just dismissed the movie and thought it would be a bore. A few years later when we were in college, freshman year. one of our best professors we had in our academic years had this movie as part of the curriculum - where we watched the movie and did the usual analysis on the movie. I didn't know it at the time, but he was a very good professor and person. He actually was searching for a purpose, more in life, the meaning of life, happiness in life, the reason for living, etc. He was actually trying to wake us up. But I digress; we will talk about this professor in upcoming entries. Now back to It's a wonderful life. The movie is quite enjoyable.We recently went back to NYC this Christmas and watched It's a Wonderful life for the first time in our old home. I recall the analysis we did after watching the show in college. We all came up with the all too familiar analysis of how Potter was rich, greedy, and evil. And how George Bailey was the good person, the hero who was doing what was right - he was fighting the good fight so that everyone else can have a wonderful life in Bedford Falls.There was a common theme painted throughout the movie: being good/doing good meant sacrificing yourself - physically, mentally, and financially- George risked his life to save his brother Harry (lost his hearing in his left ear), getting beaten up by his childhood boss after saving a client from being poisoned, taking a job that was below him in order to save the Bank and the community from Potter, getting married to Mary because just to make his mother happy, turning down Sam Wayne Wright's offer, giving away 2 thousand dollars of his own hard earned money he saved for his honeymoon to others during the bank run on black Friday, and turning down Potter's offer that would have freed him.It's A Wonderful Life enforces the idea that having money meant you are greedy, evil, selfish, lazy, cruel, racist, lonely, bitter, uncaring, and that you will lose your money as fast as you made it throughout the movie. Potter was the living symbol of this commonly accepted false idea. Potter is a ""warped, frustrated, old man."" He was crippled and pushed around in a wheelchair. He has no family, was uncaring - he called for a board meeting to resolve the bank after Bailey Senior's death, was a racist - he refers to his tenants as ""garlic eaters"", has a skull on his desk, cruel - he withholds foolish Uncle Ben's $8000 cash deposit just to get back at the Baileys, and he levied harsh rent from his poor tenants, and on the last scene where we see what would happen if he controlled Bedford falls - it would be called Potter's field where Bedford falls is just a grave yard, there would be less of the ""neighborly"", lots of bars, clubs, and gambling.But when we watched the movie at home, we see that the movie: It's a Wonderful Life is nothing more than propaganda. Its message is worse than its character Potter, himself. The movie tells its audience to just Settle. That is perhaps the worst and most dangerous message of all - be a noob, don't even try to become a pwner. The movie's message tells you to just try to find the good things that you have and not to try harder, not to help yourself, not to pursue your dreams, and just help others because you are seen as greedy if you try to pursue your dreams before helping others. In short - mind others businesses, help as many as you can with what little you have and look for ""the good things"" that you have and you shall be happy and you will have a wonderful life. The last message of the movie was "" A man is never poor as long as he has friends,"" which is true to some degree but the movie's bigger message and idea is troubling.What if Clarence showed George Bailey actually achieving what he wanted?? As in showing George what he, his wife, and the rest of Bedford Falls would be if George would have achieved what he wanted to do - go to college, travel the world, build bridges, build skyscrapers, and become what he wanted to BE since he was a small boy - in short living his childhood dream. But instead Clarence CHEATED him and US by just showing how unhappy the community would be if he was not born. And it is very fascinating how Sam Wayne Wright becomes what George Bailey always wanted to be - rich, traveling the world, having a company, wives, power, fame, fancy cars and FREE from having to put his nose to the grind stone.And that is all I have to say about that. Or what Sam would say, ""Hee-Haw!""",True
25,5,It WAS a wonderful life,namor2000,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are movies that we like so much we will watch them to the point of redundancy and never get tired of them. It's A Wonderful Life used to be one of mine, but not anymore. In fact, I can't remember the last time I actually watched it in its entirety. I realize the reason why now...it's Frank Capra's populist message. It had finally gotten under my craw.The message, that having money is EVIL but being altruistic and broke is GOOD, served Capra well during the depression when everyone was broke (ironically, Capra got rich off this message). By 1946, Americans had money again and populism had worn out its welcome, which might explain the movie's dismal box office take.George Bailey is altruism squared. He willingly becomes a doormat to townfolks who can't spoonfeed themselves, forgoing his goals and dreams of making his own life better. Sorry George, but I eventually lost sympathy for you. Your desires are equally important.Other characters I got even more fed up with: Uncle Billy...what a drunken bonehead! Cmon, George, I don't care if he is family. Either fire this rumdum or make him into a harmless janitor or something so he won't go losing $8000 at a clip. Harry Bailey, you're next! You have no intention of ever paying back George for your college education, am I right? And finally, Clarence Oddbody,AS2. No wonder you haven't gotten your wings, you doofus. You knew about the $8000, so tell George that Potter stole the money so he, Mary, and the rest of the family could storm the bank and clean his clock like in the Saturday Night Live skit from 1986. Yes, I know that last part was played for laughs, but wouldn't that be your gut response, though?Maybe my criticism is a bit harsh, but it's towards the populist message and story line. I still like the acting in it, and the special effects were very good for the time...Capra's fake snow all over Bedford Falls still looks realistic to this day. And as goofy and manipulative as it seems, I'm glad George's deadbeat customers finally paid him back in the end.(P.S.: George, this would be a good time to remind your brother, Harry The War Hero, that he owes you four years of college tuition and the cost of a long distance phone call!)",True

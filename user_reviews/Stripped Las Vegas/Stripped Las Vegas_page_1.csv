1,5,A View Into The Vertical Business In Las Vegas,flashlightreview,n/a,17/08/2025,"This was another documentary of the dancing/entertainment world of Las Vegas. The dancers presented explain how they found their way into the business and how their lives developed.There is also insight into their personal lives and the timelines how their careers developed.Overall, the production quality could have been better. It is more of a interview style documentary with video clips taken from mobile phones and a few improvised scenes.Income potential: the girls openly discuss their salaries and income potential, as well as the financial reasoning why they entered the industry.I would gives this an average rating of five.",False
2,2,complete nonsense,howboutthisone_huh,n/a,17/08/2025,"If you're a guy, the last thing you want to do is go to a strip club, especially the ones in vegas, by yourself unless you're really good looking, otherwise it's about as much fun as clubbing with your mom. If you go, you want to be in a group of 4 or 5 and among friends who aren't competitive. You want backup when you say 'no'. As soon as you hit the door, the women are competing to see how much money they can get from you. They'll come over, chat it up, ask you if you want to go back to a room. Even if you say no, the meter is running just talking to you. They expect you to pay for their time. Oh, just came in to watch the pole dancing, or maybe the drinks, or gfb the food, doesn't matter. You're not there for free. Used to know this one high end stripper, turned bartender, turned wider load, and she wouldn't shut up about how she and another stripper would tag team to rip guys off. So typically these women lose their sex appeal over time and it's pretty common that they end up with younger guys who treat them badly, or much older sugar daddys. So didn't feel sorry for her at all when she got dumped; on a cruise. This isn't unique to vegas or even the US. You'll find the same among sex workers in japan only it's so it's so extreme and disturbing. Anyway, if you're trey parker, you can make a big splash and the girls will remember you but otherwise you're just a mark, a sucker, an easy grift. It wasn't always like that. There used to be some great strip places in vegas where pole dancing was an art and you could have a good time without feeling like you'd been molested but those days are gone. You can find much prettier women at the clubs, without all the baggage.Here's a true story. There once was a club in vegas that had several pool tables and a bar away from the main floor and they advertised things like poor tournaments and such. Turns out, these events were all staged to draw in locals but they weren't for the locals but mainly people in the industry that worked at other clubs. You thought maybe you were going there to play pool and the women would be all over you asking for tips and ignored the russian mob looking guys at the other tables. Didn't last long before the word got around and they closed. How do you not make money with a strip club in vegas? The women don't work for the clubs but rather pay the club to be there.And I don't know where they got these women but their not top shelf. My guess, some of the sleazier clubs around town way off the strip.",False
3,10,Stripped Las Vegas,quisha-01195,n/a,17/08/2025,"I enjoyed the documentary it gave a behind the scenes of what the women do and how they hustle to survive. It's not all glitz and glamour, it shows the issues they face within themselves, they talk about their upbringing how it made them who they are as adults. The women have great talent and strength to know how to pole dance like that. 10/10.",False
4,8,An Inside Look,ajam_fam,n/a,17/08/2025,The doc was very good. Covered what's it like to be stripper and gave insight. To them it's their job. At work they're strippers but at the end of the day they're people like you and me. Not all strippers are bad. It's worth a watch.,False

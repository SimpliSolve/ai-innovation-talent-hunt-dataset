1,8,"A Powerful Call to Action, a Must-watch for All..",samabc-31952,n/a,15/08/2025,"According to the National Crime Records Bureau, reported incidents of crime against women in India skyrocketed by 87% between 2011 and 2021, from 228,650 to 428,278 cases. The National Family Health Survey reveals that nearly one in three women (31%) in India has experienced physical or sexual violence. Shockingly, gender-based violence is a leading cause of ill health among women, surpassing the combined impact of traffic accidents and malaria. Yet, this epidemic of violence remains largely unaddressed, with a staggering 86% of survivors failing to seek help and 77% never speaking about their ordeal.Often mental abuse is overlooked which is a significant aspect of gender-based violence. 1 in 4 women experience emotional abuse by their partners (National Coalition Against Domestic Violence) and 30% of these women experience anxiety and depression due to emotional abuse (National Institute of Mental Health).Moved by the horrific incidents of the brutal assault on a mother and daughter on a national highway and the rape and burning of a 14-year-old girl, Srishti Bakshi, a multinational marketing professional, founded ""Project CrossBow"" to empower women across India to challenge gender bias. She embarked on a remarkable 2400-mile journey on foot from Kanyakumari to Srinagar to raise awareness about the alarming rate of violence against women.The documentary presents heart-wrenching stories of three women from diverse backgrounds who have faced violence, abuse, and torture. Their stories will break your heart and raise essential questions about the persistent gender bias in our digital era. Impactful and poignant storytelling makes this documentary a must-watch! Thought-provoking and inspiring, a powerful reminder of women's strength and resilience and a call to action for a more just and equitable society. Impressive cinematograohy. Hats-off to Srishti Bakshi whose courage and.determination set an inspiring example, showing how one can spark change and make a difference.",False

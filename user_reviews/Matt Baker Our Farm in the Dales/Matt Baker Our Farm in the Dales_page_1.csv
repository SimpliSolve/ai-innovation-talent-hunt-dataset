1,10,In awe....,timothy-price-794-581328,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolute delight. Such a pleasure to watch the family address a difficult situation with such endeavour and enthusiasm. The whole family has such energy, and skill, it's humbling to see. And a pleasure to see their gorgeous organic farm, improved while carefully maintaining the area, all against the backdrop of the beautiful location. And a shout-out to the many friends/locals and people in the near and further community all contributing. Thoroughly enjoyed.Now on series 3, and it just gets better. They deal with everything thrown at them (and farming is hard) with enthusiasm, skill, I am just in awe of them. Ingenuity, hard work, nothing fazes them. The parents built this, Matt is developing and improving it with the incredible support of his wife who matches him in ability, and the kids get involved big time too, as enthusiastic as the others. God, I wish I had their energy, not to mention ability. Very, very special.Now SEEN Series 3 and my respect and admiration for them just grows. The ingenuity, effort, is just astounding. A delight to spend time with them. And such a beautiful place. A little bit of Magic.",False
2,10,Cross generational and disability inclusive,SunnyDaise,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally - a show that my family can relate too! Having lived in cross generational and disability households with on site businesses for most of my life, I was so happy to have a TV production that I could really click with. I was slightly irked by gender stereotypes in Season 1, so wrote to C4 and this issue was dealt with in Season 2 ie both kids learning to cook etc. We're very much looking forward to Season 3 and the spin-off series where Matt and his parents go out for day trips.",False
3,2,Matt Baker: Our Farm in the Dales,studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm sure this was well-intentioned, but all this programme ends up looking like is Matt Baker broadcasting his family home movie footage on telly.Sorry Matt.",False
4,4,"Sadly Spoiled by Obnoxious ,Pushy , Knowit All Mother",kevingoodwin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCould have been an interesting, this is the current mould of a UK feel good country based series.However the ever interrupting, trappy mother takes the shine off the program.You just want to tell her to "" Just Shut Up ! "" and is a constant thought through the whole program.If only the rest of the cast knew half as much as she constantly interrupts to point out to everyone else.Shame one unpleasant personality can ruin what might have been mildly entertaining. Not anywhere as interesting as Our Yorkshire Farm , well to be honest probably the weakest of the current television documentary trend, with much less pleasant cast.",True

1,6,Interesting Character study lacking responsibility,PaxtonMalloy,n/a,16/08/2025,It is a interesting character study about two highly disfunctional people that have not the slightest idea of the problems they have with themself. And I have seem similar documentaries where basically every time you see people working in that industry have difficult and problematic back stories which makes sense of course.What I find problematic is how that this movie deals with the abuse. There is never really a comment on how unacceptable this is and the minute the guy admits on camera that he abuses her the obligation of the filmmaker is to contact the authorities and stop filmimg which he didnt to and even get more air time out of them.,False
2,1,Useless movie.,noscamers,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have watched all the film :( (can someone give me back the time wasted, please). In the start, the couple was started interested, but by the time I was watched, Eddie started to don't have respect with Emma. I was so sad for Emma to go through with him like this. No one have to do like you, Eddie. Eddie, you should not go so far with Emma. Emma needed respect from you a lot, and kindness, and many more. But, you Eddie, so bad boy. Anyway, people do not waste your time to watch the film. All respect to everyone, you choose what to do. My suggestion is only. Emma and Eddie, all the best from me. With big admiration from the UK R. F.",True
3,1,"One of Those Rambling, Boring (And Baseless) Documentaries",mmabis,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is just another one of those boring documentaries that's more akin to that situation where someone is in need of some cash, and is ALSO DESPERATE for fame and attention, but yet cannot seem to really get traction and a foothold in today's plethora of Social Media Influencers (and even not amongst just ""general, everyday Social Media Users""), so they decide to try their hand at making a documentary about something they, from their own, first person, subjective opinion and/or point of view and/or standpoint, deem and view as ""significant"" or ""interesting,"" in their lives in an attempt to gain that fame, fortune, attention, traction, and foothold that they are so desperately seeking, and what they end up producing is basically akin to an overly produced home movie. After listening to the lead ""stars""/couple, Eddie & Emma, ramble on and on, about nothing really, the documentary completely lost my interest only 8 minutes in. Begrudgingly forcing myself to try to finish watching it and forcing myself to somewhat pay attention to it, the end of the documentary was finally upon me, and I was able to officially, formally validate that in addition to this documentary being amateurish, rambling, boring, and an extremely desperate & very thirsty attempt at grabbing fame and fortune for Eddie & Emma, it was completely pointless and baseless...nothing more than incessant rambling on and on.",False
4,7,"Good movie, don't trust rating",nt-nk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before looking at the rating I was already sure that this movie might have gotten review-bombed. It is an honest but still delicate portrayal of someone whose life depends on people not seeing her for what she really is. And her just as difficult partner as well. So wouldn't be all too surprising if 100-bucks-for-a-used-panty fans would go and ""rectify"" the movie's message.The movie portrays Emma and Eddie, two porn creators with care, an outside-in perspective, and without an in-your-face judgement, not unlike Scorsese's approach in the Wolf of Wall Street. And just like there, one can formulate their own opinion about the protagonists' actions. While in the middle a bit slower, generally a nice watch with great shots and solid directing. If something is 4.6 here, it is the reality it portrays.",False
5,7,Every young person should see this,norajelinek,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows us perfectly how fake social media personalities can be. It also shows how a disfunctional relationship 'works'. I can only feel sorry for these 2 human beings, and I truly hope that one day they will be able to do real, useful therapy and gain sufficient self-knowledge to be able to feel real happiness and peace. They seem truly lost, chasing a dream that can destroy almost everything they once were. As a Budapest resident, I truly felt horrified when I saw the scene where Emma walks around the streets barefoot. Our streets are never clean... But of course dirty feet was the least of her issues I suppose. Regarding the abuse I felt like they are both in denial about a lot of things. The relationship turns toxic pretty fast... I think the movie should be shown in highschools to have discussions about, it could really make some youngsters think about their lifechoices.",False
6,10,Authentic documentary,captaindonut-90622,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is absolutely amazing and I do not understand the negative reviews. In my opinion, this documentary stands out for its authenticity and excellent humor. The story of Emma and Eddie illustrates both the rewards and the challenges associated with the cam industry. While the flow of the movie might not be flawless, this imperfection adds to its genuine feel. Many movies boast perfect production values but lack authenticity. This documentary, however, embraces its rawness, making it more relatable and real. I highly recommend watching it to experience its unique charm and insightful narrative for yourself.",False
7,7,Read my bullet points review..,Srijan-Mishra,n/a,16/08/2025,Great one time watch..Decent documentary..Great direction..Great editing..Great work by DOP..Nice chemistry between duo..Shows both highs & lows of a relationship..Shows both highs & lows of cam industry.. ie dealing with all flirting & polygamy..Missing the downfall & pregnancy arc..(obviously because of covid)Agreed that both are scarred in their own ways..Watching such documentaries gives me second thought on marriage that it is so easily breakable these days.But please someone tell her that people are beautiful naturally. No fillers need to make you more beautiful. She started to look hideous after the surgery.,False
8,10,Very interesting watch!,qdncmcnx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very interesting documentary! I like how they portait the downfall of a toxic relationship, and show the true selves of the couple. Interesting to see how their characters developed through the years and they became more aware of their feelings. This documentary is quite emotial, if you have ever found yourself in a mutualy abusive relationship you are going to relate a lot. It is the type of movie that leaves you wondering, the type of movie where you are in a situation and a scene pops up in your head. Besides the emotional roller coaster it also makes you laugh a lot! I definitely recommend!",False

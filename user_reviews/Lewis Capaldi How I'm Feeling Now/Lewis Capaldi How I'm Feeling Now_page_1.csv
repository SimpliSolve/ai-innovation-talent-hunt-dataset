1,7,A national treasure,CooperWatches,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn insight into the life of Lewis Capaldi, the start of his career, the anticipated launch of his second album. Although the documentary takes a turn upon the discovery of a Lewis's Tourette's which Lewis is completely open about, which is brave and will bring awareness.It is clearly the usual checkbox documentary that celebrities sign up for in order to market albums, but this is Lewis Capaldi. No facade. As his Dad says 'no heirs and graces'.I laughed, I cried and I want to love and protect this man at all costs. He is a national treasure and I wish him a long and successful career. The music industry can be toxic, may he have a character strong enough to never change and the support system to know if it's ever time to quit.",True
2,8,Really good,DVK1234,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know his music but I don't really follow Lewis Capaldi. Great documentary regarding his life, how he skyrocketed into the industry after pretty humble beginnings. Who he is as a person does not seem to have changed in spite of his massive success, although he clearly has struggled more with anxiety and nervous tics because of it.I'm quite surprised that it took so long for him to get a formal diagnosis of Tourette's. Did the family really not know? The dad suggested he go for chiropractic treatment; Lewis said that will not help. It's heartbreaking that what he loves to do most is affecting his mental and physical health, because he puts so much pressure on himself to do well. He also feels obligated to be successful because now he is responsible for so many others; he now carries them too. Kind of unrealistic to think the success can be repeated as his first album was the culmination of a lifetime of creating. No doubt he will do great though.He is an amazing talent and he has an amazing voice.I wish him every success and I highly recommend this documentary.",False
3,8,Great view inside his life,acleach1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was not really expecting anything going into this film. I am not really a fan of Lewis capaldi, but know his music and knew very little about himself. I really enjoyed this film! It did not keep my attention the whole time but it was really cool to see the ins and outs of his life. He is such a unique celebrity, in the fact that he does not really give in to the glitz and glam of the Hollywood lifestyle. He is goofy and down to each, and really honest. The film starts off with his current life, and talk about his life and career during the pandemic and also struggles he faced. I was unaware of the hardships in his life, so it brought a whole new layer to him after watching the documentary. I liked the production a lot as well. It was a good mix of interview clips, concert clips, and different shot types as well. I liked being able to hear him sing his music acoustic during some scenes too. I loved when they put in clips that he took himself as well. There were some video clips that were taken off of his iPhone in a selfie mode which was fun because it made it feel personal. He was really open with the camera crew and let the viewers take and honest look into his life. I would definitely recommend for a weekend watch if you are at all interested in Less Capaldi.",False
4,10,"Laugh, cry & feel",lolita-rose22,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA documentary that will make you laugh, cry and feel everything. It's been an adventure learning about Lewis' story, where the music has come from, his medical history and his family history. Opening line of being in a small town with mostly pubs , everytime I go back to Ireland , I visit family in a similar town and it does simply ground you. Lewis has true talent and charisma, and a group of family, friends and colleagues who support and love him. Telling his story about his struggles with anxiety and trauma will hopefully help others with opening up about their own. Great doco & 100% recommend.",True
5,10,This hit me in the feels.,lauriewfagan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI mean what a class documentary! Although it was serious and sad, it makes you love him even more.My parents watched it and had the same reaction as his mum n dad to his new songs, 'not his best work'
Must be a Scottish parent thing, I told them to GTF! I've preordered the new album in vinyl and CD cause I know it'll be THAT good!The journey that wee lewis goes on with regards to his mental health will really resonate with people of his age and younger, he's using his voice to talk abit things that aren't all glamorous but that are real and I take my hat off to him for it!Class act all round!Moan the Lewis!!",True
6,9,"Good dude, great family",ianfitzpatrik,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lewis is a nice guy who became famous and is struggling with the adulation that his talent has thrust upon him, he feels responsible for the fortunes of those around him who are dependent on his successes. What a refreshing break from the many narcissists who feel they deserve to be famous with zero talent to begin fret the world.Lewis' music is not my typical genre but I've found myself listening because he is such and appealing and genuine character. He has his struggles but is very aware of them and their effect on him and hopefully that rational thinking will serve him well in his mental health journey.He has amazing parents, their support and leadership be for their son is inspiring and it shows that coming from a loving my family can get you through tough times.Great doco and the protagonist is open, honest and engaging, well worth a watch.",False
7,9,"Keep it up Lewis, you are so NOT an imposter!",VeggieVader,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a very interesting documentary. I had no idea that he suffered from so much anxiety and nervous tics. He also suffered from Imposter syndrome, which I knew nothing about either. I learned a lot about Lewis and how he is as a person. A warm and kind person who cares about the people around him, and they care about him as well. This was very heartwarming to see. His family and his team/manager paused his career for three years so they could focus on getting Lewis the help he needed, and this made me so glad. This was a big difference from how it can be. It was not the same with Avicii, who had a manager who only cared about money... Avicii would probably be alive today if only he had received the same support that Lewis received.Lewis Capaldi has an amazing and unique voice, and I'm happy that he is feeling better and is back with new music! Keep it up Lewis, you are so NOT an imposter! I strongly recommend this documentary.",False
8,10,Beautiful and inspired me to keep going. A must watch!,swoo-90553,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautiful, touching, emotional film about Lewis who made me feel like I'm not alone. I have anxiety (particularly health anxiety)and hypochondria too which can cripple me some days. Watching him try to work through it while keeping such a positive attitude inspired me. I'm going to get much needed assistance and keep watching and listening to Lewis to keep me going. He's so real and manages to make me laugh in-between the tears. His videos and music are amazing, this film shows how important mental health is and how strong Lewis is. A must watch!! Love you Lewis, see you in Adelaide in July!",False
9,10,LOVE IT!,meganleach-05382,n/a,16/08/2025,Loved every minute of this mixed emotions while watching. He should be very proud of himself because I know I am. He deserves everything can't wait for the album to come out. Massive fan of his and his music. Love him! 4 songs released in his new album and I can't pick one that's my favourite. This has got to be his year he's done so well can't be more happier and pleased for him! I've been a fan of his for so long always got his music on repeat. Great documentary couldn't of asked for anything better. He has an amazing voice and my best singer by a mile love him can't stop listening to his songs not a day goes by where i don't listen to one. HE DESERVES EVERYTHING!!!,False
10,10,Please watch! It doesn't disappoint.,bzqqzxs,n/a,16/08/2025,I loved every minute. We forget that artists are not super human. This a very personal glimpse of the pressures and anxieties surrounding a very talented artist creating a piece of art for the world and nearly consuming the him in the process. I commend Lewis Capaldi for allowing us to be a part of his life even when the pressures are too much to bear. We imagine all of the high points that a celebrity might have and this documentary reminds us there are low points that we are rarely exposed to. I am a big fan of his and I hope he knows there are people rooting so hard for him to be healthy and happy. I shed some tears and left a piece of my soul with Lewis.,False
11,10,Didn't think I could love this guy anymore!,nwws-40578,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film was just everything and more! It showed a really great insight into Lewis' life, he's just fantastic. I loved how he spoke about his mental health and showed how it's nothing to be ashamed of and there is help available for everyone who may be suffering. The film shows parts of his tours/concerts, his family, interview clips and more which really grabbed my attention. I don't think there was ever a scene where I felt bored and as if I couldn't carry on watching, I was glued to the screen the whole time!His music is phenomenal and brings all kinds of emotions, just like this film.Forever proud of you Lewis!",True
12,10,Keep your head up!!,sarah_sle,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a mom who has a son your age with Tourette's, I find you extremely courageous! I am thankful he doesn't have the stress level you have! Stress definitely makes his worse. He doesn't take any meds for it. He just seems to manage his lifestyle and work around it. I am so glad you decided to make a documentary about it though! I think it really helps to educate people and make them more aware of it. I think the more people know the less reaction they will have when presented. Funny, I don't even really notice his tics u til they get more pronounced. Then I know he's dealing with something. When I watched your documentary I felt the same emotional pull towards you too. Sometimes you just need a hug and a break. A break from the stress. I hope you find your happy medium! You're a very talented individual and I wish you all life has to offer! Just remember to give yourself a break when you need it and don't feel guilty!",False
13,10,Outstanding film depiction of crippling anxiety,rytftsztx,n/a,16/08/2025,"This thoughtfully created and so generously shared life story depicts a very real struggle with with crippling anxiety. The documentary, while shared by a famous person, clearly depicts the anxiety and resultant life changes that are prévenant within the general population as well. The generosity and thoughtfulness behind sharing such a very real struggle should not go unnoticed. Please support this man in all of his life endeavors. Take heart from his eloquently shared life experience. If you too suffer with anxiety, know there is no shame in obtaining help. Thank you Lewis. Glorious film. Watch it now.",False
14,10,Inspiring & Beautiful,jlewis-89461,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this film before really knowing much about Lewis Capaldi. I knew all of his music, but not too much about his personal life. Honestly, I was blown away to see the raw talent that comes from Lewis. I absolutely adored seeing how supportive his family is to him, and how despite all the pressures of the music industry and the shows, Lewis is so passionate about getting back up on that stage and entertaining his fans with beautiful music. It's no doubt that Lewis is talented, but my gosh I am even more excited to hear the rest of his album now. This documentary is the reason I ended up buying tickets to one of his shows recently. Lewis, you are a true gem and I am so grateful to have found your music.",False
15,10,NO words,tnvqcqh,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThere literally no words to describe how amazing that documentary was! It was truly amazing! It truly showed just because you suffering with mental health and with other problems! That you still can't shine! Even starts sometimes have to dim down before they can shine bright again!The love and support for his family and team are amazing! And he truly a funny and wee down to earth guy! And it shows that! He's hasn't let fame changed him! And the people around him has made him grounded to his Scottish roots! And I like that!Keep being Lewis! And keep being the wee funny guy that you are <3..,True
16,10,A look into the most authentic artist of our time,hollyariley,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is absolutely phenomenal. Showing so many real and raw sides to his life . Lewis has a way of connecting with people he shares his gifts with . Not only through the music but he is one if not the most open and honest artist. He always makes sure to take time to talk and connect with his fans, from his music , this documentary and Even on stage to a crowd . He has mastered the art of writing perfect pieces of work that you can relate to and feel his emotions💙. This documentary will make you sad in parts but it will also let you see Lewis for who he is behind the fame . The song how I'm feeling now is also such a great song to do with mental health . We love you Lewis.",False
17,10,Emotional documentary- might be biased,simpsonchloe-51015,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerReally interesting to see the inside perspective of fame on a famous person. Lewis' personality and comedic aspects make it amazing and heartfelt to watch. Very inspirational and very hard to watch without getting emotional. ( I might be biased as I love the man and his music.) It shows the reality of being such a popular celebrity and the pressures of the music industry and opens the conversation to the mental health of musicians. It's a really, really good watch, so well worth spending an evening time. You see all of the things behind the scenes of his gigs and how his tourettes affects him. I really loved watching it, and I'm sure it'll have the same effect in you too.",True
18,10,Amazing singer and soul,AlessiaBoasso,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've absolutely loved this documentary! If you want to cry and laugh at the same time you've to watch it!Lewis Capaldi is such a beautiful soul... I've appreciated how funny and real he is and that he has embraced and showed to the world his vulnerabilities.Without talking about his enormous talent in singing and writing songs!It's a real backstage of his professional and private life.I also wanna thank him to give me and my boyfriend a little bit of courage to be more confident (our dream is to become singers too).I've just bought your tickets to see you on tour.Can't wait to see you in Milan

19,10,Heartbreakingly real and relatable,sixc-62416,n/a,16/08/2025,Lewis is very honest and open about his struggles with his growing global fame. It takes you behind scenes of the music writing process and you get a glimpse of his family life. I enjoyed getting to know him a bit better. And seeing him be his authentic self vs what we see on stage or on social media is refreshing and makes him that much more likable and relatable. We all come from somewhere and are shaped by our life experiences and it seems he found a good outlet to express the challenges he has faced. The cinematography and editing is also fantastic. The whole crew did an excellent job pulling this together. Will watch again.,False
20,10,Glasgow's gift,noela-71787,n/a,16/08/2025,"Been a massive fan since 2018. Covid robbed us of him for a while. I've seen him live three times and will be seeing him again in August absolutely adore him. The vulnerability of this film is heart wrenching. People think fame and fortune is a sure way to happiness. It hurt my heart to watch the internal battles Lewis faces as his biggest critic is himself. He has a beautiful family and friend network I hope his tourettes doesn't stand in the way of his dreams as his ticks looks painful and draining. He is the epitome of staying true to himself, he seems really genuine. He is hilarious and insanely talented. He needs to believe more in himself because he deserves everything he achieves. I hope another documentary will follow in time. I also hope I get my selfie with this guy one day.",False
21,10,A GIFT FROM THE UNIVERSE,amyymillermm,n/a,16/08/2025,"THIS. FILM. I've only gone & watched it five times. The bravery and humility it takes to not only film something of this nature but to then share it with the world is just immense. This film is such a unique look into the pressures of ""stardom"" and how those pressures can manifest in the ""star"". It was heartbreaking, heartwarming, and heart filled. This film brings so much awareness to the mental health conversation that needs to keep happening. Lewis is so incredibly needed in the world, I feel almost lucky to have been around all these years watching his career unfold. Also, why is his dad kinda hot 👀",False
22,10,Such an inspirational film!,kristinapoplin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLewis is truly an inspiration to anyone who watches this film. His grit and determination to keep doing what he loves while working through his personal challenges is incredible. I loved the end when you could see a difference in him and his happiness after he set boundaries with work and found out what worked for him. I pray he continues to find ways to cope with his struggles without them limiting the dreams he has for himself. It was also really nice to hear the back story behind ""Before you go"". I found this song when one of my family members died by suicide and it got me through a lot of grief and put words to the emotions I was feeling. Thanks, Lewis!Absolutely a Lewis super fan before this and even more so after!",True
23,10,Unbelievable Movie,ellenmoc,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have been a huge fan of Lewis Capaldi ever since he released his debut single bruises. I'm a massive fan of his personality, his humour and of course his music. This movie gives a great insight into the life of Lewis Capaldi and the struggles he has faced along the way. This movie had me laughing, crying and everything in between. It is an exceptional movie and I would highly recommend a watch. I also think this movie is so real. Lewis doesnt hide anything and expresses his personality in full. When he played the song 'pretender' I almost broke down into tears, it is such a beautiful and real song. Also I urge you to listen to his brand new single ""wish you the best"". I have it on repeat constantly since it was released. It is truly a masterpiece!",True
24,10,So much love and respect,kayleighfreeman-93307,n/a,16/08/2025,"Always loved his music but I feel since watching the Netflix documentary I can connect deeper with his songs. I understand them better and appreciate the words. It was amazing to watch, even through the many tears I shared at some of the scenes. Hes one of the most incredibly humble and famous people in the world. We all know in this day in age that many celebrities go through bad mental health at some point in their careers, but not many share it with the world. Lewis, we love you and appreciate you, but your main priority should always be your health. Thank you for being you and for showing the world your most vulnerable side in return helping others. I wish I could give you a massive hug!x.",False

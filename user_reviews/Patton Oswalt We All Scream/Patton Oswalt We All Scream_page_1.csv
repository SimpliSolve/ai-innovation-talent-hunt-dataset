1,7,Why all the bad reviews?,holcomb-87433,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI feel like this is pretty true to Oswalt's brand of humor. Is it his best stand-up? Not really but it is definitely better and more creative than a lot out there. There's some spots that are kind of blah like the vaccine stuff but most stand-up performances have a spot where I kind of feel that way.Overall, I feel like this reflects the age he and a lot of his fans are at. And that's not a bad thing. Gen X is getting older and is suddenly faced with a new outlook that it never had previously. I found a lot of relatable thoughts for those now stuck in the ""middle-aged"" area of life. Definitely worth the watch even if you only like half the jokes.",True
2,5,Disappointed,terry-95-641559,n/a,15/08/2025,I've loved everything Patton has done. His inclusion in anything boosts it. This special was so hyped and I was so looking forward to it so perhaps I set myself up for disappointment. It dragged right up to the final disappointing scatalogicsl bit.Couldn't believe the 10 minutes of front row 'what do you do for a living' filler crowdwork in a special. It's like this review. It is too short so I'm having to add filler to reach the arbitrary minimum. This review is worse for it. How did that crowd work stay in?Not terrible but Payton's bar is so high and this was not there. I need to go back and watch any of his previous fat superior work.,False
3,1,Gave it 15 minutes,crowgrl13,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a shame, I used to like Patton Oswalt. I had Netflix send me a reminder when it dropped so I could watch it. Hearing/watching him go on a 6 minute tangent/""joke"" about clown pubes (no I'm not kidding) right at the beginning that wasn't even funny.... I ended up turning it off. I was so bored, I tried to keep it on and get past it, but it just wasn't any good. I don't know what happened, but maybe he's just not funny anymore. Or if he has outside people writing his jokes, he needs to fire them. It seemed like the audience was just laughing to be polite, and that's too bad. Get new jokes, buddy.Disappointed.",False
4,2,Two words- Clown P***s,david_stever,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI think i like Patton Oswald more then my wife does, but we decided to stop and give a listen to this special that's just been released this week. We stopped watching this special after ten minutes of a sidetrack from a story that involved a barn full of the public hairs from clowns. He paused at least once and then resumed his march off the end of the wharf. Maybe he was going to get back on trac soon, but who the hell has the patience to wait that long for him to get this unfunny stuff out of his system?He can be funny, his stories can be fun observational stuff, but lord this was not it tonight. Someone could let me know how far to fast forward to get pass the burning car on the side of the road,",True
5,2,Didn't hear a single joke.,dcjw82,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've watched Pattons stand up specials in the past and enjoyed them, I've been a fan of his for a while.This special however was one of the worst stand up comedy routines I've ever seen. It's hard to believe a professional comedian wrote this material and thought it was worthy of a special. Probably the most glaring issue with this is that there are no actual jokes, just unfunny stories.Might be worth the watch though because I did get some enjoyment out of the immense second-hand embarrassment each time one of his ""jokes"" didn't land and the audience was dead silent, which was nearly every joke.Overall a major disappointment and hopefully Patton can redeem himself in the future.",False
6,10,This is hilarious.,edhutchinson-08617,n/a,15/08/2025,"To be very honest I wasn't expecting much when I put this on but found myself laughing out several times. I don't understand all the low ratings. When foing his routine, he connects with real life experiences and how.most of us coped while going through the pandemic. I could certainly relate yovthe partd of the show when he talks about getting older. We're the same age. I don't watch stand up very often but I'm very hlad I did with this one. I was so impressed I'm going to check out more of his routines when I get a chance. Definitely better than a lot of othervtripe you see on Netflix, Prime, etc.",False
7,2,Patton Needs To Stop.,A_New_Hope,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love stand up when done right. This isn't done right. I would watch Dane Cook regurgitate other comedians jokes over watching this past 40 mins. He isn't funny, my wife had this playing in the background, i came in and sat down to relax and well was too lazy to look for the remote. After 40 minutes of trying to give it a chance i got up and went outside again so thanks Patton for giving me the energy to be nowhere near you. He just isn't funny, his jokes don't land and all I can see is the two faced back stabbing creeper he is. There have been comedians with scandals I've still found funny but the thing is they were actually talented and funny, no idea how Patton keeps getting roles and gigs. Avoid It isn't funny and its not even worth being background noise.",False
8,1,Please give me my time and my brain back,russellensley,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is by far the worst time i have had since this all started. Patton Oswalt is neither funny or enlightening. He is obviously misinformed. He is mean. Dirty. Folks like myself would be happy to see Patton Oswat's career return to the community theater where it is still above it's rank. Oswalt is not only misinformed, he spews hatred towards those whom he considers dumb but has been proven in recent weeks to be much smarter than he is. Don't waste your time. This is probably the final straw with Netflix. Not only is this simply bad entertainment, it is hateful, full of bad information, given to you by a man that is not funny at all.",False
9,2,Just not funny,fambizzsales,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've enjoyed Patton Oswalt in exactly one thing, his minor role in Justified. In it he plays a sheriff of a very small town if I recall correct. He didn't write his own material and the role, while it has some comedic elements, isn't strictly comedic. I don't know if he possibly got his start in stand up but I don't possibly see how, he's just not funny at all. That's quite an accomplishment cause the only people I know of that are this terrible at comedy are Amy Shumer and maybe Melissa McCarthey. Its kind of amazing how terrible some content is, and all just to appease the streaming gods. Our options quadrupled but its like there's less quality television than ever.",False
10,2,Anti Comedy?,willieno288,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love stand up. Dave Chappelle, Louis CK, Bill Hicks, Doug Stanhope, Stewart Lee, David Cross, Maria Bamford, the list goes on. But it seems like Netflix will give a stand up special to anyone these days. This particular special was just another low quality netflix show. There is very little humour. Which is kind of a requirement for a comedy special. It was tired and cliched. No originality. No insight. No unique points of view. Just the same old schtick. Patton Oswald is quite well known in the realm of comedy. I dont understand why. Ive seen him in AP Bio, Lady Dynamite, Reno 911, Veep and a few other shows. He's never been funny. That is just my opinion obviously. There are probably people who think he has the ability to be humorous but I dont.",False
11,1,Wow..,mgentalen,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have generally have enjoyed most of Netflix's stand up special's and I can say I am a fan of Patton's , but wow. Let me just start by saying, why is comedy post Covid, the same topic for each stand up and yet, comedy as a whole, just feels softer.Cut to "" We All Scream."" Patton describes a 13 minute, yes, 13, which honestly should have been no more than thirty seconds, about... clown pubes in a barn? This was your opening material? The more he said it I kept wincing, and he didn't move on, kept going back to this stupid metaphor, which made zero sense. Yet, Patton mentioned this material took him two years to come up with. This is why we have producers and Creative Executive's, so someone can say "" Don't do this.""Another detail that really is frustrating me with these specials in general, I get it, Covid was a big thing yes. It's over, yet Patton is doing material on the lockdown, vaccines and telling us he watched Deadwood. Can we please just get one special not to say the words "" Lockdown"" "" covid"" or "" vaccinations"" anymore, please? I don't know about you, but I get annoyed being September 2022, and a stand up is talking about lock downs. Let's go back to actually creating real comedy without talking about injections or not being able to do anything.",False
12,3,"Loved his previous specials, very disappointed",agc-99523,n/a,15/08/2025,"The special was recorded recently, in 2022, can we stop the ridiculous covid vaccine jokes already?? Or are those necessary to please a certain demographic or the Netflix overlords? After being a big fan in the past, this made me lose all respect for him...
My wife and I really enjoyed his previous specials and we loved watching him in other TV shows like King of Queens, but were really disappointed by this special. I wasn't expecting that we wouldn't even end up watching it all the way to the end, but here we are...Too bad, we likely won't bother with whatever Patton Oswalt ends up producing next.",False
13,1,Just wow.,backup-50362,n/a,15/08/2025,"Damn, he got progressively worse with each Netflix special, and this is where he finally peaks (the wrong way around).I was never a fan, but I admit he was occasionally funny on shows and stand-up specials from days long gone.But then the Trump era hit, and of course he was eager to show how genuinely angry, bitter and unfunny he can be on stage. Like a literal embodiment of an internet troll.His following special was sad more so than funny, and this one... again, like someone else wrote in the reviews - there's not a single joke.I guess he says the right political things Netflix wants to hear, and this is why he keeps getting these, despite bombing. Don't let the fake added-in-post Netflix audience cheers and laughter fool you.",False
14,1,WHY???,beauleaumail,n/a,15/08/2025,"Normally I absolutely love Patton Oswalt but unfortunately in this disaster he uses material, I am sure he looks back on and wishes he would have waited another 6 months to see how his jokes may hold up. The information, not the jokes, the actual information he shares with the audience makes him look like one of the weakest, saddest, and worst humans that has ever picked up a microphone! Yes, I am including the drunk, mindless failures that have run for public office in the recent past. Things like, INJECTING MYOCARDITIS IS SOMETHING EVERYONE SHOULD DO IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR HEALTH! This was not a joke! This was not a setup to a joke. This was the information backdrop of the setup. Like is some says""I'm clearly a human and as a human there are things we can all relate to"".... Then the setup.... This was one of the worst standup specials I have ever watched anyone do, EVER. I watched all of Andrew Dice Clay standup when I was a kid. That is all 7's and 8's compared to this TRASH!!!!!!",False

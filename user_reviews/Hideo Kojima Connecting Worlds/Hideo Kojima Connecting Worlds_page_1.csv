1,6,"Very much a Kojima tribute piece, but it's still interesting! [+64%]",arungeorge13,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gaming, in many ways, is an even more immersive experience than cinema. You're in the role of the game's protagonist, and your actions decide the progress of the story, unlike in cinema, where things are happening and you're basically a passive (but keen) observer. And Hideo Kojima is one of the true auteurs in the field of gaming; someone who doesn't stick to conventions and rulebooks. He, instead, creates his own.This documentary serves as a shallow dive into the bizarrely creative mind of Kojima, but even at just under an hour, it feels long. It's a blast when you get to hear from Kojima and his close colleagues (about how he and his peers function), but also sort of a fluff piece when you have visionary filmmakers (such as George Miller, Guillermo del Toro, and Nicolas Winding Refn) and musical artists (like Grimes, Woodkid) chiming in with their thoughts on the man. Death Stranding, a divisive game that released in 2019 right before the onset of the COVID pandemic, is given all its ""prophetic"" dues. The film only brushes over Kojima's past achievements (with Konami), which I'm guessing, goes against its aspirational purpose.Whether it's in gaming or any other art form that involves some level of storytelling, I'm glad minds like Hideo Kojima exist; you know, the kind who fight the algorithm and stay original without so much as caring for perception (or mere validation).",False
2,7,Love letter to an gaming icon,masonsaul,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds isn't the deep dive into Kojima's career or creative process that it could've been but it remains an engaging look at gaming's first and most popular auteur. There's a great selection of interviewees here and any time it focuses on the development of Death Stranding are the strongest parts.Glen Milner's direction pulls out all the stops with its dramatic slow motion, animated sequences and grand statements which show a clear reverence for his subject. However, one grating choice is the decision to introduce everyone almost every single time they're interviewed which is baffling considering it's only an hour long.",False
3,6,Alright...not the biography you were expecting.,AlienRefugee,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rather strange. It dives into his childhood and creative vision, all while showing behind the scenes footage of the development of Death Stranding. The overall pacing and formula is really off. It makes absolutely no mention of Silent Hill and briefly talks about Metal Gear Solid but glosses over what was clearly a huge part of his career. As someone who only knows a bit about his contributions outside of Death Stranding, I was left without any sort of clarification or information about where he started out and how he got to be such a respected member of the gaming community. At just under an hour in length, it felt like a YouTube special or a bonus unlockable from the game.",False

5,10,The film I needed,sebastiangabrielblanco,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a game developer whose work has been greatly influenced by Mr. Kojima, I can say that the film is a light of hope for new creative directors. It shows many ideas: giving feedback of everything, 200 decisions per day, having people that support you no matter what, showing your inner world and having a particular worldview, edgy game but for the masses...
It also communicates the importance of art: enhance the human spirit and inspire. The film was entertaining. It was really nice to receive a rope in a world of sticks. It is a must if you admire Kojima as a creative director. You will also see some early scenes of Death Stranding.",True

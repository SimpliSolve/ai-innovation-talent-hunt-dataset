1,3,Out of Focus,revotstover,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh, it looks like a documentary. There's Oakland and some shots of the city and Oakland High. But there is nothing holding all of it together.It's called Homeroom. We barely see kids in school and, when we do, the classes are super small and/or students are on their phones. Students don't seem very engaged, but we've seen that narrative before.The movie mostly follows council kids, the ones that represent the school and district. Usually, council kids aren't that representative of students--they're the kids that hold office, run assemblies, make posters--and Homeroom only follows a handful of them.The director has claimed this movie was an attempt to better understand young people. The viewer doesn't see young people for more than a minute or two at a time. We don't see them in class, at home, having fun, doing work, or anything for long.About the only focus is defunding the police. The students speak at a board meeting and claim this a good idea. Why? We see one scene at school feature police officers--they are in the auditorium, speaking to a limited number of students, and are willing to answer any question.Do we wee the SRO (school cop) in action? Nope. Do we ever see kids interract with police? We do not. We don't know anything specific that has happened between police and these students to make the students feel the way they do. The students don't have dialogue about it, but we do get to see them watching stories on their phones.Once again, this was an opportunity to get a close look into student's/people's lives during school and a pandemic. And, maybe Covid kept the crew socially distant after March, but that doesn't excuse the months leading up to it.Too bad. The general pubflic has no idea what happens in public schools these days and Homeroom does little to shed a light.",False
2,1,Worst attempt at opportunistic political pandering ever,apotodyssey,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unless you have the IQ of a lima bean, it's quite obvious why this film was made. It's so bad that I just laughed most of the time.",False
3,10,Interesting perspective into the troubles of our school system,PixNFlix,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ignore the review bombs from the alt right. Crazy how you can watch a doc about the problems kids and families face and your biggest takeaway is how you disagreed with a political position.Regardless of political stance, this doc allows you to gain important insights into the current troubles of our school systems and processes.",False
4,10,Hope for the future,djtaylor-10607,n/a,16/08/2025,This is incredible look at life at a diverse/urban high school. These amazing young kids have to deal with all sorts of challenges but they persevere and thrive. Great insight into a world that many of us never experience. Worth watching.,False
5,10,Impactful look at 2020,jasonrussellaj-43173,n/a,16/08/2025,You are immediately drifted into a world of the challenges facing the youth in America through the eyes of brave Oakland high school students. Amazing and impactful are words that do not do this documentary justice. Must see!,False

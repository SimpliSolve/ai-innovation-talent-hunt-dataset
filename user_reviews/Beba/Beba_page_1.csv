1,6,"It's still not easy to be a young Woman of color! ""Beba"" written by Gregory Mann",gregorymannpress-74762,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""Beba""'I carry an ancient pain that I struggle to understand'. So begins the confessional narration that opens ""Beba"". The documentary undertakes an unflinching exploration of Rebeca Huntt's own identity. Seeking to gain a more concrete understanding of her identity as a young Afro-Latina woman and an up-and-coming filmmaker, the film reflects on her childhood and adolescence in New York City as the daughter of a Dominican father and Venezuelan mother. After graduating from Bard College, she returns to the rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment on Central Park West where she and her two siblings were raised. The film investigates the historical, societal, and generational trauma she's inherited and ponders how those ancient wounds have shaped her, while simultaneously considering the universal truths that connect us all as humans.Throughout ""Beba"", the film searches for a way to forge creative path amid a landscape of intense racial and political unrest. It's about the historical, societal, and generational trauma she's inherited and ponder how those centuries-old wounds have shaped her. Weaving together music, poetry, and interview footage, the film traces her life's journey from her family home to the mountains of South America, where she spent youthful summers, and then onto the campus where she formed pivotal friendships and began to discover her authentic voice. As she strikes out into adulthood, intense racial and political unrest mounts, leaving her eagerly searching for a way to forge her own creative path and to find her place in the world. ""Beba""is a self-portrait of an Afro-Latina artist hungry for knowledge and yearning for connection.The documentary gives the audience the opportunity of watching a young woman of color live her life honestly, it isn't always pretty, indeed it's often pretty dark, but it's unrelentingly real. In so doing, she challenges audiences to do the same, to look deeply within and ask: 'What is the legacy I am leaving, can I fight for something better'? It's a symphony that keeps our minds working every step of the way. The film provides a mirror for many who've never seen themselves reflected before on screen. As such, we've to create our own roadmap, consistently charting new territory.Put all your friends in it, everybody you loved, so one day they will find you and know that you're all here together. You've to find this quote to embody a level of self-acceptance and love for humanity that's scarce in, and yet fundamental to art. Amid the murders of Treyvon Martin and Michael Brown the streets trembled and the tension is palpable. We either srive and become useful, or we disappear into the chaos. The film wants to explore effects of this moment on an existential level, we might move people. Every major plot point in ""Beba"" reflects an existential set back, or a quantum leap often only identified by the person experiencing them. The film uses 16mm, shot handheld, for it's ability to capture a limited yet pulsating aesthetic intrinsic to intimacy. There's something about 16mm that's innately intimate. The film is full of sentimental references, like the voice of Audre Lorde, and some less obvious ones, reinterpretations of scenes from the works of Djibril Diop Mambety and Chris Marker.Film in general has this beautiful, pulsating aesthetic. Every single thing it captures on screen feels pulsating like it's alive. The colors are just also arresting. Every human being goes through some sort of an existential crisis in their early twenties. Is this what life is We exist within this framework of chaos, and it's constant. But what's so much bigger than out shyness is our yearning to connect with people. Ww think we're innately correlated, and everything would look different if we were more honest with ourselves and honest with others. To create a space where we can all talk a little bit more honestly about what it's like to exist. Talk about some of the dynamics in our relationships, which have so much to do with these instincts that we inherit and these systems that we live under. So maybe we can begin a deeper dialogue around what's already true, our innate correlation. (5,5)Written by Gregory Mann.",True
2,1,A quite literally insufferable human being,maxwestn,n/a,16/08/2025,"She no longer has any friends to suffer through her narcissistic nano-grievances, so instead she turns to the camera, who can't get up and leave. Luckily for you, you still can.",False
3,10,"Raw,",mentiramivida6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Painful, beautiful, tragic, scary, honest, sadly common.From the opening to the end I was hooked. I believe only those from the same or similar background would truly comprehend what is so bravely shown. I would love to see another if growth as a person and family is achieved later down the path of life.It was emotional and close to home that I had to share it with my family who only in the past 5-10 years have tried to unlearn all the garbage society forced us into.This honest depiction of life as a poor person, Latino person, black person and a woman will sadly only resonate with a select few and hopefully with those that claim to be open-minded. Overall give it a watch if you like documentaries about one persons perspective of their life.",False

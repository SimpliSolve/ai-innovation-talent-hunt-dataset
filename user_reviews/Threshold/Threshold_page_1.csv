1,n/a,Interesting and educational,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a calm documentary without many emotional peaks, but very educational. From the transgenerational perspective of a grandmother, a mother and a grandson, it teaches you how each one sees life depending on the generation to which they belong. The central theme is the transition of the grandson, since he is a transgender boy and the one who films everything asking himself questions and collecting information from the 3 generations is the mother. The 3 characters are feminists, including the grandmother because she comes from a revolutionary environment despite being from an older generation. It seemed to me that one of the lessons it teaches is to understand the different approaches to a taboo topic such as being transgender: some understand it completely and faster, while others find it more difficult. However, it is appreciated that these different approaches, even though they are not so close to a 100% understanding, are accompanied by love since the people involved are family.",False

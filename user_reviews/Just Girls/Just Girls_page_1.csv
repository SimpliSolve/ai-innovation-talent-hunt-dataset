1,8,A huge nostalgia trip,rebeccalong-94563,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sweet, sweet piece of filmmaking. A nostalgic experience and a wonderful exploration of the teen years, first friendships and imaginations. In one sentence; a huge nostalgia trip!",False
2,4,I didn't get it,hupshtar-674-809993,n/a,16/08/2025,"Couldn't really find a storyline. Nice images but a lot of talk with little context. I may have missed something.It may be that something was lost in translation but beside seeing images and scenes of the beautiful countryside and the girls enjoying summer and talking about their everyday life, it was difficult to follow as I expected some kind of story or message or idea. That was lost for me. Reading ahead the description, it mentions something about the growing conservatism of Polish society and the attempt to find their place within these circumstances, but I couldn't get any of that. And I cannot say I didn't try.",False
3,9,"""Just Girls"" is a film to definitely feel more than trying to reasoning with it.",osbornepobert,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really didn't knew what to expect when I went to the screening of Just Girls. An important preface note before the review: I was in Poland for a short period, visiting colleagues, when a friend which is a close friend of one of the protagonists, got an extra ticket, and eventually I could join them. I was told beforehand that the film would be subtitled in English, so I felt that I was ready for anything in Polish.As the final credit sequence starts I felt suddenly on a cliff-hanger as I still have so many questions on my head, and my eyes where still not dry and ready to deal with the room lights tbeing turned on.""Just Girls"" It's a journey that tells you a lot, and the more it tells you the more you want too know and there is when the filmmakers show you a limit. Yes it frustrated me sometimes, but at the same time, on this frustration, you find the key to dwell into the story and it's characters in a less preconceived way, and this I think is really worthy. It's a film of our times, but where all is whispered to you. Nothing is said loud. Most of it, is subtext. Just Girls doesn't need to follow LGBT coming of age film trends that uses sex, drugs, etc, etc to take you to the dark side of things. Instead, just by whispering thoughts, ""Just Girls"" can turn your brain to some darker corner without the need to be controversial on screen. Not seeing certain things, but feeling that they are happening behind your back, is an-uncomfortable feeling.I'm the kind of the person that likes answers, but on this case, I felt more than Ok, with what I felt, and not so much worried with what I didn't understood completely. I would say that ""Just Girls"" is a film to definitely feel more than trying to reasoning with it.",False

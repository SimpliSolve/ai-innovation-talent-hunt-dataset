3,10,A fantastic portrait film,treydavis-69947,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had never heard of Angelo Moore before, after seeing this film I can't believe I've gone so lone never hearing his music. His personality is infectious and this film captures his expressionism so vividly. Tisa Zito is a wonderful director, you feel her connection with Angelo making his words come to life visually. This is by far one of the best portrait films I have seen.",False
4,10,Exceptional film!,matttaber-60963,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an exceptional exploration of a true artistic genius - Angelo Moore. Although fans of his music will enjoy this documentary, familiarity with Moore's music is not a prerequisite because of Tisa Zito's ability to capture the energy, creativity, passion and brilliance that Moore brings to his music and live performances. The film is guaranteed to make you seek out Moore's music and to question how he is not more widely known. This is reflective of both Moore's musical genius and Zito's gift for filmmaking. Highly recommended!",False

6,10,Captivating!,Mico-660-387453,n/a,16/08/2025,"An artist, filmmaker Tisa Zito, captures the soul of another artist in Angelo Moore. Brilliantly shot and a story well told about an unsung giant in the music industry. As close as you'll get to the psyche of a creative phenomenon without being one.Fernando A. Mico

7,10,Angelo Moore Gets the Recognition He Deserves,jockcamp,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's time for Angelo Moore to get the recognition he deserves, as an American artist and an icon on his generation. As the lead singer of Fishbone, and as his spoken word and solo music alter-ego, Dr. Madd Vibe, Angelo has influenced countless singers and performers who came after him. A musical style-bender, Angelo is considered one of the best live performers of all time and the footage is here in the film to prove it. How did he (and Fishbone) get passed over by modern music history? Fishbone are sub-culture heroes.The director, Tisa Zito, captures a slice Angelo's life in Los Angeles, CA (Lost Assholes, as Angelo calls it). She also sprinkles in a bit of his history through interviews with his family, Norwood Fisher (Fishbone bassist), and other bandmates. We also meet Angelo's daughter, Cheyenne Star Forever Moore (because everything in Angelo's life is a creative expression, even his daughter's name). We learn the background of Dr. Madd Vibe and see a bit of footage from back in the days of solo Dr. Madd Vibe poetry tours. We get some perspective of Angelo's place in black history though interviews with leading black music and culture historians.In terms of cinematography, the documentary is a mix of film footage and photography. But you never feel like you're simply looking at photos. The director spans each picture and brings it to life with interesting stories from Angelo and his people. Visually, the film matches Angelo's electric personality. Tisa Zito brings you up close and personal with Angelo and it feels like you're spending a week with the man himself. By the end of the film, Angelo feels like a friend and whether you've been a fan for years or this is the first time you've ever heard of him, you're on his side, rooting for his success. Angelo is magnetic, and even through a screen he pulls you towards him and into his world full of Madd Vibes. Thanks Ms. Zito, for helping us get there.",False

10,10,fishbone is red hot!,pammalone-91809,n/a,16/08/2025,"I been a FISHBONE fanatic since 1991, and got to see one of their shows while i was just a skinny punk girl in college. First album I heard, was Reality of My Surroundings. Then I found the Truth and Soul album, and it was over for me. I'm a fan for life and into death. Bought every album since, but I have to say one of my fave albums i can play on repeat is the Give a Monkey a Brain, and He'll Swear He's the Center of the Universe. Now, if you know the songs, then you know this portrait film is the bomb. You don't have to take my word for it...just check it out and give it a watch and listen. Peace.",False
11,10,Creative Genius,spinderoux,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anything Fishbone or Angelo Moore creates is worth the time. Angelo Moore is an incredible, creative person who influenced so so many who were or are fortunate enough to have listened or seen Angelo perform. I hope to see it for sale on Amazon or to watch on Netflix. I will always be one of many big fans!",False
12,10,Finally the credit he deserves!,ochavez-42956,n/a,16/08/2025,"Angelo Moore was nicely portrayed in the Fishbone documentary which followed the band for 2 or 3 years but this one focuses on the the main man and was done by a talented person who discovered Angelo on stage, realised the potential of telling the story of a genius who never stops creating and making the life of the people he meets better. She became a close friend of Angelo along the process and that is apparent from the movie.Bring this to Netflix or Amazon as soon as possible please so that the rest of the world can fall in love with Angelo and his irresistible smile!",False
13,10,Essential,robsrectangle,n/a,16/08/2025,"A must see. Without Angelo, we'd have no Martin Short and no No Doubt, no doubt.",False
14,10,Visually Stunning Film with Depth and Breadth and a Solid Shot in the Arm,wilson-35275,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the opening shot, I was hooked. This film is a visual feast. Add to that the absolute joy of an artistically gifted eccentric with a mind as deep and broad as the music he creates, and you have the masterfully created ""Forevemoore; The Angelo Project"". Filmmaker Tisa Zito gives us a glimpse into the life and soul of the ska legend. What a soul. What a talent. What a film.",False

1,10,Anything is possible with KG,ryannhl1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love Kevin Garnett. He is the epitome of hard work and believing in your dreams. This documentary beautifully tells the story of KG's life, his hardships and what makes him who he is. It is a fantastic documentary for doc fans, sports fans, and for anyone who needs a little push toward their goals in life.""Opportunity comes when you least expect it. It's what you do with that opportunity""And of course:""ANYTHING IS POSSIBLEEEEE""",False

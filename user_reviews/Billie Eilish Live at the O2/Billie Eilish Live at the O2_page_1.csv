1,10,An amazing concert film!,EduardoRoglin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's spectacular! Congratulations, Billie Eilish! This was one of the most beautiful events I've ever seen in my life. He sang his incredible songs perfectly, with the fantastic combination of instruments on the part of Finneas and Andrew Marshall (Billie also at a specific moment), an incredible edition and a perfect audio capture. The energy of the show is very good, Billie is one of the most charismatic and dear people I've ever seen, her communication with the audience is fabulous, combining this with her talent, makes me not want to leave the cinema, but yes to continue listening to more music and seeing their interactions. One of the best concert films I've ever seen, extremely flawless.",True

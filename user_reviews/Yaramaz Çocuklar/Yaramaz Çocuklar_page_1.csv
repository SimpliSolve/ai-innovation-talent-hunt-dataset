1,10,Geography is not destiny anymore,saraceda,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very intimate and touching family documentary. Actually as a spectator, I didn't know the director was a member of the family while I was watching the documentary. I had no idea in advance, hence I watched it as if it was a random family story from Turkey. All of the characters are unique of their own. Especially Zeynep is one of kind. Her poised and strong character speaks for herself. Instead of being the victim of her conditions, she willfully tries to build a new life for herself. I will always remember zeynep's confrontation with her mother as I myself have had similar conversations with my mother. I also think that her mother understands her and finds her right in a way. I especially liked the way of natural approach of directing, showing only the truth without dramatizing the events. Nowadays, seeing the pure truth is a rare thing . It also strikes me so see that mahmut and nezahat are very honest with themselves despite the bitter consequences. Anyway, I think ibni haldun was wrong, we can change our destiny , no matter which region we come from or what type of family we belong to. I think that Zeynep and his elder brother are fine examples of that. Definitely worth watching documentary. T he documentary asks very basic and poignant questions such as 'what does family mean to an individual? ' can u see how your family has made your life so difficult and forgive your parents at the Same time?' ' can we love our family but understand how they have shaped, constructed us?' The documentary asks and answers all these questions in a very humane and calm way, and that is the beauty of this production. In addition, the audience also feels like they are watching how Turkey has evolved and changed in the last 20 years. It is very much like watching Turkey from a family's living room. The audience has no choice but to feel their lives and empathy towards them. Gracefully and superbly done.",False

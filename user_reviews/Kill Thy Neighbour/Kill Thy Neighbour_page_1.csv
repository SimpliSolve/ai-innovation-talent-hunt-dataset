1,6,"A mixed bag, gets better as it develops.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Many of us love true crime documentaries, and it's fair to say the quality varies quite a lot. Sometimes they're over produced, sometimes boring, sometimes gripping. This series I would say is decent, fairly average, but has some food episodes. The final two are definitely the best, both are very sad stories, but quite insightful and well made.If you only watch the first two, I'd suggest you may be bored and a little disappointed, both are a little slow, and guilty of being very repetitive, as it progresses though, it does get better.The narration is a little odd, I'm not sure it works, they could have done with having more interviews, and more footage of the perpetrators themselves.Not a bad series, 6/10.",False
2,1,Woefully poor delivery,TomatoesareRotten,n/a,15/08/2025,"OK, we all love a bit of true crime, but this first episode is 45 minutes long. We know the protagonist within the first 10 and then we have dozens of repeat shots of the victim, the murderer ( in particular ), the allotment signs, the plants, the sheds....... There is absolutely zero content in this, apart from a victim and a perpetrator AND the most irritating narration I've ever inflicted on my ears.",False
3,2,The return of Monty Python,cormacfiggis,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI didn't make it to the end of the first episode. It's like an extended Monty Python sketch. The tone of the presenters has the earnestness and dimwittedness of the Piranha Brothers sketch, and is made even better because it's set on an allotment. As sad as it is that an old lady is killed, the story is about as intriguing as someone popping out for a pint of milk and losing their wallet.",True

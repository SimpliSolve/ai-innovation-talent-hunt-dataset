1,4,Don't know what this documentary exactly means,robbensummer-60450,n/a,16/08/2025,"It should be a story that people kept finding the truth and revealed the eventuality. The first 3/4 of the video shows the process of the exploration, but then it becomes far away from the main idea, like helping the main character get used to the environment and expressing the love between the family members. Well that's really weird. Maybe why it turns out this ending is that they couldn't find the evidence to solve this problem but the manufacturer had put so much time and money in it so that it had to be released to the public. I watched this video with curiosity at the beginning and ended up with knowing nothing.",False
2,2,Balls,Lexiii67,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you don't want balls rolling down the stairs, or dolls falling, don't place them precariously on uneven steps?? I love Steve Gonsalves and I'm a huge fan of the og Ghosthunters show, but I just don't understand why this family claims to not be able to live in this house. Nothing scary seems to be happening, not scary enough to scare me away from my home. If you don't want to hear spooky organ music, don't have an organ in your house. I'm sorry for the home owner's loss of her daughter, but I don't feel like this is ""the most haunted home in America"". I don't think there was enough ""evidence"" for one movie, never mind two.",False
3,2,"I love Ghost Hunters and Steve G, but...",benbjh,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDo me a favour, for those who have watched this, ignore that the items are ridiculously balanced on the steps and check out the baseball falling down. You can see the light bounce off the fish line as it is pulled...I am not suggesting that it is all set up, but when you can see one problem, others start to appear and you then lose the ability to see anything else. I would suggest controlled testing and showing it to offset possibility of people looking for their five minutes.I really hope you make more documentaries, but review the material a little more in detail before you put your name to it.",True
4,1,A sequel? Why?,ShftyEyedGoat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why would you make a sequel to a poorly investigated home? Oh! Because you forgot to do actual scientific investigations! (some comments might bleed over from the first 'movie')
Let's bring in some psychics that supposedly have no knowledge of the location. OOPS! They left all their camera gear up showing all the ""hot spots"" possibly contaminating a blind test.The light keeps turning on and off, let's bring out a 'professional' who can look at the device. Oh he just looked at the breaker and the switches... do you need to look at the light itself, the electrical wiring, or maybe even install something to monitor the voltage of the light to see what might be happening during the light turning off? NOPE! We're using science!Oh the ball keeps getting pushed off the stairs...should we add more cameras to view from all angles, try using a ball with an accelerometer as you can clearly see the ball starts rolling vs being fully pushed, should we add different types of cameras to look at heat or other things as this is a reoccurring phenomena ??? NOPE cuz we're doing science wrong! (correction) oh they finally brought in someone to use a ball to monitor things, odd it has taken so long.Oh do you hear that high pitch sound? Yeah man, I do hear it! Should they bring in a full spectrum recording device that could actually record that frequency? NOPE!Let's just keep bringing in 'experts' that barely do anything or bring in much of any tools that are a known quantity. Let's bring in random tools that measure ""something"" and give no explanation as to what they do or how that measurement of something came about. I know looking for paranormal evidence will require measuring something other than your basic things like temp, heat, etc. But you still have to give some base to it.They talk about wanting to be taken seriously but don't follow basic scientific processes. Stop doing a bad job at properly measuring and recording things and maybe we'll take you seriously. Always be recording audio and other visual spectrums to compare what you see with all available data. Just give it a go please.",False
5,1,It so bad I thought it was a parody,brian-53597,n/a,16/08/2025,"Want psychics? This movie has them. So powerful that they constantly correct, reaffirm and change each others stories in real time. In fact almost every person on screen does this.Want ghosts? This house apparently has plenty as each expert seems to have found a new one everytime they come to the house for the first time.In the end you find yourself questioning if the afterlife is real. Myself personally hoping this is true so I maybe can get back the 2 hours I just wasted staring at the result of what occurs when filmmaking becomes more affordable and this weirdness occurs.If you need a reason to understand why people don't necessarily point to ghost at anything that can't be explained at that moment every individual in this film will help with that. Its because you may look insane and/or sheep headed parroting what the nutjob psychic beside is saying why he's feeling ""spirits"" in tye air.",False
6,9,True Paranormal Investigating,devilshourproductions,n/a,16/08/2025,I have always said the best way to document the paranormal is to have a lot of access and time at the location and getting people in the scientific community that are more qualified than the investigators. They did all of that. For the filmmaking aspect of this film it had great cinematography and edited well. It isn't a horror documentary. It is a true documentary and it felt very authentic. This investigation was well done. Great film. The only thing I would say I like more of is getting music that gives the film a bit more emotion but that could just be my own personal preference. Great job putting this together and it sends a good message to the paranormal community and to everyone else that watches the film. Keep up the good work!,False
7,10,Slam Dunk!,darbreef,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great documentary! Not because it's paranormal. It was very well put together. You can actually see the hard work put into it. Usually sequels don't match up to the first, but this one did. It creates that age old question with everyone, ""are ghosts real?"" I really enjoyed it. I hope there's a 3rd. Damn good!",False
8,10,It matches,janiecastle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most documentaries don't match the first however this one did. I mean it did in fact move away from Paranormal a bit when the ending talked about their relationship however that doesn't make it bad. It's very real and that's what ppl miss out on. They think because it's not packed full of fake drama it wasn't any good , it's sad our youth feel drama equals good, however when you look at everything that makes a good movie it has it all plus it's real . You can't get much better than that. I'll take less drama over sitting on the edge of my seat any day however it did have parts where I was clinging on . I give it 10/10 and it deserves that.",False

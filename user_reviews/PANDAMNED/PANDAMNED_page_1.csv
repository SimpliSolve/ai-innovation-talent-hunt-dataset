1,10,Give the film a chance.,nbartsch,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watch to the end and judge yourself. It is a documentary film with many interviews expressed with pure universal logic, one can or not agree with arguments exposed but if one say it is non.sense without thinking or asking yourself why is he right or wrong, than indeed you are being controlled. I watched hundreds of documentary films in my life and this one is a legitimate one done with intelligence and again, watch, think and then decide, your brain and soul are much more.powerfull than you think and this film is a truth and legitimate documentary...in my opinion worth the time. The interviews are clear, there are many new information I didn't know before which can be easily checked.",False

But it is a documentary made up of many interviews. In these conversations, heretics and outcasts like Prof. Sucharit Bhakdi and Dolores Cahill also have their say. Finally a controversy!Since the societies of the world have agreed on vaccinations, masks, boosters and harsh restrictions and are largely playing along, the bottom line - spoiler alert - is downright:

4,1,Fear and Disinformation,luckyluke6,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary promises an insight into a system, based on fear and disinformation. And ironically, that's exactly what you get. Scary, how some people believe this utter nonsense, which contradicts both science and reason.",False
5,1,A bunch of conspiracy-theorists spreading fear,schauol1,n/a,15/08/2025,"...avoid this at all costs. Unless you're up for a laugh. All ""prominent"" Covid-Deniers and anti-Vaccine-Talkers in one Place.They talk about the ""game of Fear"" while spreading fear about Vaccines... without any Irony. If it wasn't such an important topic, it could be funny.",False

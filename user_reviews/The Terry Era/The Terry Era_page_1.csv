1,1,A terrible video from a guy who can't figure out one-way-signs,spamgrabs,n/a,16/08/2025,"So Chillie is just a grifter who now is anti-cop. He harasses cops for no reason.He recently was on a tirade over a street that was changed into a one-way-street. It had several signs warning people. He complained that his GPS directed people that direction and the cops were pulling people over to let them know it had changed IF those clueless people had missed all the signs.He went to the police station saying they should put up a sign... Signs already existed though. Many of them. This is just one of his many anti-cop illogical tirades. And this video is just laughable, just like the rest of his nonsense.",False
2,1,Utter rubbish,annebelgard,n/a,16/08/2025,"This "" film"" is an absolute waste of time even if you're in a coma. The acting is so ridiculous that they couldn't even get a job doing soap commercials. The writers must have been under the impression that this was supposed to be a parody rather than a serious attempt at showing law enforcement officers in their jobs. I don't think I stopped laughing more than a few seconds. It seems that the attempt by the director and producers was to waste a great deal of time, money, energy to provide propaganda that the public is supposed to swallow... This message from this "" film"" is supposed to be that all law enforcement officers are bad people who just want to toss everyone into jails. Of course there are "" bad"" corrupt officers just as in any profession. But to lump ALL law enforcement officers into one category is unjust.Just don't waste your energy on this poorly executed propaganda.",False
3,1,How to completely misinterpret law,MrShigura,n/a,16/08/2025,"This bit of moving images which I refuse to call a film is full of misinformation about the law and the history of the law. Following the dogma espoused in this bizarre propaganda piece/vanity project has led one of its credited creators to flee warrants and get in trouble with law enforcement. This same person comes close to calling for civil war on American police. This is not a coincidence. Nothing Jeff Lloyd or wannabe cop Chille DeCastro say has been able to stand up to scrutiny. Do not waste your time on such bizarre vanity propaganda. Look up Chille on YouTube instead, at least then you can have a good laugh.",False

1,8,"Can't stop laughing, watch this...it's worth a few watches even!",thewenchfromhell,n/a,16/08/2025,"What I like about him most is his upbringing was hard and he just found the humor in it all; that takes amazing strength. The fact that this is his first special..just amazing to pull it off this well.The gun humor had me laughing so hard and hearing his take on the shooting range....omfg...hilarious..His ability to just make bad situations silly, crazy funny even is really up there. I'm impressed! Can't wait to see more of him. Great humor, this is the most enjoyable new comedian I've heard/seen in a while. Well done.I'm looking forward to seeing his future works./ golf clap... ( highest rating! )",False
2,9,"Easy to watch, chill, wholesome stand-up comedy",iamnimjay,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very well paced. Not too stimulating.The topics weren't too controversial (as a Canadian viewer) - mostly wholesome humour.Ralph Barbosa's down-to-earth and ""don't take life too seriously"" attitude is refreshing. Even when topics get political, Ralph doesn't express strong opinions or keeps the topic light with humour.I didn't feel like I was watching an hour long show - time flew by. It was easy to watch.I loved Ralph's anecdotes. His stories are humbling.I also enjoyed Ralph's use of sound effects and physical gestures - it kept the show more engaging.I highly recommend.",False
3,10,A staple in The Comedy hall of fame,tabs801,n/a,16/08/2025,I have seen about ten thousand comedians try to be themselves. But like Edison to try is to fail. When Ralph or Rafael said you paid for the Ponder joke you can tell He is in completely and utter command of the audience. Smart high brow introspective clever anecdotes from dating an Illegal to Moonrocks. Spectators at his beck and call with each ebb and flow. With the delicacy of Mitch Fatel but the delivery Leo Gallagher... The comic achieved what no one has before. Regaling others his true to life fairy tale story without having to convert a diary into a memoir. He gives it to you straight without skipping a beat.,False
4,10,Amazing comedian,aishwaryakulkarni-42762,n/a,16/08/2025,"This guy is a great comic. I loved the part about his dream girl. I laughed hardest at that bit because he nailed it. He talks about how women feel / talk to each other. An hour passed by pretty quickly. Generally I don't write reviews for any show but this one was really funny. He talks about his struggles but not in a victim mindset. He keeps it real which is refreshing. Really excited to watch more of his stuff. His special is a mix of personal stories and observations of society. It's not preachy at all. Just extremely hilarious, honest and a good watch. After I finished watching the show , I wanted to make sure that the ratings do justice to his work. Great job !",False
5,2,Cowaboring...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I stumbled upon this 2023 stand-up comedy special whilst perusing through the Netflix archive of stand-up comedy. And as I had never even heard about Ralph Barbosa before, then of course I opted to sit down and watch this particular show. Perhaps I had been missing out on a comedy gem.Turns out that I hadn't been missing out on anything at all. I found Ralph Barbosa to be anything but funny, and he failed to bring me to laughter with his comedy show.Ralph Barbosa had no charisma or presence on the stage, sort of just looking like a puppet with strings milling about whilst delivering contents devoid of comedy.""Ralph Barbosa: Cowabunga"" turned out to be a swing and a miss in terms of entertaining me. And without ever being brought to laughter once, then I am not going to venture out to watch any more of his shows, if there are any.My rating of ""Ralph Barbosa: Cowabunga"" lands on a two out of ten stars.",False

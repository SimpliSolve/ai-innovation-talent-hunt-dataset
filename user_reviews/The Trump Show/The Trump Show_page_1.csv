1,9,"Just the ""highlights""...",Little_C,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's saddening to see how much can go wrong in a fairly short time.Even for avid followers of US politics some things will come back in a ""oh, damn, yes, that also happened"" way, and it's just the highlights of 4 years of utter craziness. The only thing I missed is a deeper dive in the players who enabled the idiocracy, with Mitch McConnel as linchpin.This will eventually be the starting document for historians on where it all went wrong with the US.",False
2,8,Excellent documentary from the men in the know,ivan-16541,n/a,15/08/2025,Its horrifying yet fascinating to see just how incompetant Trumps presidential term is.,False
3,9,Confirmation and sadness,marinaferrante,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very good documentary. It confirms how ignorant, self obsessed and cunning Donald Trump is. Everything you already know and feel is shown here. But it also brings a lot of sadness in how the world is influenced by this man.",False
4,9,The Tragedy,graham-harvey,n/a,15/08/2025,"The details speak for themselves.
One disaster after another.
The ego, the fool & the gullible & desperate.
Thank goodness its almost over...",False
5,10,"By far, the best Trump documentary you'll ever see",andrea-fryer,n/a,15/08/2025,"The way this doc was executed was an utter masterpiece. Not only in how it was put together in regards to editing, music & audio, pace and storyline, but also in the content itself. Fascinating footage and the true gem was the slew of interviews with all the key people (both against and for Trump). It was like getting a private tour inside the workings of the white house. A must-watch for anyone who is fascinated by the subject of Trump.",False
6,10,"Well made, mental illness, ego, power, good music, dramatic, violent, sacred clown,",umchinagirard,n/a,15/08/2025,Well edited and great music. I didn't know a lot of this stuff and it explains things in away a person from another planet might perhaps understand politics and how humans on this planet are doomed. The story was chronological and perhaps beyond my understanding.,False
7,n/a,Sick of the hypocrisy of the left!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI fully expect to see a documentary like this about sippy cup Joe and Cocaine crazed Hunter in the near future and in that one do us all a favor and tell both sides of the ""craziest"" 4 years of throwing this Great country to the enemies. Now there's something to be proud of for sure! And by the way worst thing I've seen on screen in 60 yrs! Congrats.",True
8,9,You're Fired Mr. Trump,phoenixinvictus,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat astonishes me is how patriotic Americans are when it comes to the love of their flag and country, but revel when their political opponents are attacked by a foreign power. The US has come under the threat of tribalism of Republicans vs. Democrats and Conservatives vs. Liberals. The US's global image and power has declined under the Trump administration, who has repetitively insulted US allies while fraternising with dictators and adversaries. The things that Trump has gotten away with have left me speechless. He is an embarrassment to Western democracy and an embarrassment to the US. This documentary should serve as a warning and blueprint for the future generations that our institutions are only as strong as we make them. This documentary shows us how things went wrong, but now we must learn from our mistakes and begin the healing process.",True
9,9,"An awful and staggering programme, but needed...",jrarichards,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMost watching in here will find it hard not to make at least sub-conscious linkage between ""The Trump Show"" and ""The Truman Show"" - the 1998 Jim Carrey vehicle in which a guy has actually been living his entire supposedly real life surrounded by actors on a giant film set.This is just the kind of impression one gets here - from Director Rob Coldstream - and it's uncanny and disorientating. The programme is full of dark music and that just makes the effect stronger.Taking the above idea to (or beyond) its limits, there are obviously those (entirely serious and clever people) who wonder if the whole universe we know is Matrix-like; and in a 2017 article in ""The Conversation"" the title actually reads ""Do Brexit and Trump show that we're living in a computer simulation?"".(The idea here is that these are illogical events, not likely to develop in a real-world scenario - though we CAN in fact see that both have real-world origins in the working and lower-middle classes of the Rust Belts of the UK and USA. where quality of life and wealth have stalled for decades, even as disparities with the richest have grown. Problem only that Trump speaks of these disparities even as he epitomises them, while Brexit seems as likely to worsen the situation as help it - ESPECIALLY in a double-whammy with the pandemic).Anyway, there's no Brexit here, but there's plenty of Trump (obviously) and also plenty of COVID - which again looks a bit like some nightmarish game-players at work a la ""Under the Dome"" - sniggering to themselves ""now how how will they deal with THIS?!?!""My experience of this programme was with Episode 3, so I kind of jumped straight in, and could not quite work out what the ""angle"" was. It was necessarily disconcerting and disconcerting.Quite obviously this programme is negatively-disposed to the star of that ""show"", and is made by Brits - so maybe that's kind of ""easy"". But as I write this, in a world in which China is APPARENTLY coping well enough, I find it hard to envisage an America that could be more on its knees, or closer to the abyss - and, while COVID (that's 13M US cases and 270,000 deaths right now) is the catalyst and trigger of that, thanks to immense mismanagement at the top and immense stupidity at the bottom, it has brought to the surface other issues that the programme features - a messed-up economy so galling to Trump that he has to be in denial over it (and a tiny bit of sympathy goes out to him over that one), as well as vast divisions in society (no sympathy for him on that one at all).But there's something more that COVID has brought out, and it's hugely on show in Episode 3 of ""The Trump Show"", and that is that, entirely ""Truman Show""-like, America is now full of fake people acting in their roles without conviction, and looking - literally and figuratively - as if they have lost the plot (assuming they ever knew it at all).Q: How would such a group of mixed-up fakers with no real thought processes, convictions, presence or backstory deal with a genuine existential threat posed by a virus?A: Exactly like America has done in practice.This despite the DHS having a contingency plan ready for just this kind of thing (as one ofthe more level-headed speakers on the programme recalls).The shock of this programme is how few normal and genuine (let alone likeable) people it shows - and that goes for Trump (of course), but also Democrat Pelosi, White House staffers, many of the talking-head experts and even many of the ""ordinary folk"" (obese, chaotic, naive, over-emotional) that the programme features.I'm a Brit, so perhaps it's natural that Jon Sopel seems OK (like the kind of person one could have a conversation with and actually ""get somewhere"" in terms of both enlightenment and making a personal connection), but this viewer latches on to his brief presence near-desperately as something reassuringly familiar in a sea of the bizarre and unhinged.One of the main speakers, Tim Alberto, seems OK; while - outraged, overwhelmed and almost speechless - Rev. Gini Gerbasi of St. John's Episcopal Church (which was boarded up and miserable-looking when Trump posed before it with a Bible, the streets having previously been cleared using appalling force) makes a good impression. But of course she is stunned that America could have become like this - as are we all (even as we realise that those images of 50s and 60s and 80s America were also always fake, while 9/11 and what followed did yet more harm to the country before Trump came along).Anyway, fellow man of the cloth Pastor Mark Burns looks less authentic - as one of the Evangelists that Trump got to swing behind his campaign and encourage his Messianic ""chosen one"" beliefs. These added to the President's self-help/positive thinking mantra-cum-obsession deriving from Norman Vincent Peale.There was therefore genuine surprise in some key quarters that the virus has little interest in people's positive thinking, even as Trump's circus performance in respect of his own dose of COVID kept to that script, hurting millions and plumbing new depths of hopeless, useless meanness as it culminated in his ludicrously macho ""don't let it dominate you; don't let it take over"" speech.Duh - none of us want to; Donald; but so many of us have had no choice - and did not get access to experimental treatments and the best possible conditions like you did.Please, please excuse me for this, but a bit of a pattern here is that many of these people featured are a little bit long in the tooth and might once have taken a bit more of a back seat in the garden or on the golf course. John Bolton is in there, Rudi Giuliani - so there are some more dinosaurs of the US political scene - and that only enhances the impression of people play-acting or game-playing endlessly, rather than holding genuine beliefs or truly keeping up with things.Yet Mick Mulvaney is younger, but makes a bad impression, as does Paula White. Steve Bannon is unshaven and unkempt and thinks that's OK.In the end, there's no escape from weird here, even as the biggest dose of weirdness comes from Trump himself. ""He may be a bad person, but he's our bad person"" someone says. And of course the election (which happened a mere few weeks after ""The Trump Show"" went in the can) was NEARLY WON by the Donald, despite George Floyd, COVID, impeachment and all the other mean and miserable and absurd and wrong and harmful and callous stuff featured in this and other episodes.A computer-simulated world it indeed must be, and - like Jim Carrey in ""The Truman Show"" - I really want to get off now, and go back to real life.But where on Earth is that?? And can that EVER happen now that we've slipped so, so very, very far??",True
10,10,Totally fascinating documentary,renfrew-16560,n/a,15/08/2025,I found myself in complete awe of this documentary And how someone so inept could become the President of United States of America and continue to keep the job even with all the backstabbing and doubledealing that was going on. And was shocked at trumps sheer masterstrokes by having a meeting with Kim Jong-un to deescalate tensions between the two countries. I enjoyed this program so much that I'm hoping Trump gets another term as I want to watch season two,False
11,2,Music,jimlucy-05667,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat is it with background music overpowering dialogue?
Watched 20 minutes and turned off.
Absolutely no need for the LOUD music.
If by 'spoilers' do you mean give anything away then yes. Spoiler Alert. Too much. Too LOUD background music.",True
12,10,One of the best documentaries I've seen...,michelle_michael_georgio,n/a,15/08/2025,"...in terms of filming. It was clear, easy to understand, and fascinating. It was also biased, one sided and unfair. I'm British, and have no interest in US politics. But I'm also intelligent and educated. This documentary was filmed with the intent to tell only one story - which is typical. What they could have done, was also shown they good things he did. They could have mentioned how for once, America wasn't actively at war. They could have mentioned, when they made him out to be a lunatic for meeting with Kim Jong Un, that he succeeded in taking steps to secure a good relationship with North Korea. Many other things could have been focused on. But no. Only the bad. And he did have bad, obviously. But so will Biden. And I expect a documentary about him too.",False
13,9,Brilliant television,Garajonay,n/a,15/08/2025,"Feared a biased BBC narrative but it turns out to be a brilliant piece of television. The chronological story of the four year term, good,bad and often very ugly told by people who were close to it all.",False
14,1,A partisan look at trump from the eyes of people who he fired or resigned.,skitofit,n/a,15/08/2025,"It took me about 40 minutes to realize that all the interviewees were people who resigned, where fired, or were wronged by trump or the administration. The TV series drops right after the 2020 election, but not after an official recount of the 2020 ballots. The series' first episode focuses exclusively on trumps ego, his inexperience, and his minimalistic controversies, all from the perspective of people who have nothing good to say, This is not an accurate or a new representation. The series speaks about Russian collusion, but mentions nothing about how the FBI found nothing after such a long and thorough investigation, how much money the investigation cost tax payers, or how much time was wasted by the FBI.50 minutes into the first episode the writer and director of the series paint's trumps meeting with Kim Jong un, as a inexperienced and a bad move... nothing positive about the meeting was said at all; regardless of how the meeting could calm decades of tension between the two countries.The second episode started with 30 minutes of stormy Daniels lolAnd this is what you can expect from this series.Conclusion:
Shows and documentaries like this are a dime a dozen. Nothing new said. Nothing new learned, no new information, just the same tired diatribe you can see, read, or see anywhere, pushed and shoved down the throat since 2016 lol.",False
15,1,Why botha?,jaimenanci,n/a,15/08/2025,Save your brain cells and watch something worth your energy. Why would anyone want to watch this humanpig hybrid do anything ever again is anyone's guess. Why spend money making a show about this gross tango amoeba when you could use that money to make something that will actually benefit mankind. Instead of wasting it on this piece of trash why not sponsor some orangutans or make a documentary about fracking and what it actually costs the planet. - sticking needles in your eyes is more appealing than looking at that bloated geebag one more time.,False
16,1,"TOTALLY BIASED, ONE SIDED DIATRIBE.",stephenharriman,n/a,15/08/2025,"From accounts of failed politicians who were sacked from his administration, to media sources who clearly despise him - this programme is totally biased and does not cover Trump at all fairly. (Typical of the BBC). If you're a democrat/ Biden supporter this programme has been tailored for you.",False
17,1,Fake news,ArnoldThal,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA disgusting ""documentary"" full of alledged actions.

18,n/a,a revision,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw it as a very helpful series . Giving the clues to viewer to build his opinion about a too eccentric president.Not revelations.Only a sort of revision.You understand why he was the chosen of Republicans and electors and people , so different people.You see, step by step, the balls of his presidency, white or black,
And you real discover the roots of the end of his presidency. And why the year 2024 can be , for a part of Americans ( only Americans ? ) so expected.",False

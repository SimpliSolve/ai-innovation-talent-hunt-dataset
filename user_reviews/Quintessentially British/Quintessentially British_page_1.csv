1,5,Quintessentially London,deedee0,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc had the potential to be 10 stars. Unfortunately, the film didn't stick to the title. There was no history, no visiting cities outside England, ridiculous interviewees, and too much political preaching. A drag queen at Chelsea? A clueless young man wearing a silly English flag coat? Actors as expert commentators? No explanation or discussion of British Tea except that it came from China? No mention of Rugby? No discussion of English comedy?The doc shined with the hat, coat, suit, shoe, and umbrella stores that have been in existence for generations. Watching the tradesmen creating the products was amazing.There were subtitle hints at political leanings early but the last 30-40 min was almost unbearable. We get it. The film creators were made up of anti-Brexit supporters and non-straight men. This is when the doc felt VERY American - Too much underlying preaching, liberal judging, and pushing the ideal that everyone white is a racist.This was a very Posh Liberal Londoner perspective.",False
2,1,Stereotypical portrayal of English high society,levelpar,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is nothing 'British' about this documentary at all. It does not reflect modern British life and what the average English, Welsh and Scottish person thinks about being part of the union of nations we call Britain. This is simply another collection of mostly privileged people from southern England who give their take on what makes that island so special. From hereditary peers in the House of Lords to the owner of one of Englands finest shoemakers, this ticks all the boxes to have the average American think we are an island of prudes. I heard the words 'English' and 'England' as much as I did Britain. With no interviews and footage in either Wales and Scotland, and only a 30 second glimpse of the Pennines in N England this can hardly be described as a British documentary. Boat clubs, St George's crosses and English castles/palaces - it truly serves to help cement our reputation as a nation of toffs. Every viewer should understand that todays Britain is vastly different from the one shown in this documentary, starting with the fact that we don't all live in south east England.",False
3,1,Wrong title...should be English,Runrig,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not sure the reason for this documentary. Though it isn't really a documentary it's more of a love letter to the English, particularly the upper class English. Not a single mention of the rest of the British Isles. Scotland? Wales? Hello?This sadly plays to the stereotype that most people outside of Britain think, that everyone is effectively Hugh Grant from Four Weddings and a Funeral. The London cab drivers feels a nod to the common person and comes over forced and painful to watch.Too much focus in London, and ironically, a London that most British people will never get near let alone feel it represents them.Could have been so much better.",False
4,2,Boring,charming_movielover,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have never watched a documentary about England or Britain that bored me this much before. I've watched ones that didn't cover topics I was interested in, but I had never before watched one that covered topics I liked and made me bored until this one.People talked about things more than they showcased them in the documentary. They could have done more voiceovers and still showed the events or places. But instead it was mostly inside with people sitting down and talking.And there were too many shots of cars. Show me the English countryside. Show me London. Show me Scotland. Or Wales. Why am I looking at the inside of a small room at a person in a chair?",False
5,2,"Snooze-Fest - Deeply, Profoundly BORING - Eliteist, Class Conscious Snobbery",cmwhalen2001-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was two hours of my life, that I will never get back! I kept hanging on until the very end HOPING it would pick up a head of steam and eventually offer SOME semblance of interesting interviews, but it just slogs along - with every segment even MORE boring than the previous segment.I am American but have a life long affection for UK/British culture. I am a devout ""Anglophile"" and love the Brits! I grew up in the early 1960's at the height of ""Mersey Beat Music"" and Beatle-mania, the Mods and the Rockers. I love love love British art house cinema and and am a devout fan of Masterpiece Theatre - I watch a LOT of British tv shows and British news media on You Tube to keep informed about the current UK situation.Unfortunately, this is a turgid, slow moving, deeply boring
""Snooze-Fest"". Lots of stuffy, long winded ""Talking Heads"" which are overtly white, male Ruling Class, socially elite FUDDY DUDDY archaic, antiquated, fossilized ""Turnip Toffs"" - the UK Ruling Class 1% who live in massive mansions on huge estates and NEVER WORK but just live off the income their get from rent paying tenants.UK is in reality, multi-cultural with all sorts of folks. 1950 era beliefs in this deeply, profoundly BORING Snooze-Fest. There is waaaay way too much screen time wasted on blathering and banging on about how fabulous Cambridge and cricket is. Yes, of course - Cambridge is a world class university BUT also for ONLY the very rich, white Ruling Class elite. Cricket is a great sport BUT it does not DEFINE the UK/British culture.There are a few snippets of Dame Judy Dench and Ian McKlellann but neither of them really say much of anything of importance....just some random comments of no consequence.SKIP IT - DON'T STREAM IT....... Even watching ""Palace Confidential"" on You Tube every Thursday when a brand new episode drops - offers far more insight to the UK and what is happening in England today.I don't really believe in the concept of monarchy and inheirited wealth with artistocratic titles BUT I greatly admired and respected Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and King Charles III will be a good solid ""Transition Monarch"" until William and Kate take over the monarchy.",False
6,2,Really?,considerthebirds,n/a,16/08/2025,"If this were given a new title it might be quite entertaining, but it really isn't.The worst part is that British and English are being used as synonymous, what of the voices that are Welsh, Scots, Northern Irish? Or even from parts of England that aren't in the southern east area of England, focusing on London, Blenheim palace, and Cambridge.The title could be archetypal English, as if we all go to Oxbridge, Saville Row for clothing, only watch Shakespeare and play cricket. I'm afraid it was a bit laughable. Anyone wanting to see any sort of insight into the country are going to be disappointed. The interviewees are mildly entertaining, but frankly it could have been so much better.",False
7,1,Don't believe what you watch,mbell-56214,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to hear the opinions of theatre lovies and some very rich people, then this might be the film for you. But it bears no reality to real life in Britain. Apart from two London taxi drivers it talks to no working class or middle class people. The film also strays no further than London and the affluent south. This is probably one of the worse documentaries I have ever seen. It's not funny, it's not clever, and in no way whatsoever it's not a reality.What an abysmal waist of time. What it if you wish but please do not think this is what Britain if like. As a brit I can only apologise for this nonsense.",False

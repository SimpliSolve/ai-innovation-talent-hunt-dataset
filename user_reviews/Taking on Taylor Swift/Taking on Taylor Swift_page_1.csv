1,2,They had sold their rights,ksschwei-62555,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary explores the copyright lawsuit surrounding the song Shake it Off, the highly popular and successful, Diamond certified single by Taylor Swift. The ""writers"" Hall and Butler claimed that Swift stole their lyrics and progression. This documentary fails to dive deep into the actual legality of the lawsuit or with actual court documentation, or legal filings.The problem is that the writers Hall and Butler sold their rights years ago, and thus did not hold legal claim to the song any longer and failed to inform the courts. The owners who purchased the song from Hall and Butler sided with Swift. Once it was revealed to the courts that Hall and Butler had sold their rights, the lawsuit dissolved rapidly. Even another artist used the exact phrase and progression and performed their top 10 hit at an awards show prior to Shake it Off even being written and they did not sue that artist.The lesson here that should have been discussed is the importance of maintaining your publishing rights. In this case, Hall and Butler sold their rights but still wanted to get paid for something they no longer owned. It would have made a more interesting documentary had they actually dealt with the importance of copyright and publishing rights, instead they failed to explain this critical hole in their case. Failure to explore the lack of publishing rights, the foundation of copyright lawsuits, seemed to reveal a potential biased narrative being pushed by the production company. Its unclear why they failed to include this detail of critical importance not only to this case, but to all cases. You must actually own the rights.",False
2,1,Ridiculous,bjp249249,n/a,16/08/2025,Absolutely ridiculous to think this has any resemblance to Taylor Swift song. There are about 4 of the same words. I can name you thousands of songs that have four of the same words in them. This is merely a few people trying to ride Taylor Swift coattails. Never heard of a single song these guys wrote or the group he wrote them for. Players gonna play has been a saying since I was in high school. Sean hall is just jealous of Taylor Swift's talent and success. Taylor Swift has written over 200 songs and has 12 Grammys. What does Sean hall have? Nothing. What can I say haters gonna hate. You're gonna sue me now?,False
3,1,Name dropping for views is what they did here,cayybezz,n/a,16/08/2025,"The name ""Taylor Swift"" is so clickable, especially right now. The HATERS click on it because it says ""taking on"" and the SWIFTIES click because they love her and want to watch any content involving her. This was 40+ minutes of whining and throwing out accusations that actually make no sense. Throwing stuff at a wall and hoping it sticks, if you will. Don't waste your time or brain cells! She's not a thief, she always gives credit where it's due. She has proven that time and time again. They mention the lawsuit being a money grab and that's absolutely what it looks like. They also used this documentary as an outlet to bring up cultural appropriation, and in my opinion, that's reaching. It has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that she used a common phrase, used everywhere, that wasn't trademarked in any way, in a song that is meant to dismiss ""critics"" that belittle her and all of her achievements.",False
4,1,Complete garbage.,sqwsmds,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a complete joke. I was baffled at these dudes thinking that they have any writing credits to this song. Just trying to ride off of Taylor's fame, and make money off of someone else's hard work. If this song wasn't poplar they wouldn't even care, but because it's Taylor Swift.... Taylor doesn't need to steal song lyrics, she's one of the best lyricist out there. The lyrics they are accusing her of stealing are common phrases. Just 2 guys trying to ride off of Taylor's success, and trying to get media coverage, that I hope backfired on them. Very disappointed in HBO for even airing this garbage. Please don't waste any time watching this joke of a documentary.",False
5,1,Exploiting her Fame,julianarestivo,n/a,16/08/2025,Why is Taylor in the poster for this from the Reputation Era? What does reputation have to do with Shake it Off? Why are the other artists not on the poster? Because they know swifties will click when they see her. They couldn't get the money from the lawsuit so they thought to make a documentary about it. This is absolutely ridiculous. Taylor has a history of often over crediting her work not under-crediting it. Go make music instead of using her to make money. Pathetic. I can see why Netflix and Disney+ don't have this on their platform because they already have docs from Taylor that will actually make money. Not this garbage. I guess anyone will try to make money off her fame.,False
6,7,The arrogant Swifties in full force here,mwillyk-00336,n/a,16/08/2025,"You know, just because these two songwriters supposedly ""sold"" the rights to the song, that doesn't mean that Swift didn't steal the ""riff"" and there isn't anything wrong with that. Swift's songs all seemed to be based on the same one or two chords and they battle each other to sound ""different."" it shouldn't be any surprise that something that goes beyond that she would ""borrow"" from someone else's song. The arrogant Swift is one of the most overrated songwriters and musicians out there, and she is well known to have an ""army"" of co-writers to turn what she and her fans think are ""cool"" nonsense phrasings into coherent lyrics fit for the self-obsessed MeToo crowd. I remember when Jimmy Kimmel had her on his show when he asked her to explain some of her lyrics, and she was too narcissistic to realize that he was poking fun at them. This is contemporary music for you: someone who would be lost in shuffle in the 70s and 80s with this kind of crap is considered a ""star"" because she exists in an ""era"" of crap ""music."" I mean, what else are critics going to say relative to what passes for ""pop"" music today? And why is Swift really such a ""success"" today? Because unlike her country music contemporaries, she completely abandoned the country audience, prancing around on stage in baton-twirler outfits so that her ""fans"" can ogle her.",False
7,1,A swing and a miss!,luke-66371,n/a,16/08/2025,"Definitely don't recommend this documentary. Basically a bunch of clout chasers claiming this was ""cultural appropriation"". Claiming that the sayings came from the hood. Not sure how this has anything to do with copyright. These are common phrases all around. The fact they didn't even own the rights anymore just adds to the stupidity. People just trying to get unwarranted payouts based on someone else's talent. This documentary in its self is solely trying to use taylor swifts name to gain traction. Especially with the massive traction Taylor Swift has right now.If I could rate lower I would!",False
8,7,Music industry full of sharks,MickyG333,n/a,16/08/2025,"7.3 stars.That's the stuff. This documentary is very short like 42 minutes. It just became available for me on Max network, and I saw Taylor Swift in the title and I love Taylor Swift; so I had to watch.I am an aging male with little to no life outside of teleworking a government job, watching lots of films, lots social media viewing, reading books and history stuff etc. But I still love Swift. I've liked her music since the first time I heard her stuff about 17 years ago (I guess she's been around for about 20 years?).She has come up on top, when you sift the gold out of the pile of dirt, that gold is Taylor. She is and always will be one of the greats, and when she commits some sort of infringement of lyrical originality, she would probably admit it. In this case, she did in fact write something in her lyrics that had already been written and actually made a lot of money for the artists 15 years prior. But Taylor would not admit that she copied it. I believe her, I think she probably didn't copy it, it was merely a coincidence, however the fact remains that she re-used lyrics that belonged to another artist. Whether she was aware of those lyrics or copied them, is irrelevant to me. I think she owed them $$ and I bet she paid them, even though we may never find out until someone squeals.",False
9,1,Further proof of an utterly ridiculous claim,DJRMewzique,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary takes a look at Sean Hall and Nathan Butler's ridiculous claim that Swift plagiarized their song, simply by her use of two extremely commonly used phrases in a similar manner to a song they wrote....using the idiotic (non)concept of ""cultural appropriation"" as a big basis for their claim.*I* used those phrases before Swift released her hit....and I was an almost-40 white at the time.Yep, this just helped make their claim even more imbecilic. This documentary trying to give their claim even an ounce of weight was truly just....hilarious.This was a 100% cash grab by Hall and Butler with absolutely zero legal, or logical, basis. Even suggesting it is anything but is completely idiotic.",False
10,1,CNN trash,colonel-13070,n/a,16/08/2025,"More CNN trash. Leave it up to CNN to give this guy so much time and effort to create this documentary. The guy had no legal right to a song after he sold his rights away. Once that was discovered, the whole thing collapsed anyway. Leave it up to CNN to try to trash someone who is at the top of her game. I guess being a rich white girls enough for them to attack her on. No mention of how immensely and incredibly talented. She is along with being extremely intelligent in her field.... And I'm not really a fan. Simply because of the genre she's in. But I do acknowledge her story 1000%. I'm seeing a pattern in the CNN documentaries where they are very slanted. I was hoping for better. As well all things CNN they have failed again. Bring back the 1990 version of CNN and we will all be much happier.",False
11,1,Not worth watching,juanrodcruz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is this what tabloids do nowadays? Because this sure isn't a documentary.I started watching this because I normally don't follow news and just focus on the artist and most of the content I've been finding on other controversies of hers has been acceptable for my standards. It's clear from the get go where they're going to go with this and I only finished watching it because I've been a huge fan of hers since the beginning and was thinking I may biased and it's always important to hear both parts. However I do feel this may be more biased than I am.PD: One thing is certain though, they didn't get any settlement and this is their way to pay for their lawyer because they didn't need to use an image of only her and her name in big letters as a cover.",False
12,1,No merit...,screamagain17,n/a,16/08/2025,Whatsoever. Every past example they brought forth to try and piggy back off of dealt with melody and not specifically the lyrical argument that was presented during every 5 minutes of the doc. THAT argument I can understand completely and might have been agreeable with. This is just another gross and calculated strategy to profit and garner recognition off of the name of a successful and high profile individual at a time when they are doing exceptionally well in their career. CNN clearly didn't care to thoroughly read through the court documents that they displayed excerpts from multiple times on screen. Shame. Highly disappointed that this was produced and published.,False
13,1,"Ridiculous so called ""documentary""",khopeemlove,n/a,16/08/2025,"I tried to watch and appreciate this show, but it was pretty terrible. I think there is plenty to be said about respecting black culture, and not piggy backing/using other artist's work, in whole or part. However, just as the court ruled, this was not the situation to make the case for that argument. I think the creators used Taylor Swift's name and star power to gain a larger audience's attention. However, this clearly backfired because the program wasn't even about her, and that's obvious in the first 15
minutes. The title insinuates wrong-doing on Taylor's part, but they provide no proof of that during the program. She ended up presiding in the case, which is not revealed, so what validity does this program have at all??? I wish I could get the hour I spent watching it back. Complete waste of my time.Given that the writers already sold their rights to the music makes their lawsuit and attempt at gaining sympathy in the program nothing short of pitiful.",False
14,1,Clickbait and meaningless,GreenEyed312,n/a,16/08/2025,"Who honestly approved this? Oh right.... CNN.No wonder your network has become hot garbage. I used to enjoy CNN documentaries til now. The Max platform should be ashamed to stream this junk. This dude is plain salty. Playas gon play? I mean get real. Anyone could have said that. Doesn't mean they are after you. When things don't go your way, what do we do? Play the victim. Whine whine whine. Taylor's song did not sound like yours. She didn't steal your line. You might as well come after me, I've used that like as well. Get over yourself. Sounds like you are the hater. There is a reason why Taylor Swift has been an icon in these decades. I only recognize 2 of your songs. LOL. COPE HARDER.",False

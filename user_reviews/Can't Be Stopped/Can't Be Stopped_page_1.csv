Hollywood's Can't Be Stopped crew is one of the most influential and recognizable graffiti crews of all time and this movie tells both the history of the art itself and how this group has contributed to it.As their Skate works to create a surrogate family that can protect these artists from the streets, they all learn lessons in integrity, morality and respect. Unbeknownst to these young artists, the tagging that they were doing was a pioneering force and would shape the art world for the future.Directed by Cody Smith over a ten-year period, this features 2Mex, Marc 7, alchemist, Brandon 2 Tone, Anger, Ares, Atlas, Aura, Awol One, Mickey Avalon, Beri, Baba, Bleek, Blosom, Chaz Bojorquez.

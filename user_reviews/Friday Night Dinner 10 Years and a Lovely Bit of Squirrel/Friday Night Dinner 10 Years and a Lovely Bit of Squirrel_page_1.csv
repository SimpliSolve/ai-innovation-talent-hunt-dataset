1,8,Great!,CinemaLover2008,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile it doesn't go as in depth as you would want/expect,it still does a great job of re-caping the last 10 years and talking about it plus how it was made! Obviously i have to talk about the sad passing of Paul Ritter(Martin) and while he is in this documentary it's not for that long,for obvious reasons,and it broke my heart to see him the way he looked in this documentary and he will forever be in our hearts! Shalom Paul Ritter and Friday Night Dinner.",True

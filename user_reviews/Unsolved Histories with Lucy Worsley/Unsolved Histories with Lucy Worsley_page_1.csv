1,7,Good documentary,bbewnylorac,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lucy Worsley is a talented host. Her worst trait is looking like she's smiling when she isn't. I.e. While talking about deaths during the plague. But generally this is a good series. It's not as silly as others she's done. Someone has stopped her from dressing up in period costume, which is a good thing. I watched the episode about the 14th century plague, which was really interesting. Worsley took us to a village and focused on a family - not easy when records are rare and complicated. And Worley is genuinely passionate about history. She also is good at presenting dry and complex information in an entertaining way. She'll take you to a medieval hostel and ask you to imagine sleeping in a room, on straw, with 50 people, while on a pilgrimage to Canterbury. So if you're into history, this show is good.",False
2,8,"Always interesting and thought provoking, whether you agree or not.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Renowned British historian takes a look at several of Britain's most infamous stories, The Princes in the Tower, Guy Fawkes, The Witch trials and more.I'm a big fan of Lucy Worsley, and her presenting style, she has a warm and engaging personality, but she brings a degree of intelligence, and looks at things from a different perspective, often going beyond the direct subject matter, investigating the outskirts.If there was one criticism I could make, it's that she sometimes looks at history through modern day eyes, and sometimes it does detract, visible in the Queen Mary episode.The best for me so far, Guy Fawkes, that was incredible, she totally transformed how I look at him and the event, it's a fascinating watch.These are beautifully produced documentaries, they are slick and beautifully edited. Get used to seeing Lucy walking into buildings, you'll see a lot of that.Hopefully more will follow, personally I'd love to see her investigate Churchill and Nelson.8/10.",False
3,8,Entertaining history!,billsoccer,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerYou'll hear about princes locked up in the Tower of London who disappear, details of a Kings madness long suppressed, the actual disease that the Black Death is blamed on, and, the predecessor to the Salem witch trials. As an American, most of the details were new to me, and fascinating.If you're new to Lucy, you'll notice a lisp or similar speech defect. Don't be put off - she has a wealth of knowledge about these affairs the should be able to educate an educated Englishman.Let me give you an example. Did you know there are 3 types of the bacteria that causes plague - Bubonic being one of them? Further, it seems like it was 1 of the other 2 strains which did most of the killing in the Dark Ages?",True
4,5,Lucy Worsley does not need a BBC SCRIPT!,vixescape,n/a,15/08/2025,"I adore Lucy Worsley as she is a brilliant, very smart historian. One of Britain's best IMHO. So why do the BBC insist she works from one of their scripts which are very poorly written, inaccurate & quite boring?At the start of each episode Lucy introduces the subject & says ""This is part of British MYTHOLGY!"" This single line defeats the entire object of her series, so why does the BBC insist she says it? Lucy is investigating catastrophic & history changing events, but telling the viewers at the start, that they are simply all ""myths"" is really unhelpful. The Black Death was not a myth & neither was the mystery of the poor Princes in the Tower. Was World War's 1 & 2 myths as well? Perhaps the abdication of Edward the VIII was a myth too. Do you see how silly this is?I realise the BBC, by mythologising British history, erases the importance of these events & the BBC has a collectivist reason for doing it. But if the BBC must script & mythologise a British history series, why use the brilliant talents of one of our best lady historians? Any presenter can read a collectivist script written by the BBC, so why insult Lucy by doing this. Sorry, but it does not make sense.5 stars for Lucy!! X.",False

1,6,What truth?,kskmah,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a pretty good documentary about the Dyatlov Pass, but it doesn't reveal anything that hasn't been talked about already. There is no truth because the case still remains a mystery. I thought it would reveal what actually happened but nope.",True
2,6,STILL UNSOLVED,kate-dunlop-383-312884,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you've never seen a docu on this subject, I'd say this was a good starting point but don't be fooled, the Docu maker definitely alludes to finally revealing the truth behind the D. P. incident. But he doesn't. It's still unsolved to this day (Oct 2021). Be warned though: constant use of the death pics of the souls that died Re a little jarring. If you like a good picture of a frozen dead body though, this is for you.",True
3,7,Interesting & fresh,Sykes64,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI think for those who suggest this is poor because it offers no new insights or even, no answers to this long standing mystery, then they must be quite naive. It doesn't pretend to have all the answers & as for fresh ideas, I think it does have something new to offer despite what others have said. It's tastefully done. It provides the basic facts as well as background behind the students & some of the Soviet history that may or may not have played a role in the outcome of this group. It doesn't have the answers but it does provide additional insight with a little bit of history. It's interesting & delicately handled.",True
4,n/a,It's more about the author than the truth,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe entertaining to some, boring to others, but in either case not the least revealing. And before you start suspecting innocent people, you should have done better research.",False
5,6,"What happened to nine Russian hikers on Dyatlov Pass in early February, 1959?",Wuchakk,n/a,16/08/2025,"British-American documentarian Liam Le Guillou travels to the area in question in the northeast Ural Mountains to talk to the locals and examine the best theories as to why the nine athletic Russians (seven men and two women) left their tents in the freezing cold of the night without adequate attire, with most perishing of hypothermia far away and a few others revealing signs of blunt force trauma.""An Unknown Compelling Force"" (2021) is worthwhile for learning about the nine victims, as well as the inaccessible region in general. Yekaterinburg is the closest city, which is 340 miles to the south; and the closest town like 60 miles away. Seven of the nine hikers were college students with the other man a healthy veteran of WW2, fifteen years their senior. They left behind undeveloped film and diaries up until the day of their deaths for evidence of what went down, not to mention their grisly remains and the autopsies thereof.While Le Guillou wisely leaves the mystery open at the end, he also doesn't fail to point out what he thinks likely went down with the help of various experts and investigators, Russian and American. Certain popular theories, including the outlandish ones, are ruled out for one good reason or another, which leaves the most obvious scenario, according to Liam and his experts. Simply put, they believe the hikers were murdered, possibly by a savage band of Khanty living in the area, who wouldn't take kindly to Soviet invaders, especially if they inadvertently marred one of their shrines.While this theory is interesting, there wasn't any evidence at the scene of these supposed assailants, like footprints. The better theory is that 3 feet of shifting snow during the snowstorm suddenly fell on the tent at night, which panicked the nine inhabitants. Fearful of an actual avalanche, they cut themselves out of the tent and fled without proper attire. When they realized an avalanche wasn't going to happen, some tried to make it back to the tent but died of hypothermia in the -13 degrees Fahrenheit weather (it was no doubt difficult to find the camp in those conditions). What happened to the others is well explained in an 11-minute documentary called ""Is Dyatlov Pass Mystery Finally Solved,"" available for free on Youtube.This film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes.GRADE: B-",False
6,10,The best documentary currently available on the Dyatlov pass incident by far.,shane95,n/a,16/08/2025,"It goes without saying that it's clear a lot of work went into this film. It's easy to tell director Liam Le Guillou's soul was very much in this project and you can tell it's a mystery he is clearly very passionate about understanding.The film boasts stunning cinematography, great commentary from Guillou himself and some interesting interviews with individuals who were around at the time of the incident and modern specialists who can shine a new light on what may have happened. It should also be noted a lot of care for the victim's is present by all involved throughout the film.At its core the Dyatlov Pass Incident is a story of loss and tragedy, something the film makes clear. Although 1959 may seem long ago, it's quite possible members of the team would still be alive today if they had returned safely from their expedition, reminding us this is a modern mystery.The possibilities put forward in the film are believable and make sure to not go too far past the point of sounding far fetched. In the end the cause of the students deaths that is settled upon as most credible and quite possible has a lot to back it up. The findings are definitely strong.An excellent documentary that deserves plenty of praise. The world may never get full answers on what happened to those smart, adventurous young students that cold night in the Russian Urals, but this documentary does it's very best to give us as an answer.In a mystery where aliens, yetis, secret soviet psychological weapons and other extreme possibilities have been put forward over the years, 'An Unknown Compelling Force' keeps it's head on straight and delves into the most likely causes, not the most far fetched which is highly refreshing.",False
7,3,Does not do what it says on the tin,emilygrace1991,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary, although an interesting case does not ""reveal the truth"". SPOILER no one knows what happened. The documentary maker is a huge fan of himself, and that is very clear throughout. I did however find the conspiracy theories interesting to learn about, and without giving away my own thoughts, I do feel that the host suggests that all conspiracies hold weight when some are simply laughable. I would not recommend this documentary if you want facts with any weight to them. Much better off doing your own research or simply listening to a podcast. Dont advertise to reveal everything, when in fact there is nothing to reveal.",True
8,9,"Well-researched and laid out, good pacing",jeffreytengrotenhuis,n/a,16/08/2025,It's well-produced for a smaller documentary. I found the narration honest and straightforward. The music was pleasant. The assertions were measured and factual. And the tension was well-built.,False
9,4,Good For New Comers,chad-61313,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're new to the story, this doc is a good watch to a degree. Like someone else mentioned, the author seems a bit pretentious and it takes away from the real story. However, if you're familiar with the case, there's absolutely nothing new here. So, the trailer is misleading and makes you think some new truth to the case has been revealed, but no.This is a tragic story and it's sad to believe no one will never truly know what happened to the team. There are too many questions still unanswered. The rest of this doc revolves around the author himself and the trip to Russia, which in retrospect, was an absolute waste of time and energy.",False
10,9,Definitely the best documentary on the Dyatlov Pass,AndyR_1279,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this movie - it was a great blend of investigation and adventure.There's so much information out there on the subject, but I think this film does the best job to look at all the information and sort through it in a way that makes sense.Sure if you're already an ""expert"" on the subject you might know a lot of this stuff, but I still think you'll get a lot from it.I learned more about who the hikers were than in any of the other online videos and I really enjoyed seeing what the location was actually like, was awesome! I think this film is onto something in terms of the theory.. but I like how it leaves something for us to think about...
A must watch for mystery and true crime fans!!",False
11,10,Fantastic Documentary on a compelling mystery,simon-mccormack-65364,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have been fascinated with the Dyatlov pass incident for many years now. I have watched various documentaries or films on the tragedy, but I don't remember them to be as in depth as this one.I really enjoyed this detailed account of the incident. Some great interviews and photos to help analyse all the evidence. I did learn a lot of new facts in regards to the case. These facts may be available on websites and such, but its great that they are put together in this way, to allow us to draw our own conclusions on what actually could have happened.The only slight disappointment, is the theory that they suggest towards the end, (although it is probably the most likely scenario that took place) it's still not definitive on what happened, but without new evidence, I don't think it ever will be.I hope people give this a try, this documentary is head and shoulders above Netflix docs which drag stuff out over 6 episodes when it could have been done in just 1.My rating is 10/10.",True
12,8,Probably the best D.P.I. account so far,portal1790,n/a,16/08/2025,A Worthwhile account of the Dyatlov Pass Incident mystery in a very good foto documentary about what's really happened that night . The evidence it's here. A remarkable true story very well told.,False
13,9,Chilling!,adamhardman13,n/a,16/08/2025,Chilling and thought provoking doc about the unsolved deaths of a group of young Soviets. Must watch for fans of unsolved mysteries.,False
14,8,One of the best documentaries I've seen,chi_town_fed,n/a,16/08/2025,"People who track this incident over the years may not be as impressed as I am with this documentary. I truly enjoyed the balanced approach and how logic was used to rule out wild speculation. I agree with the ""speculative"" conclusion eluded to toward the end of the documentary. Based on the information presented, I have a logical explanation regarding what some may view as remaining unanswered questions. Imagine you decide to force people to freeze to death and notice someone managed to build a fire. You would likely think plan ""A"" isn't working out as intended. Therefore, you go to their location and finish any survivors off. Again, this is my own speculation.",False
15,10,The Only DYATLOV Documentary That Reveals The Russian Cover Up Of Lies!,silicontourist,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anyone new to this story need only see this one documentary. Its extremely in depth about the mysterious events (that occurred on February 1st or 2nd in 1959) and the disgusting way that the Russian authorities (i.e. The Government) misled the families and the public with lies and a cover ups.I have known of this incident for a good many years and though the documentary is quite thorough, it is also misleading in what it advertises itself as having done. They say that they discovered the truth as to what happened to the 9 hikers and, the horrific conditions in which they were all found but, this is not true. How they died is still unknown and unproved. There conclusion was/is just a theory but, it is based upon the recent findings of a Russian criminal pathologist; due to the fact that the files were released to the public after the fall of the Russian dictatorship.For myself it is good to know that an Eastern pathologist from Russia and, another from the West, came to the same decision 60 years after the incident. I, after discovering the story, 20 plus years ago reached the same conclusion as, at the time researching what I could, I found that it was plain as day!Governments in the West do the same lies and cover ups that communist dictatorships and many oppressed peoples countries have done forever!",False
16,9,Absorbing investigation into a tragic mystery,Milk_Tray_Guy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fascinating documentary film about the facts (as far as they are known) and theories surrounding the notorious Dyatlov Pass incident (the unexplained violent deaths of a nine-strong Russian hiking team - all students - in the remote Ural mountains in 1959). It includes detailed assessments by modern-day forensic and medical experts (both Russian and American) of the incident scene, the statements and case notes of the original investigators, the hikers own diaries and notebooks written during their trip, the developed film from the hikers own cameras, and the original autopsy findings/photographs. We'll probably never know the cause of their bizarre behaviour on their final night and their horrendous deaths soon afterwards - but whatever happened was clearly catastrophic. 9/10.",False

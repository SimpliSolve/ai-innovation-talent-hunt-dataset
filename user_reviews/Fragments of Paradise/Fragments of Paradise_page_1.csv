1,9,Beautiful and sentimental,enakaite,n/a,15/08/2025,"As someone who didn't really knew who Jonas Mekas was i found this documentary really inspiring and raw. There are a different footage used though out this film that makes you connect with him not only as talented person but as human, as a father, husband, a kid who ran from war, a silly kid in old man's body.After watching this movie i felt inspired and also cried, because it is that beautiful.As a fellow Lithuanian i'm proud.But if you know something about Jonas Mekas, this film won't reveal much new information, maybe some facts. It's important to understand time frame and situation world was facing at that time.",False

1,7,Portrait of the artist as a young man,paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Eric Ravilious's paintings have a particularly English quality; but while they celebrate the English landscape, they in no way romaticise it. He later became a naval war artist, and died in Iceland while painting the fight against Hitler. This documentary, filled with many examples of his art, casts him as a boyish innocent, a man filled with simple excitement at the joys in his life, very much including his craft, albeit one who asked a lot of his (also talented) wife. If you like what you see in this film, the Fry Art Gallery in Saffron Walden is a great place to see his work (and that of the other Great Bardfield artists).",False
2,4,Lovely Film 8/10 with one horrendous flaw 0/10,bryan-16440,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhy on earth did the production team find it necessary to show the final moments of HMS Barham when it's ammunition magazines blew up after being hit by 3 torpedoes leading to it being sunk off the Egyptian coast November 1941 by the German submarine U-331 with the loss of 862 crewmen, approximately two thirds of her crew. Some of which can be seen on the stricken ship as it listed to port just before the explosion.Thus had no bearing whatsoever to the artist nor his work.I am appalled.",True

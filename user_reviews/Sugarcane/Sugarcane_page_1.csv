1,8,"Incredibly sad and tough to watch, but you SHOULD see this film.",planktonrules,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Sugarcane"" is a documentary you should see. However, I am warning you up front...it's incredibly depressing because it's true. All the murders and sexual abuse did happen...and if you've been a victim yourself, you might want to think twice before you see it.The film follows several people as they try to get to the truth about the Indian residential schools in Canada. This is because they not only abused the kids to knock away their culture, by the Catholic priests who ran the places often molested these kids. And, to make it worse, when the girls got pregnant, they babies were literally tossed into incinerators at least in the case of St. Joseph's Mission.The only reason I gave this must-see film an 8 is that technically it was far from perfect...but still is most watchable. Occasionally the camerawork was poor and I feel that SOME parts should have been trimmed to make the story more succinct. Still, these are minor concerns and it's a film that NEEDS to be seen.By the way, if you are wondering if these schools for the natives are unique, unfortunately they are not. The first huge sexual abuse scandal that was uncovered at a Catholic residential school was one for deaf kids! It's in the exceptional documentary ""Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God"".",False
2,8,quiet desperation,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Whether the phrase 'systemic abuse' applies here is hardly worth discussing. The facts are that physical abuse, verbal abuse, cultural abuse, and sexual abuse occurred regularly over many years in the Catholic-run residential schools for indigenous children, both in the United States and Canada. Indigenous filmmaker Julian Brave NoiseCat has teamed with experienced documentarian Emily Kassie to bring this story to light.This National Geographic documentary mostly narrows its focus to St Joseph Mission near Williams Lake, British Columbia. The school closed in 1981, but it was originally one of many secretive and segregated residential schools opened to deal with ""the Indian problem"" in Canada. We are informed there were 139 schools in Canada and 408 in the U. S. What we notice from the start is that the film is deliberately paced to emphasize the lives of quiet desperation so many have led.In 2021, a discovery of approximately 200 unmarked graves at a different school led to a dedicated crew going deeper on research, and finding records of reported abuse and cover-ups, as well as additional unmarked graves at St Joseph. It turns out these schools required the students to speak only English, convert to Catholicism, and basically erase their native culture - all while referring to them by numbers, rather than names.Two very personal stories are followed here. One involves co-director Julian as he re-connects with his father Ed Archie NoiseCat. Ed is one of many who never knew the truth of their past and have mostly buried the memories of the mission. With Julian's work, not only do the two create a father-son bond, they also discover a stunning detail for Ed - involving a shoebox and an incinerator. The other personal story here involves former Chief Rick Gilbert, who along with his wife, uncovers a truly shocking connection in his family tree. We also follow Rick to Vatican City where the Pope reads a prepared statement filled with words, but no action.The former students are referred to as ""survivors"", partly because so many didn't. And while we can see and feel the pain and quiet suffering these folks are carrying, we learn that history and those memories continue to take lives. The history of abuse within the Catholic Church is not limited to white kids, it's just the indigenous history hasn't received the same publicity. The suppressed memories and search for roots is so important, and yet so many unanswered questions remain for survivors and descendants. And no one has been held accountable for the atrocities. Infanticide, abuse, cruelty, and humiliation do not seem to fit the journey of these dignified and quietly suffering folks, but there is an uplifting element with Ed and Julian, father and son.In limited theaters beginning August 30, 2024.",False
3,7,Chilling and unsetting,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.""Sugarcane"" is an emotionally, chilling and disturbing documentary that explores the abuse indigenous individuals had experienced in residential schools and explores the horrifying actions from the government with strong discussions from the participants, great sense of direction and deeply personal insights of the situation.Many of the camerawork, sound designs and the conversations from the participants were beautiful, depressing, and emotional as learning about what the people have encountered in these schools is horrifying and upsetting. No individuals should have to suffer should abuse.Despite some of the documentary structure feeling slow, it still remains an important documentary to see.",False
4,6,"Very important subject, not masterfully done",Sybiraczka55,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this film at the Sundance Film Festival this year. The difficult subject of abuse in mission school, unanswered questions and consequences for the abuse victims and their descendants. Despite its noble intentions and the significance of the subject matter, this film falls short of delivering a masterful narrative with some repetitive scenes. The pacing felt uneven, with certain segments dragging on while others lack sufficient depth. Moreover, the editing occasionally undermines the emotional resonance of the testimonies, detracting from their impact. A more refined approach to story telling and presentation could have elevated this documentary to a more impactfull level.",False
5,7,Feel bad for all Indigenous people,hanzosteel83,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel bad for all Indigenous people. In Canada and The United States. They have bad treated as bad if not worse than any other people on the plant. However, this documentary did not help me to understand their experience. It was poorly done in my opinion. It jumped around way to much. And had a lot of wasted scenes. The people in Canada who this documentary was about suffered greatly. No doubt about that. But, their story wasn't told here. They are still investigating things that happened way back into like the thirties. The Catholic Church is really made out to be the devil. And no doubt some were. But, anytime there is a church as large as they are. There will be a percentage of bad. The problem goes way deeper. They were lied to over and over again. They received no justice all around the world. No apology will ever fix all the tragedy they have suffered.",False
6,7,HEARTBREAKING & EYE OPENING...!,masonfisk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nominated this year for Best Documentary feature comes this sobering tale of sexual improprieties inflicted by the Catholic church upon Canadian Indigenous children up until shockingly recently. Taking testimony from survivors of the atrocities, now in their later years, which detail multiple deaths (infants born of rape were disposed of in mass graves or in incinerators) that a small group of investigators try to solve (even though we hear in voice over a mass grave was found) while memories of the past are pried open to reveal past evils. Just as a piece exposing historical sins by the church is enough for someone to tune in & be horrified but as these stories keep emerging (similar feats were performed by the church in Australia & Ireland in fictional accounts like RabbitProof Fence & The Magdalene Sisters) people wonder how far the church has fallen in the minds of most parishoners.",False
7,10,"Compelling, gripping, essential",jqsyxjcfw,n/a,16/08/2025,"This remarkable film was the most memorable one I saw at Sundance this year. It has stayed with me for weeks. The film is beautifully shot and captures the landscape of Williams Lake. The directors artfully weave several narratives into the film. Each participant has a compelling and moving story of their horrific experiences at St. Joseph's mission. Although this was difficult to watch, the filmmakers handled these moments with much sensitivity and compassion. The film is lightened with colorful coverage of ceremonies and celebrations. All the participants, with the exception of the late Rick Gilbert, were at the q and a. Their testimonies were as moving and heart rendering as the film. The film well deserved the extended applause and standing ovation. A vital story that needed to be told. Most importantly, the making of the film was a healing process for the survivors. I cannot overstate how excellent this film. It should be seen by every Canadian and American...",False
8,10,"gripping, chilling, and deeply moving",delancy-87723,n/a,16/08/2025,"This intimate look at a devastating community history was jarring and beautiful. I was moved beyond words, horrified at the actions of the canadian government and catholic church, and my heart aches for the countless people affected by the abuse and trauma. Many stories from the community are interwoven, giving a glimpse into the complex ways residential schools have poisoned generations of people. The resilience and courage of the subjects of this film cannot be understated. This piece felt deeply personal and widely relatable. The emotional toll it took was great and necessary. We are so lucky to hear this story.",False
9,10,Moving film beautifully done,SarahyoungerNYC,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw Sugarcane at its New York City premiere last night. Wow. The storytelling is masterful, the film is so beautifully shot and scored. I am still devastated by what I heard and saw the next day. The filmmakers found moments of levity that made this so watchable. The four primary narratives are interwoven in a very seamless way. What is particularly stirring is the way the co-director decided to share his own story and that of his family. It's hard to believe that any of this really took place in North America over the last century. This film is So powerful and so well done. A must see for anyone who loves film.",False
10,2,Important Subjected Ruined by Too Much B-Roll,Hanson92,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm sorely disappointed in this documentary. I expected more. It lacks substance and has more scenery than stories. For such an important topic this feels disrespectful. We should all learn about how appallingly the indigenous peoples of North America have been and even continue to be treated by the governments, religious institutions, and subsequent people.This movie is a waste of an opportunity to inform us, to tell the true and heartbreaking stories of those deeply harmed. I sincerely hope someone in the field of documentaries someday does justice to this issue, because after an hour I just couldn't watch it any longer.",False
11,9,Heartbreaking,cinephile_13,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary was genuinely heartbreaking. I had heard of the residential schools and their atrocities but never knew the extent of it. Hearing first hand accounts and seeing the lasting impact the schools had on individuals and the generations that followed provided a new perspective on the issue. The only reason I did not give it a 10 was because it felt a little slow at times. Despite the pace the cinematography was stunning and it allowed the viewer time to soak it in and think. Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie wanted to raise awareness and educate others and they succeeded in their goal.,False
12,10,Gripping and Superb,junolie,n/a,16/08/2025,"This outstanding film was well received at the Premiere in Toronto. The audience reaction was overwhelming with a heartfelt standing ovation. This beautifully rendered film depicts the impact of the residential schools on the survivors and their families. The film was balanced between the facts and the personal stories of the participants who spoke movingly about their trauma. There were spots of humour and colour to brighten the mood of the film. The most compelling stories were the reconciliation between Julian and his father and the late Rick Gilbert's sad awakening. Both were told with such grace and intimacy. Truly an amazing documentary, the best that I have seen this year.",False
13,10,Breathtaking and urgent,bmpktydwvq,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is poetry. It is not just important it is cinematic and exceptional filmmaking. The New York Times called it a must-see and it is.The storytelling is a masterpiece of cinema. Stunning cinematography intricate multi character editing and the score is so beautiful and chilling.How can we know who we are if we don't know our origin story or how we got here? Sugarcane digs deep and under the skin of horrific atrocity but also the beauty of love and family. The system of residential schools was not just in Canada it was massive in the US and similar schools existed all over the world, required viewing for anyone who loves cinema and/or wants to understand colonization.",False
14,4,"Heavy on mood, light on substance",junior-bonner,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yet another so-called prestige documentary that buries its mission of serious intent under tedious, repetitive scenes of mood-setting and music cues that are designed to convey mystery and portent, but are really a signal that the filmmakers are stretching their 20 minutes of subject matter into a feature-length running time. This film is made almost exclusively with filler, but don't point this out to the documentary intelligentsia. They will merely accuse you of being too stupid to get it. As a documentary filmmaker myself, scratching out an existence on the fringes of the industry, I am so tired of these types of docs, made by a committee top heavy with executive producers (look at the IMDB credit list!).",False
15,10,Unforgettable,susanjaneharris,n/a,16/08/2025,This extraordinary film has impressed viewers world wide in the last while. It is the most profound documentary I have seen this year and it deeply impacted me. I am Canadian but reside in the US. I was woefully ignorant of our history until I saw this film in NY. It was illuminating and moving. At times I found it difficult to watch but the filmmakers approached the subject with great care and empathy. They did an outstanding job of capturing the culture of the reservation and the cinematography was just beautiful. This film makes a vital contribution to our understanding of the residential school crises across North America and the multi generational impact it has had on all survivors and their descendents. I am overwhelmed by the filmmakers commitment to helping the participants of the film tell their stories in an authentic and fulsome way. I offer my admiration and respect to their courage and congratulate the filmmakers on their exceptional work.,False
16,10,Outstanding,tbozinova,n/a,16/08/2025,"An outstanding film that has remained with me since I saw it at Sundance. It is full of empathy and humanity. Beautifully shot, it captures the landscape of the reservation and the colourful celebrations. More importantly, it explores the depths of the residential school crises and the courage of the survivors to speak their truth and tell their tragic stories. It is also ne extraordinary story of redemption as it explores the relationship between Julian and his father, the only baby on the reservation not incinerated in 1959. The most powerful documentary I have seen. A film like this should be essential viewing.",False
17,10,"Extraordinary,shocking,essential viewing",dkassie-32771,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this beautiful but upsetting documentary last week. It moved me to tears and has lingered in my thoughts. The cinematography including the landscape around the reservation and the extravagant colors of the ceremonies was gorgeous. If it were not for the harrowing nature of the subject matter,this could be an art film. The filmmakers,did a masterful job of gaining the trust of the participants and it allowed them to tell their stories in an authentic way. It feels that the,making of this film was cathartic to the survivors, finally allowing them to self express and heal. For this alone,this exceptional film is deserving of recognition. To me, this film stands out more than any other documentary I have seen in the last few years. Truly exceptional in every way.",False
18,3,Couldn't even finish it,tonimichelle2,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is UNBELIEVABLY dull. I Documentaries are my favorite genre. I didn't think it possible for a film about physical abuse, sexual abuse and murder to be unbearable to sit through. And it was dull every minute of the hour and fifteen minutes I watched it until I stopped watching it. I think the filmmakers were trying to make it artsy. I also agree with others that there was a complete lack of editing here. I don't remember ever writing a negative review for a documentary until now. Usually I can at least appreciate the passion that goes into these films. There are plenty of excellent podcasts and docs on these schools. Only watch this if you have insomnia.",False
19,10,Stunning,saimariejohnson,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is heartwrenching and life altering. The stories of survivors are harrowing and full of despair that seems to seep through the screen with palpable sadness that reflects the depth of pain, loss and suffering of the First Nation's people in Canada and greater Turtle Island. Even more turmoil than anyone should ever endure is revealed by the stories of those who are victims and were buried in secrecy and evasion to cover up the abuses of clergy and the government on the most vulnerable and innocent. It's a must see for anyone who cares about the ongoing genocide of tribes and the untold stories that are now being brought to light after generations of continual exploitation.Any and all activists who care about these matters should watch this and raise awareness for the voiceless lost relatives that for so long went ignored.5 stars.",False
20,10,Most important and impactful documentary of the year,susanharrisexecutivecoach,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sugarcane has left a huge impact on indigenous communities across North America, particularly Williams Lake where the participants were able to express themselves freely after a lifetime of repression and silence. This film has helped this traumatized community to heal, raised awareness, and compelled the PM, President and the Pope to issue long awaited apologies. Those who deny the tragedies of the residential schools and the impact on their survivors have chosen not to educate themselves on our country's history.The film is beautifully shot and captures the wild beauty of the reservation and the landscape. It is so unlike any other documentary in its art form and lack of narration. We were all extremely moved by this film and feel that it deserves the critical acclaim it has received world wide. But surely, there is no greater reward than exposing the truth and easing the pain of those whose lives were so negatively impacted. In my view, out of a sea of excellent documentaries, Sugarcane stands out as the most outstanding one this year.",False
21,10,"Unmarked Graves, Unbroken Spirits",pinkmanboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some films don't just recount historical events; they lay them bare, raw and impossible to ignore. ""Sugarcane,"" directed by Emily Kassie and Julian Brave Noisecat, is one of those. More than just an exposé of the horrors committed in Catholic residential schools for Indigenous children in North America, this documentary is a cry for justice, a tribute to resilience, and a brutal reminder of how the past still reverberates in the present.Centered on the crimes committed at St. Joseph's Mission in Williams Lake, Canada, ""Sugarcane"" unfolds as a deep and painful investigation, shedding light on the lives of those who survived-and those who didn't. The discovery of unmarked graves at the site sparked the film's creation, but Kassie and Noisecat don't stop at presenting the facts. They pull us into the human experience, exploring the scars left by generations of abuse, neglect, and cultural genocide.What sets ""Sugarcane"" apart is its deeply personal approach. Julian Brave Noisecat, co-director and narrator, weaves his own family's story into the larger narrative. The impact of these schools on his grandmother, his father, and, by extension, himself, makes the film more intimate. It's not just about anonymous victims; it's about real families, real lives, and real people struggling every day to bear the weight of a past that's never truly been laid to rest. This emotional connection is the beating heart of the documentary.The direction is meticulous, balancing the brutality of the subject matter with cultural and visual beauty. The use of sweeping landscapes and traditional Indigenous sounds creates a powerful contrast to the horrors being described. It's as if the film is saying, ""Look at what was lost, but also at what survived."" This contrast enriches the narrative, reminding viewers of the strength and resilience of Indigenous cultures, even in the face of systematic attempts to erase them.The testimonies of survivors and investigators are devastating. There's no room for doubt or for downplaying the crimes committed. Accounts of physical and sexual abuse, murder, and the systematic destruction of cultural identity are presented directly but never sensationalized. Kassie and Noisecat treat their interviewees with tangible respect, letting their voices come through without unnecessary filters. Moments of silence, when words fail, are just as powerful as the most detailed accounts.The film doesn't shy away from holding institutions accountable. The lack of an adequate response from the Canadian government and the Catholic Church is confronted head-on. Empty speeches and symbolic gestures, like Pope Francis's lukewarm apology, are shown as grossly insufficient given the magnitude of the crimes. This approach underscores the urgent need for concrete action, meaningful reparations, and the return of stolen cultural artifacts.One of the most striking aspects of ""Sugarcane"" is how it links the past to the present. The documentary doesn't just recount historical abuses; it also examines the enduring consequences for Indigenous communities. High rates of suicide, substance abuse, and intergenerational trauma are presented as part of the legacy of these schools. Yet the film also offers hope. Through stories of survival and resistance, it shows how these communities continue to fight to preserve their cultures and heal their wounds.Overall, ""Sugarcane"" transcends the traditional documentary format. It's not just a denunciation; it's a deeply emotional and human work. It's impossible to walk away from it unchanged. The film forces us to confront history head-on but also to celebrate the strength of those who, against all odds, are still here-singing, dancing, and passing their stories down. It's not an easy watch, but it's essential. It's a call for collective responsibility and a powerful tribute to a people who, despite everything, persist.",False
22,2,Unremarkable and unsatisfying,jeffsrrrrr,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst of all, I would like to say that I believe there were abuses committed at this school and others. I am not commenting on that aspect, only the quality of the film itself.The film, though supposedly about the happenings at the school, only talks about that for maybe 20% of it. The rest is random unrelated scenes of people filling a truck with gas, a dance contest, a pizza party, mowing the lawn...cows, etc, etc. The editing is atrocious.When anything about the school is actually mentioned, it is never elaborated upon. For instance, they searched for children's graves and said they possibly found some things that may be graves, but no excavation was done, and never mentioned again.One of the subjects was that a baby was put in an incinerator, but it was found in it alive and unharmed, and the mother admitted that she did it, and spent time in jail for child abandonment.Again, I'm sure that the children there may have not been treated the way they should have been, but this movie does absolutely nothing to show or prove that.One scene, which I found almost offensive is where they brought an elderly woman to a field to point out where children had been buried, and it was clear that she was suffering severe health issues, and possibly mental issues. It seemed they were using any way to prove the point of the movie, which they failed to do.A good faith effort that failed miserably.",True
23,8,The pain just ripples and cascades,ajcarson-30471,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe pain and the consequences of all the abuse just continue to roar on through these families and communities like a river. My heart broke over and over for the brave people who shared their stories of pain, loss, and fear. Some talked of being beaten and punished for reporting that they had been raped. Others mentioned running away, but being afraid to return to their families, whether out of fear that the priests would come back for them, or that their own families would return them to their abusers. They talked of the fear of lying in the dark in the dormitories as the abusive priests came into the room, and of the friends who simply disappeared or met mysterious deaths. Many became alcoholics or abused drugs as adults, perpetuating the pain by abandoning their own children and families. One white man who had been charged with cleaning out the incinerator and digging holes for the priests had been tormented for years by nightmares of the bone fragments and other evidence of the infants and children disposed of there.One particularly poignant story was of a man who continually denied that he was the product of rape by one of the priests, even after DNA evidence linked him to the man's descendants, coming back as 45% Irish and 5% Scottish. His wife repeated the evidence, but he refused to accept it and said it wasn't the proof he needed. At the very end, he finally was able to voice the fact that his mother was raped by a priest, and that he, too, had been abused.While the pace was slow and the editing uneven, some of the photography was beautiful. I'm so glad I watched it, but it will haunt me for a long time, as it should.",True
24,n/a,Heartfelt documentary,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SUGARCANE (2024) Nominated for Best Documentary Feature. Instead of righteous (and justified) anger, filmmakers Julian Brave Noisecat and Emily Kassie take an introspective and personal viewpoint in telling their sad story of the Canadian Residential education program where Native Indigenous Tribe members were placed in predominantly Catholic run boarding schools (similar programs were also set up in the U. S.).The St. Joseph's Mission which the Documentary focuses on, was the site of such horrors as underage pregnancies, sexual abuse, violence, deaths and even murder. Noisecat's father was one of the victims who survived. Many others weren't so fortunate. The cover-up and lies involving Priests who, even when found to be molesters, were simply transferred to other reservations.What distinguishes SUGARCANE (named for the location of the Mission) is how it displays that the crimes committed there have reverberated through multiple generations. St. Joseph's closed in 1981, but the program lasted until 1997. It's a dark cloud that looms over the Secwepemc people. Noisecat and Kassie never over-dramatize and let the people tell their own stories (including Noisecat and his father). As one elder implores early on that she wants the younger Secwepemc to ""bear witness"" to the events in order for their nation to heal.",False
25,8,Ghosts From Our Dark Past,Sil-Azevedo,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a time when erasing history is touted as the way back to greatness, this film offers a different take: remembering our darkest moments gives us a chance to heal, learn, and do better.The film is a beautifully shot documentary that weaves the stories of Indigenous students who suffered unspeakable torment at the hands of the Canadian Indian residential school system. This is not an isolated incident, as there were hundreds of similar schools in Canada and the U. S. with the goal of ""assimilating"" Natives into the European culture.From the National Geographic page for the film:
""In 2021, evidence of unmarked graves was discovered on the grounds of an Indian residential school run by the Catholic Church in Canada. After years of silence, the forced separation, assimilation and abuse many children experienced at these segregated boarding schools was brought to light, sparking a national outcry against a system designed to destroy Indigenous communities. Set amidst a groundbreaking investigation, SUGARCANE illuminates the beauty of a community breaking cycles of intergenerational trauma and finding the strength to persevere.""This film premiered at Sundance, where it won the Grand Jury award for Directing. It is one of the five nominees for Best Feature Documentary at this year's Oscars and has a 100% rating on the Tomatometer (with 65 reviews). Don't let the Disney label fool you. This is not a light film. It is a punch to the gut, but also tender, beautiful and healing. And we need this more than ever if we hope to be truly great.",False

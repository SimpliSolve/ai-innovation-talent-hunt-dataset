1,10,Sober and Enlightening,couturieranne,n/a,15/08/2025,An excellent documentary! This film is showing how we've gotten to where we are currently with the tragedy of abortion. I think every individual should watch this film prior to deciding where they stand on the issue. I believe anyone watching would have a difficult time not recognizing the sanctity of life.,False
2,10,Thought Provoking and Sobering,veritysvillage,n/a,15/08/2025,"Even as a lifelong pro-life advocate, I learned much and felt spurred to action after seeing this film. I highly recommend it, especially in group settings, as I think it would be beneficial to verbally process what you see in order to move from passively viewing to actively engaging an issue that simply cannot be ignored.",False

4,10,Perfect,ericagraves-60371,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nicely done. It gives me more love to spread. I appreciate the analogies too..like why would the Cancer association needs to fix another 20 problems. Not sure why people think killing a baby is related to so many other other problems. Apparently, they can't see that the truth.",False

7,10,Amazing,zyrizdelatorre,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie was so helpful in figuring out what abortion truly is. I knew what it was but not to the extent the movie had shown. If you are pro life, even pro choice, please watch this film.",False

9,10,Truth and grace!,CaroToscoTres,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film was extremely well done, and perfectly balances the gut wrenching truth about abortion with the sweetness of grace in dealing with those who support it and/or have experienced it.My friend and I were blessed to have unknowingly had the director and writer, Tracy Robinson, in the theater with us. I'm thankful for having had the opportunity to thank her in person for making it, and for being able to tell her what a phenomenal job she did. She chose the perfect spokespersons, each of them articulating their point and/or testimony so beautifully.This movie truly has the potential of making a huge difference in how people view abortion. Pray that God will use it in a mighty way.",False

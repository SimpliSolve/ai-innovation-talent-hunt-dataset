1,8,A moving behind-the-scenes documentary,BeneCumb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Young Royals Forever offers a heartfelt farewell to the beloved Swedish series Young Royals. It follows the cast and crew as they bring the third and final season to a close, offering an intimate look into the show's creative journey-from writing and casting to filming its emotional final scenes.The documentary showcases the deep care and dedication the team poured into the project, especially lead actors Edvin Ryding (Wilhelm) and Omar Rudberg (Simon). Their genuine off-screen friendship and on-screen chemistry make the farewell all the more poignant.What makes this documentary particularly touching is the comfort and sense of representation it provides. Emotional goodbyes between cast members and the final lake scene stand out as especially powerful moments. The creators also reflect on the show's deeper themes-such as forging your own path, the importance of friendship, and the meaning of found family. The documentary highlights the supportive, nurturing environment fostered on set-an atmosphere that helped the young cast grow both personally and professionally. It's clear that everyone involved truly cared: about the story, each other, and the fans. This sincerity makes the ending feel genuinely meaningful.Young Royals Forever is a fitting, bittersweet send-off-a reminder that, even though the show has ended, its impact will live on in the hearts and imaginations of its audience. I'd give it 8 out of 10-pretty solid, especially since I usually prefer finished stories over behind-the-scenes content ðŸ˜Š. Now I can't help but wonder... could Older Royals ever be a thing?",False
2,10,I have no words this show is literally perfect,shiri-85715,n/a,16/08/2025,I found this show when I was at my lowest and it saved me quite literally. I met this guy at the time and he was exactly like William. We stopped talking after I fall in love with him and I had to let him go it was hard and then I found Young Royals and every time Simon was on the screen I saw myself and it helped me deal with him ignoring me so yeah this show always hit different for me. Now it's over I'm sad but now I know that I can keep going and leave this dude in the past. I wanna thanks however made this show because it found me in the perfect time and it filled a hole that he was supposed to fill.,False
3,10,Simply beautiful,doomedplanets,n/a,16/08/2025,"A little late to the party, haha. I'm usually not a big fan of documentaries, never really liked sitting through them. But watching this one didn't feel like a chore, I guess. I watched it all the way through with full focus. Young Royals itself is such a touching series, and getting to see the behind the scenes elevates the experience. Seeing the chemistry and bonds between the cast was awesome. Knowing the amount of effort and time that was put into the acting and embodiment of the characters made it all feel so much more emotional. This is a really great documentary for a really great series.",False

1,8,Interesting,smweiss-718-248874,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mark Cavendish is a legendary cyclist and his story is a compelling one. The ups and downs of his career are extraordinary by any measure, and they are viscerally presented in this documentary.Where the documentary truly succeeds is in not over-romanticizing Cavendish's character. He's a biking god, and his setbacks arouse real sympathy, but he's also a bit of an a-hole (a favorite coach's evaluation) and the movie is comfortable presenting come unvarnished truths about this sports ""hero.""The real star here may well be the Tour de France bike race, and its importance as a great iconic event is artfully established here. The camera work is particularly compelling when the racers are racing and all in all the film is a good ride.One last thing, every third word in the dialogue is the f-word so be advised if that sort of thing is in any way offensive to you.",False
2,8,Great except for Lance Armstrong comments.,michaelloproto,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can highly recommend this documentary into this amazing complex character in sport let alone road cycling. I love his honesty and his no BS attitude. There were also interesting insights into his home life and how it affects his family whether he wins or loses or crashes. What I hated was having to listen to the greatest narcissistic drug cheat of all time Lance Armstrong. His arrogance astounds me and what ever he says means nothing to me and has no place in cycling. His response would be that he has seven yellow jerseys and I have none, but he doesn't, he got them cheating and being unapologetically abusive to those who stood up to him. Shame on you Netflix for giving him a voice.",False
3,7,The best sprinter there ever was in pro cycling,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Mark Cavendish: Never Enough"" (2023 release; 92 min.) opens, we see footage from 1996 where a then young boy Mark is interviewed on British television. Flash forward to ""2016 Tour de France"" as Cavendish keeps getting closer to tie the 34 stage wins of the greatest pro cyclist of all time, Eddy Merckx. We then go to stage 1 of the 2017 Tour de France, where events take a dramatic turn... At this point we are 10 minutes into the film.Couple of comments: this is the latest from British producer-director Alex Kiehl (""Bad Sport""), Here he reassesses the storied career of British cyclist Mark Cavendish, who make his fame and fortune primarily though his yearly participation in the Tour de France, THE most famous cycling event in the world. The film makers seem to have gotten unfettered access to Cavendish over a period of years. Without giving anything away, I can say this: the documentary of course shows highlights of Cavendish's career, but really is a study of what a man does when he is down and almost out. It makes for fascinating viewing, although I cannot understand why the movie ends with the 2021 Tour de France, and then there is zero mention of what happened afterwards. Look it up!""Mark Cavendish: Never Enough"" started airing recently on Netflix. Whether you are already familiar with Mark Cavendish (as I was) or you have no idea who this guy is, I guarantee that this documentary will catch and keep your attention from start to finish. Of course don't take my word for it, so check it out and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,9,Greatest living sportsman today in UK - thrill watch,malikrob,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a brutal, emotional and entertaining story, captured into a lively netflix entertaining movie.The life he has lived and is still is living today is unreal, and as cycling is still not a major sport in the UK, the reception of him is not as high as he deserves. This story could really go on if he continues the career one more time!Well interviewed people in the movie, great family links and the story really traces back to the heart of his cycling career in the UK - Isle of Man as a young child.Maybe the movie could of captured more on the 2022 + 23 stories, but no doubt this will feed into the final movie if it continues into 2024.Not a cycling fan but if you enjoy sporting true entertainment shows, strongly recommended.",False
5,10,A must watch for parents of athletes,behawkins-85859,n/a,16/08/2025,"You do not need to be a fan of pro cycling to get something from this film. I do think if you have a student athlete, where the game is their whole identity, this is an important film to watch so that you understand how to help them make the transition, when the game is done. Watching Mark, overcome his demons, watching his wife, stand by his side, and his mentors and coaches give him another chance was life-affirming. This is an inside look into what it is like to be a professional athlete on a come back that may or may not happen. There is never a guarantee. Mark overcame so many things, beating the odds. I didn't know his story when I watched the tour this past summer (2023) . I'm rooting for him, for another comeback following yet another catastrophic injury .",False
6,9,A Human and Thrilling Ride,os-navar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix's ""MARK CAVENDISH: NEVER ENOUGH"" stands out in the sports docuseries lineup. It authentically explores cyclist Mark Cavendish's life without sensationalism, seamlessly blending athletic excitement with a nuanced look at mental health. Beyond sports, the documentary delves into the human condition, using Cavendish's journey as a metaphor for resilience. It offers a poignant reflection on universal themes and adds depth with insightful discussions on mental health challenges. The film's skillful cinematography immerses viewers in Cavendish's world, making it more than just a sports documentary; it's an authentic exploration of the human spirit by Netflix.",False
7,4,Unresolved trauma,tim-bishop-90,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWell. I think there are a few really good elements in this documentary, especially the darker parts of Mark's path and how his friends tried to help him recover. However, seeing him breaking down that bad, mentally, makes me question if the whole rebuilding process isn't all stacked on only winning again. Because if this is the core meaning of his life, he will never be around for his family, he will keep ignoring his wife and his kids, and he will break again the moment he loses even once. Personally, I don't think that a single aspect of his trauma has been truly resolved. You see this in the closing seconds of the documentary, and you saw it in his eyes when he had to quit the 2023 Tour de France.",True

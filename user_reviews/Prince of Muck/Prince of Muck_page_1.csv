3,10,A beautiful cinematic masterpiece,ellenwilkinson,n/a,16/08/2025,This was such a moving film detailing the ups and downs of life in a small island community. The resilience and spirit of the local people is portrayed so powerfully. This is such a personal and beautifully shot piece. The long shots of the stunning Scottish landscapes mixed with the intricacies of rural life are mesmerising. For those who love wild Scotland it's a must see and even for those who are unfamiliar it's a great story of family relationships and life. I've watched it many times since it's release and I can't recommend it enough. It is a touching tribute to a man that loved his island.,False

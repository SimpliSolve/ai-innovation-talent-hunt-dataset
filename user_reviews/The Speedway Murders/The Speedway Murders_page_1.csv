1,7,Really well done!,ace-00836,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI liked how they gave the victims a voice in this film. It was very different from the usual true crime stuff we see. Has a bit of stranger things vibe to it as well. I'm really not sure why there's a 500 character minimum to leave a review here. I don't have much else to say other than that. I really liked the film and the fact that they used the victims perspective to outline various theories on the crime. Clearly the speedway Police department did a terrible job in the investigation. The fact that the police were called the night of the crime came to the restaurant and saw a missing money, missing staff and just chalked it up to careless teenagers close the door doors and told him to open for business in the morning is crazy.",True
2,8,"Intimate dissection of a senseless, complex case",bob_meg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Adam Kamien and Luke Rynderman take a lot of risks with ""The Speedway Murders"", a true crime doc that posits five diverse theories on a cold case that's baffled authorities for over 45 years.On an evening in November 1978, four Indiana teenagers were abducted at gunpoint from closing a robbed Burger Chef only to be found in a nearby county, days later, apparently shot and stabbed in an almost execution-style manner.Nothing about this case is clear cut. The motives are murky, the suspects are myriad, theories extending into drugs and massive debts are tossed out and debated hotly by cops, ex-cons, and family and friends of the victims. It's a lot to digest, but fortunately Kamien and Rynderman manage to laser in and lay bare the emotionalism and attendant PTSD of the tragedy without inordinate exploitation.This is a documentary that makes no bones that its focus is on the four young employees of the restaurant rather than on the possible suspects, living or dead, maybe even more than the actual crime itself --- an approach likely to annoy many hard true crime addicts. It's a wise choice, though, because without that accent on humanism the film would never keep one's attention due to its many contradictory theories and suppositions. It's a unique, gripping experience because unlike a lot of crime docs, you're almost thrust into the position of actively solving the case as you watch the film. It's not a reductive set of flashbacks.The structure is unique yet somewhat repetitive, but I actually found that to be more stabilizing than distracting. You really get a feel for the ""Burger Chef Four's"" individual personalities and their connections with each other, even though much of their interrelations are speculative. In perhaps the most unique facet of the film, instead of relying on strict, vague reenactments, the kids often recount the events of the night, debate the clues, examine the suspects in longer-than average takes, almost but never completely breaking the fourth wall (which might have been more interesting, actually).The actors who play the teens aren't striving for drama as much as authenticity, and if there's any shortcomings to this approach it's more in the clinical nature of their lines than in the line-readings themselves. This borderline Verite approach is not going to fly with many conventional doc audiences, I don't think, but if you're in the mood for something a little more unconventional, I think you'll enjoy it.This isn't a case with a scope or sensationalism on par with the Manson murders or the Zodiac, but in its own way it's as immediate and disturbing, if only for the length of time it has taken for it to come to a plausible resolution and how many lives it touched and fractured in the process.",False
3,7,Fast food mystery,Bigweight66,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't aware of this tragic event, so watching it was both sad and interesting (in a strange way).In 1978 four teenagers who all work together at a fast food restaurant are tragically killed. The story is told in a respectful manner, goes into detail and moves at a good pace. A few different scenarios of the evening are proposed. You will find yourself trying to pick the most likely scenario to crack the case.The story has an interesting twist as actors play the victims who speak about the tragic night. This gives the documentary a slightly deeper insight. You feel sorrow for each teenager, their friends and family.The world is a terrible place at times.",False
4,10,Definitely Recommend,Suxana1212,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was very much looking forward to this documentary because I have been following this unsolved case for quite a while now...several years. I was very impressed with the style and format on how it was presented. I also liked that they explored several known theories on why this senseless crime happened. I absolutely LOVED how they brought these people back to life for us. It was hauntingly beautiful, and I didn't want it to end. I don't usually like to give a perfect score for anything, but I was just so captivated with this film. The authenticity to time and culture of 1978 mid American teenagers was spot on as well.",False
5,10,Inventive and Compelling Take on a Terrible Unsolved Case,notlinda,n/a,16/08/2025,"The filmmakers' approach to telling this story is unique, compassionate, and effective as they put forth multiple competing theories, from the perspective of detectives, witnesses, families, and the victims themselves.We attended a premiere screening in Indianapolis, followed by a Q&A with the (Australian!) filmmakers and several of the key players featured in the production. The ""Burger Chef murders,"" the name by which locals know the tragic crime, has haunted locals for more than 40 years. Even though we have never forgotten about it, the film presented a great deal of information and insight that had not previously come to light.One of the best true crime films I've seen. Cannot recommend highly enough.",False
6,5,Scary Sounds Every Few Seconds,chopperDavo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know why, but the producers of these documentaries often see the need to insert creepy, scary, jarring sounds on a continual basis.It cheapens the whole thing. Makes any true crime program into a low brow 'B' movie type of thing.The rest of it is not too bad. Having the kids involved int he story telling is unique. I don't really like it, but it's interesting.There's no answers of course. Which is fine, you know that at the start. But half way through, I was debating whether to continue this.I think there are many better true crime documentaries out there other than this. Watch one of them.",False
7,10,A Bold Yet Humanising Portrayal of a Shocking Quadruple Murder,jorkeno,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was initially unsure about the narrative style in which the actors who portray the victims walk through and discuss the various theories themselves, however by the end I knew the directors had nailed it in a truly humanizing way.This true crime docu-drama is unique not only in its narrative structure, but also in the quality of the production design, soundtrack, cinematography, use of colour, and tasteful, high quality reenactment scenes and dialogue.The filmmakers clearly earned the trust of the various witnesses, police officers and family and friends of the victims as evidenced by the degree of openness and emotion demonstrated by them in the film.By the end, I was in tears.",False
8,2,PAINFULLY SLOW AND REPETETIVE,mrcjking,n/a,16/08/2025,"How can this have an 8.2 rating when all they're doing is showing a different scenario of the same scenes over and over and over again? The only reason I paid to watch it was because of the 8.2 rating. I am halfway through and giving this review because it's so frustrating. I want to stop watching it. They've given me virtually no information and just keep showing the same scenes with different dialogue over and over. Now to make this review I have another 150 characters to put in so, I'm just going to blather different words that don't make any sense and doesn't have anything to do with the review.",False
9,9,Well done,paulbarboot,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Speedway Murders is a gripping and well-researched true crime documentary that masterfully explores the chilling 1978 Burger Chef murders. With a balanced mix of archival footage, expert interviews, and dramatic reenactments, the film keeps viewers engaged while shedding light on a decades-old mystery. The pacing is strong, building suspense without feeling exploitative, and the storytelling remains respectful to the victims. While some questions remain unanswered, the documentary does an excellent job of presenting the case and possible theories. A must-watch for true crime fans. 9/10 and god bless the victims and their families.",False
10,9,"Quality, sad documentary. Great for true crime fans",beherenow3,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is done in a unique way, it mixes interviews with all the key players (family, suspects, friends of suspects), with dramatisations giving voice to the victims - there are actors playing the four victims and talking to each other (in character, in the restaurant, as they clean up etc) about the case and the likelihood of each theory. At first I thought, ""this is a bit cheesy, c'mon guys"". But after a while I realised how good it is. So sad. Senseless. Giving the victims actual life, mixed in with family interviews makes it even sadder. The polite 17 yr old girl who kept a diary, looking forward to turning 18 soon. The guy wanting to make the basketball team. The other guy wanting some pocket money for xmas presents. Such a bloody waste by a cold blooded killer.",False
11,5,Could have been good,Mrtriplesicx,n/a,16/08/2025,Could have been good but they continuously go back to a scene of the victims talking about themselves in the third person it's extremely distracting and doesn't make any sense and after the first few times it gets really annoying (they do it a lot so be prepared) i really struggle to understand that creative direction choice other than that it's not that bad but that really convoluted the whole story enough for me to not able to rate it above a 5.,False

1,9,Great story very well done.,gabore9-428-222670,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is Carolla's best documentary so far. Great pacing, suspense and a very charismatic protagonist. He was very pleased with this on his podcast, but rightly so.",False
2,9,Well made Documentary,ayojerkinskarega,n/a,17/08/2025,"Production: Very good production. Edited well for the amount of information it gives, at times too much information. Also, very smooth transitions, easy to follow story. 9/10.On Screen: The passion and rawness of Willy T. Ribbs makes this documentary. Also, the other people, professional drivers and experts, give context to the story of Willy T. Ribbs. At times, some of the information given wasn't necessary to the main story. For example, it shows the articles and stories about Bill Cosby's criminal charges which is redundant and took away from Willy T Ribbs's story. Lastly if you don't know the language of auto racing or cars, then at times, you can get lost because of how technical they get. 8/10.Content/Impact: Willy T Ribbs's story is a phenomenal story about the first black man to drive the Indianapolis 500. His resolve and the racism that he overcomes, is an inspiration for black people, and POC, who experience racism, that we can overcome and still be great. 10/10.Overall: Excellent story about an extraordinary black man who excelled in his profession, faced adversity, and despite racism, succeeded. Stories like this needs to be told more often. Overall I'll give it a 9/10.",False
3,9,Inspirational and Motivating,aboriginalel,n/a,17/08/2025,I knew of some of his accomplishments but never knew the backstory. Mr. Ribbs along with others during this time raised the level of consciousness in America concerning race issues and how he never played the victim but looked at his struggles as hurdles rather than brick walls. Lewis Hamilton is standing on one of his shoulders.,False
4,10,"Wow, in tears for the right reasons!",rafaeljrtorres,n/a,17/08/2025,"Is a sad movie that reminds us how bad it was/still is racism (injustice) but had me with tears of joy at the end, knowing that Wllly never give up.Extremity well produced documentary with an outstanding narrative, that brings hope by showing us that not all white guys in Motorsports are evil... because indeed, it is a cut throat field where the good bud white guys network always seems to win...Well done, well done Adama Carolla!PS: people that blames his attitude had never been treated differently for no apparent reason, or ask themselves why I have to try harder than my counter parts? A victim of society, Willy was in fight mode at all time and on top having to prove he had something to offer to the teams as the other drivers (caucasian), and since is Motorsports, Willy had to prove that he was better than them, because that's why we rave!",False
5,10,Damn,emoidiot187,n/a,17/08/2025,I knew a bit about Willy but wanted to know more. Thank God this documentary came out. So well done and entertaining. I rarely cry during docs but...,False
6,10,Hits all the marks of quality documentary film making,fwpahlke,n/a,17/08/2025,"As documentary film makers, Adam Carola and Nate Adams have hit all the marks to allow me to give them five stars out of five for their look at Willy T. Ribbs, the first black man to quality and race in the ""greatest spectacle in racing"", the Indianapolis 500. This is quality film making that tells the little known story of the Jackie Robinson of auto racing, Willy T. Ribbs. The high production values present some of the best film of car racing to go along with many interviews of the people involved in the sport, ""Uppity..."" is highly recommended for historians of both sport and car racing. Viewed and playing on Netflix.",False
7,10,Brilliant!,alanperkins-39535,n/a,17/08/2025,"I didn't know anything about Willy T. Ribbs before watching this and very little about American motorsport (oval tracks to an Englishman are generally scoffed at), but by the time I reached the last 20mins of this documentary I was rooting for that man like I have never rooted for anyone before.
Willy isn't a household name with multiple world championships to his name (although in a colour-blind world he might well have been), but his story/career is one of the most inspiring in any sport.
Whether motor racing is your thing or not this is well worth watching.",False
8,6,"Interesting, but evident you're only one side of the story",grantmangec,n/a,17/08/2025,"Pretty good motor sport doco. I'm a NZer and don't know much about US motorsport, so it was interesting to see historical Nascar, Trans Am, Atlantic Championship, IMSA and Indie car racing and more.All in all enjoyable, but you do start to get a strong sense that Willy T had a big ego and enjoyed boasting, something people rarely find endearing regardless of skin colour. While there was doubtless racism going on, you get the sense that the race card is being played too often to explain this or that problem. There's always two sides to the story and this, for better or worse, is definitely a one sided story by a proud racer. It would have been interesting to hear the full story from those that stood accused.One thing that stood out is the supposed intentional crashing of Willy T by Pruett in IMSA. The footage looked like Pruett had the inside line and Willy T turned in on him. The camera angle didn't do Willy T any favours for his side of the story. To hear that Willy T then hit the guy while he sat inside a car next to a woman just wasn't cool, but Willy T is portrayed as the victim in all of it.To recap, decently interesting for people into racing. However critical watchers will note that this is definitely a very one sided story.",False
9,10,Awesome,ellenwood-92428,n/a,17/08/2025,Really enjoyed this Doc! If you like any form of racing you will love this. Never knew much about Willy T but glad I do now. Thank you Adam Carroll's for this!,False
10,7,Good story but some important detaild hided,soniaperinga,n/a,17/08/2025,"Good documentary, well done, but there are some important details hided as the fact Willy was arrested for reckless driving before the 1978 World 600. That was the reason he couldn't compete in that race. He wasn't well welcome in NASCAR and other series because he was very arrogant, not for his skin colour. There were some others black drivers in NASCAR before him as George Wiltshire, Randy Bethea, Charlie Scott, Elias Bowie and Wendell Scott, who also won a race.",False
11,10,"A sublime pleasure for racing fans, but also beyond interesting for everyone else",packers-81353,n/a,17/08/2025,"Who knew Adam Carolla had such chops!? This documentary--another in Adam's growing line of racing-inspired documentaries, is not only an inspirational and emotionally gripping account of a truly great black race car driver, but is also an interesting case study within the long saga of American racing. I can only imagine the amount of legwork and research Carolla and his team did. Amazing end product. DO NOT MISS this excellent documentary, and let's hope this is the start of a long series of eye-popping docs from Carolla's Chassy Media. BRAVO!",False
12,7,Very good for race fans,Vindelander,n/a,17/08/2025,Pretty good documentary about someone that I'd never heard of - even as an ardent petroleum head. Slightly at odds with David Hobbs account of their Can-Am pairing and possibly rather exaggerated in some places but here's a guy who could have achieved so much more but for the colour of his skin.Well worth watching and you'll see some great live footage and learn about his successes in the UK as well,False
13,3,Sad,fastdenny,n/a,17/08/2025,"I grew up going to some of those race tracks during that time. Saw Bobby Rahal, Jim Truesdale, PLN, and I do remember Willy T. I can't recall thinking anything but what a good race driver he was. It was sad to see this film turn into a ""poor me""piece. We all wanted to drive race cars back then, and even now still do, but it costs money! He just wasn't a very good salesman. Plain and Simple. Yes, there was alot of racism back then, but things were changing in this country. A lot of white guys helped him in his career. Dont forget that.",False
14,10,Gripping story,ewrwco-93207,n/a,17/08/2025,Such a fantastic story that's not known by many. Well done production that keeps you in suspense to find out what happened.,False
15,10,Expertly done one of the best documentaries I've seen,muamba_eats_toast,n/a,17/08/2025,"Everything about this was done perfectly in my eyes. Before watching I'd never heard of him yet by the end I had both knowledge of him but was also emotionally invested in him to the point I was tearing up in happiness at the end for him! A wonderful in detail look into his life, the person he is and the roubles he faced. Would recommend to literally anybody that they watch this if they get the chance!",False
16,10,Another Great Car Doc,wgordon-28138,n/a,17/08/2025,Moving story that people outside the motoring world needed to hear,False
17,9,"Sorry, never heard of him.......my mistake",dummy-79,n/a,17/08/2025,"I've never heard of Willy T. I'm not a motor sports fan.Wow, thank you Netflix. Thank you Willy T. It was an honor to learn about you.",False
18,10,Great,ab18-133-232228,n/a,17/08/2025,"What a great and necessary documentary. The trail blazing Mr Ribbs did was inspiring. And as with all of Adam Carolla s docs, it was well put together. Thx.",False
19,9,Right on!,joesfunhouse-436-545527,n/a,17/08/2025,"Very enjoyable movie about an awesome driver with more determination than most. He also had a good sense of humor in my opinion. I thought it was executed very well and it was easy to follow throughout his twisting career.
Thank you for the history lesson!",False
20,9,That's How You Make A Documentary,iquine,n/a,17/08/2025,"(Flash Review)Before Lewis Hamilton there was Willy T. Tibbs. minus the 6 (and counting) championships. Ribbs, who can race any type of car super-fast is also super confident, doesn't mince words and knows what he wants and nothing stops him from his desires. In the late 70s and into the 80s he gets spotty racing opportunities and wherever he lands has exceptional success yet often the color of his skin limits his opportunities as well as limited funding options. While he has Formula 1 aspirations, his true goal is to make it into the Indy 500 and he would be the first African American to run in the 500. This was really well told and edited and paced. Ribbs is a hoot and a smart guy and if giving fair opportunities could have been a huge name.",False
21,9,A must watch for any sport fans,tbrennantb,n/a,17/08/2025,If you have any interest what so ever in any motor sport you need to see this..a sad indictment of America not so long ago..a truly brilliant documentary I really really enjoyed it.,False
22,10,10/10 Excellent,BomageMinimart,n/a,17/08/2025,"Amazing film. Willy T. Ribbs totally rocks! Seriously, I'd really like to meet him; he seems like a great guy. Astonishing story and achievements. Much respect and love for his total commitment to his goals.",False
23,10,Loved it,hgcop,n/a,17/08/2025,I loved every second of this documentary! I had never heard of this gentleman. I was so glad I got the recommendation. Only detracting factor was them bringing up Bill Cosby's acts later in life. That had nothing to do with Willy T. Ribbs. Besides that it was a perfect story.,False
24,10,Had Me Wanting More on Willy T!!!,ginallorah,n/a,17/08/2025,"This was one of the most enjoyable documentaries that I've seen in quite a while. I highly recommend this movie and you don't have to be a racing fan to love it. I did not know of Willy T. until listening to Adam Carolla, and this doc was eye opening. It was an inspiration to me to what human perseverance can overcome. Hats off to Adam for spearheading this doc and sharing it with the world.",False
25,10,Fantastic Doc!,jcit-94292,n/a,17/08/2025,"Uppity is an extremely well made, fascinating documentary that you don't have to be a auto racing enthusiast to enjoy. Full disclosure: I'm a casual fan of motor sports because I grew up around with them. My father is a life long NASCAR fan and my oldest brother has raced on just about everything with two wheels and a motor. However, Uppity is about much more than racing. It's an inspiring and sometimes upsetting tale of true grit in the face of adversity, specifically deep seated racism. Give this doc the 10 minute test : I guarantee you'll be drawn in and end up watching the whole thing. By the way, I recommend it to my Dad and brother and they both watched and loved it. Give it a try and you will too!",False

1,6,Tragic,evening1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs viewed through this interesting documentary, Jodi had a great deal going for her.The ""beautiful, blonde bombshell"" came from a good family, and was artistically gifted and ambitious.After declaring on TV that ""no jury will
convict me -- I'm innocent,"" she was found guilty of the 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis. She narrowly escaped a death sentence, and today is serving life at Arizona's Perryville Prison.With input from legal, psychiatric, and law-enforcement experts, the documentary offers a backstory for the gory attack, which left 30-year-old Travis collapsed in his shower of stab and bullet wounds.Travis had had a difficult childhood, and he needed a woman ""to jump through hoops to prove to him how loveable he is,"" we're told. He'd done well for himself professionally by the time he and Jodi fatefully met at a Las Vegas business conference.Intense chemistry led to an on-and-off relationship. But eventually, Travis told Jodi, ""You are the worst thing that ever happened to me."" However, if she couldn't have him, no one could, we're told here.What a sad and regrettable waste!",True
2,1,Do not waste your time,shila-18970,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's one of the worst documentaries. Before anything, this documentary had nothing new to add to what other docs and tv shows already covered. The documentary had the worst experts, speakers, and guests. They invited a bunch of women who adored ""beautiful blonde"" Jody. Dear all, we are in 2023. Beautiful blonde does not automatically make one beautiful. In one point, one of Travis' relatives tells the audiences that Jodi was wearing glasses and wasn't beautiful blonds anymore. Well, she added in a mandatory voice that she was still beautiful.Further, the documentary sounded a bit victimblaming. Based on the doc, this woman did everything for this man, i.e. Changed her religion, accepted to have sex against her wishes, and moved for his convenience, yet Travis threw her away as soon as he found another person. Be careful of your narrative!Finally, why should they add that one-time verbal abuse and support the abusive behaviour? Abuse is unacceptable. But the case shows their relationship was anything but perfect. So, there was no need to focus on this issue.",False
3,3,Usual Doc from Tubitv,billcr12,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a voracious reader of true crime books but I have yet to read one on Jodi Arias. After watching this documentary, I am now interested enough in the woman to venture into one or more of the four that I have found.The problem here is, once again, repetitive reenactments and numerous interviews with podcasters; does anyone on earth not have one? The crime ""experts"" state their obvious observations, and in between, we see Ms. Arias being interviewed by a cop as she denies any knowledge of her on again, off again boyfriend's death.Jodi is certainly a damaged and compelling woman but I was bored by the unnecessary length of this film.",False
4,4,Husband watch,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOne of the things I had to learn when I got married was who was who in the true crime stories of not just the headlines, but going back for decades. My wife and her father used to watch these stories unfold in real time and had the same kind of language about them that I do about my obsessions like Jess Franco movies, Steve Ditko self-published Ayn Rand-inspired superheroes and mid-90s Japanese independent pro wrestling.Tubi gets their audience and while they have an Italian horror and giallo category for me, they also are producing true crime docs for my wife. Like Love You to Death: The Jodi Arias Story, which gets into the real story - as written by Savannah Lucas, who has worked on Snapped and Tubi's Suburban Nightmare: Jon Ben√©t Ramsey - of Jodi, her relationship with Travis Victor Alexander and how he ended up with a bullet in the head and 27 knife wounds.This was one of the first social media trials and this gets into everything, including how Jodi was selling artwork on eBay, which is pretty wild. Who wants that?Today, Arias is jailed at the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville in the medium security section. That hasn't stopped Lifetime from making Bad Behind Bars: Jodi Arias. This documentary does have several of the real officers involved in the case, as well as several bloggers and media people, all to give the full picture and generally, that picture is that Jodi was wrong and that every step of the way, they knew she was wrong and that she's still wrong.If you know true crime at the heights that my wife does, there's nothing new here for you. But for husbands who need to do some homework, well, this is pretty quick and you'll have something to talk to your wife about.",True

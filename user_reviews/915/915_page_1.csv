1,7,The director did a good job until he showed his bias,qqfbyyp,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSpoiler warning: Chin did a good job documenting the events of Aug 3 and I was pleased he showed ""possible routes and escape routes"" based on eye witness accounts and probability. He did an amazing job capturing the tight knit community El Paso is known for as well as capturing the feeling of the people who witness this tragedy. Enter his bias: He questioned the response time of the EPPD (fair question) but it felt like he kept trying hard to fault PD for not performing life saving measures. Speaking from hindsight it's easy to say the shooter wasn't there anymore and they could of allowed EMT to enter. He also made it a point to include clips of Trump talking about immigration. Although as an El Paso native I believe the unwanted spotlight did play a factor in this tragedy. At the time the left/right media was constantly covering the caravans coming to our city and the lack of resources we had for them. Chin chose to just mention Trump. He also posted a quote of the cowards manifesto stating he targeted Mexicans invading the country. He conveniently left out the part the coward also blamed the Republican Party for the ""invasion"". I wish he could of put his bias aside and tell the complete story.",True
2,1,If you had a chance to meet the director...,Moviesontherise58,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you ever meet Charlie Minn, never agree to get interviewed. He's quite intimidating and will go on and on with these questions, sometimes not even related to the situation itself. However, with this documentary, very unfortunate he jumped on the wagon right away with less than a year to interview and torture them with question after question. Geez Charlie! Leave them alone already, this tragedy is still fresh! Then of course attacking the first responders. I suggest waiting a couple years for an adequate documentary and unbiased opinion.",False
3,9,915,sylviatovar,n/a,15/08/2025,I thought Director Minn did a good job of chronicling the events of that tragic day in EP. It had several heartbreaking interviews from families with firsthand knowledge and accounts of the massacre. It was difficult to watch and relive but the documentary provided insight and historical social and cultural context of that alleged Hispanic invasion on that disastrous day.,False
4,1,Charlie Minn is a horrible director and person,irmamarie-937-495593,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was clearly just an exploitation of a horrific event and Charlie trying to bash first responders. I would love to know where he got some of the video and why he felt the need to show some of the scenes. How horrific for the families. Charlie obviously does not understand the meaning of sensitivity nor compassion. And let me be clear because it is obvious Charlie doesn't believe in honesty, the first responders did an EXCELLENT job with the chaos they were dealing with. People were calling in saying there were multiple shooters and there were shooters at the mall next door. I live in El Paso and remember this day very clearly. Thank God I watched this for free but I should sue Charlie for my wasted time.",False
5,1,This guy is lame,softpunk,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just give it up Charlie. You're not a good person, just a bottom feeder. Nobody appreciates you exploiting their communities to make your little ""movies"" dude. I remember you from college, the professors make students watch your documentaries for extra credit lol that's probably the only people that pay to see these half baked heavily biased documentaries. Isn't it already clear that you're really not that successful after 20 plus years? Move on already.",False
6,4,"Largely exploitive, amateur documentary.",argelius-10716,n/a,15/08/2025,"I do appreciate that this documentary actually shows (most of) the bloody reality of what happens during a masa shooting, things that are typically edited out. Having said that, it's hard to see this for anything more than it is - murder porn.",False
7,1,Horrible!,guerequechristy,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLet's begin with Minn's attack on EPPD.1: First unit arrived at the crime scene in 6 minutes. It's unfortunate to say that some people in El Paso, as I'm sure anywhere else, do not respect emergency units. An ambulance could be right behind them with lights & sirens on, & they will not move out of the way. . . Another detail, everyone in town was preparing for returning to school. There were a lot of people & traffic in that area that day. Therefore, the first officers arriving within 6 minutes was a hell of a good time!2: Minn's attack on EPPD for not rendering aid. It was not clear whether the shooter was still at the scene. Everyone was in shock. No one was able to give enough information to find him. Some people were saying there were multiple shooters; also still not confirmed at the time of law enforcement's arrival. Law enforcement must first stop the shooter(s) to prevent more individuals getting shot, including officers themselves.3: Minn's attack on EMT. Crime scene first needs to be cleared by law enforcement prior to EMT beginning to assist. EMT are not equipped with protective gear. Had the shooter(s) still been at the scene, first responders may have been victims themselves.Horrible questions to be asking the witnesses & victims! Asking one victim why she believed Crusius shot her if he was targeting Latinos? Asking another victim if she thought Crusius was sparing the kids? Asking another victim what he would say to the good samaritans? Asking another victim what he would've done differently to save his relative?Let me just end this review by saying Minn is definitely money hungry to be ""making a documentary"" so soon after the traumatizing event. Shame on you!",True
8,2,Insensitive Production,CharleyP-1,n/a,15/08/2025,I was pretty disappointed in the insensitive graphic nature of content here and why it would be allowed to share publicly with no respect to the victims. The heartless interviewing of survivors and witnesses was hard to watch. The reporting on speculations and rumors should have been spared. The exploitation of the survivors and fatal victims makes me even more sympathetic towards them after watching this guy ask so many unnecessary questions and make so many sloppy and amateur statements. Tip: stick to the facts and focus more on the survivors stories and less on the desperate shock value that you were obviously hoping to capitalize on here. Skip this one and find coverage of the massacre on a major network for a more polished and organized story and understanding.,False

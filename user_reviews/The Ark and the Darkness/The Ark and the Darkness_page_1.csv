1,5,"Misleading Description and Total Lack of Research, Yet Brilliantly Argued",jroneal-61099,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. I am just simply awestruck by this so-called documentary that I thought to be, from the description, a scientific collaboration of geologists and historians about the flood myth. I thought it was going to present varying views, as many research studies have been produced on the topic (combined with literary and oral traditions that span cultures and religions throughout the world) to show that there likely was in fact a major deluge at some time in human history in the Mediterranean world, which by the way was the known world at that time. It is so far removed from either in all aspects. I actually created an IMDB account just to comment.As a former Biblical Scholar with a degree from Yale University in this subject, the circular logic is astounding. Starting with the assumption that the Bible says as much and is therefore truth, followed by claims that use the Bible as the sole evidence for these arguments is just absurd. There is literally zero extra-biblical evidence or perspective in the film, nor is there any scientific research or counterfactual included whatsoever. It begins with the reasoning that the Bible says there was a flood. It then proceeds to use the Bible to confirm it's own null hypothesis...for those of you who are actual scientists or researchers.As someone who is both Christian and a historian of the Bible (don't get me started on that separate level of analysis alone in terms of historicity and interpretation), I find this film insulting to critical historians and Christian believers as well. It negates the value of biblical literature as one source of human history by asserting that a single document is the sole truth and account of humanity.I gave the film 5 starts out of 10 for a reason. I would have given a rating of 1 star. Based on it's deceitful marketing and nonsensical presentation. However, as a current lobbyist who argues for a living and spins webs of propaganda into debatable talking points, I am dumbfounded by the sheer brilliance of these ""researchers"" in the film. Just in complete awe. I have to respect that along with their dedication to perpetuating this mythos.As I stated above, as a former scholar of the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, I wholeheartedly believe their starting point is just blatantly missing the point of what these ""divine"" texts intend.We are not meant to interpret the Bible or any other holy text literally. Even the ancients, at their time of collectively writing the ""Bible"" that later became canonized texts (based on political reasons under the Roman Empire), did not take these accounts literally. Again, there is no space or time here to delve into so many details. But, current biblical apologists simply miss the point.Accounts of God, Heaven, miracles and so forth were not meant to be ""scientifically"" proven by modern-day believers. In my honest opinion, this dilutes the intended message that was understood even by the numerous original authors of the biblical texts. It just defeats the purpose. Faith is a completely different concept than proof. If evidence existed to humans of biblical accounts, faith would be irrelevant. Faith is what believers hold dear for the very fact that there is not proof. Attempting to prove biblical stories totally misses the point - both for us currently and for the ancients living in biblical times.I could write books on this topic, but I'll end here. For those who need to prove the Bible through supposed ""scientific research,"" I would question your own faith. The two are irreconcilable. For those who need proof, faith is nonexistent by definition. For those of us who question and rely on science, no amount of faith will ever suffice. I neither deny nor affirm any absolutes. I find solace personally in living in the realm between belief (or faith) and reason.",False
2,6,Good men misguided by distortion,dougbutner,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's quite a simple test to understand if somebody is a man of God. If somebody operates with love, and they can communicate their truth while accepting others truth, then they are like God, and they are one of gods people. Unfortunately, at least 2 of main narrators in this film are very much filled with hate, they are men of distraction and distortion.I personally am a believer in the flood, and I don't think that the Bible is a terrible account of it either. But trying to prove facts that have been distorted over thousands of years isn't helping their case.Given many other accounts which have surfaced, a better interpretation of the Bible in particular of the flood or that God in the Bible is aliens, you can quite literally replace the word God in the Bible with aliens and have a much more accurate account. They spend a lot of time talking about the lifespans of humans, well that's what happens when you have a race that lives 1000 years and they interbreed with a genetic stock here that lives much less time.There's no mention of carbon 14 dating, and it's quite a sad charade of trying to make a literal interpretation of the Bible seem plausible by pretending that the only arguments are the ones that they can attack.Overall, I enjoyed this film and watched it twice, I pray that the authors hear find love in their hearts as Jesus wants them to.",False
3,1,Mumbo jumbo with no fixed base in science,pugleon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is religious nonsense attempting to sound scientific. The ""Doctors"" interviewed are religious doctors. The science is garbage. And shame on the people who made the cgi to support this.This type of religious content carefully disguised as a real scientific documentary is dangerous. At best it's misleading and misinformation at worst it's damaging to the young and uneducated.It's so bad and so scientifically wrong they should have to put a warning label at the start.

4,3,Tedious,ca-apl,n/a,16/08/2025,"My wife and I went to see this on Thursday, March 21. The theater was literally full - there was perhaps one remaining seat. The subject matter was interesting but the presentation was difficult to sit through. The two most annoying things were 1) that the melodramatic background music literally never stopped, and 2) worse, the narrator was a horrible reader. His words were clear and appropriately emphasized, but the pronunciation of the word ""a"" as a long ""A"" and of ""the"" as ""thee"" began to grate pretty quickly, and he treated every word this way, including Michael Chrichton's last name (as a heavily emphasized ""Crike Ton"" sounding like two words). It's hard to explain, but you would understand what I mean if you tried to sit through it.Another irritation was the fact that they complained a lot about how scientists make fun of creationists, while they spoke in condescending tones and fake-laughed out loud on occasion when describing something they claimed that scientists believe (which was generally a drastic over-simplification of the facts).Bizarrely, the generated video would have us think that the main animals on Earth 4000 years ago were dinosaurs. They made sure that dinosaurs appeared in nearly every scene. I can't imagine their reason for doing this, but I've read that their Ark Encounter is obsessed with dinosaurs as well.Nevertheless, I heard some creationist arguments that I'd never heard before so it gave me some things to study. (I once believed in creationism myself, so I'm very interested in the subject.) One example is that of what are known as fossil trunks, upright fossil trees, or T0 assemblages, that the film refers to as ""polystrate fossils."" They claim that geologists cannot explain. (Unsurprisingly, geologists actually do understand this phenomenon.)We stayed until my wife, who is a Christian and believes in the flood of Noah, couldn't take it anymore due to the tedious and annoying production. There were about 15-20 minutes left at this point. The end seemed to be heading toward an appeal to believe in the god of Israel and the threat of eternal punishment, though I can't say for sure.",False
5,10,Not a fantasy. But actually fact.,toonarly,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most here give a bad review simply because they do not believe that a global flood occurred and that there is a God at all. This is where all of them come from. But there is ample evidence of a global flood by just listening to the dialogs in this documentary film. It's very well thought out and gives skeptics a real workout on how to refute it. Basically comes down to you either believe in God or not. Since even many atheists believe in a God whether not a personal one but just one that started everything goes to show that it's very very hard to explain all this evidence without one. Beautifully done, well explained and with a plethora of historical and archaeological evidence everywhere, you would have to just be ignorant to not see that something really big happened 4000 years ago and we are going to experience another very very soon. Nothing questionable, no nudity, or foul language, great for the whole family. Enjoy!!",False
6,1,"""Liberated from Religion"" and ""Wasting Time on God"", by Paulo Bittencourt",Freethinker_Atheist,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's just one of the many desperate attempts by followers of the Bible to ""prove"" that the myths written in that pile of copies of fragments of texts from the Iron Age found in a jar in a cave of a desert of the Middle East are true stories. Guess what: they are not (obviously). No matter how hard religious people try: There is no proof whatsoever that a global flood happened, let alone that a boat with samples of all the animal species from all continents - literally, how could that not be silly? - ever existed. Even Christians don't believe these stories anymore. The majority of Christians today think these stories are nothing more than allegories. The number of Christians who take the Bible literally is very small. I wonder why. ;-)",False
7,10,Great Documentry movie about Noah's Ark,aksuar,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The Ark and the Darkness"" is a riveting and thought-provoking documentary that delves into the fascinating story of Noah's Ark. The film takes viewers on a journey to the mountains of Turkey, where a team of explorers and archaeologists attempt to uncover the truth behind the biblical legend.With stunning cinematography and expert insights, the documentary masterfully weaves together history, science, and faith to create a compelling narrative that's both informative and entertaining. The film's attention to detail and commitment to authenticity make it a standout in the documentary genre.Through interviews with experts and eyewitness accounts, ""The Ark and the Darkness"" sheds new light on the age-old question: did Noah's Ark really exist? The documentary's unbiased approach and willingness to explore different perspectives make it a must-watch for anyone curious about the mysteries of the past.Overall, ""The Ark and the Darkness"" is a gripping and enlightening documentary that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats, eager to uncover the truth behind one of humanity's most enduring legends.

9,7,Good but not great.,mikepata2,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerObviously Christians will really like this documentary, and those who are not Christians will really not like it. The CGI is weak and lacking a professional touch, probably due to budget constraints. Many of the animations and still images appear as if they are under water, which really is unnecessary and bothersome.The information presented by various scientists from different disciplines is extraordinary. The scientific method is clearly used in all aspects to explain this catastrophic event that destroyed almost every living creature. How was the ark able to stay afloat during strong winds and high waves. It's explained by a mechanical engineer. Where did all the water come from and where did it go afterwards? That too is explained by science along with much more. The last 10 or 15 minutes are dedicated to ""witnessing"" to the non believers in the audience. I thought this was unnecessary.This documentary was put out by Christians for Christians. The skeptic will remain as such.",True

Doctors in the documentary are literally just part of why the world is a terrible place. They're accusing people of being nonbelievers, and they themselves believing all the, edited versions of the Bible and all these events that have been falsely communicated throughout history.Next time you wanna make a documentary, make it based on pure facts and science without having your niche biblical religious propaganda shoved into it.",False

I would strongly urge that people watch this movie for themselves in its entirety. Once you have watched the movie, perform your due diligence and conduct follow up research, investigation etc. For example, it is simple enough to research the various contributers, with respect to biographical data, institutional affiliation/membership, authorship of literature etc. Moreover, employ your critical faculties to evaluate the claims made in the movie prior to arriving at a conclusion.

15,1,Complete and utter fantasy,jedijeff-17243,n/a,16/08/2025,"Look - you can be as religious as you like. You have that right. But to claim the global flood actually happened is to ignore scientific facts. Not understanding radioactive decay rates doesn't mean you can ignore them. Being clueless on the formation of limestone does not give credence to your beliefs as facts.To accept anything mentioned in this ""documentary"" requires a complete disregard to natural facts that occur, and have occurred for billions of years. No, the Earth is not 6000 years old. No, man did not walk with dinosaurs. And no, the Earth was not globally flooded by water. Here's just a few minor facts you MUST brush aside to put truth into Noah's Ark:1) The mixing of fresh and salt water. Which type of fish, if either, survive? And then you need to have fresh water lakes reappear when the waters decline. Please explain how this works in reality.2) Two elephants residing for a year upon a boat, whose measurements are in your holy book, need to eat. The amount of food needed for just two elephants would take up 70% of the ark's interior. Where are the other animals going to sit? And their food? And the food for the carnivores?3) Eight people to protect, feed, clean up and care for at minimum 25k animals, but closer to 60k? In the real world we call that impossible.4) Nuclear decay generates heat. If you try and cram billions of years worth of decay into 365 days, you have a ton of heat to deal with. And I mean a ton. Want numbers? 1.68 * 10^30 Jules of energy. Want easier numbers? That amount of energy is equivalent to detonating over 780,000 1 ton nuclear bombs per square kilometer on the surface. Not the land mass but the entire surface of Earth. The water and the land is instantly vaporised when you are in that high a level of energy. And those numbers don't include the heat from impact events, plate movement and limestone formation, which when you add in almost quadruples the heat issue.Noah's Ark is a fairy tale not rooted in any form of reality. Watch this movie as a fun fantasy film and not a documentary.",False
16,10,Best comedy movie ever.,steveonetwo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Note I gave this movie a ten.That is because it is the funniest film ever made.Not even Laurel and Hardy or Charlie Chaplin could top it.And what makes this such a great comedy is the seriousness of the presenters. They appear actually to believe what they are saying ( A fantastic bout of acting on their part, Oscar worthy) the only fault I can find in this movie is the voice over is rather quiet and he does not appear to be convinced of what he is saying perhaps they used an AI here rather than a real person.Anyhow if your looking for satire you cant do worse than this movie.It's great.",False

18,9,Overall highly recommended. A wonderful documentary and a blessing to the world.,fitforfaith-ministries,n/a,16/08/2025,"A petition to those who are tempted to give 1 star, simply because they have heard the one fact that the movie is pushing back slow evolution: watch the thing. I have seen it over and over in the past years through my ministry, that those type of documentaries receive 10 stars or 1 star, with literally no spectrum in between. It is a matter of etiquette to watch & vote, or not to watch & -NOT- to vote.I give 9 stars, based on the following pros & cons:PROS+ Great production quality.+ Well investigated and clearly presented facts.+ Good selection of scholars, without the pseudo-critical injections sometimes found in other documentaries, while leaving the viewer puzzled which parts ought to be endorsed.+ One of the few documentaries which actually teaches the Good Message (towards the end, but with precision and love).+ Excellent argument that museums intentionally do not show e.g. Dinos & ducks together, and create a twisted and more dramatized version of the whole thing.+ It is also very important to point out that barely 40 years have passed since the new consensus had been established.CONSIt is probably not true that Eden was buried under hundreds of meters of material. The traditionally proposed Lower / Southern Mesopotamia lies barely at 34 meters ASL, while the Karaca Dag location in Upper Mesopotamia, discovered by Spire and this ministry in 2021, and also proposed by CMI some months later as landing site for the ark, lies still only at 498 meters ASL (plateau around the mountain; 1957 meters the mountain itself). 34 meters ASL do definitely exclude any additional layers and 498 meters do not provide much leverage. We often forget that everywhere material got added, elsewhere it needed to go. The flood stripped bare vast regions, while adding substantially to many other regions. I rather suspect by a look at the current condition, that Mesopotamia as a whole lost during the flood a significant substance (except the mountains which rose during and after the flood). Inspiration for another documentary.Usage of the later flood date which collides with the pyramids (2518/2348 BC versus the correct 3298 BC in the Greek OT) and 370 days duration versus the correct 360 days (equal to one year, see Rev 11:3, 13:5) provided in the Greek OT (from 27/02 until 27/02 = exactly one year, not from 17/02 until 27/02). A small detail, but a stumbling block for some unbelievers.I would have wished to see a little bit more on the abyss, e.g. To have a quick look at Ringwoodite, and to mention with some words the probable connection between the Pacific Ring of Fire (as localization for the underwater fissures) and the nearby Gran Canyon.Another very interesting point would have been the 2 great land bridges (Bering btw. Russia & US, 45 meters BSL; and Doggerland btw. Europe & GB, 35 meters BSL) which clearly existed until the flood.Overall highly recommended. A wonderful documentary and a blessing to the world.",False
19,3,Poppycock,terryapo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pronouncing that the global cataclysms and floods that occurred at 11,600 years in the younger dryas as judgement is hysterical flawed logic.

Then let's the anger build up like an abusive, drunken step parent until lashing out and destroying the world's entire population except for a chosen few?

I've always thought that, having been to a prehistoric clam bed a few hundred feet above sea level and prying loose a clam that I kept on my shelf through grade school.They poke so many mortal holes in evolution, you wonder why it even exists. Come up with something new, science! Every base was covered. How the dinosaurs are found, how they died, how they're piled up, how trees are found in multiple sediment layers. The only reason science doesn't embrace global catastrophic flood around 4500 years ago is because the bible already describes it.So the only problem with a great flood is that it's a religious tradition.

There was probably a 100-year flood, as there still are today. Perhaps even a bit more severe. Maybe an entire valley was flooded and only a shipbuilder with his family and a few animals survived. Or they were the only people who managed to get ashore on the western side of a large flood area. Over the years and centuries, the story became more and more exaggerated and the small valley that represented the world to its inhabitants became the whole world, a small stable of animals became two of each species and the trigger became an almighty being instead of heavy rainfall.I think there are more important things to put your passion into.

25,8,Good effort,dstealth-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTo be transparent, I am a Christian and subscribe to the biblical teaching on the origin of life. As another reviewer noted, those who believe this will love this documentary, and those who don't will hate it. I am giving it only 8 stars because the CGI could be smoother and more realistic and because of the music in some places. I was also disappointed that none of the flooding scenes ever showed the earth completely covered with water with just the dot of the Ark on the surface. I guess they were trying to keep it PG on the intensity level.Overall, this was good information. I follow some of the research of scientists who believe in intelligent design, so I've heard a fair amount of this evidence before, but I did learn something new, which was the aspect of the many languages created at the Tower of Babel and lack of just one language as a common ancestral tongue to the thousands of current languages.Though the gospel of Jesus and the need for His salvation are included in the last 15ish minutes, I would say that this film didn't come across well as a witnessing tool. For any Christians wanting to share this with evolutionists, God can still work, but it probably won't convince anyone to research more of the intelligent design information that seems to substantiate creation unless they're already open minded.",True

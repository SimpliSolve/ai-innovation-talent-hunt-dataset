1,8,Important,awvknj,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI think it would've added to this documentary to have included historical omissions, such as Einstein's wife, Mileva M Einstein who was not given any credit for the things that she collaborated on with him.. or what about Marie Curie, or Nancy Grace Roman, Jocelyn Bell Burnell, Margaret J. Geller to name a few.... This is an important documentary, and I think it should've laid a little bit more groundwork for the lack of recognition that has been given in addition to the ongoing, cultural biases, and what is being done to shift it. The tenacity of all the women covered in this documentary, as well as the ones omitted should be even more applauded given the negativity and literal oppression they received both in their work and as individuals who just wanted to study science.",True
2,9,A Documentary denouncement necessary...,RosanaBotafogo,n/a,16/08/2025,"In this documentary, women scientists discuss the inequalities they faced while creating a formula to make science accessible to everyone.A super painful documentary to watch, of course I know the challenges that women face in a world dominated by men and extremely sexist, however I could not even imagine how much humiliation, evil, all the horror they suffered within science and that many still suffer in other areas... A Documentary denouncement necessary, and a little justice for the women who suffered, disgusted that David Marchant, suffered a minima penalty, but very representative, resignation and loss of homage in the Marchant Glacier renamed Matataua Glacier that means ""a girl scout before the troops""...",False
3,10,Every man in academia has to watch rhis,asma-omid92,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the very first minute I started crying. It was like somebody else is telling me my story.Please make yourself aware of different type of harassment.Please don't ignore the harassment by saying: ""maybe it was a joke"", ""maybe you are too sensitive"", ""he doesn't mean it"".",False
4,10,"A very inspiring story, many very inspiring scientists",slowpoke123,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a female person-of-color undergrad who aspires to pursue physics research, I have personally experienced many put-downs due to my gender.I have always deeply admired those female scientists coming before me, for their unwavering courage and determination.",False
5,10,"a must see, for scientific students -- as well as all teachers and academic staff",artiszt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Without taking sides -- if there really would be a choice even imagining such choice -- the documentary describes. It doesn't quite tell, speak or attempt to communicate some events, personal stories of all injustice on all levels, dimensions and scales in academia, in the USA -- btw when having watched it, there's no need to detail it's the same in Europe, Asia, wherever. That became implicity obvious. And that itself is reason to argue why this documentary is excellent.Those interest in science, getting thins done in the field of academia better watch it before setting foot on any univiersity campus. Not because the academia universe is worse than other worldly universes, the arts for instance, or so. No. Coz the same applies to the arts. Probably, well, most likely, to sports too.But in academia, one did assume for way too long neglecting strong evidence, it can't happen given most people assuemd in that field are bright, least intelligent to some extent.But it's not about intelligence. And that's what the documentary tells w/out telling because all it does is : it describes. As a matter of fact, it just reports. W/out taking sides as if there really would be a choice even imagining such choice ..",False
6,10,An eye-opening view of what women in male dominated academia have had to put up with!,franceshugg777,n/a,16/08/2025,"One would think that the very educated men in academia would be above acting like 13 year old bullies, but one would be wrong there. So glad that David Marchaunt was finally fired by Boston University, no man deserved it more! What these smart women have had to put up with for all of their careers is just so wrong! As a graduate student working on my Master in European History at Duquesne University in the 1970s, no one ever tried this crap on me, but then I was already married to a 6 foot 4 inch 200 pound recently ex- Air Force sergeant with very impressive muscles. Or maybe it was because it was a Catholic school, or perhaps history is not just primarily a male find. But no woman should have to put up with this sort of thing! That full professors in science at major universities have had to for many decades just show how very fragile men's egos are, that they can be so threatened by smart women in their fields. Their behavior is disgusting! Past time this horrible behavior was exposed!",False
7,6,Harassment,121mcv,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unfortunately harassment is ubiquitous, it would appear it is rampant in a male dominated world, while its not surprising it is sad.",False
8,2,Very Disappointing,xorten-79311,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI had simple expectations before watching the documentary. I expected to learn that there are policies that discriminated against women. An example of a policy is affirmative action, that discriminated against certain races - and I expected that this documentary to expose such a discrimination policy against women. This did not happen and anecdotal evidence of bullying or being treated like garbage does not count (men get bullied and treated like garbage too). The fact that less girls are interested in science than boys has not been mentioned.We get statistics on there being less women in some field where there's no 50/50 split between men and women. This is clearly a problem! Might as well go after the plumbers, electricians, construction workers, and any other field where there's not a 50/50 split.There's a story about one woman parking in the faculty parking lot and someone asking if she worked there. The woman was also mistaken for a janitor.There's a story about some random dude asking out a bunch of women and kept getting rejected. I am not sure what point they were trying to get across.There's a story about there being few women engineering students left at the senior year, as compared to many women during the freshman year. I remember my engineering classes. During freshman year, maybe 1 in 20 students was a girl, and no one was telling the girls to leave.There's a story about guys wanting to have beer with a woman, then another guy assuming her success came from having a beer and sleeping with them.There's a story about a woman getting little lab space. I am certain this happened to men as well.The left/right association test was an absolute joke.The most heartbreaking story is the guy at Antartica bullying a woman and endangering her life and health. She should have sued the guy and the program.A few great quotes from the documentary:
""A ton of feathers is still a ton.""
""If you don't have women, you lost half the best people.""
""The higher you go up the ivory tower, the whiter it gets, and the more male, and the more hetero.""Is it sad to hear these stories? Yes. Am I a bad person because I am not convinced that every woman that wants to be a scientist or engineer needs to jump through special hoops and battle all the evil men to do so? No.",True
9,n/a,Informative and Inspiring,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I liked the structure of the documentary. We get a definition of the problem, first-hand experiences, discussions about where the problem comes from, examples of how women have managed to create lasting change, and reasons why we should all care. Overall, it presents a good basis for discussion/action, regardless on how familiar you are with the topic.Also, the protagonists are truly inspiring. Especially when they share their thoughts on how they navigate and respond to inappropriate behavior on a daily basis. As a white male, I have never had to think about these things - and I completely agree with some of the statements in the documentary: It is a complete waste of brilliant minds.Because it is US-centric, it prompts me to look at how things are elsewhere. I hope to find at least progress.",False

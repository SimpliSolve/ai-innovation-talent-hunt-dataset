1,10,Best documentary of 2023,shayeraisley,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary provides a raw perspective on the Romanian family life and issues. Even so, I feel like people from many other cultures could empathize as well.The way it was filmed and the fact that it covers almost two decades add to the authenticity of the story, and they make it much more intense.I have never laughed so hard and cried so unexpectedly during the same movie as this time, so it definitely took me by surprise. Somehow, I expected it to be much lighter from the trailer.I'm truly in awe of how good this documentary is and I really hope it gets the recognition it deserves. There is no downside to it.",False
2,8,Family Complexities,tributarystu,n/a,16/08/2025,"Capturing family dynamics on film is a formidable task, as it involves eliciting authentic emotions and interactions without the subjects censoring themselves. Eugene Buica's documentary, which spans many years but focuses on episodic moments, successfully navigates this challenge. The film portrays a raw and unfiltered view of his family, encompassing humor, grim realities, and deep sadness.The story begins in 1998 with Mr. And Mrs. Buica returning to Romania from the United States for their son George's wedding, while their other son, Eugene, documents the event. To be fair, the story really begins decades earlier, with the couple living in communist Romania, and we piece it all together as we watch along.During the wedding trip, the interactions between Mr. And Mrs. Buica quickly escalate from playful jabs to toxic exchanges, with accusations of infidelity and dismissals as mere exaggerations. This dynamic persists throughout the film, blending light-hearted and empathetic scenes with more daunting and uncomfortable moments.The documentary offers a rich tapestry of human nature, challenging moral judgements. The mismatched yet enduring relationship we are presented with raises complex questions and not all find an answer. Eugene's dual role as a documentarian and a son adds depth, highlighting the generational perpetuation of dysfunction and trauma.Ultimately, the documentary explores the fragmentation of the human soul and the thin line between interpersonal exploitation and genuine storytelling, making it a compelling and thought-provoking family saga.",False

1,8,They've made physical therapy look good !,PaulusLoZebra,n/a,15/08/2025,"Federico Chiesa is an exciting player for Juventus and Italy who lost 18 months of his career from a nasty knee injury. This is his story, from the day of the injury to his first time back in an official match. The filmmakers have made this into an interesting story by adding many real-life elements - family, childhood, love life - into the calendar structure dictated by his recovery, physical therapy and training. It works. Chiesa comes across as a genuine, kind and outgoing family guy with some vulnerabilities and fears related to his injury. The film is a pleasure to watch because the location of each scene is announced with beautiful shots of the places, and many nice shots of the Alps and the Apennines. It's also a great insight into the arduous, detailed and scientific way that elite athletes are brought back from injury.",False

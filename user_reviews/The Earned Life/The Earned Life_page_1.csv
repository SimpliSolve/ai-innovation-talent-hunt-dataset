1,10,"The Earned Life, indeed earned its impact to those lives touched by Marshall.",zenglochen,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Earned Life, indeed earned its impact to those lives touched by Marshall. It depicted a wonderful life journey about Marshall's work and life. Marshall is not only the #1 leadership thinker and executive coach, but also a fine human being who made those in touch of him a better version of self at work as well as at home! Modeling the way: Marshall's courage to be authentic, to be vulnerable, and to be funny, at the same time, so courageous and bold to tell uncomfortable truth and show the needed tough-love are just an amazing mix. What a smiling Buddha with a loving heart and wisdom in work and life! Thank you.",False
2,10,The Earned Life - Be inspired to become who you might be,omaravankin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Marshall Goldsmith has been an inspiration for so many in the leadership and coaching world. ""The Earned Life"" captures beautifully a man who came from a modest background to become a key thought leader and an influencer, who made a positive impact in many people's lives. Some of the concepts that Marshall developed are very powerful in getting people to change actual behaviors - not just wishes and intentions. Marshall's generosity has inspired so many to ""pay-it-forward."" He is immensely wise, has a self-deprecating humor, a contagious laugh, and boundless energy. Thoughtful and honest, he helps us become a better version of ourselves. This is an inspirational movie about a man living his philosophy and living a life worth living.",False
3,10,Inspiring legacy of lasting impact,groberts-09640,n/a,16/08/2025,"Marshall Goldsmith has long provided inspiration for hundreds of thousands of coaches, leaders and talent practitioners globally. The Earned Life provides a wonderful view into the life's work of one of coaching's most prominent and generous thought leaders. Featuring real stories and experiences from a wide cross section of people whose lives have been changed as a result of Marshall's methods and teachings, The Earned Life is both inspirational and educational in equal measure. Life is good and this movie provides a window into how to live that good life even more fully. Wonderful viewing for all interested in how to move from theory to practice and those curious to explore the many benefits that coaching can provide.",False
4,3,Disappointing. Marshall Goldsmith should have earned a better documentary,bollenschuur,n/a,16/08/2025,"Marshall Goldsmith deserves alot of respect for how he has pioneered performance improvement coaching with his Stakeholder Centred Coaching. He has built an industry around his unique methodology. His books are great and worth reading. He coined the phrase ""what got you here won't get you there"" by which he inspired millions aspiring to grow as a leader. Therefore I had great expectations for this film. The Earned Life however is not much more than a lengthy infomercial, filled with old stories and platitudes. With his track record he has indeed an ""Earned Life"" and he would have earned a really good documentary too. This one lacks any depth or new insights. No critical questions are asked. Nothing about the challenges he must also have come across as a coach; how he has helped his clients move beyond their doubts and issues. He is portrayed as a motivational speaker, not a coach. It feels rather inconsistent to watch someone being worshipped (and visibly enjoiyng it) who teaches us that humility is a key leadership quality.",False
5,10,Earn your life every day,andreasjaffke,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yesterday is over, who knows if we are here tomorrow. Only what you do in the present really counts as that is the only moment you can act to change for a better. ""Life is good"" could have bern the title of this movie as it transmit the only urgency that truly matters: Carpe diem and do it with a positive attitude. Always. A great documentary with many great people conveying important messages to the spectator any leader and leader to be should watch.",False
6,10,Powerful lessons on being a better leader AND being a better human being,srikumarsrao-22909,n/a,16/08/2025,I have known Marshall Goldsmith for two decades and he has been friend and mentor throughout.In this next phase of his life - perhaps the last - he is still breaking new ground and opening new paths. How many persons would cap his significant achievements in the world of coaching by freely giving away decades of proprietary material developed so painstakingly?But the rational is simple if unusual. Marshall wants to continue to have impact. And he figures the best way for him to continue to have impact is to help those he trusts and respects to better serve their clients.And this is not an ego trip. He does look for attribution and its OK if you do not mention him.What i guy!The Earned Life is more than a biography of an unusual teacher. It is also an encapsulation of some of his more powerful teachings.The biggest takeaway for me - I learnt this from him long ago but the movie reinforced it - is that it is never about you. The best way to become a great coach is to work with great clients.Amen!,False
7,10,Very Impressed,michaelbeale-80560,n/a,16/08/2025,"Marshall is at his best!Enjoyable to watch, great tips for leaders and coaches to succeed.",False
8,10,Legacy of Leadership Coach Marshall Goldsmith,maheshtriv,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really very inspiring documentary with four qualities.of successful leaders. They are courage,humility, discipline and adaptability. The biggest inspiration punchline message of Marshall Goldsmith for me is, If you have a dream, follow that dream. It is your life. Follow Your Dream is a captivating and deeply inspiring message that celebrates the extraordinary journey of Coach Marshall Goldsmith. Through its poignant storytelling and powerful message, the film serves as a testament to the indomitable human spirit and the profound impact one individual can have when they dare to follow their dreams. Mahesh Trivedi from Sydney.",False
9,10,Watch and Be Inspired,daviscornelia,n/a,16/08/2025,"I must confess that Marshall Goldsmith was a new entity for me. The themes of his leadership center on courage, humility, discipline, and adaptability came out strongly in the documentary. I will be searching out his books and will be suggesting them to my non-fiction book club to read and discuss.As I reflect on the current state of chaos in the world caused by a so-called leader of the free world, I see that our US leaders severely lack courage and humility. The underlying problem is that they don't realize they need coaching to make themselves better leaders. This documentary should be mandatory for politicians to watch and implement.",False
10,10,Adding Value and touching the points,alkhaja-08300,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie added many values by clarifying and reminding me of many points that I got busy and not seeing as before, it helps me to open the points again and re write my values and put them on the board to remember everyday.",False

12,10,What do you do when you reach the top? Give away the roadmap!,davdavila,n/a,16/08/2025,"Marshall has impacted countless lives, including my own. His work has helped me grow, not only in my career as a leadership development coach, but also as a human being. Like a good leader, he focuses on what matters, and like a good buddhist, to let go of what doesn't. He'll smack you on the head with wisdom with a carefree smile on his face! He's been rated the #1 CEO coach in the world, has countless books, and has more airline miles than he knows what to do with. Most people would be happy to sit on that wealth of experience and continue monetizing it. He chooses to give it away freely - and asking that we do the same.You don't have to believe me. Watch the movie, and if you learn anything from it, simply pass it on to your friends and family.",False
13,10,The True Meaning of Life Fulfillment,mdw-57013,n/a,16/08/2025,Helping others to help themselves is a great goal in life. Marshall Goldsmith shares his philosophy and joy at being an inspiration to others.,False
14,10,The Servant Leader,peter-162-298096,n/a,16/08/2025,"Marshal Goldsmiith's movie is an excellent explanation of the power of a facilitative style of leadership. It is revolutionary and unique approach which, in my view, recognises the perfection of both leader and co-worker. The leader is always a learner leader who never knows it all. Such a leader is open and responsive to new ideas and even brutal feedback on his way of doing things. Goldsmith's type of leader is not a boss. He understands that the progress of his company depends upon getting the best out of the whole team. Those who care are the best kind of facilitator leader. They lead by example. His own humble yet humorous way of presenting himself, puts Marshall Goldsmith as a living example of his Buddhist philosophy. A wonderful and enlightening movie.",False
15,10,Impactful Earned Life,vijaymkulkarni,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every time I hear Marshal, he always inspires me. This movie taught me few important lessons authentic, vulnerable and be courageous with having constant fun. Be bold what you believe.

Learning from coachee as well as mentee of Marshal is also added value.",False
16,10,The Earned Life will inspire you to live your best life,homairak,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Earned Life is beautiful in both the simplicity of what a good life is all about, and the depth of its message: it's a blessing to be alive-give it the best you got. Marshall Goldsmith's life is a lived version of his message. He lives by the 4 tenets of an earned life, and if you've ever interacted with him personally, you know that you cannot forget his humility and the way he makes people feel. Watch the movie to feel inspired, to laugh, to lighten up, and to step away from the noise of the world and reconnect to what's important to you- and then to know how to pursue it with passion and joy.",False
17,10,Makes me want to be better,sal-65296,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've followed Marshall's work for a long time. The Earned Life brought many of his teachings together in one engaging venue. More importantly, it's an inspiring story that makes me want to be better, live healthier, and make a more significant contribution.

Thanks to Marshall and the cast for putting this together.",False

19,10,The gift of going inside the mind and heart of a master coach!,suarezexecutivecoach,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was expecting a movie about Marshall's life, and I got it. What surprise me most was the unexpected gift to have him mentor me coach to coach, through this movie. I plan to go watch this movie again to listen to his words, pauses, body language, reflect on his learnings and to think about his experiences. What he is telling you thru the movie is a life journey full of ""aha"" moments that you can use as stones to step on and get further. Felt deeply touch when he mentioned this is a way to leave a legacy to younger generation of coaches, so we use what we learn from Marshall to change the world, one person at a time. And this is too my life journey. Happy to learn we are walking together from different places and at different stages, but in the same path. God bless Marshall and his wife, his family, and all that participated in this movie including the production crew. Watch this movie if you want to be inspired to change the world thru your thoughts, feelings and actions, and the impact you cause in others like a ripple effect.",True
20,10,Excellence and humility are a powerful combination,nolasimon,n/a,16/08/2025,"I came across Marshall's work last week and read one of his books so this was interesting timing. The movie really highlights the generous, humble approach to coaching. I love that Marshall's focus is now on his legacy and impact. Sharing his intellectual property to benefit others is so cool. Creating the MG100 to create community among world-leading coaches so it has bigger impact was the start of this process. Really fascinated with the daily six questions and feed forward.

25,10,Goes by in a Flash,labriepeter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Marshall Goldsmith goes through the fundamentals of his leadership approach, with four building blocks (courage, humility, discipline, and adaptability). Each theme is supported by examples, and comments from the past.For all that, he takes time to get some guidance, along the way, from his personal assistant. That humanizes the documentary.I like his reflections on people from his life that inspired his journey. He is funny, insightful, and entertaining, all at once. His stuff works, but he is the product, too.It is nice to see him share the stage with many of his top clients and coaches. Goldsmith is a positive change catalyst. It is easy to see why he attracts so many CEO-level supporters.",False

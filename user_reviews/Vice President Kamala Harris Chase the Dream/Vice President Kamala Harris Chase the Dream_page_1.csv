1,10,"Short, good and informative. Enjoyed it.",boothjenson,n/a,16/08/2025,I wanted to learn more about Kamala Harris so I looked around to see what was streaming and found this. I found this to be very informative and good. I think Kamala has great conviction and takes a great stance on many good issues. She also apologizes when things that had good intentions don't turn out so good. Not many politicians will admit mistakes. This really covered a lot of good issues and I'm excited to vote for her in November. She has good presence and carries herself very well. She is for the people and it shows through her work. She has spent her career trying to make things better.,False
2,10,"Well-made, good brief overview of Kamala Harris. Liked it",ulka-03371,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well-made. Good brief overview of who Kamala Harris is, what has been important to her all her life and through her career. We unexpectedly came across this documentary on a streaming platform. Ended up watching the entire thing before we knew it, because it's short and reasonably fast-moving. We liked the simple down-to-earth documentary. It was probably made during her 2020 campaign and released right after she became the vice-president. But watching in 2024, it feels timely. Because it does capture the essence of VP Kamala Harris and even 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris pretty well.",False

1,8,Incredible! With an important message.,DLochner,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Nepalese shows it to the world. Anyone who goes mountaineering themselves can certainly assess the enormous performance of the man a bit better than a layman. Nevertheless, it should be said that great things have been achieved here. And the film shows that too. Perhaps he cannot match the emotional strength of Jimmy Chin with his film Free Solo, but it has an important message in it: Sherpas are the real heroes of the mountains, without them many of the western mountaineers would not be able to climb all the 8,000-meter peaks. Nirmal Purja, a little hero.",False
2,9,Incredible Doc - One of the Best Ever,anthonydapiii,n/a,16/08/2025,"""From the beginning of our life, we are approaching death.""14 peaks had me in awe. It was beyond a great documentary and an incredible feat.The amount that Nims went through can tell stories for what seems like the lifetimes of 2 people. Endeavor after endeavor, mountain after mountain, and it brought with it unforeseen difficulties. Nims and his team climbed more than 8000 m+ peaks. They climbed mountains within their mind, body, and soul.I hope him and his team get more recognition and credit. Wow!I hope this crew gets recognition for such a beautiful documentary that assembled for the world.Project possible shows what's possible - especially with belief. Nims inspired me now that I'm going on to climb my own mountains in life (literally and figuratively;)).",False
3,7,Riveting and inspiring documentary--almost too much to take in,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"""14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible"" (2021 release; 101 min.) is a documentary about a Nepal mountaineer's seemingly impossible attempt to summit the earth's 14 mountains that are higher than 8000 meters, all in a single season (April through October, 2019). ""Don't be afraid to dream big"", reflects Nirmal Purja, the man at issue. We then go back in time as we learn of Purja's modest upbringing and his eventual joining of the UK Special Forces. Along the way we are also introduced to Purja's family, non more so than his now-ailing mother, who looms over the family's history. At this point we are 10 min into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from Torquil Jones. Here he is given unfettered access to the large-than-life, almost dare-devilish, dream of Pruja to do what nobody has ever tried before. To put in perspective, talking head Jimmy Chin reminds us that an expedition to summit one of these mountains typically takes 2 months. Here Purja is going to summit the world's 14 highest mountains in just over 6 months... Just crazy, right? Along the way, we are treated to some out of this world footage about these mountains.""14 Peaks"" started streaming on Netflix a week or so ago. I caught it the other night, and I was amazed how quickly time flew by as I was watching this. If you have any interest in extreme sports, or in simply an awe-inspiring slice of life in general, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,10,Stick your superhero movies up your......,radhrh,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nimsdai (Nims ) Purja was born poor in Nepal. He joined the British army Ghurka regiment where he served for six years before joining the elite SBS where he served a further ten years. That would be plenty for most, but not Nims. After his first mountaineering experience in 2014 he decided to climb 14 of the World's highest and most dangerous peaks. This feat had been achieved before but took eight years to complete. Nims Purja attempted it in 7 months! A single climbing season.This astounding attempt is documented in this one of a kind movie. Of course the scenery is spectacular but it's eclipsed by the bravery and good hearted dynamism of Nimsdai (Nims ) Purja, a real life superhero.",False
5,10,just awesome and inspiring,khadkas-91629,n/a,16/08/2025,"Utterly awe-inspiring and a reminder of how so many people are ignored and taken for granted.Be like nimsdai and know you are magic, magnificent and capable of even more than you dared dream.",False
6,7,Unbelievable achievement but poor movie adaption,philiptaufenbach,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI dont want to Talk down their accomplishments, which are truly beyond the world.But all in all i have a Problem with how the movie was Made. I hoped there would be storylines about the single mountains they climbed, Like how many Camps it has, Routes, death rate, height and a good documentation about their ascend. But there were almost No Details what so ever. You See that they arrived and in the next Scene they are already Like halfway through the ascend with No mentioning which Route they Took and how high they already were, which was pretty dissapointing to someone, who also wanted to learn about the beautiful Mountains. I know it ist pretty difficult to do have all These Details i mentioned earlier in a movie but at some parts i had a Feeling of wasted time by telling unnessecary Long Story lines Like those with These rescues. Not that i didnt want to See anything of These rescue, which were also pretty interesting to watch, but These Stories were partially longer than some ascends to a mountain!At the end the biggest question in my head was: why die they Not Made a series Out of it? Each Episode one or two Mountains or at least each EP one Project step so you have 3 Episodes in total. You couldve Seen and learn so much more about their astonishing Performance. And If im Being honest, i could watch them all day with those beatiful Made recordings.Still a good movie to watch for the incredible recordings, music and a little insight into the Project, but for it failed to gained its full potential.",True
7,8,High achievers,brockfal,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love films about people taking on great challenges, but this is something else! Gurka Nimsdai Purja and his team of four scale the 14 highest mountains over 8000m, and in just 7 months. Spectacular in every way, it's quite a ride, and though there isn't much time to dwell on the details of climbing the individual mountains so it all feels a bit rushed at times (14 mountains in 110 mins) the film still gives overviews which are illustrated well. You wonder what they'll top this achievement with!!",False
8,n/a,great movie,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this movie. It took so much determination, courage and focus on climbing all the higher mountains. This is absolutely a must watch movie/ documentary. The view from the summits is totally incredible.",False
9,7,Nice but pretentious,xNecRosex,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a great achievement but very little went into technicals, and how things were actually planned and done. A lot of time it's just trying to be something it's not, it's trying too hard to feel mesmerising and showcase everything in a fancy fashion.The ego and self-flattery is absolutely enormous. Could use more humility.There is literally 2-3 seconds of footage from some of the peaks, then minutes of Nims bragging around.I do get that nobody's done that before but holy hell we could have learnt something about mountaineering and climbing rather than watching him brag about how OverPowered he was born.",False
10,9,you dont have to be a climber to love this,backnblack-06123,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was amazing and one of the best I've seen, his a intelligent man with amazing DNA that none of us have his wife is a complete angel for allowing him this freedom to live his dreams
If you like this and you will the doc on Fred Becky is slightly better its available on amazon for a price i think a one day rental was $1.",False
11,7,An incredible ego-trip,fredrik-46815,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spectacular movie, of course. Beautiful production and plot.However, the main character started out being humble and speaking for the Nepalese people. Then it was all about him, and that he is the best human being ever.Me, me, me. Insisting he did it for the human kind. This record does not move the world in the right direction, it is in the end just about his selfish need to be better than everyone else.",False
12,9,Deserves a mini series,shashwatblack,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was an amazing watch. Loved the thrill, the incredible shots, the inspiring story, all of it.But some mountains did feel a bit rushed. Yeah, he climbed all three mountains in 4 days, but there must have been unique challenges in each one. I wish they'd spent more time on that.",False
13,6,Too much self promoting,vreka-31474,n/a,16/08/2025,"We had high expectations and watched the doc the day it was released.However...although the film was beautifully shot it did not get a grip on us. The story, how heroic it initially looked, was real shallow with few attention for the Sherpas who are so very necessary to make the expedition a success.Nirmal Purja get all the attention and him being a hero has been mentioned so many times that it starts to annoy the viewer.Therefore mixed feelings here. Would have loved to give it a higher rating but must be honest, not a top notch doc to watch.",False
14,5,"Too fast, moments not captured",austin-19993,n/a,16/08/2025,"Was waiting for this since a year, was searching all over youtube for his documentary. When it was finally here, they could have captures the moments and the journey properly. Less then 2 hrs for such once in a life time achievement, its like they show him at the base camp, then in the middle somewhere and then the summit with the date. What about the challenges, difficulties, the whole story about each mountain, and the joy of reaching the summit, how he gathered funds initially. The 3rd phase especially got over even before it started. Such nice photography and pictures but somewhere theres a feeling of incompleteness. You could watch some of the non-netflix youtube videos and how they have captured all the important things.So many useless shows get a whole series of 10-20 episodes. They could have atleast had 14 - 1 for each mountain. May be a chance lost, may be not everyone would have liked a long series but the real adventure guys would have loved the detailing. It xoukd have been like the bible of 14 8000ers.",False
15,10,Mind blowing.,rahuldasbabon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMind blowing, hats off to the team. Thanks Netflix for showcasing such amazing talent. He really showed what a human being is capable of. Such an inspiration for many climbers.",True

14 Peaks: Nothing is Impossible.What a terrific story, what an achievement !👏👏",False
17,6,Mountaineering documentary without that much mountaineering,leonffe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThey had this amazing idea to film a man climbing to 14 tallest mountains on Earth. Instead they mostly that man's motivations and background. The climbing segments were extremly short and didn't give an idea what it was like climbing on all of those mountains. Most of their names flashed on the screen for short time and then we see a couple second shot from the peak. It seemed like Everest had longest about climbing/peak because it is the most well known mountain. If they didn't want to show that much climbing, they could've just give us short 3d animation about the climbs path. I would've also liked at least one scene of them setting up a camp.Also what happend to the first climber saved from the mountain? Did he survive?",True
18,10,One of the best ever. Legend,rupak369,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nims Purja is a legend. This documentary deserves all the praise, respect and liking. From the cinematography to the shots, everything was flawless. The journey showcased is out of this world. Wish him more power. Project Possible.",False
19,6,Watch The Alpinist instead.....please.,wigl301,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great accomplishment spoilt by over dramatisation and self indulgence. The main character starts as a very positive and outgoing person but becomes a egomaniacal self centred person. All the drama about his mum being ill? If your mum was ill, would you be taking the cameras with you every time you went to see her, even in the hospital?I think most climbers don't care what other people think of them - they climb because they love the thrill of climbing. This movie was far more of an ego trip for the protagonist.If you want to see an outgoing and beautiful movie with far more challenging and crazy climbs with unbelievable scenery and a much more grounded protagonist, please watch The Alpinist! It's honestly a much better film.",False
20,10,Superhuman,phillpdodds,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've followed Nims' journey on social media for a while so I was expecting something pretty special from this documentary. I'm massively understating it by saying I wasn't disappointed. Nims and his team are nothing short of superhuman. The documentary itself is beautifully presented. Inspiring and emotive. The feat is incredible and downright ridiculous to even consider possible (I mean, who thinks about climbing 3 x 8000m+ peaks in 48 hours?!?!) But the special bond Nims has with his native Nepal and the awareness he brings to viewers as to the special nature of its climbing community is just beautiful. Add to that the film's presentation of the obvious love, pride and respect of his family and it all makes for a very special documentary that pushes the boundaries of what the human body and mind are capable of. He says he'll be back with something bigger next time...how is that even possible?? Well for Nims I guess ""nothing is impossible.""",False
21,7,"A great documentary, which yet was too plain",jennniindia,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed watching this documentary.Not to mention scenic views at eight-thousanders, two stories of a collective mission on climbing top peaks and Nims' personal struggle (to find himself?) were inspiring together. In particular, the second part was rich, blending well the different angles taken by Nims' wife, mother, and brother on Nims and his risky, ambitious, and meaningful project.But there seems to be something missing in the mountaineering part. Although delightful and well-edited (maybe too edited?), the documentary does not effectively share ""real"" stuggles, tensions, joys the team might have faced in nailing each top with audience. GoPro clips (cruder less edited) on climbing Annapurna would be much more mindblowing and engrossing.I appreciate that this documentary has helped putting Sherpas more in the due spotlight. But I wished I could see more of their characters and voices in the documentary. Although it says that Sherpas matter as core members in the climbing community, it depicts Nims as a super hero like leader and Sherpas as their typical supporting roles.",False
22,10,"Masterpiece, legend.",kinkyswarley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, what an inspiration and drive for any human on earth, mesmerising journey in every sense of the word, Nim is truly a legend, also completely nuts, but a legend as well. Great directing and producing also.",False
23,7,"A superb, inspiring, and informative documentary on a local hero...",SumanShakya,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Nepali mountaineer sets a record by climbing 14 highest mountains of the world inlcuding 8 mountains in Nepal, 5 in Pakistan, and one in Tibet, all above 8000m, in 6 months, which is just superbly documented in this film though the expedition hasn't earned much of accolades in the media. Perhaps limited to the news archive, the film delves into the hardship of mountaineering, including the high risks it poses. It's a homage to the inevitable the mountaineers go for the mankind. Apart this. It photographs the summit of the highest mountains through the lenses seldom seen in the movies.It's not a thriller or a drama with the last minute twists but it's a testimony of the nature captured at its best with the real life footages. However, the defects if any are the film feels a raw documentation and a feel good features of a mountaineer and his family. Many ascents to the mountains are covered very briefly and doesn't disclose the hardships related to the each of the cases. The film is overall informative like the amusing news of the traffic jam encountered during the ascent of Mt. Everest or China barring the climbing of Shishapangma which was lifted off following the pressure on the government, but still the audiences feel much is left in this documentary regarding the mountaineering. Though it's the story of a Nepali mountaineer, it's made by a western documentary maker. Just wondered why a Nepali film-maker didn't venture to tell the story of their countryman.Rating: 2 stars out of 4.",False
24,4,"I review the documentary, not the project",gcarpiceci,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let's get this clear upfront: I am reviewing the documentary here, not the endeavour nor its protagonist - they both have my deepest respect and admiration.Now, the documentary: it's actually bad, pretty bad, brother. I am junkie of mountaineering books and movies and I think I've seen the good, the bad and the ugly of it. 14 Peaks rates rather low for the simple reason that there is very little mountaineering and climbing in it and the very little that is there is not made very interesting.The documentary ends up being a long pep talk, a lot of philosophising (some of it a little cheap) and quite a bit of self promotion.So, yeah, brother...chapeau to the project but as for the movie, try harder...",False
25,10,Wholesome and inspiring: Nirmal Purja,ravenclaw_girlrules,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is completely wholesome - I can't get enough of these mountain climbing docus.The 'protagonist' Nirmal Purja is so friendly and humble the whole time. He loves his culture, his mother, his girlfriend, and his sport. It really makes you cheer for his success.",False

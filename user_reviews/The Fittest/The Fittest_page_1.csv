1,8,Just...Incredible,crossfitchaves,n/a,16/08/2025,Best motivational movie ever watched. And this is only the competitive part of CrossFit. And is beautifull. But CrossFit is 10% about competition. What would be amazing is to see the other 90%. The saving lives part. Scenes with older people or with physical and health difficulties to overcome. The transforming lifes part. That an inspiration to everyone.,False
2,8,A solid documentary for a questionable competition year,hollywoodundeuce,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was filmed and organised well by guys who clearly cared about the sport and showing it in the best light they can. That is the positive side of it. The negative side is what happened with the tournament in 2019. Podium competitors getting cut for 1 bad event was insane.This year really did mark a change for the competition, not a great one in my opinion. Yeah it created a change in the top performers but lowered the standard for the top (with the exception of Mat and Tia). Can you do 1 thing well? Great, you're now above an athlete who would beat you in 95% of events.The way the competition was originally ran, with no eliminations, made way more sense. You do bad on the first event? Rough, but you might win the next 7 which makes it irrelevant from a scoreboard standpoint. You've proven that overall you're fitter than the other competitors even though you have a weak-spot but with this, it wasn't the case. People who were barely average across the board stayed in and finished with way less points than dominant competitors would've just because one event tripped them up.We're no longer seeing the fittest, we're seeing the most consistently fine at best. It's great to give more people a chance, but it's a bare shell of former years.That being said I'll return to my first point and say none of these issues make this a bad doc. It's genuinely one of the more solid sports documentaries you can watch and keeps to the consistency that cannon and sawyer have shown with their coverage of crossfit.",False

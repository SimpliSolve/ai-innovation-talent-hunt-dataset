1,5,"""Their Shangi-La was being ruptured""",evening1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI thought this was going to be about Mars. But this atmospheric little documentary keeps us anchored to Mother Earth, and, specifically, to the tiny subdivision of Boca Chica, TX.That's where a handful of holdouts are adjusting to being neighbors with a property of SpaceX, from which wealthy entrepreneur Elon Musk plans to launch a spacecraft designed to help colonize Mars.Boca Chica sits on the Gulf Coast near the mouth of the Rio Grande, on a bit of real estate that hadn't changed much for years. Except for a handful of year-round or seasonal residents, the only traffic you'd see were a random fisherman or birder. Now, all manner of industrial vehicle trundle down a connecting road that can apparently be opened or closed at the company's will (although they do provide notice).We're told that Musk declined to be interviewed for this production, and that's a shame. We do hear from a handful of local leaders who laud the jobs and economic boost that SpaceX was expected to bring to the struggling Brownsville area. However, we don't get any hard numbers on what has actually transpired on that front.We also hear from a sprinkling of local residents, mostly women, with an understandably strong attachment to their modest home turf. ""Why should I give up my dream for Elon to accomplish history?"" asks one.Home owners were offered a triple-value buyout to pick up stakes and leave, and it seems at least one of them said no. As one resident reasons, where could she buy a replacement property on the water -- for $150,000?I wouldn't be happy if something like this happened on my street. I also understand that free enterprise is the backbone of this country. I'd have welcomed hearing Musk's side of the story.",True
2,1,poorly researched doco,jo_anna_123,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAnother poorly researched documentary. The first episode makes a claim that SpaceX offered little money to buy houses of people in the area. No data around how much has been offered besides one short glimpse a document that may or may not be an offer, what were values of houses in the area at the time etc. Just a few unhappy people talking how much they dislike Elon Musk.Side note - not everybody needs to be passionate about charity work. Some people are passionate about building rockets.",True
3,1,One more for the clickbait archives,donotdieforme,n/a,16/08/2025,Consciousness in the universe must be protected AT ALL COSTS!!!!I don't understand how people are eager to go to war for their countries but don't want to move from one place to an other for the protection of the only higher intelligence we have observed so far.,False
4,7,Murphy's law in action,calmirio,n/a,16/08/2025,Saving humanity by destroying a wild life reservation...WOW! Good luck with colonizing Mars with this kind of logic.,False
5,8,i thought it was a perfume docu...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"But i have come to the conclusion that ...elon musk must pay his rent... harrasing the wildlife, and the few residents that still live an eremital living out in nowhere. give the folks 10 times the properties market value, at least, then all parts can take the day and the hand of eachother.i know im not doing a tesla next carbuy...",False

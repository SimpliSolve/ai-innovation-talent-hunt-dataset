1,9,Can not view on PRIME.,tomsack,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wanted to watch this documentary as soon as it was available on Prime. Prime says: ""This video is currently unavailable to watch in your location"". My location is California, USA and I was ALLOWED to watch the Trailer only. I want to watch this on Prime not YouTube. What are they trying to pull here on Prime?",False
2,9,When Black Conservatives Succeed,EasyCompany1944,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watch this bio-documentary interview and decide, not judge, for yourself. It's not often that we get a glimpse into the very personal story and actual struggle of a determined minority Supreme Court justice of the United States.",False

4,10,An important piece for all to see,shadowtail-81463,n/a,16/08/2025,Desperately needed in a time in the history of this country where the Rule of Law is being tested by the liberal media and the liberal left. An important piece. We are ALL created equal. Period.,False
5,10,The Truth Exists. But we only have perspective.,McScared,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not a conservative. Nor am I a liberal. What I appreciate about this biographical look at Justice Thomas' life is that I finally get to hear his perspective. His story in his words. That was nice.I'm not surprised to hear a lot of partisan approval of this portrayal. But that is not why I enjoyed watching this film. .I remember watching the confirmation hearings live. I have subsequently heard a great deal about Anita Hill's perspective, but not Thomas' perspective. I now have a whole new appreciation for the man. Not because I agree with his politics, but because I at least have an appreciation of where he is coming from.While it's sad that the court has become so polarized and partisan in recent years, I still have faith in this 3rd, and co-equal, branch of government.I now understand how Justice Thomas can have such contempt for ""liberals"". I can also appreciate why liberals fear him. But until this biography appeared on PBS at 2 am, I didn't have the whole story.From my perspective, the Thomas confirmation hearings were the pinnacle of partisan self righteousness. Hill exaggerating the impact Thomas' comments had on her life, and Thomas exaggerated the impact of her allegations. I would have respected Thomas more if he just said ""Really, that's all you've got on me?"" But he didn't. He played the political hand he was dealt because that is what was expected of him. Shame on both sides.It's sad that the justices on the United States Supreme Court have degraded the stature of the court with celebrity personas, but it's not their fault. The public demands it after all. Everything good is eventually corrupted. Including me. Especially me.The Truth exists. But we only have perspective.",False
6,10,Travesty this is so hard to find or see,gustheaffen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, what an inspiring and incredible story. I requested at justicethomasmovie.com for this to come to a theater near me and it arrived for a week. It was still 90 minutes away and just one showing a day at noon, no signage on the theater or even on the theater it was in. But still 25 people or so showed and and boy was it just a wonderful movie to learn about a man that has been unfairly persecuted because of his political beliefs. Everyone should see this to understand his background, how he came to be the person he is, what he really thinks about the constitution and interpretation. This was a movie where every person in the theater just sat until the end of the credits really taking in the emotional ride. I really wish this receive more attention - it sure deserves it.",False
7,10,Best Movie I have seen in years,shieldsfrank,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, this is a powerful and emotional story of an incredible life. This is the first movie review I have ever written but liked it so much I felt compelled to do so. I thought it would be boring but was enthralled throughout. He is a complicated man but after watching this film his life makes total sense. To see a man go from such humble beginnings to the US Supreme court makes me proud to be an American.",False
8,10,A Surprising Life's Story,profschiler,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an astoundingly interesting film. It charts Thomas' life from abject poverty through life-changing help through disillusionment with the Catholic church to Black Marxism, Yale, hiring discrimination and into politics. And there it gets really strange, because the only job he can find is with a Republican and he hated Republicans.
It is required watching for everyone, even if you disagree with his current positions, so that you can at least understand your enemy. And it's kind of inspiring, chronicling how an African-American overcame the difficulties that (sadly) come with that.
And I now understand his position, completely. I understand that he has few questions because doesn't feel compelled to interrupt the presentations. Instead, he studies the briefs carefully, engages in the SC debate and writes decisions and dissents. It turns out he is the most prolific in writing up the arguments and conclusions.",False
9,10,Excellent and interesting life of Judge Thomas,colonel-13070,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thomas and his parents actually lived what so many crazy libs just talk about. I'll take this man's word over any ofbthem. Politics is an interesting thing. With the advent of big tech every word you say is likely to come back around at some point many years later. Situations that you found yourself in would likely come back around again involving other people. The hypocrisy of politics is front and center here. Thomas gets treated one way, and other politicians in similar Circumstances get treated completely different. You can see the left-wing playbook clearly, same thing used with kavanagh as with Thomas. Very sad for the Democratic Party to stoop so low. It is always been said when you have nothing else, play the race card. This guy was more accomplished than they ever expected, and a much better judge than they ever wanted him to be. He walks the walk and talks the talk.For some reason Amazon drops this movie during Black History Month. I saw it for free on Tubi streaming.I never could understand why successful minorities are not celebrated by their own when they have different views.",False
10,2,Clarence Thomas promotes his book,jake_fantom,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerClarence Thomas has led an interesting life - and likely few are familiar with its details. There are engrossing moments in this ""documentary"" when Thomas speaks of his childhood in the rural south, and his circuitous journey toward a career in law. But these are interspersed with tiresome readings from the book he is promoting, and from adoring anecdotes from his wife, herself a long-time Tea Party operative, and other far right supporters of Thomas and his ideology. What emerges is far from a balanced portrait of a man who has been accused by multiple women of inappropriate sexual behavior, and whose jurisprudence, in the opinion of many, has set back the cause of American democracy and equal rights under the law. So if you are a fan of Clarence Thomas and want to hear him tell his story in his own self-reverential words, this low-budget PR vehicle should fill the bill. If you are looking for a balanced portrait of the man, warts and all - this emphatically is not it.",True
11,10,"Brilliant Man, Brilliant Piece",helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having lived through the atrocities of Justice Thomas' hearing, re-watching it played out again during the nonsensical farce of Justice Kavanaugh's hearing, you see exactly what a travesty it was for Justice Thomas.This is our political system- seeing how wretchedly 'President Elect' Biden behaved, along with his abominations of colleagues such as Ted Kennedy, who knowingly murdered a young woman, and the rest of the sorry, good-for-nothing Democrats in the senate that convinced Anita Hill, without a shred of evidence to support such nonsense, to allege ridiculous things in the name of eliminating Justice Thomas because he didn't think the way he was 'supposed' to think, as a black man.We have God to thank for this great justice, and his life story is a tale of bravery, belief and genius, and I'm incredibly proud of his ability to stand and proclaim what he believed to be right.",False
12,1,Destroyer of a Constitutional Republic,forthetollferry,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would never believe a word this fake statesman says. It's obvious his modus operandi is not to serve the American public as he was sworn to do but rather to seek vengeance for whatever grievances his misanthropic persona has fostered and fermented over time, whether that's the Anita Hill investigation or affirmative action giving him a leg up or maybe just being born. You can see the bitterness just seething out of him, and no doubt to me his wish is to impart that rancor to the United States for perpetuity. Why would anyone want to pay homage to such poison?",False
13,10,Fantastic,antoniocassone2013,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had no idea I would like this documentary as much as I do, but ended up loving it by the end. What an interesting human being. Totally opened my eyes. It proves, you just never know a person until you hear their story. Loved his no holds barred approach to telling his life story. Bare bones and eloquent. Bravo!",False
14,10,Just watch it.,wendic-44654,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't even intend to watch this. It just came on after Antiques Roadshow, and figured I'd just change the channel at some point. I couldn't, this is completely engrossing. Highly recommended.",False
15,10,"Amazing Story, Amazing Man!",winterh3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every American should see this movie!
How tragic that amazon banned the movie from their streaming service and during black history month no less! A true American success story!
Justice Clarence Thomas is an amazing human being that should be respected by all and looked up to by youth, especially african american youth, yet amazon is doing their best to try to keep this amazing story from those who should see it and realize what OVERCOMING means. stop buying from amazon!",False
16,10,¡Fantastic!,despond-geo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a timely documentary from Judge Thomas owns' words. It shows how history repeats itself and how little has changed in politics. Aside from this, his story from a segregated South to Associate Judge of the Supreme Court is amazing and inspirational. Some parts are sad, especIally relating to his childhood and segregation. I learned a lot that I didn't know about Judge Thomas including how he hires non-Ivy League interns.",False
17,10,An important bit of oral history,jakelonergan,n/a,16/08/2025,"We finally get to meet the man and hear his story with emotion and inflection you just don't get from a book. Absolutely riveting as a biography, it also imparts fascinating historical tidbits about the America he grew up in.",False
18,10,Excellent story with crucial messages.,dstilt07,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, I am impressed! His own story from his very mouth sang as music to my soul. What a journey, with telling truths learned during the saddest of times. This is a great to-watch. no matter what your skin color, what your core values, this is one powerful story!",False
19,1,Misleading one-one sided revisionist history,PNWHiker,n/a,16/08/2025,"I sat through this, trying to be objective. This is a complete revisionist, telling of the history of his life. It's less honest than it seems. ) The writer, director, and Mr. Thomas use clever manipulation of archived media with a completely misleading story to make Mr. Thomas look like a victim. It's a pathetic ""documentary"".Of course, neo-conservatives will love it because it says what they want to hear, which isn't ""truth"".I was unimpressed with the quality of the interviews, which clearly were to help push a victim narrative. When you manipulate the story to be dishonest, it's not art. It's simply a weak effort to turn a reprehensible character of history into a victim.",False
20,10,Magnificent Documentary,bhkenez,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm rewatching and most impressed with Justice Thomas and even more disgusted with the vileness of Democrats. It's quite obvious why the liberal elites made every attempt to hide and sensor this magnificent documentary, Democrats are truly evil.",False
21,n/a,Wonderful Man,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a great life story. It is awful he had to go so much crap and still does. I have always liked him, I love him now. Wonderful man.",False
22,5,Petty,credea234,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this with the hope I would gain insight into what changed a man who was described as a radical at the height of the civil rights movement, and a Democrat to become such a staunch conservative. I didn't find it, nor did I find out about his judicial philosophy or honestly anything other than his pettiness. This is a man who through self-determination reaches the Supreme Court from a poor family, someone you want to root for but he gives you no reason to. He starts off wanting to be part of the church but, quits because of the anger he feels at classmates mocking the civil rights movement, changes to join, but little time is spent there. Then he is in college little time is spent there, then he is looking for a job, and blames affirmative action for his inability to find a high-paying job. Eventually, he gets hired by a Republican the only person that will hire him, and seems to be what changes his views, he gets a job with Reagan, and when he is criticized about joining he takes it personally. Oh, wait did I mention he worked for the EEOC? he spends little time here, or on his divorce, or finding a new wife, he spends more time pulling an MJ hall of fame speech complaining about everyone doing him wrong. The people that didn't give him a high-paying job out of college, his college, Juan Williams, In Living Color, The Senate which he claims ""committed a high tech lynching"", and the Black establishment at the time. This documentary is more about airing grievances, and attacking liberals. This could have been more, as could he but oh well.",False
23,10,A great documentary,dayana421,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great documentary, beautifully done, makes you stop and think. Enjoyed it.",False
24,10,Wow!,sunny_wells,n/a,16/08/2025,I have watched this documentary twice now! Once by myself and once with my family! I am so impressed with Justice Thomas and his accomplishments! He came from such a humble beginning and to climb to the highest court in our land is an accomplishment that embodies the American spirit! I absolutely loved this!! So much I didn't know about him; he makes you feel like you're listening to stories from a beloved grandfather.. LOVE LOVE LOVE.,False
25,10,Don't Cry Uncle,rehconcepts,n/a,16/08/2025,"Outstanding - this documentary shows the experience, depth and character of a man who possesses the spectrum of life and wisdom to be a Supreme Court justice. As Clarence Thomas relays in this concise documentary we need so much more of this to thrive and support the true diversity of thought. Judge Thomas illustrates and shows from his own real life treatment that the real injustice America struggles with is the manipulating and control of thought by the media and liberal think-tanks. He stands tall and survived it all - he is a true American success story that didn't succumb to the left mob or ""cow tail"" as he put its - he overcame.",False

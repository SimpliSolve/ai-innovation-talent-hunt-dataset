1,6,Scale!!!,henry8-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"Extraordinary look at a notorious London cinema that was uncomfortable, smelly and with a lousy sound system. It was though a focal point for thousands and thousands of different folk who could go there, often drunk, stoned or both, whoever and whatever they were without judgement. Its choice of films was deeply varied showing many classics but could always be relied upon to screen near to the knuckle films. Hence festivals could be as varied as Laurel and Hardy to kung fu and soft porn. As a documentary it is largely a series of interviews with people who had great memories of the place up to those whose lives were shaped / influenced by what to many of them was a second home, interspersed with many many clips.Not remotely pretentious or full of itself it is just an interesting record of an extraordinary piece of social history. Sadly the great days of the Scala have ended although I must say, in part because of rather freewheeling misguided decision to screen a banned film / break the law. Well worth seeing, particularly for film lovers.",False
2,8,A grandly grubby palace of wonders,Dether,n/a,15/08/2025,"Scala!!! Tells the story of the titular cinema, which, in its most famous incarnation, sat on a corner in a fabulously grand building in London's King's Cross. The building still exists and now hosts a nightclub and music venue of the same name, but is a very different proposition to the film club, which existed there between 1981 and 1993, having moved from its earlier location, where it showed films from 1978.This documentary tells the story of story of the club, and how it offered a haven to misfits of all stripe: lost boys and girls, gay, straight, punk, greaser, new romantic... even eccentric old ladies! It was a place to watch films, be educated, get messy, and engage in amorous pursuits. The King's Cross area has been transformed in the 21st century, but in the 1980s it was a seedy, edgy place, with a diverse community. Despite the off-putting environs, the cinema itself drew people from all across London, and beyond, those aforementioned misfits who found a place of welcome amid the depredations and social changes wrought by Thatcher and co.The film, co-directed by Jane Giles (who was programmer at the cinema) and Ali Catterall (who was a punter), manages to capture the character and appeal of the cinema. They achieve this by interviewing a wide selection of people who once came, or worked there, including John Waters (whose own cult films were of course part of the programming), Barry Adamson (who provides the excellent soundtrack too), Ralph Brown (who reprises his famed Danny persona from Withnail and I for the occasion), Mark Moore (S'Express), Caroline Catz, Mary Hannon, John Akomfrah, Jah Wobble, Stewart Lee, Beeban Kidron and many others.Between them they have some serious anecdotes, from being freaked out by the prowling resident cats slipping past their legs in the dark to finding a body. Woven throughout is a taster of the film club's remarkably wide-ranging programming, which included classics, arthouse, grindhouse, porn (soft, like Russ Meyer, or not so much, like the legendary Thundercrack), science fiction, horror and even plenty of mainstream films (like Alien and Predator), often lovingly crafted into all-nighters, offering the club members a place to stay warm and away from whatever woes their real lives presented. The programmes were published on distinctive posters, and their design style overarches the film.Scala!!! Or, the Incredibly Strange Rise and Fall of the World's Wildest Cinema and How It Influenced a Mixed-up Generation of Weirdos and Misfits, to give it its full title, is not only a wild ride, and an entertaining, frequently hilarious, watch, it's also an essential bit of history - both film history and social history, capturing a lost London experience that remains unique to this day.",False
3,7,"Great, nostalgic, fun. But too short.",FortySecondStreetFreak,n/a,15/08/2025,"""SCALA""...Doc on the legendary much missed London repertory/cult Cinema is fun, lively, heartfelt, nostalgic & packed with entertaining tales & reminiscences (& cool movie clips). Good interviews too (thank God for the blu-ray extra ones). Essential for Cult movie fans, esp ex-Scala punters like myself. Main criticism is the short shrift given to the Events. Especially as the last thing hosted there before it closed (last day ""King Kong"" showing aside) was the fabulous 'Full Contact with a Killer' Chow-Yun-Fat festival (with the lovely man himself as guest of honour), a GREAT moment in my life, but it gets no mention.Nor do they mention the 'Film Extremes' festivals that were personally my main time spent there.In fact an afternoon screening of ""Cafe Flesh"" was my only (I think) visit to 'The Scala' that wasn't an Event/Festival.A sad lack of live footage of the mural covered Cafe/Dealer room too, another solid memory of my time there.It also calls ""A Clockwork Orange"" banned & hints that's why they got into trouble for showing a 'pirate' print. But it wasn't 'banned', Kubrick withdrew it from distribution in Britain himself after much hassle over its supposed effect on crime. But Kubrick didn't do anything to help The Scala himself over this costly trial & should've got a bit of criticism here, but there's nothing (not a surprise really).And of course, it just too short to cover such a long period of time at such a fascinating place. But, in general, it's very good, lots of fun (with genuinely emotional moments) & a real gift for fans. Great memories from a great time.Get that blu-ray!",False
4,7,Fascinating if flawed documentary,cliveoverlander,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAlthough I'd heard of the Scala years ago (I'm 69) I'd never been there. Went to the BFI last week to attend the illustrated talk (although the youngest member of the panel - in het very estly 20s- was awful and added nothing. The other three were great and the clips shown (not in the documentary) were eye-opening and amusing bin equal measure. The documentary was well made and the clips, anecdotes and stills were also eye opening. The downside: it seems that towards the end the Scala degenerated to somewhere where the films shown were taking second place to opportunities for ""hooking up"" in any available area.Towards thecend of the film the directors blamed the fact that they screened the ""banned"" A Clockwork Orange for the uktimate closure of the Scala. This is not so. The truth is that the film was NEVER banned. Stanley Kubrick requested that the film be ""withdrawn from circulation"" in the UK after the furore whipped up by various media outlets and individuals. (It WAS banned in some countries, apparently, but NEVER here by the BBFC, but possibly by local authorities). The Scala was taken to court for Copyright Infringement and, sadly, lost, so there was a lot of money they had to pay out which they obviously couldn't afford. Great doco and I am just putting the record straight. Go see it.",True
5,8,have they really gone for ever?,christopher-underwood,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a rather good documentary and it is a decent spilt between the short clips of the films and the people who came to watch, the musicians, the film makers and those like me who also wanted to see those films. Actually I was a bit older than most and during the middle of the sixties towards the end of the seventies instead of Scala it was Time Out that was my bible. Every week I would read every film listing and find where I could go and see all those very strange films that I couldn't see anywhere else. Usually it would be the NFT (now BFI) on the South Bank, in Camden at the London Film-makers' Co-operative and then some fleapit cinema or maybe some that had all-nighters and of course the film clubs. Watching this today it really takes me back and I think everyone should have a look and see just how good it was and also those amazing posters. But now, not just has the Scala cinema gone, but also the films. We can watch those old ones again but where are any new ones of those 'incredibly strange' or have they really gone for ever?",False
6,6,"Artificial limbs,cats and toilets centre stage.",filmreviewradical,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis 2023 feature length documentary history of the Scala from 1978 to it's closure in 1993 is based on Jane Giles' book 'Scala Cinema : London 1978-1993', and was co-written and directed by her with Ali Catterall,and features archive film footage and photos,and a parade of 'weirdos' and 'misfits' (punks. LGBT+ers,drug enthusiasts, activists, and even cult cinema fans). We also have a flood of talking head interviewees,as posters are shown,clips are featured, and we hear about the odd dead patron,artificial limb, cats in the auditorium, and (emotionally) a suicide. David McGillivray is amusing as he surveys the Scala toilets, where a lot of the 'action' apparently took place, which he insists he never took part in - right at the end he alights on a toilet placed on the Scala's stage, and amusingly goes to investigate this possibly symbolic display. As to why the Scala closed in 1993 it's (according to some) Warner and Kubrick wot done it over 'A Clockwork Orange' - or maybe the asbestos in the roof.",True
7,8,Scala,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerBetween 1978-1993, more than a million people attended movies at the Scala Cinema in London, whether they were coming to see arthouse or grindhouse, kung fu or groundbreaking LGBTQ+ films. Out of that era, many members of those audiences became today's filmmakers, musicians, writers, actors, activists and artists.This documentary, directed and written by Ali Catterall and Jane Giles, this features John Waters, Mary Harron, Graham Humphreys, Alan Jones, Kim Newman Ben Wheatley, Ralph Brown, Beeban Kidron and so many more, all united in their memories of the theater and the life-changing films and moments they enjoyed there.Whether people came to see movies like Thundercrack or Eraserhead, the movies of Russ Meyer or John Waters, Laurel and Hardy or Sam Raimi, they knew that the Scala was where they would get to have their minds blown.Based on Giles' 2018 book Scala Cinema 1978-1993, this is a movie for movie lovers, plain and simple. The Scala got around so many issues because it was a members only club - the Severin set comes with a membership card of your own, as well as a poster - yet despite all of the drug use in the theaters, at least two reported deaths and showing tons of movies that couldn't have been shown in England, Scala was closed because they showed A Clockwork Orange and Stanley Kubrick had ordered the film to not be shown in the UK. This led to a lawsuit by Warner Brothers and the theater ended.The memories, however, could not go away. I've never had the opportunity to have a theater like the Scala but I wish that I had. I can live through this. This is a documentary and a set for those that live through movies, that dream of them, that want them to mean as much to others as they do to us.",True
8,8,"Very Interesting, and Good Fun",derek-duerden,n/a,15/08/2025,"Many people have their own memories of the Scala and my most vivid one is of a Werewolf all-nighter - if ""vivid"" is really a good word for an evening where I fell asleep during at least two of the six films!This excellent documentary captures many others' reminiscences of the place and the programmes, and features a wide range of contributors from various branches of the arts, illustrating how influential the place was and how it provided a gathering place for all sorts of misfits, many of whom felt marginalised not just by society but also by the legal framework of the time.Ironically, in these days of multiple streaming platforms, it is now much easier to see some of these banned and/or rare films in the comfort of one's own home and thus I suspect would undermine the business model for anyone who tried to recreate such a club today. But let's be grateful we had the Scala while it lasted...",False

1,10,Excellent,erhanipekciler,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sometimes no need to add any comments, just enough to write 'excellent' and for required 600 characters, I can write that 60000 times... Perfect narration, perfect documentary, perfect personality. I feel so grateful for having a star like Yildiz Kenter in the name of my country. In my opinion this country has to give her name to all art schools or some streets.. She is a real star like her name.. I watched this documentary with lots of feeling, sometimes sad generally happy. I think this is another level for theater, I mean working too much like her, it is unbelievable. Almost her whole life passed with theater. Perfect production. I love it from beginning to the end. Rip Yildiz Kenter. We will never forget you.",False

1,7,Review for EPCOT Becoming,Reviews_of_the_Dead,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a TV special that is a documentary about EPCOT at Disney. Jaime, my wife, added this to her watch list and I agreed to watch it with her. I wasn't sure what this was going to be about, aside from knowing the title. I've never been to Disney World, the one in Florida. I've been to Land though.What we're getting here is a brief history of EPCOT and why Walt wanted to build this. It sounds like he passed away before it was completed. The plan that he wanted to set up was heartwarming. I don't necessarily always agree with everything Disney does, but I'll say that I do appreciate they want people that come to their parks to have the best time. I know it is expensive. It also seems like you're paying for that high quality.Seeing the time and effort that they put into to making this special is great. They also show the prep to ensure that unveiling new things at the park are well-thought out. I was shocked to know that the closing down of EPCOT is an epic thing that happens nightly. Seeing everyone pitch in to their part was magical, to quote them.This is a fun documentary that flies by. If you're into Disney World and want to know a bit more about the time, effort and money that they use to make this part state of the art, I'd recommend giving this a watch. It was solid for what we got for sure.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",False

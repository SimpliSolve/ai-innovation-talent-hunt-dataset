1,9,excellent...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMade and told story about , by many, thought to be the worst white collar crime in south african history, the steinhoff scandal, made by and excecuted merely in solitare by the c.e.o. Markus jooste...its the psychopaths greed thats the issue here, but also working out the clinical sign of a countrys financial health and confidence thats being set under the limelight also...people loose money in investments, that is a financial law essentialy, but the culprits that makes people invest with green flags of rands or euros, always seems to slip away, that is the question all in all. Had it been in the 16th century britain, heads would litteraly have been rolling, but not in present society...im the kinda grumpy old guy that digs my money down a hole in my lawn, and never let anybody else breed on my assets, i know that is stupid and stubborn, but that is the only way to stay safe when money arent physical money anymore. Every country with some respect to themselves, should have special task forces with marshall law dignified powers to lock up culprits that are suspected and investigated for their wrongdoings while its investigated, when the circumstances are so obvious as in this matter. They should really have made an example on this crime incident...documentary wise this is a three part product where episode 1 and 2 are brilliant, the 3rd and summarizing episode is just like all the other fci productions and a bit of a downfall compared to the good start. There are nothing we can do anyway style...but an interesting look at RSA financial crime, therefore a recommend from the grumpy old man.",True

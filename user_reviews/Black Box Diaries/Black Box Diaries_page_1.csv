1,7,Shining a Light on Silencing and Survival,cutie7,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Black Box Diaries"" is a deeply moving and courageous documentary that tackles a social issue that is still shrouded in stigma yet destroys countless lives. Directed by Shiori Ito, the film recounts her own harrowing experience of sexual assault by a prominent journalist in Japan, an event that made her a key figure in the country's #MeToo movement. Through raw and intimate footage, Ito bravely documents her journey to seek justice in a legal system that had seen little change in over a century. Her story isn't just a personal account-it's a powerful critique of the systemic failures that have long silenced survivors.What makes ""Black Box Diaries"" truly stand out is how it balances the personal with the universal. Ito's willingness to turn the camera on herself, capturing her emotions and struggles, brings a deep sense of authenticity to the film. At the same time, it sparks a much-needed conversation about sexual violence and the urgent need for change, both in Japan and globally. The documentary is not just a retelling of one woman's fight for justice-it's a powerful call to action, reminding us of the ongoing battle many survivors face and the importance of challenging the systems that continue to let them down.",False
2,8,Hard to watch but powerful and daring,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.Shiori Ito creates a difficult yet compelling and powerful documentary about her experiences with sexual assault and exposes the corruption of Japan's legal system and the toughness of what she has went throughout. Ito's approach on the subject was well handled with good discussions, insightful information and great presentation throughout as many of the themes, twists, and subjects explored were quite difficult to watch, yet important to understand.Ito is really brave on creating this documentary to document her story and there are some conversations that were emotionally investing and quite frustrating to watch. Perfectly capturing the struggles of victims who encounter sexual assault and the corruptions of the legal system without feeling inappropriate and exploitive. It isn't easy to create such a story and I do applaud Ito for making this.With the #MeToo movement emerged years back, many countless documentaries about sexual assault have been created that were compelling and Black Box Diaries does an amazing job on exploring the issue and exposing the corruptions behind the scene.",False
3,8,Brave and self-documented quest for justice,panta-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"Japanese journalist Shiori Ito's brave and self-documented quest for justice is a powerful and emotional exploration of Japan's approach to handling rape victims, where only 4% of such crimes are reported to the authorities.Similar to the process of writing a memoir, the creation of this film serves as a therapeutic means of confronting trauma, allowing for reflection and analysis, and enabling others to engage with her experience and empathize with the cause. Through this endeavor, Shiori Ito emerges as a remarkable figure, one who has put aside her own comfort to advocate for necessary reforms in her country's antiquated justice system.In 2015, Shiori Ito was an intern at Reuters when she was drugged and sexually assaulted by Noriyuki Yamaguchi, the senior journalist and head of the Washington bureau for the Tokyo Broadcasting System. He refuted her claims, asserting that their encounter was consensual, exemplifying the all-too-common ""he said, she said"" dilemma that many women face. Throughout her struggle to file charges, she encountered numerous obstacles, highlighting a flawed system where the definitions of rape and consent are murky, and the process of obtaining a rape kit for evidence is fraught with challenges. This contributes, as I mentioned at the beginning, to the alarming underreporting of such cases in Japan.In May 2017, she finally decides to go public, making one last effort to push for an investigation into her case. She documents her journey, sharing her thoughts, the behind-the-scenes aspects of the court proceedings, and the writing of her memoir - and this was the part where it felt like a rae victim exploitation documentary! Just my feeling - uneasy one. With CCTV footage from that night and interviews with peripheral figures like the taxi driver and door concierge, we witness the online vitriol directed at her and the political connections Yamaguchi had, highlighting the immense frustration and scale of her struggle.Documentaries of this nature are challenging to watch, and they should be. Ito emerges as a natural journalist, relentlessly pursuing the truth amid the chaos. She is determined and strong, yet also vulnerable and fearful for her safety. She understands that her efforts are for others who have faced similar experiences and been overlooked. Aware that she will be labeled a victim and that this could impact her career and treatment by others, her bravery shines through. The film elevates her from victim to champion, and while the trauma of the assault occasionally surfaces, it does not define her or portray her as weak.",False
4,9,Powerful Doc Black Box Diaries Proves Bold Is Better,criticcoleman-37694,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being a documentary filmmaker is most assuredly hard, but then also being the focus of your own work even more so. But thankfully journalist Shiori Ito is no ordinary creator nor subject. As a bold and brave one-woman powerhouse who decides to get justice or die trying after being assaulted by a high-profile colleague, Ito displays both tenacity (she goes after the police chief with camera Nick Broomfield style!) and vulnerability (her honesty is heartbreaking) that is all but lacking from non-fiction flicks of late. Not to mention her examination and exposing of the Japanese legal system is a real eye-opener to the uninitiated. At a time when docs have become safe, Ito proves bold is better - can't wait to see what she tackles next.",False
5,10,Unveiling the Black Box: A Survivor's Fight for Justice,pinkmanboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Black Box Diaries,"" directed and starring Shiori Itô, is a documentary that transcends a personal narrative to become a collective outcry against a culture and legal system that allow sexual violence to go unanswered. From the very first moments, the brutality of what happened to Itô is laid bare through surveillance footage showing her being dragged, vulnerable and unconscious, by the man who would go on to shatter her-physically, emotionally, and (almost) socially.The documentary's power lies in Itô's ability to turn pain into action. This isn't a plea for sympathy; it's a demand for attention. In recounting her fight against Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a man shielded by his power and political connections, Itô doesn't just expose her assailant but also a legal system that catastrophically failed her. ""Black Box Diaries"" paints a disturbing portrait of contemporary Japan, spotlighting how an outdated, insensitive law from a bygone era still governs sexual violence cases.Itô's choice to show her vulnerability-whether it's crying at an unexpected gesture of support or nervously laughing in moments of discomfort-makes the film a deeply intimate experience. She takes us through her journey of trauma and recovery with relentless honesty. This is a raw, unpolished portrayal that refuses to hide the emotional scars left by her ordeal. Even the documentary's evolving visual style, moving from rougher aesthetics to a more polished finish, mirrors Itô's transformation-from a withdrawn victim to a confident filmmaker and activist.The film also shines a harsh light on the widespread insensitivity in Japanese society toward survivors of sexual violence. Messages Itô receives, like one from a woman who expresses sympathy for her assailant or advice to avoid showing her face in public, are heartbreaking. They reveal how survivors are often put on trial themselves, judged for their ""exposure"" instead of being supported for their courage. This revictimization, both in court and in the public sphere, is one of the most striking aspects of ""Black Box Diaries.""The decision to include moments where Itô speaks directly to the camera or films herself in private settings is a masterstroke. These scenes feel like intimate confessions, acts of trust that heighten the urgency of her story. The metaphor of the ""black box"" is particularly potent-the idea that her story, like an airplane's black box after a crash, holds undeniable evidence of a tragedy that cannot be ignored.Visually, the documentary is simple but never simplistic. The lack of elaborate aesthetic flourishes keeps the focus squarely on Itô's narrative, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere where every word and gesture carries weight. This stylistic choice reinforces the film's authenticity, ensuring the story is told with unfiltered clarity.One of the most moving moments comes during a phone call with the hotel doorman, who, despite the risk of losing his job, decides to testify about what he witnessed that night. Itô's reaction-crying and repeatedly thanking him-encapsulates the fragility and strength that define the entire film. These moments remind viewers that while Itô's bravery is extraordinary, she is, at her core, just a person taking on a colossal system.""Black Box Diaries"" isn't just a documentary-it's an act of defiance. It's the testimony of a woman who refuses to be silenced, turning her story into a tool for change. Watching it, you can't help but question the power structures that enable impunity and your role in challenging them. The film is a powerful, necessary work, reminding us that individual acts of courage can illuminate systemic flaws and maybe even spark their transformation.",False
6,7,Black Box Diaries,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is quite an harrowing watch at times whilst we follow Japanese journalist Shiori Itô as she seeks justice for an alleged rape a few years earlier. To be fair, up front, this is not a balanced documentary but a potent video-diary style presentation crafted by the woman herself to not only document the course of her own battle, but also to illustrate just how out-dated the legal processes were in a nation that's legal system still treated women as a possession of a man in many ways. We identify the accused - from whom we do not hear directly or via his representatives, and from there on we focus on her attempts to see him face her accusations. The film now concentrates on the courageous efforts of a woman to see that process of justice done. The laws that inherently obstruct her need to be identified, addressed and replaced so as not to protect, or be seen to protect, any influential people from heinous crimes of any sort. It also goes on to demonstrate quite effectively just how difficult - if you are to adopt the ""innocent til proven guilty"" approach that underpins so much of the legal system - it is to adequately codify crimes of an intimate nature ensuring that they are to be objectively dealt with. Especially problematic as there are so often no witnesser and/or extensive time lapses between the incident and any attempt at redress. It's also quite potent at illuminating what I feel are the frequently absurd differentiations between the evidence required for a criminal or a civil case. The latter always feels to me that it's more about balance of probability, sometimes even money rather than seeing the rule of law robustly and impartially upheld in the first place. This doesn't provide answers to these complex issues, indeed I suspect there are no straightforward answers - but that anyone has to go through this kind of emotional maelstrom just to get a day in court is something that the public ought to feel disgusted by.",False
7,10,Should take home the Oscar for Best Doc but won't,Jaws1391,n/a,16/08/2025,A very sobering example of how behind Japanese law and society as whole is when it comes to sexual assault and harassment.It makes absolutely no sense for there to be video evidence with multiple camera angles of someone being pulled half-conscious into a hotel with multiple witnesses saying she was trying to leave where it is later reported as a sexual assault and claim there is not enough evidence to even investigate it. It was an incredibly intelligent move to document the whole process of pursing justice as many who are not aware of how negatively victims are looked at in Japan would not believe it if you told them.,False
8,7,Black Box Diaries,jboothmillard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, it was later featured during Awards Season, and I was glad when it was broadcast on television, it sounded like it was going to be interesting. Basically, Shiori Ito directs this film which depicts the journey into her investigation of the sexual violence she experienced. In the past, she was associated with Noriyuki Yamaguchi, previously the Washington, D. C. bureau chief of TBS, a major broadcaster in Japan. He was famous for his articles on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and had close ties with several influential government officials. The film opens with CCTV footage from a hotel in Tokyo, showing Yamaguchi dragging the severely intoxicated Ito out of the car holding her up and taking her inside. After this night, Ito reported Yamaguchi to the police, claiming that she had been sexually assaulted using a date rape drug. However, the police refused to accept the case, citing a lack of evidence beyond Ito's memory. When Ito obtained the hotel surveillance footage, the police began to move forward with Yamaguchi's arrest and investigation. However, the investigation was inexplicably halted at the very last moment before an arrest was made, the case was dropped, and no charges were made. Faced with the failure of the investigation, despite warnings that it could damage her career and reputation, Ito decided to come forward publicly. Ito admits on camera that whilst gathering evidence, she had a panic attack seeing an image of Yamaguchi and reliving the horrific incident. She attended the press conference in person and made an accusation; she is later seen running towards Yamaguchi's car and attempting to interview him in person. This was extremely rare in cases of sexual violence in Japan and sparked widespread public reaction. In 2017, Harvey Weinstein's crimes and the ""MeToo"" movement broke out, gaining momentum worldwide, and when it reached Japan, support arose from women who resonated with Ito's experience. However, she faced slander online, with accusations that she had a political intention and was attacking the government. Ito continued investigating the case for over seven years, enduring a storm of relentless defamation and the anguish of sexual violence. One of the key figures in the film is ""Investigator A"", who directly leaked to Ito the crucial information that an arrest warrant had been issued but suppressed. Ultimately, a civil lawsuit against Yamaguchi was made and justice prevailed for Ito. It is suggested that this decision was made by high-ranking government officials. The film is constructed from footage on Ito's smartphone and other private video recordings, and the ending epilogue details that Japanese laws were changed when it comes to accusations of rape and abuse. Ito's agony and reflections are compelling, she was brave not just to come forward about her own rape ordeal but to endure the months of criticism. Conspiracies and cover-ups are uncovered, women are often treated as second-class citizens, and the authorities and laws of Japan are revealed to be callous. This film has details of the injustices in the law and shows courageous detective work, it is uneasy to watch in places, but thank goodness the lead protagonist succeeded through determination, it is a fascinating documentary. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, and it was nominated BAFTA for Best Documentary. Very good!",True
9,10,Legal Demands Threaten the Mission of this Powerful Film,atsuhiro-yorozuya,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film should be mindful that attorneys, acting on the wishes of copyright holders whose materials have been used without permission, have issued demands for immediate editing or deletion. These demands come from the very attorneys who represented the director in the civil lawsuit that features prominently in the film itself. If the attorneys' demands are indeed valid, it may discourage individuals or organizations from supporting evidence collection, even when survivors of sexual abuse bravely come forward. Such an outcome would deliver a severe and lasting blow to efforts to hold perpetrators accountable and secure justice for victims. Should this happen, it would call into question the very purpose for which the film was produced and publicly released.",False
10,7,Meetoo Japan,clecrom,n/a,16/08/2025,"Immersive documentary about a sexual scandal in the Land of the Rising Sun. Unfortunately, there are few Japanese landscapes shown, except for the skyscrapers of Tokyo. Under the camera of Shiori Ito, the political influence is meticulously dissected, while she conducts a self-therapy through this report on herself.At first, I had trouble getting into it, but the turning point for me was the episode with the Tokyo police chief. This documentary is clinical and shows that such scandals happen in the same way all over the world. However, I felt some frustration with the treatment of Abe's assassination.Finally, I wonder if this film belongs in the cinema or on television.",False
11,8,"I'm glad she had the courage to do this. It is rare, brave and commendable",lilianaoana,n/a,16/08/2025,"Japan's #meetoo moment. Hardly the same impact, because Japan is a shamelessly patriarchal society with a 100 year old rape law. A government official states that only 4% of victims actually come out and go to the police. 4%. And of those very few are prosecuted. This woman had witnesses, video footage of being incapacitated, some DNA on her body and yet... Kudos to the taxi driver who actually spoke on camera about what he saw and heard.When will we stop repeat victimizing and shaming women? Why is the sufferer of sexual crimes shamed and blamed and told to hide themselves and the offender not even talked about? Why are we using euphemism like ""incident""?This woman was clearly drugged to render her incapacitated and unable to resist. Men have been trying to get women drunk, drugged, to render them unconscious by any means for ages. It does not equal consent. Of course they know that. That's what they are trying to avoid.There are no consequences here for the politicians and the police chiefs. The footage of the parliament hearings is infuriating.Shiori Ito had support from friends and lawyers. She lost her livelihood. She was insulted and threatened. She became anxious and depressed. Now imagine what this could mean for a woman with no means and no people around her to have her back. And that is why most women choose to keep quiet. They whole lives are at stake. Stop asking women why they don't come forward. This is why. They are treated like criminals.",False
12,3,Disastrous Documentary,n-19024-42530,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a documentary, this film is an absolute disaster. The facts are displayed in a broken way, making it very difficult to sort things out for audience not aware of this incident previously. It does provide some first-hand evidence and materials, which is unfortunately the only good things about it, from my perspective.What is really hilarious is that the publication of these materials has not obtained legal approve from some of the related people. One cannot condemn others violating the law while doing the same thing himself.One interesting scene: one old lady works hard to support Ito but fails to recognize her when Ito is right in front of her.Of course there is politics behind the movie. Why is it relating the incident to Abe all the time?",True
13,10,The courage of Shiori is incredible. Bravo.,paultaylor-72821,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWow. This is an uncomfortable watch and not a happy one. But it is essential to understand the stupidity of japans government and how the patriarchy there is keeping it in the 1970s.I hadn't realised how many years ago it was set so was surprised it covered the birth of the #metoo movement and how out of touch Japanese society feels in comparison. But, I'm sure that with role models like Shiori out there, I know it will happen one day and these horrible men will no longer be able to get away with things.As a documentary it should be taken with a pinch of salt. As its title says it is less a documentary and more of a diary. So there are gaps and jumps and not everything is explained. Maybe a voice over would have helped fill some of the gaps but ultimately it's irrelevant as that isn't its point. This is a film with a message and the message is delivered loud and clear.",True
14,9,This Documentary is powerful,ks-60500,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary makes me feel what actually happened in a drama can happen in real life. The unfortunate encounter of Ito who being raped by a Japanese official Yamaguchi is the story about this movie. It documented the incidence happened in 2015 to 2023 where the case be ""settled"". Yamaguchi is a close friend of ex-prime minister Abe. It's very alike many movie storyline that how a native citizen flight again powerful politician from nothing to have something. The end of the story didn't happen to be what happen to those movies but it actually is what the reality ending is (you will find out what I meant after watching). Even the ending wasn't as ideal as I expect, Ito did win in all aspects and made the society a step forward against sexual violence. It's really moving for the collaboration of people in this case, the standout of victims Ito's seeking for justice publicly and the doorman part, highly recommended to watch a story that is something real happening in life.",False
15,8,Injury and insult,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen journalist Shiori Ito decided to seek legal redress for sexual assault, she chose to make this film about it. Thus 'Black Box Diaries' is not neutral; and Ito would be a poor journalist if she was not able to make good propaganda (in one section, she seems to be filming a suicide attempt and recovery, and I'm not sure I wholly believe it). Nonetheless, the basic facts are that her claims seem highly credible (and indeed, are eventually upheld by a civil court); that under Japanese law, proving criminal sexual assault is even harder than in most countries; that Japanese society downplays the seriousness of such crime; and moreover, that the alleged perpetrator was a friend of the then Prime Minister. Ito could have been forgiven for thinking her position was helpless; instead, she kept fighting, and ultimately won as clear a victory as could have been possible and got at least some in Japan to think about how and why her experience had happened. Sadly, one can all too easily understand why many who have similarly terrible experiences give up long before finding any resolution.",True
16,10,Her Truth Is Self-Evident,Planar_Being,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMs. Shiori Ito, the maker of this documentary, born 1989, was an intern at Reuters in 2015 when she met Noriyuki Yamaguchi, born 1966.Ms. Ito filed a lawsuit against Yamaguchi in September 2017 for allegedly raping her in a hotel on April 4th 2015, after she had met him to ask about a job opportunity. Yamaguchi was Washington bureau chief for TBS, Tokyo Ch. 6 TV, and also a biographer and close associate of then-Prime-Minister Abe.On 23 April 2015, Yamaguchi was dismissed as Washington bureau chief for TBS.Ms. Ito filed a police report in July 2016. This was dropped by prosecutors on the grounds of ""insufficient evidence.""In this documentary, she records the progress of her fight for justice in a paternalistic culture, against a figure with close ties to power at the highest level in Japan.Even by itself, Ms. Ito's demeanor and account are compelling enough for any reasonable person to be convinced of her truth. But what removes all doubt about her story, for this viewer, is the appalling sight of her being dragged almost comatose from a taxi and hauled into the hotel by Noriyuki Yamaguchi on that April night in 2015.You will find a single 2-star review of this documentary on this site. The reviewer has just that one review listed here. Reading it gives one an insight into the kind of mentality that the courageous Ms. Ito has had to face, and still faces in Japan.",True
17,2,"A Movie Review of ""Black Box Diaries""",mistyhexastyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPlease be aware of slight spoilers.1. What is the purpose of this movie?This movie's theme is 'A long time ago, a lady had been too drunk, leading to conflicts with an acquaintance.' The conflicts escalated into a civil case that lasted more than eight years. I watched this movie with this context in mind.In this review, I'd like to clarify that I will refer to the defendant as 'the man' who was charged with compensation for non-consensual sexual activities. 'The lady' is the plaintiff of this case but also ended up being charged with defamation in this case. Additionally, 'the lady' is the director of this movie, so I will refer to her as 'the director' in the context of the movie production.This is not referred to as a criminal case. I'd rather call this a 'conflict' than even an incident. I am going to review this monologue movie. This movie begins by being presented plainly and simply from the subjective view of the lady and the director.I felt that they had been filming from the early stages of the incident. This leads me to consider three possible reasons:
a. The film was made to raise awareness about the conflict that had occurred.B. The film was made in anticipation that a conflict might arise if the situations were not to my hope.C. The conflict was created specifically for the film.The filming was well-prepared, and there were some shots that I don't think the director would have been able to take on her own, so I believe she must have had some help with the filming. The lady was both the plaintiff and the director so 'c' is technically possible.2. Many notables are in the movie. According to IMDB.com, its cast includes only the director, though there are many notable people we can recognize in the movie. Those people don't have cast descriptions or named roles. One of them was carried by a stretcher due to a fatal assassination, which seemed quite inappropriate. How does this relate to the movie?3. Many real places are in the movie. There are recognizable places, including street views and the interiors of buildings. We can see these premises on news or video-sharing platforms. Are these scenes created specifically for the movie, or are they real conferences with real people? There is a scene showing a conference in the Diet.The story is based on the director's court experience, which I have read about and am somewhat familiar with. At the very least, we can recognize the people's occupations who the lawyers, police officers, taxi drivers, and others are in terms of their roles and occupations in each scene.The movie repeatedly shows the director's emotions when she struggles, feels disappointed, experiences joy, and gets upset. Additionally, it portrays her childhood with her family, which evokes sympathy. However, the movie does not explain what happened, what went wrong, or how events unfolded. I am left unsure of how to interpret it. It didn't change my view of the conflict. Go, director, please make a persuasive movie!4. If the audience is not familiar with the story I wonder where the positive reviews come from. In fact, IMDB.com rates this movie 8 out of 10. Not all audiences can quickly grasp the story using only their imaginations. Additionally, the director's sayings are often not clear enough. Most of the time, she doesn't finish her sentences in the script, regardless of whether it's in English or Japanese. It's as if she's saying, ""Please imagine what I want to convey through my acting.""5. Here comes the climax like an acrobatics show. This climax is like an acrobatic giant slalom in the circus. Dull audiences who are unable to make insinuations or guesses will only sense the director's melancholy and are unlikely to express any sharp criticism. They must have lost their focus, feeling drowsy, checking the clock to see how much time is left, and considering stopping watching. Now the sensational scenes begin.6. What do the last 3 scenes consist of?A. All of a sudden, the screen shows that a person who has been shot is being carried by a stretcher.B. There is an SNS post with pictures of three people: the person who was alive before being carried by the stretcher, the man, and the deputy prime minister, along with a message of loss from the man's account. The screen then goes dark with white letters saying, ""The civil court victory on the same day.""
c. The lady in the back seat of a car on the highway is exaggeratedly giggling with her face up and her mouth wide open, celebrating the civil court victory.Do these three scenes have a meaningful connection? The sequence of death, the message of loss, and giggling in a row feels excessively cruel for the audience. I am trying to interpret it positively:
1. The lady felt sorry for the loss.2. The lady felt heartbroken by the message.3. The lady can't help hiding her joy of victory.Does it really need to show the death of the former Prime Minister of Japan, even though the events occurred on the same day? What is the reason for including this scene right before she is wide-mouthed and giggling? It makes it seem as though she is glad about the Prime Minister's death. Additionally, is it merely a coincidence that both events happened on the same day?7. In summary
The director says in the script, ""I have to have a job or I have to work,"" but it is not clarified whether she already has a job or not. Her life in the movie doesn't show any money for bills or time for maintaining her life. She has been with her lawyer for more than 8 years, and she has never shown her concerns about time or money. She spotlights gender rights before basic human necessities, which feels detached from real life.She is not the only one living in a global circumstance and having heavy responsibilities. We all live with human relations and family matters as usual. When we encounter unexpected challenges like she did, I expected to see how she managed to solve them wisely.",True
18,n/a,Vital Oscar nominated documentary,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"BLACK BOX DIARIES (2024) Nominated for Best Documentary Feature. Journalist Shiori Ito's intimate film about her sexual assault in 2015. Ito's first person account details not only the crime but the public outrcry and her subsequent book ('Black Box') and civil trial. Her assailant, Noriyuki Yamaguchi, was not only a fellow journalist, but also a close confidant of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (Yamaguchi claims the encounter was mutual).Ito's documentary is, by it's nature 'one sided'. There is very little objective news footage. It's her story, compellingly told. She isn't always seen in a favorable light and even her own family was against her going public with the accusations. Her attractiveness was used against her by opponents claiming she 'set up' the man. The police never arrested nor charged Yamaguchi with the strong implication that his ties to the Prime Minister put pressure on law enforcement to look the other way. Ito's book and civil lawsuit sparked a furor and movement to update the Japan's criminal laws which place the burden on the female victims.As a film about journalism, BLACK BOX DIARIES has given rise to criticism that Ito filmed many of the participants surreptiously and without consent. There are legitimate concerns raised, with the defense that the filmmaker was documenting a news story, her book has been published and the case has been tried and appealed all the way up the Supreme Court. Still, they are questions worth considering. The film has not been released in Japan.BLACK BOX DIARIES tells a vital story of a woman who became a virtual one person Me Too movement. Ito's quest continues on both with her emotional recovery and spreading the word of the movement.",False

1,10,Watch it and judge for yourself.,WorkingOnitRightNow,n/a,16/08/2025,"Insightfull. Facinated that with a rating of 7.7 on IMDB the featured reviews give it 1.5... ME/CFS: the illness millions are left waiting for science to catch up and offer credible solutions. The film explores the problems sufferers face in trying to push for change and the obstacles they face. Lives torn apart and hung out to dry by a virus that seemingly came out of nowhere. They recover from the virus but are left with the symptoms years after first infection. In the aftermath of Covid, again a debilitating ilness in which people recover but millions are left in a state of suspended ill health. The answers are out there waiting to be uncovered ... essiential viewing.",False
2,2,Not great,perrywynkles,n/a,16/08/2025,"It shows one person who has written a book. Her book is behind her on the shelf as she speaks. That is just advertising for her book.Someone else says her room she lives in bedbound is about the size size of a coffin. That is the sort of emotional nonsense that makes a mockery of these ME films. They love drama. It is no wonder they are told they have a mental disorder.It is the film maker trying to invoke emotion when they should be investrigating science. It did not tell the full story of Sophia Mirza either. She wanted to record the doctors. Why would someone very sick care about recording the doctors?Seemed very pro Milkovitts .I do not know the full story about Judy and the Whittemore Peterson Institute so cannot comment further. Also Milkovitts has turned out to be a conspiracy theorist involved with nonsense covid claims. That would make me question her claimsAnd there is no evidence for Myhill's diet. If it were that easy why don't the many doctor sufferers just go on Myhill's diet. Of course she is only available to the people with money as is Dr Peterson and probably all the doctors featured.The film spells Dr Francis Ruscetti, a male, as Frances, the form of this name which is used for females.It is a tired old same ground documentary covering the same ground, the same doctors, the same comments as previous ME films. Some truly brave film maker needs to make a fully investigative objective documentary including the people who have no money and cannot afford Peterson et al. How do they manage?And far too much time given to the mouth Mikovits.",False
3,1,SO Many problems...,IdaSlapter,n/a,16/08/2025,"...with this documentary, not enough time.Suffice to say, this documentary is already outdated, even though it was made about 8-10 years ago (and then finally released in 2016).Too much time is spent on Judy Mikovits' ""discovery"" of XMRV, the retrovirus she insisted was the cause of ME/CFS, that later turned out to be a contamination.Too much time is spent focused on the suffering instead of answers and stories of recovery and/or remission, of which there are many. At least the filmmaker interviews Sarah Myhill, who HAS had success treating ME/CFS patients, but she's only interviewed for about 4-5 minutes, while the thoroughly discredited Mikovits gets about a half hour of screen time.And irony of ironies, one of the most famous patients interviewed as part of the XMRV controversy, is now doing much better, thanks to brain-retraining -- where one deals with psychological triggers -- something so many ME/CFS sufferers have FOUGHT -- including myself -- until we realize the brain is indeed connected to the body, and it can help us heal, if we stop running from these subconscious and conscious thoughts that indeed affect our health.",False

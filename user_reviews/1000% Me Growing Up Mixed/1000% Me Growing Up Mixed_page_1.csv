1,10,What a Great Conversation Starter!,JayDeadieEagle,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film needs to be shown in schools across the country to get children talking about what it means to be mixed race!I grew up in a small town that is predominately white. I myself am half Chinese and half Swedish. To this day, I still cannot discuss being mixed with anyone in my home town, including my parents. It is a heavily discriminated group of people here, to the point that more people will discuss black power than Asian-American and ESPECIALLY MIXED people of color in our community. Nobody is accepting of me, on either side. I'm not chinese enough, not white enough. I don't get to be a part of either culture, which is a topic not fully discussed in this film.This film doesn't tell the whole story for all of us, but it does point a spot light in an area that deserves some growth. I will do my best to share this film with people to get some sort of understanding from those around me, and I wish anyone reading this will do the same. We are all people, our stories matter.",False

1,8,Great documentary about a charismatic legendary fighter.,zkiko,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't know much about Camacho before I watched this very interesting documentary. I had echoes in my mind of what I heard as a child in the 80's. I remember people saying his name.
This documentary showed me a lot about Camacho's life, his charisma, his ambition his lust for regoncitnion. It was beautiful to witness. I felt sad seeing him decline and battle addiction.
Again and again kids grow up to be broken if they didnt get the right ingredients growing up or the right support later on as an adult. Something was missing and he seemed to find it temporarily in drugs.
Nevertheless a very interesting life and he has left behind a stamp of unbound charisma.
I hope his loving mother gets her peace and that they will find the killers that claimed his life.",False
2,10,Macho Time,jesstor-62528,n/a,15/08/2025,"Camacho was once asked if he thought they would ever make a movie about his life. He replied, ""They better"". If there was one to be made, this one did him justice. Boxing is a brutal sport. What is even more brutal, is the private life behind some of these gladiators existence. It's more than a story of what happens to an athlete as their career fades, the lights grow dim, the cheers and adulation subside.I was born and raised in East Harlem, ""Macho"" was a near mythical persona.
He was a person and a personality. A maestro in the ring, a master showman outside of it. The last time I saw him up close, there he was, alone eating hotdogs outside of Papaya King on East 86th Street NYC. Chomping down, smiling and waving, shaking hands with everyone. I called out, ""Hey Champ"", he looks at me with that million dollar smile, waves me over and says, ""come here bro, don't be shy"". He gives me a tighter than ever bro hug. I can feel how solid and strong he is. He made me feel as if I were a long lost friend.Did I know him personally? No. Did I love him like my own brother? Absolutely. This film added to his legacy in so many ways. It'll introduce people to a Hall of Fame pugilist. It would shed light on the demons that possesses addicts. It will make people see for themselves how flawed very talented people could be.Camacho meant a great deal to the Puerto Rican people of East Harlem. He was my Generations hero. He was fun to watch. He was an artist in what's known as the ""Art of the Sweet Science"". He patterned his style after Bruce Lee. He created his own jab. His speed, combinations and tenacity were electrifying. His ringside costumes rivaled Cher's and Liberace's combined. Yet, he suffered internally, like most super stars do. The gentleness and thorough look at his life through this film was done with the respect that would require a fondness for the sport.This is more than just a documentary about a boxer and his life in and outside of the ring. It is a story about a Mother's unconditional love for her son. A friend, a father and maybe the redemption of a character who is perhaps one of the most misunderstood Hall Of Fame boxers of the twentieth century.It's Macho Time on Showtime!A must see not only boxing aficionados, for anyone wanting to experience a time capsule to one of the greatest, if not the greatest period in Boxing history.Well done.Jesse T",False
3,9,A must-watch. Even my wife was glued to the screen.,zarehzatikyan-29560,n/a,15/08/2025,"I got into boxing in the early '90s, just as Camacho was getting out of his prime. I knew he was a legend but didn't know just how good he was. I was completely oblivious to his fascinating story.Besides the fact that the substance of this documentary is so good, it's also well-done.If you're a boxing fan, you must watch it. If you're not, you're still going to enjoy it a lot.",False
4,10,Macho time!,mathpro-52390,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was an incredible depiction and recounting of Hector Camacho's interesting life and mysterious passing. I was captivated by him and those around him throughout the whole film. If you like boxing at all or just want to hear and see a fascinating story, please give this a watch!",False
5,10,A Meteor,bernish-35144,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hector Camacho was a larger than life character -- a boxer, but also a showman, an entertainer, a humanist, a loving family man, an electric personality who emerged on the scene like an uppercut to the jaw, and kept on sizzling until it all collapsed, just like a meteor hitting the atmosphere.I was entranced watching this exceptional bio doc. Camacho's rise and fall are portrayed with honesty and empathy, never judgemental but always focused on the man -- the kid -- beneath the glitz and glamour, and the drugs and the thugs.The ending, which I will not reveal, was like a punch to the gut; I didn't see it coming, and I doubt any other viewers will, either.Heartily recommended, even if you have no interest in boxing.",False
6,10,Compelling story,jennyingber,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm not much of a boxing fan, but watching this tale of a mother reminiscing about her son really resonated. We all want the best for our kids and it must have been an incredible ride watching your child rise to a pinnacle of success and then devastating to see his fall. I hope the family holds onto their most joyous memories and finds peace at some point. It is heartbreaking to have loss so young and no resolution. The movie was really engaging and I found myself both laughing and crying.",False
7,10,"Great film, a must watch",chrislopez-72316,n/a,15/08/2025,"On the edge of my seat the entire movie.God bless his mother, she stood by her son 100%
A great story about an outstanding boxer unfortunately, drugs took over his life.",False

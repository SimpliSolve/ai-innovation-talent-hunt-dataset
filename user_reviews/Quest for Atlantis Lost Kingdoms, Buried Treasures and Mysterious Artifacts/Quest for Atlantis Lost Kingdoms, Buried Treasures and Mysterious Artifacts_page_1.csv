1,5,Stay for the closed captions,heatherhall81,n/a,16/08/2025,"Admittedly, I tried really hard to watch this, as I am interested in Atlantis. However, I need to watch with captions on due to an obnoxious dog in my house. While the documentary itself was... okay, the captions 100% distracted me in the most hilarious way! I don't know who was responsible, but the wording was too far off to learn anything other than how to butcher Robert Sarmast's name (poor thing!). I saw everything from ""Sawdust"" to ""some ice"" and ""Trenches Psalmist"". This goes on and on. If you're looking for comedy, this is it. I wish I could say the rest was informative, but my distraction level was way higher than learning, and I had to turn it off after 17 minutes.",False
2,7,Interesting but....,sunflower-176-611522,n/a,16/08/2025,"Only a very small portion is about Atlantis. The rest is about lost nations or cultures around the world.It is definitely interesting but if you're looking for something specifically about only Atlantis, this is not it.But it's only a little over an hour long, so not a huge waste of time. There were mentions of cultures that I never even heard of before, so that was good. If you like unusual or mysterious history, you'll probably enjoy this. It would've been interesting. If some of the people that were mentioned as believers in these lost kingdoms or discovers of them would have been shown talking about it instead of just the narrator.All in all, I do not regret watching this.",False

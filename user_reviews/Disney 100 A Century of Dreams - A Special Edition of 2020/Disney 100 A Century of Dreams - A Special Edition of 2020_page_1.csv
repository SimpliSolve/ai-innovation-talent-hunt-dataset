1,5,Disappointing,ossie85,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was actually enjoying this as a documentary. I knew it was going to be very pro-Disney with not any balance, but I was engaged with the origin of Walt Disney, the animation and the park. I thought it showing Disney's cultural impact was also important....... but it devolved, particularly in the last third, as an extended commercial at best and propaganda at worst.Disney will forever be a favourite of mine, right or wrong, but there's so much history and impact to fill dozens of documentary, so a shift to selling a brand (that people have already bought) is a disappointing decision by the film makers.",False

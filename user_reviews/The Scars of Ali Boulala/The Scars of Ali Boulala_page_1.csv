1,9,Gripping,fanny_lillings,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn important film about the feeling of being on top of the world, just to have it crumble beneath you.The depiction of Ali really makes you feel compassion for the guy. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that he has suffered through this tragedy, both physically and emotionally. I can't imagine the feeling, but the survivor's guilt is very prominent. It could have been like any other night, right? Which must be so incredibly difficult to come to terms with... The fact that I feel that I almost know Ali after watching this, proves that this film really did it's job. A young person caught up in the lifestyle really resonates with me, like it could have happened to anyone.Amazing film, dealing with some very heavy topics and a glimpse of hope to come, definitely recommend!",True

1,6,Confusing Without Narrative,The-Sarkologist,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is basically a documentary about how Christian nationalism, and how this concept and the Bible don't actually see eye to eye. However, I can't necessarily say that it is a good documentary because I don't feel that it provides enough of a commentary as to what is going on. Like, at the beginning we have a number of people speaking who believe that the Bible supports violence, and provide bible verses to support that view. This is confusing because it is starting to come across as a documentary that supports right-wing Christianity.Mind you, my realisation changed when I discovered that one of the people they were talking to was Preston Sprinkle who, while he is conservative, doesn't subscribe to that brand of Christianty. In fact he has written a number of books about how we have got it wrong with dealing with the LGBTQ community. From the standpoint of this documentary though, it has more to do with his book on pacifism than on the way we treat non-Christians as the enemy, and act violently and aggressively towards them.Anyway, the main purpose of this documentary is to demonstrate that it is actually nothing new. Like, Christianity was on the fringes right up until Constantine claimed to have had a vision before going to war against one of the other Emperors. He then proceeded to make Christianity the dominant religion in the empire. However, the problem is that for a pacifist religion, running an empire doesn't quite work. As such, a lot of theology came out around the idea of the just war, and this has come down to our time.The problem with the just war theory, and fighting a war against Satan, and claiming that the enemies of the church are a part of the war against Satan is that it leads to the justification of violence, which doesn't sit quite well with loving your neighbour. Mind you, the last president that actually took a pacifist stance, Jimmy Carter, only lasted one term. So, it makes you wonder if you can actually be a political leader when a part of your job is going to war.Another problem that arises is the idea of creating a safe environment. We need police to make sure that we live in a safe society, and to be honest there are a lot of countries out there that have police forces, but they are only violent when it needs to be. Like take England for instance, where the police wander around unarmed. Some teachers have argued the need to keep the country secure, but this leads to the idea of fighting your enemies before they can get to your country, which is the doctrine the US follows. However, that leads to some controversial wars.As I said, it is an interesting documentary, but the problem that I found is the lack of a narrative. Sure, the idea is probably for us to listen to the people that are talking and to come to our conclusion, but I would have liked there to have been a narrator to build up the argument better.",True
2,2,All over the place strawman,pezevenchiul,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie consists mostly of progressive activist ""preachers"", conflating everything from neo-con, hollywood, blm, anti-nationalist and anti-gun propaganda with traditional Christian-American values, in order to justify their political interpretation of the Bible. As always, their interpretation is the correct one, and everyone else is wrong.",False
3,10,Timely Documentary,liannaklassenart,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a GREAT documentary. Highly recommend. I think all the negative reviews are from people who don't want to face truth about the state of the American church and the buying into Empire. If anything, it will create dialogue that needs to be addressed.",False
4,10,A necessary film - especially after January 6,Dirk_van_den_Berg,n/a,16/08/2025,"American flags, the christian cross - oh, the symbolism. God and country. A myth for anybody who did not grow up in America, such as the mythical belief that violence toward others is a ""god given"" right, especially if you're the stronger one.The enlightenment seems to have given the USA a pass altogether.As a European, watching this documentary makes me not want to travel to certain (United) states anymore. But then again, when I watch combat axes and assault weapons hanging on the walls of a bible-quoting police officer, I say to myself ""sure, this guy is American"". Because if that scene was filmed in Europe, I would call him a dangerous person, who dangerously separates the world between ""us"" and ""them"" - the righteous and the others, the wrong ones who are different and therefore can be ""punished"".Almost nothing in this film comes as a surprise - religion and patriotism go hand in hand in a ""country of immigrants"" where government is considered a nuisance and pro-gun speakers talk about ""god given right of self defense"".What does come as a surprise though is that most (not all, but a I'd say 9 out of 10) of the characters in the film are - white. And most of them are - male.It took Kevin Miller great courage to make this film. I myself did films about religious extremism in the Middle East and Northern Africa. I'd feel queasy if I lived in those countries, because I know how much hatred is there especially from religious fanatics. So, Kevin Miller who lives in the United States is most of all, a courageous director. His film is so well done that it is almost unbearable. Watching it, sometimes I would have liked it to be worse - not as well researched, not as well filmed, not as well edited - to give myself an excuse to stop watching. Because watching it is HARD (did I mention I am European?).Yes, this is a necessary film. Nowadays, people are not used to hear anything that is not in line with their own beliefs. So, I am afraid that people ""on the other side"" will avoid it. Like... the devil.",False
5,8,Don't like it - don't watch it,papelindholm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Apparently there will be quite a few reviews by the subjectively enlightened claiming this isn't a fair picture of the CN going rampant in real time in the United Provinces of America, for the rest of the world to see. However, the rest of the world - litterally all of the northern European countries, for instance - has retrospectively shown to be far more experienced in these escalated situations, how to handle them and especially how to avoid them in the first place. Proclaiming dichotomous thinking is not the solution, as clearly displayed.Developing the education system accordingly when recognizing deficiencies therein - not going willfully backwards politically just to maintain power by any means necessary, ie. at the expense of everyone and everything else - how is this so hard for a (self-appointed) great nation alike? 'I know about what USA is b'cuz I live here!' Really? The rest of the world knows, too, AND about everything else.Given the possibility such a movie perhaps isn't of the top notch being made representing the situation in the states, one must however appreciate it is unfortunately the perception the rest of the world has of at least half of the population in USA for the time being - regardless this documentary, that is. The question is if this half is actually willing to do anything to make it better.",False

1,1,The lowest tier garbage insult of a documentary,thepilotred,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unflattering pictures of Matthew at his lowest, a random ""O'Neill"" woman excusing the assistant who killed him and laughed about it in texts, and a random advertisement for Ketamine being a miracle drug that more people should have access to.Did you expect that from this documentary? Because that's what it is. It doesn't go deep on anything meaningful, like the people behind the drug ring that killed him, and likely countless others, nor is it anything more than an exploitation of a celebrity's death.One of the kindest souls, one of very few in Hollywood, who struggled with mental illness his whole life and was exploited by the people he trusted, to death - this is the ""documentary"" we get for him.",False
2,1,Gross misuse of a persons loss of life.,alex02021994,n/a,16/08/2025,Felt absolutely filthy watching this. Absolutely appalling dragging the late Matthew Perry's name through mud with over dramatic narrative views. The dramatised music was also so gross and unnecessary. Just goes to show the producers of this show will capitalise on anything and anyone including the loss of life. They have no moral values. I ended up turning it off. 0/10 don't watch. They never would have done this unless he wasn't here to defend himself. The lack of respect is outrageous and undignified and his family don't deserve this whatsoever. I hope for their sake they don't watch this garbage.,False
3,10,Great documentary,bradychaos,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerInsightful documentary about Matthew Perry, dangers of too much usage of certain drugs, trusting someone so much that it leads to unfortunate and tragic consequences (personal assistant).The film is giving a perspective that life can be horrible, even if you're famous; you are still a human, battling your own demons.I wonder how it's possible that his coworkers didn't know what was going on, some knew perhaps?Either way, give it a watch, it's knowledgable, gives you information about ketamine treatment in general.I hope the justice gets served for those accountable in Matthew Perry's death.",True
4,4,Completely Ridiculous Amounts Of Blame,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm sorry for Matt's death- it truly is a sad tale and an incredible lack of responsibility on many parts; however, people pass EVERY SINGLE HOUR OF EVERY SINGLE DAY due to addiction issues, and there's rarely this level of accountability applied. But because Mr. Perry was famous, now California is going above and beyond to bring people to bear for his death. The obvious point that's being missed is, Matthew and his struggles with addiction. He was well aware of his issues, and to willfully accept ANOTHER drug treatment fix with a different drug goes against everything any addict will tell you is very stupid.Make no mistake, there's many people who took advantage but ultimately this belongs to Matthew. However, the absolutely insane levels of excusing by Ms O'Neill are disgraceful; if you are an 'assistant' and asked to do something that goes against every single thing you believe, that's on you if you choose to continue.It's no wonder these Hollywood types are so obnoxious about everything- from their hilarious singing during lockdowns, crying for attention, stomping around inserting themselves into the political sphere, injecting their faces with Botox, whining about everything. As if they're the only people who've ever suffered through this thing they're currently saddled with, except they're steeped in mountains of money to overcome the adversity, and then wonder why we have little to no sympathy for their hysterics.Any drug dealers should absolutely be punished, but on the same scale as whoever they happen to destroy, not just because it was someone famous.",False
5,2,Second-rate tabloid-style documentary,aldmph,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a disappointment this was. First of all, there was nothing new in it - just all the details in one fell swoop. There were very few original interviews, and most of those were with tabloid reporters. One thing that did catch my attention, though, was Perry's diction in the excerpts from his audiobook and the interviews he conducted about his book. He was sober at that time, but his speech was a little slurred, as if he were recovering from a stroke. I wondered if he had suffered some neurological effects from his years of drug abuse. Other than that revelation, I'd say this program is a must-miss.",False
6,3,Mattew Perry - A Hollywood Tragedy,mmuggi,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is clear that the documentary is interested in capitalizing on Matthew Perry's death. It becomes almost a crime drama in narrating the story of the pill sale, rather than truly honoring Matthew Perry. However, it is wrapped in a ""try"" to shed light on Matthew Perry's life and career, which of course also involves his struggle with addiction.There's something really hypocritical about these documentaries that take a real-life tragedy and turn it into entertainment while pretending to be a tribute or a serious examination of the addiction crisis in America. For instance, this documentary tells you absolutely nothing that you didn't already know about Matthew Perry and his tragic death, and it really doesn't do a good job of paying tribute to him as an actor either. Those clips from Friends are the same ones you've seen in every other special about Matthew Perry's life. There's really no reason for this documentary to exist other than to appeal to viewers' desire to learn something sordid about a well-known figure. It's a documentary that exploits Perry's death while claiming to mourn it.And I'm not saying anything that you haven't already heard or that hasn't been said by a hundred other people. Nearly every review I've read of this documentary basically says the same thing I just did. It's exploitative and doesn't add much to our overall understanding of how someone with so much talent and so many fans could also be so self-destructive. Yet, while we all criticize documentaries like this, many of us still watch them.",True

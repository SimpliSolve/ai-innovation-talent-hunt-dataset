1,9,A prime example of balanced reporting,maximusynin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched the movie after reading a review about it in Weekendavisen, where it was promoted as an opening movie for the 2020 Copenhagen Documentary Films Festival. The festival later went online due to the quarantine.
The movie presents a careful observation of the relationship between Greenlanders and Danes, where the struggle for recognition of the former takes place on different levels: local politics, health and social services, natural resources, language. Its not the type of struggle we hear often on the mainstream media, its much more subtle, yet easy to relate with its well-crafted personal stories. The movie follows the best traditions of Scandinavian journalism and its allegiance to objective and neutral reporting.",False

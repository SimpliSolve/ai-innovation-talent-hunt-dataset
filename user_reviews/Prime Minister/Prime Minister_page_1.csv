1,8,Sundance 2025 sunday viewing,davidevans13,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nice. Kept me engaged and interested. Having been to New Zealand just prior to the major events taking place (the mosque, weapons ban and covid) it was interesting to see how Ardern's views and decisions were made based on being a mother with her small newborn daughter. I think the documentary was able to capture the stress, the feelings, the anxiety, the immense responsibility that any politician or decision maker might feel during a stint in office. Certainly nothing to take lightly and I feel that the film makers ability to capture that mantle that lies on world leaders was fantastic. I applaud PM Jacinda Ardern for her resolve as such a young female leader.",False
2,10,"Truthful, wonderfully well done documentary",ztempler,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had to write a review though I very rarely do. I'm an American expat and a New Zealand citizen. Experiencing first hand the Jacinda years, especially as a comparison against the Trump years, she was an amazing and inspirational national leader. This film accurately captures what it was like during her tenure and how all of the country felt towards her, good and bad. What happened at the end of her tenure is a national disgrace. We lost a great leader and this film accurately portrays this too. It also happens to be a very well made documentary, fully engaging from beginning to end. Negative reviews are clearly political and from the opposition. Review the film and leave your politics at the door.",False
3,8,Interesting examination of an important political figure,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.I may not be familiar with Jacinda Ardern but this documentary is a good examination of Ardern's role and views as a former Prime Minister, and the struggles she encountered and went through in the past. Captured with good footage, direction, and approach, the documentary features a good sense of realism and humane atmospheres. Demonstrating both the political aspect and personal aspects Ardern is facing.The filmmakers are able to humanize Ardern on an emotional level. Being able to understand her more thoroughly and understand why she believed things this way and that way. Ardern might not been a perfect person but her passion and her ambitious views demonstrates how difficult and challenging as a Prime Minister can be.",False
4,10,Wellington streets,aostling-07199,n/a,16/08/2025,"For me this was the perfect movie. From 1971 to 1978 I lived in Wellington, half a mile from Parliament Building (in one direction), and half a mile from Premier House (in another direction) where Jacinda Ardern and Clark took up residence in 2017. When I arrived on those shores there had not yet been a New Zealand feature-length move. How things have changed -- I gazed in wonder at my old Thorndon neighborhood, fifty years older now. As I left the theater I thought that this must be the best of documentaries. Jacinda could be nominated for an Oscar, but that might not be right -- she wasn't acting, she was just being her incredible self.",False
5,10,Unprecedented access,thewisegirl,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very few global leaders would allow themselves to seen so raw and affected over such a long period. And then reflect back on their past so candidly. Hats off to the filmmakers spent years alongside in both the public and private arena. Irrespective of 'left and right' politics, and 'taking sides' this is an insight into what it really means to have the weight of a nation on your shoulders through an unscripted pandemic, the worse terrorist attack a nation has faced, a volcanic eruption, a pregnancy and raising an infant to child, all the while being scrutinised to levels no male politician would ever face.",False
6,10,"A poignant, powerful documentary that made me homesick for a version of New Zealand that feels like it's slipping away.",kiwaussie,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't expect to be so emotional watching this, but it hit me harder than I anticipated. The film captures more than just Jacinda Ardern's time in office - it's a reminder of a leadership style rooted in empathy, clarity, and courage. Watching it made me nostalgic for a country that, in many ways, doesn't feel the same anymore.It's rare to see a political figure portrayed with such honesty and vulnerability, and it only reinforced what I already felt: the world needs more Jacindas. If more leaders approached their role with the compassion and moral backbone that she did, the world would be a profoundly different place.I'm not surprised to see a few low-star ratings from people who likely didn't watch it, or who disagree with her politics but can't articulate why - and tellingly, many of those reviews don't contain a single word of critique. That says it all.This documentary is a moving, thoughtful portrait of a once-in-a-generation leader. I loved it.",False
7,8,Very informative and a great inside look,kryzak-737-655687,n/a,16/08/2025,"Had to write something .I really enjoyed learning about Jacinda, New Zealand's politics, and how the big world events happened for the Kiwis. I'm also shocked by the in moment videos that Jacinda's husband took, which added a lot of insight into how she thinks and reacts to the major events during her tenure.The live Q&A after was also a treat and gave us a little more color on her experience and what she's doing now. I definitely recommend people go watch this and make a judgment for yourself, but one thing for sure, it would not be boring at all.",False
8,9,Moving poignant account of Dame Jacinda Ardeans time as PM of NZ,athenasw-87617,n/a,16/08/2025,"I throughly enjoyed this moving film. In it, is an intimate look into the complexties and challenges of leading a country, while also staying true to yourself and valuing connection, family and doing the right thing.I've long admired Jacinda Ardean's leadership approach, putting people first, consulting with experts and not being afraid to make the tough decisions. Decisions that may not be the most popular, but with all the information at her fingertips, she is equipped with the knowledge to lead. Through it all, she has a thriving family and enviable strong, loving and caring relationship with her husband.Highly recommend!",False
9,2,A Missed Opportunity for Truth,doodah1999,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is quite possibly the worst documentary I've ever seen. Don't waste your time. It plays more like a self-congratulatory PR piece than an honest account. Rather than offering a balanced view, it's just Jacinda Ardern telling the world how kind, caring, and empathetic she supposedly was - a narrative many New Zealanders know doesn't reflect reality. There's no serious scrutiny, no opposing voices, and no acknowledgment of the damage done during her time in office. As a New Zealander myself, I found the whole thing deeply offensive - a tone-deaf attempt to rewrite history. Truly embarrassing stuff.",False

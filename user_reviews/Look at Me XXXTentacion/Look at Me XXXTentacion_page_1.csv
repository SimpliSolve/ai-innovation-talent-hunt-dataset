1,9,Duality Divide: Everybody Dies in Their Nightmares,chriscarlisle25,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a well put together documentary about the troubled artist XXXTENTACION. It covers his ups and downs and will give a lot of people much needed closure. I was a huge X fan who would defend him for a while and I know there are still those who do. This documentary will provide a level of understanding so as not to make judgement calls, but to just know that he was a human being with a multitude of issues and problems. We all need help, and thus made me wish he had lived to get that much needed help and be there for his son. He was still a kid and taken way too soon. He should have been able to grow and atone for his mistakes like everybody (to a certain degree). I appreciate the fact that this doc doesn't attempt to sugar coat and lays out all of the cold hard facts. I also appreciate the emphasis on mental health. We all need it, and it is especially neglected in the Black community. I will try my best to help people in need for the rest of my life if I can because I know there have been times where I have needed it and haven't received it. Such is the case with Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy. He was a troubled youth with the weight of the world on his frail shoulders and nowhere to turn. Let's make sure nobody has to go through that of at all possible!",False
2,9,A balanced look at a controversial artist,levfawzi,n/a,16/08/2025,It found a way to highlight the moments in his career without idolising him as a person. It was able to show him as 'the bad guy' but also showed his redeeming qualities.,False
3,7,Great Documentary about a Legend,basicallyabush,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was was an emotional roller coaster I've been following X's career since 2015 when I was 15 and I know it's clique to say but his music really help me with my feelings of Anxiety depression and anger, Both sides of his music distorted and anger filled and the slow more emotional filled songs really spoke to me at the time and and still today, And even though I was only listening to him for 3 years before his death his music had a big impact on my life and taught me how to express myself and emotions and I'll always love his music for that, Anyway this documentary was really great hearing about his upbringing and Re watching his come up rising from the underground to become one of the biggest rapper in the industry was really great I liked that it didn't shy away from the dark parts of his life with Geneva and showed how he bettered himself before his death, I do think there should of been more time spent with Ski and John and Denzel should of been in there and they left out other parts of his life such as the Jocelyn incident showing how X was definitely tortured soul moulded by his environment and he was a deeply flawed individual who seemed like more of myth and legend after his death who did a lot of bad but also accomplished a lot of good by helping millions of lost people and saving countless lives, By the end of the documentary I was in tears X was the first Famous person who died that truly effected me I remember waking up and seeing the news and going into a depression and it Messed for a while he was the only artist who spoke to me, It's hard to come to terms with this being one of the last forms of media we'll get of X but all I can say is we should all be happy we were able to experience his career and legacy with his short life while he was here if you're a fan of X this documentary was a must watch Long Live Jahseh <3.",False
4,10,Brutally honest story about XXXTENTACION,davidkocarjan666,n/a,16/08/2025,At first I expected this documentary to dodge all of his controversies and overlook the stuff that absolutely should not be overlooked but I'm happy to say that I was wrong. This documentary addresses everything and it's brutally honest about everything. This documentary will show you the true colors of Jahseh Onfroy... The good and the bad. It truly shows how even the most flawed people can change into something good if people give them the opportunity. The documentary finally humanizes the late rapper and it's up to audience if they choose to forgive him or not.,False
5,10,What a journey it's been,kmjbgf,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a fan of X since late 2016 and the evolution this kid has had is stunning. The documentary did a really good job of portraying the energy back then. I just wish there were some more key figures in the doc, like people who were with him in the beginning. Sad to see DJ Scheme and Denzel Curry were not in the documentary for interviews despite being shown in the actual documentary. Hope this doc gives people the same closure i found in watching it. LLJ bro is missed everyday and his fam and fans will keep his music alive.",False
6,n/a,"A talented young man fighting his biggest enemy, himself.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary was honestly amazing in portraying the story of Jahseh Onfroy. He was just a kid when he started getting into trouble that was bigger than himself, serving time as a teenager. There were some really dark parts of the documentary that show a lot of controversial stuff, but it was necessary to fully tell the story of X. Geneva Ayala speaks on how X had allegedly abused her, showing photos of the bruises on her face, which honestly were absolutely awful. Another acquaintance speaks on specific times where Jahseh had drowned Ayala in a bathtub of a motel room, but they still stayed together even after all of that, which really goes to show the influence that loneliness, depression and paranoia have on some peoples souls. In the coming months after X was put in jail for almost a year awaiting trial for the domestic abuse case, he really worked on bettering himself to change his ways of thinking and control his thought processes. X played the role of the villain for a while and he was feared by many at the time, there was a voice recording that was secretly taken of him where he's saying how Ayala is scared shitless of him, and now she will listen to him and not disobey, which truly portrays how messed up he was inside his head. That was honestly the most brutal and emotional part of the documentary, and the rest of the film goes on to speak of his mental state and how he worked to change his ways and mindset. His musical talent on the other hand was one of a kind. He was versatile and could fit into many genres of music. There may never be another like him. His song, Look at Me, blew up while he was in jail. He had rappers like J cole, Kendrick, and many others praising his work. He was in a rap group, Members Only, which was more like a brotherhood to him. These guys told never heard before stories of X, and how they knew of his struggles. Ski mask in particular, was Jah's best friend. They met in jail and made beats and freestyled to them on the inside whilst growing their relationship. Ski was like a brother to X, and was primarily the one who would have to calm him down when things got rough. As time went on, he learned to control his anger and worked on himself mentally. His many changes of hairstyle show this. His mother, Cleopatra Bernard, is one of the main narrators of the film, and as Jahseh's mother, she speaks on how his childhood influenced his actions. She mentions how Dwayne Onfroy, Jahs father, was locked up when he was only 10, and this was when he started acting out and the start of his entire story. He was fatally shot and killed in a failed armed robbery attempt on June 18th, 2018. His death was a shock to the world, a very talented young artist on the come up who's life was taken too soon. Definitely a well-produced, brutal and well-told story of a troubled human. 9/10.",True
7,7,Entertaining but bias documentary.,lelinhobig,n/a,16/08/2025,"In light of the garbage ""films"" that come out, this is a good way to spend 90 minutes of your life.Prior to watching this documentary I have not had heard of XXXTentacion and I came with an open mind. This movie show a glimpse of what is wrong with the world today.I'm not here to pass a judgement on the boy. Watch it and make your own mind up.",False
8,10,"the x documentary basically showed a human soul trying to understand life and had done wrong yes, but to understand that you can change your life style, if you want to strive",naladobawa,n/a,16/08/2025,"The x documentary basically showed a human soul trying to understand life and had done wrong yes, but to understand that you can change your life style, if you want to strive and become a better person it's possible, and a long process, never lose hope .",False
9,10,Good movie,demetriusmcmullan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I heard this movie was going to be released today, so as soon as I woke up I started watching it and learned a lot in doing so. I definitely recommend watching this movie.",False
10,10,Absolutely stunning,wilhelmydillon,n/a,16/08/2025,I am a true believer that he did not assault her but I'm very pleased that they left it open to the viewer to decide without grooming one way or another . Jahseh Onfroy changed so many lives including myself and this documentary was so special . It lived up to every expectation I was hoping for and more . Would rate this documentary higher if it was possible !,False
11,10,Exceeded Expectations,snooker-60297,n/a,16/08/2025,"Explored all sides of Jahseh, the good, the bad, the ugly. I hope it allows people to see who he really was as a person, including the mistakes he made. I also think it's a wake up call, to show how the media will label someone/something as one thing, rather than giving people the whole perspective. :)",False
12,10,MASTERPIECE,antoniomarcosximenes,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows the human side of a person who was a monster for a long time but who became someone amazing, rest in peace X we will always miss you. Despite all the mistakes you were always something supernatural, someone special, an idol. Thank you for saving my life my king. As you say in ""let's pretend we're numb"" I ALWAYS LOVE U!",False
13,9,Truly Human,justinshamoun-61467,n/a,16/08/2025,"A brilliant dive into the beauty and darkness of a revolutionary legacy in an unbelievably wild, yet sympathetic view on one man's journey to identity and redemption. Jahseh gave every bit of himself to the world without thinking twice about the impact that he would be leaving behind for generations to come.His vision was beautifully captured through intimate direction and depth filled focus into a modern icon.",False
14,10,Great Documentary,godlyvo,n/a,16/08/2025,What a great documentary of such a young artist who didn't live out all his dreams.A great artist who was taken away fro mud too soon. May he rest in piece. Anyone will enjoy this documentary of a legend.,False
15,8,Legend Gone Too Soon,big-71730,n/a,16/08/2025,"He suffered from mental illness and got involved in the streets because his pops was locked up and his mom was young and didn't know how to love and raise him, he was trying to right his wrongs and live a normal life, Bro was evolving and becoming a better man and artist. RIP X.",False
16,4,X Was More,LockIsLive,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis did not feel like a documentary about Xxxtentacion but a documentary about his ex girlfriend Geneva and her story of abuse. So many major accomplishments were left out and not talked about. Such as the helping hand challenge, and the countess charity work X did. Dwayne Onfroy (X's Father) was wrongfully defamed by Cleo... The ending felt rushed where X's own son was barely even a focus but just a thrown together last second addition.With that being said, it was enjoyable. Frustrating, sure. I would say it's worth a watch but just be aware that X's story is a whole lot more darker in the beginning, and a whole more beautiful in the ending than this documentary lets on.",True
17,10,"Perfect closure and context to Jahseh's life, passing, and his legacy",woelffel,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary holds nothing back, and gives necessary context on X's life and career. In this, you'll find the truth: the good, the bad, the ugly, but most importantly, the journey he went through as a human being. You understand his motivations, mistakes and how he went about changing himself for the better. It's not about what his past did to him, but what he did with his past. His search for salvation and redemption is inspiring; you feel for him, feel for others involved with him. Seeing Geneva's story be properly told is great and needed; she went through so much, and only now being heard shows how our modern society treats abuse victims. Jahseh was, by no means, a saint. He was a troubled, traumatized soul, that went through, and dealt, much pain on those around him. However, he took a moment to reflect, understand, and change his being. His legacy should be one of repentance, and giving your best to help others. We should see and acknowledge the mistakes, wrongdoings, but also see in XXXTentacion a tale of evolution. The purpose shouldn't be to agree or disagree, but to understand his mind and heart. Everything a documentary should be, especially for a polarizing figure like that of X's; his talent and wit are put on display all throughout, along with his nature and flaws. A great and beautifully put together piece on an artist who has deeply impacted modern music and culture. A must-watch for his fans, or music fans in general. LLJ.",True
18,10,Woah.,sdvfqbtdx,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc went all out to show a full story that I feel no one knew until now. It helped me rekindle my love for X, his story, his music. It helped me look myself in the mirror and not ignore the ugly traits but to focus on them and work on myself for the people
I love.",False
19,10,Touching documentary,mdseal-43395,n/a,16/08/2025,"XXXTENTACION played a big part in my personal life growing up, any sort of trauma or sadness I would listen to his music, he always had that affect on people that they felt comfort in his music just as he intended. People often get the wrong impression but his real fans really feel the things he felt, this documentary perfectly portrays his life and gives an unbiased view of his upbringing his controversy and MOST IMPORTANTLY his turn around, so moving and an emotional rollercoaster, will truly show people he was a good man at heart. Couldn't have been done better.",False
20,10,very talented and sad story,wolfbuster,n/a,16/08/2025,I love the fact that they chose to put EVERYTHING including the bad parts in it and how he was trying to change his life. I do not agree with the stuff he did and i think it was very wrong but he was still a very good artist and helped me get through bad times. LLJ.,False
21,10,IMPACTFUL,utraabel,n/a,16/08/2025,I feel like this was a very impactful film in all honesty from the mental health stand point to just everything. Very strong and emotional film overall. I feel like i learned a tremendous amount about XXXTENTACION and Jahseh Onfroy as seperate personas.,False
22,10,I loved it so much,pchanadereso,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerIt was very good to watch I miss X so much It truly showed who he was and how he was trying to change. I wish he was still here because I would of loved to see him evolve and see where his fame would of gotten him right now.,True
23,10,Honest look at who x was as a person,fwxxpdvf,n/a,16/08/2025,I appreciate this documentary because it gives me a better look at the man that has gotten me through many hard times and helps me relate to him more. This documentary helps me realize that everybody has their personal hardships and life is all about getting through these times and bettering yourself from your experiences.,False
24,10,Great documentary,dkpmsbq,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was good man I really liked the storytelling it h
Showed his bad side and how he wanted to grow as a person and how he changed kids life when people were going through hard times and he was an incredible person.",False
25,9,Great and impactful film about XXXTENTACION and his life story,CameronF305,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I do feel there were a few minor missing pieces to be desired in this film - like interviews with DJ Scheme, Denzel Curry, and a bigger emphasis on his change later in life including his charity work - I honestly think this documentary really exceeded my expectations and really told the real story of XXXTENTACION. The film covers Jahseh Onfroy's entire life, the good, the bad, and the ugly. They did it in such a way where you felt like you were there. Things get very dark, especially early on, you get to see the environment he grew up around, the crimes he committed, his influences, his mistakes, and his growth. As the film goes on through his life and fame, they cover how people can change, they show the development and hardships of Jahseh to show his change as a person as well as his positive impact on his community towards the end of his life. My biggest worry of this film going in was how they were going to treat the abuse allegations, I was worried they were either going to try to avoid them completely or pick sides. Neither of those things happened, the full perspective of the case was shown as best as it could've been in a very honest manor. They were able to finally humanize him while still understanding he made mistakes, human mistakes, albeit bad mistakes. If you can handle a dark story its a great watch and I strongly recommend it to anyone who has even heard of XXXTENTACION. Jahseh was taken far too soon and he was really growing.",False

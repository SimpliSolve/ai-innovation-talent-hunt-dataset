1,10,Haven't laughed so hard since My Big Fat Greek Wedding,dadswhodj,n/a,17/08/2025,"Truly unique and family friendly comedy. Zarna is a trailblazer and her honesty and character shine through here. Her ability to captivate the audience for a full hour set is unparalleled as this is her first comedy special, I was truly amazed. I hope this is a trend and we get to see much more of what Zarna can bring.What I love about Zarna is that she can keep the whole family entertained and her jokes appeal not only to all immigrants but reflect the modern day USA, but with positive energy.A refreshing and honest spin on life, love, parenting, family. Zarna will make you laugh non stop!",False
2,1,"Zarna, thoda toh funny karna",rahulvaidya055,n/a,17/08/2025,"I watched this comedy special after reading ""good things"" about it on the interwebz. But my mistake was that I believed the ""good things"" that I read. It's the same stereotypical hogwash that has been rehashed again and again and again in different specials from Asian comedians. The only difference is that the content has been tailored for an Indian audience. For an hour that I spent on watching this generic rehashed content, I was still optimistic and waited for ""jokes"" and I did laugh at a couple of them. The rest of the time I was looking at the screen with a straight face and sometimes with an expression that screamed loudly ""Where funny?"".",False
3,9,Loved it!,alexisvandenbos,n/a,17/08/2025,"Thought it was fresh and funny. Different perspective coming from an immigrant parent --not just from an Indian kid born in the US.Although I'm somewhat familiar with Indian culture from friends and acquaintances, besides finding
Zarna Garg humorous, she was authentic. I learned a substantial amount more about subtle aspects of Indian culture and family. And, it put some of my previous understanding in a new light.So glad I happened upon this Special on Amazon Prime. It is 67 minutes watching worth watching. I will watch it again. Rare for me to watch anything twice.Hoping any future new material will stay as fresh and authentic.",False
4,10,Ignore the Haters! This is GOOD COMEDY!,valpia-00218,n/a,17/08/2025,"I was definitely apprehensive. I thought I wouldn't relate to her. I was wrong.Zarna is down-to-earth FUNNY! You end up laughing at her, laughing with her, and eventually laughing at ourselves! Imagine sitting down with your favorite, funny Aunt. That's how the setting seemed to me. She is not afraid to address what some would consider ""taboo""!Nothing offensive, really. Jokes are fair & funny... and no one is spared (not even her family)!Be aware that some ""haters"" who want to bring her down will say otherwise. Don't let them deter you from watching!Keep it up, Zarna! We need more comedians like you! üëçüèΩ üëèüèΩüëèüèΩ",False
5,2,Don't waste your time,thisisdejavu,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is one of the worst comedy shows ever. It is extremely boring. The jokes have nothing new and you would not even realize that it's time to laugh, if not for the crowd in the show. It made me wonder who sponsored this person got the show considering there are so many other way better comedians out there and struggling to get noticed. The other thing is her accent. Apparently she is an 'immigrant'. She is confused about her accent. Most times her accent is Indian (which is fine) but at other times she tries real hard to pull off an American accent. Oh well, I watched only about 10 min, the last few min went in writing thus review. Stay clear, safe time.",False
6,10,My favorite one in a billion MOM,mjken-70368,n/a,17/08/2025,"It's a pleasure to watch Zarna on the big screen. I saw her in person about a month ago in NJ and it was awesome both times!!! I can't tell you enough that Zarna will bring a smile to your face even on the difficult days! If you haven't seen the Amazon show, watch it and get your popcorn ready! Great time and watch her on insta too! I love the parts with her mother in law and it will make you roll with laughter and I really enjoy meeting the family in the end of the special. Moms need to watch Zarna to make life a bit lighter and fun!I hope that this is the first of many specials on Amazon with Zarna!",False
7,10,"Watch out world, Indian mommy is here!!",reemakoul,n/a,17/08/2025,"This had me and my family in splits. So relatable and true. Who knew that the ""impossible to please overbearing Indian parent's"" regular everyday mundane demanding tactics can be so funny. But apparently they are, when Zarna narrates. She is raw, honest and extremely funny.The bit about eldest son/daughter is so funny. Watched her live and she took it to another level. Eldest boy is the prince until a single child walks into the room, then entire dynamics change. Lol.Loved the set and her delivery. She has kept it simple, yet so funny. Loved every bit of this show and surely everyone will.Watch it with your family and enjoy!",False
8,2,Maybe I Missed Something,lewismccoyjr,n/a,17/08/2025,"I've watched all kinds of comedy shows from all kinds of different comedians from all over the world. I was excited at first, because the audience was so energetic when she came out on stage. Zarna seemed very engaged with the audience, and I think Zarna was very enthusiastic in telling her jokes. But, the show progressively got more boring as time went on. I don't think it's a cultural disconnect because I've seen comedians from different cultures that were really funny even though I knew very little about their culture. I just think her delivery needs some work. This comedy show just did not resonate with me.",False
9,10,Great special by a very unique comedian,jocelynchia-38811,n/a,17/08/2025,"Love Zarna! Well written special and her delivery makes it even funnier - that yoga pose bit omg!!I've enjoyed watching her live, and I enjoyed seeing her put all her material together into one seamless special. She is overall very wholesome but at times she went a little edgy, which was a very pleasant surprise!Knowing her backstory of how she even became a comedian while in her 40s makes her all the more inspiring. (She talks about it in Mike Birbiglia's podcast)For her debut special to already be this good, I can't even imagine how good her next special will be. I'm already looking forward to seeing it!",False
10,1,It's not funny,anandtyagi,n/a,17/08/2025,"The show is not funny tbh. I started watching and had to leave midway because it's really pathetic. The comedian needs to find some really good jokes. The jokes she had were also inappropriate for a specific religion. This is not acceptable because that faith is already facing hatred. With these pathetic acts you're making it okay for people to Target one specific religion whereas they wouldn't touch another religion because they know the consequences. Targeting a peaceful religion via pathetic jokes is not okay. The comedian needs to work hard on her content it seems, on herself also probably.",False
11,10,Edgy and unexpected,hellzinger248,n/a,17/08/2025,"The ""9 dollar in my pocket, but 10,000 in the bank joke"" was the perfect start to a great set. It was in few words hilarious, edgy and totally unexpected. I didn't expect so many dark jokes but they were tasteful and funny. She talked about some serious topics too but it was really graceful. Loved that she has her Indian identity mingled with her American one. It also takes a lot of guts to stereotype yourself and make jokes on them. Her edginess makes her more loveable. The Fifty shades of grey joke had me laugh out loud for a while.I hope to see more from her in the future and not just in comedy specials but also roasts and talk shows or reality shows.",False
12,1,What?,lesliepurchase,n/a,17/08/2025,"Zarna Garg is coming to my hometown in August as an opening act for Anthony Jeselnik so I was curious. Bad decision. The content is littered with what are apparently ""inside jokes"" for those familiar with Indian culture. Aunties, Hinduism, arranged marriages, shades of brown skin, etc. I was familiar with some of her references but didn't find them funny. When the audience laughed, I had to keep going back to listen to the ""joke"" again because I seemed to have missed a lot that cracked up the audience. Brutal. And enough with the white yoga jokes already. Overdone. Like Covid jokes. She's likeable enough - she's just not funny. Not once. Well, maybe once. In the entire hour. Don't waste your time.",False
13,10,So much funnier than the audience let on !!,wagnerkimbrel,n/a,17/08/2025,"Namaste... Very funny hunny ! Wonderful to hear cultural humor that was just plainly funny.It was especially pleasant to watch someone discuss things without have to be careful of the audience being too sensitive. It was like years ago when you could just TALK without having to watch what you say so as not to offend anyone.Most people in the US came from immigrant families, although most have forgotten this.It was such a wonderful gesture to introduce each family member. Just beautiful to share what means the most to someone in a happy way.This gal is a great watch and we're looking forward to her next Netflix special !",False
14,1,Poorly written,kjasmeet-52145,n/a,17/08/2025,"I'm sorry and I'm probably going to sound like a hater but the show was so mid and derogatory.It is so obvious that the comedian has left India for so long and sees it still as a country what it was maybe 20-25 years ago. It's upsetting and unfunny.Before some clowns read it and get salty over the review, this comes from from someone who isn't in India herself so I could definitely understand some references but were they funny? Absolutely not!I would strongly recommend if you understand Hindi, watch stand-ups of Zakir, Anubhav Bassi, Krunal and so on and compare the content yourself. It's not like they don't offend people by some jokes but at least, it's funny ffs.",False
15,10,Highly Recommended--Very Funny!,alisonpassino,n/a,17/08/2025,"If you follow Auntie Zarna, you absolutely will love her special, One In A Billion. Witty, smart, charming and she proves comedy doesn't have to be raunchy to get a laugh. It was so great to hear her takes on immigrants, white people, yoga, religion and her family! If you haven't heard the story of how she became a stand up, you should absolutely find the podcast with her and Mike Bribiglia--you'll for sure bawl your eyes out. Her Instagram account is one worth following whether she's feeding Zoya pineapple rinds or giving her wonderful husband the side eye while holding a knife. Zarna is hilarious and all her success is well deserved!",False
16,10,An endearing love letter,rpant-11336,n/a,17/08/2025,"I haven't been to India in the last 4 years but I felt like home while watching Zarna's, or should I say Jharna, special.Amidst on point sarcasm, callbacks and running gags about her family, there was an underlying kindness. The perseverance showed, the hunger came through. I have been following Zarna through my work at iRelaunch and her story about her kids being instrumental in her relaunch after a 16 year career break still gets me.I loved the liberally sprinkled Hindi words in the stand up. I am going to use the Logic as superpower line on my husband forever now.And lastly I am a Hindu lite and I did not know it. Thank you for making the world a better place Zarna. Onwards and Upwards!",False
17,1,I wish I had smiled,Vetrrich_Chelvan,n/a,17/08/2025,"Prime video filled my YouTube shorts feed with videos from this show, I loved the little snippets so I decided to watch the whole show but as I started watching this, thanks to Zarna, for like every 10 minutes I yawned.It felt like Zarna had mistook ranting for comedy and used the audience to listen to her rambling just for a price. The jokes were dry and most of them were about how she is an immigrant, it just felt like a show for sharing inside jokes among non resident Indians.I have seen better comedy I have to say and this 'Indian Aunty' talk Zarna is going for isn't going to enough in future.",False
18,10,A great comedy special,nehap-79388,n/a,17/08/2025,A great comedy special. Watched it a few times. Very funny and relatable for all ages. Definitely worth a watch for a good laugh. Loved seeing her family at the end since she talks about them during her comedy. Need to meet her mother in law one day! Can't wait to see her live one day too! Hoping she adds more cities to her tour.So happy she got a comedy special of her own because she killed it! Can't wait till she gets another special soon too. Until then will catch her on Instagram and Tiktok. I send all her videos to my fiends and brother. Makes me laugh throughout my day too.Go Zarna!!!!!,False
19,1,Just avoid this,gautam4937,n/a,17/08/2025,"The show had simply no funny content. It became so frustrating that I'd to stop watching mid way. Felt like simply wasting my precious time. Also all her content wrt country, marriages, aunties etc all seem 25yrs old. She has no idea how developed India is now. Just for the sake of content, the creator has misused her freedom of speech without any fact checks. For standups, content study and background work are equally important than stage performance to connect with worldwide audience. Looks like the creator cannot even connect with her own diaspora. Very annoying and torturous show. After a while her fake accent and tone started burning my ears. Anyways, just ignore this mistake.",False
20,9,How to make fun of yourself,thejdrage,n/a,17/08/2025,"I decided to watch Zarna Garg because I had nothing to lose, except a few minutes time. I give comedians 10 minutes to give me at least one chortle or laugh - or a damn good message. If they can't do it in the first 10 minutes, I go on to something else.She started off with chortles and giggles at the very beginning and they didn't end until the credits rolled.She makes fun of herself as a failed lawyer, her family (don't we all?), her mother country (shouldn't we all?), and of how Americans raise their kids. Those were painful laughs because of how painfully true they are.She reminds me of an Indian Mrs. Hughes.OH! And her act is ""clean""! Enjoy! And find yourself in some of what she says. I promise it won't hurt.",False
21,1,"Unfunny, Uninteresting, Unfunny : Overacting trying to be edgy",midxnightvibes,n/a,17/08/2025,"Dont waste a second of your life on this brain dumbing, stomach wrenching gager, 13 year old can make a better joke in their free time.Worst show, worse jokes, and a Loud overactor!Worst show, worse jokes, and a Loud overactor!Worst show, worse jokes, and a Loud overactor!One of the worst female indian standup comics to ever exist, and she tries soo hard to be funny and edgy can make some weirdos laugh, but this is a insult to actual funny female indian comics who dont get a platform. Garg is one of those people in school who will make fun of the weak kid in the class in front of everyone just be let in the cool club, but she fails in comedy club thats for sure.",False
22,10,SO GOOD!!,vietvo-03070,n/a,17/08/2025,"Probably one of the funniest things I've seen in a while.I was told by several of my friends to tune in and watch Zarna Garg: ONE IN A BILLION. I had seen her on social media through tiktok and Instagram and thought she was funny.......and guess what??? She is HILARIOUS!..
Her content on tiktok is quick, smart and funny.Her special ONE IN A BILLION is on the long form and STILL IS JUST AS FUNNY as Her short form comedy on social media is easily translates very well on this platform.Highly recommended! Especially if you grew up with ethnic parents. She is DEFINITELY one yo keep an eye on.",False
23,10,This is funnier than her Instagram reels!,aparnasarin,n/a,17/08/2025,"Sometimes I find some of her jokes cliched, especially if you know exactly the kind of life, relatives, and world she's talking about. However, there is literally no other comedian, at least not female, talking about these things. And they're all true and therefore even funnier. This set was genuinely funny in many parts, and entertaining. If that's not enough for you - it's hard not to be inspired by her life story and everything that brought her to being a female comedian in her mid 40s, and so quickly headlining comedy clubs in NYC, and now a special on Amazon Prime. Her most enviable feature - how proud her family is of her. Worth watching.",False
24,10,One in a Billion was all I hoped it would be!,miapia-40941,n/a,17/08/2025,"This show was so funny. Zarna has cool story how a lawyer, turn stay at home mom, became a comedy sensation. I have been following Zarna for awhile and loved that in her special she continues to poke fun at herself and her family. If you follow her you know her family is ""all in"" for the fun shenanigans! I really loved how her family joined her at the end of the show and took a bow. Anyone offended by her jokes about her kids represents everything wrong with our world right now and needs to lighten up a bit!! The audience loved it all and continued to get more and more engaged. The hour flew by and I could have enjoyed another hour. Zarna is smart, funny and I am looking forward to more specials.",False
25,10,Laugh out loud: Truly 1 in 1000000000!,kmziet,n/a,17/08/2025,"You don't need to be a STEM major to enjoy the comedy stylings of Zarna, but it can't hurt! Her unique story telling style and command of the stage will have you laughing the whole time! I really enjoyed learning and understanding her point of view on parenting and careers. She makes the struggles of a first generation immigrant experience heart warming and funny. I was fortunate to catch her show in New York a few months ago, and this special is even better! Give this woman her own television series!! The world needs diverse voices to help share the human experience, and Zarna is indeed one in a billion!",False

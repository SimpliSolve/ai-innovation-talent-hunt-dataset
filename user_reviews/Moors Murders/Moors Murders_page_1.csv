1,7,"Interesting documentary but the ""experts"" who analyse the horror are not terribly insightful",felice-witch-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWell I'm only half way through this series but there are a few things that really annoy me. I'll just mention the one I've just seen. A woman talks about one of the victims explaining she agreed to help Myra ""find a lost glove"" which was a ruse and she was tragically kidnapped and murdered. The woman describes this young girl aa naïve. Seriously why was it naïve to help someone look for a glove??? Especially as she knew Myra who was her friend's sister. I think this is victim shaming. In fact if that girl had told her friends she refused because she thought she would be kidnapped and murdered I think people would have likely thought her paranoid.",True

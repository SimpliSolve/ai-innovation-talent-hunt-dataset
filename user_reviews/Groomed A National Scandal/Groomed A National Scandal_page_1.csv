1,10,"Brave Journalism, abysmal, sickening story.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Without making a political point, I didn't think this was the kind of documentary that Channel Four would be making these days.Five women, five remarkable women, whom I applaud for appearing and sharing their stories. I've seen Chantelle do a few interviews recently, remarkable woman.Absolutely remarkable, this was one of the most unbelievably harrowing and heart breaking things I've watched in years, it had me in tears, listening to the personal accounts from these incredible, brave and abysmally treated victims.Politicians should be made to sit and watch this, especially after The Government's decision to axe a national enquiry. When you think that this is still going on, it really should unsettle every single person.I felt sick whilst watching it, it's been a long time since a documentary had that impact on me.10/10.",False

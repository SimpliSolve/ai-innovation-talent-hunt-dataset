1,1,Would be nice see what less privilege women think of this movie,elinmohlander,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a movie with women in their own small bubble that is working for Trump and are just privileged (Wisteria Lane). One told her story on how she was saved by Trump from poverty (guess their take on diversity). They want you to think that Trump is speaking to all women and it really cracked me up. This is pure propaganda for the Trump campaign.
I wanted to give it a chance but it was also super hard to get access to. I had to rent it and create an account on Vimeo instead of getting free access to it in an easy way. Not any real facts, just opinions about what they think about Trump and how wrong the media is in their coverage. Same story we always hear from this side, nothing new or genuine about it and definitely no presentation of what he really accomplished for women in general, any laws that he passed or anything to make our life better. But the women in the film seemed like nice women, just like all of us are.",False
2,10,Awesome film,kbrun-76199,n/a,16/08/2025,You get a better understanding into who Donald Trump is and how much he loves our country. He has given up so much to make our country great again. Highly recommend you watch it!,False
3,10,A glimpse into the lives surrounded by our President,riley1709,n/a,16/08/2025,This great film brings its audience into the lives of the many women surrounding President Trump. They tell their great stories which gives their audience a deeper look into how much the media trys to tear down our President. Great film and I highly recommend to anyone that has mixed feelings about President Trump.,False
4,10,All women should watch! And men!,cherylynnedecarlo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a well done and authentic view of the women who work for Trump. It gives a peek into Trump and his team which is genuine and even touching at times. The clips of Va. women for Trump were especially telling. Certainly a different view from what is portrayed on TV and really impossible to refute. If one would dare to watch something about someone they abhor, the lens they have used to make their decision may be found to have been distorted all along.",False
5,10,Authentic and interesting Interviews about genuine women around Trump,nyobatusa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed this documentary for its authentic interviews with the kind of women that are examples of professional moms and strong fighters in what they believe in. I was a bit hesitant to watch but I am glad I did because it showed that the kind of women that I can relate to still exist. Empowered women can still be graceful, act like ladies without the drama, smugs and faces we see on the media today. Also, the director shared his own story which is very moving.",False
6,10,The a Trump you should know,mrs-tiru,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an amazing insight in the life of Trump and his political family. I respect people that don't like him, it their choice, but in order to be vocal about your hate you need to know your enemy first. So, watch this movie and then tell to the world why you don't like it.",False
7,10,Hear from a group of women whose voices are omitted by the mainstream media,graciemaebv,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very, very interesting and rare content in this documentary.
I say rare because there are so many conservative women out there whose speech and perspective are forgotten and sometimes even suppressed in mainstream media and Hollywood narratives. If it is ever present, it is twisted or edited. The consumers of mainstream have very little exposure to the viewpoints of those who subscribe to any branch of American conservative philosophy. You don't have to be a supporter to be curious to understand or even hear a different viewpoint (in its full version). At the very least it will give you some clarity, knowledge of what you are up against and an opening to conversation. And we would be less divided.",False
8,10,Finally - a real story about DT!!!!,ddamo-13945,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerGreat story about the 45 president of the United States. Honest and real from beginning to end. I paid the $5 to watch it and felt like I was being told the truth about who and what DT is.,True
9,10,Great!!!!,jordanpaulbogart,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie shows the human side of the president we haven't seen because of a bias, partisan media who has set out to create a false narrative about him. I recommend watching this regardless of your opinion of Donald trump to hear the real true life stories from people who actually know him.",False
10,10,Great inside look. Very inspiring. Causes you to stop and think why anyone would dislike him. It can only mean they are evil.,hhope-42528,n/a,16/08/2025,"Judging by the fact the media is 24/7 anti Trump. If you dont have the good sense to go and see who owns the worldwide media, youd think he was bad. If you didnt have thr good sense to look at statistics youd think he was doing a bad job. This inside look into his personal side shows that hes just as good a person as all of us try to be when we are doing the right thing. Its even more apparent now that if you hate him, you are led by emotions and not logic or common sense. If you support career politicians who have been there 12 xs longer than Trump but have accomplished nothing for America then you are incompetent thinking all of a sudden they are going to start. Watching the russia collusion scam as well as the impeachment scam as well as the double standard when it comes to the left its obvious we are under attack as a nation and its going to take someone they cannot bribe or buy (which is why the 24/7 hatred in media) to stop career politicians from making us their heavily taxes serfs.",False
11,10,Trump 2020,lynneajones95,n/a,16/08/2025,Loved watching! Cannot wait to see more of what he will do for our nation!,False
12,10,Honest accounts,skitofit,n/a,16/08/2025,"The media loves a smear piece, but this is an interesting look from the ignored women closest to trump.",False
13,10,A must see for everyone,awspringerdmd,n/a,16/08/2025,Pray for our country. Show the truth and trust in God that it will all be revealed.,False

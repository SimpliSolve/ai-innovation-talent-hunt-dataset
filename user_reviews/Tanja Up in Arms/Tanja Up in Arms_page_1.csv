When Tanja Nijmeijer was targeted by the media a few years later, she developed more and more into the international face and voice of the FARC...Marcel Mettelsiefens film strives for great balance. The historical development of Colombia offers interesting insights into a country that is developing more and more into a cultural place of longing thanks to the music of reggaeton.Whether Tanja Nijmeijers political development is credible is left to the judgment of the audience. Thats how it should be with a good documentary.",True

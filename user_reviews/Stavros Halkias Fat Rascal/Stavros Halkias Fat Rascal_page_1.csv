1,8,"Very good! Dirty but likeable, common themes but unique perspective",seanorafferty,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you have a silly side, if you just wanna laugh, I recommend this special. It isn't about some big political issue, he doesn't pontificate about social issues or the future of his country, he's just funny, silly, and tells good stories. I love his vibe and he has good comedic timing. Relatable, but maybe more for a younger audience like under 40. He has a really funny self awareness and most of it is pretty self deprecating.The material itself is very original despite talking about some common general themes like airport experiences and gaining weight. However his perspective and ability to work blue while still being likeable make it unique.",False
2,8,Clever and well delivered,johny21,n/a,16/08/2025,"This guy is very funny, let's admit it! When I bumped on this, I didn't know what to expect. I am Greek, so I thought I must give this guy a try. And believe me, what a treat that show was! Stavros is funny and his set is strong throughout the 50 minutes and very well delivered! He is attacking himself with no mercy and the audience is loving him.I don't know if he is American or Canadian and where this show was filmed, but I sure know that if he decides to cross the Atlantic for a tour in Europe, people here will love him!Well done Stavros, keep up the spirit and never forget your Greek roots!",False
3,10,Loved it,mickeyadamo,n/a,16/08/2025,We didnt realize this was recently released and looking for some late night comedy were pretty impressed with the routine. Stavros Halkias I am not sure which comedian he is connected with but am pretty sure hes been in the scene for a while. We enjoyed the light humor of his routine as well as the faces and his mannerisms which kind of add a second layer of light hearted comedy. I think it was a good divergence from most comedic approaches especially those which try to bang their heads against political atmospheres. This was more goofy jokes and vibing with the atmosphere at the venue. Would recommend!,False
4,4,Truly dissapointing,lookinfan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stavros is one of my favorite stand up comedians and I really love his style but, this one was surprsingly bad.Very lazy, unprepared and not funny.Check his special that is for free on Youtube which was very funny, witty, sharp and really spot on and then compare it to this Netflix special.It's like a different level of comedy and I would rate that 10/10, but this was just dissapointing.What did I expect to see? I do not know. Maybe a bomb special and not him bombing on his first official big thing.I hope to see better things in the future because I truly enjoy his comedy and many of his takes on life and society in general.",False
5,10,Really funny,dluxen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Given I saw him on this Fat Rascal tour in Ft Lauderdale and kinda heard most of this material, it's still really funny. Highly recommend this special and the comedians in general. Maybe it's because I'm from Baltimore, so he's kind of my guy, but he cracks me up. This thing is saying I need to write a bunch of more characters so here I go. I must really like this comedian to go through all this effort now I'm using talk to text because typing was getting really annoying stavi you are really funny you're the man dog. And that's all I have to say about that. Except one more thing, and that thing is this.",False
6,2,This didn't make me laugh...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stumbling upon the 2023 stand-up comedy special ""Stavros Halkias: Fat Rascal"" by random chance, whilst perusing the comedy catalogue on Netflix, and never having heard about Stavros Halkias before, of course I opted to sit down and watch the show. I had zero expectations, of course.55 minutes later, I wasn't even brought to a single laugh. His comedy style and the contents of the jokes was just a swing and a miss for me, and it didn't match my sense of humor at all. And the way he was goofing around and laughing at his own contents just didn't really impress me.Stavros Halkias was sort of lacking an interesting on-stage presence. He was a bit bland and felt sluggish to look at, whereas many other comedians are like bursting with energy, bouncing around on the stage and including the audience into the show. Here, not so much.I can't claim to have been entertained by the ""Stavros Halkias: Fat Rascal"" comedy special, and I am definitely not rushing out to get to know more about this particular comedian, or watch any more of his shows, if he have any. This was not my cup of tea.My rating of ""Stavros Halkias: Fat Rascal"" lands on a two out of ten stars.",False

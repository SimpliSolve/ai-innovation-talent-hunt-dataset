1,10,D-Day is amazingly beautiful album,dollseavlive,n/a,15/08/2025,This Documentary gives a closer glimpse of all the hard work and struggle behind every single track.. The efforts being put behind all the tracks which sum up into a whole album... Loaded with different emotions and feelings... It's really great to see all these stories and experience through this documentary... Thanks everyone whoever puts efforts and work in this project... And Suga did a great work by representing his whole journey of making this album in these few minutes documentary... It's not an easy job to do so. But they still made this possible... So i am grateful to all of them.....,False
2,10,Masterpiece!,anaaannya,n/a,15/08/2025,"What do you do after all your dreams come true? When you're sitting atop the highest peak of a mountain, where do you even look to keep going?""SUGA: Road To D-day"" is an exploration of adulthood and success as much as a behind-the-scenes look into Min Yoongi's (AgustD aka SUGA of BTS) music process and discovering D-Day's sonic story. Yoongi admits in this truthful documentary that he believes one becomes an adult when one stops dreaming.After watching it, I'm left with feelings of admiration and respect. It simply confirmed again why I madly love and respect this MAN! While dreaming has always been BTS' motto, I can only imagine the emotional weight of one of its members explicitly admitting he might not have any dreams left. The dreams, desires, fear, need to create, uncertainty and negative thoughts, detachment from everything, appreciation, and, at the same time, wisdom that he has gained over the years - he's a genuine artist and human being. It's a joy to watch him go through each step that led to the creation of the ""D-Day"" album. His simple, warm, genuine, and direct tone added to the experience's profundity and enjoyment. Yoongi is like a child's genuine smile and a long hug from a guardian angel, always by our side when we need him. Genuinely and Sincerely.By the end of the documentary, Yoongi laments the pressure we put on ourselves due to time and age. In his opinion, focusing too much on finding meaning in the past, present and future is a recipe for torment. Rather than focusing on things we can't control, Yoongi proposes an alternative: Accept life's tide as it comes. Don't try to predict where it'll go. Instead, let's float on it while we can and enjoy the view. It's a rare way of thinking in an entertainment industry that constantly pushes artists to burnout.While it may seem impossible to relate to a world-famous star, ""SUGA: Road To D-Day"" demonstrates otherwise. We not only meet the artist on this journey, but we also see the person behind the music taking over the world. That person is just as lost as we're and trying to find his reason for being as time passes. That person simply wants to do what he loves & it's a delight to see that part of his life.Stream it on Weverse or Disney+!",False
3,10,A real and honest documentary.,mariaalbastru,n/a,15/08/2025,"A real and honest documentary. The feelings I'm left with after watching this documentary are admiration and respect. It was simply confirmed to me again and again: wow, this is why I love and adore this man, Min Yoongi. The sincerity with which he creates and speaks every time, shows you how human he is, how much he is just like us. The dreams, the desires, the fear, the need to create, the uncertainty and the negative thoughts, the detachment from everything, the appreciation and at the same time, the wisdom that he acquired throughout these years. For me, he is a genuine artist and human being. It was a real joy and curiosity to see him go through every process that led to the creation of the D-Day album. His simple voice made the experience even more profound and enjoyable for me. It has a warm and real, direct tone. Yoongi is like the sincere smile of a child and the long hug of a guardian angel, who is always there by your side when you need him. Genuine. Human. Sincere.",False
4,10,If you love music this is for you!,nessg-61354,n/a,15/08/2025,This was great insight into an album that was truly amazing. Watching him create these songs you get an even deeper understanding of these songs that are already very vulnerable. I didn't know much about the album when I watched this but I am a fan now. I think anyone who has an interest in music would enjoy this. You get a behind view of a year in the life of Min Yoongi. Stage names of Suga and Agust D a member of BTS. He is also a award winning music produce. His deep love of music is shown throughout. This is the making of the final album before mandatory military service. All music lovers must watch!,False
5,10,Amazing artist,adorablemc-87892,n/a,15/08/2025,It's nice to see an artist gives his all to his craft. It's not common for artists to do every song from A to Z. He is one of the artists who debuted from long time ago and kept on giving the same passion for his songs. Not only that he also treat his fans in best form. He has ten songs on his album dday with each song being fully produced by him and each contain a meaningful message to the listeners. I advise giving his album a listen. Once you listen to a single song you will feel his deep love and passion for his songs and career. He made me wish to learn music and participate in it. The best artist ever for me.,False
6,10,Fascinating look behind the scenes!!,klarstrom,n/a,15/08/2025,I loved this documentary! It was fascinating to get to peek behind the curtain of Yoongis creative process and getting to see him both struggle and finding new sides of himself. I don't think you need to be a fan of k-pop to enjoy this docu!That he's a super hard worker is something that has been the butt of many inside jokes so that wasn't anything new. This gave a new understanding of how much of himself he puts into his work and the long process it takes to create an album like D-day. That he has completed a trilogy whilst also being a very active member in the worlds largest boyband/k-popband/music phenomenon is astounding.I hope more people watches this.,False
7,10,"full of humanity, emotions and show the real person min yoongi",minderby,n/a,15/08/2025,"Since the movie starts you can see it's transparent, he isn't the idol SUGA, he is Min Yoongi, the man.I've never see before the process of making music, and certainly his process is original and take time, because yes, art takes times to be created
In this times, it's hard to find real musicians, those who create his own art from the beginning, he is one of these rare musicians in this times, in this documentary he showed us his process and his struggles while created the masterpiece that DDAY is.We can take a look at his thoughts, he loves music, create music and that's what an artist is.",False
8,10,Insightful SUGA Documentary,jenngutz,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerGreat documentary! It felt like I was going through a journey with the artist as he created the album that would conclude his Agust D trilogy. It was really nice to see him in that process and to listen to his thoughts and what he felt as he wrote & created each song that made up his D-DAY album. The live performances were really cool to have in there, they felt like chapters of a book. He's a really great live performer. I loved seeing him connect with the great Mr. Sakamoto who was someone really important to Yoongi's journey as an artist. It was great to see him honor Mr. Sakamoto and to see Mr. Sakamoto praise SUGA's artistry. May he rip. Just like the album D-DAY, this documentary feels like triumph after the struggle against one's self. I recommend it!",True
9,10,An honest look into an Artist's life,imdbfan-8985519122,n/a,15/08/2025,"I knew nothing about SUGA when I watched this movie and I can simply describe it as perfect. Every documentary on an artist I've watched before has tried to push some narrative but 'Road to D-day' felt honest. A rapper who has made it but doesn't know what makes him happy. It's so raw and fresh, and sad...Artist documentaries often serve as an introduction to the artist and their work but not 'Road to D-day'. He is too reserved for me to know him and yet he comes across as such a warm and comforting figure you can listen to in your hard times.",False

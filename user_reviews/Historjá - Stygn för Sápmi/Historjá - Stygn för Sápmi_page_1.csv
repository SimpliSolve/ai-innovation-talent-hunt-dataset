1,10,Wonderful ode to the Sami,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis unique and ever impressive drama documentary, is ever recommended and very much deserving of its recognition across the ever poignant and impressive Swedish filmography. Definitely a highlight of the year.Through rather interesting cutting and editing, the Sami people of Sweden are explored and given en indepth image across the historical, and contemporary landscape - the issues that are still prominent today, indeed a very nicely paced, cut and edited affair.Very impressive in terms of cinematograhpy, lightning and imagery. Very beautifully put together film, indeed.Overall, definitely a very interesting outlook, that I would very much recommend. It might prove rather eye-opening!",True
2,4,Exotic topic - but not very good,vinterfritt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yet another of those tedious films depicting indigenous people as poor victims of the so called ""civilisation"" - the white man is to blame for everything that has gone wrong with with the traditional lifestyle of this people.For some reason indigenous people are always depicted as having a special gift that ""civilised"" people lack - they can talk to Mother Earth and understand what is wrong. Even the change of climate is an issue here - and of course the white man is to blame for it. It's also interesting that they mean that they have the right to the land - but suddenly it's said that the land is not theirs - they are just borrowing it.Furthermore, I'd call it hypocrisy when you are able to use modern inventions like snowmobiles, quad bikes and helicopters in order to maintain the ancestor's way of living - and you're still opposing to the modern society. In my opinion one must make a choice - adapt to new times or live like the ancestors did hundred of years back; which would mean not relying on modern technology.",False

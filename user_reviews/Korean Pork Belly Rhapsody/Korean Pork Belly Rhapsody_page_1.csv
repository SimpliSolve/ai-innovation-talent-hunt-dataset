2,10,HUNGRY,chilligrrl,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this on a whim on my parents 4K tv and left a huge puddle of drool on their lounge which didnot thrill them when they got home. I then drove into town to the only Korean BBQ Restaurant and pretty much ate out the whole shop. Don't watch this on 4K tv if you're hungry, it's dangerous and you'll be broke and explodingly full within 2 hours. You have been warned.",False

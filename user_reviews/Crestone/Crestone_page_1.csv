1,6,Worthy of at Least One Watch,hholifemoments,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerCrestone (2020) Documentary Review - Contains SpoilersA ragtag group of millennials run away from their families to the deserts of Colorado to grow weed and rap.They live off the land but also play with a VR Headset and survey the area for intruders using a drone.Drifting between the high of the heat, the land, the friendships and the bud, we see human behavior in its most explicit search for spirituality.As the ""Lord of the Flies""-type group of friends travel, they steal necessary supplies from homes abandoned due to the oncoming wildfire which gets the group moving.While trippy and possibly eccentric, it is a unique view on the plight of the millennial whose carnality yearns for substance and seeks it as a priest wafting incense through weed which opens a portal to the other side where god remains.Raises thoughtful points on the meaning of inspiration, purpose and the significance of society within and outside of the technological structure held together by systems innumerable.A fascinating sociological experiment whose ongoing search encapsulates the soul of modern day America: restless, confused, hungry, but searching for more.Exceptional cinematography both original and worthy of scrutiny.3/5.",True

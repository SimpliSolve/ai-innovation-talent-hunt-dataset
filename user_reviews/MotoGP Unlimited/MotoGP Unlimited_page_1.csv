1,8,It's a good watch,davidtaylor84,n/a,16/08/2025,"I seen the formula 1 drive to survive and thought a moto gp version would be great so was pretty excited when I seen the release date for this.That being said, it's a good watch, and I enjoyed it, but what is up with the dubbing? It's horrible, not even an option to turn it off and get subtitles instead, it kinda ruins the viewing for me. But if you're into moto gp I'd recommend it.",False
2,9,"Once the dubbing was fixed, wow",pfjhgzvkh,n/a,16/08/2025,Really enjoyed that season of Motogp unlimited! Once the dubbing was fixed in the US/UK it was honestly great. Truly enjoyed and was a great base to build the series on.,False
3,9,Great but missing some key players,fx_rousselot,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great show for MotoGP fans. Not sure if it's for those who are not, it may lack of drama building and character introductions.Also some key players did not had much air times, or even worse, were just not there (Zarco is the most obvious example, but. Naka, Brad etc...).I suspect the production focused on those who lived in Andora for practical reasons. Which would explain why they strangely focused on Rins for example.I learned and discovered a lot of interesting details and insights watching this. I hope we'll see more riders in the next season.",False
4,10,Great show,itospetro,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you like motorcycles it's 100% worth watching.Despite the negative commentaries about dibbling (that had nothing to do with the show), you can now change the language and subtitles and watch the original version. I recommend it.",False
5,10,"Dub problem is fixed, beautiful show.",sgtbilko80,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a superb look at one of the world's truly exciting sports and is highly recommended to anyone who loves MotoGP and to newcomers alike.Please ignore the dub related negative reviews, this show had a disastrous launch but those issues are fixed.Looking for a sport you can be passionate about? Here it is.",False
6,10,Great,borjav,n/a,16/08/2025,"I recommend changing the language in the settings and seeing it in the original version. In any case, it is appreciated that the dubbed version is included for those who may like it.",False
7,10,Great show,Crowbar100,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you into motorcycles or motorcycle racing, even as a casual fan then you will love this. Great footage and behind the scenes access. For me it better laid out than drive to survive, as
the episodes follows the season in chronological order rather than focus on a particular team in each episode.",False
8,7,Why the dubbing?!?,johnthemorrison,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love love love MotoGP and have been excited for this release for ages. Ever since ""Faster"" and ""Hitting the apex"" I've felt there needed to be an update for the best motor sport in my opinion. Especially since Formula One keeps getting shows made about it.This show had excellent coverage of the 21 season, and did a great job of following a wide spectrum of riders and teams. Definitely worth a watch even if you have only a passing interest in motorcycle racing.My only criticism is, why oh why did they decide to use corny dubbing for all of the non-English speaking contributors? Even the riders who do speak English such as Rossi were inexplicably dubbed over...",False
9,10,Beautiful Documentary,jamesmullen-01610,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a hardcore MotoGP fan who waited patiently since the first race of last year for this doc to be released I am not disappointed at all. The doc really gives you a insight into the personalities of the riders and had me warming to riders who I disliked in the past off of what I saw purely on race weekends with no context. Aside from that, some of the camera work is beautiful and it is such an easy documentary to watch - no big frills, no over the top drama, just totally feel good and has me hooked even more. The initial blip with the dubbing on release day was a disappointment but it doesn't take away from how good the show actually is in it's proper package!!",False
10,7,Why dub it?!,ttracey-27953,n/a,16/08/2025,The dubbing is terrible! Either have them all speak English or subtitle it. It's distracting and adds nothing. The all access is interesting but maybe a little too personal.,False
11,10,"Great production, wish we had this for the past years!",edoardoabate,n/a,16/08/2025,"Premise: I am a huge fan of the sport.That being said, the show does a great job in narrating the events of the 2021 championship from different perspectives, which you can only get if you are working in the paddock.It does a great job in highlighting the human side of the sport, the struggle of teams and riders, WITHOUT overly dramatizing the events, which is something that the F1 show tends to do. No scene is taken out of context to support the drama. I appreciate this a lot!I only wish we had gotten this kind of production in the previous years, but later is better than never!I recommend watching this, for sure. The only question mark I have is how much you can understand/appreciate being new to the sport, but I am not the right person to judge this.This is an awesome sport and this show/documentary simply does it justice! I hope there will be a follow up in 2022 and for the years to come.",False
12,6,Wtf is with the voice over?,mknauer51,n/a,16/08/2025,I wanna hear their actual voices...the dubbing is terrible...give me subtitles! .......................................150. Still too short? 152 153. Motorcycle motorcycle.,False
13,3,No dubbing issue but horrible production.,bergmanman-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Follow each season of MotoGP and was thrilled to see this series being produced. Only to be disappointed in extremely poor production and ""flow"" in the series.I don't follow Formula 1 but the Netflix series ""Drive to Survive"" really captures the excitement of the sport. The producers of Unlimited should take notes ok how it should be done.",False
14,10,Ignore the reviews about the dubbing,deanturner-33700,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an absolutely brilliant documentary. Yes they messed up the release with the dubbing issue, but that has now been fixed.As for the documentary itself, it's a brilliant watch, great insight to the world of motogp without the show creating false drama like a certain F1 show on Netflix.Worth watching even for people that haven't watched motogp before.",False
15,10,"Great series, no dodgy voice dubbing here!",martinraggett182-564-31246,n/a,16/08/2025,"I live in the UK, no voice overs here, just subtitles as normal which is great so it's got the real feal. Great behind the scenes stuff you never get to see, awesome! 10/10 from me and I've been a fan of bike racing since Barry and Kenny got me addicted to it, when I was 7!",False
16,10,Everything Drive to Survive Should Be,dhawkins-21928,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, they've removed the dubbingThe series is just fantastic. Really captures the characters of Moto GP, the highs and lows they go through, the injuries, the emotions, how vulnerable they can be, plus some mean racing!It is also in chronological order, which is a big complaint about DTS (back and forth).It's such a great docu-series for sports fans, not just motoGP fans.",False
17,10,Great Series which anybody can appreciate,rahulsuresh-18038,n/a,16/08/2025,"Once the dubbing issue has been resolved, this is one of the best sports series out there. This is what F1: Drive to Survive should have been. The soundtrack and camera works are really good too. This will get anybody to start watching MotoGp if they haven't already.",False
18,7,"A very good insight, but...",skinbobrabbit,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've owned bikes for 40 years. I love my bikes and all bike racing. The MotoGP era hasn't been my favourite class, although it's produced some fantastic racers, characters and successfully pushed motorcycling technology to some amazing levels that we occasionally get to share on the roads.This show gave an excellent insight into the MotoGP world. Rather than concentrating on the racing, it shows the background of the new blood and a couple of the older generation.The 2021 season saw the retirement of arguably the greatest Grand Prix rider the world has ever seen. Rossi made MotoGP his own. This series doesn't cover Rossi's career in huge detail, but in my opinion, covers his retirement excellently. It's not a show all about him but more about the upcoming stars of today, but salutes his farewell perfectly.The reason I've knocked a couple of points off my rating (nothing gets 10), is because there's one thing that really annoyed me for much of the series.Whoever decided that the UK version should be dubbed over with absolutely terrible, posh English accents needs sacking (I'm English btw).Some of the dubbed voices used for the show were diabolical.Why couldn't the producers at least find voice-over actors with the right accents?Rossi is Italian. Marquez, Spanish. Quatararo, French. To have Rossi dubbed with an accent like David Beckham just FAILED miserably.At some point a commentator was dubbed with voice that sounded like a football commentator from the 1940's. It almost forced me to turn it off.No motorcycle race commentator has EVER sounded like Terry Thomas as far as I remember.One thing to remember.TV will never, ever show the speed of how fast race bikes travel.If you want to see the truth in the flesh, then get yourself to a race.It doesn't have to be a MotoGP race or even a British championship race. Club races can provide some excellent entertainment but without the glamour. If you really, REALLY want to witness mind-blowing speed and ridiculous motorcycle skills, sell a kidney or 2 and get over to the Isle of Man for the TT or the Manx Grand Prix.You won't regret it and you'll have the best fun you can have with your clothes on.",True
19,10,Brilliant!,greggmitchell,n/a,16/08/2025,"Showed the raw emotion and a real insight to life within MotoGP. No fabricated drama to make the show 'better', exactly what this type of documentary should be.Unfortunate some of the negative ratings come from the subtitles/dubbing issue at the start. This show should only be watched in subtitles - the English dubbed version is horrendous.",False
20,7,Hopefully this is just the start...,willicatgirl,n/a,16/08/2025,"A good start to, what hopefully will be more, but it is flawed.Whereas Drive to Survive is accused of over dramatizing while lacking substance, Motogp Unlimited, with a wealth of natural drama & story, almost under-plays it somewhat. Storylines such as Vinales' departure from Yamaha, or Binder's crazy win in the wet are shown in a basic matter-of-fact way. My feeling is that the best motorsport documentary series probably lies somewhere between the two shows.Also with only 8 episodes several of the key players are missing from the storyline. Such as slightly eccentric rider Zarco who at one point was leading the championship, characters such as team boss Herve Poncharal or rookie Bastianini who scores 2 podiums (if they're filming the '22 season they must be desperately trying to find the footage of him from last year on the cutting room floor). Why not make the series 10 episodes & include more?Finally what is largely missing from both MU & DTS, but Mark Neale does very well in his Motogp films, is the fan angle. Shots of the campsites, the variety of fans, views of the races from among the crowd. Sure the early races were closed to fans due to Covid, but most of them were open. If you're going to try & attract more fans to watch the sport, you need to show them the full experience, the atmosphere, the camaraderie of being part of the spectacle.Hopefully with the 2nd season some of these issues can be addressed.",False
21,10,A Must Watch,noeldiaz-26850,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing inside look into the world of MotoGP. A motorcycle enthusiasts must watch as it shows us a behind the scenes look into what many of us would consider the dream career. I've watched the formula 1 documentary and I think this one is equally as good if not better, based on the risks these guys take. Will definitely watch the entire season again, really hope they continue it every year as MotoGP keeps growing in size and popularity.",False
22,6,A good show ruined,djdmuscle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Possibly the most amateurish dubbing since since the porn industry stopped bothering. Who on earth thought this was a good idea? A potentially fascinating show ruined. Only the seriously diehard motorcycle racing fans will sit through this, which is surely not the aim of this presumably costly investment? Much of the translation doesn't even make sense. A rider exclaiming that he can't ""bend the bike""... Could that be ""get the bike to change direction? "".",False
23,5,Not worth to watch it,sgtGiggsy,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you didn't like MotoGP before, this series most certainly won't be the reason to start watching it. And that pretty much sums up the biggest problem with it. Drive to Survive makes you want to watch Formula-1 even if you've never been a fan, while MotoGP Unlimited makes you bored even if you're a long time fan of the championship.I don't know what others see in it. It doesn't capture the highs and the lows, it's melancolic from the begining till the end. It shows very little of the fun parts, the challenges, the rivalries... Throughout all the episodes you feel like you watch a drama about dying people, everyone is so serious and straight faced all the time. I could barely finish it, it's so boring. And it doesn't even give you some insight about the championship at all. If you are a fan, you already knew pretty much everything it shows.And the sad part is, MotoGP has so much more show factor than F1. The riders much less bound by their contract, they have much less filter on their mouth, there are very few boring guys in the series, yet MotoGP Unlimited shows almost nothing about it.If you want a genuinely good, insightful and entertaining MotoGP series, watch Tales of Valentino. MUCH better and captures the essence of MotoGP and riders' mentality much more.",False
24,10,Essential viewing,gringoes,n/a,16/08/2025,Whether you're a motogp fan or only have a passing interest this is a fantastic series serving as both a season review whilst also taking you into the riders lives that up to now has been very much behind the curtain for the majority of us.,False
25,10,Great watch,nithinmgowda,n/a,16/08/2025,"No unnecessary drama or rivalry created like the F1 DTS, they have done a great job to capture moments like they are without adding any extra drama to it. It's nice to see riders off racetrack.",False

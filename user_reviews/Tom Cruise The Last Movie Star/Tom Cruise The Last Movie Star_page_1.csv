1,5,"Excellent work ethic, dedication, and hard work = Tom",Ameliex,n/a,16/08/2025,"Regardless of what we all think about Tom, we can't deny the fact that he has done many amazing movies. The movies that he has done have been extraordinary.This documentary was nice to see. But it didn't really tell me anything new, that I already didn't know about Tom.I'm a huge fan of his work, and I think I have seen 99% of his movies.All these people in this documentary saying how amazing Tom is, and how incredible his work is, is what we all think. Nothing new here.The man is 61 years old and still going strong. Still making these insane/intense movies with tons of energy. The energy that some folks younger than him don't even have.He has such dedication to his craft that it's insane. He is such a perfectionist and that perfectionist makes him create these incredible movies. We see the details in his movies, made in the most perfect way.The work ethic, dedication, and hard work he puts into his movies are incredible.But 100% he isn't the last movie star though, he is ONE OF the last ones.Anyhow this documentary wasn't really WOW or it didn't really show us anything new. But it was nice seeing though. Nice seeing a history of his work. But no one can deny though that his work has been incredible. He has an impressive resume for sure!When the time comes, when Tom Cruise no longer does these Mission Impossible movies, it will be a sad sad sad day. The same way when Daniel Craig stopped making those James Bond movies.Should you see this documentary? If you are bored and have nothing else to do, sure.",False
2,6,VIEWS ON FILM review of Tom Cruise: The Last Movie Star,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler2023's Tom Cruise: The Last Movie Star is not so much a documentary as it is an A&E Biography special sort of lapsing into syndication. I mean I'm not saying that's a bad thing but why announce it as an actual release when it could easily qualify as boob tube filler via 6 PM on a Tuesday.With ""The Last Movie Star"", you have a timeline of Cruise's permanence of a career, the highs and the mid-lows all sort of pasted together and on the fly. I mean why is he so able to easily play Ethan Hunt over the span of nearly thirty years? And why would he fire his manager who just happens to be his own sister by blood? And uh, what's up with his fascination with Scientology and his yearn to plunge into the almighty meltdown (Oprah's couch ring a bell?)?Yeah Tommy boy is a pretty interesting guy, and Tom Cruise: The Last Movie Star is pretty juicy stuff. The production values, well they ain't much and the propped up interviews, well they're from people I've never heard of (except for critic Richard Roeper, but no captions regardless). The particulars regarding Cruise's metier journey however, are raw and honest. And the archives of him in Top Gun, Days of Thunder, and/or Risky Business mode, are evocative and longing for the past of glorious 80s/90s pop cinema.Tom Cruise: The Last Movie Star, well it puts ""the cruiser"" in equal parts negative and positive lighting. And while we see him show up periodically in the flick, he's mysteriously not there in probing to defend himself via his own delineation. Oh well. At 75 breezy minutes, ""The Last Movie Star"" is worth at least one watch if you're a Cruise fanboy or someone who didn't know every tidbit about his meteoric rise in the meaty cesspool of ""Hollyweird"". Operatic ""star"".",True
3,2,Cheap rip off that isnt worthy of being called a documentary at all.,imseeg,n/a,16/08/2025,"NOT authorized by Tom Cruise himself. Mind you, this is simply a cheap rip off with a few old scenes of movies and LOTS of complete UNKNOWN NOBODIES talking about Tom Cruise his carreer AS IF these clowns would know anything we couldnt google on the internet.Another example of smart marketting, because unfortunately a small percentage of fans MIGHT think that this is actually worth paying for. BEWARE: this is utter rubbish.Better watch any other Tom Cruise movie or simply google for any interview with Tom Cruise himself it will be more rewarding and interesting than watching this dribble called a ""documentary"".",False
4,n/a,"Profile of Tom Cruise's career, interesting even for those who are not fans.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tom Cruise himself does not participate directly, this uses clips from most of his movies, essentially in chronological order, to illustrate the points being made here. It also includes many clips of Cruise in such situations as publicity appearances or behind the scenes during movie-making. Looking at the entire list of his movies since 1981, I realize I have watched almost all of them.To me the title poses a question, not an answer, ""Is Cruise the last movie star?"" It is strongly suggested that he might be if you consider his career arc over 40+ years and that even in his late 50s and early 60s is still making action movies and doing his own stunts. And his blockbusters seem to be making more and more money than ever.It touches on his involvement with Scientology, but only briefly and to point out that his avoiding discussion of it is probably better for his career.I watched this at home, streaming on Prime. For me, a movie fan in general, I found it totally interesting and worthwhile viewing. Regardless of what one thinks of Cruise as a person, he is probably the hardest worker in the business and his movies are the better for it.",False
5,9,ill bet my...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLife, that tom cruise lingers in the oblivious shadows of the production crew line, because this is more than just a regular presentation of the last socalled moviestar, its really the most supreme way to sell ones products, even for the old punchliners of the past, cause new generations needs to get fused in a miracolus ways these day, squemish as they are with all and everything bundled in the one and the only gadget they know how to use, the smartphone!!!This is a brilliant showdown how to advertize the brand called tom cruise, bless him for what he has done and say a grace to protect him in forthcoming projects, cause daredevils only have just one life too, a fact the young noodles have completely forgotten after having gamed away half their lives ,viewing energybars and lives in the bank, in a dark corner of a home where they live safe and sound.Tom cruise has always been one of my favourites, next to the jolly good fellow called tom hanks, also one of the last moviestars. So take this documentary for what it is, a great commercial. A recommend anyway ,from the grumpy old man.",True

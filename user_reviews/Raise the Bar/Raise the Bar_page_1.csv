1,10,Spectacular.,ada_qgalskap,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is probably the best documentary I have watched in a long while.These badass young girls building character and learning to take their place and stand up for themselves blew me away.A perfect scenery of how cruel in-equality is and it shows once again how long the road still is in order to create opportunities and space for the next gen of young girls who dream big.Please, watch this and you will be left with so many emotions at the same time. Inspiration, anger and disappointment of seeing that we still find ourselves in the years of 1920's. Thank you girls. And thank you Brynjar.You are the biggest badasses I have seen.",False

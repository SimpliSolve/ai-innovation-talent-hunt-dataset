1,5,"It is what it is, lol",earl004,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well I guess since KUWTK has come to an end I need a new reality show to watch when I'm bored, this will be it! Give it a chance it's cute, but the darker skin grandchild....everything she says sounds scripted so that gets annoying. But it's alright I enjoyed it.",False
2,6,The only reality show I watch,barrypatrice,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Terry Bradshaw. I always have. To see him with his family in his home it's great. They say it's scripted is it really? I mean at the drive through when Erin said ""I love you"" to the guy I laughed just as hard as they did! I don t think that was scripted!I love their banter and sense of humor. Terry's love for his family shines through every episode!",False
3,8,An enjoyable show,mkoplitz,n/a,16/08/2025,"We watch this show, and enjoy it. Terry's granddaughter Zurie cracks me up!! I'm sure as others have said that some, most or all of her lines may be written for her. But she's still funny. We take it for what it is, a fun show. I think movie and TV critics (and a kit of people who write reviews) get too serious sometimes. I just want to be entertained and this show is entertaining. A lot of other people complain how about how much time the 'girls' spend at Terry's house. It's not like it would take days and days of time to get the spots they show. A lot of times it is when the girls do come over, it's not like they live there. And there have been times when one of the girls or a son-in-law isn't there due to work or some other circumstance. Plus during the football season Terry has to be flying to LA for shows on Sun and Thu so he's at least away those days. So maybe they get together on the weekends? I know my step son and his family come over to our house almost every Sunday to have dinner together. I'd say take it for what it is and enjoy it!",False
4,1,Doesnt deserve even a 1 star,heliparts,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerAnother stupid boring reality show on people trying to make money out of viewers. Dont waste your time on these types of shows people. Otherwise you are just as bad as them,True
5,8,We don't watch much reality TV,pvanrhee,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not a big football fan. Know Terry Bradshaw from the show with Henry Winkler and George Foreman. He was wacky in that, so when this came out we took a chance. His daughters are good looking, as is his wife. They do some fun stuff. Bradshaw and his grand daughter interacting make the show. She's funny and pranks him. If all reality TV is like this, we should watch more.",False
6,1,Scripted and not really funny,Xavier_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every 10star review is from account from one review, being 2 months old. But I watched anyway as I generally like Terry on his Fox football show. I couldn't make it through one episode. Nothing is real, 30yo married kids hanging out at his massive horse ranch and doing nothing. Some kid has all of his line written for him and it's annoying as all hell.Perhaps this is a show to increase the value of his ranch as it's well known he's trying to sell it.",False
7,10,Terry Bradshaw cracks me up!,kurxdoc,n/a,16/08/2025,Gotta say I wasn't sure about this show but I love it! Terry cracks me up and I love that the whole family is on the show. I dearly hope they make another season and I hope to eat at Noah's restaurant some day.,False
8,1,Scripted and staged,teebear817,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a lifetime Pittsburgh resident. I was a young teenager when Terry Bradshaw was winning the Super Bowls, so he's a Pittsburgh icon and I love him and I still have affection for him, so it pains me to write a negative review about his show because of the memory of what he did for our city, bringing us four Super Bowls. Just because you like someone doesn't mean you should be dishonest. This show is pretty awful. We all know Terry; he's loud and obnoxious and funny and likeable but a little bit of that goes a long way. The interactions with the young girl as someone else said sounds so fake and scripted. She says things that are way above her age range, which tells me they're writing those funny lines for her. The scenes seem typically staged... they have to to make things interesting. So you know the writer is writing a lot of this show. it's pretty much fake, I mean, how many 32 year old ""kids"" hang around your dad's house all the time? Especially when they're married. Most shows like this have the same tired formula. Fake dramatic situations and storylines...a preposterous amount of laughing. No family laughs this much. Bradshaw supplies the humor. I do not care for Bradshaw's wife.. something about her turns me off, I just don't care for her. They dont seem right together. I could be wrong but I don't think this will last long. Oh and Terry..... For your own health...lose 50 pounds.",False
9,10,The White Othello,williamdavidwaller,n/a,16/08/2025,"This Shakespearean novella matriculates like Fermat's Last Theorem... congruent, resolved yet illucid and manically vibrant as the former footballer screams, ""I still matter!"" He looks up at the ""light"" from the bottom of the well not realizing he was in the light all along doomed to the tragedy of facing public acceptance which is just another Sisyphus cliché. Tragedy Rating: 10 / All Else Rating; 0",False
10,1,The Bradshaw Bunch,sacbd,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really like Terry Bradshaw. I watch him every Sunday on Fox pre game show. However, I think Terry should stick with being a sports announcer and the rest of his family should go back to what they were doing before taping this show. I find nothing interesting or entertaining about this show. I have watched on several occasions and half way thru the show, I'm checking my tv listings to see what else is on. IMO this show is not of high rate material and has no business being aired because, obviously, reality tv is not this family's forte.",False
11,10,Funny!!,sharonsexton-02547,n/a,16/08/2025,Love this show! It's a breath of fresh air for today's reality shows!,False
12,1,Repulsive and staged,sillydogsforever,n/a,16/08/2025,"What father is upset because his 30 year old daughter hasn't told her Dad she got breast implants? This is either a storyline idea that is outrageous or he's far too interested in his grown daughter's bodies. Some things you don't have to tell your Dad. They have no privacy from this large giggling idiot. He's way over animated to be believable. What grown children hang around their fathers house like this? Sorry, this show needs to go. He's barely watchable and he's downright obnoxious.",False
13,n/a,My message is for reviewer mllewis,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"You have your information wrong. When you said ""doesn't show her relationship with her mother Erin"" Erin is NOT Zuris mother. LACEY is Zuris mother. Lacey is Terry's stepdaughter and Laceys daughter is Zuri. Erin just gave birth at the end of last year (December 2021) to a girl which is her first born.",False
14,10,Family fun,lambgary444,n/a,16/08/2025,Honestly this is the first time i have watched a new show especially a reality show where i have no complaints. The family is great and friendly the daughters are all beautiful i admit i think Erin is the prettiest and funniest. Yes i know she is married and i am old enough to be her dad it's not meant in any dirty way. In my day it was okay to say a young woman was beautiful and funny and her husband is a lucky man. That is not mean or sexist if that offends anyone i apologize that's another thing i like about this show they are not P/C nuts. Terries grandson looks just like him his grand daughter is adorable and you can see the love between them. All of them are great people and so fun to watch and the women do not feel the need to show their T/A to prove they are beautiful women. They are beautiful they care more about showing their personalities and who they are as people and i love it. I feel sad when beautiful young women think they need to show us their uh hum goodies to let us know they are grown women ! Trust me we know and there is nothing wrong with being beautiful and sweet and thought of the nice girl. Look at some of Americas biggest stars that have been called Americas sweetheart Sandra Bulluck. Meg Ryan etc.. the whole world love them because they did not feel the need to show you their goodies and every guy wanted to marry them. Terry is one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play the game he is also my favorite announcer and i a Patriots fan. That is what makes Terry such a great entertainer people who love other teams still love Terry because he is a great entertainer sure but its his personality that makes him great. I find it impossible to not like him i would go so far is to say if someone did not like Terry i would be nervous about them ! Enjoy this show because it about a loving family and is a family friendly show that also slips in their love of god it may not be around to long. I hope it is but it seems the crazy shows last long and he nice family shows are not around anymore so please tune in and show not just America but the world we here in America still love families that love each other and god that is not a bad thing at least to me. Trolls save it i will not reply to any of you.,False
15,3,Get rid of the kid...,mdebotton,n/a,16/08/2025,"On ep 4 and while it mostly seems fake and scripted I'm going to give it a chance. But I do mute it every time the granddaughter has a scene. Everything that comes out of her mouth is scripted which might be fine if she were a good actress. But she's not. So I say if you want the show to succeed, or at least have a chance, start by getting rid of the kid.",False
16,9,Feel good show with lots of laughs,ashley_katrina,n/a,16/08/2025,Terry and his family are hilarious! I watched this show on a whim and love it.,False
17,1,Save Us Jebus,Hitting841,n/a,16/08/2025,Accidentally watched this because I thought it was an old episode of the Brady Bunch coming on. It was not and I was very disappointed.Why? Just why? Who asked for this? I'm guessing a few idiots becausr it's back for a s2.,False
18,9,Very funny,texas_robin82,n/a,16/08/2025,It's a funny look into the life of terry and his family. I enjoy it immensely. Him and his granddaughter together have me laughing constantly. Especially when the pranks start.,False
19,2,Just Curious.,mllewis-18595,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched 2 recorded episodes with finger on the >> button. Not much different from other rudderless so-called ""reality"" shows.For some reason there isn't much bio on the Granddaughter, or her relationship with her mother Erin. Many seem to find her to be cute, and entertaining...scripted, or not.The 2nd such show(Chrisley Knows Best) that doesn't provide much bio about the grandchild of color in the family dynamic.",False
20,10,Refreshing,steph-388,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love this show - it makes me want to be a part of that family! I love how open and honest Terry is with his daughters - plus they all have a lot of personality. It's nice to see a cool, funny family like the Bradshaws versus a family that's always immersed in self-imposed drama for ratings. It's honest and I love it.",False
21,2,Huge Terry Bradshaw fan BUT....,rickbell19,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show has so much potential but it completely misses the mark.Unfunny, annoying grandkids & repetitive. But then again, NONE of the family reality
shows are good.Terry is just collecting a big paycheck.",False
22,10,Love Terry Bradshaw,Rebornsugar,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a huge fan of Terry Bradshaw. He's hilarious. Knows how to have fun. Love watching Terry and his family. Entertaining show. His granddaughter is too funny, and so smart.",False

24,9,Love this Guy!,cwberner,n/a,16/08/2025,"What joy watching this show! Laughed and cried! This show made my day! I can't wait to see more! Thank you all! Terry Bradshaw, a natural!! Maybe a limitless less cursing from the beautiful daughter! Once again, love this show, and was so needed after such a long miserable epidemic!",False
25,1,Not impressed!,vernam-68893,n/a,16/08/2025,"Grandchild seems very disrespectful. Comments and actions very inappropriate. Rachel makes series all about her, very fake person, always ready for the camera... very materialistic.",False

1,8,Salsa!,imdbfan-5762231476,n/a,16/08/2025,"Caught 'La Salsa Vive' at SXSW, knowing absolutely nothing about salsa music beforehand, and walked out energized and fascinated. The film bounces between the gritty streets of 1970s New York and Cali, Colombia today, seamlessly connecting the dots of how a genre survived and thrived across generations and continents. The archival footage felt raw and nostalgic, and the stories told by legends like Rubén Blades made me realize how music can truly change lives. By the end, I wasn't just entertained-I was emotionally invested, rooting for the artists, the dancers, and a culture I had barely known existed. Even if you're not into salsa or music documentaries, this film hits notes of passion, resilience, and pure joy that anyone can appreciate. It's an unexpected highlight of SXSW, for sure.",False

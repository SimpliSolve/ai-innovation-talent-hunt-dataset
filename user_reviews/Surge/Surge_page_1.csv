3,1,Watch Breathlessly as White Women Endlessly Congratulate Themselves for Resisting...Themselves,pootboy-882-636843,n/a,15/08/2025,"White women, handily the largest voting block and ultimate decider of all US elections, casually co-opt black power first to glorify their stunning and brave resistance of the candidate they overwhelmingly voted for.",False
4,7,Enjoyable and inspiring documentary,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Surge"" (2020 release; 90 min.) is a documentary about the surge of women running for office following the shocking election of Trump in the 2016 elections. As the movie opens, we watch footage of the Women's March in January, 2017, a day after Trump is sworn in, in one of the largest marches ever in history. We then go to ""March 2017"", as we are introduced to three Democratic women who are first time candidates for the US House of Representatives, all running against incumbent male Republicans: Jana Sanchez (in suburban Dallas), Lauren Underwood (in suburban Chicago), and Liz Watson (in Bloomington, IN). All three literally start from scratch, with no money and no name recognition. At this point we are 10 min. into the film.Couple of comments: this documentary is a labor of love from co-directors and producers Hannah Rosenzweig and Wendy Sachs. They spend 20 months on the road with these three candidates, and condense it into an hour and a half for our viewing pleasure. I admit I have never heard of any of these three candidates before seeing this film, and of course one of the things that make this enjoyable to watch is to see how it all would turn out (I predicted the correct outcome for two of the three candidates--no worries, I will not spoil). But besides enjoyable, this documentary is equally inspiring, and not just for women (to take solace that they can do this), but equally for men like myself who are tired of the current political landscape where Dear Leader in the White House sets the despicable tone for everyone else and furthermore is interested in only one thing: me! me! ME! Meanwhile ""Surge"" is not a 10/10 movie (like some many here rate it), nor is it a 1/10 movie (do you want to guess who rated this 1/10?), but somewhere in between. I rate it a solid 7/10.""Surge"" premiered in September on Showtime and is now available on SHO On Demand (where I caught it recently) and other streaming services. If you are interested in the role of women in politics, or are simply wanting to be inspired by what these three candidates take on, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False

6,7,Inspiring and educational,liezlvr-09058,n/a,15/08/2025,I was rooting for the 3 candidates throughout and was totally engaged. Great storytelling and inspiring - I will rewatch with my 11-year old daughter!,False
7,10,"AWESOME, AWESOME.",bmdjwqzx,n/a,15/08/2025,"Women are powerful and this documentary shows how hard candidates, volunteers, and staffers worked to get women to Congress in 2018. As a staffer in 2018, it made me tired reliving that moment. Ha! A lot of people don't know what goes into political campaigns, and this documentary covered three campaigns beautifully.",False
8,10,Solid,rashad-62674,n/a,15/08/2025,Be sure to give it a try for yourself! You will enjoy the movie. I am impressed with the way in which they were able to tie everything together to ensure that the viewer has an understanding of the journey of these 3 aspiring congress people. Please go into this film with an open mind and you will decide from there whether or not it's a worthy film. But I have to say that I did enjoy it and I have recommended it to my friends.,False

10,10,Exactly what we need right now,gburud,n/a,15/08/2025,Every campaign has a story of trials and tribulations. I loved the stories of these three strong women who ran fearless campaigns.,False
11,10,INSPIRING AND EMPOWERING,njd-43580,n/a,15/08/2025,"To answer the question posed, ""Is this a moment or a movement?"" one need only look at the results of the 2018 mid-terms. Democratic women won seats at state and national levels unseen before. THIS IS DEFINITELY A MOVEMENT and we are not slowing down! The face of politics is changing, in large part because of the determination of women like those featured in Surge. In the words of the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, ""Women belong in all places where decisions are being made.""Bravo! to the producers and all the crew involved in the making of this documentary. Excellent work! Expect the surge to continue, America. We will be heard.",False
12,10,Surge - best documentary!,szvvbinehw,n/a,15/08/2025,Surge tells the story of the surge in women running for Congress in 2018 by following three women who did so. There are many powerful moments where it actually brought tears to my eyes because it was so moving. This documentary reveals that this surge was more than a moment in history. It was and still is a movement! I highly recommend Surge!,False
13,10,"Timely, Inspiring and Motivating Documentary",paul-publications,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Is it a movement or just a moment?"" The filmmakers let you decide, and the book is still open on that question. Here's hoping that this tale of the 2018 congressional elections sparks more women to run for office. Congress has long been the bastion of old white men beholden to special interests. (Hey, I'm an old white man, and boy, do we need some new blood!) The subtext of the docu is this: Our country needs young, smart, strong, energetic women running for office...and winning. White women. Brown women. Black women. Then, it will be a movement and a much needed one. Thanks to the producers for bringing to life this inspiring and motivating documentary!",False

21,10,Great movie highlighting involvement,reneehelfenstein,n/a,15/08/2025,"Surge is a fabulous film that outlines why we all need to be engaged. Our voice matters. We need to stand behind the people we believe in -women in particular. In the wake of RBGs death, this movie has had a greater impact on me. If you want to make a difference, get involved, ask questions and engage with your local candidates. This is a great documentary sharing the story of 3 communities coming together to support their candidate and make a difference in everyone's future.",False

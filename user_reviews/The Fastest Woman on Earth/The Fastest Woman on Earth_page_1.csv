1,8,Female Evel Knievel,markaperez,n/a,16/08/2025,Nothing spectacular about this documentary. Made just like any other but it does add more to just being someone that was on Myth Busters for a short time. Which is how I knew her. I think the interviews were well done and the land speed footage was great. Thought the part about her wanting/needing/willing to start a family or whatever they were trying to say was a bit over the top. The part of Kitty O'neil was great and needs to be told on its own. The ending is what really makes this. We all know how it ends but I would say how they portrayed it but I was surprised how they did it when other documentaries might not have done it that way. So maybe this documentary was not like any other.,False
2,7,Having the courage to do amazing things,RedKidBytes,n/a,16/08/2025,"The life of Jessi Combs is on display in this documentary. She races repurposed cars that are converted fighter jets to attain the fastest speed on land. The idea of a jet propulsion-powered vehicle on wheels that could move up to the speeds of 500-700 mph is so crazy that only a handful of people have the money, fearlessness, and fortitude to do it. And there has been one female within the last few decades ever to try to break the record.Nonetheless, this documentary is more than just the superb shots from the driver's side making you feel like you are in the driver's seat. Jessi's story is truly inspiring for all women. Her strength comes from her belief in God, the creator of all things, and facing the difficulties with patience and passion for truly loving and believing in her purpose. That is changing the world forever for the better.Her strong conviction about how she saw women as men's equal is quite evident in her statement. As she sat on top of her big boy motorcycle, she said ""this bike does not know or care if I am a woman or a man. It responds to me in the same way it responds to a male. So if a male can do it so could I"".",False
3,8,The Fastest Woman on Earth - AND her Team,thejdrage,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having been a woman in a man's world a thousand years ago (aviation), I know that I couldn't have gone far without the men who surrounded me and taught me so very well, and kept my aircraft in tip top shape (I flew aerobatics).What Jessi Combs did was amazing - and so was the team that supported and respected and loved her. BTW - she earned all of it - and they knew it.This documentary was a tribute to people who are extraordinary and want to find a way to go faster (and higher) and help one another - at all costs. For Jessi, it was the cost of family. My flight instructor admonished me to ""Stay with your own kind"". He was right. I wish I could have told that to Jessi.The addition of Kitty O'Neil's achievements - and life - was a bonus and the fact that Jessi looked up to her was a lesson for all of us.The way this documentary was presented (inside the ""car"") was edgy - and let us hear and feel exactly what was happening - taking us to the edge. Taking us over the line to the record breaking speeds.Thank you, Jessi Combs AND Thank You to her wonderful Team. We lost you far too soon.",False
4,10,Heartbreaking,dcarroll74,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was wary coming into this documentary, purely on it's length. Sometimes long documentaries need padding out, to justify it's existances. In this case, it wasn't so, I was engrossed from start to finish.I only ""knew"" Jessi from Overhauling, me being Irish, living in Irish land. Yet, there was something infectious about her demeanor, which probably gave her the job in the first place.Learnng about Kitty O'Neill was an eye opener, this documenatry kicks male drivers in the balls, and rightly so.She probbly wasn't aware of an IRISH female driver, Rosemary Smith, who kicked ass in the 70's and 80's, winning many championships.And just to confirm she couln't drive, she drove a Renault F1 car as a guest of Renault, about 3 years ago, at the age of 80; when Richard Hammond of Top Gear fame, couldn't drive an F1 car beyond 100 metres.Look it up, we Irish love our women drivers.",False
5,10,So good!!!,jonastevens,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerSuch a fantastic story. I loved this documentary. Very well shot and so sad what happened to her though. Had me in tears at the end. She was taken way too soon. Her story could inspire so many people though to follow their passions. Live life to the fullest!! Bless this woman and her family.This was so worth watching. HBO has a track record of making great documentaries and they just keep churning them out.Please rate this high even if you didn't like it because Jessi's story deserves to be seen and heard.This is television at its finest. Thank you HBO for putting this out there for everyone to see.,True
6,10,An honest tribute to a true pioneer.,hhzqnff,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPassionate and moving. This is an inspiring tribute to an exceptional individual with so much passion, skill and drive. An exceptional person with sincere drive and passion. Her love and determination always shined through. This is a well executed tribute to a person that could do anything they set their mind and heart to.I remember bonding with my father over cars, that was his passion. He watched all the shows, virtually everyday. It became a way for us to connect, to be close. I remember first learning about Jessi Combs, watching episodes of Overhaulin' with my dad. I always could see how special of a person she was. This documentary pay great tribute to that person and that unstoppable force she was.",True
7,10,"Emotional, inciteful, exhilarating.",maidwell-45616,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm in the rare position to review this documentary blind. I went in spoiler free as I don't keep up with current events or watch much mainstream TV. Jessi Combs was unknown to me before watching. I was interested in it as I once kept up with land speed record attempts and have seen the two Thrust cars at the Coventry Motor Museum in the UK.If you also want to be spoiler free stop reading and watch it now, I highly recommend it.Getting to know Jessi in the nearly two hour run time was exhilarating and inspiring, she had a wild spirit and was brave enough to do what she loved. She was also self aware, knowing that following those dreams meant other parts of her life were suffering and this is explored too.I'm sure not many people will be in my position but seeing her final run for the new record and not knowing the outcome ahead of time was shocking but very respectfully portrayed. It's a huge shame that someone so talented and young lost her life in that way but she achieved what she set out to do, that's something we all aspire for.I could've done without the religious aspects but other than that I was thoroughly engrossed for the whole run time.",True
8,8,A complicated hero,avdmer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is a snapshot of Jessi's life. What makes me want to show this film to my daughter is Jessi's determination to be the best. Not the fastest woman, she was just trying to be the fastest person on earth.Juxtaposed with that was her reality of being a women and the need to have a family.Jessi was, as many of our heros, and also her own hero, a complicated personality. Trying to fit a personal life into her professional life was clearly a difficult challenge. The documentary includes a mini-documentary inside about one of Jessi's heros and how her professional and personal life fell apart. Jessi's public bubbling personality is shown but balanced with the focus she could muster under difficult and dangerous conditions, and her vulnerable moments, such as touching the car while praying.Before I saw this film, I was in some way hoping that Jessi's last run's would not be shown from in-car footage, but ultimately the footage was handled with care and respect, and I am glad they included it in such a manner.I don't know if I saw something I wanted to see, but it was as if the last couple of runs, her frown was deeper and she was more serious about the goal.The reality is that everyone, no matter their gender or skill level, struggles with these personal battles, but that these struggles do not need to stop us from reaching our goals.",True
9,10,As someone who was completely unfamiliar with Jessi's story...,APurchasedSpiritLedSurvivor,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirstly, this documentary was impeccably crafted, with solid footage that built up to a profoundly tragic conclusion. I was completely unaware of Jessi Combs' fate until the shocking end of the film. Witnessing her brave attempt to break the world record at over 500mph was both awe-inspiring and heart-wrenching. When tragedy struck and Jessi lost control of the malfunctioning car, crashing into the brush with a sickening thud, it was a moment that will stay with me forever. While Jessi's pursuit of the world record was a testament to her courage, her untimely death underscores the sobering reality that some risks are simply too great. Reflecting on this documentary, it serves as a powerful reminder to young thrill-seekers that while triumph is exhilarating, pushing oneself to the absolute limit, even in the pursuit of greatness, can come at an unimaginable cost. Life is precious above all else.",True

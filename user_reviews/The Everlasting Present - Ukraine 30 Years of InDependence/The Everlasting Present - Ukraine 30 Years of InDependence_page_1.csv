1,9,"Excellent, well balanced perspective",Seanwasright,n/a,15/08/2025,"""My side is perfect and pure and your side is evil"". That's about as much nuance as most people seem to have time for these days. There's a need to have the world be black and white so the virtue signalers can preach to everyone else from their ""moral high ground"". But only the naive see the world so clearly defined, reality is actually gray.This film does an outstanding job of detailing much of the recent events that have made Ukraine such a complicated place for the last ~30 years. It has many interviews with the prominent people involved and is an excellent continuation of the films Oliver Stone has done on Ukraine previously.",False

1,10,One of the best documentaries of its kind...,spmjm,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'll make this quick, because I rarely write reviews, but TSI warrants major praise.So much commentary on so many different issues presented... But it's not just the way the film is constructed (which is marvelous), but the fact Kicklighter doesn't try to overemphasize some social justice message, or an opinion on the arts, or opera, or trans rights. It simply--for the most part (there were 5 seconds where it does not do that at all, and it's sort of awkwardly funny)--observes. Which I know firsthand is such a difficult tone to strike in this type of documentary, to put a more or less objective spotlight on a subject and the subject matter they bring to the forefront. Never a dull moment either in a story that, on paper, you would never expect to be this intensely riveting.Anyway. Absolute must-see. And if it's not shortlisted for an Oscar, something's amiss.",False
2,10,A beautiful film about perseverance and passion,tarynlahey-13268,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lucia is an inspiring person, and while being transgender is very much a part of her Identity, and perhaps why she may be the most perfectly cast ""Don Giovanni"" in recent history, her trans-ness is not at the forefront of this story, at least it wasn't my main take away. It brings us into the world of modern Opera, an artform that has been waning in popularity for decades but for those who love it, their dedication is clear. It takes us behind the scenes with some amazing artists, showing us the long hours, technological frustrations, time away from loved ones and other hard sacrifices that it takes to be a successful and stay relevant, especially in the world of live productions. It shows the importance of adapting and changing with the times while staying true to your passions and understanding your own history. The relationships between the characters is heartfelt, and the story arc is incredibly engaging. I can't wait to see what Kicklighter makes next.",False
3,10,"Moving, Inspiring & Unforgettable!",marykaymentzer,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Sound of Identity is an award-worthy documentary which serves as a crystalline reminder that although a performer is influenced by their past and present identities and experiences; the portrayal of a role is not constrained by these. Director, James Kicklighter, not only succeeds but is also victorious in capturing Lucia Lucas' portrayal of Don Giovanni at the Tulsa Opera. The storytelling successfully navigates that Ms. Lucas is a transgender woman without eclipsing that she is also a baritone who wields a gravity capable of drawing her audience to the very epicenter of emotion. In fact, it is more to the point to say Ms. Lucas is a world class operatic baritone who also happens to be a transgender woman. Given her performance, I am convinced Ms. Lucas could portray absolutely any role within her vocal range. Throughout the film, she is alternately powerful and genuinely vulnerable as she prepares for and promotes the production of Don Giovanni. She brings a refreshing perspective to the role of a quintessential rake and womanizer as he rushes headlong toward his own destruction. Particularly endearing in this film are the interactions between Ms. Lucas and Tulsa's Artistic Director, Tobias Picker. Their conversations show a tender and growing friendship in their work together to make history as the Tulsa Opera prepares for Ms. Lucas' American operatic debut as a transgender woman. Mr. Kicklighter is triumphant in depicting the journey without objectifying. I highly recommend and, if I could, would give far more than 10-stars!",False
4,10,"A Moving, Must-See!",wendyljones-music,n/a,15/08/2025,"The film offers an intimate and genuine glimpse into the artist's life, exploring the challenges of achieving work-life balance and making sacrifices for one's art. These themes should resonate deeply with artists and those who share their lives with them. However, the film's scope extends beyond this. It also tells the groundbreaking story of Lucia Lucas, the first transgender woman to perform as Don Giovanni with the Tulsa Opera.The direction avoids sensationalism, focusing instead on the authentic human experience. While it highlights Lucia's struggles, the film doesn't rely on gimmicks. Instead, it emphasizes the universal desire to live authentically and with love.Director James Kicklighter is to be commended for his ability to create a documentary that doesn't feel preachy, judgmental, or political in any way. He skillfully delivers Lucia's story and allows each audience member to form their own opinions and feelings.I was thoroughly captivated by the film. It made me laugh and cry, leaving me so profoundly moved by the end that I was rendered speechless. I will be watching this again and recommending it to all of my friends.",False

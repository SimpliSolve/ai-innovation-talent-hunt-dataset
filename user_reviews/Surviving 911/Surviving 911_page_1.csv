1,8,Tragedy & Triumph Through A Personal Lens,AudioFileZ,n/a,16/08/2025,"Imagining, like me, you've seen much 9-11 programing you might be thinking I've seen enough, especially in this the twentieth anniversary. All I can say is I found Surviving 9/11 compelling and hardly redundant. These previously unknown personal narratives are often as remarkable as they're heartbreaking. I can not remember most of these stories therefore this is a recommended view. There's some clarity as to the horror that is gritty and this should be kept in mind. I think the video fearlessly honors the deceased, the survivors, and the commonality of human bravery and resilience.",False
2,5,Odd,jamespetenbrink,n/a,16/08/2025,I have watched everything possible on 9/11 and lived through it like so many of us so it is emotional to watch this. This is so good in many ways but weird in so many others. You can tell it was done after 2020 because instead of talking about what happened that day and what life is like now for them there were times that people would be doing this new thing were everything is political. We had a survivor talking about women getting passed over for promotions(from a woman who was a high ranking manager) unwanted sexual advances in offices. We had a woman talking about the race of the the pilot on flight 93 and she basically called the story of Todd beamer being a lie. This was such a weird documentary but thats life in 2020+ it can't even be about the horror of that day its about race and woman. I was surprised they didn't talk about abortion. If you take those two woman and that usa today reporter out of it it was really good other then those 3 people.,False

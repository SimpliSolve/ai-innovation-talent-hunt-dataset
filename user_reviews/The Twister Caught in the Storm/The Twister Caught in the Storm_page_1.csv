1,8,"Real People, Real Event. This is NOT Hollywood!",imdbfan-9650281432,n/a,15/08/2025,"Someone committed how they were disappointed about premise being about people, not the tornado. They even said the characters were annoying. What's wrong with you?! This wasn't doesn't done for your entertainment. These people were not actors. This was incredible first accounts about people who experienced one of the worst tornadoes in history. The fact that they LIVED to tell it was amazing enough.I felt this documentary was well done! My heart was racing through most of this documentary. I was emotional and driven to tears. This was shown 13 years after the event. The way they pulled together cell phone footage and actual sound. They were able to create the experience intertwined and was so descriptive, your mind could fill in the rest.I can't believe society is so jaded by Hollywood, they are unable to feel the real.WATCH THIS!!Be prepared. If you live in the Midwest, you will NEVER ignore those warning sirens again!Hope this documentary wins an Oscar!",False
2,8,Emotional look at Joplin,chebosky,n/a,15/08/2025,"Your enjoyment of this documentary of the historic tornado in Joplin will largely depend on whether you prefer more personal stories with amateur shaky footage or if you would rather see a glossy production with lots of expert talking heads and raw data. I tend to prefer the former because it takes a massive event and scales it down to the personal level which to me is much more powerful. I can relate much more to individual experiences compared to boring discussions of weather patterns and historic precedentI'm not sure why they picked these individual stories to tell. Almost all the accounts are from people that were teenagers at the time, but I think it was a good choice. When you are that age big events like this can completely alter your outlook on life and the future. I wasn't equally interested in all the accounts, but it gave the story a decidedly emotional element that would be missing from many documentariesThe footage is chaotic and a lot of it is just cameras pointing at the sky with no particular focus on the tornado, but it highlights the chaotic nature of the event and helps build tension. You won't see a lot of footage of the tornado ripping through houses or CGI reenactments of its path, but it goes along with the personal nature of this story as a lot of the footage was taken by those being interviewed or camera footage from the areas they were atHowever, it could have used a little more context information. It really didn't accurately portray the sheer devastation and destruction of the town. Most of the time is spent building up to the tornado and the moments during with very little time spent on the aftermath. There are no maps showing its path or any overhead shots of the whole town with the line cut through it, so it's a little hard to put the whole thing in perspective for someone not familiar with the areaUltimately, I got unusually emotional watching it which is my sign that it worked. Many documentaries explain everything in a clinical way with lots of facts and talking heads, which can be good, but I tend to prefer these more intimate stories that I can connect to on a personal level.",False
3,7,It's interesting and insightful.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"The community of Joplin is hit by a rare force of nature, a devastating EF-5 tornado, a natural event that has catastrophic consequences.First off, the negative reviews, are you guys serious? You must have watched something different to me.161 people dead, this was a horrendous occurrence, but aside from that, how many lives, properties, businesses, structures etc were impacted and ruined by the damage.It's very raw, very gritty, but very heartfelt and very human, don't expect the glass and nonsense of the recent Twister film, most of the footage is strictly audible only, but would you expect otherwise?It's not glossy, it takes a bit of time to open up, and for us Brits, it's worth remembering that The US is a bit more religious than us lot over here.One thing I will never understand though, storm chasing, I just don't get it, don't mess with Mother Nature.7/10.",False
4,6,Apparition of a Monster from the Sky,samabc-31952,n/a,15/08/2025,"According to NOAA, Missouri experiences approximately 50 tornadoes annually, while the Tornado Valley region comprising Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma, reports around 300 tornadoes per year. The St. Louis area is particularly prone with 12-15 tornadoes occurring annually. While the peak tornado season spans March to June, tornadoes can strike at any time.Missouri has witnessed several catastrophic tornadoes in recent years, including the devastating Jefferson City tornado (2019), Carl Junction tornado (2017), Oak Grove tornado (2017) and Perryville tornado (2016). These events resulted in extensive damage, injuries and loss of lives.(Ref: Google)This documentary provides a gripping account of the devastating effects of Joplin tornado on May 22, 2011, in Joplin, Missouri. It was a devastating EF5 tornado that caused widespread destruction and loss of life. 158 people lost their lives in the tornado, including 7 students and 1 staff member from Joplin High School, over 1,000 people were injured, many critically, caused $2.8 billion in damages, making it one of the costliest single tornadoes in the US, nearly 1/3rd of Joplin was destroyed!!!The documentary features personal storytelling, stunning footage and interviews with storm chasers and meteorologists. Witness accounts and survivor stories recreate the monster tornadoes in vivid detail. A scary yet good watch!",False
5,7,Review of the reviews!,needairsoft,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary details the utter devastation caused by a tornado in Joplin back in 2011.Unfortunately for some viewers who left reviews complaining about how awful the footage was, the awful people that were interviewed the religious aspect and whatever else they could find to moan about. It's indicative of the damage social media has on weak minds, zero attention span chasing that dopamine hit because they were bored by the survivors stories of being trapped inside a tornado with footage to boot. Evidently it's not enough to satiate the next generation of people that will find something to complain or be offended by. Not one of them stopped to think of the 114 people dead, the inpact on the survivors some with life changing injuries and let's not forget the entire community of Joplin that was basically erased of the map. Family homes local businesses. None of that was considered, they just moaned about the lack of entertainment and the 'grainy' 'YouTube quality footage'
Why are so many people so selfish and lacking in empathy nowadays? This is a documentary about lives and a community devastated by a REAL tornado. You do not have the right to criticize and refer to the interviewees as 'yokels'.Look at your own lives before criticizing others for sharing their story! Shame on you.",False
6,n/a,Surprisingly good,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is excellent.I grew up in Minnesota so am no stranger to tornadoes and the fear you feel when the sirens go off.161 people died in Joplin and the city was obliterated.I went into this not knowing what to expect and am so impressed by the first person storytelling - and that is what this is, a diverse group of young people (at the time) describing in detail and with original videos what happened to them.It's terrifying.I don't want to say much more as it will spoil it. Needless to say the people we come to know through their stories survived (one extremely luckily), but many others did not.Joplin and its people are scarred but they persevere.This documentary is two hours long but it flies by. It is never boring. And the stories are mesmerizing.Recommended.",False
7,6,I don't know if I got more scared of the twister or of the fungus,alexgs1,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a documentary about the devastating tornado that destroyed a town in the US in the last decade. There are some footage of CCTVs and from some locals' mobile phones. They also give their testimony about the day that looked like the end of the world, a day people had not much time to protect themselves in shelters or other safety places.I don't know anything about tornados apart from watching Hollywood movie, Twister, so this documentary is interesting for me to give some information about such natural disaster that does not happen in my country, thanks God.However what gave me creeps is to see the poor young guy who got his body infected by a flesh-eater fungus that can only be treated by removing the affected body tissue. Then you can imagine what's the consequence on one's body. I'm so glad he was able to recover and build his life as an adult with a beautiful family.",False
8,8,You a weather junkie? Watch this!,missyjax,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFor weather geeks, there's nothing more riveting than raw footage of catastrophic weather. Even with shaking cell cameras, those cloud formations were truly beautiful and truly terrorizing.That said, I had a minor gripe that others have mentioned. I was expecting something more like Deadline to Disaster (great TWC series on violent weather with cell footage and random people telling their stories). This was too focused on a very small group, which resulted in too much ""filler"" material.I would have liked some other 1st hand accounts, including LE. There were lots of stories to tell after that May day in June 2011.",True
9,4,Should be called - The Twister through the eyes of morons,scottsego,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe footage was thrilling and offered a captivating view of a monster tornado. That's it. The rest features stories from people who grew up in tornado alley, and they just somehow figured all this out? From the hairband couple that drove straight into it, to the meth users with bad teeth who were out joyriding while it pummeled the town and getting sucked out of the car window, to the child and mother from California, where the mother had a weather-obsessed child who didn't even know what a tornado siren is? I mean seriously, this kid lived through severe weather, tornadoes, and everything related, yet mom was completely oblivious to it.... C'mon. Last but not least, the gay yogurt shop teen was the worst.... So dramatic in all the wrong ways. Again, great footage, but the people are unbearable.",True
10,8,Horror in a matter of minutes,kagiso_14,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary captures the raw devastation caused by the disaster-destruction that is heartbreaking for so many people.What stands out most is the incredible strength of the Joplin community. Despite the overwhelming tragedy, the film highlights the city's strong support system and resilience.While there are many blurry videos and images, this actually enhances the film's authenticity. Rather than using staged footage, these visuals genuinely reflect the extent of the damage and the chaos that unfolded.Ultimately, this documentary tells a powerful story of unity in the face of horror.",False
11,7,Some missing information.,imdbfan-27249,n/a,15/08/2025,"They only covered the main of the significant parts, there's tons of stories, especially there's stories of kids that were caught in the tornado and talk about how these butterfly people came down from the sky (angels) saved and protected them, even first responders, the national guard, nurses & doctors got tons of stories and first time experiences with such of a event like this, especially there's a marine who was called home from basic training right when the tornado. If I was a director and a journalist I'd want to hear more experiences than just 5 individuals. Especially the amount of damage that was done there's stories about the reconstruction even over 1800 companies that reached out to help Joplin.",False
12,5,A story about people. Not about a tornado.,florisklaver76,n/a,15/08/2025,I was expecting a documentary or report style story of a large tornado. Instead this is a report of stories from people who experienced the tornado. It's non stop interviews with people who lived through this big natural disaster. The first half of the 90 minute movie is just these people talking about their lives leading up to the moment of the tornado.While this concept in principle can be entertaining none of the characters are interesting or captivating enough to really connect with. Some of them I even found annoying. The emotional moments and silences while the shot zoomed in felt forced. It was hard for me to keep my attention on the screen through this.,False
13,7,Decent look at the Joplin tornado,kjkbhill,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you find tornadoes to be intriguing, you will generally like this documentary. The first hand accounts were the best and most frightening parts of the show. There wasn't much point to the kid meteorologist wanna be though. I didn't think it was relevant. There was a lot of build up and then it seemed very rushed. The ending with a little blurb about global warming and more intense storms was unnecessary. The producer could have done a quick search and learned that 2011 had the most F4 and F5s then the last F5 was in 2013 and hardly none since then. So that little ending info really wasn't necessary. I liked ending on a positive with the football game but it could have also included a better look at how the city looks now and how it recovered.",False
14,6,Interesting but didn't blow me away...,souplahoopla,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can't quite put my finger on why I didn't enjoy this documentary as much as I thought I would.A lot of this documentary is very interesting. It's all first hand accounts, with lots of footage people took at the time and some CGI renderings to illuminate their stories.I think the lead up was well done. It really made it clear that the people of this town were so used to tornado sirens that they really didn't take it as seriously as they should have done.I think where it starts to falter is that the stories seem to be exclusively from the people with footage, all very young people bar the weatherman. It doesn't have stories from anyone else in the area; people in their homes, people who lost everything, people struggling to survive who didn't happen to press 'record' on their mobile.It also seems to go into the back stories of these people for some reason. Depending on the subject matter, it can help explain a story. But I'm not sure why being shy or being gay is relevant to surviving a tornado? If they were concerned about runtime, it would have been more interesting to explain the fungal disease people suffered after in a bit more detail, or how people managed to afford the rebuild.I think, to me, this felt like a college student documentary. Interesting but a little skin deep. It's worth watching but, if you're like me, you'll be a bit disappointed.",False
15,8,Attempts at uniting through tragedy,gpromom,n/a,15/08/2025,"There is no doubt that what these people experienced was life-changing. These were stories of survival against all odds or rather against a seemingly unsurvivable monster tornado. I don't think I've ever read, heard, or seen an eyewitness account of anyone who survived being drawn into a tornado and survived flesh-eating bacteria. Those who complain about too much focus on religion are probably not complaining about the clips at the end with then President Obama visiting and talking to the residents of Joplin. That survivor is gay, religious, and happy to have had the President there to acknowledge their suffering and their community. Cecil is someone who unites people. He did his best to help keep others safe. He is a decent person. His beliefs and lifestyle might not align with yours but only God will judge us in the end. Until then, leave your prejudice behind and try your best to imagine what these people endured on that day.",False
16,6,"Slow start, captivating testimonies but...",valdigilio,n/a,15/08/2025,"Once again, Netflix turns one of their products you think is going to be about what is advertised (tornados) as an opportunity to advocate for their lifestyle ideologies. Leaving aside the clear propaganda throughout and the climate conclusions at the end, the fact that this really happened and the real footage makes it interesting and sobering. Might be worth the watch, to honour what happened... maybe. Wouldn't watch again.While the testimonies are well edited ans aome are more compelling than others, the general pace is slow. Someone here said it was moving but it didn't feel very emotional to us.",False
17,10,I Felt a Bit Like I Lived Through It,PhillipJarodNelson,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved movies like Twister but they're fun, exciting Hollywood whereas this was real drama and horror. We're taken on a journey through the events of the day, escorted by people that lived through it for real. There's shots created for the film to bring bits to life but most of it used actual footage from cameras at the time. You can practically feel the storm through the videos and feel the emotions of the survivors that relive it with us. I felt a touch of the anxiety and fear just watching it, almost like I was right there with them. It's not supposed to be a lighthearted popcorn flick. I can't recommend watching it enough.",False
18,6,Basic,schmittfalte,n/a,15/08/2025,"Twister is a recent Netflix documentary that covers the tornado events in Joplin, and while it's informative, it doesn't offer much beyond the basics. The documentary gives a decent overview of what happened, and it's nice to learn about the impact the storm had on the community. However, the approach is very standard. There's nothing particularly unique about the way the story is told, and it feels more like a recap than a deep dive. The visuals and interviews are okay, but they don't really pull you in emotionally or reveal anything that hasn't already been shown in similar weather documentaries. If you're someone who has a strong interest in tornadoes or storm tracking, this might be more your thing. But for a general viewer looking for a gripping or memorable documentary, Twister falls short. It's not bad, just very plain and forgettable. One of those titles you watch once and don't think about again.",False
19,1,Was expecting more documentary,msubears-11724,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having lives nearby this tornado and having seen the devastation shortly after, I was a little disappointed in this production. Maybe I was expecting more facts and perspectives. With so much national attention and news coverage I would have expected to see much more footage of the whole town and the damage as well as more discussion about the science behind the tornado and its rarity. The stories were touching but was so focused on three different people's experience that it missed a ton of other perspective. Was so looking forward to this releasing and it just fell short. It being the worst tornado in over 64 years I feel there is a better documentary out there somewhere.",False
20,9,Powerful,shannone1,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a powerful, well made documentary told by real life survivors. It was raw and emotional. It's probably the best natural disaster documentary I've seen. I live in Michigan and we do get tornadoes now and then, but nothing like they do there.I can't help but admire the strength of this community, particularly the people that were featured. It couldn't have been easy for them to relive this tragic day. I enjoyed the different points of view, especially the teenage weather forecaster who was visiting Joplin with his mother. He immediately recognized something was happening before most of the adults around town did. This story is full of heros!",False
21,7,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Twister: Caught in the Storm,burlesonjesse5,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""The worst thing that could happen"". Well that would be a hardcore vortex of violent liquidation and neato cyclones. Poor Toto, his exterior terrier, and Uncle Henry didn't stand a chance.Anyway the flick I'm about to review starts off as a little pretentious, with interviews by some local yokels who think Joplin, Missouri's ""you know what"" doesn't stink. Then The Twister: Caught in the Storm kind of grows on you, like big-arse fungi as a toadstool, showing the devastation of tornadoes in a town of 51-plus thou. ""Auntie Em! Auntie Em! It's a twister!"" Indeed.""Caught in the Storm"", yeah it's shot mostly in MTV style, like watching Ridiculousness, Road Rules, or some antiquated version of Teen Mom. The film doesn't need no stinking middle-agers, numerous protective parents, or grandpappies, just a dozen or so millennials who seem punch-drunk just to get their 15 minutes of fame.Yeah there's archives from 2011 in the form of flashbacks, flash forward probes that are raw and unrestrained, and a burgh devastated by dust devils like Hurricane Katrina on steroids. The Twister: Caught in the Storm is a dense, documentary slice of Middle America, Americana. Rob Dyrdek rears his proverbial head while Mother Nature gets triumphed over.So is ""Caught in the Storm"" a masterpiece in the realm of desolation, docu dramedy? Uh, not quite my weather nerds. I mean why should Joplin, MO get all the sentimental love when so many other places have been torched by the throes of nasty, freewheeling tempests (I live in Illinois so the funnel clouds of Washington come to mind). And is The Twister: Caught in the Storm edited crisply and storyboard-ed to maximum effect? Oh fo sho. Director Alexandra Lacy is stealth in gradually delivering the trauma even if she's stuck in pop-cultured, grungy 90s residuum. ""Storm"" trooper.",True
22,2,Disappointed.,imdbfan-8467499475,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary fell flat in every area. If you were hoping to see footage of the tornado, a detailed description of the damage, or anything else remotely interesting, you will also be disappointed. This story chooses to follow a few different survivors that spent more time discussing their personal lives that had little to do with the actual tornado or storm.Instead it was apparent the documentary was produced mostly to push religious ideology and political propaganda.If I wasn't already familiar with the particular tornado, I wouldn't have a clue just how much vital information was left out.",False
23,10,Very moving,jan-17135,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a deeply moving documentary-unexpectedly emotional. I watched it out of interest in tornadoes but didn't anticipate the intense roller coaster of emotions. The storytelling is gripping, blending the raw power of storms with human experiences in Tornado Alley. It's both fascinating and heartbreaking. The footage is incredible, the personal stories unforgettable. I'm glad I watched it, even though it left a heavy impact. Joplin's devastation, especially the destruction of its high school, adds to the tragedy. Never heard of it before in such detail. RIP Willdabeast and all the lives lost-your stories won't be forgotten.",False
24,9,Engaging and enlightening.,shiwon-92297,n/a,15/08/2025,"A fantastic perspective of a natural disaster.I'm an avid fan of all things environmental and meteorological and adore a good disaster movie. But every time I watch one, I wonder what it's really like to experience something so powerful.The fact that the people chosen to interview were all such ordinary kids doing ordinary things made their stories so much more relatable and compelling. Them being from different backgrounds and with different interests and dreams made their shared humanity and compassion for their friends and families all the more apparent.I loved hearing their individual perspectives of a shared experience. Terrifying, heartbreaking and yet still hopeful.As for those who are offended by the mentions of god - Joplin is a midwestern/southern border town. The people are reflective of the community - I'm not sure what you'd expect! And, as someone who is decidedly not midwestern or southern or religious in any way, I'm sure if I were in a life threatening storm, I'd be praying to something...",False
25,5,Better than expected,greatandimproving,n/a,15/08/2025,"First-hand accounts of the monster tornado that ripped through Joplin, Missouri in 2011. From people at work to meteorologists, storm chasers, visitors from out of state, students at graduation and locals on the road, we get an array of viewpoints to put that night in perspective. It starts out like any other natural disaster doc before we're given actual footage from cell phones, security cameras and the like, at which point it becomes more real and unique. The storytelling is solid, the pacing tight, and the melodrama not overdone. I thought it was well produced for a Netflix project.I even liked the name: not Twister, but THE Twister. Forget about the rest, this is the tornado you need to know about, this one takes the cake- along with the buildings and cars and all worldly possessions within a five-mile radius. But not the town itself. Joplin's soul was sheltered the whole time, and lived to share its story here.""It went from we were chasing the storm... to it was chasing us.""",False

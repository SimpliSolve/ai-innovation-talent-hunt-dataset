1,8,Daddy made you some content,youngcollind,n/a,16/08/2025,"Birthed from a spark of insanity, it's amazing that Bo Burnham's ""Inside"" was able to connect with so many people. Crazier still that he managed to assemble an even more out there version and convinced us to watch him go through it all over again.It wastes no time pointing out how absurd it is to have behind the scenes footage when the cast and crew are only one man. It takes the opportunity to bring things in an even stranger and more meta direction. Like the kaleidoscope of bad takes, or the time he gets distracted and looks at his phone, forgetting to make the very media you are in the process of consuming.It still includes a surprising amount of A grade material that didn't make the cut the first time around, and some of the more fleshed out moments rank among his best bits. He just has such a unique talent for digesting pop culture and spewing it back at you. It began to dawn on me that this probably won't age particularly well as it's very reflective of the times. However, a lot of comedy is made for the moment, and it's kind of refreshing to realize how far in the rear-view mirror the lock-down is starting to seem.",False
2,8,Honestly surprised,minutolo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen I heard about this when it came out, I thought it was gonna be a bit lackluster. However, that was not the case. I was laughing my socks off the entire time. The outtakes are just as funny as the finished product.While some of it is literally just behind the scenes footage, there were rejected songs and sketches that never made it in due to time constraints or other reasons.Personally, I really liked the other Bezos songs and the alternate take of All Eyes On Me. The sketches were funny, too. He really nailed it with the podcast sketch, I gotta be honest with you guys. Go ahead and give it a watch, but only if you saw the first one.",True
3,10,A great addition and BTS of Inside,lukaptrvski,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you enjoyed Inside, chances are you'll like this. If you didn't enjoy it, then you're probably not here anyway, so who cares lmao.Regardless, adds interesting context to 'Inside', further blending the line between performance and reality in a much more comedic way.",False
4,10,Outstanding,jvmencia,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have seen this BTS of INSIDE about 7 times now, and it is just fantastic. There are so many bits in here that are iconic, and I loved the extra materials that were in here. Personally I really liked ""The Future"", which was more towards the beginning of the video.",False
5,10,Bo Never Wastes a Moment,doonkovlog,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've noticed how he uses every chance he gets to turn a piece of our attention into his art. A joke, a song or a message. Someone with that level of consideration for this ADD generation deserves massive recognition, in my uneducated opinion.I think I'm caught up now on Bo's catalog. What., Make Happy, Inside and now the Inside Outtakes. From the moment he exploded onto stage like the rockstar he is at the beginning of ""what., I've been intrigued by what he may do next.The Inside Outtakes surprised me simply by how generously entertaining it is. Even the ""slower moments"" pay off wonderfully.",True

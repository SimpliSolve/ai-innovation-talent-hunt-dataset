1,5,Directed well but theres nothing new.,ryanconduit,n/a,15/08/2025,"I suppose for anyone who hasn't been following anything to do with Jeffery Epstein much would find this hot gossip and juicy news. In some areas maybe but all up alot of the documentary besides some small easy to find information on her own case is just rehashing old news. I think its very fair to say you dont really need to watch this to know whats going on which is quite disappointing because there should be so much more to say. The quality of the documentary is good for it does have, it explains things well and still keeps things interesting. I would have rated this higher if it didn't feel like one of those doccos that was just made for the sake of making. From a Journalist prospective I believe more effort could have been involved.",False
2,6,It's Pain for your eyes and vibe (sometimes),AvocadoSteve,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt could be a beautiful continuation of the series ""Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy rich"" but they maybe did not have much solid information about Ghislaine. Documentary switches scenes between 90's and present events and clearly performances of lawyers, therapists and victims themselves! This really ruins all the credibility of documentary. Non-actors perform, it looks horrible, and we should believe them in the next scene? It can't be done!Anyway you can still fill your knowledge of Ghislaine and Jeffrey. Just prepare that it will be pain to sit through a few scenes. For example a scene of lawyers speaking with each other and the camera work exposing that the whole dialoge is cut and clearly staged.",True
3,6,Partners in crime...,LekyLekz,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's hard to judge this documentary and it would be pointless to repeat the scenario that most people interested in this documentary already know. On one side, the story itself is infuriating, showing how status, money and power gave both Jeffrey and Ghislaine the opportunity to do whatever they pleased. Can you imagine how egocentric and psychopathic one has to be to think they could get away with grooming and using young girls for their own sickening pleasures?! On the other hand, the documentary touched base on many topics surrounding this case, and while it lacks depth, there is enough details from Ghislaine's former friends, as well as recounts of some survivors that make this documentary a solid watch.",True
4,7,"""We've finally been heard""",paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""Ghislaine Maxwell: Filthy Rich"" (2022 release; 101 min) opens, it is ""August 10, 2019"" and Jeffrey Epstein has just committed suicide while in jail. The immediate question: where is Ghislaine Maxwell? 18 (!) months later, she is found in New Hampshire and immediately arrested on multiple criminal charges. At this point we are less than 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this is a sequel or companion release to 2020's ""Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich"", which I have not seen (I really don't want to know any more about that guy than I do). But when the same film makers announced this project, my interest was a little peaked: what had possessed this woman, at one time Epstein's partner, to become a relentless recruiter and groomer of young (many underage) girls to provide to Epstein? This film goes into that issue at length and offers some possible explanations. Along the way, we also hear from several of the victims themselves, and why events some of which happened as long ago as 25 years continue to haunt them. Most tellingly for me are also a number of Maxwell's acquaintances from back in the day, and the bizarre behavior she showed even then. Several of the victims state that Maxwell was in fact worse than Epstein. Most importantly, one of the victims, when asked her reaction after Maxwell's conviction, observes: ""We've finally been heard"". Very true. How is it that these terrible people were able to do what they did for DECADES, despite the numerous complains by the victims as early as the mid/late 1990s? Just shocking. Bottom line: this documentary provides a very sobering, if not outright shocking, look at a socialite who decides to become a child trafficker, all to please her (ex) partner...""Ghislaine Maxwell: Filthy Rich"" premiered on Netflix this weekend. If you have any interest in learning why a woman of means decides to become a child trafficker and groomer, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
5,6,Unerwhelming Documentary,keikoyoshikawa,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAnytime we get more exposures about stories of horrible crimes is a good thing. The Jeffry Epstein story was always incomplete without his partner in crime, Ghislaine Maxwell. I don't know how much has been covered about her; aside from this film I have seen only one other.I suppose there is a certain fascination with the rich and especially the rich who turn out to be horrible criminals. Unfortunately, this documentary doesn't really tell us about why she turned out to be the way she was - a convicted sex offender and child trafficker. There's no new information here.Instead, we get laughable stories about her sexual appetite that rubbed some people the wrong way. She was more carefree about sex than some people, so she must be bad. Her father was a womanizer, so she must be bad. Was this film commissioned by the church? Seriously.The only good thing about this documentary are the interviews with Annie Farmer and Liz Stein, the only victims who have been publicly identified. And also ""Mary"" an unidentified victim. Without these I would have given this underwhelming film at best two stars.",True
6,7,Bad people,MickyG333,n/a,15/08/2025,"6.7 stars.I don't rate documentaries above a 7 usually, because the overall experience must be taken into account with all my ratings. A documentary is very informative, but it's not something I will watch more than once, at least not 99% of them. There are very few I'd re-watch. Anyways, enough of that. The point is any great documentary will only provide a limited amount of entertainment for me, and even with all the great information, I must still be entertained. I watch TV for that reason primarily. And so, is this a good documentary compared to most? I suppose it would be if it was something fresh, but we already knew all this stuff, it was just a matter of time. And so this documentary is average at best, but not too bad.Ghislaine was probably the real monster behind it all. She coordinated all of this for him, sure he was a very bad man, but he was not necessarily the mastermind. Or, maybe he was the mastermind, but she was the person who made his wishes come to fruition. He needed a charming woman to put his ideas into motion.We can see from a very young age that she was this sort of an organizer. Her friends talk about her being so charismatic and the life of the party and she knew how to throw parties and get people together for a purpose. When she had an agenda, she knew how to make it happen and how to put things together and she did it for Jeff, because she wanted his approval maybe, but that's no excuse.",False
7,6,Not enough,dlaughlin-90046,n/a,15/08/2025,"There just isn't enough here. The show is way too short. It gives you an idea of what kind of horrible person she is and of course the twisted relationship her and Epstein had. I don't believe that if they had never met they wouldn't be near as bad as they are together.Now what they did to these under age girls was so awful. I think Epstein got off easy and avoided punishment by committing suicide. I hope she is in jail for the rest of her life. That being said some of these adult women I think just might be looking for a payday. They are adults can't they say NO. It's not like they were threatened with bodily harm or death. One even admitted taking $200 and then cried saying she didn't have the words to say stop or no. Just because you may be uncomfortable in a sexual situation to me that isn't assault that's just regret. If you just go along with it and don't say I don't want to do this how do they know you don't really want too. Not only that but if you are put in a creepy situation and you really didn't want what happened to happen then why in the world would you go back over and over again. Your an adult a grown woman if you had been assaulted, taken advantage of, then don't go back. To me that sounds like you are choosing to do it again. You may think back now and go, I really didn't want to do that, hay that means I am a victim. That diminishes the real victims. I just don't think it was a very good documentary. It's like I didn't get the whole story.",False
8,3,Left out the truth,ameliaask,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a film about the young girls Maxwell delivered to Epstein. But there was more going on.There was an island, there were powerful people flying to the island. Girls were groomed and provided for these powerful and wealthy people.It left out the other powerful people affected - with the exception of a prince Andrew.The documentary focused on Ghislaine, going from past to present. It discussed her family life, her father who died (fell of yacht) and how after his death, huge discrepancies in his companies' finances were revealed, including his fraudulent misappropriation of the Mirror Group pension fund.More could have been done to honestly explore her interesting childhood, her upbringing (father Jewish, mother protestant), career with her father, what she was like growing up etc.It was shallow and focused somewhat on her life of glamour without delving into the details of her repulsive psyche. It offered no insight or truth.",False
9,1,SERIOUSLY?!?!?!,pirate-46945,n/a,15/08/2025,"Interviews with ALL these ""ex"" friends of Ghislaine coming out now? Hmmm, where were they when all this stuff was going down? Now all of a sudden every ex friend of hers wants to tell their story. Pretty sure these people were either involved or knew what was going on! SO many ""ex"" friends talking out NOW 🙄. Give me a break, they knew and are just as disgusting as her. They even say they saw ""signs"" but did nothing. Seriously?! These are people that knew her VERY well and they're just now coming out saying stuff? They knew the whole time and were probably a part of the whole thing. They're just ""finally"" speaking out now to make themselves seem innocent.",False
10,8,"Incomplete, though Interesting",Sarah423,n/a,15/08/2025,"In other documentaries and news reports we've heard all about this general story from the point of view of people investigating Jeffrey Epstein. The scandal that crossed social and international boundaries, unbelievably continuing in spite of police being contacted for decades.Epstein's ending, of course, felt emotionally incomplete since he committed suicide before his victims could have any satisfaction at his punishment.---Here, the documentary focuses on Ghislaine Maxwell--convicted of crimes related to the entire scandal. She was a willing partner in crime, according to the court.So here, ineffectual though it is, you'd think we'd finally find a point of ""closure."" A point where victims and viewers both could feel like the story was completely ""told""For one thing, the winning attorneys are having none of the earlier attempts to paint her as an additional victim. Which is an interesting journey, since there were earlier attempts to deny Maxwell is a predator herself.They make their case well.---However, what's STILL missing or incomplete is the full scope of the ripples going out from the Epstein-Maxwell cases. The CEOs, the wealthy, the complicit who need to explain why they didn't speak earlier when they first realized what was going on.(Or will some few make the case that they simply didn't. In which case a discussion is needed on why that could be)Thus, for the limited focus the movie attempts, it's successful.But there's still more of a story to tell.",False
11,1,Records exist,dcassis,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are literal records of people who visited Epstein's island. Until they are made public and every single name mentioned in them investigated rigorously, this will be one of the most blatant misuses of power that the general public has been made aware of, and then ignored.Make no mistake. This entire saga is no more an indictment of the people responsible than of the people who take it with a proverbial grain of salt.We know these crimes persist. There are more billionaires with islands and resorts and ranches and they will not persist with their monstrous crimes.This isn't a success. This is a sad proclamation that we can do nothing to affect change to how the rich and powerful choose to live.",False
12,4,Engaging while misdirecting. A good effort.,albedo21,n/a,15/08/2025,"Genuinely liked the amount of interviews & information provided. All very curated however, and while I can't fault what limitations the show-runners had to deal with to get so many interviews with ""family & friends"" of ghislane, this film stinks of propaganda.At the end of the day Ghislane was thrown under the bus, more or less, to quash public curiousity & outrage. Same deal in this film as far as I can tell, except they add some sympathetic story threads for her.Watching this film will not change anyone's mind who believes that Epstein was killed to send a message to others. The only story anyone gets to hear is that he was the devil, and NOTHING else happened.",False
13,4,"Predictably no new insight into GM, Manipulative & Nothing illuminating if one only has barely followed the case",Benzo1818,n/a,15/08/2025,"I struggle with parts of this case. I do not struggle with anything that has to do with 14 yo girls. However I do struggle with aspiring models, actresses & massage therapists acting completely shocked at being propositioned for sexual favors in return for money. The Jeffrey Epstein version interviews Annie Farmer's sister who was/is an artist & was receiving gifts, being put up in mansions to nothing but her art, etc & then at a certain point was propositioned for sex...ran in to a room and barricaded her self & left...but then allowed her younger sister to go there & surprise surprise the same thing happenedI guess my heart is black because it seems like anyone with half a brian & a bit of savvy would not accept any of these ""gifts"" w/o assuming there would eventually be a quid pro quo & at some point the giftee would want something in return.Of course I'm only speaking of the women that are of age(which varies drastically from state to state & country to country. In fact 16 is the age of consent in most states in the USA). Maybe my ego is low? But did these women think that they were so amazing that people were just going to sponsor their careers, academic goals at the tune of thousands of dollars because they were so smart and interesting? The world is FULL of people doing very demeaning things for far less money.These docs also put their finger in the scale by showing old photos of these women either years prior to the incident, or when they have no makeup on & look their absolute youngest.I also would not be surprised if the reason we don't hear about all of the other ""friends"" of JE/GM is because there are secret settlement negotiations going on with them to keep their names out of the media.Toward the end of the ""Documentary"" I found it very rich for an Attorney w/Jeffrey Boice's history to say something to the effect of ""...these people need to be heard, powerful people can't...blah blah...""...Boice was one of the attorneys that AMBUSHED Tyler Shultz(the main whistleblower of the Theranos case)at his grandfather George Shultz's home in an attempt to force him to recant & sign NDA documents. An event that basically wrecked Tyler's relationship with his grandfather.I realize attorneys are going to do attorney things & are essential(esp being questioned by police in ANY facet. ALWAYS say you want an attorney present...no matter what). But it's a little cringe when Attorney's that mostly have represented the uber wealthy bang the table for the little guyAnyway in the zeitgeist of our times, there is no way a documentary delving in to this case &/or subject matter can even dip its toes in the balanced waters. The closest they came here was reading some of the cross examination & immediately calling it ""rough"" or ""harsh"" when I'm sure everyone of those attorneys would have taken the exact same plays from that playbook had they been retained by the other side.I liked the small bit that talked about Ghislane's background. Being an American I wasn't as familiar with her as I'm sure people from the UK are. But nothing else was really illuminating if you've even just barely been following the heels of coverage this case has gotten(seems like the media almost trying to make up for dropping the ball on the original JE conviction?)All that said I give this a 2/5...on par with one of the better episodes of the crappy, paint-by-numbers American true crime shows like ""Dateline"" & ""48hrs""",False
14,10,I'm giving 10 stars,blemmel19,n/a,15/08/2025,"But not because this film deserves it. Why are these women not naming the names of the politicians and CEOs that they were trafficked to? Who will br brave enough to say the names? Ghislaine was on trial and the victims testified against her and yet only she and Epstein have been charged with crimes.And so the only prominent john we know about is Prince Andrew, and only because there is a picture of an underage Virginia Giuffre with his arm around her shoulder. The only reason we don't know publicly about anyone else is because these other encounters were not documented.That should tell you everything you need to know. Read between the lines on anything Melinda Gates has said on the topic. She essentially threw her ex husband under the bus and said he was among the same ilk as Epstein. Yuck.Let's not forget about David Boies who represented Harvey Weinstein and attempted to smear his victims before he went to bat for Epstein's victims.",False
15,4,Uncomortable viewing - but I just felt there was still more to say,joebloggscity,n/a,15/08/2025,"There is a very sensitive subject to this documentary, which admittedly is not the first, and I wholly acknowledge that. However it has had the benefit of access to some names more closely linked to the subject matter than some other documentaries.For those in the UK, this entire scandal has been an eye opener, and Ghislane Maxwell is only part of the story, however this doc is supposed to delve deep into her psyche but I don't think it succeeds. I personally found it mostly shallow in that respect. I don't think we found any true answers. It goes without saying our disgust on what she was wholly involved in, and this documentary really I felt struggled to give us anything new to spear her with. Her psyche wasn't investigated enough.There are a number of very good aspects, and my due respect to the victims and those who assisted them in their journey to win justice. I just felt that there was more to say and provide information, and this documentary just felt as if when it tried to attempt to give an overview of Ghislane Maxwell it never said anything what isn't much already known or was just guesswork. I just feel there is more disturbingly to this story.I assume legal reasons limits what could be delved into, which is frustrating but as long as she is not made some icon, then the better for it. I feel this documentary thankfully avoided that and did well in that par.In any case, I found this not the most helpful documentary. She is (understandably & correctly) a new public hate figure, and she will hopefully serve the rest of her life behind bars. There are though others involved still to be challenged on their involvement and so this should not all stop here. To her victims, my respect to you all, and I hope further justice for you and everyone affected.",False
16,1,Emotional Manipulation to a Shameless Degree,nataliewelcome,n/a,15/08/2025,"Women (and men) recounted stories of being propositioned for sexual favors. Minors were mentioned, although evidence of crimes against those minors was scarce.This films presents as a team of prosecutors and others who seem to use emotional tactics to convict in a court of public opinion.I believe that Ghislaine Maxwell is guilty of crimes against minors, but if I were on a jury and this content was the extent of the prosecution's evidence, not guilty would be my verdict...and I'd stand on that decision, saddened by the potential miscarriage of justice, shaking my head.Maybe the prosecution delivers compelling evidence in the courtroom.As for this film, even a man was complaining that G. Maxwell had made sexual advances towards him. Is this supposed to be evidence of criminal behavior? See the Cole Hons interview around minute 106.In another instance of lacking evidence, one of the prosecuting attorneys spoke of a victim by saying, ""...she was extraordinarily young when she was recruited by GM...""What does it mean to be extraordinarily young? Is the person two years old? Is she negative age? I concluded that his claim was more emotional manipulation.Later, we find that the victim was 14 at the time of the alleged crimes. Then, we have no further information. How was the girl recruited? Where were her parents? What were the circumstances?I found the whole film to be a pursuit of emotional manipulation rather than a delivery of facts that speak for themselves.Shameless.Can we go this hard against the celebrities and the world leaders who used Epstein's and Maxwell's services to exploit minors and to traffic sex workers? Where's the documentary that calls them out?",False
17,3,Nothing new here. I await the naming and shaming,busterjack-82681,n/a,15/08/2025,"This felt like a re-hash of another documentary about the same woman that I watched a few months ago, with hardly anything new in terms of scandalous revelations. While I don't doubt that Ghislaine Maxwell deserves to spend the rest of her life in prison, it's difficult to ignore the nagging feeling that she has been hung out to dry as a scapegoat. There are many super-rich individuals who are not being named even if we can guess at the identities of a handful of them.So I found this latest Filthy Rich 'documentary' a total anti-climax, although in fairness it would be interesting if you haven't seen any previous offerings from other production companies.And I wonder if I will live long enough to see the as yet unmade Filthy Rich documentary that, for once, really exposes the scandals we haven't been told yet. That would be worth watching.",False
18,8,Verdict,kosmasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"No pun intended - it seems that many followed the trial(s) of Epstein and her ... I for one did not. Well not closely - so quite a few things were new to me. Maybe that is why many feel differently, because the documentary may not have too much new information for them. Talking about new information: I would have loved it if they were able to include more of the ... well subject of the movie! It is about her and we only see archival footage of her ... and other people talking about her.They do paint quite the compelling ... or rather full picture of her. Not sure what she would be able to say to defend herself ... not much you say? Well yes - very likely. But some view point, some inside would have been lovely ... well not lovely lovely ... you know what I mean! Not easy to watch or hear ... crazy to think this was happening ... and probably is still happening somewhere else ... hopefully not to this degree ...",False
19,3,Only a monster would wear stilettos on the beach,kayhansen1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm not saying she didn't do the things she's accused (and was ultimately found guilty) of doing, but these testimonials from prior associates and ""survivors"" don't really tell that story.They selectively tell the story of a person who, like frankly a lot of people in the 90s/80s/70s, was riding the 'Super Freak' train.There's the adult store clerk ""survivor"" who Maxwell hit on/pursued/made uncomfortable with salacious advances; the adult massage therapist who, because she was abused as a child, found herself unable to say 'no' to Maxwell's sexual advances; a group of adults to whom Maxwell proposed a party game where blindfolded male guests were to fondle the breasts of female guests.Discomfiting, inappropriate, kinky, yes ... but criminal?Again. Not saying she didn't do those other things. After all, she was found guilty in 2021 of child sex trafficking.I just found this documentary to be pretty thin.I quit watching after the photographer's testimonial. He tells the story of a photo shoot Maxwell arranged to promote her ocean conservancy efforts. The shoot takes place on the beach and Maxwell shows up wearing her 'save-the-ocean' tee shirt and ... gasp ... stiletto heels!The photographer bows his head pensively and sighs.'If only he'd recognized the signs,' his sad, faraway gaze seems to say.",False

She saw all the access she gained from it, and it became second nature to her. She continued to play the same role in Jeffrey Epstein's life when her father passed away, but as she grew older, she was unable to fulfill his needs and moved from being groomed to grooming. I understand that Ghislaine appeared trustworthy to these girls, so they followed her orders, but we also have to consider that the majority of these girls were in their early twenties and enjoyed the luxury lifestyle they were exposed to until they had to return the favor. Nothing is free in life. I'm not blaming the victims, but they were aware enough to know that easy opportunities don't just come by there's always a catch.",False

Once again the contraption of the media and the powerful people behind it is obvious and disgusting how they continue brainwashing , controlling and manipulate the masses which sadly they will only process what the media will feed them. Utterly disappointed for the 1 and a half hour wasted of my life.

24,5,Give me a break,pgwerner66,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched it because I was interested in knowing more about the background of Ghislaine Maxwell, and there is some of that here, but not much more than I'd get from reading her Wikipedia bio. The angle that it took toward the victims and the trial was, what can I say, all too typical of the post-MeToo sexual landscape. So there's a mixture here of the testimonies of actual victims - women who were minors at the time or were otherwise genuinely forced into sex, and self-described ""survivors"" who are simply cashing in and who lay it on pretty thick. Basically, these are people who were grown-ass adults and had every opportunity to say no to Maxwell and Epstein's advances, and instead claim to have been coerced based simply on the couple's wealth and creepiness. I guess exercising one's agency is too much to ask for in an adult. Also, the nonstop outrage from the prosecuting attorneys that Maxwell was even allowed to make a defense in court is a bit much.This documentary has the reverse effect on anyone who isn't outright prudish about unconventional sexuality - I'll even admit that I came out liking the younger pre-Epstein version of Ghislaine Maxwell, who at least comes across as vivacious and adventurous, which in a better age would be considered admirable qualities. Far more so than the teary-eyed and put-upon types whom the doc is supposed to be guiding my sympathies toward. Also, far more than her old ""friends"" and their newly-struck outrage and ""we should have seen the signs!"" rhetoric. However, through her teaming up with Epstein, she went from someone who was simply adventurous and unconventional to someone who committed very real crimes against children and ultimately deserved to have the book thrown at her. I would have really liked to have seen a better analysis of how that transition happened, but all we're offered in this doc is a bit too pat of an analysis about how her father was a really bad guy and she was looking for something similar in Epstein.",False

1,10,"Enlightening, Tantalizing, Exciting & Scrumptious!",crowes-18865,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been waiting for this documentary forever! My love for Kirk goes back to the 80's when family and friends could not understand that when I spoke of Hot Lips I was not talking about Houlihan from MASH but Kirk Cameron with his good looks and his expertise which ranges from Christmas, Easter, Passover, Rosh Hashanah, dirt bikes, pear trees, pickles, clothes pins, Styrofoam coolers, po' boy sandwiches, river pebbles, German culture & history, homeschooling, aardvark anatomy, canine behavior patterns, stone cutting, origami, history of the Kmart Corporation, professional paddle boating, salami production, shiatsu massage, tantric touch and connection, dill cultivation, moral and ethical judgement, Dabney Coleman's filmography, Corey Feldman's medical history, Bobcat Goldthwaite's bm schedule, Planters Snacks sales metrics, the history of all sweaters, khaki pants manufacturers, Bollywood movie extras, professional dodgeball stats, eternal fate of every man, woman, child and animal alive now, etc. I could go on for weeks but the bottom line is this is Kirk giving it to us straight even when it's hard and we need to learn how to take it. It might hurt a little at first but once we let his truth inside of us we will never return to our prior complacency. Let Kirk in people, open up and let him inside!",False
2,10,If you're considering homeschooling...,jessicaacrow,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film should help to encourage you and reassure you that you ARE smart enough, creative enough, organized enough, and just plain ENOUGH to homeschool your own child(ren). Jump in with both feet, the water is amazing.",False
3,9,Pretty good,kimberlygoeman,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie more or less followed 15-20 families on their journey to homeschooling. My group and I enjoyed most of the families, although there were a few who did not seem authentic. All in all- I would recommend, especially for families considering homeschooling, as it does a good job at presenting the many ways you can homeschool.I am really leaving this review in response to another reviewer who made a false claim. While Dr. Kathy Koch does have some masculine features, she is absolutely not transgendered. Perhaps the reviewer put her name in to google and mixed up Dr. Anne Koch, who is trans. I would hate for Dr. Kathy's name to be tarnished because she is an excellent, God fearing woman. God chose me to be who I am, as I am when He made me."" -Dr Kathy Koch.",False
4,9,Train up a child...,Cover-Lover,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watching The Homeschool Awakening made me wish I had at least tried to homeschool my children when they were young, and it inspired, encouraged, and motivated me more than I expected, since my kids are well past their school years.It is easy to relate to the parents at the beginning of the film who felt kind of weird about homeschooled kids-thinking they probably weren't socialized, their parents weren't adequately equipped, etc. But when Kirk Cameron said that he is responsible for what is put into his children's heads and hearts it really impacted me.My children are now grown with children of their own, and this film has inspired me to create learning opportunities with my grandchildren. I love the thought of filling their head and hearts with what I feel is important. There are so many opportunities to teach our children (and grandchildren) other than in a school setting. I'm so inspired and motivated that I want to go pick up my young grandson and take him to the park, grocery store, river, etc. And teach and learn new things together with him.In this film, Kirk Cameron chronicles what it takes to embody adventure, freedom, thinking outside the box, finding the 'type' of smart our kids are, discovering their learning strengths, embracing relaxed learning, and having fun. He also confirms that homeschooling is doable.I truly feel smarter for watching this film. That's quite a statement, I know, but it illuminates so much about educating and equipping our children and discovering what will help them thrive. What a privilege it is to be a monumental influence and guide for our children's wisdom, character, knowledge, hope, and faith in the ways of God.Train up a child in the way they should go...Many thanks to TBN & CamFam Studios for providing a sample of the product for this review. Opinions are 100% my own.",False
5,10,Interesting,d3afb0y,n/a,15/08/2025,"I learned something but not all. I find it interesting about how parent struggling to teaching children education but part of Christian and more about freedom, social life and more of experience. I enjoyed it and i know teachers are not perfect at school but things crazy happen at school out world but homeschool is safe and spend time with kids and find something you haven't done and creatively, sometime you might not like it. Sometime you might like it. Whatever journey you travel journey like road trip and exploring and what kids want their goal for future and want to have good life. It not about being perfect. It is about learning and having experience; i enjoyed it.",False
6,10,Encouraging,luisandrachel,n/a,15/08/2025,This was a very well put together documentary. I'm so glad I had the opportunity to check it out! Kirk Cameron did a wonderful job on displaying why home education is important. Almost a year homeschooling and this is just what I needed to keep pursuing this path. Very encouraging and motivating!,False

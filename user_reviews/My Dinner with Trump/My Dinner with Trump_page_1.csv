1,7,I couldn't stop watching,Erik_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a more authentic view, I think. The cameras are on and everybody knows it, but it doesn't have the reality TV vibe until the second half.It's nice to see politicians and government folks actually put food in their mouths, with forks and stuff. It was also nice to see Trump in a sit-down scenario instead of the usual, rally venue.Was anything exposed or is there any new information? Not really.What makes it interesting is the style of it. It's clearly, heavily edited, but still an interesting watch, if you are interested in the real life of politicians and the sycophants who follow them.Sweet; I hit that absurd, character limit. Feel free to just read the first two paragraphs.",False

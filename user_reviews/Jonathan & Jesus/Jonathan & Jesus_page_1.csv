1,9,Should have been called Fame,melissacravensmarketing,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a documentary that has Jesus in the title, one would expect a string of theologians and historians to weigh in. But this documentary is about Jonathan Roumie's experience in playing Jesus. Consequently, the breadth of this series is actually wider than the title might lead one to believe. In navigating the intersection of faith and fame, Roumie actually interviews several people, mostly musicians (because Roumie's first love might actually be music), who have had to learn how to live out their faith while being famous. Incidentally, Alice Cooper gives the best description of extreme fame during his segment that we should all keep in mind when it comes to celebrity culture.Along with familiar celebrities, Roumie also speaks with faith leaders like Francis Chan and a missionary working with refugees in France as well as other faith leaders.Alongside following Roumie's daily life, a sometimes fraught journey to meet the Pope, and an international promotional tour for The Chosen, the crew interviews people whose faith in Jesus has lead them to combat racism, sexism, and human trafficking. In dealing with fame and faith they interview psychologists and health experts, some of whom openly admit to being non-believers, which was a surprise in this production pointed squarely at The Chosen core audience.The biggest surprise at the end is the video of a story that Roumie tells pretty much any time anyone asks him about how he got the role of Jesus in The Chosen. It is a powerful reminder of God's faithfulness, but also illustrates why SAG-AFTRA went on strike partially due to how residuals were paid.",False
2,10,Watch this and then TELL OTHERS!!,dapegster-74936,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow! What an amazingly insightful, beautiful look into Jonathan Roumie's journey and continuing journey of his faith and his role portraying Jesus. I came here as a fan of The Chosen and left inspired to dive even deeper into my own faith not only because of Jonathan but all of the other individuals that he crossed paths with during the series. What a wonderful gift. I also need to compliment the industry people who took this journey with him. From camera to production to editing and beyond. The ""feel"" is fantastic! Please don't keep this series to yourself. Rewatch and then share with others!",False
3,10,Superbly done!,marvahardage,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an excellent piece of work! I applaud Jonathan for his willingness to allow such vulnerable parts of himself to be shown. He is a kind and beautiful soul whose love for God shines through. The Chosen shows us Jonathan, the actor. This docuseries shows us Jonathan, the man. This has been long awaited by his fans, and it did not disappoint. It brought laughter and tears. It's a refreshing change from so much of the anti Christian content that is so prevalent these days. Jonathan Roumie does not shy away from exposing his devotion to God, and he encouraged the same boldness in others. Well done!",False
4,10,Even better than I imagined,valwauthor,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have followed the rising career of Jonathan Roumie since 2019 when I first watched The Chosen. At the beginning of 2020 he began an online prayer group and I don't think I missed a single session, even though the practices of our Christian faith were different. That's one of the things Jonathan taught me. That opening my mind also opened my heart. This docudrama shows how hard he has worked and how the unexpected fame has affected him. I already knew he was walking a rocky path but I really had no idea how hard the struggles were. And in case you think the persona is all acting, you're wrong. I met him once in person and what you see in this documentary is exactly what you get. Jonathan Roumie is more than an accomplished actor - he's an extraordinary human being.",False
5,10,Bravo! Blessed be God!,sunaa-33277,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jonathan congratulations on your success and the success of The Chosen and Jesus Revolution. To say that you carry a heavy load is a gross understatement. I hope that your conversations with all the folks in tis series and others will give you some clarity, peace and an understanding of how to carry this. God has brought you to this. He will walk you through it. Take time for you, what you need and what brings you peace. Your sister Olivia and im sure your whole family are with you on this journey. We are all with you on this journey and thank God for you everyday! Blessings my friend. Thank you for sharing your heart.",False
6,10,"Wait, an interesting documentary?!?",cathyhughesforjc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ok, I do love a good nature show. But most documentaries about humans that are currently living are dry, uninteresting shows that I would never watch. But being a huge fan of The Chosen and Jesus Revolution, I decided to try this documentary. Boy, was I surprised! Not only interesting, but so fascinating to see the different experts weigh in on what it would be like to portray Jesus, and just what that might look like, as well as who Jesus is to modern day society. Whether you are religious or not, the historical person of Jesus has had an impact on YOU, and knowing how that happened, or why, is something I would highly recommend finding out about through this show. And of course, if you The Chosen or Jesus Revolution, this is a perfect complimentary show - just like the study books or Behind The Scenes.",False
7,10,Inspiring and humbling,nshininger,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerOne of the best documentaries I have ever seen. The devotion that Jonathan and so many others in this show have for the Lord is utterly inspiring. Each episode was crafted perfectly to focus on the appropriate theme and I love how the last episode focused on surrendering to God.The final moments touched me so much as Jonathan cried after almost running out of money and willpower. The many ways in which God works in our lives is a mystery but so beautiful. It was also wonderful to see Jonathan profess his love for the Catholic faith as I am a practicing Catholic myself. Cannot recommend this documentary enough!,True
8,10,A Masterpiece You Must See!,judibwroe,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the moment I saw Jonathan Roumie as Jesus in The Chosen, I knew there was something different in his portrayal which compelled me to know more. His powerful, emotional testimony of surrender, deeply changed my life in an instant. Since then, I've prayed with him and for him while followed his budding career. And can testify this docuseries is genuine Jonathan- continuously seeking a deeper walk and understanding of Jesus. His sole desire to honor God and incorporate his faith into every aspect of his craft continues as he maneuvers his growing fame. The docuseries is raw, genuine, intimate, and transparent, showing the true heart of a man of God, as he meets with musicians, scientists, those ministering to the homeless and fighting trafficking, seeking insight through their experiences. You can't watch this without wanting to be a better person. Beautifully crafted. A must see.",False
9,10,Jonathon Roumie carries the role or Jesus well.,myfaithlasts,n/a,16/08/2025,"I originally watched the docuseries Jonathon and Jesus simply because I am a huge fan of The Chosen and of Jonathan Roumie. However, I quickly got wrapped up in the stories and interviews within this show. It not only tells Jonathon's story, but also the stories of the people he encounters. I really loved seeing Jonathon explore the heavy weight and responsibility of what its like to portray Jesus. Because I am such a big supporter of The Chosen, and really liked watching what Jonathan goes through as he plays the role. I think it must be incredibly difficult to do, but as this documentary shows, although Jonathan can struggle with the immense role he also relies on the Lord to get him through it, he has people who help him, and he handles it with such grace. Jonathan is a fantastic actor and is my favorite person to have ever played Jesus. Jonathon and The Chosen have made the real Jesus so much more real to me and such a bigger part of my life. It has helped my relationship with Jesus and my desire to know Him much stronger. Jonathan- I know this is a difficult role for you to play- but thank you for pouring your heart and soul into it and for what you're doing to show Jesus to the world. I am so grateful. Thank you for allowing us to see behind the scenes of the challenges and rewards of what you're doing.",False
10,10,Such a powerful docuseries!,jlm-28954,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not one for tv but I do watch The Chosen so was interested in seeing what this was about. It is must see for anyone who is familiar with The Chosen or even anyone who is interested in Christianity. It shows how Christ reaches so many people but also doesn't shy away from the issues Christians can have. Moreover, it really shows the heaviness an actor takes when playing a very important (the most important) role of his life as well as how fame can drain a person. Well worth the watch - I binged it over two days and I don't binge anything. I strongly recommend anyone interested in Christ, The Chosen, and/or acting too watch.",False
11,10,A Must See!,mynewlyfe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fantastic docuseries about the blessings and pressures of playing Jesus. This series documents the journey of actor Jonathan Roumie, who portrays Jesus, the most famous man to walk this planet in the series The Chosen.From his humble surrender to God asking for guidance, his acceptance of the role in The Chosen, to his visit with Pope Francis, the series shows a side of fame that few actors have achieved. How do you maintain your identity when many people actually think you ARE Jesus Christ?Roumie's care and concern for playing this important role weighs heavily on him, and the series does a great job of illustrating just what it's like for a man go from struggling actor to being mistaken for the actual Son of God. A devout Catholic, Roumie exhibits his devotion and passion for his faith while also learning and praying for people of all denominations.Filled with interviews from historians, religious experts and even Alice Cooper, the series is both entertaining and moving as it follows Roumie from place to place all around the world as he promotes The Chosen.You don't have to be a fan of The Chosen to thoroughly enjoy the journey of a ""regular guy"" learn and grow as he is recognized more and more, not as himself, but as Jesus Christ.",False
12,10,what a witness to the power of surrendering,mclane-65988,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI live in an elder community where surrendering independence, eyesight, mobility and even beloved colleagues is an everyday experience for each of us here. Jonathan had already inspired me/us to the power of surrendering through his words and acting career. This documentary pushes that witness over the top! Bringing so many others to share their stories (loved Anthony, Sheila and the ""other"" Jonathan especially), and including such intimate moments of his own (the envelopes! The security tag! Fr. Fulco!) makes this documentary quite profound and binge-worthy... surrender is the key and this is the proof it is possible with God's help... now excuse me since I need to watch it again! And we need season 2!!",True
13,10,Me and Jesus,crl-88384,n/a,16/08/2025,"If I could give it more than a 10, I would. So heartfelt, everyone needs to watch this. It has really helped me see life through a different Lens. Just surrendering myself to Jesus and see where he will take me. Jonathan is truly humbling and to see what he has been through and with such dignity is truly a man of God. So many ppl struggle with the understanding of Jesus and who he was. My faith has always been there, thankful to having wonderful parents who were amazing influence in my life. Being from a family of 17 siblings, being number 16 to the end. I have seen so many addictions, even death and loss of faith in some. I learned young to keep my eye on the cross, but had my share in falling many times my self. Coming back and watching the series Chosen really helped me see Jesus in a different way. Thank you for sharing your life of ups and downs with us. You are bringing so many back to Jesus!",False
14,10,Wow!! Jonathan brings Jesus to everyone,bolsonmft,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved the interviews with people of faith sharing their personal journey to Jesus. Jonathan playing Jesus is transforming him personally but also millions of others. My personal favorite was the taking care of people of the streets and jonathan sharing his personal encounter with surrender. The big surpises was Alice Cooper, The Killers and Sheila E. Each sharing their personal stories of redemption. I think this documentary will impact many people and bring them up close what it really means to follow Jesus. I would like to know how to support the people and organizations he shared. Thank you for sharing this personal insight to your faith and others. Well done!!",False
15,10,Wonderful & Powerful,dellymmoquete,n/a,16/08/2025,Brilliant documentary highlighting a very insightful pilgrimage with amazing conversations with various phenomal people and their stories. A very humbling view into the life of this incredible actor. It shares the point of view of various people from all walks of life and beliefs.

16,10,Insightful and Engaging!,regina-pontes,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the inception to its end, Jonathan & Jesus documentary takes you on a roller coast of emotions. You laugh and cry throughout each of the 4 episodes. Jonathan Roumie is open, engaging vulnerable yet humble man sharing his experience truly capturing the human element of the ""character"" of Jesus he portrays in the global phenomenon hit series The Chosen created, written, directed and produced by Dallas Jenkins.. Jonathan diligently attempts to capture in his humility the essence of the Creator God that is so essential to 1/3 of humanity who call themselves followers of Jesus Christ. Not a small feat to undertake. I loved the diversity of the people Jonathan interviewed from Alice Cooper to Francis Chan and everyone in between. Thank you Jonathan for letting us share in your journey over a year! Give Olivia a hug from us also. Your sister was so sweet in her segment, especially when she was expressing how overwhelmed she is by all you've undertaken and with such humility.Pax Vobiscum Jonathan on your journey.",False
17,10,Beautiful Documentary -A Must See!!!!,autumn-60055,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a beautiful, well crafted documentary that not only shows Jonathan Roumie's journey through his portrayal of Jesus in the Chosen, but more importantly on the impact Jesus has had on not only his life but on the lives of other musicians and other noteworthy public figures. Through it you also get a very real sense of the weight playing Jesus has had and continues to have on Jonathan personally and professionally. It will inspire you to want know more about Jesus and also spark a desire to be apart of Jesus' mission of love and forgiveness and mercy in our own lives and on our communities.",False
18,10,Playing Jesus comes with great responsibility,susansbowles,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this documentary, it is evident how seriously Jonathan Roumie takes the role of Jesus in the series, The Chosen. His journey from basic obscurity to growing fame is another layer of pressure on him. He is open and vulnerable, humble and caring - just the kind of person one would hope for in the portrayal of Jesus Christ. It seems evident that God orchestrated a divine collaboration between Jonathan and Dallas Jenkins (who had his own desert to walk through before he reached the point of surrender. I know The Chosen fans will love this documentary and I think it would be interesting to others as well. Looking forward to the continuing story. Well done!",False

20,10,Definitely watch this!,sashaburgstaler,n/a,16/08/2025,"What is it like to play the role of Jesus? That's a question I've been wanting to ask Jonathan Roumie since I began watching this show, The Chosen. To play a role where you now literally have people calling you out as Jesus has to be so tough, yet to play Jesus has to be such a blessing too! This incredibly done documentary brings you in close for real conversation and interactions that has been his life as the popularity of this show grew. The daily life of ""Me and Jesus"" as Jonathan puts it. Whether you've seen The Chosen series or not, there's something for everyone in this documentary! Thank you to all who put this together and for sharing it with the world! The show is a blessing in troubling times and this documentary is a blessing too!",False
21,10,PLEASE DO MORE SEASONS!!,shaneoliver-63468,n/a,16/08/2025,"First, thank you GOD for this docu-series. Second, thank you Jonathan for enduring the wilderness and sharing your struggle with all of us.I would absolutely love to see this show picked up for multiple seasons where Jonathan visits more Holy places, and / or introduces and interviews more people doing God's work in the real world. Maybe even with information on how to support the charities or ministries that are featured at the end.This show was refreshing and a Real Blessing. There are lessons on unity, faith, and grace. Like all blessings, I only wish there was more of it. Thank you again and God bless you.",False
22,10,INTRIGUING!!,rossjennifer-36199,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thought provoking, intriguing, insightful! A MUST watch!!! Not only a look into Jonathan's life before and after being cast as Jesus in The Chosen, it's a reflection on the history of Christianity and the church. It's multi-layered in the best way. Many experts (both Christian and non-Christian) weigh in on the immense pressure of taking on the role of Jesus. You hear from famous artists, theologians, pastors, rabbis, civil leaders, and more. It will take me quite a long time to unpack all that I've just watched. Bravo to the film makers for creating such a brilliant piece. This must not be missed!!",False
23,10,Best docuseries in a long while-Jonathan and Jesus,marivila-47988,n/a,16/08/2025,Great 4 part series. I watched it twice.

24,10,A must-see docuseries,LeonaHoegsberg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jonathan Roumie plays Jesus on the streaming series The Chosen. But what is it like to play that role and become more and more recognizable in public as Jesus? And who is Jesus Christ? This beautiful docuseries follows Jonathan as he meets Christian leaders, scientists and celebrities to talk about Jesus and fame. We go with Jonathan to ancient cities with great spiritual meaning and to LA where he lives. It is honest, heart-felt and moving. You may get to see the Pope and Alice Cooper in the same series. But what I mainly saw is a special man who loves to act and loves Jesus trying to find answers and come to terms with fame. This is so well-done! Don't miss it!",False
25,10,The Perfect Man for the Role,apalles,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent insight on staying in humility and true to the Lord in the midst of celebrity. When popularity explodes, the unfair demands placed on the players increases exponentially. Very touched by Jonathan's God-centeredness, huge heart, and the kindness and beauty of his soul. It's why he's so believable in the role of Jesus. I have personally been brought much closer to Jesus and to my faith because of Jonathan. I have recommended The Chosen to everyone I know, and all who have watched it have loved it. He carries a huge role and responsibility with great grace and humor. Thank you for this peek into your world.",False

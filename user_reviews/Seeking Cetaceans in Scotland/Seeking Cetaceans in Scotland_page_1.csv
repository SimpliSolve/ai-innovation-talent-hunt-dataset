1,9,Really great documentary,Tostig66,n/a,15/08/2025,"Greg and Flick have done a number of travel documentaries. As well as a magic show. However it's quite clear that the first lock is animals and to combine the travelling with this impressively film documentary about cetaceans is highly enjoyable, you feel like you're on the journey with them.",False
2,9,What A Wonderful Charity!,Travelenthusiast,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was interesting to see a different type of documentary from this filmaking couple who I first watched in their Vlad the Impaler video.The pair do a good job of allowing us to go with them on their adventure and the camera style feels very intimate.What I was most impressed with, however, was their ability to take a step back and make sure that the Cetacean charity at the heart of this documentary takes the spotlight. It is a real insight into what Doctor Robinson's team are doing in the Moray Firth. It was particularly interesting to see how drones allow a chance to see what the dolphins are doing underwater, and there is some really beautiful footage of these playful creatures!",False
3,8,Lovely heartwarming documentary,lisagarbett,n/a,15/08/2025,"Really enjoyable, you feel like you are being taken along on the adventure with Greg and Felicity. You see some wonderful heartwarming sights of these beautiful creatures in their Scottish habitat. Well done to all involved. There was some humour too. Very down to earth. Definitely worth a view, I have learned to have an appreciation of all the wonderful work carried out to study these creatures. Witness how these two caring people embrace learning and new experiences. Share in the incredible experience of witnessing how cetaceans live. I look forward to learning more and sharing Greg and felicity's adventures.",False

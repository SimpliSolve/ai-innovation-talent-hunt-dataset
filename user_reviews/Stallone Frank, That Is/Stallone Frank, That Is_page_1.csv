1,7,Quite worth the watch...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Granted, I didn't really expect much from this 2021 documentary. But still, I sat down to watch it, as I am vaguely familiar with Frank Stallone, being Sylvester's brother and all, and having seen him in a couple of movies. So, naturally, as I was being interesting in learning more about this guy, I sat down to watch this 2021 documentary.And I must say that this was definitely well worth the time and effort. ""Stallone: Frank, That Is"" turned out to be such an informative documentary, and it really shed so much light on this guy for me. I didn't even know that he was a singer.I have to admit that a lot of new things about Frank Stallone was revealed to me as I watched this documentary. And I must also say that after having seen this 2021 documentary, then I am perceiving this man in a whole new light. He is so much more than just the brother of Sylvester Stallone. I am really impressed with his commitment to his craft and art, and also how very talented he is.This was definitely an enlightening documentary, and it is one that I can warmly and highly recommend that you sit down to watch, should you find yourself given the opportunity.There are some nice interviews with people close to Frank, both family, colleagues, fellow musicians, friends, etc. So it is more than just Frank Stallone telling his own story.My rating of ""Stallone: Frank, That Is"" lands on a most well-deserved seven out of ten stars. This was highly informative and equally enjoyable and entertaining.",False
2,7,REALLY Enjoyed!,tsroque,n/a,16/08/2025,"I did not know Frank Stallone was such a big part of my life growing up in the 80's! WOW! ""I'm Never Gonna Give You Up"" and, dang, ""Far From Over?"" And absolutely loved his character in Tombstone!",False
3,7,"Ok, why not.",webwizardbe,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you gonna watch this docu, you already know this ain't about Sly but about his brother. And why not, all his life the world saw him as 'the failed brother', and now you get the chance to see a docu about a talented man with the surplus of knowing how it feels to stand in the shadow of a world star actor.The pace is a bit too fast in the beginning, it feels sometimes like a fast summation. But further I really enjoyed this documentary. Good entertainment with a touch of light drama.",False
4,7,To be Frank,gelvisblue,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interesting documentary. Showed the pros and cons of having a mega star of a brother. Admired, how he plugged on, regardless of the setbacks. Shows the brutality and reality of the fame game in Hollywood and the music business. A great expos√©, with some great input from other celebs.",False
5,8,"Exciting, Upbeat Look At The Enigmatic/Eccentric Frank Stallone",zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"The surname ""Stallone"" is synonymous with show business, but of course that is because Sylvester made it famous after becoming Rocky, Rambo, and generally the biggest action star of the 1980s/90s. What few people may know (or know only derisively), however, is that Sly has a brother--Frank--who is a very talented individual in his own right. ""Stallone: Frank, That Is"" tells his story.This documentary looks at Frank Stallone's ascent in the music business, constantly battling adversity but maintaining a never-say-die attitude and an incredible talent for showmanship. Completely divorced from any Sly-related doings, Frank is a legitimate singer/showman who can perform nearly any genre of music, from country to show tunes and everything in between. He is perhaps best known for providing a large portion of the soundtrack to ""Staying Alive"", the sequel to ""Saturday Night Fever"".Of course, a major theme throughout the doc is how Frank must exist in the shadow of his older brother Sly. Ultimately, the brothers seem to have a good relationship with each other and genuinely respect the other's career arc. While Frank's career was helped immensely by roles in Sly's ""Rocky"" franchise and the Sly-helmed ""Staying Alive"", it was also difficult to escape such lofty comparisons (""Rocky's brother performs"" being a common bugaboo). Frank can very intelligently and compassionately speak to both sides of that equation.Content-wise, ""Frank, That Is"" is a great retrospective of a quirky showbiz career. I wish the doc would have slowed down a bit from time to time to give the viewer a chance to reflect on certain events, but director Derek Wayne Johnson really takes a charge-ahead approach almost at all times. It mostly works, even if not in the upper echelon of showbiz docs I've seen.Overall, though, this is a fun watch. You'll likely learn a few things, get to observe some hilarious (and poignant) interviews with Frank's celebrity friends/family, and probably be able to relate--at least in some capacity--to the themes of sibling rivalry and persistence in the face of strong adversity.",False
6,8,Inspiring retrospective about Mr. Stallone's difficult journey and how he overcame obstacles,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm super excited to share my thoughts about the documentary Stallone: Frank, That Is about a Hollywood star that has seen and done it all. I am talking about Frank Stallone who has spent nearly 50 years entertaining us with his platinum and gold albums and his amazing songs that have topped the music charts worldwide. His movie soundtracks for the most iconic films remain familiar throughout many generations. Singer, songwriter, musician and an actor...Frank Stallone is a package deal!Stallone: Frank, That Is, a documentary written and directed by Derek Wayne Johnson, gives viewers an inside look into the life, career and struggles of a performer who has been dubbed ""the most unknown famous entertainer in Hollywood."" The film takes us behind the scenes as we follow Frank Stallone's professional journey told in words by Frank himself and people within his life who knew him best. Frank's accomplishments seem so remarkable, however for much of his life he has lived within the shadows of his more famous brother, Sylvester Stallone. Being ""Rocky's Brother"" may have been the largest hindrance to Frank's career, yet the most beneficial, because Frank's first real break within the industry came from his contributions to the Rocky Film Series. Frank Stallone's story is one of perseverance, inner strength, and a passion for the arts.Frank's path has been filled with many opportunities and setbacks. Everyone, of course, has heard of Sylvester Stallone, yet, just as talented Frank has remained the Stallone underdog. I believe this documentary is exactly what Frank Stallone needs in order to share with the world exactly who he is, what he's done, and just how talented he actually is. Frank is exceptionally courageous in sharing his deepest inferior feelings and reveals to the world that there is room for more than one Stallone!I truly enjoyed hearing from Mr. Stallone talk about how difficult his journey has been and how he hurdled so many obstacles to follow his dreams. As a young actor, I know firsthand how frustrating and disheartening it is to try to make it big within the talent world. I can relate to the look on Frank's face when as he discusses the setbacks he has faced. The industry is certainly competitive. What every entertainer needs is a will to push forward and a strong support base. The closest people in Frank Stallone's life offer words of encouragement to this amazing entertainer, which I believe is the message of this perseverant film; lots of support and self-confidence are needed if you are going to succeed within this terribly competitive niche. You need to navigate around your obstacles in order to reach your dreams.I give Stallone: Frank, That Is 4 out of 5 stars and I recommend it to ages 12 to 18. Adults would especially love this documentary also, as many of them are quite familiar with Frank's music. Reviewed by Dominic D., KIDS FIRST!",False
7,8,The more talented Stallone.,b4rochoc,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had no real expectations but I suppose I expected some cheesy documentary about a guy living in his brothers shadow.... well, Frank did live in Sylvester's shadow to be fair, and he was screwed over for it. It was no fault of Sylvester's to be fair. Two hard working brothers that were passionate about their art and went their own way. Had Rocky failed its possible Frank still could have reached superstardom alone, or with a band. But at the same time, Rocky helped put Frank on the map too! It's a fascinating documentary and I enjoyed it a lot. I honestly never knew about the majority of acting parts and music that Frank was involved in. It looks like he's a decent impersonator too. I found it funny when he was re-enacting conversations between him & Sly. He'd pull off the voice perfectly. Definitely worth a watch regardless of being a fan of Frank or not. There's plenty of other amazing connections Frank has had over the years that will tell you something about the quality of his talent. I'll be honest, I'm now a fan.",False
8,8,Unexpected,tammyma-13481,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this & I didn't really expect to. He's not just the ""other"" Stallone. He's a gifted artist who just never caught the right break at the right moment. Although upbeat throughout, he (& others) shed a lot of light on Frank & some very emotionally difficult times, which seem to have expressed themselves in depressive episodes & mood swings. He's a committed, driven artist but also a renaissance man with a wide variety of interests. Truly a surprise of a film. The dynamic between the brothers might be my favorite part. So much shared family experience with a difficult father & an eccentric mother plus the usual complex sibling thing. Well worth watching.",False
9,9,Solid documentary about underrated talent,On_The_Mark,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've always been a fan of Frank Stallone. Yes, he would not be anywhere if it wasn't for his brother. He was going nowhere when his brother put him in movies like the Rockys and Paradise Alley. But that doesn't mean he's not talented.Honestly, if you see movies like Barfly and Tombstone, he's a very talented actor and should have had a much better acting career than he did. He's mostly done crappy straight to video type movies that no one has seen and that's too bad. There's no reason why he shouldn't have had parts in big budget real movies.He is talented as a singer and his stuff on Rockys 1 & 2 are great. He had one hit, from Staying Alive. But let's not go overboard, his IMDB profile claims ""Frank has garnered three Platinum Albums, ten Gold Albums and five Gold Singles"" which isn't remotely true. Thing about the IMDB is you can put up anything on your profile and there is no checker to say ""no, that didn't happen.""In the documentary we have all this stuff about his band ""Valentine"" finally reuniting, like this is some big band we've all been waiting to reunite when in reality the only people who care about this are the three band members. And don't get me wrong, Frank is a talented singer but all his successes singing are as a result of stuff his brother helped out. He had no big record that wasn't part of a Sly Stallone movie. The other thing I have a problem with is Frank is a producer of this documentary. Who produces a documentary about themself? It's like you're making a commercial about yourself.Now the thing about this doc which is great, besides the fact it does have a lot of great talent in it - is the pace of this thing. This is how you make a compelling documentary. It moves. Super fast. There's no fat, coming in a 112 minutes. And that's good. I really enjoyed this. I think Frank IS a talent guy as a singer and actor. I'd like to see him get a good part in a real movie and have more success as an actor. He deserves it.",False
10,8,Frank was a musician before Sly was an actor.,rofthorax-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary gets better after the first 15 minutes.Once you realize he was involved with John Oates before
there was a Hall & Oates, in the 60s, you realize that he
has a lot to be thankful for because he's seen the ups and downs
quite a lot more than the average rocker trying to make it big.He eventually realizes, as does the documentary ""Find your way"" about
buskers, that simply playing and making music should be where his
interest is and not trying to get someone else to approve of it or
give him a record deal. In the ""Find Your Way"" documentary
it reveals through several interviews with musicians including the lead singer
of POTUSA that getting a record contract usually makes the music making
process complex especially if you are under the gun to sell a hit record.That documentary says the best way to make it as a musician, is to busk,
until you find what is comfortable, some people can even retire
from a life of busking. Frank's rise reminds me of Andy Summers experience
of trying to make it big until becoming the guitarist for the Police. He was a decade
older than the other members, and it only took three albums before they
broke up. Frank reformed the same band several times before he got a
combo that sounded good together. I wished there was more in the documentary
about his style of playing, maybe a sampler of his best compositions, rather than
just interviews of friends, maybe some opinions from long time fans, maybe
elaborate on his involvement with john oates and daryl hall, like what it was like to
be with them, and what that philly music scene was like. I really feel like it could have
covered the rocky road in forty minutes then elaborate on his music.. I really
feel like I was presented a resume but not really a taste of his dynamic art.",True

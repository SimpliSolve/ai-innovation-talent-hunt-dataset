1,10,Lovely,kluun-18684,n/a,16/08/2025,"I expected an entertaining documentary, instead I left the cinema overwhelmed and feeling a bit sad. We tend to see the rich and famous as special. Louis shows us that a famous rich football manager can also become sick, feel sad, feel pain, the documentary humanised him for me. Also the moments between Louis and Truus are so adorable, wish there was more of that in the movie.",False

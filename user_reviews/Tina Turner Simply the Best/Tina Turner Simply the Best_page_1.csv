1,n/a,a kind of anthem,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"A powerful , provocative, seductive and pure energetic declaration of love.A precise - honest self definition.And a great song , great in each moment for the voice of Tina Turner, for the horse as symbol of life, for the lyrics reminding not only a feeling but a way to build your life. This makes it more than a beautiful song, almost a sort of anthem, seed of impressive show and a source of courage.So, each time I hear it, I feel it as kick to assume the life, challenge by challenge. And, not doubts, this is the basic motif to be just grateful to this very special singer and her admirable art.",False
2,9,Her inner strength shines through,FilmEnthusiast23,n/a,15/08/2025,"Tina is one of the best entertainers out there--with her combination of performance style, bold voice, and energetic dance moves. Her success over adversity is well documented in this biographic film.The film is a retrospective of her accomplishments at a time when she had to overcome some very difficult circumstances in her life. It focuses on how Anna Ma Bullock became the superstar Tina Turner. The story is fascinating but at times very painful to watch about the physical and emotional abuse that she experienced from Ike Turner. The film delves enough into the painful chapters of her life to help viewers understand her deep courage to leave Ike and to make a new life on her own.The story is chronological, so viewers are taken along on the journey. The film has a good mix of historic and contemporary concert footage of her singing and interviews with Tina, her husband, and other key people. The editing of her story manages to integrate all these things into a fairly cohesive whole. I particularly enjoyed the recent interview footage with Erwin Bach (her husband) and her.",False
3,10,The best,wrightinchicago-231-671840,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow! I've gone full circle with Tina Turner. Read the book, saw the movie, saw the Broadway play, and now this documentary. It held nothing back. Even though I knew the story from beginning to now, this documentary clearly simplified it all. She is the woman of the century. She shows women & people how to overcome and transform their lives. I do wish she had the health and strength to go on a motivational speaking tour. I think she would kill it. She was very lucky to find Ervin and together they have proven to be happy and resilient. Everybody should find their soul mate as Tina has. I'm also glad there's footage of her performances because we'll never see another like her.",False
4,1,The issue here is the narrator is a bot,marksmithpgh,n/a,15/08/2025,"If I am mistaken in my assessment please correct me but it seems this is narrated by an AI bot and is very choppy. The content is good but I cannot get past the crummy narrative. Tina Turner was and is a terrific artist but the producers are doing her a significant disservice by not putting in basic effort to provide a genuine dialogue about her life and work. By genuine I mean a real, thinking individual. Not a bot. The reality is that she had a very traumatic life and the story deserves to be told by an empathetic human being. Again not a bot. I am very surprised that I am the only one that picked up on this. Your thoughts?",False
5,1,"Confusing, badly narrated and misleading",aholzner,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary is badly narrated, seemingly by Siri herself, the same footage and quotes are played repeatedly and don't necessarily match and it contains hardly one minute of Tina's music. Even after a few minutes the low budget production becomes clear.At one point towards the end an interview with Tina is shown with her talking about ""River Deep Mountain High"" but the documentary makes it look like her comments are meant for ""Goldeneye"".It jumps between years in the text, the photos and clips and creates a confusing picture of Tina's life.Reading Tina's Wikipedia page gives a better, concise understanding of her life than this unprofessional piece.",False

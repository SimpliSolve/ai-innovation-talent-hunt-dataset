1,8,The Nitty Gritty of Third Tier Wrestling,Oh_Capital,n/a,15/08/2025,"Oh this is a great series. A struggling C class wrestling organization, a couple of investors shaking things up, unique stories of wrestlers lives, will they make it? Let's find out.Pro wrestling is all about narrative and entertainment, which is exactly what this series is. You don't have to be a wrestling fan to see what makes these people tick. It makes sense, it's fun, it's theater. These people are thespians, but where they lack in acting skills they make up for in physical imagination.The docu-series is 7 episodes that is a countdown to their version of ""Wrestlemania"" called ""The Big One,"" and the point is to get the organization to be profitable or at least break even, if not the investors will pull out.These people live in their own worlds and it's fun to visit for a little while. A series well worth watching.",False
2,8,"Season 2, Please üôè",chris_hirons,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show was awesome. I consumed the whole thing in one sitting and now I'm sad that's it's over. Pro wrestling fans will really like this without a doubt. If you're not into pro wrestling it's hard to say. I'm not a huge wrestling fan as in I don't go to events, buy merch or anything but I do keep up with the results of the weekly shows even though a lot of the main companies are not putting out very good content right now.It's a great show about people blindly following their passion, refusing to give up on their dreams and the struggles to juggle all of that with earning a living and providing for a family. Wrestling fan or not, just give one episode a go.",False
3,9,Fantastic,jerrycoliver,n/a,15/08/2025,"Truth be told...I don't like reality shows, so it was pitched to me as a reality show and I was not interested. Then I saw a trailer and I gave it a chance, and I was not disappointed.It's not a reality show as much as it's a documentary series, and it is seriously a rollercoaster of emotions. The people they profiled, the stories in and out of the ring...just perfect casting. It's incredibly difficult to get a through story just right, and then on top of that, have it deliver. It's one of the those rare moments when the storyteller is the right person to tell the story that happens at the right time and they had the time and money to do it justice.The art and music devices and SFX for the sound (which is always difficult in docs) was top notch. The camera work was great, they really did a great job creatively with the frames in the interviews but also being able to capture the chaos when they needed to.I really don't want to give anything away as far as story but it tugs on your heart strings as much as ""Anvil:The Story of Anvil"" You hate some people, you resent them, you love some people and your heart breaks for them. Just great emotional storytelling about people who are passionate about what they do.",False
4,10,"Thanks God, Netflix, and Al Snow!",barry-154,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show is truly a gift to the world. Netflix has done an amazing job bringing the story of Legend Al Snow, OVW, and so many amazing characters to the big little international screen. A true entertainment gem and power house!The show follows the story of wrestling for the fans and introduces wrestling to those that have never known the beauty of sports entertainment in this form.By focusing on former WWE superstar and wrestling legend Al Snow, this show has the heart, passion, and soul of a lion. Wow, Al is kind, compassionate, and soulfully focused on making this world a better place, while making the entire world a better place. This is what the world needs more of, he is what the world needs more of. Someone who truly cares about the lives of others, while living with such passion, that we can't help but be swept up in the dreams, goals, and smiles that are delivered by Al with a seemless beauty, and effortless empathy.I love every moment of this show, every moment of the lives, every step of the journey, and every message that Al Snow delivers as the nucleus of a true masterpiece of art work.Do not miss this incredible series!!!!!",False
5,10,Heels but in real life (and better),ThaNuggetMan,n/a,15/08/2025,"I went into this show with zero expectations. I am not a wrestling fan. I have seen season one of Heels and am waiting to watch season two on a free pass. This show blows that out of the water. They're both about struggling local wrestling foundations and the characters within them. The fact this all is (somewhat) real makes it that much better.Every character in this show has a great storyline. From Al Snow, to the lowest wrestler on his roster, they're all relatable in someway. Even the people who end up investing show they're not just money, but real people as well. I never thought I could feel sympathy for people who are shown as ""the money"" but this does a great job giving them a story as well. Every episode of this show surprised me in a great way.If you have any interest in wrestling you will love this show. I think most people could find something to like about this show. Even if it's scripted reality TV, it's so well scripted you will still enjoy it. There wasn't one bad episode. One of the biggest surprises I've had turning on a show, then I felt like I couldn't turn it off.",False
6,10,Humanizing and introspective,dogloverlace,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved Last Chance U because it delved into the players' personal struggles and family stories, and it made me root so hard for them individually. I feel the same way about Wrestlers. You can't help but root for HollyHood Haley with her backstory and CashFlo's relentless pursuit of the grind is so inspiring, as are his family's sacrifices. Shera is a beautiful soul and seeing him take such pride in something that most of us take for granted (his pristine Nissan Maxima) was so lovely and humbling. Al Snow is a gruff and stern former wrestler but also seems to be a huge teddy bear and I loved watching him mentor these wrestling hopefuls and being tough but firm. Being from KY I'm heartened to see an honest and not at all demeaning portrayal of the state and its rural communities. The series gets better with each episode and I am honestly kind of sad I'm finished.",False
7,10,Absolutely Fanstastic.,jenniferlimaphotography,n/a,15/08/2025,"I grew up with the WWF in the 80's....going to shows with my dad and my brother. Watching it on the weekends. Renting the VCR compilation tapes. If you were like me as a kid....you will love this.If you don't like wrestling, but like stories about human beings just doing something they love and what they sacrifice in order to achieve their dreams....you will like it.It's a story about wrestling, but it's also a story about people doing something they absolutly love - to their core - and trying to make it succeed no matter what. The directors did a great job not overly editing it to make you love or hate anyone....they show everyone, as they are, the good and bad, as their story unfolds.You know the wrestling shows that pop up locally at the PAL, or schools, or fairs? You will never look at them the same way again...you will see those with a lot more respect that you did before watching this.The last episode of this had me in tears. (Happy tears).Just watch it.",False
8,10,Best show that I have seen on Netflix,losdubs,n/a,15/08/2025,"I hardly ever write reviews, but I had to for this one. I turned this on because I was bored. I was only going to watch the first episode, but I ended up watching all 7 episodes in a row. It is a look at what happens behind the scenes of the Ohio Valley Wrestling promotion. I did not think that it would be that interesting, but boy was I wrong. You do not have to like pro wrestling to enjoy this show. The The stories of all the people that work work for OVW are fascinating and it kept me wondering what would happen next. I ended up rooting for these underdogs to make it and be successful. I was amazed that this show was as fascinating as it was. I pray that there is a second season because I became so invested into what will happen with these people in the future.",False
9,9,a human story about Americana,illrichflips,n/a,15/08/2025,"So surprised how good this was. Absolutely floored by how lucid and calculated al snow is along with caring and extremely genuine. I grew up as a kid in the 80s and 90s watching wrestling until in 96 they put this ppv on from Denver called UFC. And wrestling never did it for me after seeing real fighting... but this show brings back all the good, and reminds you how hard some of these people are trying to entertain you. A story about the struggle to achieve success and the american dream. Well developed and rich in character content (not just the schtick, but the real people you see) Fantastic! Hoping this has a season 2 in the works.",False
10,7,Not a wrestling fan since the 80s,jkerchief,n/a,15/08/2025,"Honestly, I haven't cared about wrestling since I was like ten, but I respect the art and hard work that goes in to it. I decided to watch this on a whim. I live in one of the golden cities that made the WWE/WWF and 2 hours from Louisville and I know just how huge it is where I am. This documentary felt like a really good and long commercial for their cause and I'm fine with that. You can truly see the passion and care that goes in to these people. The documentary is honestly well done. If you're looking for something to watch, perhaps and 80s wrestling fan like myself, this is a nice dive in to a modern day origin story of what wrestling was like. Give it a watch.",False
11,9,The real side of the wrestling industry,andrew-towers,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm 4 episodes in and I'm loving this show. It's both sad and heartwarming at the same time. We follow the adventures of Ohio Valley Wrestling, a C grade wrestling territory that has been around for 20 years or more. It's where many of the WWE stars came from like Brock Lesnar, John Cena ect. Now it's just a shadow of its former glory. The whole show is run by former WWE wrestler Al Snow who is the leader of this rag tag group of misfits. Made up of people who will never make it in the business except for a few who the show focuses on. While it sounds depressing as hell it's not, it's fascinating meeting and getting to know the characters that become wrestlers. There is highs and lows, an owner who doesn't get the business at all and a bunch of people who have sacrificed everything to chase their dream. Just watch and enjoy without judgement because these are all real people who deserve respect. I really hope they make a second season.",True
12,6,Has discrepancies,born_naughty,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Wrestlers"" gives a backstage look at the struggles of running an indie wrestling promotion and the struggles of wrestlers trying to make it to the big leagues. It even shows the human side of the investors involved.It's a documentary but at the same time it feels like a long commercial as well, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. During the course of 7 episodes they try to tell this underdog story though and I noticed some discrepancies.They claim OVW is the C level of wrestling (A would be WWE and AEW, B would be TNA and C is them). They also claim they're the only indie promotion out there that airs (weekly) on local television. Guess they forgot about Booker T's Reality of Wrestling.When Al Snow considers to step in the ring for OVW they tell the story that it's the first time he's had a match in over 10 years even though he's wrestled multiple matches in the years and even months prior to the event.No doubt they this so they could tell a compelling underdog kind of story but this makes me question the legitimacy of the rest of this documentary.",False
13,4,Crybabies,jamespetenbrink-89576,n/a,15/08/2025,"You can tell that basically none of these guys are gonna make it in the wrestling world. They all cry about the guy who bought the company being hard on them and trying to make the company better. Shera has a chance and look at his attitude in this soft spoken no nonsense. Then u get all these guys and woman complaining about everything and the mother of hookyhood girl bringing up if the company got paid is non of her business like the guy told her. Basically non of these people are gonna make it in the real world crying about everything. Could u imagine any of these people working at WWE, they would all start crying and whining about how they r being spoken too. The show is OK but most of the wrestlers are pathetic and I don't mean in the ring.",False
14,10,A fresh take on Wrestling TV shows,rochfordsimon,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFinally a new wrestling show has been produced for international distribution. Its a fresh tale on an old concept.This is Wrestling behind the scenes. The drama, childishness, fun, stress etc. The more interesting part in today's industry.Is what your seeing on this series a work or real? You decide as the viewer. That is the brilliant part. It's Wrestling without the matches.Really enjoyed it and I would love to see a second series.The heels are real life heels. The people that are wrestlers are insecure, backward egotistical, wannabes, talented, hungry, entitled, delusional, passionate and respectful. Many of the the people involved are deep or shallow.A struggling business that would be shut down only for its investors, who are loosing money. The Wrestling people can't make the money themselves to support it. Hence the drama.It shows that a promoter and wrestler are two very different positions. The 'ME, ME, ME' vs the 'LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN' concept.A great show for any entertainment viewer. You don't need to be a wrestling fan. It is so many levels above the dull, scripted TV show 'HEELS' that airs on another streaming service.Thank god it isn't a typical wrestling documentary that tries to show how tough, non-tough wrestlers are or a one dimensional view of the industry in one person's narrative.Doug Basham comes across as a mute in this series. A nodding head that's attached to a statue still body. Doug is a great talker, mover and funny in real life. He had a WWE career and his uncle owned the original OVW. If there's a season 2, he should be more of a focus.",True
15,10,Wrestling Fan or not..well worth the watch.,phenomanimal-10978,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is well directed and edited. I enjoyed this immensely. I was a wrestling fan when younger and do remember the glory days of WWF (now WWE). Al Snow is 100% right when he says over and over in this show, almost in every episode, that within wrestling it is about the storylines. Everyone in here from Mahabali Shera to Hollyhood J are interesting characters and have great storylines. There are many background people we never get to know, but the ones we do, we learn about their stories, backstories and dreams. At one point... I was thinking, because this is sooooo good, was this all a storyline written by Al Snow himself? I mean we have everything in here from family conflict, turmoil's and injuries, fighting ""the man"", redemption, and saving the show at the last minute. Actually....this was better than any script anyone could have written!!!! ...Or...did Al write this all??? :) Either way, well worth the watch !!!!",True
16,9,"Netflix ""Wrestlers"" is a must-see!!",jaredlopez1979,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerJust finished binge watching the series""Wrestlers"" and wow, this series takes you on a cathartic journey of behind the scenes in the wrestling world of Ohio Valley Wrestling. The thing that surprised me about it was how great the story arc was for a wrestling documentary. You follow the CEO of OVW Al Snow, who wrestling fans of the 90's know was a great wrestler in WWE as well as an amazing mentor to young new talent later on in life, as he passes on his years of knowledge in the business to the current crop of wrestlers in his company OVW. The final episode was what really blew me away though, it literally had me in tears to watch all the hard work Al put in to this company, pay off in a memorable way with (Spoiler Alert) the man himself dusting off his boots and stepping back in the ring for the first time in years in order to have a packed house for their big pay per view of the summer!",True
17,10,"Better than ""Heels"" more human than ""Welcome to Wrexham""",RebelYell_659,n/a,15/08/2025,"Where do I begin ?This show is so well produced and presented. A great human story. While everyone has flaws exposed their redeeming qualities help tell a story of hope and hard work. None of the characters act entitled and they have all learned the lesson that success doesn't come without help and support from community.I found myself liking all of the characters or let me say people in the series. The ""heels"" aren't really ""heels"" and the quality of acting is amazing. There are some naturals in the cast. Truth being stranger than fiction makes this documentary even more appealing. Many people look down on the Wrestling community and their fans. Their stories may have been harsher than most but the lessons they have learned have been better. There is no difference between any of us at the end of the day. These ""Heroes"" have learned hard lessons and have realized that it takes a community and a strong desire to succeed. No better allegory than getting knocked to the mat and rising up over and over again. These people demonstrate that hard work is the only path to success and the true success is having tried and done their best.Kudos to all of these wrestlers and all the others who work hard in their craft.Some say wrestling isn't a real sport but the stories and examples in their morality play teach sportsmanship so much better than what we see in other competitive athletic events.Under those tough exteriors we find love, passion, desire, and a taste of humanity people too often shield from others.Highly flawed so many of these wrestlers and people are. Not settling for failure but highly motivated to make their world a better place is where this show succeeds.Much more than entertainment is this story. More human than welcome to Wrexham and more believable and relatable than heels.I give it a 10 out of 10 for documentaries.",False
18,10,DON'T MISS THIS SHOW!!!!,tyler_tackette,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show is awesome! All of the characters are so likable. Even Matt (part owner) who was made to be the bad guy in the beginning, turns out to be a seemingly great guy. I think they did a great job of making all of the characters relatable. It's also a side of the wrestling world that most of the casual fans never get to see. It's the story of a local wrestling company trying to make it big while also balancing the reality of their financial situation. There's and internal power struggle between Al Snow (former professional wrestler and CEO of OVW) and Craig and Matt (who have the controlling financial interests in the company) to put the best product on the mat possible without bankrupting themselves in the process. Awesome job!!",False
19,8,Loved it!,mattturner-37758,n/a,15/08/2025,"Always been a big wrestling fan since back in the mid 80s watching the then WWF so it wasn't a shock that I'd enjoy this series but didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.Never heard of OVW here in the UK but genuinely felt for the lives of the characters in this show, even started to understand Matt towards the end.It's a brutal way to make a living but you can tell all the wrestlers love making the fans happy. They're not perfect, but who is!Favourite characters were of course Hollywood Hally J, Cashflo and without doubt Al Snow.So cmon Netflix do the right thing and give us a second series.",False
20,8,The heart in wrestling,paudieconnolly,n/a,15/08/2025,"The best looks behind the curtains. Of the strange passionate obsessed storytellers that exist within the world of wrestling. Why this is such a beautiful look at the wrestling world is it's not the million dollar contract it's not that happy ever after. It demonstrates a need bigger than money To find a place a people and an existence that feels right for them. This is true of the wrestlers and of the fans that make the journey with them. No true wrestling fan goes for the violence because the worst heel they do you hope to return to the ring The following week. Therefore wrestling in its essence it's always been about storytelling And the people who exist within those storylines inside or outside of the ring. It's a community that is beautifully captured within this documentary everyone of them would love to wrestle for $1 million , But if the offer is $1 probably still going to the ring. Because wrestling is who they are.",False
21,5,"Great show,cool wrestlers,horrible bosses.",mynameismudd-54412,n/a,15/08/2025,"The fact that that weed has been decriminalized in over half the US and the other half have lightened up on it and wrestling is a sport EVERYONE knows is high in drug use why tf Snow acts like people smoking are junkies and it will "" bring down our business "" is sad. It's entertainment. We all know that means partying. That young lady obviously has been smoking the entire time she's been with that company. She's a great draw,great athlete. Cool chick. Snow freaking out acting she's going to ruin the company if people find out she's a drug user is funny af. Hey Snow lighten the f up.her smoking makes people like her more. Being a wrestler and Doing pills goes hand in hand. If you wouldn't have said a word on camera about dude getting busted in the parking lot,no one woulda known or Givin a f if we did. Your like that old guy who goes to church 4 times a week,has no sense of humor or personality. Thinks pot is like heroin and all drugs are evil and weed will kill you if you smoke. Chill out stop acting like your some CEO and treat your guys and girls like freaking wrestlers. Did Hacksaw and Shiek loose fans for doing coke weed and drinking together? Nope. Same with every other actor,musician or athlete who smokes weed or has been busted for drugs. Robert Downy Jr, Jonny Depp,Keith Richards,etc. Grow a pair bud,it's 2024. Mary Jane is legal. No one cares about pills.",False
22,8,Head in The Game,southdavid,n/a,15/08/2025,"I know nobody follows my reviews, but if you did, you'd know that I'm a fan of Professional Wrestling. I had put off watching this series for a while though, as I thought that it might have to be too basic, in order to appeal to an audience that doesn't follow wrestling. There is an element to which that is the case, but still I was dragged in by the backstage narrative.Ohio Valley Wrestling, formally a feeding ground for the WWE, now operates as an independent company, producing a weekly TV show but struggling financially. New owners Matt Jones and Craig Greenburg are debating whether it's viable to keep the company operating and plan a summer tour of the Kentucky area, ending with a big show. OVW's creative director is Al Snow, former WWE Superstar, and his desire to run traditional story driven shows is at odds with Jones, who's looking to cut costs or increase attendance.As with a lot of documentaries actual wrestling is only part of the shows appeal. It does give you a background of how Wrestling works, how they arrive at the angles and how easily it can all be undone by an injury or by someone getting a better offer. Much more the series is about the people involved in the show. Snow is quieter and more contemplative than I thought anyone who performed in the attitude era would be and he comes across really well. Several of the staff and Wrestlers get aspects of their stories show, but the most attention goes to Haley James, a twenty-year-old daughter of another wrestler, whose natural charisma, which could take her all the way, is in danger of being entirely undermined by her damaged upbringing and poor life choices. The nearest the show has to a villain is her misogynistic and bitter boyfriend, who is nearly 15 years older than her and entirely unaware that he's not going to make it.The documentary is given a lot of access, with many of them so comfortable with the blurred lines of reality that Wrestling already has, they are prepared to have personal conversations in front of the documentary cameras. I'm surprised that Netflix hasn't decided to pick up the OVW show, certainly for international distribution. I like this series and watched it in a couple of sessions. I'd certainly watch another run too, if they went back.",False
23,8,Back to my roots,jimgigs,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a 50 something year old that grew up watching NWA, Championship Wrestling from Florida, and read all the wrestling rags, this doc was a treat. As WWE gobbled up all the small regional wrestling orgs, the sport lost its heart and soul. With that I lost my love of the sport. Watching this doc rekindled my fire for the antics, the small venues, the art of wrestling. The doc itself does a great job of portraying the grind these guys go through, all hoping to hit it big someday. Also really gives you a behind the scenes look at the dynamics between the talent, and the owners that are trying like hell to turn this thing around from a money loser to a player in the wrestling world. Al Snow is awesome as the guy that puts the shows together on a shoe string budget. The talent is best described as a band of misfits, all laying there bodies on the line for a few bucks and the dream of hitting it big. The best thing about it to me was how well the talent performed. I'm now hooked on it, watching there events on you tube. These guys deserve to make it, and I hope there are more out there like me giving this wrestling a second look. A must watch for a wrestling fan.",False
24,9,Great docu series,fmd-91042,n/a,15/08/2025,Love Al snow. Always been a fan of his throughout his wrestling career. What I don't like is Matt Jones and the mayor of Louisville get out of the business sell it to somebody else who knows how to really run it the man really doesn't want to wrestle cuz like he said he doesn't want to look bad but you want to push it to try to make money you should have known in the business if you can't make the money don't get into the business. Hopefully somebody will come around and buy those guys out and continue ovw in a better Direction than Matt Jones and his Louisville mayor has it going. But Al snow has it going the way it should be so kudos to Al snow and the rest of the wrestlers.,False

Given I'm well into my adult years and I know how that goes now, its amazing to see it on your TV. I love how in depth they go when it comes to explaining the Wrestlers and their lives. I honestly do not see a flaw in this show what so ever. I like how Al Snow is highlighted on the show. What hes done for the business/training wrestlers, is a whole story in itself. Hes getting the recognition he deserves. This Netflix show has made me a fan to where I will be watching Thursday nights myself.",False

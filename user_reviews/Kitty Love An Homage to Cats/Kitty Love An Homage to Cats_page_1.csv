1,5,Quite boring...,dimpkors,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a big cat lover, but this movie was quite boring. I thought most videos weren't even funny or cute... Missed opportunity.",False
2,6,Cats,MB-reviewer185,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a cat person I only watched this for the cats, so I just put it on and had my cat on my lap through the movie/documentary.Not much to say but you can enjoy watching it for the cats shown through out.",False
3,5,It is like YouTube cat videos. A little boring.,erhanipekciler,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love cats, you can watch but I am not sure you like it or hate it because this is not a documentary, not a movie.. I watched it 1,5x speed. Also I didn't understand why they didn't write Instagram account name of the cats..",False
4,1,NOT a documentary - YT video compilation,innercitypressure,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love cats, but this is NOT a documentary. It's a shameful compilation of amateur clips from dubious quality, that are not even cute or funny, put together with a cringe worthy voice over...
Go to the internet and you'll find much better stuff presented in an honest way.... I'm still shocked that a famous platform was trying to pass this as a documentary next to Oscar winning features.A real shame from shameless producers.",False
5,3,"Omg, no, no, no",MakeMoviesMatter,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a big fan of cats, I'd thought I'd watch this. From the get go, however, this 'documentary' irritated the hell out of me. The voice-over is very annoying, the way she drags her voice all the time. It's supposed to be the cat's voice, but I don't think it fits the cat in question at all. And then the video clips of the cats being shown: these are quite a bad quality and I mean, seriously, 'vertical video' in a movie? On YT, sure, but I would expect better quality clips and also more interesting ones in a documentary like this. I tried, but could not sit long enough to finish the whole thing, so turned it off. It seems like they did not put much thought or work into this 'documentary'. It feels like they wanted to make fast money with the entire cat video-hype thing that has been going on. It could have been so much more interesting and fun, it's a pity.In short: don't waste your time on this, just look at fun clips of cats on social media instead.",False
6,1,You should be ashamed.,gordonjackson-58694,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anyone ANYONE involved in the making, pitching, and distribution of this should just stop. Stop typing. Stop doing what you're doing. Leave the house. Go and lie in the park and think about your wasted lives.The narrator is ridiculously bad. The whole premise is part of the Dutch ""we can do anything!"" mindset which inevitably results in total crud like this passing for entertainment. Must have been bankrolled by old money or a henpecked husband.",False
7,2,YouTube Video Clips,wpjheric-97043,n/a,16/08/2025,"Director put a lot of YouTube clips into this movie, and nothing special, even the name of the movie sucks, kitty love, really!?!?Don't waste your time watching this YouTube film.",False
8,8,A good show for my 1 year old daughter,jlegree-56960,n/a,16/08/2025,My 1 year old daughter loves cats and she enjoys watching the collection of cat videos in this film. This show is more aimed at a younger audience so it's not something I would watch on my own.,False
9,3,Worst of the worst,mrdonleone,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jesus this movie sacks, it is just a compilation of the worst cat short movies from social media, and thereon you generally find better ones than in this album film. Really not good and very disrespectful too.",False
10,5,Woman for the male cat's voice-over,flygirl808,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerWhy did they decide to have a woman do Abatutu's voice-over? He's a male cat. Just doesn't make sense and is highly irritating. Otherwise the movie is ok if you like cat videos.,True
11,3,Mean Spirited Narration,julesrulesfools-39157,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was not a loving homage to cats, and the narration was a non-stop insult track from a rude actress from a famous cat's POV. It was also mostly about one famous cat with a few cat and kitten clips thrown in between unfunny insults. It got to the point where even putting the movie on mute wasn't enough. I joked that a rival famous cat's agent was the mean narrator pretending to be the main cat as a smear campaign. There are also very long interviews about this famous cat that go on and on, which wasn't what I signed up for. It's advertised like a long episode of Too Cute... trust me, it's not and it's not even good on mute because of the long, boring interviews.",True
12,10,Funny,iguanos_fut,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love cats, then you will enjoy it!It's funny, not boring, and perfect for kids.",False

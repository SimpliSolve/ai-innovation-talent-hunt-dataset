1,10,Best Atlantis Documentary I've Ever Seen!,smokeyyunick,n/a,16/08/2025,"Heard about this from Mysterious Universe's (Podcast) interview with Jack Kelley and just had to watch it. Excellent research and well founded evidence. Probably the best documentary on Atlantis I've ever seen.It's weird for such a topic like Atlantis to be kept to such honest evidence. No ufo's, no power crystals, no dinosaurs. Just well reasearched information that people have worked decades on and it shows through excellently with this documentary.By the end of the the movie, my wife (she hates these topics but loved the movie) and myself both kept talking about how the evidence seems so obvious. That I'm surprised most scholars have never found these facts and put them together before!",False
2,10,"The most exceptional scientific overview of the ""myth' of Atlantis produced",dbdmosaic,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Atlantis Puzzle is the most scientifically innovative and exceptionally compiled documentary on the probability of the existence of Atlantis, it's whereabouts in the world, and the lessons that can, and should, be taken, based on substantial details of Plato's writings and discourses. Jack Kelly is compelling, and intrepid, in his work and sets a new standard for excellence in documentary film making. There are so many well-thought questions posed that are both rooted in historical inquiry, existential contemplation and concrete lessons about our very survival. Kelly establishes the most relevant history on Atlantis to date, with a depth of thinking which very rarely is present in any cimamographic project.",False

1,8,A study in hubris and greed....,rjvnatl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are people leaving reviews saying this doc is ""biased"" which is silly and ridiculous. I've seen multiple stories on this event including the other Discovery/HBO documentary that was released shortly before this one. I would argue that this one is the better of the two and actually presents more evidence than the other one. As to the claims that it's targeting one person.... ALL of the blame ultimately lands on one doorstep. Stockton Rush owned the company. He ran Ocean's Gate and all the stories and docs make it clear that it was his show. They all also make it clear that many people involved had made their concerns known and were ignored, belittled, dismissed or fired. And to be fair, the other doc presents some damning things, including the story of another TV program that was invited to film a dive and backed out due to serious concerns about the sub's safety. Also, an incident where the bolts sheared off and the front of the sub fell off and started to slide into the ocean.The hubris Stockton shows towards safety is shockingly clear, and in several instance spoken in his own words in recordings. Someone in another review mentioned ""third party influences"" on the expeditions. The company went out of its way to avoid flagging the ship under any country's jurisdiction to avoid scrutiny. It was the only deep sea sub that wasn't classed/certified, also done to avoid the safety testing and scrutiny. There were so many warnings that carbon fiber was not safe and was going to fail. They were repeatedly warned that it might not survive to depth or would rapidly fail. This doc examines evidence of that and goes into more depth about the test hulls failing and the accoustic signatures of hull fiber failure.I would even say that this doc is more fair to Stockton in that it doesn't show videos of him essentially lying to the paying customers about what was actually happening.",True
2,7,I expected more,drybsh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I actually enjoyed watching the Titan documentary. Overall it wasn't bad. The production quality was good, and the interviews and footage were interesting. However, I went into it expecting a much more detailed explanation of what exactly happened on that tragic day. I kept waiting for a deeper dive into technical aspects and potential causes behind the incident (for that specific day). Only a brief 3-minute was dedicated at the very end to the actual events of that day leaving many critical questions unanswered. If the investigation is still ongoing and no conclusive information is available yet, I personally believe it would have been more appropriate to release such a documentary after the findings were complete. That way, viewers could gain real insight into the incident even through simulations or expert reconstructions of what have occurred.",False
3,7,Too Bad Rush Wasn't Solo,andrealschultz,n/a,16/08/2025,I am sorry the submersible didn't implode when Rush was in it alone. He's obviously 100% responsible for the deaths of the customers. Despicable character.I'm proud of the people who quit the company and spoke out. We are responsible for speaking up when people of authority overstep their bounds.It was very nice to get the backstory of this catastrophe and see that it was entirely preventable if not for the arrogance of Stockton Rush. It's also interesting to see how he replaces the strong people with the yes men and yes women. I hope this is a cautionary tale to prevent this from happening again.,False
4,6,"Very good, but ends abruptly",BIASED4215,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix loves to take their time but thankfully this is a self contained documentary. They got key people involved in Oceangate to talk and do a good job covering the tragedy for the most part. When compared to Discovery's 'Implosion' TV-like documentary it is more cinematic, less melodramatic and presents actual data in an entertaining manner. Unfortunately it just suddenly stops. It shows a Youtuber testimonial then cuts to the conclusion bypassing all the drama of the crew on-board, the botched rescue operation and subsequent media circus. Somehow the inferior Discovery doc has a better closure and a exclusive key piece of footage missing here.",False
5,7,"This Netflix doc is sobering, infuriating & worth a watch...",mdw0526,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix's documentary on the Titan submersible disaster is a gripping case study in hubris. Stockton Rush, the CEO of Oceangate, fancied himself a visionary in the mold of Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk, but lacked any genius and judgment to match (and none of them have much charisma). What Rush didn't lack was arrogance: dismissing safety concerns, ignoring engineering fundamentals, and ultimately dooming himself and his passengers. The film makes a compelling, damning case that this was no freak accident but the result of the unchecked ego of a man who thought he could outwit physics and the immensity of the ocean. It's sobering and infuriating and worth a watch.",False
6,7,Quality Assurance is Important !,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary provides deep insight into the OceanGate accident, including information previously unknown to the public and revealing connections to Stockton Rush.Personally, I would have preferred a slightly longer and more detailed documentary, but overall, it's still a strong watch.It becomes clear that everything was wrong design of Titan and designed around the CEO's decisions - and that he bears the ultimate responsibility. He comes across as an arrogant figure.As someone working in IT as a software QA, I understand how crucial quality assurance and testing are.Throughout the documentary, despite clear risks associated with Titan's dive to the ocean floor, these dangers are not taken seriously. Warnings are ignored, discussions continue, and the tragic result seems inevitable.The dismissal of key engineers further reinforces the recklessness of the approach.In the end, the documentary firmly places the blame on Stockton Rush - and rightly so.",False
7,7,"Good Details and Editing, Not Enough About the Disaster Itself",purplerice000,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a decent documentary that focused mostly on the events leading up to the disaster and on the people within the company. The main event is hardly talked about which was disappointing. The events leading up to it are somewhat interesting and I really liked David Lochridge, the guy tried everything he could but unfortunately, everything and everyone was against him. This documentary is more for behind the scenes of the company but there's another documentary from Discovery that covers the implosion itself better and has interviews with the investigators themselves which I did like better though it is a bit more dramatic than the Netflix one. Overall, it's fine but I think the ending might disappoint a bit.",False
8,6,Sheer Arrogance,rdmceagles,n/a,16/08/2025,"The arrogance of Rush to believe his own hype, and refuses to listen to anyone regarding safety is incomprehensible. He literally took what amounted to tin can into the water and killed 4 people because of his arrogance. Refusing to get it certified so there could be oversight was the height of arrogance. Refusing to register it under any country especially the USA because he knew they would have oversight was sheer arrogance. I'm sorry for the people who died because they had no chance because he believed his own hype. Do you think there was a reason his own wife would not go on any dives with him??? Too bad it didn't implode when he was on it alone.",False
9,8,Very good but incomplete.,sebastien_debande,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found the documentary excellent, great cinematography, good music, it's well organized and the understandably focused on Stockton Rush.The documentary details how we got to this horrific implosion, exposing his stubbornness, his dishonesty, and his charisma despite his relative mediocrity.We get a good perspective on his madness, his psychology, and keys moments of the ""successes"" he had until the inevitable bang.It's indeed very interesting, but it's missing some of the expected results of the investigation. The financial aspect, for example; how dire were OceanGate's finances ? And how much pressure was he under to get paying customers ?Anyway, good job overall...",False
10,6,"Good, But Lacks A Real Conclusion",TheFearmakers,n/a,16/08/2025,"By the time we reach the end of TITAN, to see what the audience is waiting for... the death of the five passengers including infamous Stockton Rush... the documentary is over, which is very strange...It's not that it seemed too short, because it's a good-enough runtime and definitely holds your attention... but there must have been lawsuits pending concerning the families of the people who died. With the exception of the daughter of Mr. Titanic (the one ringer on board who knows about the fateful ship, and who was used to legitimize things)...Instead, TITAN deals with the many, many, many mistakes/misjudgements leading up to the tragedy: so that way they attempt to explain the ending with all the problems of the past... which is somewhat interesting but ultimately a cop-out...Also, there has never been a scarier, more formidable noise than what the submarine was making as it went further underwater... It was like Satan using a pick-axe on someone's nerve-endings...The fact that Oceangate founder/CEO Stockton Rush was able to con all these people into taking such risks is like some kind of unexplainable cult...But even THAT aspect could have been delved into further: not necessarily the good/positive aspects of Rush, but the confidence he must have had that allowed the people to be conned in the first place (from workers to investors), and for so long: It must have been more than money that brainwashed these people... many of them scientists...Instead he's a kind of nerdy impatient scientist instead of the mad scientist they're building-up... whenever he's interviewed it's a bit of a let-down...Meanwhile, since the frame-story involves his former employees in court while delving into all the near-implosions and endless testing of the submersible, what could have been totally suspense-filled, isn't...Except the scenes with actual footage of being underwater with Rush and his cohorts... from another famous wreck to The Bahamas... which has aspects of watching an underwater thriller, like The Abyss...Speaking of, there should have been (more) footage of James Cameron (or perhaps interviews with him) because he was warning people before and after the tragedy, and is far more interesting than anyone interviewed here: he'd have made a perfect Van Helsing to Rush's bloodsucking murderer...And it's very annoying and anti-climactic ending on the second-to-last run with the obnoxious ""influencer"" who resembles a superhero's boxer shorts... too much 11th hour time's spent on him and his fake crying-for-the-camera...So when things sum up, they literally... sum up, and quickly... Probably because everything in this case is still in red-tape limbo...So perhaps Netflix should have waited a few years to make this documentary... which means, they too, like Stockton Rush, basically jumped the gun on a creation that just wasn't ready.",False
11,8,Stockton Rush was a Moron.,heckticstain,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed watching this documentary but the longer I watched, the more I got annoyed with Stockton Rush. There is zero doubt that his is the sole cause of those people loosing their lives. He let his Ego outweigh his common sense(if he even had any). He was an example of someone who is rich that would leverage his wealth and connections to get what he wanted or he would ruin someone's life if he didn't. He should have been the only one on that Sub when it imploded. There were problems all along the way and he kept ignoring them and wanting to push forward. If someone didn't agree with him he would blame them for something and then fire them.",False
12,6,I was getting angry and angrier watching this...,Mehki_Girl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYet another billionaire, with wild ideas like they're a 13-year-old imagining the impossible while staring up at their ceiling in their bedroom, except, unlike that 13 year old, they have money to throw around.I'm so tired of watching people falling over billionaires, as though they're geniuses because they have a lot of money.This dude, had generational wealth. He was a mediocre engineering student at best and obviously he was an arrogant idiot.Warned time and time again that his submersible was going to fail and even his own experiments demonstrated how.Every time they attempted to submerge it to the depth that it needed to go to reach the Titanic, the submersible was popping like popcorn because the ocean and it's pressures doesn't care if you're a billiona.But his arrogance told him that he could will it to do his bidding, just like his money could will people to do his bidding.He's literally on camera admitting he'd lie, so what's a few thousand feet extra feet of tons of pressure? Haha, said the Princeton engineering graduate.Yeah, people really need to stop listening to billionaires, because they're grandiose and say things with conviction. All while the public isn't listening to the ridiculousness impracticality, the billions in costs, the possibly thousands of lives that would be lost but for one of their wild ideas.We're not going to colonize Mars and we're not going to colonize the ocean.Mother Earth alone is trying to kill us. Space and the ocean are the house and the odds are definitely in their favor.Anyway, I thought the documentary was really good; but like a lot of folks, I would have liked a little bit more information. I did not find the documentary ""biased"" in any way. The man was the owner and CEO of his own company. He didn't have a boss. He was the ultimate boss.Everyone basically said the same thing. If he didn't want to hear what you had to say about safety, you got yourself fired. He did everything he could to circumvent laws, not only of various countries - but the laws of physics.He also said, according to at least one employee, that he had no problems with ruining someone's life and he had the money to do it. And then in at least one case that I'm aware of he filed a law against a whistleblower, who didn't have the money to defend himself against a sociopathic billionaire. Not to mention according to another employee, he said, if he had to, he'd buy himself a congressman. Believe people when they tell you who they are.Unfortunately, other billionaires who probably believed their own BS believed his BS and put themselves and one child in danger.Too bad the ocean didn't do its job when he went down there by himself close to 4,000 ft down and was willing to lie about it if asked - he said so on camera.The man was an arrogant narcissist and, I'm going to say, a psychopath, who gave absolutely no regard to other people and actually invited them to pay him money to go to their deaths down in that submersible, knowing that it could not go 4,000 ft. He knew it beforehand - not just as a theory posited by the experienced experts that he fired - but from his own darn experiments.And there are people on here whining about he wasn't given a chance to defend himself.Defend himself against what? It failed. Innocent people died.The End.",True
13,5,Discovery+ has a better doc,Malauraashley,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have always been intrigued by the events surrounding OceanGate and the submersible, Titan. There haven't been many official videos regarding the events. After watching the Netflix documentary, I found myself with more questions than answers. Seeking further insight, I turned to the Discovery+ documentary after hearing about it. Between the two, the Discovery documentary proved to be far more informative and engaging than the one on Netflix. The Netflix version featured odd blurred backgrounds and missed essential witnesses and interviews. It unfortunately, genuinely fell short in several aspects.",False
14,7,"Tragedy in the era of denial and ""fake news""",Katz5,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a fascinating documentary about the lead up to the Titan submersible disaster in 2023. The focus is on OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, an aerospace engineer who graduated from college with a C- average (there are even shots of his college report cards) and eventually yearned to be the next Bezos or Musk.What is startling about this documentary is how it reflects the very 21st Century notions of science denial (any engineer, including those from Boeing, who disagreed with what Rush wanted to dangerously attempt was fired), declarations of ""fake news"" to facts he disagreed with, narcissism, and greed. This disaster could have easily been avoided if Rush just listened to the experts. That is, those who didn't graduate with C- averages.Some posters have painted him in a more sympathetic light - he was blinded by ambition. And he included himself in every test dive, including the fateful one that cost him and others their lives. Still, there is enough testimony from those who used to work for him in this documentary to paint him as basically a sociopath.Despite being nearly 2 hours long, the documentary seems a bit unfinished. Probably because the investigation of what ultimately happened to the submersible is still occurring. A sequel to this documentary is probably forthcoming once the investigation is complete.",False
15,7,Am interesting documentary.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stockton Rush had a unique vision: to develop a submersible and take passengers to the wreckage of the Titanic. Unfortunately, Ocean Gate subsequently failed and led to a tragic loss of life.The first time I heard news of this story, like many, was when it appeared on the news as being in trouble. This was a very sobering documentary; I'll applaud Netflix for the way the story was told. It was informative and systematic.One thing that became quickly apparent was how obnoxious and conceited Rush was. He seemingly didn't want to hear anything constructive from anybody, nothing that would get in the way of his vision, which was short-sighted and foolish.Fascinating interviews, I am glad it didn't dwell too heavily on the actual tragedy, and instead told of how the catastrophe happened and was allowed to happen.I just wish the Titanic would be allowed to rest in peace, it should not still be claiming lives so many years on.7/10.",False
16,6,"A disaster so predictable, even the ocean rolled its eyes",RubenKushalini,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched it twice, in fact-once for amusement, and the second time to confirm that yes, people really do slap together a tin can, call it innovation, and then expect the ocean to be impressed.This documentary struts in like it's revealing some groundbreaking tragedy, but let's be honest: this entire disaster was less ""unforeseen tragedy"" and more ""inevitable punchline."" The film tries to wear the somber tone of Chernobyl but ends up feeling like an extended episode of 1000 Ways to Die: Billionaire Edition.The documentary bends over backward to paint Stockton Rush as a misunderstood maverick, when in reality, he was more ""Silicon Valley cowboy"". There's a thin line between bravery and delusion, and this doc mostly fawns over the latter.Technically, it looks good. Slick video recordings of former employees, court hearings, sound acoustic data... all the usual tricks to make you feel like you're watching something profound. But beneath the sheen, it's just a slow-motion roast of a bad idea gone exactly how you'd expect: catastrophically.In the end, Titan isn't a cautionary tale. It's an ""I told you so"" wrapped in a Netflix budget. Arrogant? Maybe. But not nearly as arrogant as diving 12,500 feet in a tube held together by camping supplies and wishful thinking.",False
17,7,A tragedy from ego and ambition,gazwizz,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting insight of how one man's ego and ambition was the underlying cause of failure. Other reviewers have noted how this documentary doesn't focus on the actual event that day. But most of the world were following it in real time without knowing this insightful back story of why it happened. I recall the absurdity of the news coverage that day, with reporters talking about how much oxygen was left and how much time the passengers had before they could be rescued alive. But the sad reality was a catastrophic failure that had already happened. A failure that could have been prevented had it not been for the ego of one man, micro-managing a company in all the wrong ways with one disastrous goal in mind.",False
18,6,A let down,disguiseangelleo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Honestly when i came to know about the documentary, i was very excited.But sadly it did not fulfilled my expectation or maybe i expected too much.The end seem to me quite abrupt and it surely it felt quite incomplete.Also the documentary fails to create a strong emotional connection.There were pretty much negligible details (footage, recordings) regarding the people who died in the titan's last dive (i am very sorry and sad for those people).And maybe that is why it fails to create a strong connection.The series majorly focuses on the CEO of the Oceangate and how he created the submersible.",False
19,8,Reflection of one man hubris,LilyWai,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary answered a lot of questions that we the public were left with following the disastrous implosion of the Titan that took the lives of five people, including the CEO Stockton Rush.Interviews with the staff who worked at Oceangate with Rush showed just how arrogant the man was & just how much team members were forced to keep concerns to themselves for fear of facing the backlash from their boss.Hearing the meeting recording where an important & experienced team member was going through his extensive review & analysis of the submersible & where he saw the flaws & issues made it clear that the company was not governed by a safety first ethos or any similarly prudent principle but rather by what could be said was ""when Stockton speaks that is the last word...even if it's wrong"".It seems illogical to me that all these highly experienced & skilled professionals - much more skilled than their CEO in many respects - didn't speak up & only fed this man's ego driven determination to make it to the depth of the Titanic at any cost. As the world now knows the cost of five lives was a cost too high but the real tragedy was the significant flaws in design, materials & the need for independent checks - all issues that were identified at many stages along the development timeline & were either not voiced due to fear of the CEO or silenced by termination of employment by the CEO - could have, if acknowledged & implemented, likely have prevented this awful loss of life.",True
20,7,Well Done,ricktickner,n/a,16/08/2025,"Titan Submersible: A Cautionary Tale in Hubris and HardwareGreat doc - eerie interviews mixed with live footage, giving real ""This should've been a warning sign"" energy.But let's talk Stockton Rush. If he's a genius, then I'm an astrophysicist with a side hustle in common sense. After the first carbon fiber failure at shallow depth, most people would rethink life choices. He doubled down with, ""Regulations are just suggestions,"" and built a deep-sea death trap with gamer controller vibes.If nothing else, Titan proved that money can't buy sense, but it can buy you a front-row seat to the ocean's crushing reality.",False
21,9,Destiny of Modern Era Tech Start-ups,NKomat,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an aerospace graduate and experienced composite material engineer, I cannot relate more to this story and moral dilemmas that team had regarding authoritarian and vain character of Stockton Rush.Movie brilliantly picks up single most important thing that went wrong and reveals problem with many modern start-ups who are trying to prove that some high tech projects can be done successfully for a fraction of money invested in H&S and quality control.I have seen some other reviews that criticize the film for not talking more about the last dive and background stories of the deceased passengers, but they are entirely missing the point of the movie. The error was systematic; it had nothing to do with last dive preparatory work or operations. Some other people commented that the movie doesn't cover Stockton's side of the story, but it does. Through transcripts, emails and live recordings.Could not recommend this movie enough.",False
22,7,Such a b*stard,danielcereto,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching this documentary I just discovered the truth behind the Titan's accident. And the truth is raw and cruel.First, extremely rich people have a super ego. Period. They think they are over life and obviously death. And they're not. They're just humans like anybody else.Second, the documentary is great and and most of my questions were answered. But not all of them. I think it could have showed more about the day of the accident and less from the years before.Anyway, nothing is perfect and I recommend this documentary to people who wants to meet the man. The only one, who was the responsible of that tragedy.",False
23,5,Was going along swimmingly..,TomatoesareRotten,n/a,16/08/2025,"( No pun intended ) and as the documentary was reaching its well documented denouement , then the wrap seemed very very rushed ? The original Lead Engineer was scathing in his criticism of Stockton ; "" borderline , clinical psychopath "" was probably spot on . "" My way or the highway "" is never a good philosophy when team participation is a critical factor . Critical was the watchword throughout this lengthy and costly venture , but the majority of it was ( literally ) ignored . Lochridge was a commendable individual , with devout beliefs in his capabilities and expertise, but again ignored and I'll venture he thanks god every day , that those principles were borne out . The only cringeworthy character in the whole documentary, was the "" influencer "" Koehler , who - unsurprisingly - made it all about him ! I truly wish they'd edit him out.",False
24,6,A tragedy told from arrogance and negligence.,LeonardoOliva69,n/a,16/08/2025,"A highly anticipated documentary about the Oceangate tragedy/negligence and its submarine, the Titan, which ended the lives of four innocent people and an arrogant narcissist who thought he knew more than the experts who had warned him about the dangers.It was a highly publicized event in 2023 and, as I recall, quite morbid, with that timer and countdown that warned of how much air the submarine had left... truly aberrant.What did I get with this documentary? I was really expecting a little more. It's basically a pamphlet that portrays Stockton Rush as what he was: a psychopath/narcissist. The events leading up to it are shown, along with everything that happened that warned of the impending disaster. But I feel like it's a lot of exposure and blame on Rush and zero appreciation for the other parties. A person who can't defend himself is exposed, subjected to public ridicule, and we don't even have the opinion of his family, who I assume have refused to do this.What happens then is a polarization of the information, leaving a ""good"" side, who apparently warned at all times, and a ""bad"" side, which is the company with Rush at the helm.It doesn't reveal anything new that hadn't been previously reported, there's no further details, and, above all, we're not told about the victims except for PH Nargeolet, since his daughter appears for a few moments.Beyond all its flaws, it's a material that brings to the fore a very important issue: the lack of control some companies have. This gives them the freedom to do things that violate moral standards in order to generate more and more money. Tragedies like this exist and will continue to exist; the question is what can we do to prevent them?",False
25,7,A Tragic Tale Sunk by Rush-ed Storytelling,QAlpha007,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary had me hooked from the start - the topic is heavy, emotional, and very real. It's shocking to see how one man's overconfidence (looking at you, Stockton Rush) could lead to such a horrible disaster. The film does a good job showing the red flags people raised and how safety was ignored just to chase some billionaire dreams.Production-wise, Netflix did what they do best - clean editing, good interviews, and a serious tone. Some of the behind-the-scenes stories were heartbreaking and eye-opening.But here's the thing... I was expecting more about the actual day the sub went missing. The final moments, the rescue timeline, what really happened hour-by-hour - they barely spent a few minutes on that part. It felt rushed, no pun intended. 😬Also, while the documentary points fingers (fairly) at Rush and his decisions, I wish it showed more expert analysis or simulations about what might have gone wrong inside the sub.In the end, this docu is a good warning about ignoring science and playing with nature, but it could've gone deeper (just like the sub tried to). Still worth watching, but feels incomplete.",False

1,6,"A couple interesting things but chances are, you're already familiar with most of these.",Odin_Blaine,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't know about The Wilhem Scream's origins so that was neat. Rob Lowe is likable enough as the host but there's just enough here to justify its own existence. Why not go more into depth? Who doesn't already know about most of these cliches? The jump scare, the magical Negro (how could they not mention that genius Key and Peele sketch?), the White savior etc. Montages??? I would've loved to hear about cliche quotes such as ""It's quiet...too quiet"" etc. Origins of where the quotes came from etc. Maybe this would've worked better as a series that went more in depth and talked about cliches you might not know are cliches but as it is, it's just fine. Worse ways to spend an hour.",False
2,5,"Good for movie clichés, not the woke clichés",prhayhurst,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHalf of this was enjoyable, and half wasn't.Rob Lowe was a good presenter, very tongue in cheek with every category, and has charisma in spades.The movie clichés were fun, the woke ""clichés"", and those brought in to talk about them were not.You could see those who were there to talk about clichés in general, and those who were there just to say their piece about certain ""clichés"" and get their viewpoint across, as you could feel their heart rate rise and their excitement grow!Netflix cannot make anything without an agenda, not a movie, show, or, as it seems, a light and entertaining documentary!!It's worth a watch if you have a spare hour, if you're like me though, expect a lot of eye rolling in certain places.",True
3,5,"Interesting, but with leftist bent",bmarsh-352-908525,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kinda like a live action version of TV Tropes. However tends to lean heavily into a very ""woke"" commentary. From denigrating everyone involved in the Hays Code to criticizing white people as being automatically bad.",False
4,6,It's nothing groundbreaking that hasn't been covered before but it fills the time.,Cinemaniac1984,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hosted by Rob Lowe, the Netflix documentary Attack of the Hollywood Clichés takes us through the history of the most common clichés used throughout movie history.As a lifelong film fan, I'm familiar with several of the clichés covered in the documentary. Sure there's a few that I agreed with, but there were parts that left me wondering, ""Why would you cover that?"" but I guess it's relevant. No need to get all woke on segments such as racism, gender and sexuality. That stuff is outdated anyway and it doesn't fit in with modern day audiences.It's nothing groundbreaking that hasn't been covered before, but Attack of the Hollywood Clichés certainly fills the time.6/10.",False
5,6,For the Whiners...,Mehki_Girl,n/a,16/08/2025,"...That love whining about how unoriginal Hollywood, they can whine about this. It's short and I enjoyed it. It's definitely tongue in cheek.",False
6,6,I wish the attack was more precise,a-sin_13,n/a,16/08/2025,"This Netflix special has a great sense of purpose, but it's not as focused as it could be if it was. It's a bit like a Spit -Take or Montage mode, and it's full of all the crazy facts that come from a fake scare called the Luton Bus, as well as the story of Willem's screams. It's not as thoughtful as it could be, but since it's only an hour, you can probably still watch it on your free weekends and pass it along to your cinema-loving friends. The problem is that it's not as funny as it should be, and it's not as irreverent as it could be. It's got the same lazy familiarity of the Hollywood movies it's trying to mock.~ P. X.",False
7,7,This was full of cliches,Top_Dawg_Critic,n/a,16/08/2025,"But that was the point, right? Aside from pointing out obvious cliches in films, it was interesting to learn the labels such as ""meet cute"" to the ""maverick cop"" to the ""talking to tombstones"" etc of the popular chiches, but it was even more interesting which films pioneered each cliche. Rob Lowe did a fine job and was certainly entertaining hosting and narrating this special, as were the other guests. At just under an hour runtime, the pacing was spot on and the story flew by quickly. Sure there was nothing revolutionary in this special, but I still enjoyed it, as it was fun to learn which films paved the way and set the trends for the individual cliches.",False
8,2,Not for true film fans,mls4182,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is very simplistic. Not for hardcore fans of film. It really doesn't make any points most of us don't already know. The people complaining that movies are responsible for social problems is foolish. Using the past as an excuse for the present is pathetic. I'm so ashamed of people who use ""boomer"" as an insult. We learn from those with a winder frame of reference.I guess I am a snob, plain and simple.I basically watched this to see Rob Lowe's real face without filters and digital airbrushing in his Atkins commercials.",False
9,7,Good but could be more long,AvionPrince16,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this Attack of the Hollywood cliches. It have some great information about origins of some clichés that you can still see in the modern movies. It talked a lot of stuff about race, sex, nudity, horror genre, jumpscare, women in movies, action movies, sound. Pretty great overview of some clichés. But i will love to see a way long show that present most of them. It was really too short and i wanted more but still entertaining and informative.",False
10,3,"Uninspired, unfunny, unnecessarily woke",ttiimm2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Switched it off before it ended. An unnecessary, uninspired and unfunny list of clichés that despite some (semi-)stars showing up is not better than random lists one can find on Youtube, trying to get your views with the lowest investment.As clichéd as the tropes it wants to highlight, sprinkled with obvious woke remarks that frustrate rather than inspire or give insight.",False
11,8,"Lighten up, people. The producers did. You can, too.",lotekguy-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"What's not to like about this bit of whimsical fluff? Rob Lowe - arguably the ultimate troubled Hollywood star cliche not named Charlie Sheen- narrates the industry's mea culpa for excessive reliance on many of its go-to gimmicks. As a very minor film critic, I also appreciate that many of the talking heads are relatively unknown reviewers. That's showing some love for the folks in the unlit, popcorn-scented trenches who variably savor or endure endless iterations of the depicted tropes so their audiences can make informed choices.My nit to pick is that other examples came to mind along the way that I would have preferred. No better depiction of the avenging-daddy's-murder theme exists than ""My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" It shouldda been a contendah.",False
12,7,"It's good, just a little bit rushed.",jopecordeiro,n/a,16/08/2025,"A lot of crying boomers around here that can't accept Hollywood assuming some of it's own mistakes (I don't know what is so bad about that). And even so, the most part of the film wasn't about that , so no need to be traumatized by the said ""woke stuff"" there. Get over it and maybe try to evolve along society?",False
13,3,Woke,wolfrahms,n/a,16/08/2025,"The White Savior trope was discussed as a trope where a white person acts as a savior to black people. This is simply shameless and offensive appropriation, as that trope is strongly associated with native americans and other real or fictional cultures in movies such as Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai, Dune, Pocahontas and Avatar.They ignore all the premiere examples to focus on a movie like The Green Book, where the trope is so weak that it might not even be worth discussing, but they just had to make it all about black people, of course. Cringe and tone deaf.Bland and uninspired show, that doesn't even discuss the BWAAARP sound Nolan uses in every trailer.",False
14,n/a,What scary about a cat jump scare?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,I learned some things. Mainly that the film critics are scared of cats... so yeah.,False
15,7,It works,TheOneThatYouWanted,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nothing ground breaking but fun to watch considering it is only an hour long. Plus Rob Lowe is spot on when it comes to hosting anything. Lowe can sell Florida to a sane person. Still, this documentary doesn't cover everything... it was made by Hollywood after all.",False
16,7,Missed one!,yannickradecker,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was hoping you were gonna mention the one that i keep hearing constantly, which is the most repetitive line thats heard over and over: ""You/I/We got this!""
Every movie and every episode.. Am I the only one who's noticed this because I tried too find if anyone else had picked up on this but unfortunately to no avail..",False
17,6,A Super fun Rider of Movie Clips,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you like movies and enjoy the historical development of films this is a super-fun, fast paced, and compact engagement of your time. Rob Lowe does a fun job hosting and guiding us on a tour of Hollywood Cliches through film clips and guest commentators. The fun is how many movie scenes they manage to pack into this 1 hour show. It is really fun, in my opinion, but I am a movie nut. One of the best parts of the show is that it, too, does not take itself too seriously. It's about Hollywood Cliches, and Rob Lowe gets that as he guides us through this one. Netflix has too many shows with too many installments, but for this one I do hope for more in the series.",False
18,6,Interesting,blahblahblah91,n/a,16/08/2025,"But wow are there a LOT of ""f your feelings"" people butt hurt! Obviously we know the cliches, but to write your negative opinion about this doc showing the annoying side of black actors/actresses being either a savior or needing to be saved is racist af. Maybe put yourself in their shoes. Oh but you'd have to have empathy for other human beings.Anyway. The only movies I was confused why they were added for the lgbtq trope was Philadelphia and Milk. Those movies were based on a true story where the gay man did die. Other than that, I found it entertaining. But that's cuz I'm not a ""f your feelings"" kinda person :D.",False
19,4,Waste of time,tannguyen-62510,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are actually Youtube channels that do better video essays than this hour-long and poorly-patched together Mojo list. The analysis of cliches are rushed and selections of movies are erratic, like a high school essay written from a Google searched of the book summary. Clips and highlights served as a ""I told you so"" rather than movie analysis.In important ""attacks"" related to race, gender, (and the police?), the example scenes are so obviously cherry picked for talking points that fit the current political climate. In this process, they completely ignore how the particular scene fit in the theme of the whole movie and in the dynamics between the characters. Not to mention the vast assumptions they constantly make on how some random film was perceived, as well as the horrible (or great) audience that would celebrate these cliché to try and inject their own politics.",False
20,6,"Not bad, but could have been a series",elizabethbaird-98760,n/a,16/08/2025,"This wasn't bad, informative in a way. Interesting, but could have, should have been a series, as they could have gone into several of these more, expanded, as well as included more that many of us know exist.But, I need to comment about the ""spit take doesn't happen"". It absolutely does. It isn't as often, but it happens.Additionally, I would have liked them to point out a cliche that comes up with pregnant women, who will go into labor via water breaking (less than 11percent of women start labor this way), and this normally happens at an inconvenient time and has more often gotten a comment by a man of ""well we'll get another"", or something like this.",False
21,2,Woke trash,mweaver-10401,n/a,16/08/2025,"I see what it was trying to do but it failed. Some of the clips show depth but most skim the surface and never explain the cliche. Also, to add a whole part about apples and not include one clip of the king of eating in movies, Brad Pitt, was just wrong. I finally turned it off when one of the comments was about how some white guy in Ohio was enjoying Bagger Vance, suggesting nobody else would like that movie. Netflix take your woke, make people feel bad about themselves BS out of here. It's not only offensive because of comments like that but offensive to film history that you only give us the bare minimum of any of these cliches. This is just trash on so many levels.",False
22,10,People are born complainers,carsonmoore-09282,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was EXACTLY what it promised to be, and that's how things should be rated. It's meant to be light hearted- an overview rather than a masterclass. Rob's script is perfect for the vibe they were attempting for. A great look at a lot of Hollywood cliches, certainly not all and a bit of a performance piece rather than a documentary- but perfectly enjoyable. Anyone who says this isn't for movie fans is a snob plain and simple.",False
23,6,Could have been more,Kingslaay,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was underwhelmed by this documentary. I was hoping for a witty, funny and succinct episode. Despite the star power it fails to fully engage. I feel I could have easily uncovered these nuggets online or by watching youtube. It was nice seeing some big names and original footage of great scenes. I was hoping for more surprises and crazy facts.",False
24,1,Shallow,dierregi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Might have been interesting, but it turned out as a very unbalanced attempt to cram a billion cliches (most familiar to discerning moviegoers) plus a few woke reminders. Netflix just cannot entertain its audience, it must preach, patronise and hammer its point of view in every single ""original"" show.There might be a cliche about the ""white saviour"" but for sure Netflix (and Prime and just about any single movie and TV show produces in States in the last five years) managed to reverse that, with their own ""black saviour"" cliche... and Rob Lowe is a most annoying, not funny and smug host.",False
25,n/a,Actually good,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought it would be bad seeing all the anti woke reviews, but it's surprisingly solid... don't listen to these whiny hogs losers.",False

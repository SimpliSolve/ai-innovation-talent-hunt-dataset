1,8,slow but essential to watch,GiuliaF-34,n/a,15/08/2025,"Another very good and timeless documentary by Petra. A bit slower than The Edge of Democracy, but worth watching to understand the parallel between religion and politics in Brazil. This is a parallel that can be drawn in other countries, but it's more evident today in Brazil with evangelical churches. For those who say it's biased, it also shows the Brazilian left's dilemma with religion, which is very complex and often contradictory. It could be faster, more dynamic. Less Malafaia and more about the role of these churches on both sides, despite being more evident in the Brazilian far right. I liked it, and watched this to my Polish wife, it was very interesting but could be deeper than what was showcased.",False
2,8,Chilling examination on Brazil's rapid transformation on the far right,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""Apocalypse In the Tropics"" (2024 release; 119 min) opens, the movie's director, Petra Costa, herself Brazilian, recounts in a voiceover how surprised she was upon returning there in 2016 to fins that Brazil's political landscape was rapidly transforming as a result of the record growth of evangelicals (from 5% to 30% in the last 40 years). Costa decides to look into this phenom and was granted wide access. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: Oscar-nominated documentarian Petra Costa (""The Edge of Democracy"") brings another highly-charged political documentary. This time reflecting on how evangelicals have overtaken the hard right, resulting in the astonishing election of Bolsonaro in 2018, and all the things that came after that. If is a fascinating watch. I was vaguely familiar with much of this, but to see it laid out as precise and clear as Costa does here, it all pits it into a new perspective. Also this: Bolsonaro copies pretty much every move by Trump, with a two year delay. Absolutely amazing. Please note that Brad Pitt is one of the movie's Executive Producers.""Apocalypse in the Tropics"" premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August, 2024, to immediate and universal critical acclaim. It is now streaming on Netflix, where I caught it just the other night. The documentary is currently rated 92% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason. If you are interested in geopolitics, or in the ever-growing influence of evangelicals, in this case in Brazil, over the political scene, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
3,8,A chilling documentary about Christian Nationalism in Brazil that is a code red for democracy...,mdw0526,n/a,15/08/2025,"The new Netflix documentary ""Apocalypse in the Tropics"" is a chilling, close-up look at Christian Nationalism on the rise, this time in Brazil, which is reckoning with its own version of January 6. With an eerie score, pointed narration, and unnervingly intimate footage, the doc takes you into the backrooms where power, faith, and fascism collide. What's most striking is that unlike the U. S., Brazil seems willing to hold its would-be coup plotters to account. As an American who lived through a real military coup in Thailand, I found this film deeply unsettling and terribly relevant. Watching from abroad, it's impossible not to see the parallels: attacks on democratic institutions, judicial overreach, corporate complicity, and a twisted gospel that weaponizes religion to control women, demonize LGBTQ+ people, and ignore the poor, the sick, and the stranger. This isn't just a Brazilian problem; it's a global one and it may already be too late. This doc is highly recommended and honestly, it's Code Red for democracy everywhere.",False
4,10,A very necessary reminder and warning,epistemologia-latimes,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a very difficult but very necessary movie, which shows us upfront the destructive foolishness of allowing Christianity to dictate politics, and of enabling dangerous authoritarians to represent people.Brazil has been - and still is - saddled with multitudes of delinquents with Christian discourse. There is no upside to that obscenity, and we all must strive to get rid of that disease.The movie is a bit tedious, for sure. So much of what it shows we have painfully watched happens with our own eyes. But perhaps not enough people have the integrity to remember what has happened and how fiercely it must be stopped and corrected.",False
5,10,delicate and didactic,imdbfan-251065,n/a,15/08/2025,"From beginning to end, I felt something I hadn't felt in a long time. This documentary brought back memories of the terror Brazil experienced for four years under the previous administration and how we cannot allow that to happen again. It's easy to understand and the narrative is very easy to understand. Petra did a job that many will say is fabricated, but it's the naked truth that needs to be shown to the world, but mainly to show how capable Brazil is of evolving and achieving justice, and that no other country should blackmail an entire nation. Assista e aproveite a história sendo contada.",False
6,10,From the 48th São Paulo Film Festival,Victor_daSilva_,n/a,15/08/2025,"First of my twenty films at the 48th São Paulo Film Festival, Apocalypse in the Tropics delivers more than its predecessor, The Edge of Democracy, in addition to consecrating (to keep with the theme) Petra Costa's pair of historical documentaries as masterpieces of Brazilian audiovisual.In The Edge of Democracy, Petra's life is parallel to democracy in Brazil, and this makes her a co-protagonist of this national story, that goes from Juscelino to Bolsonaro. Here, in Apocalypse, the documentarist initially admits that she is not an expert on Paul or John of Patmos, and she wisely lets the story be told through the eyes of other figures. Some popular figures here and there get lost in a narrative that would gain more strength from their point of view, as the real highlight is the fearsome pastor Silas Malafaia. Using political terms to comment on your church, and religious terms to comment on democracy, Malafaia walks and rules at Alvorada, to the point of repeating Bolsonaro's speech, so that the president would not forget what he had to say, what Malafaia ordered him to say.Four years of inadmistration are summarized, so that the projection does not become ""look, gringo, how we suffered"", but rather ""look, Brasil, what you went through to get here"", and by ""here"" I mean the real apocalypse.I loved starting the Festival with this film, I would have liked to have enjoyed it more without the pressure of not catching the train to get home (obrigado, meu amor, por ter me ajudado, sem você isso não teria sido possível). Petra Costa, do more! Brazil will never tire of producing material for your filming (only criticism: Cabo Daciolo was missing, who made a cameo at the beginning of the film, back in 2016, and didn't even say ""glória a deux!"").",False
7,10,"A Shocking Dive into Evangelicals, Bolsonaro, and Brazil's Political Chaos",thuliobenvenuti,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an incredible film by Petra Costa! I have to admit, it took me by surprise. I'd read somewhere that it was about the January 8th riots. Nothing could be further from the truth. The events of January 8th only appear in the final 10 minutes of this nearly two-hour film. Instead, it's a deep dive into the role of evangelical Christians in Brazilian politics-specifically, their influence in Jair Bolsonaro's election and their later involvement in radicalization and the attempted coup.I was expecting something dry and tedious, but what I found was a humble and insightful narrative.This film far surpasses *The Edge of Democracy*.Timely and absolutely essential.",False
8,10,The right wing couldn't bear facing reality,nunesvladimirbio,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a documentary that explores deep religious-political issues, it's no wonder that there will be (and there are already) lots of negative comments about it. However, Brazil (like many other countries) has been split open in two halves of the political spectrum for quite some time now. But what we see in this film (and in Petra's previous one) is that, in Brazilian history, it was always the right wing that resourced to violence to force their ideals. When open violence was no longer an attractive tool, they turned to religion, offering easy, messianic tools to promise solutions to a struggling people often failed by democratic institutions. The poorly educated masses of Brazil are easy prey to evangelical-politician hawks who, deep within, care a lot about their pockets but nothing at all about their flock.Brazil was never meant to be a country built for itself and its people, and we can see the results now.",False
9,10,It's more than a movie.,salespeixotovinicios,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the stark reality shown to the world. The photography is fascinating beyond its narrative, congratulations!You can see Petra Costa's dedication to her research in the documentary, even though she brings her vision among the facts shown, she still shows partiality in many cases.I hope that in this way, with this film by Petra Costa, we Brazilians can learn to be open-minded and that from now on we can open our eyes. Conservatism destroys, we know very well what happened to Germany and its conservatism in 1939.This document deserves to be seen, not only as a film, but as an account of a nation in trouble!",False
10,3,Mild Discomfort in Monotone,dierregi,n/a,15/08/2025,"A subject burning with political fire - Brazil's Evangelical surge, Bolsonaro as puppet, Lula's resurrection, and the violent echo of January 6th in Brasilia - somehow turned into a shapeless, lifeless dirge.The documentary stumbles through events with all the narrative clarity of a scrambled jigsaw. The director-narrator, whose voice could sedate cattle, drifts from the rise of Evangelicals to Lula's imprisonment, then lurches back to Bolsonaro's holy handlers without ever building tension or context.We're treated to endless shots of Brasilia's sterile geometry and a random detour into Billy Graham, because apparently we hadn't veered off course enough.If you don't know Brazil, you'll be confused. If you do, you'll be annoyed. Either way, you'll wish someone else had made this, or at least spoken up a bit.Seriously, the narrative sounded like a PowerPoint presentation read by someone on three Xanax.",False
11,10,"Every Brazilian citizen should watch it, regardless of their political stance",dancastro27,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Apocalypse in the Tropics"" is a powerful and timely documentary that bravely explores the alarming rise of religious fundamentalism within the political sphere - a phenomenon with deep and troubling implications for democracies around the world, especially in countries like Brazil. With her signature sensitivity and courage, Petra Costa delivers a work that is both urgent and poetic, peeling back layers of ideology to reveal how faith, when co-opted by power, can erode institutions and threaten civil liberties. This film is not just a warning - it's a vital act of resistance. Petra once again proves why she is one of the most essential voices in contemporary documentary cinema.",False
12,10,Masterpiece,TatianaP-51,n/a,15/08/2025,"Petra Costa revisits political themes in her new documentary, Apocalypse in the Tropics. This time, the director and screenwriter sheds light on the historical rise of evangelical leaders in Brazilian politics and their impact on the Rule of Law.Divided into five chapters, carefully inspired by the Bible, the film is a bold, urgent, and at times unsettling portrait of a pendulum nation-one that signals theocracy and flirts with dictatorship, yet boasts one of the most progressive constitutions in the world. An emblematic moment (and perhaps the insight that sparked the production of the film) occurs when the filmmaker is gifted a Bible by a democratically elected congressman inside the Chamber of Deputies.Once again, Petra exposes her traumas (as she did in Elena and The Edge of Democracy) in a visceral yet beautiful, masterful, and deeply sensitive way.",False
13,10,"Terrifying , impressive!",VanessaM-955,n/a,15/08/2025,"Do you like horror movies?This is real, it's scaring, it's impressive. It took me some days to digest how we must always be alert in Brazil and in the world, cause it's not the first time the far right and the religious get together. Brazil is laic!! All democracies , all countries must be!Once more, a MUST see documentary from this Director, after Democracia em Vertigem.Brava, Petra Costa!",False
14,3,Isn't anything neutral anymore ?,janyD,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't know anything about Brazilian politics, so as a complete novice to the topic I was hoping to learn some interesting facts especially about the religious shift, but unfortunately we all know bias when we see it and it was distracting. The documentary omits key information, for example, evangelism grew from 5% to 30% why the sudden shift to religion ? Did people lose hope in secularism and their progressive policies? The filmmaker is derisive of preachers who go into towns with ""no hospitals and no paved roads"" offering a sense of belonging...but if socialism was working why was the economic situation so bad and why was no one else helping them?....no explanation as to how this shift developed told me the filmmakers were being very selective in ""documenting""....plus the narrator's voice was extremely annoying !",True
15,1,More Netflix slop for the Reddit masses,imdbfan-571123,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just your usual Netflix slop, expect the obvious religion = bad narrative. It's almost comical at times how seriously the documentary takes itself, although that is not unusual in this genre. Sound-bites , out of context clips and dramatic music are all used to forward the directors own narrative while showcasing little of the oppositions side. I am sure however that Reddit was soy-facing and pog-champing the whole time they watched it, because ultimately that is who Netflix documentaries are made for, American masses who know very little about the subject matter being shown to them. Watch for comical value.",False
16,3,Like watching paint dry,philipmounts,n/a,15/08/2025,"Tedious and boring to the point that youll lose interest in their only goal to tie religion and politics together. Wow, what a revelation. Pun intended. This is like some bad documentary I was forced to watch in college back in the day with zero payoff because it's no mystery what their attempting to sell within five minutes. Another non mystery is that this is taking place in country that has never hid its religious identity, Brazil. It goes to great lengths to point out what most people, including those that reside outside of South America, should already know, if they have paid attention to world politics. This documentary could have easily been cut in half. You've been warned.",False
17,2,"Clearly a leftist propaganda, unfortunately",raffa10,n/a,15/08/2025,"Also you can see in the neutral (or at least not left-skewed) reviews how the downvotes are massive. I know how things involving media and population mindset control work in Brazil - but also in most countries. It's an army.People that are upvoting this movie are clearly either from the ""left army"" or friends & family from the producers/director/actor. Sad.If you're not Brazilian (and even if you are!) and really want to learn about politics in Brazil, I urge you to watch Beyond Citizen Kane.It's from the beginning of the 1990s, made by BBC, and shows - with FACTS, interviews and common STATISTICS how the Brazilian people is controlled by media.Nothing to do with religion.",False
18,1,The democracy that only PT wants,davidsonabreu-60112,n/a,15/08/2025,"Once again, the dear who has voted for Lula since 1990 wants to talk about democracy, when the PT party was the one that destroyed Brazil the most. Dilma was removed from office for stealing, Lula was arrested for stealing, but there are still those who say they defend democracy. Lula and Bolsonaro are both ridiculous figures who no longer deserve to be president. In 2026 we will choose a new name, Romeu Zema. He will lead Brazil to prosperity and away from extremes and corruption. Enough with socialism, the country needs a real liberal in charge. Change Brazil, change for real. PT NUNCA MAIS !!!",False
19,1,"Another Fail, not worth your time",hbt-vieira,n/a,15/08/2025,"In another very poor and biased made story, the maker try to bend reality and truth with narratives that were part of soviet union way of implement stories in the fabric of society, tho this kind of strategy used to work perfectly decades ago, nowdays the decentralized and distributed broadcast of information easy and rapidly torns down such narratives and imprecisions of the soviet misinformation tactics the Petra tried to used once again in this ""documentary"" that looks more like a romance. Now regarding the quality of the content, production and quality of edition it is visible that she improved a lot when we compare to ""Democracia em Vertigem"" which was even worst in the story line, but production, editing and general content was a total desaster compared to this new one.",False
20,1,A fiction made by a far left extremist,suikoden-16663,n/a,15/08/2025,"This same Petra photoshoped a gun out from a scene from her last scyfi fiction movie she called decumentary. This one is another fiction story created by her paid with brazil people moneys. Here ""Yes, it's true that Petra Costa, director of the documentary ""Democracy in Vertigo,"" admitted to using Photoshop to edit an image. She removed weapons from the scene of the Lapa militants' deaths, which was shown in the film, claiming that the police had planted the weapons at the scene to justify the murders.""",False

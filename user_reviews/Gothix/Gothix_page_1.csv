1,10,Brilliant and inspiring,xrlofficial,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a gripping documentary illustrating how dehumanizing, merciless and irrational cancel culture can be. I found it gripping - it's very well paced with a lot of fun personality in the editing and Gothix herself is always very engaging to watch.This offered a fascinating insight into her life and career, the emotional highs and lows of her journey and ultimately a triumph over adversity.One aspect I found interesting as well is while the documentary does naturally highlight the hypocrisy of the political views of those instigating the canceling, I felt it stayed mostly focused on the human story of Gothix's experiences more so than leaning in super hard on politics which will make it even more accessible for some. Recommended!",False
2,10,Immediately compelling,amazingmrswilson,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was immediately drawn into this documentary by the voice of Vanessa in the opening audio. She wails, completely brokenhearted, ""You ... took away the only thing I've ever loved doing!"" The Gothix documentary exposes the hypocrisy of the left as it takes you through the rising popularity of this talented, intellectual and rational black woman, to her crushing cancellation by that same community who supported her - as long as she didn't diverge from 'acceptable' opinions. Though Vanessa finds the strength and courage to stand up and remake herself after going into the depths of depression, her ultimate redemption comes when she recognizes that, she, too, has been hypocritical, and that there is a greater demand on her for, and by the ultimate love.",False
3,9,Cool story arc,taraoar,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's tough not to love the charismatic star of this documentary: the indomitable, adorable, insightful Gothix! As someone who is not a gamer/streamer/denizen of the metaverse I wondered if I would relate to this story, but the filmmaker did a great job of creating a well-done film with an impactful story arc. Finding that her online community has turned on her, Gothix begins to ask questions which lead her down a painful but ultimately enlightening path. It's an accessible story with far-reaching implications, artfully told by a filmmaker with a broad scope. He manages to balance the poignant with the playful as Gothix faces her haters and speaks the truth with love.",True
4,10,Expertly done,caitie-07423,n/a,16/08/2025,For a relatively new filmmaker with a small production company this doc felt so smooth and expertly done. The story is an inspiring one and the filmmaker did a stellar job telling it without the use of many tropes that take you out of it. By the end I really felt like I knew Vanessa and Saul. The film highlighted the perils of online fame and they cult of progressivism even diving into the ways that the victims of the cancel mob participated in it themselves. You could tell that the film evolved as it was being made and in spite of that it came together with a cohesion that I can imagine was hard to pull off ( not that it looked like a struggle when watching it). Well done to Small Media Large and Graeme Wilson.,False
5,9,A Great Tale of Victory over Victimhood!,lgilmer-76648,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember following Gothix RIGHT BEFORE the ""Little Mermaid Madness"". This documentary is an amazing walk through memory lane and also a reminder of how ruthless some people can be and how some people don't want conversation, but compliance.As Someone who was dealing with some of this myself, I felt every bit of this. Fortunately, this story has a good ending!Overall, this is a GREAT watch! Great editing and directing from Graeme Wilson to help enhance and streamline this storytelling experience! The bits from Starsan, Saul and Eric July are a great touch that adds another outside perspective to this deep tale.Just also wanted to say to Gothix and Saul that I'm happy to have had a chance to meet and talk with you both! Glad to see you used a situation meant to tear you down into something positive! Keep up the good work!Lawrence ""L. G."" Gilmer - 210LG

6,10,Fantastic Documentary!,andrewlawniczak,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before watching this documentary, I had no idea who Gothix was. I don't follow that genre, but watching this was fascinating. I was captivated the whole way through and I really loved the way it showed her evolution through her political and spiritual journey. It exposes the behind-the-scenes horror of today's ""cancel culture"" and how it can ruin someone's life - for almost no reason at all.I was especially moved at the surprise ending of it all. I did not expect any of that to happen but was watching with tears in my eyes as it happened. I have followed Gothix on YouTube now and look forward to her content. I also am looking forward to other documentaries by the filmmaker.",False
7,10,Thought provoking,jwiley-95569,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautifully documentation of the realities of being an internet identity. There is a major problem with some people's quick judgements and high emotions online.How some peoples perceived misunderstandings can send you on a whirlwind of floods of negative comments and destroying lives. This is especially true on the internet.This is just ONE example. Gothix rose, fell, and rose AGAIN to do something she loved. She is a genuine human being who cares about those around her. I loved the documentary. If you know someone who has delt with anything listed above give this documentary a shot. Even if you haven't it's definitely a series of stories that will get you thinking.",False
8,10,A compelling look at the absurdity of cancel culture,michelle-22682,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn incredibly important and insightful documentary showing the backlash of cancel culture.I was very intrigued by Gothix's story, it sucked me in! Vanessa (Gothix) was a beloved Twitch streamer who was excommunicated for freely speaking on a topic she didn't realize was controversial. She was cancelled, and forced to rebuild her brand, her business and herself, coming back stronger than before! This is a story of redemption, and Gothix's comeback fills me with hope. I've truly enjoyed following her on social media, and I'm grateful that what seemed like an unfortunate event at the time, actually lead her to Christ. I'll be sharing this documentary with friends and family. Great job to the cast and director! 10/10.",True
9,9,Not only about cancel culture,simeonlandis,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAll the 2020's political craziness explored and documented in this film is simply the scaffolding supporting its central - timeless - human story: the search for a God.This film captures that timelessness so well: showing how an industrious woman deals with the highs and lows of her time in history, searches for happiness, and finally makes a decision that will not only get her ""canceled"" and banned from the institutions of right now, but pits her against all that is wrong in the world.There is no feel good, sentimental solution to her problems. The film ends with a kind of cold blooded clarity, and the uncertainty captured is one we all share, packing more punch than any contrived drama.",True
10,9,Inspiring and Well Made,abigailjstraka,n/a,16/08/2025,"I honestly forgot watching that this was done by such a small production team. You get to know Vanessa (Gothix) and see her grow, as well as Saul, over 3 years. The evolution of her character and soul is a beautiful thing to see, not backing down in the face of opposition. My only critique would be that the sound mixing during the opening narration by the director is a little janky, the music is loud enough that it is hard to hear what he's saying and occasionally the mood of the music doesn't quite match the tone of the scene. I will add the orchestral and quartet music was beautiful.Overall, an amazing story, and though I didn't know who Gothix was when it started, I am inspired by her journey and was proud to witness it through the film and hope to meet her someday.",False
11,10,Awesome!,selmalushlash,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this, this was amazing. This shows how much of a clown world, we unfortunately live in and how everything has to be race related. I felt so bad for Gothix but this definitely mold her and made her see how insane these people are. In a way I'm grateful for what happened to her because it made her become an amazing person. What a smart, well spoken, and a beautiful person Gothix is. She has come a long way and it is well deserved. It also always awesome to see an alternative looking person to with a similar mindset and beliefs. It's definitely a breath of fresh air. Always enjoy your content. Good job Gothix!",False
12,10,Fantastic micro-bio,jasonfarleys,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI love the way this story is told! Taking a small but intense portion of a person's life and telling it in detail like this is amazing. And the way Gothix story of getting cancelled and seeing the way she walks through it and comes out the other side in such a better place...it's amazing!My seventeen year old daughter said, ""every teenager in the country needs to see this!"" Her observation: we don't think of the people on the other end of the internet as real people with real lives. Canceling someone is the worst!""I really enjoyed the movie and highly recommend it. Hope you'll watch it! üëçüëçüëç",True
13,10,"Poignant, and Inspiring.",thedanteaaricks,n/a,16/08/2025,"What began as a horrific glimpse into the bleak reality of modern human interactions turned into a tale of hope, perseverance, and finding one's self while rising from the ashes of who they once were.Vanessa's journey is one that many people walk. This is an age of overstimulation, undernourishment, and endless vitriol. The weak devour the strong, and then each other. Culpability has become antiquated, and sacrilege. We live in a cacophony of misinformation, and misery addiction. It makes our own personal worlds that much smaller, and feeling as though we're under constant threat of having it all collapse. However, sometimes that's what it takes to finally see the truth.Cancel culture is just a word, and this documentary proves it. A subjective social construct that only carries as much meaning as the individual gives it. We go through many cycles in life, and the pain of rebirth varies from what was lost. Vanessa found the way to her own light after sinking into the darkest abyss, and core values uncontaminated by social pressure, or the current zeitgeist. She fell far just to rise higher than ever before.",False
14,9,Well produced and well done,singjs,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this film. I became aware of Gothix/Vanessa about 2-3 years ago, when I saw one of her videos about BLM. I looked into her history as a Twitch streamer and her eventual journey to becoming a Christian. What a ride it has been! This film is lovingly made, and all of the production levels are exactly where you would expect them to be for a 2023 documentary. In my view, Vanessa's appeal is her quirky sense of humor, her charisma and her willingness to change, despite enormous opposition. ""Gothix"" does a great job at capturing each step of her journey and it ends with a truly heartfelt moment. Definitely worth the watch and Loor gives you a 7-day trial, so you can watch for free right now (12/23/2023)!",False
15,10,inspiring,meganstroup,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDocuments the journey of a young woman who overcame cancel culture, through self growth, integrity, bravery, and perseverance. Vanessa, or Gothix-as her viewers know her- was an up and coming youtuber, who despite identifying as a liberal herself, was ostracized for expressing a reasonable opinion. Despite being bullied and harassed, censored, and canceled she regained her place on social media by being true to herself and her beliefs, and has open, honest and respectful conversation with people of all political beliefs-bringing people who wouldnt normally convrse with one another together to share and discuss different ideas.",True
16,8,Worth more than one watch,Papa_Sarge,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story: An accurate account of internet influencer Vanessa Rosa (aka Gothix) that tells how she started as a Twitch streamer, endured cyberbullying on social media for an opinion, hiatus from social media, and her comeback on YouTube with a new audience and a new perspective on life.The visuals: Nice background effects at certain times that showcase the social media posts. Interview segments are done well. Contains one or two out-of-focus segments that are a little distracting.The music: Daniel Joseph White and Will Jeurgens are the main composers of this documentary. There were two cues that I appreciated: one was a solo piano piece to showcase the somber tone of a scene and the other was a triumphal piece during the segment of Gothix's social media comeback. The rest of the cues were ambience/mood music. There is no memorable theme in this documentary.The characters: The cast plays themselves unscripted and interview style. The footage of Gothix and Saul moving from place to place captures their genuine reactions and interactions. These segments have a home movie feel to them.The verdict: The Gothix documentary is an engaging film that is worth more than one single watchthrough. Although it is not a masterpiece, it is evident that director Graeme Wilson put great effort into every scene of this film. I recommend watching this film: 8/10 stars.",False
17,10,Insightful view into online cancel culture.,yamyule,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really appreciated the opportunity to see into the life of someone undergoing cancel culture online. The candid nature of the interviews and honest presentation was gripping and entertaining. I'm sure many people feel kinship with Vanessa for being ostracized from their friend groups. What most people can't imagine is how it feels to be famous and be canceled.It's hard every time you lose a friend to difference of opinion, let alone a full-on cancel mob of friends, followers and anyone else who thinks their opinion is important.I'm glad she found her way through what must have felt like a nightmare. Her YouTube channel is great and I highly recommend this documentary and following her there.",False
18,10,Hard to watch and such a good ending,dan-80265,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was hard to watch and listen to sometimes because of the difficulties Gothix went through and language.Then when the story starts to turn around it really is a sweet redemption ark. This is the first documentary that moved me so much that I had tears at the end and said, ""LETS GOOOOOO!"" and stood up and clapped- and I wasn't even at a theater or opening night.Graeme Wilson made something here that is truly worth seeing. To say it's a story of transformation is to make it to simple. It's like the documenting of someone dead coming to life.I would like to see more documentaries like this.",False
19,10,Honest & Compelling,soderberggregory,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was well crafted and compelling. It tells a story that is becoming too common--being canceled for having an opinion (even though it is unpopular). The message is ultimately inspiring--keep doing your best, no matter what people say, because excellence will eventually be recognized!You can definitely tell that the director has a background in music videos because the pace of the film is crisp and poetic. Although the film has a bit of a slow start, it goes through a couple plot swerves that will surprise audiences. It's also fun to see the personal element in the relationship that develops between the director and the main character. This film is really a documentary about their developing friendship and the power of truth to bring people of all types and backgrounds together.",False

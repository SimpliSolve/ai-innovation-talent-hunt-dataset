1,7,The way of watching on the spot,satindoge,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""Occupy the Legislative Council"" is a collection of images from Hong Kong documentaries on the incident of the 7.1 demonstrators entering the Legislative Council last year. Due to the limitation of shooting, the images are basically only presented from the unilateral perspective of the demonstrators outside the glass wall, while the police and public officials inside the glass wall are basically in a silent shooting state. In most cases, the footage is on the front line of the incident, capturing the different voices and actions of the demonstrators on the day of the incident. The most interesting aspect of the film is the disclosure of the photographer's presence. During the retreat in the second half of the film, she was stimulated by smoke bombs to cough, and then as the lens moved, the shadow of the photographer-the person holding the camera under the street lamp was finally revealed; and in the last shot of the film, she went back to the building. The photographer's magnified gasp in the empty chamber. These traces of presence have been completely preserved, making the audience realize that this is not only a news report, but may also be evidence of presence.",True

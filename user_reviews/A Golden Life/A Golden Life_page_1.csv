1,2,Boring and confusing proposition,Rodrigo_Amaro,n/a,16/08/2025,"This entry from Burkina Faso was shown at the Mostra Internacional de Cinema de SÃ£o Paulo, though I'm not sure if it got a
presential showing. It got a limited online view at the platform of the festival and I'm glad I didn't had to pay for it, cause it'd be
a waste of money. A documentary (sort of, but that's the genre mentioned) that fails to engage with viewers, to actually see life happening
or the ways a teenage boy quickly grows as a man while working on gold mines to secure a better future. If it's a documentary it gets a
quite unusual approach where we follow the boys in their routine, over and over again, with some small talks about what they're doing or
sharing stories about unfortunate tragedies, and we don't get a closer look with them or some interview telling us why they're there or
what they hope to achieve if finding the gold. And because of that distance, there were times I kept thinking that we were seeing actors
instead of real people, and even if there's the issue of being a re-telling of events, it still didn't work. It worked for some dozing off
moments that I'm ashamed to admit. Very helpless and awfully repetitive with what it had to show. 2/10.",False

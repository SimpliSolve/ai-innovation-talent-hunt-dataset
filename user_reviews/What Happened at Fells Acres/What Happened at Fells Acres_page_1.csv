1,10,The biggest witch trial since the Salem hangings,baastan-16837,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWatch local police and politicians alike destroy an entire family. If you lived through this in the 80's you will remember all the copy cat accused from the McMartin trials of California. This one and North Carolina were simultaneously evolving. This short piece takes you step by step through the hysteria. No justice was ever given to the Amirault family to this day. This case is now used in many law schools on how not yo try a case, there were little to no interviews with the other employees who worked in this school and some were held for many hours and coerced into potentially signing documents plied with lies of fictitious accounts of abuse. They are all victims, and if you follow the money youll see why this all played out.",True
2,10,TRUTH.,sttiger-18248,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOne of these cases happened in my hometown, Lorain Ohio. Brainwashed children, led to evidence by positive reinforcement of the complete lie stories the investigators drove to have the children say. They tell the truth, they get a frowny face with leading stories and a change in personality, and when the witness stuttered in line with the lie, big smiles and positive reinforcement. These are the same brainwashing techniques Parental Alienators use on thier own children to make them hate and testify agaisnt thier own fathers. It is actually done by police to get low IQ suspects to confess. Then there is the whole law system that does not care if someone is innocent. They care about thier own careers and/ or keeping the jails full.",True

1,10,A beautiful and emotional tribute,mdykes-83945,n/a,15/08/2025,"A beautiful homage to Ronnie (and Pete King his business partner), to the wonderful music but also to post-war London and Soho. Amazing footage of so many artists too - Miles, Dizz, Nina Simone, Sarah Vaughan, Ella. Roland Kirk my fave. Untold stories that I never knew as well. Evocative, beautiful film that sums up everything we love about this legendary spot, about jazz and about London town.",False
2,10,Ronnie Scott and All That Jazz,d3lta_mike,n/a,15/08/2025,"Expanding on the already excellent 'Ronnie Scott and All That Jazz' aired in1989 on acclaimed BBC series Omnibus this is a labor of love celebrating the founding of Ronnie Scott's Jazz club in 1959. Featuring previously unseen and unheard performances as well as interviews with some of the most iconic figures in music, this brilliant docmentary explores the club's 60-year history and shines a light on the uncompromising men and women who both built it and who took to its stage. Named after the late tenor saxophonist who founded the club in London's bohemian district of Soho in 1959 with fellow saxophonist and business partner Pete King, Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club was inspired by the vibrant postwar music scene in New York and quickly became the city's most famous music venue. Since then the club has consistently played host to the world's greatest musical legends, including Chet Baker, Sonny Rollins, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Roland Kirk, Buddy Rich, Oscar Peterson and Nina Simone. Ronnie Scott was among the earliest British musicians influenced by Charlie Parker and became one of the finest saxophone players in Europe. His chief motivation in starting a jazz club was to create a space where he and his contemporaries were free to play modern, forward-thinking music. Ronnie was beloved by many, from the great and famous who frequented his club to the many hard-up musicians who were often helped by his warmth and generous spirit. However, Ronnie was as complex and colorful as the music played on his stage. In private, Ronnie battled with depression, and when his untimely death occurred in 1996, it left the jazz community bereft of a respected and favorite leader.",False

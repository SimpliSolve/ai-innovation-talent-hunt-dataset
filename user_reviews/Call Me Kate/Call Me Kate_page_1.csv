1,6,Call me a bit disappointed,justahunch-70549,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was looking forward to this about an actress and person I've long admired, but I found this to be somewhat disappointing. There's little here that is new other than some audio tapes that are sometimes hard to understand, and not terribly revelatory, and some nice home movie clips of when she was young. She was quite the force to reckon with, highly intelligent, charismatic and uniquely beautiful. The film clips are wonderful, though almost all too short with many overlooked entirely. Some of her comments are insightful and she was a woman way ahead of her time and an actress unlike any other. Just ask whoever is trying to impersonate her here, which is one of the major problems with this documentary. The narration by a person attempting, poorly, to sound like her and to present this in sort of a first person narrative just doesn't work very well at all nor does a person pretending to be her from behind, in the shadows, etc. I nearly turned this off due to these contrived annoyances, but I still find the subject matter interesting despite reading about her for decades. I was hoping to learn something new, but perhaps she has been covered so much for so long that there simply is nothing new. Most of the balance of the narrative is presented by those who were not close, if at all, to her simply due to time marching on. Still, she was a fascinating and strong woman who lived a life most of us can only dream of. One of the more prominent comments from her, the real her, made here is about how lucky and appreciative she was to have the parents she did. We too can thank them. Odd near the end, this is not a very strong piece of filmmaking which I get the impression mostly exists due to the existence of those old scratchy audio tapes.",False
2,7,Objective documentary,phuutthaidai,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting and objective doc on Katharine Hepburn. It gives an honest and balanced portrayal of the kind of person she was. I enjoyed the objectivity of it, with many surviving family members giving their insights. It doesn't overly glorify her or unnecessarily undermines. I'm quite neutral to her celebrity and found this worth my time. There is a great deal about her childhood and the family she grew up in before her acting career. Included are audio recordings of interviews in her own voice though much is read by a voice actor. My personal takeaway is that once she knew she wanted to be famous, she became basically a quite selfish person. Not completely heartless but ultimately very self-absorbed and only attuned to what she wanted.",False
3,8,katharine hepburn had style,ksf-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"A netflix documentary on kathryn hepburn. Her life, career, and relationship with spencer tracy. Brash, independent, headstrong. Coming from an activist mother and a progressive, upper class father, it set up kathryn for a successful move to hollywoood. Combine that with a family tragedy that pushed her to be the best she could be. Interviews with kate and her brother. Bursting on the scene in 1932, 1933, she gives it her all. Some success, some bombs, then more successes. Howard hughes. Kate becomes a producer, wheeling and dealing. And much smarter now. Buying and selling stories, deciding if she wants to star in it, still pushing women's rights. It's good! Nothing too new, no big revelations here, but it's so interesting to watch. Directed by lorna tucker. Check it out. She had style. Like her character in ""desk set"", even while she was repressed, we knew she was destined for bigger things!",False
4,6,Overly Familiar Material While Skirting Major Questions,jsmithano,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMuch of the material presented here is overly familiar: Hepburn's close-knit family, her older brother's suicide at 16, her Bryn Mawr education, her marriage, her struggles as a young actress, her comeback after being declared ""box office poison,"" her love affair with Spencer Tracy.I really wanted to know more about her relationship with Tracy. For years I've heard that both of them were gay and had scores of same-sex lovers and that the scandal of having an adulterous relationship was preferable to having the truth known. But the documentary does not address this issue at all. The most we get is one of her nephews speaking generally about her sexual orientation saying that some of it or all of it may have been true but she would have thought it was nobody's business.She was a major movie star and a public figure. If her life was nobody's business why are we watching this documentary? Our interest isn't mere prurience, a need to hide one's sexual orientation shapes one's life.The documentary has an actress reading from Hepburn's letters. She does not sound like Hepburn and it is distracting.",True
5,9,Well Constructed Documentary,Sarah423,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary covers an iconic actress whose life is well known.But the film uses very good primary sources, mainly actual interviews, and the editing is first rate.I don't think I learned anything dramatically new, but the way the subject is arranged brought some new insights into the information.If nothing else, it's interesting to have a documentarian openly discussing gender and orientation. (As Hepburn herself would have been open to doing--as she actually did on tape in years past.)Katharine Hepburn was ahead of her time. She may well still be ahead of our time. Because the woman lived a truly authentic life without the usual self-limiting worries most of us have.",False
6,9,"Full of joy and spirit! Watching this is transformative, it takes your way to a better place in time.",MyMovieTVRomance,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOh, to live the life of the bourgeoisie back in the days of glamor gone by. Her life seems so fun, I'm up until her brother's death. I'm not all the way done with the documentary yet, but it makes me want to live in her era of you so badly! I've always liked that era, but to live it as well and freely as she did, while still having the sophisticated lure of the glamor of the time is so perfect! Just perfection!I'm not even a huge Hepburn fan, but there's something infectiously joyful about the way this documentary has been made, so that we pick up on Kate's own Joy of life. And it makes me very happy. If you want to be happy, and feel like you are taking a trip to a more glamorous and classy time, all without being stuck up, all while being down to earth, watch this documentary!",True
7,8,A lovely portrait of an extraordinary woman,bbewnylorac,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some critics here have been very harsh on this documentary. But I found it very informative and sweet. Sure, for those already very familiar with Katharine Hepburn's life and work, there may not be a lot that's new. But I had not known a lot about her and so I learned a lot. It is an affectionate piece, obviously, with input from her family and from the family of her lover Spencer Tracy, but what's wrong with that? Hepburn was unlucky in that Tracy was married and so she did not get to have a traditional relationship, except for in Tracy's final years when she lived with him. But mostly in her life Hepburn was very lucky indeed. She happened to meet people in Hollywood who liked and encouraged her, who wrote for her and directed her in some of the top movies of her day. She had a wonderful and wealthy family including a wise, steadfast and feminist mother, she had good people around her as her assistants and friends. Even her first husband sounds like he was a very nice man, even though she admits she broke his heart. But aside from being lucky, Hepburn also was courageous and intelligent in standing up for herself so that she was paid well, could dress the way she wanted and did not have to compromise and play the sex object like many other actresses. Her mother taught her to get back up when she was down. Hepburn has a reputation for being somewhat cold emotionally but this documentary gives a more rounded insight into her life and character. She paved the way for female actors and characters to be actual characters as opposed to love interests, and she lived her life as she wanted it to be.",False
8,4,A mess,cstumpo-26838,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found the film to be a mess. Using a character actor only seen from the back to represent Kate in various aspects of her life was annoying. The actual tapes of her speaking were not for the most part able to be understood. Hearing a Larry King interview while seeing other film clips or stills, not knowing who he was interviewing - annoying. The style of watching someone take notes from the tape recording while the narrator spoke of aspects of her life was confusing. It seemed like a high school film project gone wrong. It did provide the actual facts of her life but presented in jumbled mess.",False
9,5,Call Me Kate,henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary looking at the life of 4 times oscar winner Katherine Hepburn. With an apparent shortage of actual Hepburn footage, it uses created narration using someone doing an impression of the star, mixed with original footage. The film does look to analyse Hepburn as a character and what drove her forward from child through to her nineties, rather than focus as much on the specifics of her film career. There is inevitably also quite a close look at her love life particularly Spencer Tracy.It's an interesting if not very emotionally engaging experience and with little footage of Hepburn available, the various tricks being used to tell her tale aren't wholly successful.",False
10,5,Annoying,marie_lathers,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't finish this. For one thing, it seems to be trying to be an art film of its own, so it shouldn't be called a documentary. Not that documentaries can't be made in an artful, fascinating, way, but this falls flat. I couldnt figure out who was talking and why. Why is Kate seemingly talking about herself in an interview when she is not in fact interviewed. Plus, I question the filmmaker's research. She states that Morning Glory is Hepburn's second film. Not true, The second film is Christopher Strong, with Morning Glory third. Christropher Strong, directed by the amazing Dorothy Arzner, is an incredible movie, but here it only gets short shrift. I assume that's because the director didn't bother to watch it. It's a feminist movie in which Hepburn plays a record-breaking pilot. It's possible to see, but you have to put in the time to find it . . .",False
11,5,Interesting for those who haven't followed her career,OneAnjel,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think this film is probably most interesting to those who don't feel they already know everything there is to know. I see review after review complain the narration was bad but I thought it was really good as well as a nod to the producers' for making such an effort. I'm not particularly a fan but Kate was a good friend to my best friend - a controversial man in the entertainment industry before his passing. So I have great regard for her. As an actress, I thought she was very tom boyish and seeing her always-present side-kick it doesn't take a genius to know only someone in love with you would follow you every where and be at your beck and call. That's not to say it was reciprocal. But having a famous friend in the industry, I've seen more than my share of fans who begged to be used, just like Luddy. I've witnessed first-hand my friend being called gay when he was far from it. My point is, much of this film is speculation and gossip and must be taken with a grain of salt. There were other tougher women in the industry who came before Kate. I can't imagine how tempting it is to take advantage of people who just beg for it and take advantage of every foot hold you can find as a woman back then. But clearly she was from an extremely dysfunctional abusive family so I find it interesting she describes it as an idealic childhood. In her day she was very unique and head strong, not unlike Lucille Ball who was turned down so many times she started her own production company and you know how that went.",False

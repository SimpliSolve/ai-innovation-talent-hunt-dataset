1,8,Touching and Heartfelt Yet Tragic and Heart-wrenching,dthompson-38812,n/a,16/08/2025,"The beautiful filming of nature is exquisite in this film as it is portrayed in the midst of a devastating war-zone. The families depicted in the film are warm, talented, compassionate and giving, yet they are living in a world of destruction, danger, fear and devastation. Finding hope in the middle of a desperate and almost hopeless situation shows the strength and determination of the Uranian people as they determinedly protect the homeland they love. The film left me with such anger that a larger threatening country can destroy lives of peaceful existence of kind, compassionate and good people and replace it with hatred, evil and selfishness. My heart is with the people of the Ukraine with hopes that they can hold on to their beloved land and restore life one day as it should be lived in all countries around the world.",False
2,8,Shout-out to Dakha Brakha for the entire soundtrack!,dho1,n/a,16/08/2025,"One does not normally attend wartime documentary films with joyful anticipation, but this film has been so well designed and produced that you go for the sake of the art while possibly dreading the war part. No need to be anxious, because, In fact, both aspects are so beautifully filmed and well integrated that the war -- with all its closeup and graphic action -- is not offputting. Instead, the balance is just right and the message is unmistakable. Huge kudos to Dakha Brakha for enhancing the entire soundtrack with their powerful, inimitable gorgeous sound. Last but not least, as a professional translator I can say that the subtitles are flawless.",False
3,6,Beautiful visually looking documentary with a little unfocused approach,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.This documentary is pretty interesting as it explores the themes of the works of art, beauty of culture and nature, and the troubled conflicts between Ukraine and Russia. The filmmakers were able to capture the beauty and ugliness of the situation of war, politics, art, and humanity as many of the camerawork was able to show the great visual landscapes of Ukraine and the ugly parts of war with strong presentation, animation, and good sound designs throughout.Due to the subject and the sensitivity, it does provide some interesting conversations and themes to explore. Which is one of it's faults because while the documentary was engaging, some of the structure feels a little unfocused on what the filmmakers are really wanting to tell or how to approach. Some of the editing choices were a little rough and certain interview discussions felt underwhelming and lacked the impact it thinks it's offering.There are some themes and aspects I did wish was approached better because having seen other war documentaries about the Russia and Ukraine conflict, it does offer some themes that weren't new and did made certain aspects slow.But undeniably, the filmmakers have a passion and I understand what point of view they are coming from. Overall, solid watch.",False
4,7,Between Creation and Destruction,pinkmanboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Porcelain War"" has an incredibly powerful premise, blending art and war as two sides of the same coin. But in the end, it seems to hesitate when it comes to tapping into the deeper, more unsettling potential it carries. Following Ukrainian artists who refuse to abandon their craft even in the face of destruction and imminent danger, the film holds a weighty concept in its hands: art as resistance, as a way to reaffirm a culture at risk of being erased. However, despite its visual impact and the strength of its subjects, the narrative often settles for a more digestible path, avoiding a dive into the more provocative layers the story suggests.The choice to follow Slava Leontyev and Anya Stasenko, artists and life partners, works as an emotionally effective anchor. The delicacy of their work-miniature porcelain figures decorated with intricate paintings-stands in stark contrast to the devastation around them, and the film makes great use of this opposition, creating imagery that evokes a tragic lyricism. The fact that they remain on the front lines, choosing to keep creating while also contributing to the armed resistance, adds extra weight to the narrative. Andrey Stefnov, the photographer documenting much of the war and longing to reunite with his family, adds another human layer to the story. And, of course, there's Frodo, the little terrier who offers brief moments of tenderness in the midst of chaos.The cinematography in ""Porcelain War"" is, without a doubt, one of its strongest aspects. The use of drone shots-capturing both the destruction and the military tactics-creates an unsettling juxtaposition between the artistic gaze and the brutality of war. At times, the film reaches an almost poetic level, especially when it places Slava and Anya's creations amid the ruins, symbolizing Ukrainian cultural resilience. But it's precisely in its constant effort to reinforce this metaphor that the documentary starts to feel predictable, as if it keeps circling back to the same point without delving into new depths.And this is where ""Porcelain War"" shies away from fully exploring some of the more uncomfortable questions it raises. Art is presented as a symbol of resistance, but the film only scratches the surface of the complexities that come with the transition between creating and destroying. The impact of war on the artists' identities and how this collision alters their perception of their own work comes up in certain moments, but it's never fully developed. Instead of leaning into these contradictions, the documentary pulls back into safer territory, reinforcing its uplifting message without really challenging it.That's not to say ""Porcelain War"" is ineffective. It delivers striking visuals, compelling subjects, and a theme that, by itself, makes it an important film. But there's a lingering sense that it could have been more than just an ode to resilience-it could have dug deeper into the ambiguities and contradictions that arise when artistic survival intertwines with real combat. In the end, ""Porcelain War"" is moving and visually stunning, but it falls short of being the truly provocative film it had the potential to be.",False
5,9,"Beautiful, touching and inspiring! Artfully done.",emiliaparr,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film premier at Sundance Film Festival this year. This story about 3 Ukrainian artists living in a war zone was eye opening, intense, inspiring and hopeful.You really connect with the subjects of the film as you walk through their world with them (and their military unit and loved ones), hear their stories (both happy and sad), feel their hurt, and listen to their hopes.The use of imagery and art to convey their story is beautifully done and so effective. The contrast of the war scenes with nature and art are incredibly well done and balanced. The music throughout is all Ukrainian, which immerses you even more. It is absolutely artfully filmed.",False
6,7,art and war,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. While we have grown accustomed to movies about war, this documentary is a true and stunning war movie. There are no special effects or stunt doubles or guns with blanks. The bombs are as real as the three people bringing us an all too intimate look at the war.Slava Leontyev creates porcelain figurines, and his wife Anya Stasenko paints them - often with color and inspiration from nature. Slava and Anya are dedicated artists and it's art that connects them to their friend Andrey Stefanov. Slava and Anya bring the personal aspect to this film, while Andrey's work with the camera speaks the horrific truth. The war in Ukraine began in 2022, and when we meet Slava and Anya, they are in Kharkiv, a mere 25 miles from Russia.""We are ordinary people in an extraordinary situation."" What initially hits as such an understatement, soon make sense as we watch Slava and Anya go about living within their new reality ... a reality that involves warning sirens, underground shelters, and the whistle of incoming bombs that lead to explosions causing and property damage and human deaths. The tenacious and disrespected Ukrainian army is made up mostly of civilians willing to fight for their country after the invasion. Slava spends a good amount of time training civilians on basic firearm usage. It's quite a contrast to his art, yet both are crucial.We are told, ""If one doesn't stop evil, it keeps going"" ... a lesson we hope world leaders understand. The homes and lives of these folks will never be the same, but as they explain, stories told through art prevent erasure. Andrey states, ""Bad people are not as creative at being bad, as good people are at being good."" We hope he's right and we hope that matters. These stories are told amidst craters and rubble and incoming missiles. The danger and urgency of each minute ensures the horror is always as present as their pet pooch, Frodo. It is explained to us that porcelain and Ukraine are similar in that they both break but are nearly impossible to destroy. Co-directed by Brandon Bellomo and Slava Leontyev, this was the Grand Jury Prize winning documentary at Sundance.PORCELAIN WAR will open in theaters, beginning on November 22, 2024 in NYC, on November 29 in Los Angeles, followed by a roll out across North America.",False
7,10,Amazing documentary!,Sybiraczka55,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was at the premiere of this amazing documentary. There was not a dry eye in the audience, with the film's subjects and its creators receiving a heartfelt, long-standing ovation after the screening.""Porcelain War"" stands out as a unique, cinematic piece that skillfully narrates the captivating journey of three artists amidst the backdrop of a war-torn country. It serves as a poignant testament to the struggles faced by ""ordinary people under extraordinary circumstances"" as one of the artists says.This powerful film serves as a reminder of the significance of preserving our humanity and identity, even under the most dire conditions. It evokes empathy for those compelled to defend these fundamental values often taken for granted.As an added bonus to the film's message, I enjoyed the amazing shots of nature and beautiful music.I am deeply touched by this film!",False
8,6,Primarily a morale-booster for the Ukrainian side,steiner-sam,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a documentary on three Ukrainian artists' lives in 2022-2023 during the war around the Kharkiv area. The three artists are Slava Leontyev, Anya Stasenko, and Andrey Stefanov. Slava and Anya work in small porcelain figures, Andrey is a visual artist and does much of the filming. There are scenes of daily life and their activities during the war. Some of the photography is quite creative. The background music is sometimes intrusive and sometimes well-matched to the images.""Porcelain War"" is primarily a morale-booster for the Ukrainian side. Hope versus uncertainty is inevitable when outcomes are unknown. In the future, this film will be a period piece showing one slice of the Russian invasion of Ukraine but does not offer new insights into a tragic setting.",False
9,10,Pure strike,mail-evagrin,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is worth a dear lot staying clear and pure in times like these.People creating magnificent art of tender porcelain under bombs do not only create paradox - they demonstrate us that the paradox is quite possible if one gets out of his own small box and looks outside.It turns out people still try to live their lives even being in grave daily danger, people still open their hearts to harmony and poetry of form and color.The world is full of darkness and atrocities but yet it is a place of genuine beauty and remarkable resilience.I dearly wish Slava and Anya as well as other Ukrainians overcome this wave of unspeakable blackness and their art will shine with even more colors.The figurines are such a perfect manifestation of human spirit.Thank you for capturing this on screen!",False
10,10,An Inspirational and Touching Film,nick-zechner222,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGoing into the film with little knowledge of what's it's about, I was absolutely stunned by the visuals, honestly and endurance that Slova and his team on the ground have accomplished. Seeing the film at the denver film fest, I had the pleasure of meeting these amazing human beings and speaking with them for a few moments. You can see the passion, the love and the humility that they embody.The plot of the film itself was touching, and gave a more engaging and first hand account of the war in the Ukraine. As well as the effects that it imposes on the civilians that are currently living in the war torn country. The art was beautiful, the film was gorgeous and heartbreaking, one the best films I've been this year.",True
11,3,A long commercial for war pretending to be anti-war.,hrssagas,n/a,16/08/2025,"The main problem I had with this film is how it softens war to an extreme. More than that, it uses classic propaganda techniques to the point of losing itself.The fact that the film appears to have been made by Ukrainians makes me expect it to have this kind of tone. That would not be a problem, as it is natural for a filmmaker to want to present their own perspective and support their country.The issue is that the film relies on beautiful scenery, depicts combat where death occurs at a distance and in a controlled manner, shows soldiers laughing, and avoids mentioning or addressing tragedies. It is a film that makes war seem calm and that leads the viewer to believe they would become a great hero without facing many hardships. To compensate for this, at some point in the film, someone says that war is terrible, while in the background you see flowers and a scene of them defeating the enemy.",False
12,9,Artists Turned Warriors :: A Beautiful Film,Sil-Azevedo,n/a,16/08/2025,"There couldn't be a greater contrast than porcelain and war. This award-winning documentary, made by artists turned warriors, shows this very clearly. Through their eyes we see the beauty of Ukraine and the horrors of war. These are not professional filmmakers. They took up film to tell their story amidst uncertainty and pain. The result is a true cinematic experience that is real in every way. One can hear their heartbeat, feel the fear, hope, and resilience. The film won the 2024 Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, and has just been nominated for the Oscar. Somehow they were able to keep the tenderness through all of it. It has to be the art.",False
13,10,A nightmare within a dream,liciaswork,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautifully shot film exploring spaces of beauty within the confines of destruction. A story of love and art and survival. Anya's artwork is magical and magnificent, as is the cinematography. The natural beauty throughout Ukraine is stunning.I pray Ukraine wins this war, but they have lost so much already. So tragic what the ego of men inflict upon the human condition. It made me realize my normal life could change at any moment. The WSJ did a feature on one of the cities they highlight in the film, Bakhmut, it's worth a look.I hope all the people in this film will go on to live their regular lives very very soon.",False
14,10,Excellent in every way,maryknighthappy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beautiful and meaningful. It gave me a glimpse of what it would be like to be in a war zone. I usually can't watch films about war because of my PTSD, but this one was different. It contained such beautiful art, and many scenes of being out in nature. The cinematography was amazing. This film shows civilians becoming soldiers, not by choice but by necessity..... in order to protect their homes and families. I loved all the subjects that were in the film, including the cute little dog. It made me wonder what I would do in the same situation, and thankful that I will most likely never have to know what my personal choice would be.",False

16,9,Sundance Watch,bennetberlin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this film for the first time at its premiere at Sundance Film Festival 2024 and was very impressed. The sound, cinematography, editing, color grading are all fantastic. Slava Leontyev and Brendan Bellomo are both gifted storytellers. You really get to know each of the film's subjects. In a world full of depressing hopeless documentaries, this film really focuses on the idea of hope amid destruction, and it does not deviate from that message even during moments of wartime. Although war-torn Ukraine is well documented at this point, stories of its ordinary citizens, especially artists and those trying to put beauty back into the world, are not.",False
17,9,Artists as warriors,donlynaa,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautifully made film of three artists and their families, interrupted when their lives are invaded by a neighboring country. The choices that they make to not only survive, but to fight for their country's citizens. And for all of mankind's freedoms. Even their sweet dog, Frodo becomes a star as he barks at the bombs and comfort his caregivers. This is a must see beautiful film that you won't regret seeing. Even though it's about war, and it's dreadful what is happening, it's not made to be too difficult to watch. It's really beautifully done!I want more of Slava and Anya's art! More of Andrey's art and to see his family together again, forever.I'd give it a 10 if I didn't have to read subtitles. But that's just me.",False
18,10,Absolutely Spellbinding,Jude884,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is absolutely beautiful, saturated with textures, angles, and variety of subject matter. Your eye truly travels through the rich landscape, interrupted by the views of almost unbearable brutality that wars of conquest always bring.I really enjoyed the ease the characters show in front of the camera, and there is something very optimistic, very positive in the way heir love for creativity comes through.Recommend to anyone interested in contemporary documentary cinema. This is how it should be done. Inspiring visually, it also gives a great technical performance and deeply humane message of resilience and resistance. There is more to life than simply survival, to live meaningfully, in freedom, is the message.",False
19,10,An incredible documentary !,ivantitkovivan,n/a,16/08/2025,"An incredible documentary that sheds light on Ukrainian lives not through the lens of tragedy, but through how people truly live in these times - how artists use their craft as a weapon. With footage partly shot by the protagonists themselves, the film offers an intimate dive into the everyday reality of Anya and Slava. Special respect goes to those behind the musical score - the emotional depth and harmony with the visuals are absolutely striking.This film is yet another proof that Ukrainian cinema has a powerful future - and that war-related films can be told in many different ways.I definitely recommend watching it!",False
20,10,Breathtaking and heartbreaking,voododol,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such a beautiful movie about the everyday life of Ukrainian people. It tells 3 stories that are actually so common among regular Ukrainians during the full-scale invasion: someone leaves the country to save the kids, someone joins the army, and someone stays at home and waits for them one day to come back, as an anchor.This movie is not just war. There is a breathtaking footage of Ukrainian fields and forests. You will see courage, strength, love, dedication, art. A lot of art! It's unbelievable that some people can create beauty during ugly times.Please watch it, you will not regret it. We left the Toronto Ukrainian Film Festival speechless.",False

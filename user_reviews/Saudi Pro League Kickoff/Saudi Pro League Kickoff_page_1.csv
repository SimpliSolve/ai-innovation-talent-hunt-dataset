1,1,"Sportswashing, not genuine celebration of football",UltraHuuhkaja,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary series begins by emphasizing Saudi Arabia's deep passion for football and its rich footballing history. However, the focus is primarily on foreign stars.Carefully curated visuals of fans passionately celebrating in packed stadiums aim to depict the games as euphoric spectacles. However, the reality is a different story. Attendance figures reveal the gap: the four major clubs owned by the state's wealth fund (PIF) average between 17,000 and 25,000 fans per game, while no other team exceeds 10,000. The league-wide average attendance stands at just over 8,000, lower than England's third tier or Sweden's Allsvenskan. Empty seats in the stadiums are skillfully edited out, though a sharp eye can spot them in a few frames.Ultimately, the series comes across as a calculated example of sportswashing. Rather than a genuine celebration of football, it serves as a PR effort to divert attention from deeper issues and project an idealized image of Saudi Arabia to the global stage.",False

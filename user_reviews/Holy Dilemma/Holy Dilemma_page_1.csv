1,8,"Great story, bad directing",Pensionar,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story is really good which is the main selling point of the documentary, it catches your attention, but it takes a while to get into it so you will have to be a little patient.Also, the whole movie directing is at an amateur level which makes the documentary even harder to watch, from people watching the cameraman to bad video and sound editing, just bare that in mind.I will give it an 8/10 because it is worth to watch considering the fact that the problems involved in it are up to date, the Catholic Church needs to change and maybe this documentary will bring light to some in power.At the time of writing this review I saw this documentary online on HBO Max. A small remark is that the subtitles aren't as accurate as one would expect.",False

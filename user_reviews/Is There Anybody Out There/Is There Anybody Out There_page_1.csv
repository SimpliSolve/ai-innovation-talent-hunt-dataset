1,7,Is There Really Anyone Out There?,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival.""Is There Anybody Out There?"" is a documentary about a filmmaker who inhabits and loves her unusual body searches the world for another person like her, and explores what it takes to love oneself fiercely despite the pervasiveness of ableism. The film presents an nice insight about the struggles of a woman with dwarfism and how her situation has impacted her personal life.Throughout, the direction offers pretty good insight on the disease of dwarfism and how it impacts the filmmakers journey. There are good discussions, music and style throughout and some moments were pretty touching.Overall, a pretty good documentary.Rating: B.",False
2,6,Is There Anybody Out There?,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ella Gledining presents us here with an emotionally charged documentary that follows her search for people with a similar disability to herself. She has a rare bone disorder which essentially means that she has bones missing from her legs. Aside from some fairly tortuous surgery when she would have been young, followed by some prosthetics, she was destined to remain smaller but otherwise just as intellectually capable, vibrant and ambitious as anyone else. We follow her determination to have a family (with the sparingly featured Scott) and then her own quest to use the internet to find others with whom she can share experiences, chat and perhaps bond. Glendining is an engaging lady who seems very much from the glass half full school of philosophy. Even when clearly exhausted - mentally and physically, she retains an optimism that together with their young son River seems to help sustain her when the black clouds loom. As ever, though, with one person filmmaking, it's not always the most objective of analysis about much of the rest of the population whom she routinely defines as ""ableist"". Her assertions that society suffers from this flaw is fairly flawed in itself. What is society? It isn't just some sort of concrete jigsaw puzzle into which her tiny piece uncomfortably fits. It's a myriad of different people, personalities, abilities, attitudes - and not many, I suspect, are actually as hostile or indifferent to those less able as she seems to think. ""The world is better with the disabled in it""? Well who would argue? What is a disability anyway? Broader society is riddled with racism, homophobia, intolerances and we all live in a sort of Venn diagram model style of overlapping circles with each allowing for the differing aspects of human nature regardless as to how or if people may choose to compartmentalise themselves. Clearly this lady hasn't had a straightforward time, but she can come across as just a little inclined to paint everyone else with the same brush. A ""normal"" life is an entirely subjective term and what's great to see here is that she seems focussed on ensuring that her family have exactly that - work notwithstanding - and she presents us with an interesting look at just how she intends to live life to the full. Not perfect, but worth ninety minutes.",False
3,6,"""I love and respect my body""",evening1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBorn without hip joints, and with short thigh bones, Ella Glendining felt like ""a different species,"" and set out on a worldwide quest to find someone with a body just like hers.While she never found exactly such a person, she came up with a film introducing interesting people and situations, with much to teach us all about disability.A self-assured young Englishwoman with tattoos, multiple piercings, and a mane of blond hair, Ella searched the web to find people with related orthopedic conditions, caregivers and patients alike, grappling with choices over whether or not to seek surgery that could improve appearance and functionality.Along the way, we meet 26-year-old Ella's first boyfriend ever -- they met on Tinder and were expecting a baby as the movie was made -- her supportive parents, friends in the disabled community, and a handful of moms trying to figure out whether their kids should get corrective operations. Some say childhood is the optimal time for such surgery, while others advocate for the right of individuals to make their own choices in adulthood.Ella's mom considers herself fortunate -- such procedures didn't exist while Ella was growing up, so she didn't face the dilemma.One such mother considers an operation for her three-year-old daughter, with a goal of giving her ""one good leg, so she's not totally in a wheelchair.""The film raises questions as to whether it's advisable to encourage the disabled to look like everyone else.And Ella, seen both walking and using a wheelchair in the film, notes that wheelchair operators consider their rolling seats ""our freedom.""We see old film clips that shed light on how disability used to be viewed. In one instance, a thoughtful young boy without limbs discusses his interest in history while his mother, in another room, opines that he will ""never be able to marry.""Ella catches up with the man decades later, and, sure enough, he has a wife and two beautiful kids!Horizon limitations do seem far less common today. In the film, we meet one young man with severe bone abnormalities who takes to a stage as a comedian. And then there is a charming youtuber, Riccardo, who confides, ""No one's ever wanted to be like me.""We listen in on conversations that Ella has with friends. ""My body is quite shockingly different,"" one says, noting it's only human nature to register shock. ""It's about what you do after the shock that matters,"" she insightfully points out.Ella's mom admires her daughter's resilience, and her dad recalls that he wanted to protect her.""I enjoy life to the fullest,"" says Ella, who gave birth to a healthy baby boy, named River. ""There is no other me.""",True
4,9,Ella Glendidning's debut feature is a captivating cry for the disabled community.,theimaginaryprojectmarketing,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is There Anybody Out There? From Brighton-based director Ella Glendining is a self-professed love letter to the disabled community and anyone who has ever felt other. It is a formidable debut feature by a filmmaker who has refused to allow society's expectations or prejudices about her disability to stand in her way, instead using her tenacity to build a career in a notoriously difficult and ableist industry.Glendining embarked upon an emotional four year journey to tell her story. Is There Anybody Out There? Follows the filmmaker's global search for someone who may have experienced life from the same vantage point she has and over the course of the film takes us on a powerful journey of moving discoveries, sad truths and poignant intimate moments whilst remaining true to her own fierce love and acceptance of herself.",False
5,9,Similarities,tmccheyne,n/a,16/08/2025,"Could emphasise so much in respect of how able bodied people view us disabled people. I cannot state that my disability is the same, again we are all unique and there is no norm. I had polio when I was three years of age, I do remember some fleeting moments of that time believe it or not. I was totally struck down to begin with, but within a period of time only my left leg was affected...making it shorter and little to no muscle. Eventually I wore steel calipars on my affected leg. Surgery intervention to fix foot and ankle.I met with the bullying, name calling and not belonging as she did. Unfortunately being one of 4 and having problems at home I was sent to an ""open air school"" for most of my childhood.I like the one girl thought I'd be ""normal"" when I was an adult.I too had the strange weirdo men very attracted to me and with their attitude that I should be grateful, but having met and knowing that I was able to distinguish the ones who genuinely liked me for me.One thing as you mature you find that you can love who you are and realise that being different is great.I'm now in my 70s and have had a good life, worked all my years, have a loving hubby and although I am suffering pain more now due to over exerting my body I do not regret anything but wish I could tell my younger teenage self not to let others judge or upset me.Please watch this programme it delves into a lot of what disability can mean. We are stronger individuals than the able bodied can ever know.",False
6,1,I'm sorry,cancsajn,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was expecting a great documentary, but this was not it. The ambiguous positioning of a mirror at the dancing scene was already suspicious, but I had to turn it off at the bathroom selfie video. It's hard to see how these self-recorded videos qualify for a proper documentary, and showing boobs through the reflection of the bath tub just suggests the idea that this ""documentary"" is trying to prove something rather than giving an insight. It's just wrong when women think that nudity is the way to prove their greatness. It was disappointing and that was the moment I decided to turn it off. Hope the next one will be better.",True

1,7,A Revealing Walk in Someone Else's Shoes,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"They say you can never truly understand what it's like to feel what someone else experiences until you've walked a mile in his or her shoes. That's often been said about many of those in minority communities, and, thankfully, some progress in understanding appears to have been made in those cases over the years. But one segment of society in which little advancement has been made involves those who are appreciably bigger than many in the mainstream (i.e., those who are fat). For some reason, fat folks continue to be systematically marginalized - if not outright derided - in countless ways, and there's often been little that they can do about these pervasive attacks. Now, however, writer-director Jeanie Finlay's new documentary profile of author/podcaster/fat activist Aubrey Gordon sheds new light on what individuals affected by this condition face on a daily basis. This includes the persistent lack of meaningful accommodations in areas like effective health care, transportation and garment manufacturing, not to mention the ignorant, cruel, short-sighted and insensitive comments made by others, including those who mistakenly think they're operating from a standpoint of good intentions. The film explores Gordon's journey from an anonymous (and devastatingly ridiculed) blogger to best-selling author who came out of the closet about her weight circumstances and made public the often-overlooked anguish experienced by people of size. The film holds back little in terms of exposing the unbridled scorn thrust upon her and those who are similarly situated, while simultaneously celebrating the overflowing shower of support bestowed on her by others like her who now feel that there's someone in their camp to make their feelings and the truth of their circumstances known. The picture also goes on record exposing the many myths and lies that have been long perpetuated about fat people and the volumes of bad, uninformed advice they have received for decades, particularly from the medical community, many of whose members don't have a clue when it comes to what they're talking about. Admittedly, the material covered in the film could be a little better organized at times, especially when it turns redundant, as it does on several occasions. There is also a fair amount of unrelated incidental footage that probably could have been cut without losing much. However, this offering provides a wealth of information on the widely circulated misinformation about fatness, and, as anyone who has endured these conditions - like me, in the interest of full disclosure - can attest, it's refreshing and liberating to see an advocate step forward who is not afraid to call out those who are hurtful, ignorant and deceitful when it comes to this subject. ""Your Fat Friend"" draws all of these issues into focus and delivers a polite but undeniably pointed middle finger to those who perpetuate misguided attitudes and ideas that ultimately serve no one - yet end up unintentionally or deliberately hurting so many.",False
2,10,Beautiful,hjohnson-90791,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautiful telling of Aubrey's ascent and how the world around her responded. So touching and warm. I feared that a film about thriving while fat would feel bleak, but Jeanie has captured Aubrey's contentment and charm so beautifully that one goes away from the film with hope. Hope, and a desire to make the world a better place in any small way one can.I was surprised by the prominence of Aubrey's parents, but Jeanie's gentle pulling on a thread that exists in the life of every fat person, the thread of their parents' relationship with their body, is so validating for those with similar experiences, as well as being deeply touching.This film was not what I expected- it was more than I could have dreamed it would be.",False
3,9,"I laughed, I cried, I recommend it completely",rbkhbrns-08155,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Your Fat Friend"" was well-made and worth watching. I appreciated how the filmmaker allowed for subtlety.Aubrey's experience in this film shows just how much our society hates fat. It shows how this hatred carries down to the people closest to us, and is internalized by so many of us. Before we know it, we're judging and hurting our loved ones and ourselves, and we don't even notice we're doing it. And we don't know why we're doing it. This may be relatable to some, and eye-opening to others.Don't let yourself be on the ""wrong"" side of history when it comes to this issue. Watch it for yourself, your children, and for your fat friends.",False
4,10,Properly thoughtful and compelling exploration of critical topic,willielewis-46403,n/a,16/08/2025,"Based on deep critical analysis of the science combined with lived experience, Aubrey is charismatic, confident, and authentic in her commentary and observations of what is really going on and how we can support each other. The tone is compelling, thought-provoking, inclusive and loving. An excellent contribution to the dialogue in a world where myths about fat, fat people, food and diets is mainstream and endorsed by virtually every institution we are expected to rely on. The messages in this film need repeating over and over. This film is a great watch for learning, educating your loved ones, and being entertained and moved.",False
5,1,Delusional,bookwormcullen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Aubrey Gordon refuses to take any responsibility for the choices she's made in her life. She is so privileged and forces every other person in her life to admit to their ""transgressions"" against her. Aubrey acts like a spoiled child throwing a tantrum whenever a slight inconvenience occurs. Eating disorders and mental health are nothing to be taken lightly, and the blatant misinformation surrounding atypical anorexia is disgusting. The internet is a harsh place, but you can't call valid criticism ""cyber bullying"" when your bs is called out.If you want to watch 90 minutes of a woman constantly victimizing herself and claiming ""liberation"", then I guess this is for you. It's not worth the money, nor is it worth having to put up with Aubrey Gordon's entitlement.",False

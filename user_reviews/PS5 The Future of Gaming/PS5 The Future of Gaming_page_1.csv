1,3,A trailer to showcase PS5 top titles.,SniffnTears,n/a,16/08/2025,"This video mainly shows trailer and ingame footage of upcoming and/or now released PS5 titles. In between there are very brief interviews with some of the PS5 devs, whose statements tend to have promotional character. Most of the footage looks stunning. People who care about the PS5 or video games in general will likely find this entertaining and/or informative, but aside from that it has absolutely no documentary value. With the title being as bold as it gets viewers who do not know what they are getting into are bound to be disappointed.",False

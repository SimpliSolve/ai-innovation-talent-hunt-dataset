1,8,One of the great films of Spielberg's career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time,fernandoschiavi,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was born from the minds of some of the leading filmmakers of the moment, but an adventure that would become one of the leading film franchises. George Lucas had just created and launched two sci-fi classics with the first two chapters of the ""Star Wars"" saga while Spielberg was also already considered one of the most promising directors in Hollywood having effect astonishing successes with ""Jaws (1975)"" and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) "".Classic recipe for matinees adored by George Lucas, the work of screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan is one of the most consistent doing an excellent job of keeping to the basics: virtually all characters in The Raiders of the Lost Ark are based on archetypes, but none of them lack personality. Indy himself is one of the most famous characters in American cinema, fitting the profile of the classic action hero, but with several peculiarities that make him special, from his acid sense of humor, his clumsy way to achieve a goal and also his intelligence. All villains are purposefully shallow and Manichean, with Nazism incorporating all the evil on Earth in a cartoonish way, but that never sounds strange in this proposal.In ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", Spielberg makes his first openly action movie, even though ""Duel"", ""Jaws"" and ""1941"" had their setpieces there, here is a popcorn adventure from start to finish, and this is a category in which the filmmaker would become an expert. The opening scene alone is a lesson in how to introduce a character and his universe, with Spielberg's camera keeping a mystery about Indy's identity - Douglas Slocombe's photograph skillfully covers Ford's face with shadows - but building your personality and your iconic figure through frames that portray your courage and demonstrate your skills; see the closed planes of the hat, the leather jacket and the whip on the long belt before the protagonist draws it against an attacker. It is an aesthetic care and well elaborated by the filmmaker's camera game, which is maintained throughout the film's other numerous action sequences. Between shootings in bars, races to stop a truck and a fist fight on an airstrip, what most charm the project is the ability of the filmmaker to create an atmosphere of tension that embarks on a frantic and good-natured adventure. is one of the great strengths of the feature, guaranteeing the film never to lose its rhythm, while the characters go over obstacle after obstacle, as in a real board game. Spielberg's ability to command the action is present in the most ""naive"" scenes, such as the snake pit or the fight in the Nazi plane, even in the most elaborate ones, such as the chase of trucks involving Jones and several soldiers.Classic backstage story, it was Harrison Ford's suggestion that Indy, when faced by a skilled swordsman in the Cairo market, simply shoot his opponent instead of starting an elaborate fight with his whip - as the script originally said. A sensational improvisation that came out of the mere fact that Ford and several members of the team were sick because of the heat and the local food, and that perfectly ended up defining one of Indy's personality traits. Throughout two other action scenes, the hero ""asks"" an opponent to wait while he prepares to return to the fight, and casually answers one of his colleagues who asks him what his plan is: ""I don't know, I invent on the way"". Priceless phrases and actions, and that only Harrison Ford would be able to deliver with such charisma and naturalness, in what is definitely the most striking role of his remarkable career. Ford is loose, unlike what he commonly complained of Han Solo here he can show some more facets and not a predominant one as is the extremely obvious scoundrel antihero. He is incredulous that the journey he will take will result in something really in the encounter with something divine in fact, in addition to being able to represent well the teacher for whom his students sigh, besides of course to reproduce the cliché of forbidden love for someone of the past, In this case, Marion, the strong and feminine character of Karen Allen, a woman who is clearly not a full-time damsel in distress.With special care for the action, what is also striking is how Spielberg maintains his same technical eye for the most expository scenes. For example, the scene where Indy and Brody (Denholm Elliott) are approached by government officials, and the archaeologist explains the Ark of the Covenant myth to them, Spielberg films much of the dialogue in an open plan with all four characters there, well-disposed through a mise en scène that puts the agents - and the spectator - in a classroom, where Indy even uses the blackboard to present some concepts that will become important in the future; an exhibition that does not sound forced, after all the protagonist is in fact a teacher. We also see Spielberg's brand developing, where the filmmaker works on long shots that always change the characters' positions and the graceful movement of the camera, giving the strong impression that a cut has happened, but remaining in the same shot. Iconography is also a factor that Spielberg and Slocombe masterfully explore, as in the scene where Indy visits Marion in her bar, casting a giant shadow on the girl, but being Marion a fearless woman - and the most memorable one in the archaeologist's gallery - she is very capable of opposing the presence of Indy, and the shadow soon fades over the course of the conversation.The master of Star Wars songs, conductor John Williams had already been working with Spielberg since ""Jaws"", and not tired of delivering memorable themes, he reaches one of the culminations of his career with the Indiana Jones musical piece. It is a cheerful, adventurous and even flashy theme, which summarizes all the feelings and themes of the franchise, as well as offering emotionally demarcated tracks, such as the love theme with Marion and the most oppressive and heavy orchestra to portray the Nazis. Another work of genius, for a change.Being an example of the 80s, and literally beginning the decade, the overwhelming majority of the special effects of Hunters are done in a practical way, being done in the studio, unlike the digital effects so common today. It is very good that Spielberg did not like his friend George Lucas who adapted the effects of Star Wars for the ""current times"" which would be to deny the nature of the film and the time in which it was made. The snake scene was made with real snakes (and that scene with a cobra was filmed with a cobra between a glass panel and the actor. The giant ball at the beginning is actually a giant ball, and the scene where Indiana Jones is dragged by a car was filmed that way, with some stuntmen obviously, but Harrison Ford himself was dragged by the car at one point. We have rubber dolls and animatronics to serve as the dead henchmen, while the need for a more supernatural practically takes the film on a path of trash terror. Anyone who watched the film as a child is forever scarred by the images of Nazis having their faces twisted, exploded and melted when the Ark demonstrates the magnitude and horror of its power, and Spielberg and his team have fun here. Okay, the matte paintings and projections of the ""spirits"" of the Ark are images that today appear considerably dated, but still have an impact, as well as the wonderful eighth of the Nazi Ernst Toht (Ronald Lacey) literally melting before our eyes.One of the great films of Spielberg's career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time. The film, despite being a big blockbuster, still has personal traits of the director who is Jewish, so don't think that the Nazis are villains by chance. Spielberg prints in Caçadores gains a strong and constant critical sub-text that enriches the cinematographic experience, combining narrative lightness with very strong ""strikes"" against the most murderous regime of the 20th century. It is almost like a form of indoctrination in which a certain political position was instilled in the subconscious without our realizing it.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" borders on perfection, as it shows that the academic or scientific search can evidently solve some mysteries, while so many others are apparently instituted to be solved with time and investigations that will last for the lives and generations of many scholars, and this feeling gains even more strength with the scene that precedes the credits, where you see a shed with numerous artifacts kept, all waiting to star in one or more adventures of Indiana and yours.With all these elements well balanced - including a predilection for fantasy - ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"" became one of the biggest commercial successes in cinema history, competing for eight Oscars and taking four, starting a millionaire franchise and also generating several imitations. We witnessed a perfect adventure film here, being one of the most dignified and perfect examples that the genre has ever seen. Indiana Jones is already born an iconic figure, thanks to the good ideas of George Lucas and the technical virtuosity of Steven Spielberg, who delivers his first great action film in a fun and intelligent way, using the nostalgia of a very specific period to create something completely new.",False
2,9,When Harrison Ford was crapping gold,acedj,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the first movie in the Indiana Jones series. It is also the best film in the series. Indy is hired by the US government to track down the sacred arc of the covenant. While he is on his quest the Nazis are also searching for the arc. This is a wonderful adventure story that covers many countries. Harrison Ford was born to play this role, and he does it with flair. After having seen this film quite a few times, you also get to pick out the Easter eggs that are scattered around. One hint is be on the lookout for two well known Star Wars droids.
I do not think that there was a better combination in the 80's than Lucas and Spielberg. This in everything you would want from an adventure movie and more.",False
3,9,Will stand the test of time forever.,CuriosityKilledShawn,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and big screen. My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available! I can't think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release. There's just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930's serials, Tom Selleck or the sword/gun fight.I will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it's the other way around? Well, no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey and Donald in Carl Bank's Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you'll surely notice the similarities.The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.The action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he's a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.You might think that it's rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of 'Indy' signature sound to them, that I've not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William's classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars!I'm not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there's already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There's talk of a fourth movie at the moment, but I personally don't think it will happen and I don't want it to. It's perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there's the Young Indiana Jones TV show (where are the DVDs?), which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).I am giving Raiders 9/10 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 10/10 movie). Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?",False
4,10,A blockbuster how it was meant to be,belzebuebchen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can be. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary. In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.Of course the story isn't waterproof, the Nazi weren't that present in Egypt in 1936 and how did Indy survive that ride on the submarine again? But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is.Spielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic. With their attempt to make an homage to adventure comics of the 1930's they created their own legend.It's funny, exiting, thrilling and romantic. What more can you ask for?",False
5,10,One if not the Greatest Action Adventure Movie Ever,shanrock-33046,n/a,15/08/2025,"From an Amazing cast that give you a great story of the old fashion action, adventure, love, comedy plot. It is a good movie with great photography. This is a movie that you will surely not want to ever miss.",False
6,10,There will never be another film like Raiders,baumer,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o'clock shadow looking like it's closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!Whhhoooooo!! I'm left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.Indiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today's terms.Raiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy's battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. "" Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. "" ( a battered and bloody Indy ) "" Truck? What truck?"" ( and then later ) ""Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar's. I'm going after that truck. ""Sola ) "" How? "" ( Indy ) I don't know I'm making this up as I go.""Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven't seen this movie in a while or if you haven't seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.TRUST ME",False
7,10,What movies should be.,mthompson1450,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolute perfection from start to finish,pulls you in and doesn't let you go til it's over.. in my top 5 movies of all time.",False
8,10,Just perfect,iggy-92588,n/a,15/08/2025,Simply the best adventure/action movie of all time. Have nothing to say But perfect. Exiting and amazing through out the whole movie. Harrison Ford plays the role Indiana Jones amazingly. George Lucas and steven Spielberg did an amazing job as well and for me this is the best movie out of the whole Indiana Jones trilogi.,False
9,10,Excellent movie and brilliantly crafted entertainment with a superb casting,PyrolyticCarbon,n/a,15/08/2025,"I remember seeing this movie when I was young, and it may well have been in the cinema with my Father, I can't quite remember (if he does, then please post the answer), anyway I do remember seeing it and being thoroughly entertained and that feeling of excitement and total fun staying with me to this very day as that is the feeling that the movie conjures up whenever I think of it.I think a part of that is down to the fact it's a complete retake on the old serial movies combined with obvious comic book style, and that is just perfect for kids and appeals to them no end, or rather it did then! So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy, and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy, Raiders of the lost Ark.It was just as I remembered, fun, excitement, wise cracks, a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow, and lots of stunts and action. It's a superb movie and captures that style of serials, adventure stories and comic books perfectly, how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn't alive during those times.The set pieces are fantastic, and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now, it hasn't lost the excitement factor. It's a perfectly crafted movie as well, moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes, it just feels like it's all there for a reason and that it belongs there.Harrison Ford is excellent in the role, and I'm inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo, but that's a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays, now he belongs to the moody, quiet school of acting, then he was dynamic, adventurous, strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore (where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas?), and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it's a ripping adventure yarn, you don't need depth. Saving the Ark from the Nazi's, surely that's enough! An excellent movie and great fun too, without a doubt one of my favourite of all time.",False
10,7,Conception of a Series.,rmax304823,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOriginal, exciting, and lots of fun. Spielberg directed it and Kasdan and Lucas wrote it. Without it, we wouldn't have had ""Romancing the Stone"", ""The Jewel of the Nile,"" ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Empire"", and many others too numerous to list. They were all more or less rip offs of this one. Of course the original was highly successful. I dragged my lugubrious ex to the theater and even SHE enjoyed it. For a while there was an attempt to merchandise Indiana Jones' leather jackets, fedoras, and bull whips but they didn't get far.The fact that this was such a commercial blockbuster raised the inevitable question, which may be roughly phrased as, ""What do I do NOW, Ma?"" What you do is produce sequels: ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Amazon Women of the Moon,"" and so on. Each imitation, each sequel, was less innovative and more desperate and sloppy, but that's in the nature of decadence.Harrison Ford, whose career this put the stamp of approval on, is an archaeologist who is recruited to find the Ark of the Covenant hidden somewhere in the Middle East. It's 1936 and the Nazis are after it and who knows what havoc they might wreak with its powers? Jones drags along Karen Allen, a former lover and assistant, to provide a pulchritudinous sidekick with whom he can exchange insults. Anything resembling sex is out of the question, though, just as it would never have been considered in one of the 1930s Saturday afternoon theater serials on which this kind of story is based.Here's the schematic diagram of the plot: Introduction, suspense, action, suspense, action, suspense . . . n. Then the climax -- a really BIG action scene.But the thing that made it successful and keeps it so enjoyable after thirty years is that the action wasn't of the usual sort. Oh, sure, Jones and his girl friend are threatened with immanent death lots of times -- involved in comic fist fights, shot at with poisoned arrows. That's de rigeur. But how often does a hero find himself dashing through an underground tunnel downhill pursued by a three-ton rolling marble? Another element that contributed to its appeal was its reconstruction of the period, 1936. The exotic settings of 1936 aren't just rebuilt. They're lovingly reproduced. The ordinary set dressings are there to suggest the exotic -- always look for beaded curtains -- but the men don't waltz around in immaculate double-breasted white suits and pith helmets. The settings are overblown, to be sure. I strongly doubt that in all of Nepal there was a saloon with the size and atmosphere of Karen Allen's. I'm not at all sure there were ANY saloons in Nepal in 1936. But they're meant to suggest authenticity, not embody it, and they succeed in an creative way.Finally, the characters are kind of enjoyable in themselves, from the often frightened and only barely willing Indiana Jones himself, through the cartoon Nazis with the monocles and Swastika armbands. Oh, boy, watch the ark of the covenant MELT them down to nothing while they are frozen in place and screaming! The force unleashed.",True
11,10,Great great great Movie!,jandrfilms,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLoved the whole concept, it took me a minute to realize that the movie was set in the early 1940's, yeah I know, I'm a bit slow, but eventually I did catch on to what was going on.Harrison Ford did an outstanding performance as Indiana Jones in search of the Lost Ark. Loved the action packed scene, especially when he took the statue off of the mantel and that huge stone began to roll chasing him out of the cave. The movie had a lot of twist and turns and the comedy scenes were great even though I don't believe that it was intended to be funny, but it added more of a flavor to the movie. A must watch if you're into this kind of things about history, which I am.",True
12,6,cartoon for grownups?,xenophil,n/a,15/08/2025,"Everyone else seems to love this movie, so I guess I have to be the one to 'dis' it.  I really don't understand why it is so popular.   I really enjoy a good adventure, but I like it to be more than a quarter inch deep.It was so continuously noisy that I had to turn the volume down.   The music was bombastic and grating.  People die like flies.  The protagonists gaily wreak havoc with no apologies.  There is no psychology or character.  The hero is brave - a cheap virtue since he's obviously invulnerable.   The cultural icons dragged in to lend an exotic tone were given the most superficial treatment - everything was a throwaway, but none of it was stylish, witty or funny.  We are talking about a cartoon - except lots of cartoons are more sophisticated and better developed.I can see that the idea is to evoke a golden age of imperialism where we are excused from the duty to care about history, culture and religion, or to feel bad about archaeological piracy, mass murder, ethnic stereotypes, shoddy scholarship, etc. etc. and can just have some good clean fun.  But with all this freedom, what is the fun?   Knocking over piles of blocks like a three-year-old and punching the bad guy in the nose.The movie is a pastiche - almost every scene is borrowed.  The cultural vein of nostalgia that is being mined is old -obsolete - adventure fiction. If we could see most of this fiction now we would probably find it childish and dated - we know more about the world now.  The trick is to make us forget that so we can enjoy our nostalgia.Do people really need permission to regress this badly?",False
13,n/a,"A wonderful movie, but I still prefer The Last Crusade.",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rating: **** out of ****There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie series in the history of cinema. And the one start it all was Raiders of the Lost Ark, a fast-paced adventure packed with one death-defying cliff-hanger situation after another. To this day, Raiders remains one of the best action movies, holding up better than most of today's rapid-cut, MTV-style ""thrill rides."" Raiders relied on no CGI, no flashy editing, just pure, exhilarating film-making and storytelling, a combo of its kind that has only been surpassed by its second sequel, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Harrison Ford stars as Jones, an archaeologist who dresses in a brown coat and fedora, armed with a revolver and lion-taming whip. A delightful opening involving elaborate booby traps informs us he's used to these adventures (especially his even closer brushes with death in Temple of Doom, which was a prequel). When he returns to the states from his latest ""excavation,"" he's informed by the military that the Nazis are after the ark of the covenant, an artifact that could possess the power to make the Nazis an invincible army. So Jones sets out to retrieve the ark first, in what will prove to be one of his greatest adventures.There's probably little doubt that Raiders is the fan/critical favorite of the trilogy, but there are a few things that I actually have to gripe about, blasphemous as it may be. For one, even though the story is excellent, it's not without its holes. Most perplexing is in the film's opening scenes, when we wonder why Jones bothered to bring along potentially traitorous porters when it's such a short distance from the river to the cave temple. Also (spoilers), one needs only to see the film once to realize that if Indy had never tried to intercept the Ark, the Nazis would a) have never found it or b) still would have suffered the same horrible fate regardless.The action sequences are superb, though an early bar shootout isn't quite as adrenaline-pumping as it could be and looks quite bland compared to the film's other action scenes. Thankfully, the following street chase is playful and exciting and keeps the joyous momentum flowing. Overall, I'd still argue that both Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade boast more inventive action but there's no questioning that the action scenes in Raiders are fantastic and likely superior to any film you may have seen the last few years.As bitchy as I may sound, I'm not trying to harp on Raiders, at least not too much. The movie does feature the famous (and deservedly so) truck chase, one of the most unbelievably thrilling and exhilarating action setpieces I've ever seen (and given an extra boost by John Williams' beautifully rousing score). To this day, even with the recent chase scenes in The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3, this sequence has yet to be surpassed.Other standout sequences include a sarcophagus almost entirely decorated with snakes, imposing statues, and well-preserved mummies, and Jones' mano-a-mano battle with a seemingly impervious Nazi mechanic. The finale takes the film dangerously close to the horror genre, climaxing things with a truly memorable (and quite frightening) light show for the ages. Every Indiana Jones film has a scene that scarred me as a kid and I think every one who's seen Raiders knows what I'm referring to (as well as its sequels)I've said it before, Harrison Ford is wonderful as Jones, embodying a hero that's cool beyond words, yet still entirely human and believable. The supporting cast isn't as up to par: Paul Freeman makes for a decent but not particularly menacing villain as Belloq and Karen Allen is somewhat annoying as Indy's love interest, but there are an equal share in gems, particularly Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah (The Last Crusade wisely gave these actors/characters more screen time).Raiders of the Lost Ark was revolutionary cinema, paving way for summer blockbusters that would attempt for the same winning mix of thrills and humor. Only its sequels matched and/or surpassed it, but some have actually come close (The Mummy). If you haven't seen Raiders yet, put it on the top of your list.",False
14,5,Proof that people care more about nostolgia....,williamrbabcock,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThen they do about an actual good movie. This movie is not good, at least not anymore. I saw this, and the subsequent sequels, in the movie theatre as a kid. I quite enjoyed it. Action, adventure, super-natural elements. It had it all...that is until I watched it again as an adult. It still has action, adventure, and super-natural elements, but what it doesn't have is a good script, good acting, good editing, and good flow. My God, the way this movie jumps around is insane. Characters like Sallah had no introduction. None of the characters had an ""arc"", which is fine by me as I don't think it's a necessity, but they had no depth, which is hard to get past. People complain about movies like John Wick being unbelievable because he gets beat-up, shot, etc., but the same thing happens to Indy. Over and over.I know some people find the introduction of Marion and her line ""I was a child"" a little ""rapey"", but it was a movie made in 1981 set in 1939. Back then, it wasn't that rapey. That's not what bothered me. What was is that she makes a huge fuss about how it's her bar and she worked hard to make it, etc., and when it burns down she's just like, whatever. I'm your shadow now.And then when Indy thinks she's dead when the truck just rolls over and explodes (uh, what?), it cuts to Indy drinking with the monkey. The evil monkey that turned her in. Again, what?And then Indy and Sallah just walk all around the Nazi dig site and no one questions them? Even when they find the right place and a crew goes up there and digs, in plain sight, and no one questions them? And then the temple with the snakes. This is supposed to be a temple sealed for like 2000 years, yet somehow all these snakes are surviving? And coming out of a wall? What?Ok, then they get on a boat and a Nazi submarine finds them. Indy hides in a pipe. Then cut to him climbing onto the sub. The sub submerges and travels by map to some Nazi island only to show Indy already out of the water up high? What? Did the sub not go under water? Seems unlikely. Just too convenient.And then the ending is just awful. I thought it was cool as a kid, faces melting, yay, but it just kind of negates Indy's journey. He didn't do anything to win other than close his eyes. What a cop out. Also, how did he know ""not to look""? Again, convince.I am 47 and looking at this movie again through the lenses and mind of a 47 y/o there were parts that were still enjoyable, but the overall whole of the movie does not stand the test of time.And the irony is I see peole complaining about current movies that suffer from the same issues this movie does, giving them a 1 star rating, yet still give this movie a 10.Like I said, nostolgia holds more importance than an actual good film.",True
15,10,One of the best action movies ever made.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"There is no denying, that this film will forever be one of the greatest movies in the action/adventure genre. Ahead of watching the newest Indie movie, I decided to go straight back to the first one, it's been some time since I last saw it, but it is as still fresh, exciting and downright fun as I remember.The plot is pretty wild, to reach the prized artefact, Indie has to battle through all manner of dangers, battling Nazis in the process, it sounds outlandish and outrageous, but it works.I'd still regard it as Harrison Ford's defining role, he is a huge character, Indie is a real free spirit, he's funny, daring, charming and captivating, the eternal adventurer, perhaps the reason he's back forty years on.Raiders of The Lost Ark is the first of the Indiana Jones, and arguably the best, although I also love Temple of Doom.The perfect film for a bank holiday evening, or teatime on boxing day, it's an adventure that has something for the whole family.Expect some amazing action sequences, this has some impressive fight sequences, explosions, chases, it really is a visual feast, I'm so glad it was made before cinema was captured by The CGI wizards (not that I'm taking away from what those guys do,) but the action feels real.Four decades on, and it's still an exciting, action packed thrill ride, but then you know that already.10/10.",False
16,10,THE BEST OF THE VERY BEST,donaldsonramsay,n/a,15/08/2025,It's odd to think that Tom Selleck was the first choice to play Dr Jones. I doubt he'd have brought Harrison Ford's world weariness that I love to the role. Often imitated never bettered I never tire of watching this movie.,False
17,10,Classic and timeless action adventure,snoozejonc,n/a,15/08/2025,"Archaeologist-Adventurer Indiana Jones hunts for the ancient Ark of the Covenant.This movie is a spectacular introduction to one of the most iconic action heroes of twentieth century cinema. It has one of the greatest opening sequences of all time and follows it up with a plethora of classic cinematic moments.We have a McGuffin based plot moving through a variety of locations, encountering a rival archaeologist and hordes of Nazis hell bent on eliminating Indy and taking the Ark for themselves.Harrison Ford is a mixture of Bond and Bogart with his expressive face and rugged charm, while Karen Allen makes a combative and confrontational leading lady. ""You b*****ds! I'll get you for this"" Marion shouts at an entire platoon of Nazis. The two display excellent screen chemistry. One great aspect is the change in attitude we see from Indy towards Marion as the film progresses. Initially it's all about the Ark but by the end it's a bit more about her. Perhaps this is what saves him from the same fate as the film's antagonists.Visually it has the feel of classics like Casablanca, Citizen Kane and Yojimbo. Spielberg has also borrowed and updated action sequences from the likes of Zorro and Stagecoach to great effect. Particularly impressive are the use of shadows in several sequences, my favourite being when the Ark is first carried out of its burial site. All of it is edited so that the noisey excitement is complimented by quieter moments that are just as memorable.Spielberg's anger towards the Nazis rises to the surface in one of the film's themes covering good and evil. Images like the burning swastika and the wrath of god witnessed at the film's conclusion are examples of the Ark punishing those who have broken the covenant held within.John Williams gave the film one of his finest scores and it makes every frame that bit more special. Seeing Indy swinging from jungle vines, chasing a truck on horseback and swimming on to a German U-boat would not be the same without that famous tune to give it that air superhuman confidence.This launched a franchise for Lucas and Spielberg but it was never bettered or even equalled by any of the adventures that followed.",False
18,10,Great,0U,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun.",False
19,10,My Favourite Movie Of All Time,lenikut,n/a,15/08/2025,"Raiders of the lost ark is the brainchild of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. It follows the archeolog and a part-time teacher - Indiana Jones and his race against Nazis to find the lost ark.Ok, let's start with the script. It's one of the best i've read. It's really fast paced, engaging, fun and thrilling. Also the story by George Lucas is really freaking good.The directing - there is nothing i can say here that hasn't been said before - it's fantastic!The acting is also wonderful. Evrybody is great, especially Harrison Ford as Indiana jones. I can't imagine anybody else as the cool archeologist who fights Nazis and stuff. Karen Allen is also surprisingly good. That's the first movie i saw her in and i was really surpried.It's not gonna be a descent review without talking about the music by the freaking John Williams. Once again, i can't say poop that hasn't been said before - it's amazing!Overall Raiders of the lost ark is what i love about cinema. It continious to inspire me to this day and that is why it's my favourite movie of all time.",False
20,9,"Harrison Ford, in the role that suited him best...",Nazi_Fighter_David,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ford stars as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist adventurer, who spends his time traveling all over the world through jungles, deserts, oceans, and caverns in search for hidden treasureslike the priceless long-lost Ark of the Covenant (the Hebrew sacred artifact that held the supposed Ten Commandments). Unfortunately, a group of treasure-hungry Nazis wants it too, having heard that any army who wins it would receive supernatural powersWith his trademark hat, whip, leather jacket, and pistol for backup, our stubborn, intelligent, determined and loyal hero escapes innumerable dangers, evades multiple obstacles including fearsome thugs in a busy Cairo bazaar, and hangs underneath a fast-moving truck in an exciting chase through a road These are only some of the film's incredible set pieces Steven Spielberg likable hero is not invincible, though, facing impossible odds, capable of getting beaten, struck violently, heart broken, and falling asleep after the first kissThe villainsespecially Indy's suave and cultured French rival wearing a Panama hat and white suits, Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman)are not really that much different from him, except in their motivation The shrill heroine, Marion (Karen Allen)is not the girl always in discomfort either, but a resourceful, dynamic and formidable woman who doesn't require the hero at all""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" is a perfect package of unforgettable scenes, countless action, humor, astonishing technical effects, thrilling sequences, and terrific performances It was followed by three fun sequels",False
21,7,"A good film, but nothing more",r96sk,n/a,15/08/2025,"'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a good film, but nothing more than that for me.Harrison Ford does a sterling job as Indiana Jones, even if his performance does constantly remind me of Steve Martin for some reason. John Rhys-Davies, who I like in James Bond's 'The Living Daylights', fits in well as Sallah. Apart from those two, I don't think any of the others have anything major/memorable about them here - I would've liked to have seen more of Ronald Lacey's Toht.The adventure side is enjoyable, though everything else is missing a spark in my opinion; a lot of the plot devices are convenient and predictable. The special effects are solid though, as is the score by John Williams.It makes for a fun enough watch, even if I did expect better.",False

If not, see it now.I love going to movies. I always have. I remember when this film came out. My friends had seen it before I had. They boasted it was great, the best film ever. Some even said it was better than Star Wars (utter blasphemy to a devout 10 year old Jedi-wannabe). I thought no way is this film better than Star Wars, but I was still curious and began the begging of my father to take me.When I was young, almost all of the films that I had seen, I saw with my Dad. He would take me and my mother would stay at home with my siblings. We saw a number of films that failed to generate a reaction with him as they did with me, but this one was different. This one, my Dad might've enjoyed just as much.Who can forget the scene where Indy faces bandits in the marketplace, fighting swords with his wits and fists, only to be finally challenged by a dark robed adversary brandishing a heavy, dismembering type of sabre as he swings the impressive blade about his head menacingly?Indiana looks his opponent up and down briefly and draws his pistol casually and shoots the villain dead as if his patience had been tested a moment longer than he could tolerate.My father, and the entire audience for that matter, laughed and cheered at this incredible scene. And it was the first time I'd actually been aware of his enjoyment of the film. Usually I'm so transfixed that I wouldn't notice if my legs were on fire. He enjoyed it so much, that he still tends to bring up that scene, even today.My father and I shared a great moment in movie history, and I will never forget it for as long as I live. I will always be grateful for the time we spent together and the films that I otherwise would have been unable to see without him taking me.Just a side note about the scene I've described above. It wasn't meant to go that  way at all. As Steven Spielberg explained in a television interview, the scene was meant to have an elaborate fight sequence, but Harrison Ford was suffering from diarrhea and couldn't go through with the elaborate set-up required. Someone said, ""the only way we can finish this scene today is if he shoots him"". Steven said, ""Wait a minute, we might have something there.""As for where it ranks with Star Wars, it's hard for me to say, so I won't. Star Wars was the first film I ever saw, and there's a story in that as well. Thanks again, Dad.",False
23,n/a,Classic bit of schoolboy action,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"In the run up to WW2 Professor Jones is approached by US Intelligence to recover the lost Ark of the Covenant in order to stop it falling into the hands of the Nazi's.  With bar owner Marion in tow, Indiana takes on Nazi's across the globe to recover the ark.The story is pure Saturday morning hokum, but its all shined up with a great deal of professionalism and you don't notice.  The main strength is the tremendous sense of fun in the film - not only is it funny but the huge action scenes are all edge of the seat stuff that are hugely enjoyable to watch.  Be it the opening set piece, the truck chase, the fight around a burning airplane, the chase for a basket or the gory finish - it's all great fun to watch.The performances are pretty cardboard and stereotype - evil Nazi's et al. but it barely matters.  Ford is great - this is the type of undemanding hero type that he thrives on.  The rest of the cast are good - Freeman and Kahler stand out with their characters.  If it has any weaknesses then the lack of characterisation and plotting are the main suspects but I really think the flaws are greatly outweighed by strengths.Overall a good action film for older families.  With an old fashioned feel, a great sense of fun, plenty of laughs and fantastic action scenes this deserves all the good reviews it gets.",False
24,7,"I'm no longer the target audience for this film, but still solid.",SpelingError,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before I start, I might as well address the ""sleeping with underage women"" bit which has gotten some controversy in the past few years. After watching Jones' and Marion's first scene together, I definitely raised an eyebrow at the ""You knew what you were doing"" conversation, and after reading the transcript where Spielberg and Lucas intended for Marion to be 15 and for Jones to be 25 when they had their affair, that aspect of the film stuck out as problematic. Due to that (in addition to Jones being a colonist), I wasn't able to get invested in their friendship and eventual romance. If Jones' arc was of him redeeming himself throughout the film, that would be different, but he instead seemed to be portrayed as noble and charming all throughout.So yeah, couldn't get invested in the characters this viewing. In spite of that, however, I still think this is a solid action film. It has some memorable action scenes (the opening), a couple terrific magical scenes (the God's wrath scene at the end is outstanding, in particular), and its fair share of humor here and there (Jones shooting the swordsman). Back when I was a kid, this film was everything for me. When I rewatched it a couple days ago, however, I found that the love I felt towards the film when I was a kid wore off. This isn't to say the film aged poorly per se (rather, I think the film aged great for the most part). It's just not my kind of film anymore and I'm no longer the target audience for it. Since I've watched a number of films like Battleship Potemkin, Zulu, The Wild Bunch, Apocalypse Now, Hard-Boiled, Saving Private Ryan, etc since then, which have action scenes that are far more engaging and technically outstanding, that may play a part in why my tastes have moved on. Who knows. Still though, I think this is a great gateway film and it would definitely be among my top recommendations for someone new to classic film.",False
25,5,The mother of countless silly action movies,dierregi,n/a,15/08/2025,"Since everybody knows what this movie is about, mine will be a review of the strongest and weakest points. At the time of release, this seemed a brand new approach to storytelling. I am not surprised it was a big success: Harrison Ford was smoldering hot and the supporting cast was great, with a special mention to John Rhys-Davies.With the passing of time and repeated views, I find the following weaknesses, common to many Spielberg (and action) movies:the overbearing soundtrack. I know many love it, I cannot stand it anymore. During the truck chase scene, there is nothing but the loud orchestra score booming ceaselessly, while Indy gets beaten but bounces back like a rubber manthe thin plot. The search for the Ark is just an excuse to create one action scene after the other. They increase in violence and implausibility, until the last one, possibly the silliest of the moviethe last ""action scene"". The ritual proposed by Belloq serves no purpose, apart from providing a bombastic ending to Indy's troubles. Anyway, it is unbelievable to imagine that Nazi troops would indulge the request of the French archaeologistthe ""super hero"" nature of Indy. Despite the premise that he is a ""normal"" guy, Indy is shown to suffer only slightly from inhuman beatingsall the sequels. None managed to reach even half-way the level of ""Raiders"" and considering this one already had its flaws.On the plus side:there are some moments of humour, unfortunately not enough. The best is the famous scene of Indy shooting the huge, menacing black-clad guy in the market. For one precious scene like this, we have the long and pointless fight with the German guarding the plane, back to conventional narrativean attractive hero with some intellectual pretense. Indy is supposed to be a beauty with a brain, contrary to way too many superheroes who are infesting the silver screen (even more so nowadays)the ironic endingConclusion: what seemed an innocuous narrative that looked back to the old serial movies of the past, turned into a monster that spawned endless sequels and imitators, creating the action-without-soul blockbusters plaguing more than ever contemporary cinema.",False

1,8,Here we go...,Stewatson35,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is my hometown.To my shame, I was an active heroin addict during this time and longer.Jade who keeps popping up, the one with 1 tooth.Yeah, I'm not a fan!She tried to give talks about being clean from heroin. Then she disappeared for about 2 months and was found smacked out of her mind.Out of all the prostitutes, Jade always managed to hunt down the press first! (Because the press were giving them 20 quid for the info. First bag of gear.)Also at that time, I was in Iceni drug rehab.These prostitutes were taking advantage of somebody's goodwill.They'd left money there in case a prostitute needs it.And EVERYDAY, we watched the same giggling girls walk in and say ""I need a new washing machine!""
Isn't that the third washing machine she's bought this week???So they were given free money, then still went on the streets.People seem to think they took that money and bought a washing machine.No, they spend it on drugs. These girls would do anything to bleed you of some money. But they didn't deserve to die.But Jade walking about like the killer would have ever chosen her!I know for a fact he went for good looking girls sadly.I'm sorry, I don't like Jade as a person.Factually she was right. But nobody wanted to stand with Jade because nobody is going to want to pay money to get busy with Jade.I went to a meeting about the new rehab in Ipswich.Couldn't get a word in, because lying one-tooth Jade was high on heroin, and she was talking for the whole of Ipswich! So we left.Shortly after that ""clean Girl in Cupboard"" - see, she's done so well for herself by being a prostitute. She's had 1 TV show made about her. She made the other murders about her: ""I was just with her! That could have been me!"" No it couldn't!My own personal dislike for the lies that poured freely from her mouth.Which is why I don't believe a word she'll ever say.Yes, she was a prostitute.I don't know how many times she had to perform that act.Not many!",False
2,6,Average viewing,stuart_jarman,n/a,16/08/2025,This is good to hear more about the victims and their stories as often they get lost or are never told.Shame they felt the need to use Parm Sandu as some sort of expert when she knows very little and was not even working in murder investigations or in this area. Strange choice who detracts from the real stories.I would recommend watching this although it would be better if focussed a little more on local police who worked the case as they have done with local news reporters. It is an interesting story and with the murderer about to go on trial for another murder it is possibly quite well timed.,False
3,4,Boring,accfews-592-813153,n/a,16/08/2025,"When it comes to stories about serial killers, people often expect an intense, adrenaline-pumping thrill ride. However, there are times when a story that's supposed to be gripping can actually end up being quite dull and slow-paced.Unfortunately, that's the case with this particular story. Despite its intriguing premise, the tale is lacking in many ways. One of the main issues is the repeating dialogues, which can become tiresome after a while. In addition, the story's progression is quite slow, which can make it difficult to stay engaged.To be honest, there were moments when I felt like giving up on the story entirely. It just didn't seem worth the effort to keep reading. I even considered turning to Wikipedia to read a summary instead.Perhaps one of the biggest issues with this story is that it doesn't seem to respect the reader's time. There's simply too much unnecessary detail and too little actual plot development. If the author had trimmed down the story and focused on the most important aspects, it could have been much more effective.Another problem is that the story fails to deliver on its promise of being a thrilling tale of murder and suspense. Instead, it plods along slowly, without much tension or excitement. It's a shame, because the story had the potential to be really interesting.In the end, I think this story could have been condensed into a 60-70 minute episode, and everyone would have been much happier. As it stands, it's a slow, laborious read that just isn't worth the effort. If you're looking for a gripping serial killer story, this one is best left on the shelf.",False

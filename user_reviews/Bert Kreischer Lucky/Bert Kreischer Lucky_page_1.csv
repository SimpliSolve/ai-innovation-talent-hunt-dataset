1,5,Ya got too famous,jwassdesign,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThere comes a time in every successful comedians career where their set becomes out of touch. We love comedians because they feel like US. After years of hard work and fame and getting fit and maybe some therapy---the comedy changes. The topics turn to airport talk, food talk, places you've traveled while on tour, that-one-thing-that-one-person-said-when-you-said-that-joke-last time, and lastly, the celebrities they know that are their friends now.I chose to turn the special off after it was mentioned $2K+ was dropped on big boy cones and his daughter didn't understand the value of a $1. It was clear the standard celebrity encounter was on the way. Bert is just famous now and can talk about whatever he wants and people have signed up. Ya know, good for you Bert. But don't forget to be a person.",True
2,5,Rough,nipapp,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've always been a fan of Bert. I have even seen him live, and have cried from laughter by the end of his set. I usually like his work but this one in particular was brutal. Talking about masturbating during a set is funny the first 3 times you do it, but by the 40th, it's just plain stupid. I feel like he's failing to evolve as a comedian. I don't mind the frat boy act and crudeness at all, but the jokes aren't hitting like they used to. I've also heard him on podcasts lately and seen him during the Super Bowl doing media work, and it's been pretty awkward. I really hope his future work is better.",False
3,10,Laugh,tinamariewallace,n/a,15/08/2025,"I will preface this review by saying I am a fan. Put this show on thinking I could have it on just as background noise. I was continuously laughing.I loved it all. Will probably watch again.If you're not a fan, obviously this isn't for you but if. You like him at all. I think you will find this hilarious. I guess now I have to keep talking to make my minimum characters. Not much else else to say actually. I really like Bert Kreischer. I have to listen to the podcast. Next time I'm planning on watching his movie.. Maybe I'll go do that right now. What else can I say. Really enjoyed that comedy special.",False
4,4,Frat humour from a man in his early 50's,paulcassidy-11094,n/a,15/08/2025,"Can't claim to be a Bert fan, just feel he probably should have aged out of this kind of comedy by now. It seems to be negatively impacting how he's perceived when he goes on podcasts (which I assume is a major channel to sell tickets for his shows.) The Two bears show is better when he's not there, and it looks like his Sober October group podcast has been discontinued.I get the sense with Bert that his aim is to get a reality tv show similar to that of the Osbornes, with the focus of 'hilarious' things that happen in his domestic life.The dog joke at the end was probably the joke of the set, but the punchline is super obvious.On the plus side, it's better than Rogan & Bapa's last specials.",False
5,9,Hilarious,Bmore-Hero,n/a,15/08/2025,"Bert Kreischer's ""Lucky"" is a masterclass in stand-up comedy that finds a rare balance between outrageous humor and heartfelt storytelling. Kreischer's effortless charm and infectious energy light up the stage as he dives into personal anecdotes, making even his most absurd tales feel deeply relatable. His storytelling is punctuated by impeccable timing and a fearless willingness to embrace life's unpredictable twists, earning genuine laughs and moments of surprising introspection.The production is polished without feeling overproduced, allowing Kreischer's natural charisma to shine through. The intimate setting draws you in as if you're right there in the crowd, sharing in the hilarity and warmth of his performance. ""Lucky"" stands out not just for its belly laughs but also for its honest reflections on the ups and downs of life, making it a refreshing departure from typical stand-up routines.While a couple of jokes may not land for every viewer, the overall experience is so engaging and spirited that it earns a solid 9 out of 10 stars. ""Lucky"" is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates comedy that's both smart and unapologetically fun.",False
6,2,Lost the plot.....,sonjamin,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ok, his shtick is getting really old. Yes, he has his go to ""Machine"" bit, the movie was miserable and not enjoyable, but that it. Unlike his podcast partner Tom S and most other powerful and success comdians, who evolve and have developed new material, Bert just falls to the same stuff (his frat days, what a great athlete was/is, blah blah blah). Delivery is the same, the bits are pretty much the same. Do we really need you to rip off your shirt every single performance? Yes, some chuckles here and there, but for the most part it was pretty boring. Would love to see him venture out and push his boundaries a bit. Push the envelop and give us something new and refreshing.",False
7,9,Bert Krescher: Lucky,IceCream-57,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was the first time that I have seen Bert's work and I honestly enjoyed it greatly. But it doesn't not seem like I was the only one that did. It seems like most people that watched this that have followed his work was not as impressed as they normally are with his work. I enjoyed it. At first when I turn this on to watch on Netflix, I couldn't believe that he was about to go out there without a shirt on considering his body size. Not bashing, I probably weigh or then him! However he went on stange and in my opinion delivered a good show! Yes there is a argument that maybe he went to far at times with the humor centered around his wife, but it was all jokes and you can tell it's just good humor and that he deeply loves and cares for his family. I enjoyed the show.",False
8,4,Wife's stinky titts? Really?,Ani_,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI read some comments about people laughing hard it makes my head scratch... maybe some teenagers idk. I'm a millennial and this was not funny at all. Him talking about his wife's stinky titts? Really?Some of the jokes about him and his wife were just gross. There is a line you just don't cross. Good amount of cringe material here.Ugh... being generous with 4 stars. The reason why I am getting out of my way to write this to encourage him to come up with something new and stop recycling the same ole jokes.Common ole man, you still got it somewhere... don't disappoint next time. We have faith in you!",True
9,10,AMAZING!!! The Machine still kills in 2025!!,gracecammarano,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some of his best work!! I have been waiting for this set to come out the second Netflix announced it, I cannot wait to see him live!! I mean I was laughing so hard I was crying and almost pissing myself. Bert Kreischer is one of the BEST comedians we have today, truly!! Everything from his bit about Snoop Dogg to his touching yet HILARIOUS Pricilla bit was just top NOTCH! I watch his sketches almost every night because there's nothing more i want to do after a bad day than to have a really good laugh and that's what he does. He delivers every. Single. Time!!!! Once again, the Machine reigns supreme in todays modern comedy scene!",False
10,1,Bert Kreischer's Lucky Proves His Luck Has Run Out,znnkdbnyn,n/a,15/08/2025,"Bert Kreischer has officially run out of things to say. Lucky is not just a bad special-it's a painful, bloated, and desperate attempt to stretch out what little material he has left. If you were hoping for something fresh, clever, or even remotely different from his last few specials, you'll be sorely disappointed. At this point, Bert isn't even trying. He's just coasting on his persona, hoping his obnoxious energy and relentless shirtless gimmick will carry him through another hour. Spoiler alert: it doesn't. The jokes are predictable, drawn out, and lack any real payoff. Instead of well-crafted material, we get exaggerated, drunken rambling and self-indulgent storytelling that feels more suited for a podcast than a stand-up stage. His humor hasn't evolved, and his delivery-full of forced laughter at his own jokes-makes him even more insufferable. Lucky is lazy, unoriginal, and proof that Bert peaked long ago.",False
11,4,Great for teenage boys.,canarsiekid,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have tried so many times to watch him. And when I do watch, I'm in a good mood wanting some comedy. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy this act. If I were a young teenage boy again, I would have most definetly love it.Seems like he's repeating material like Andrew Dice Clay did back in the day. And all the cursing I loved when I was teen. I'm still young at heart at 54 years old, I'm just not into every other word a curse word anymore.Trust me, if I were a teenager he would be on my watch list. Even though they're mostly made up stories, or things he would have liked to have done or said, I just don't see the humor in it.Maybe he could use this review and incorporate it into his material, and somehow manage to make it funny. This is a real review, I'm no hater.I wish him and all reading this the best of luck.",False
12,1,Utterly bad,j_breheny,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was absolutely horrible.I had to watch it twice in order to describe it accurately.He says things for shock value, hoping to get a laugh. The audience is only shown twice, and both times they are shown, there is uproarious laughter, only, no one in the audience is really laughing. The laughter was definitely added in post-production.Like all comedians, he shares stories of his life that are supposed to draw the audience in. The only thing is, the stories are unbelievable and boring.The bit he does about going on a flight with his wife, where he is upgraded to first class, while his wife has to fly coach, is ripped off from a Seinfeld episode. The bit he does about the sometimes malodorousness of women's genitalia, is ripped off from a bit that Martin Short did in ""You So Crazy"", which was filmed thirty-one years ago in 1994.In most of these stories he portrays himself in some form of inebriation, which, I guess, is supposed to make him seem hip.The performance is cringingely disengnouous. He laughs at his own set ups. He pretends to cry during stories of hardships that he faced, only to come out of it two seconds later, indicating that his feelings are just bad acting of a time what he possibly did feel that way.This makes the performance fall utterly flat, and alienates the viewer.I would recommend this to burgeoning comedians who want to see what not to do, when entertaining people .",True
13,1,King of trash. Worst special ever.,imdbfan-4716080363,n/a,15/08/2025,Worst comedy special I've ever seen. Immediately we had to see the shirt come off. His trademark. Something no one wants to see. Then he lights in on his poor wife. I'm sure she endorsed the jokes for the money but they were gross and disrespectful. The only right thing about this garbage was the name. He does admit that he's lucky. And he is. Lucky to have a rich daddy who put him through seven years of undergrad. Lucky to know Tom and Joe and end up on the comedy path while having almost zero talent. Watched it just to see if there were ANY jokes in sight. Nothing but a constant stream of drunken frat toddler stories that would only make a room full of fellow drunks laugh just because of the baudy language and extreme level of gross. Netflix is indeed a joke for airing this trash. Bert needs to hang it up.,False
14,1,A Rough Watch,USGuerrilla,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMy 5 year old nephew comes up with better lies and exaggerations than Bert does. In every story he is the funniest, best, and smartest person in the situation. His vet was crying laughing as he was putting his dog down because of Bert's undeniable hilarity? Sure he was Bert. The sad part is I fully believe he believes that's how it went, because his delusion is beyond comprehension at this point. I bet he told a bad joke, the vet gave a placating chuckle and in Bert's mind it was a massive laugh. Literally every story he tells now is from the POV of a delusional, sad, old drunk. Enough already.",True
15,1,Unbelievable and disingenuous,decfegan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Everything felt made up. I know comedians exaggerate and go over the top. That's not the issue. The issue is, as Bert is cycling through all his stories and feelings and takes... I just don't believe any of it. Added to the fact he has one of 3 shtick's. Being inebriated, being out of touch or being a 60year old frat boy. Like all the stuff about the dog and his wife seemed like an ever weirder attempt to be wholesome. It just came off as desperate and cringe and totally fake. He tries to be everything. A party animal slob that doesn't understand the world or himself one minute to a wholesome, cute and emotionally intelligent dad and savy business operator the next. He just comes across super unlikeable and my read on him is that his comedy or material has no home (other being drunk guy) and will adapt and pander to what he thinks the audience and the culture want to hear.",False

1,8,LAVA LUST,js-66130,n/a,16/08/2025,"Katia, Maurice and the volcano: a fiery menage a trois that will not end well, unless of course, it really is better to burn out than to fade away. For a movie that begins with a startling spoiler (our French lovers succumb to their lust for lava), ""Fire of Love"" spends the entirety of this documentary giddily championing our infectiously doomed couple as they crisscross the globe in search of volcanic activity.Not flighty danger seekers, the Kraffts were dedicated volcanologists and filmmakers who faced danger with acceptance but also with a joie de vivre. Among spectacular in situ footage we are also treated to Maurice peppering the talk show circuit, eagerly detailing their latest escapades with boyish exuberance, some humour, and scientific wonder.This is a man who professed his greatest wish in absolute seriousness was riding a canoe down a river of lava. Instead of shooting down this frivolous dream, Katia notes that it would have to be made of rocketship grade metal. All that is missing is a steady rain of heart emojis throughout the screening. It makes one want to dispatch for the nearest eruption. Almost.This is where film comes in: we can enjoy an exciting, dangerous dance with death, learn a few things, and cherish the power of unbridled love. A raison d'etre shared, is what makes the world go round, or explode.A bientot.HipCRANK.",False
2,8,"Outstanding documentary: ""Curiosity is stronger than fear""",paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Fire of Love"" (2022 release; 93 min) opens, we are introduced to Maurice and Katia Krafft, vulcanologists from France, and we are reminded that the film's footage comes ""from the deep archives of the Kraffts"". We go back in time, as the couple meets in the Alsace region of France and develops a mutual interest and passion in exploring active volcanoes. They document their travels in movies and pictures. At that point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is directed by Sara Dosa (""Tricky Dick & The Man In Black""). The movie consists entirely from the hundreds of hours of footage that the Kraffts recorded during their travels all over the world. This results in the movie being shown in the rather unusual 4:3 film ratio, but let's be clear: this does not affect the movie's top quality at all. The footage is nothing short of stunning, as the couple edges ever closer to active volcanoes. They fully realize the potential dangers of doing so, but as Katia comments: ""Curiosity is stronger than fear"". Elsewhere Maurice comments (I'm paraphrasing): ""If I die tomorrow doing this, it's alright."" The mixture of watching the forces of active volcanoes and the couple's passion for their work (and each other) makes for a dreamy, poetic, and yes, romantic cocktail of life and love.""Love of Fire"" premiered at last year's Sundance Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim. The film is currently rated 99% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason. I am equally 99% certain that this will be nominated for a Best Documentary Oscar. The movie is currently streaming on Hulu, where I caught it the other night. If you are in the mood for an extraordinary nature documentary the likes of which you have never seen before, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.*UPDATE* As I had expected, the movie did get a Best Documentary Oscar nomination, and I'd say it has a decent chance of winning the Oscar, although ""Navalny"" and ""All The Beauty and the Bloosdhed"" (both of which outstanding documentaries in their own right) are also right up there. (My personal prediction is that ""Navalny"" will take the Best Documentary Oscar.)",False
3,7,"Beautiful documentary, but had one flaw I couldn't get past.",gshicks-560-355905,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like so many others have said; this is a wonderfully put together documentary from fragments of the subjects' own footage. The art work that fills in the visual gaps is creative and timeless, but still felt representative of the time periods we were witnessing. It's amazing how much of their lives they were able to put on film. The soundtrack/score was not distracting, which is a good thing IMO, unless it's distracting for a good reason.The most unappealing thing about this film has to be the narrator's voice. It is like a horribly, unattractive spoof of Jena Malone's narration in the film ""Into the Wild"". It felt like it was asking questions when there was no question being asked. The inflections just felt wrong in many parts of the film. That is just one viewer's opinion though.Anyways, definitely worth a watch, but could have been better.",False
4,8,Larva Lovers...,Xstal,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are fuses where their length is undefined, ticking time bombs where the clock faces are blind, explosive discharge they pre-empt, as the earth expels ferment, red or grey, depending how the plates combined. These are landscapes where a couple used to graft, where they practiced, learned, and developed their Krafft, among the pyroclastic flows, volcanoes in their death throes, they enjoyed their time together, life was a blast.A wonderful piece of filmmaking about an eccentric couple who found love among the volatile and explosive environments found in and around the those parts of the world where the planet vents its spleen.",False
5,9,Lava and Love,alexa2022sd,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film tells the story of two scientists who study volcanoes, which leads to their marriage and shared research. The setup might have been too sentimental for my taste but director Sara Dosa sure knows how to tell a story, bringing together amazing archival footage, the most amazing of which features the couple that undertook this dangerous and wonderful work. This was one of the best films at Sundance in 2022.",False
6,6,They sure did love volcanos!,KuroSawWhat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gorgeous volcano footage captured by the subjects of the documentary. But I could really do without the breathy, disinterested female narrator, acting like all life is a passing dream. You don't learn very much about Maurice and Katia's work except that they sure did love volcanos!I ended up having similar feelings with this documentary as I did with ""The Biggest Little Farm"": A film made for California hippies who want to gaze wondrously at nature without actually learning anything.I think that I would be more inclined to seek out the films which Maurice and Katia created themselves, rather than watching this one again. But this is a decent, pretty-looking time killer.",False
7,8,An extraordinary documentary,stylss,n/a,16/08/2025,"Visually stunning, beautiful, awe-inspiring, poetic, and extraordinary documentary featuring tons of lava and a love story that feels like another eccentric Wes Anderson film.

8,7,Voice over gone wrong,sandervanderheide,n/a,16/08/2025,"So first the documentary itself. It's skillfully done and smooth to the end. The pace is perfect and every 10 minutes there are these small intermezzos of fun between Katia and Maurice. In all these short quotes of them, you can sense there commitment to each other and to their work.Speaking about work. Respect for this team. These are all recordings of other people you have to work with and create a story out of all these hours of scenes that look the same but are from different times and different locations.The foley work is a little bit to exaggerated. All these footsteps and noise sounds. You can almost picture someone stepping into some gravel with a microphone next to it.About the voice over. Unbelievable this wasn't redone. It feels like the text was sent to Miranda July without any video material and she recorded everything with her phone in a bedroom. Why Sara Dosa approved this or anyone else, is a mystery. It really makes the film more dull than it really is.",False
9,8,"""Curiosity is stronger than fear"".",TakeTwoReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"Volcanos are fascinating aren't they. Something about things coming up from the depths of the earth. Katia and Maurice Krafft certainly thought so. They are scientists, the outdoor type out in the field exploring in all weather, thankfully with a crew that have cameras to capture the adventures. This is all archive footage. Some very loose, telling the story of the people and some beautifully shot telling the story of the volcanos they study. It's all pulled together with some narration from Miranda July, who certainly adds a romantic hue, but it doesn't feel contrived. Along with snippets of tactile animation, the score and foley work is lovely... and funny, cue Maurice testing Katia's super sci-fi helmet with a rock. There's a lot to love here. Their personalities. The honesty of the footage and how it's cut and of course, the lava flows and eruptions. ""It's so grandiose"". It certainly is. It's exciting. Informative. Dangerous. Entertaining and very quotable, ""Curiosity is stronger than fear"", ""The length of the fuse is never known"". You get a clear sense that this is the documentary they would've made themselves, if they'd had the chance. They're daredevils, well Maurice certainly is. Thinking nothing of taking a dingy out on a lake of concentrated acid. Katia a little less so, but still, this is a dangerous occupation. There's a purity to Fire of Love. A documentary with no agenda. Magnificent.",False
10,6,"Amazing footage, drab storytelling.",ryandgudgeon,n/a,16/08/2025,"The absolutely stunning footage of erupting volcanos are the highlight here in an otherwise lackluster documentary. Fire Of Love can't seem to commit fully to being a nature doc or a love story and thus fails at both. That being said, im not someone who is particularly interested in earth science or volcanology, so im sure that someone who has more interest in these fields might get a little more out of it then I did. IMO, it's worth a view when it comes to Disney+/Nat Geo, but other than that, skip the theater trip.",False
11,8,A really good documentary,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fire of Love is about two people who are married and also happen to be volcanologists, and the life they spent together, filming and photographing volcanoes and all the crazy natural phenomena that comes with them. The film is assembled from the apparently 100s of hours of footage they took, with a few creative liberties taken here and there to fill in some narrative gaps of things they didn't film.It's a simple, touching story that gets very emotional at times. It's also beautiful to look at, with some amazing footage captured by the film's two subjects. Given most of the footage is from the 1970s and 80s, I'm guessing a lot of it's been restored; at least the shots they could. And then even the lower-quality images or damaged pieces of film still provide breathtaking sights. You understand the awe and wonder these two people felt around volcanoes, and similarly, you truly feel how destructive they are. It's also uses music well (including tracks from Brian Eno and Ennio Morricone!)Its simplicity does lead to some scenes feeling repetitive. I'm thankful it was only 97 minutes, because that would have been a bigger problem had it been longer. Also, while some of the editing and scene transitions are great, a few don't flow well. And also, there's a surprising number or volcano eruption jump scares, which I didn't love, but maybe I only jumped a bit because I was sitting near the front of the cinema.Overall, really good, borderline great documentary. Awards shows seem to nominate documentaries randomly, but if they take things seriously this year, Fire of Love should get some nomination love. I doubt there'll be five other 2022 documentaries that are clearly better (okay, the new David Bowie one, Moonage Daydream, might be. Also excited to see that).",False
12,7,A passion for fire,movie-reviews-uk,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's just one star in this fiery documentary. Well actually there are many stars but they are all just one thing: volcanoes. They sprawl across ""Fire of Love"" in all of their dramatic, enigmatic and dynamic glory. If they're not spewing red-hot rivers of lava then they're blowing their top in a world-shaking explosion or sending out a deathly pyroclastic flow.With this backdrop I can very much understand why Maurice and Katia Krafft devoted their lives to vulcanology. The very word conjures up a world where solid ground becomes liquid, inverting our relationship with matter. The documentary does an excellent job of transmitting this fascination despite the lack of any face-to-face interviews.Despite this it's possible to almost understand their shared drive to explore and why they chose this rocky path over all others. They were adventurers in a world where few of us dare to tread and for this they paid the ultimate price.",False
13,5,"Stunning photography, lovely couple, fascinating story, aweful voice over!",miss_pixel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tonight I watched this movie-documentary. I was impressed by the stunning photography and scenery, and was touched by the French couple on their passionate mission to study volcanoes, viewing their own authentic material, gathered through the years. The pieces of film were interconnected by nice graphics which gave a creative but suitable twist to the whole. The music was well chosen. Unfortunately the voice over's voice (Miranda July) was so incredibly bad, dull and depressive and slow, and made the a bit melodramatic texts way too dramatic, it really hits a nerve during the whole movie. Otherwise I would have given 8 stars.",False
14,8,Well crafted archival filmmaking,bdvdvkqcm,n/a,16/08/2025,"The filmmakers have beautifully exploited their access to the trove of archival film that the Kraffts built over decades of work studying volcanoes. This is an editor's film, through and through. The storytelling is a good balance of natural science and human interest, showing the importance of science Maurice and Katia practiced while not shying away from the corrupting influence of the self mythologizing they practiced.The only shortcoming is that the ending is perfunctory relative to the breadth and bounty of the lives profiled. Blink and you'll miss it. Inexplicable, given the power, depth and beauty leading up to this point.",False
15,8,Wonderful and truly Amazing Film.,prberg2,n/a,16/08/2025,I saw some images from this film.. and just went to see it right away. It was really stunning. The story is amazing and I had never heard it before. The images and footage they had in this film was really jaw dropping. Such amazing people and a really great story. Wonderful documentary and film.,False
16,7,"Great Visuals, Touching Story",brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's no telling why two people fall in love. They may be attracted to one another's physical attributes. Or, in some cases, they may be drawn to each other's personalities. Or, in yet other cases, they may share passions that bind them almost as strongly as their mutual affection. In the case of Maurice and Katia Krafft, there was some of all of the above, but what really drove them as a couple was their shared interest in ... vulcanology. Now, the study of volcanoes is not a particularly common interest for anyone, especially for a romantic duo, but, for this happily partnered Alsatian twosome, it was a source of commitment for their life's work and to one another. Director Sara Dosa's latest offering explores the unconventional lives of this quirky, unlikely pair, examining what brought and kept them together for years as they built a solid relationship while compiling an impressive body of work about their field of study. The film consists almost entirely of material from the Kraffts' archives, including media appearances where they discussed their groundbreaking findings and a truly spectacular collection of footage from their globetrotting adventures to investigate volcanic eruptions. The filmmaker meticulously documents the courageous daring with which they approached their work, their fervor for devising safety recommendations for those living in high-risk areas, and the unexpected sense of humor and whimsy with which they often went about their field studies. This Oscar nominee for best documentary feature is indeed an interesting watch, though given the niche nature of its subject matter, it may be a little on the long side for some viewers, even with a runtime of only 1:33.00 (it ultimately may have worked better as an episode of a PBS nature series). Nevertheless, if nothing else, enjoy this one for the stunning natural beauty so vividly on display here, a show better than anything that could be produced with CGI.",False
17,8,Incredibly beautiful,mickeythechamp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Road to the Oscars 2023. This documentary is nominated for 1 award and it´s best documentary. I expected a lot from Fire of Love because everyone told me it was going to be moving and good. I was left a bid disappointed but overall, still moved and in awe. This is one of those documentaries where the footage speaks for itself. It´s beautiful nature pictures that will leave you in awe and asked if it´s manipulated footage. When earth dose something that looks unreal it just makes me think I know nothing and makes me just drop my jaw. The love story is also interesting but didn't leave as impacted as it should.We follow famous volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft. We go through their archived footage and get to see incredible pictures and film of the volcanoes they were examining. We also get to know them the two volcanologist and their relationship and look on life.First of all, this movie is incredibly beautiful. It´s funny the two volcanologists don´t want to call themselves filmmakers course the way the film, show and frame is so beautiful and create these amazing and sometimes unreal images. When nature dose something you're not used to see, it leaves me in absolute awe. Some of the footage looks like it´s not something that actually exists in real life and knowing it´s real and knowing it´s people that risked their lives to capture this is incredible. So much of the footage is so beautiful to me. The colors, movements of lava, the colored clouds of ash it´s all beautiful and look like paintings and things made with computers but it´s real and it´s amazing. The movie simply left me in awe that this exists, and it made me feel as small as intended. After watching you´ll feel like you know nothing about the earth you live on and that natures powers are grander than ever.The couple of Katia and Maurice is an odd one. They are so dedicated to do what they do and see them risk life and each other with every shot is so nerve racking. Knowing what I´m seeing is real people doesn't register sometimes, simply because what they are doing is so life defying. Seeing them standing next to an active volcano crater gives me anxiety and these two are so fascinating to watch, but so unrelatable because of how insane they are. But they are insane in a good way, they are fascinating human beings that found their call in life and ran with it. It´s interesting to hear their world views and their dedication. I feel like the love story takes a back seat at times. The footage volcanoes and events are sometimes main characters too and the story of two lovers finding each other an pursuing the same goal can feel a bit lost at times.It´s both a beautiful but also raw movie. Seeing the Kraffts push for more and more danger because they see the destructive power of volcanoes really change the tone in a good way. To begin with we just see some beautiful red volcano footage but as a grey volcano destroy cities and land, we understand how dangerous this really is and the goal of researching grey volcanoes to make better safety and evacuation really put the Kraffts story into a bigger perspective. They were not just people fascinated by nature; they were scientist trying to help us all when nature becomes to much for us. Noble people are a good way to describe them.I also liked the angle of the beginning of the documentary. These people more or less documented their entire lives and will be remembered for all they did for volcano research, but their relationship, the way the meet, not really documented. What do we leave behind when we´re no longer here? A fascinating question, highlighted by showing the footage they captured in this doc.The ending also really got to me. It´s a tragic but beautiful at the same time.The small graphics and b-role used worked well for the doc. It´s mostly the footage shot by the Kraffts, but there are some things left to fill in by the people making this documentary and I think it worked in the context of the doc.I also found the way music and sound was used affective. Both for setting tone but also for really hammer home how dangerous this is.I loved this documentary and really appreciated what it showed. Not only did I learn a bit about volcanoes along the way, but I also saw footage that will forever leave me in awe and make me wonder what else I haven't seen on this earth. The footage is just that affective and beautiful that I had to question the reality of it. Th story of these two people are worth preserving and this documentary dose a great job at that.Oscar predictions: I think this has a good chance of winning best documentary. I haven't seen any of the other contenders, but this speaks to people in another way than just, sad or funny story. It´s more of a nature doc with added character and that is beautiful in it´s own way. It´s like an artistic showing of our earth and I think it will speak to academy. If it won, I would be happy.",False
18,7,"Beautiful scenes, Awful narration",HerrSupahz,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Fire of Love"" is a visually stunning documentary that immerses viewers in the awe-inspiring world of volcanoes. The film succeeds in delivering breathtaking footage of volcanic eruptions and their aftermath. The intensity and power of these natural phenomena are masterfully conveyed, making the experience truly memorable.The filmmakers' dedication to capturing the raw beauty and terrifying force of volcanoes is commendable. The use of slow-motion shots and time-lapse sequences adds depth and enhances the sensory experience, creating a captivating atmosphere. The intense colors, vibrant contrasts, and striking textures draw audiences into a mesmerizing world where nature's fury takes center stage.However, the film's one drawback is its narration, which regrettably detracts from its overall quality. The narrator has a monotonous voice and lackluster delivery, which drains the film of some energy and excitement. In a documentary that thrives on showcasing nature's power, a more enthusiastic and engaging narrator could have elevated the film to new heights. It's hard to believe that anyone could have previewed this film before release and thought ""well, the narration is fine"".Distractingly bad narration, but the stunning images prevail.",False
19,8,LOVE AMONGST NATURE...!,masonfisk,n/a,16/08/2025,"From last year comes a fascinating documentary about a real life love story over the love of volcanoes. Katia & Maurice Krafft were volcanologists who from the 60's through the early 90's spent time waking & sleeping w/volcanoes as they traveled the world following these erupting forces of nature sometimes after the affair concluded & in some cases right when the event has just taken place. Footage of their exploits would finance their journeys but after a particular eruption in Columbia (which was predicted by the couples fellow colleagues) caused damage & deaths numbering in the thousands, Katia fears their choice in vocation may lead them to their deaths (which unfortunately as the film lays out right at the beginning happens in 1991) but what we do have is an intoxicating collection of lava & eruptions that most viewers are happy to be a vast distance from but this intrepid pair wallowed in.",False
20,7,Stunning visuals,tudyniuz,n/a,16/08/2025,"While the documentary tries to tell the story of two people obsessed with volcanos, I found myself in awe of the incredible images the two of them captured 40-50 years ago. That is a feat in itself.The doc has a common narrative and covers the story of the two scientists from their beginnings all the way to their demise. There is no conflict, it's just a standard story told in a very newspaper-y way. It uses only archive footage and that is clearly a great choice, it keeps you within the story and era. The Kapadia style of documentary we've first seen more than a decade ago strikes again to great effect, it seems to be the new norm for these types of docs and it's used brilliantly here by Sara Dosa.Yes, the voice-over is horrible, but switching audio to another language is easy on streaming platforms. The French audio suits the doc as the two main characters are French themselves. And it's well done compared to the English voiceover.Overall, the story of the two characters is as boring as can be, but the incredible images they've captured is what will live long after their mundane story is forgotten.",False
21,8,Their love brought us closer to the Earth...,dqznkhjbs,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary's narrator declares in the end of the film that ""two scientists and their love (for volcanoes and each other) brought us closer to the Earth. Sara Dosa's proves as much in this hauntingly beautiful documentary that is equal parts quirky romcom and nature documentary.In watching Fire of Love, we are spectators to a transcendent affair between volcanologists, the Kraffts, and the planet we call home. Their archival footage is nothing short of breathtaking.Perhaps the only issue with the storytelling is that the subject of Katia and Maurice's marriage feels like more of an afterthought and did not get the full treatment it deserves. The Krafft's origin story read more like a newspaper article than a quirky love story. The saving grace that makes this film feel like an art house romance film were the inklings into the couple's personalities provided by the Kraffts' footage alone.Sara Dosa's treatment of their footage makes you feel as though you are climbing up those volcanoes and dipping your toes into a molten river with the fascinating, and oft-hilarious couple. The narration from Miranda July felt like we were listening to an ASMR recording. Yet, the choice to speak in such a way, simply makes the film feel as though it were all a dream that you want to relive over and over again.",False
22,7,An unremarkable film about remarkable people,scaryjase-06161,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unsurprisingly, I've never heard of this - I'm expecting a charming tale of two oddballs with some absolutely stunning footage. It seems a bit weird that someone's decided to make a film about them 21 years after they've died - but hey, let's give it a go.The first thing to say is that they weren't oddballs - they were full-on lunatics! But in a cool ""volcanoes are all we really care about"" kinda way - they met at university, got married, decided they weren't going to have kids and spent their lives visiting active volcanoes. As you do! And basically the film ""just"" follows them around showing us footage from their archive.It does indeed have stunning footage - volcanos are just pretty cool and lava is exceedingly hypnotic. There is loads of footage of them standing next to erupting volcanoes and some of the shots are just mad - the cover photo above is a still from some video but it looks more as though special effects have been used to create these tiny people next to massive eruptions or lava flows (often travelling REALLY quickly). In some cases you have to wonder who was taking the footage because both Maurice and Katia are in shot and it looks like a very unpleasant environment. There's also some horrific footage of Maurice's leg when he stepped in a volcanic pool - it's hard to believe he didn't lose it!The Kraffts come across as a fascinating couple - totally driven whilst still realistic enough that they know that others may not quite understand why they do what they do. The film also makes the interesting point that although they were scientists, they needed to pay the bills and hence were forced to be entertainers taking multiple shots before deciding which ones had the greatest effect. It also made me laugh a couple of times - Maurice testing Katia's volcanologist suit by chucking a big rock at her and Maurice frying eggs on a lava flow.I do have a couple of gripes - Miranda July's commentary was really quiet and I really had to pay attention to catch what she was saying. It's also ridiculously poetic - unnecessarily so given the no-nonsense attitude that Maurice and Katia appeared to have and you can't help but feel they would have scoffed at some of the imagery employed (although Katia definitely had a more romantic mindset than Maurice).The film spends remarkably little time on their deaths - which is fine if this is merely a joint obituary but, for me, not so much if it's a documentary. Yes, I appreciate they wouldn't want to be defined by their deaths (and beforehand they seemed remarkably accepting that it might well happen) but some more detail would have been appreciated. It would also have been nicer to spend a bit of time considering their legacy - it mentions in passing that 50,000 people were evacuated before Mount Pinatubo erupted because of their research, but that's about it. And one final comment is that the film really should have explained exactly what a pyroclastic flow was - I kinda knew but I suspect plenty of people don't!Wikipedia tells me that Werner Herzog has made two films about the Kraffts - and, knowing Werner, I have a sneaking suspicion they won't be quite as straightforward as this one. There's nothing outstanding about this film, but it's a perfectly watchable documentary about two interesting people with some great shots of eruptions and lava in it - if that sounds like something you'd enjoy, then I think it's safe to assume that you will enjoy this. At time of writing, it's available to stream on Disney+ or to rent at all the usual locations.",False
23,4,Narration ruins the movie,wallywonka69,n/a,16/08/2025,"What on Earth were they thinking getting Miranda July to do her stray cat-voice for the narration? Somebody involved must've pointed out how awful this decision was at some point in the production. They should've gotten a British guy to narrate. Often the soundtrack or volcanic foley would completely drown out the narration. The script wasn't terrible, but Miranda July imbues every word with saccharine anguish. What tone were they going for?Anyway, the footage is really cool, but the couple seems like total narcissists. They act like they're motivated by a pure love of fire, but I doubt they would do any of those daredevil shenanigans without filming them to show off. In many of the shots, the camera was already set up close enough to see everything from a safe distance, but the suicidal couple had to go even closer so they could get in frame and look cool. They died doing what they loved. They had this romantic idea of dying in a magma canoe ride and luckily went quickly in the eruption. I doubt it would've been so romantic if one of them got horrible third-degree burns all over their body.British narrator would've made this a 6.",False
24,10,4:3 Should make a comeback,JayDeadieEagle,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am absolutely astonished by the visuals documented and captured by Maurice ""not a filmmaker"" Krafft. Overwhelming visual storytelling, capturing the magnitude of these eruptions, with a logical sense of scale and crisp attention to detail. Beautiful balance of color, exposure, and framing, that kept me focused the whole way through. I was so engaged, my phone dropped out of my pocket around 20 minutes in and I didn't even bend over to get it until the end.I must also use this review to shout out how wonderful 4:3 aspect ratio is! I know it's archive footage and the production crew and editors didn't have much of a choice, but an absolute beauty of a choice it was to keep it organic.Wonderful score, Wes Anderson-esque Vibes, Educational, Beautiful, heartwarming, inspiring, and all around lovely film.EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS FILM!",False
25,10,Great film! one of my favs!,Roseplayer450,n/a,16/08/2025,"Simply an amazing film! Documentaries are hard to make fun, exciting, silly, but still emotional.I was glued to the screen the entire time, it was so fun, innovative, and respectful. I never knew anything about the subject matter so I was also learning a lot.I was not the biggest fan of the narration at first, but it quickly grew on me. I found the editing to be a great balance of fun and well thought out.I also met the director at a film festival, she is one of the nicest people I have ever spoken too. Huge congrats to her and all her success!",False

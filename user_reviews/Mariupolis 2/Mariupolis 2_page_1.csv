1,4,This is not a movie.. Just random scenes,Cassiopeia_the_Elf,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been an avid Ukrainian supporter in this war, both with money and other resources. I listen to news and of course knew about Mantas (director) death during filming, since I am Lithuanian.When this movie got awards, I was really looking forward to see it. But.. I was so disppointed by it.. Now I feel ashamed to give such a low rating (someone will start me blaming as Russian-fan, I guess), but this was NOT a movie.. Just random videos put together, some even filmed on mobile phone in vertical mode (!!) without any story idea, no soundtrack (well, maybe war documentaries don't need it, it's the sounds of bombing you hear and that is strong), no lighting editing... With long minutes of simply showing the horizon (maybe he was hoping to capture a missile flying? (and did in one scene) So many of such scenes), long long minutes where even a focused watcher starts to fade away, because nothing happens..Of course, there were couple VERY strong scenes, I must say that. The movie would be amazing if it was all like that. I understand it could not be finished, but maybe editors later could have added commentary, tell story of Mantas's capture. Anything to fill those empty gaps, to tell some story, to make this a movie, not a bunch of random shots.... :(",False

1,8,Fantastic documentary,mrouttt,n/a,16/08/2025,"More than a 'Making of' of the game, it's focus on what the team behind the game, GSC Game World, endure during the war cast up on them, their familys and their country.It's truly amazing and uplifting to watch their resilience. It's also a good way to understand how the actual development of a product can be messy through the vicissitudes of life.But no matter what, they seems to get a grip over the situation, soldier on, and are motivated than ever to deliver more than a game, but a symbol of courage and abnegation through everything.It's truly amazing that the game will come out at all when you realise how hard it has been to deliver it.Slava Oukra√Øni !",False

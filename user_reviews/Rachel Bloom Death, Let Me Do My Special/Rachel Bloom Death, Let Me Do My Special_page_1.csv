1,10,Love Rachel Bloom,laraklopp,n/a,16/08/2025,"She is herself, and she creates art. Art is not always for the masses, but it's always, well, art. In earning my MFA, my professor asked me if I'd rather create something that everyone was kind of ""hey that's okay"" about, or something that some people loved and other people hated. (I don't think people will hate Rachel Bloom unless they don't appreciate open expression and a lack of fear of bodily fluids etc) - Artists create art, and not everyone loves everyone's art. Rachel Bloom is an artist. Crazy Ex Girlfriend was brilliant art, and this special is profound and amazing. Is it for everyone? Certainly not. Is it fantastic, brilliant art? Yes.",False
2,10,Brilliant,wmikehemleppjr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rachel Bloom has her own unique voice. And even if what she does may not be for everyone, nobody does it better than her.The arc of this special mirrored her tv show ""Crazy Exgirlfriend"". It starts off silly and fun. Then it takes a sharp, somewhat awkward turn. Then once you are comfortable in this new place, it becomes profound. And then uncomfortable because the emotions are real. But then it lightens up, but differently. Because this time, when it goes back to silly... it is silly, sharp, profound, and real all at the same time and you learn something about yourself. I admit it; I laughed, and I cried. Just like her TV show, at the end you realize she knew where this was going the whole time and led you to a very satisfying awakening.",False
3,10,Yes!!!,T2TLED,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love absolutely unique and original material and Bloom delivers in spades. I was at this show the night before they taped this special and it was fantastic then and translates to TV quite well. David Hull was perfection. This is a very profound special and everyone should walk away with some feelings. It was very uncomfortable to watch, but once you get settled in, the ride is fantastic. Kudos to the crew for the set and lighting.I hope it wins any and all awards it gets nominated for!Again, this is the smart content audiences crave. Give this special a shot, you shouldn't be disappointed.",False

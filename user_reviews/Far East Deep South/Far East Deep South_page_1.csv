3,9,Watch this for many reasons,allie701,n/a,16/08/2025,"You will definitely learn something new about US history. Who knew there was a whole Chinese community in the Deep South, brought in after slavery ended? And who knew that only Chinese laborers were permitted to enter the country while Chinese women were excluded? And who knew of yet another shameful example of American racism that was made into law to exclude Chinese specifically?To keep this documentary from being a total historical downer, we see the results of this prejudice through the eyes of the son and grandsons of the original immigrant who have traveled to Louisiana to discover their roots.. And what we see are the harsh facts softened by modern acceptance and a whole lot of love. You will find yourself touched deeply when you learn, along with the family, of the very difficult decisions the father had to make and the love for his son that endured. All in all a powerful testament to the human spirit.",False
4,n/a,Captivating,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was absolutely captivated by this beautiful documentary. It was so well made and this family's story was so rich that it needed to be told. The history, the photographs, and the personal anecdotes evoked so many emotions within me. Have your Kleenex box ready. This is one that will stay with you. I am so glad I got to see this thanks to America ReFramed.",False
5,10,Fascinating,KeiraC-8,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Far East, Deep South"" offers a moving and unflinching look into a family's journey to find their roots through the life of their grandfather. Baldwin showcases dedicated effort to this journey through extensive archival work and narrative interviews, balancing the harshness of historical circumstances with the uplift of discovering one's roots.",False
6,10,Finding your roots and overcoming adversity...,kylerichardhenry,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a great film, really inspiring story of ""finding your roots"" and overcoming adversity. Also a story of solidarity in hard times, and doesn't leaving you feeling bad but inspired about our common history. So important to see right now in the United States because some films leave you not knowing how we can face our problems and move forward, this film does that!",False
7,10,Exploration of Family and Heritage,realtalkies,n/a,16/08/2025,"Far East Deep South sheds light on a lesser-known part of American history, transforming a dark chapter into a story of hope and unity. Intimate and deeply personal, it follows a family's journey to uncover their roots in the Mississippi Delta. Filmed in a raw, vlog-style format, it highlights the vital role of archivists and historians. Heartfelt and eye-opening-highly recommended for those seeking new perspectives on American history!",False
8,1,Meh to Another,sampecking,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another shameless knock-off of the Asian American experience this time sold on the novelty of the black American connection. Shaky camera movement and disorganized editing at points. We all felt we were watching a glorified home movie especially when every line began, ""And then"". Didn't think it was necessary to show every step of research and would probably have preferred to see the story told as a short documentary which it really is. Also would have like to see more of the black racism tied in. Instead seemed like a snapshot that was stretched out to make a longer film. If you are part of the communities involved in the film of course you enjoyed it more but we found it lagged after the first quarter. Sorry to be so forthright. We were saw it at no cost so I guess really can't complain either way. Move on to the next title if you are binge watching during this pandemic.",False

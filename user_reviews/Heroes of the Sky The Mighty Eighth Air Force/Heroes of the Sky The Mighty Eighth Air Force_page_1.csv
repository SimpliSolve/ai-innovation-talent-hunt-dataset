1,8,Good job,drjgardner,n/a,16/08/2025,"Heroes of the Sky does what a good documentary should do - it informs and it entertains. There is little new here, but the focus on the air force gives a different perspective. Usually we focus on the navy or the infantry or the tanks., so it's refreshing to see some of these battles from a different perspective.",False
2,10,Informative,jfslate,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is a well-rounded, informative view of the 8th Air Force. It honors the men who served our country well. It was well done and clearly told, with astounding archival footage. I highly recommend anyone who is interested in World War II to watch this.",False
3,10,Excellent history of the WWII European Army Air Force during,cliffhewlett,n/a,16/08/2025,"World War II in Europe in fact, all wars are bloody affairs.World War Ii was a bloody affair for civilians also, with lots of blame to be handed out to both sides.This film highlights the efforts of the US Army Eight Air Force and their mission in Europe during World War II.Early on in the war, the Eight suffered horrendous losses over German held territory, which was later alleviated by the long range fighter escorts.Mostly color, photography and narration by the words of the actual participants makes this an interesting video.The film is true to the facts and does not gloss over mistakes or errors.A must see for those who are interested in the real facts of World War II!",False
4,1,usual brainwash,gordocooper,n/a,16/08/2025,"They dropped bombs on civilians' heads. Does that make heroes or criminals out of them?
Well, it all depends on who wins the war.
Only that is the truth.",False

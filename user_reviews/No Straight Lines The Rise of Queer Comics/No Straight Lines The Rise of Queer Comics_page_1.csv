1,10,Fantastic Documentary,susan-32489,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fascinating look at the origins of the underground gay, lesbian and queer comix scene starting in the 1970's.Mostly told through the words and voice of the creators of the time, interspersed with snippets of their work.Loved finding ourt more about Alison Bechdel and creators I wasn't familiar with. I continually had to pause the play because I wanted to admire the art for much longer than the on screen time allowed.",False
2,10,Well Done Documentary,littleicat,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary presents the history of the queer comics scene and interviews many notable authors including Alison Bechdel, Jen Camper, Howard Cruse and Rupert Kinnard!It's arguably the best comics documentary that I have ever seen. The producer not only does an amazing job getting interviewees to talk about history, their process and their work, but also the personal impact their work has had in some pretty emotional ways.The documentary also introduces you to up and coming queer comics artists who give their commentary on their predecessors and the new LBGTQ Comics scene new scene.Also just about all of the comics can be read in the companion book anthology, No Straight Lines edited by Justin Hall.Great film check it out!",False

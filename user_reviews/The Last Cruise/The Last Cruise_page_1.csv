1,6,"Not Too Soon - A Simple, Ok Documentary",neener3707,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who worked in retirement home for the elderly with dementia (that was hit hard) at the time these events happened and indeed the rest of this pandemic that yes, is still happening, I really wanted to see this one. I wanted to see what it was like for them on that ship and compare it to my own experience. So maybe I have some bias but I will admit, the documentary wasn't as ominous and clean cut as the trailer, it was an ""ok"" documentary. But considering what little footage they had to work with, I suppose it was a serviceable enough job.There is a lot of politics surrounding this virus so hopefully people will keep that out of their reviews, I know I will.Unfortunately a lot of it is filmed on phones so that may bug some people as I see it bug people in reviews for other documentaries. But like I said considering what little footage they probably had to work with, I'd say it was well enough put together. It was odd for me to watch personally, I myself witnessed the senior community I worked at turn into a ghost town/prison, I remember having to continue working and wondering everyday if I was going to get it, whether I was safe or if I was going to give it to someone else. So the way they portray the ghost ship was chilling, to me at least, from my opinion it was shown accurately.Classism definitely reared its heads in this documentary. I do though wish they focused less on the passengers and more on the crew, I feel they showed more of the passengers and I found it sad they didn't put more focus on the injustice and anxiety of the crew, which they did touch on, but certainly not enough. At least I got to go home at the end of 16 hour shift, these poor people had to work in cramped conditions with little to no protection or understanding of what was happening. Again, they did touch on it, but more emphasis could have been put on those poor people, who got to watch rich Americans leave while they worked their fingers to the bone to keep those passengers alive.I understand the passengers were bored and frustrated, but I found some of them incredible pretentious, ungrateful, and downright rude, and I did not have the sympathy for them in the way I think the documentary wanted me to. Dementia patients I worked for in the senior home complained less than these people. Its almost as if these people thought the same level of pre-Covid service they were promised would continue in a situation like this, I only really felt emotional for one of the passengers and his wife. But the rest of the portions of the passenger segments left me uninterested and kind of insulted as someone who worked during these hard time in one of the most dangerous places.All in all it was a slightly above middle of the road documentary, not amazing but told the story the best they could with what little they had.",False
2,5,A crew member review!!!!,vaskicka,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a crew member who got stuck on a cruise ship during the big pause. I can write a book how hard was it for everyone. Me personally had friends on Diamond,crew, who were texting in a group chat that they had very very less to eat, and they were allowed to eat only 3 times per day in a certain time. So forgot about snacks, coffee etc. And they were given one bottle of water for three days per person!!!!!! They were guarding the guests in 3 shifts bc plenty of them tried to escape from the cabines claiming Corona does not exist. They were stressed because they were in cabin with roomates and every crew member was in touch with a guest at a certain point and back then no one really knew anything specific about Covid. Most of the time they were without Internet so could not talk to their families. They were crying every day and I cried watching this because it says only terrible things about the crew. And when they were sent home their country did not want them saying they bring the virus. So none of this is mentioned in the documentary. Thats why I gave it a 5.",False
3,7,Crew were treated worst then animals,joaosantos20,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm sorry but if you don't know what the virus does or if it can even kill, and these idiots quarantine the passengers and not the crew.These people have no humanity, they were treated like disposable just to cather to the passenger.Sickening.",False
4,7,That was a long 40 minutes. But not in a bad way.,khawz-10125,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think reviews that complain about narcissistic and ignorant people in this short documentary/film are missing the point. We are watching to see what happened. Not what we wish we could see. I think this is a great little film showcasing actual footage (no simulated or acted out scenes) of what happened on that cruise ship. It's surreal, haunting and honest.",False
5,6,Unfinished,NewNostalgicReview,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerStarted great. Loved that they used so much can footage taken by crew and passengers. But it just abruptly ends. I thought it was just the first episode as well which would've made sense. But that doesn't seem to be the case. We only got a few perspectives and there is so much more to this story. I don't understand why this was released when it could've been excellent. Good idea though. I'm sure more will come out soon.,True
6,6,Cringe Warning,rdeegan-52307,n/a,16/08/2025,The passengers they interviewed were really annoying to listen to. I mean they need video and the only people that had footage were daily vloggers so that might be the reason. Good documentary but I now understand what Bill Burr was talking about.,False
7,7,Watching a global health crisis mushroom in front of your very eyes,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The Last Cruise"" (2021 release; 40 min.) is a documentary about the infamous cruise ship the Diamond Princess, which left the port of Yokohama, Japan on January 20, 2020 (the very day that the WHO officially declared the coronavirus a pandemic), and it wasn't long before a first passenger tested positive, and then another and then another...Couple of comments: this is the second documentary written-produced-directed by up-and-coming Hannah Olson, who debuted with last year's excellent ""Baby God"" documentary. Here she retells what one could term ""the voyage of the doomed"", as the gigantic cruise ship (housing 3000+ guests and staff) becomes an international pariah and immediate symbol for the devastation brought by an unknown and highly contagious new virus. Olson introduces us to two US couples as well as 2 staff (a dishwasher from Indonesia, a pastry chef from I believe India), and we follow their ups (a few) and down (a lot). It makes for fascinating viewing, to be honest. Predictably the footage is mostly derived from the smart phones of the guests and staff. While there are no winners here of course, I felt particularly bad for the staff, who literally go begging in international TV news outlets, begging for their rescue. The footage of the staff cramped together in close quarters, knowing full well that the virus is spreading, is just sickening. Another can't miss moment is that the US guests are watching US TV coverage and you can hear how Trump and his band of jokers keep claiming that ""we've got it completely under control"". Wow, just wow. What an utter and complete incompetent fool. If I have any complaint about this documentary, it is that at just 40 min. The documentary flashes by in no time, and it seems to me there was plenty of room for additional footage and coverage.""The Last Cruise"" premiered last month at SXSW to immediate buzz, and just recently started showing on HBO. It is now available on HBO On Demand (where I caught it), Amazon Instant Video and other streaming services. If you have any interest in how the world was dealing with COVID-19 in its earliest days, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
8,9,Truly horrifying,Icestarfish-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I felt sick the entire time watching this. I can't imagine the fear these people had and the will to keep going every day. It could have been longer and finished the stories of the people who were taken off the ship to the hospital, and the ones who were stuck on the ship longer.",False
9,7,Feel for the Crew,thalassafischer,n/a,16/08/2025,"I debated on whether or not I even wanted to watch this. People who take cruise ships are usually either elderly and out of touch or upper middle class to wealthy and entitled, while all of the above utterly ignore the grave impact cruise ships have on carbon emissions and the state of our world's precious oceans. I totally expected the self-absorption that some other reviewers are complaining about. BUT I remember being obsessed with the horror of this particular cruise ship in 2020 so I thought well if I hate it I can just turn it off.The experience of the poor crew is the core reason you should watch this documentary. To contrast the experience of the travelers to the workers is eye-opening. I can only imagine the sadness and barely controlled rage of these individuals who were put at risk, and I was glad to hear their stories and appalled to see just how many were non-English speaking and non-Western and brown skinned....of course a corporation was treating these human beings as second class citizens, it's always an important reminder to see it full color though.I think there should have been more coverage on the people who died on this ship, there were 14 victims. Perhaps the director felt it was exploitative but really that should have been shown more attention.",False
10,4,What a missed opportunity for what could have been a great doc!,virginia-913-95834,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I started this I was definitely very interested in the topic and the situation. It just seemed like a doc of halfway developed arcs and never told a full story. I feel like there were so many missed opportunities to learn more about the backstory of the guests that were featured, the crewmembers, the families at home, comparing what was going on on the ship to what was going on in other places, etc. And also - my goodness - what happened to these people? What was it like when they got home? Who are the people that died? Who got sick after the flight? There was so much either left on the table or on the cutting floor. I think this documentary could've been so great and just wasn't developed enough.",False
11,8,Horrifying,andrearubin-42814,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is one of the most frightening things I have seen on television in a very long time. I almost regret watching it, that's how uncomfortable it's left me feeling. If I had been on that boat I probably would have lost my mind. The people who were profiled, although at times seemed stressed and a little emotional, appeared to be pretty calm and level headed throughout the entire ordeal. My takeaway from this one - count your blessings and keep washing your hands.",True
12,7,good and honest...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"And more will be made.a time stamp of the human coronation era,im glad i wasnt there(i was at canry islands among thousands of italians,squaldring and discussing by the crowded sunbeds in the italian manner,me biting nails of contaigous angst)thanks to all leasing their situation to us. A little recommend from tgom.",False
13,3,Interviewed the wrong people,ladyliliroche,n/a,16/08/2025,"They put more sympathetic light on the passengers who basically ate well and had a longer vacation instead of the crews.Like, I'm sure there was still cabin fever and it sucks to be stuck in a room for months (lucky for those that book a bigger room), but the crews definitely had it worse.Another reviewer already spelt out the hardship of what the crew had to do. The captain must be stressing thinking of what he should do to elevate the mood. How bout the food sourcing and whether management of the cruise did their best to help them?In the end the documentary came off as entitled and not that informative or interesting.",False
14,7,Not a story about disparity but third and first world countries.,centipede-25367,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirstly, this is such a horrible incident for everyone onboard. I don't think there is any reason to rate the horrid experiences the people onboard experienced. Whether one is on the shop as a passenger or employee, it was terrible for all.While there are some who have written reviews on the pit of touch rich and the disadvantaged brown skinned crew, I'm not entirely sure what these people are reviewing? Is it the class system? Or the environment.I didn't like what one of the woman who insinuated that because the people are rich, they get looked after. She seems to have forgotten, that one group went on the ship by paying to have a holiday and the other group went in to get paid to work. It's as if she thinks paying guests should wander down the kitchen to get food for themselves? How is that going to work?The so called brown people, while they have sacrificed to be away from family and friends, they went on the ship willingly because it pays well better than what their country's economy can give them. It is so condescending having to read these privileged people wanting to be the savior of these ""helpless poor people"". The so-called rich on the ship are not that rich and if they come, the people can have a job to get paid.Some who work on ships do so because they want to travel and see places while getting paid.Did the crew have smaller rooms? Yes. It's no different from resort employees who have to take up residence in hotel grounds. The disparity between rich and poor is also everywhere third world countries' and 5 star hotels.What people should be seeing is that how each government looks after their citizens in times of calamity. Americans got out because they have funds to do so. Indonesians got out last because the level of corruption in their country is so severe that it cripples their economy. So that is where the problem lies.",True
15,7,no one's getting me on a cruise,lee_eisenberg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Without a doubt, COVID dominated the news in 2020. As it turns out, an early outbreak of the virus - before it got declared a pandemic - took place aboard a cruise ship. ""The Last Cruise"" focuses on said cruise, interviewing passengers and crew members. Harrowing stuff.Admittedly, at only forty minutes the documentary has a limit on how much it can address. What we should take away from it is that it was a terrible idea to have the cruise amid reports of the virus popping up around the globe. One thing that I can tell you is that you're never getting me on a cruise. In addition to the risk of a disease spreading aboard the ship, I simply don't like the idea of being in a confined space for a long time when there are other ways to see the world.Not a masterpiece, but worth seeing.",False
16,8,All these reviews are based on only one episode - there are more coming!,zilguh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think it is pretty sad that people did not even know they are watching a docuseries HBO is releasing week by week. So saying it leaves more to be desired, well YEAH because there IS more. I really enjoyed it as such.I liked seeing the behind the scenes things going on with the crew. There were a few people who they interview and utilize their footage of the happenings during the lockdown on the ship. I felt the fear and what a bind everyone on the crew was. I work in a kitchen myself, so I could see myself being in their shoes.I peripherally know people who were on the MS Zaandam shortly thereafter and the situtation, response, issues with sick crew, etc. Was almost exactly the same. So to say the documentary crew failed to do the situation justice makes no sense because they're telling it like it is. Sure, maybe they shouldn't have created a very ""ominous"" trailer but I think in and of itself it IS ominous. When I think back to where I was in feb/march of 2020, this situation and this documentary feels surreal to watch.I am looking forward to THE REST OF THE EPISODES which I would have watched prior to my writing any review because writing a review based on ONE episode is less then ideal, but I wanted to make this point so others won't snub this documentary because people are uninformed. Sigh.",False
17,1,Narcissistic people everywhere,RJBrez,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm sure this is the first project of many to come documenting this awful time frame. I immediately regretted my decision to view this film when I realized just how full of themselves these people are on a day to day basis. They were filming themselves every single moment of every day long before they even heard the word ""COVID"". I understand it's a microcosm of today's society and it just makes me want to scream.I don't care what your salad looks like. I don't care about YOLo or #'s or any of it. I don't want to watch you walk around and try to be cool. It's all disgusting.Rant aside, this movie is a collection of personal cellphone footage from self centered people. They are so distraught by what's going on that taking out their cell phones and recording themselves is the only ""cure"" they need. So pathetic.#Ihatewhattheworldhasbecome.",False
18,10,So Brave.........,glistensisnotgold,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. What a superb documentary. Apart from the passengers I was so interested but sad to hear from the staff. I only discovered cruising 4 years ago. I must say I felt a little torn on the cruises due to my perceived knowledge regarding the crew. I felt I was very lucky to be on a cruise. Despite the professionalism and happiness of all the crew when you dig further you understand the huge sacrifices some crew members are making in regard to getting a job on a ship in an effort to support their families.This documentary has proven my understanding of the situation when crew go to sea. Surely, if passengers could pay more for their tickets the crew could be paid more. That is if the huge cruise companies would agree and pay their workers what they are really worth. Hmmmm, instead of maybe tunnelling the extra revenue into their own coffers.Many of the crew members come from developing nations. To many of them the salary they receive on the ship is better than was is paid at home. That is another subject altogether.Will I cruise again? I will be checking all the cruises I may wish to sail on but will be asking questions regarding the wages and conditions of the crew. I shall choose the company who looks after its workers the best.How brave were these workers on the Diamond Princess?Thank you Ms Hannah for this enlightening and realistic portrayal of what happened during that cruise.",False
19,2,No Real Substance,LaDolceVita60,n/a,16/08/2025,It was like a bad found footage movie. These passengers are the reason I don't cruise anymore. Self absorbed and selfish. No thoughts about the safety of the crew. This doc could have been so much more about how crew members are treated to keep these boats afloat.,False
20,4,Contrast between working class and white privileged people,seiersenwhite,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe start was promising, the development failed
The interesting contrast is between passengers, which most don't have a clue of humility and love in a bubble: then you have the crew.For them or was cramped windowless spaces, sharing with sick peers, working for the passengers and not being tested or quarantined as the passengers
There are unfortunate comments regrading comfort, complaints about frozen food, being bored, the crew nor being as friendly, and using face masks - in the middle of a pandemic (The passengers obviously)
So it presents the real struggle, fear and injustice from the crew vs the selfish complaints, superficial remarks and self centered world of passenger (one just loved the kimono type pijama she was wearing at the hospital in Japan as she tested positive)This could have had more depth by having more diversity among the passengers and crew
Filtering the comments to balance the end results, more interest in the emotional experience and effects rather than then daily domestic circumstances.It's wasn't challenging for the ""cast"" nor the audience, and remains as a description of events without covering more important topics: humanity, fragility, fears, hopes, consciousness or responsibility.",True
21,1,Americans make more drama than anyone else in the world,ballgray,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerIt is a great comedy showing how americans are drama princesses and it all about their emotions that counts.The ship guests were treated very well in my opinion. They just had longer vacation. The crew members not so much.,True
22,4,Why do we care about ignorant rich people?,laurafluck,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary totally missed the mark. It had a real opportunity to show the early days of COVID from the perspective of people truly affected by illness and fear... and while some of the disparity of the haves vs have-nots was on display, it was done in such a way that I think the filmmakers wanted us to feel sorry for the passengers. Granted, I may have done, had they not showcased mostly ignorant, rude, self-absorbed westerners who we know proved during 2020 that they don't care about anyone but themselves. ""Who cares if my stylist dies from a virus, I want a haircut!"" (You know, THOSE people.)Also, as an aside - if you suffer from motion sickness, the first first cell phone footage in this documentary may trigger you.",False
23,4,Our lives for the past year.,jaswards,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAt this moment, this is just rubbish. It's the same exact thing all of us went through. The only good thing about it is that it's not a hit piece against president Trump, and does point out the fraud that Fauci is, perhaps without intention.",True
24,4,"Wrong place, wrong time",Horst_In_Translation,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""The Last Cruise"" is a 40-minute HBO production for the small screen from 2021 and this is not a movie dealing with the magnificent Tom Cruise, but instead the focus is on the corona virus during those days where it all began back in 2020. The director and producer is Hannah Olsen and the writer is Lizzie Presser and for both it is a contender for most known work at this point. It runs for 40 minutes, so it is still a short film, but a pretty long one for that. I guess like with many HBO short documentary productions the goal is to get this one to the Oscars, but here things did not really work out from that perspective. The biggest success awards-wise was apparently a nomination with the documentary critics choice folks. However, it was probably seen by more people than many Oscar-nominated documentary shorts in fact. Of course, being an American production helped here, even if it is not super easy these days anymore to get a hand on the film. To sum it up quickly, you can say that this film is about a cruise and the people on it when the corona virus showed up on their ship and we find out how the numbers were constantly increasing. At the beginning, there was one person that got tested positive or two, then it's ten, another ten, sixty or so and finally hundreds eventually. So as there was a lot of isolation and quarantine going on, a great deal of the film is what the travelers were recording themselves during this fateful trip that went much longer than they expected, even if not for the right reasons. The saddest moment is maybe when we find out that somebody died from the virus and in the end it was a double-digit amount of people as we are told. Another sad moment was when a couple is separated because one of them has the virus and the other does not.Here and there, there were also some exaggerations like how passengers talked about the possibility of the government deciding to sink the ship and drown everybody on it and that was a bit too much pseudo drama honestly. It was more interesting to see the healthy American passengers choosing to board an American military plane that would fly them home. Definitely a voyage you will remember for the rest of your life, but a good thing then when one of the positive passengers said that this is not gonna ruin the fun she has when it comes to going on cruises and the next travel will certainly happen soon. So she was positive in two ways you could say. A good and not so good. This documentary is pretty much exactly what you could expect when reading the two lines of summary what it is all about. There were some interesting moments like when they said that back then they did not know yet that people could be without symptoms and still carry the virus in them. Or everything we saw about the crew was nice too. They of course had their very own role in all this. Nonetheless, I must say that overall the documentary did not feel interesting or relevant enough to me for a positive recommendation here. It was almost more interesting to find out through words being shown on the screen what was happening globally and how for example the virus at that point was not a factor at all in America. Even Dr. Fauci said so. Literally. And this is also not the cruise that was the one thing that carried the virus from Asia into the world. It is just one of many pieces of the puzzle you can say and as such you are not missing out on too much if you decide to skip the watch here. Admittedly, it is also never on failure territory. But I give ""The Last Cruise"" a thumbs-down. Don't like the pseudo-dramatic title here either to be honest, but I am not surprised at all that such a film got made by the (mostly) liberal broadcaster HBO.",True
25,1,Pathetic,Kat_Years,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAside from feeling a little bad for the crew, I couldn't feel sorry for any of these people. It's embarrassing the way people(Americans, I'm assuming) were complaining about food and bathrooms after less than a day of inconvenience. There are literally wars and genocides going on in this world. Absolutely pathetic and laughable the things people were crying about in the grand scheme of life. Not one single human was even injured. I worked on cruise ships for 9 years and have been through much scarier things than this, hurricanes and terrifying weather with incredible captains who kept us alive. Continue with the fine American tradition of suing companies. You all look so ridiculous I have zero sympathy. Poop in a bag, you sad dramatists. As someone who loves documentaries this is the BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME.. IT DOESN'T GET BETTER.",True

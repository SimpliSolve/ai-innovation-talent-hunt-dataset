1,10,Powerful film!,glick-07768,n/a,16/08/2025,"The First Step explores contemporary ""politics"" on the ground and in a very nuanced, compelling, and intimate way. The documentary doesn't follow a simple three-act structure or devolve into biopic territory. Importantly, it does raise critical questions about the opportunities and challenges for making progressive social change in general and building support for legislation in particular. The First Step is a powerful film, perfect for students as well as those interested in an intense, verite-style documentary about our contentious political moment.",False
2,10,Incredibly moving and insightful. One of the best docs I've seen in years,theavishai,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a time of incredible political deadlock, The First Step shows what it's like to find a middle ground, along with the benefits and the consequences of compromise. The film not only gives viewers an inside look into the complexity and messiness of the legislative process, but it also is a moving portrait of Van Jones and his evolution as a social justice advocate.While there have been numerous political documentaries in recent decades, many get caught up in partisan bias. And thats where the First Step succeeds, doing its best to bring the viewer in without forcing a specific perspective, leaving the audience to recognize that nothing is complete and progress is an ever evolving.",False
3,10,Timely and thoughtful documentary,madelineenos,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film had all the aspects of an engaging documentary. There's some good action and nail biting suspense with Van Jones and team trying to archive their seemingly impossible goal. There are also universal themes as Van explores his early life and serves as a imperfect leader on a hero's journey to tryIng to make a positive chance against all odds. There are so many problems with the criminal justice system and this film thoughtfully explores that while capturing visually stunning backdrops in DC, South Central LA, and West Virginia. This story mirrors the high emotional stakes of a country that is currently in turmoil, and highlights the people who are working to hard to try to make things better.",False
4,10,Brilliant story that bravely stands in the middle,sealexander-29146,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film gives you hope that in our polarized times that there is a path forward, but it will take bravery and smarts to get there.The filmmakers were able to get unexpected access to politicians and decisions makers while the legislative process was happening. In most other documentaries all you get is interview recaps. ...this rally grounded the film and connects you emotionally to the tension that the subjects were feeling as they fought for progress.",False
5,7,a uniting crusader,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. The old adage goes, ""Politics makes for strange bedfellows."" And there may have never been a stranger pairing than Donald Trump advisor (and son-in-law) Jared Kushner and CNN political contributor and activist Van Jones. The two joined forces to push through a prison reform bill that resulted in 10,000 prisoners gaining early release.Documentarian Brandon Kramer stuck with Jones during his crusade, and the final product delivers insight into the complex world of politics. Now, you might not consider either Kushner or Jones to be true politicians, but the fact is, they worked together to make the system pay attention to a cause that mattered to both ... despite their polar opposite political views. This was red and blue working in unison for a shared cause - just the way the two-party system was designed to work.However, the most fascinating piece isn't that republicans and democrats came together for a cause. No, the shocker was the criticism and vitriol Jones received from those on HIS side. It was the democrats and the BLM group who were so adamantly against negotiating with the Trump administration, that they were willing to sacrifice the cause - and those who would benefit. Fortunately, Van Jones, a Yale educated lawyer, is a passionate and intelligent man, and not one easily dissuaded from pursuing what he believes to be righteous causes.Jones is the kind of guy who, when seated on a panel at a conservative function, gets asked, ""Van Jones, what are you doing here?"" When discussing the ""whitelash"" of the 2016 election, Jones proclaims it's not enough to be anti-Trump; we have to be for something positive. Jones' personal library includes many volumes that help him ""know the enemy."" And his fascination with all things Superman - t shirts, comics, bedspreads - offers some insight into his personality.The most interesting segment of the documentary features Jones bringing together two diametrically opposed groups for a shared cause. Inner-city Los Angeles folks and rural West Virginia residents couldn't be any different on their views of Trump, but they do share the pain of drug addictions tearing apart their communities. These two groups try to understand their disparate political views, but mostly they share the desire to rid their communities of the personal tragedies brought on by drugs. Jones uses this to prove how complex the issues are when it comes to prison reform ... and sentence reform.At times, this Kramer documentary feels like cheerleading for Van Jones, but it also shows just how complicated and confusing and emotional political topics can become in the world of Washington DC. The pushback Jones receives from his own side (having a white ex-wife doesn't help) speaks to how close-minded folks have become, and even though this was filmed during the Trump era, the divide still exists today. The real message to me is that intelligent, persistent crusaders working for a just cause, and willing to deal with those throughout the political spectrum, are today's real superheroes.Available on VOD beginning April 4, 2023.",False
6,10,Thought provoking and moving,briandbates,n/a,16/08/2025,"There was so much I wanted to discuss after watcing The First Step. Van Jones' work is a fascinating window into some important issues of our time. I was blown away by Van's passion, eloquence, and willingness to dive into controversy for what he believes. The tension between ideologic purity and the messiness of compromise and bridge-building needed to get stuff done was absolutely captivating. The filmmakers display a lot of integrity and kindness in allowing space for a variety of people to express their deep, passionate opinions, most of which are informed by experiences with the cruelty of incarceration, racism, and addiction. The intimate footage with an all-star cast of celebrities and politicians is incredible, but the humanity, courage, and suffering of the non-celebrity people presented in the film moved me to tears multiple times. Both my brain and heart worked hard.",False
7,7,A Model for Getting Things Done,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Getting things done often calls for tremendous cooperation and a degree of compromise. That's especially true in a political context, particularly these days, where a little can sometimes get one a lot. Attorney and CNN Commentator Van Jones found that out firsthand during his efforts to help secure Congressional passage and presidential enactment of a sweeping prison reform bill during the Trump Administration, a piece of legislation - the First Step Act - that the commander in chief surprisingly supported. However, the opposition to this venture didn't always come from the places Jones might have expected; he often faced it from constituencies that he had hoped to count on in moving the initiative forward, individuals and groups that once backed him and now even went so far as to label the life-long liberal Democrat as a sell-out and an Uncle Tom. This chiefly came about for his efforts at building bridges and consensus among disparate communities that all stood to benefit from the bill's provisions, bringing supporters together in a spirit of purposeful collaboration. Director Brandon Kramer's documentary about this ambitious though sometimes-controversial venture provides an in-depth look at its history, the tumultuous path Jones traversed and the inventive steps he employed in promoting its viability, as well as the personal cost to its chief advocate. The film documents how to develop a unified coalition of unlikely partners in an age of partisan polarization, a model that could readily be drawn upon to help bring about reforms in other areas at a time when gridlock has all but stalled the traditional political process. Admittedly, the material here could have been a little better organized in terms of its presentation sequence, staying a little more tightly focused and eliminating a lot of needless skipping around. However, that aside, ""The First Step"" delivers an important message about what's possible when committed souls put their minds and collective efforts together to achieve a meaningful goal, something that I'm sure most of us want out of our nation's leadership. And, in the wake of recent midterm election results, it's something that politicians had better heed and take seriously.",False
8,10,A thoughtful portrait of making change happen in American politics,emmanuellebelanger,n/a,16/08/2025,I was moved by this documentary and its ability to capture individual stories while representing the larger challenge of getting things done and reaching consensus in a divided America.,False
9,10,The ART and Pain of Politics shown with Humanity,generasp-954-106658,n/a,16/08/2025,"This Documentary shows the Art and Cost of taking on a Human Cause with political machinations. There are those who live for a cause and those who play with the same. Van Jones Lives It! Many of the politicians are just out to make points with their base... And will do so without finding the truth behind the ideas. All sides have their reasons for the way they make a mark. Each viewpoint sees a road to an endgame. Few are seeing to the best interests of those most effected. So Many ways to see the issue, so few willing to work for the best possible result that is attainable. Mr. Jones can see what can be... And he works for that! This film itself is a symbol of its content, 400 hours edited down to 90 minutes. Things worth archiving have such great costs, time being one. This film is a chess game and a life investment that is much greater than a game and can be seen as a worthy investment. A work of ART... that has impacted thousands of lives and will continue to add to that number. Wonderful to experience such a thought provoking and powerful story! I solute the Director for making this marvelous Social Commentary with a Vast Heart.",False
10,10,Being in 'the room where it happens'!,pfindlay000,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all - as a documentary filmmaker myself - I just want to say, wow!!What a beautifully constructed and executed film. Those five years you spent making it certainly bear out on screen! First rate from top to bottom. The producing (getting access, the ambition of the story), the directing (capturing so many great moments, the deft use of verite scenes to drive the storytelling, the sense of really 'being in the room'), and the shooting, sound, cutting and music (too many good things to list here!).I just read a couple of the reviews that focused on the problem of building the film around Van - and his willingness to cross political lines to gain a limited objective - and while I understand the broader political critique, from a storytelling perspective I think you guys absolutely made the right call. Even if you're inclined to squirm at Van sharing time, shoulder to shoulder, with the reptilian Jared Kushner, the film still revolves around the serious issue of how to move the political blockage in Congress forward in a sophisticated way. And at least in this one very specific instance, the needle was significantly moved...Congratulations to you and Brandon!",False
11,10,Fantastic and thought provoking film,mcarper-86856,n/a,16/08/2025,Very fascinating to watch how we can find common ground when our country feels so divided. Thought provoking. Highly recommend making this a priority to watch next!,False
12,10,No matter what.,fitlasko,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film was very moving, especially during the times we are in. You get to see how real people have been impacted by the drug pandemic. People just like you and me. It was very powerful to see both sides come together and take action.",False
13,10,Masterful!,sid-43545,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this documentary a few weeks ago, and my mind keeps coming back to it over and over again. In an age where so many documentaries try to sell an idea or point of view, The First Step is a breath of fresh air. It is a film that moves me deeply because it shows the incredible difficulty of working on politics and, especially, policy. This is all the more amplified when the topic is connected to racial justice and criminal justice reform.It is difficult to overstate the effort that the filmmakers took to show different perspectives and points of view through the film. Van Jones and all the other people in the film are portrayed as humans, with all the complexities, limitations and messiness that comes with being a human. They are treated with respect and given a voice.I caught myself wishing for more documentaries like this many times since I watched it. However, I also realize that this is a special gem given the quality of the characters and filmmakers. Most importantly, there is the serendipity of those cameras having been on as history was being made.",False
14,10,The Art and Battle of Finding Common Ground,erin_casey-36262,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an advocate for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people as well as a prison abolitionist, I was very pleased with my viewing experience. This documentary demonstrates the field mine that is American politics and partisanship Van Jones navigates alongside Louis L. Reed and their organization cut50, in the effort of advancing reform within the legal system. The scope of criticism and Jones' visible willingness to communicate with people across the board is admirable. It is a testament to the direction and production of this documentary which is thoroughly considered and executed. I approached and left this film with my own beliefs and understanding of reform as an abolitionist, yet I saw one of the most critical abolitionist values demonstrated throughout: humanity. This documentary beautifully illustrates the through-line of centering humanity in an incredibly polarizing American culture. The art and battle of finding common ground as a means to liberation for all of us. My reflection of this documentary is ongoing. It has tasked me with the mission of working against being stuck in an echo chamber. I urge others to support this film and challenge yourself in a way you may have not considered before. Well done to all involved in this project, especially director Brandon Kramer and REFORM alliance's Louis L. Reed.",False
15,10,Important,scottlunt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not only is this a very well crafted film, it is one of those films that I consider an important watch for any American voter. The First Step takes us through the ""sausage making"" in the halls of congress and helps to convey that making change is difficult but worth the struggle. Van Jones is a conflicted protagonist, resolute and compassionate, but carries baggage. This only adds to the film's main point - we are all flawed but need to move toward progress nonetheless. Well done.",False
16,10,Relevant and TIMELESS,nathanmemerson,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film follows ""controversial"" figure Van Jones navigate reform and get legislation passed even if it's only a ""First Step"". Being shunned by his own party, demonized by fellow activists, he tries to prevail by doing what is right and starting the conversation between both parties. The story is humanizing and shows how public figures shouldn't bend to current media landscape or ""the loudest voices"".The film is relevant because of the people involved. But it is timeless as it reflects the common ground Americans have with opposing parties. The dream would be if politicians tried to make bills we all agree on vs making statements and just trying to win. Here is a story of what that could look like. It makes us hopeful that there are people willing to risk their reputation and career for what is right. It does not show Van Jones as a savior, but exposes how perspectives can change and how much work it takes to lobby a cause.The film brings a range of emotions and will leave you questioning what you just saw from familiar faces you may have once loved or hated. We need more films like this, films that don't push a political agenda but helps reframe your view of the world.",False
17,8,Essential viewing,nick-37209,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching the film on VOD. A captivating journey through the tricky, sticky and often painful fight for social justice and a compelling study of a complex character.",False
18,10,A must see Documentary of our time,nlh682000,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first step is a moving, inspiring and emotional film that takes the viewer on a political ride on what it takes to get legislation past in today's Washington's polarizing climate. Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, this film demonstrates that people from different parts of the country that don't share political beliefs can get things done. With Van Jones as their leader, he takes immense grief from both sides of the aisle but still moves forward in accomplishing his goals. The filmmakers do a tremendous and rare accomplishment in showing honest moments with Van Jones surrounded by negativity on his own political island.I also loved how the filmmakers raised the big question in politics: Are we going to pass a compromised bill to get a little, or are we holding out to get a lot? Or is the left going to get prison reform passed, giving Trump a win? These were hot button questions during the Trump presidency and were all well discussed in The First Step.Bravo to everyone involved for making an incredibly poignant and memorable political documentary that will be discussed for many years to come.",False
19,9,Required viewing for these polarized times,timothycsun,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a beautiful, moving, insightful look at how the sausage really gets made in these polarized times. Van Jones is the central figure, but this not hagiography. The story is much larger, and the filmmakers' ambitions far greater than simply profiling an individual. They have their camera trained on the divisions that have come to characterize not just our politics but our very sense of self -- and also the resounding good that can come from transcending those divisions.The film is not at all didactic or bombastic. It's a gentle film, filled with empathy, humor, and, most crucially, optimism. With the remarkable access the filmmakers got to the White House, and particularly to Jared Kushner, they could have taken a mocking, flippant tone, but they do not -- Kushner, as much as Jones, is depicted by the film as a human being first, and at least in this instance, pushing for change that will deliver real help to thousands of Americans. The same open-hearted view of people and politics is on full display in the sequences showing Jones brings together black West coast activists and white West Virginian Trump supporters. Commonalities quickly override differences, friendships and mutual purpose form, and we get to see -- for once -- Red America and Blue America actually talk to each other.This film is, if not an antidote, at least a tonic for the daily tribal warfare that defines us. Do yourself a favor and watch it.",False
20,9,Year from now we will look back at this film as a playbook on how to work across the isle in politics!,seekerfilms,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think the filmmakers did an excellent job of capturing this time period, the struggles that Van faced internally and externally, and most of all capturing so many key human moments. I can't imagine how difficult this story was to tell with all the footage and all the moments and they grabbed just enough of each moment to touch us without going too far afield.More importantly, the filmmakers remind us of how important it is to work across the isle no matter how difficult. Are there problems with how it was done, maybe, but if Trump is re-elected or someone of a similar bent in 2024, we will all be looking back at this film trying to figure out how to make lemonade out of a terrible situation. With gerrymandering, massive voter supression and the fillibuster we may very well have a Repulican back in office in 2024. We need to not only organize to stop this and put forth an agenda that helps all Americans, but we also ned to have a back up plan which this film gives us insight into.",False
21,10,The sort of storytelling that could save us,mignonlamia,n/a,16/08/2025,"At a time when few people seem willing to consider the humanity of those on the other side of the aisle, debate stage, or multipartisan dinner table, this film shows how it's done - and why it must be done. It does this in the story it tells and in how it's told. Hats off to the filmmakers who tackled complex issues and complex characters with respect and humility.",False
22,10,Excellent film!,samuelryan-29902,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film was wonderful to experience and I took away a deeper understanding for the work that went into passing the First Step Act and the complex navigating Van and the Cut50 leadership had to do. The film really made the federal legislative process understandable and relatable for people who are not ""politicos"". That is a very hard thing to do. This is a film that should be shown in every political science/policy development course!",False
23,10,Watched it twice at two different fests! Recommend!,cristos_thekid,n/a,16/08/2025,There is much to see and much that can be missed on first watch. The film offers an up close look at politics today while uncovering complicated news cycle culture and handles with grace avenues towards healing at a time when it's needed most.,False
24,10,Thoughtful and well made,kieleyparker,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really enjoyed this film. I thought that it was incredibly well made and really portrayed an important topic. I have not seen many films that so accurately and honestly portray the divide happening in America right now, and I thought the film captured those nuances. Definitely a film to watch and discuss.",False
25,10,Come Together,Bazin,n/a,16/08/2025,"This fantastic documentary put me through the wringer. I was provoked, frustrated, depressed, amused, and sad. But in the end, it made me hopeful. Van Jones is the central figure but the film isn't just a profile piece. It's a timeless story about how people of differing views need to come together to solve problems and move things forward. This spirit of collaboration is what our country needs now. See this film and be inspired.",False

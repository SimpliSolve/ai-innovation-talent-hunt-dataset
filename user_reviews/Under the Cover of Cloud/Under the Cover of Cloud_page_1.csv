1,n/a,Saving grace,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I few nights ago my wife had gone away on a girls trip to Newcastle. I had been left with my two children aged 8 and 13 with nothing in the house but a slab of crown larger and a family sized frozen lasagna from coles. I was running out of ideas to keep the children entertained and I could see them growing more unruly by the minute. With no ace up my sleeve I turned to the television. I stumbled across this movie and sweet talked my children into watching it with me. Within a matter of minutes they had fallen asleep because they had Buckley's chance in keeping up with the dialogue. I couldn't thank Ted Wilson enough for creating one of Australia's best unknown films. Not only did it pull me out of hot water with my offspring, it also ensured I got the last slice of lasagna.",False
2,3,Don't waste your time,pub-21,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unless you have a very particular interest in something to do with this film don't waste your time.
It's like a movie length reality tv show about an uninteresting man for a short period of a mostly boring life.
Acting, directing & camera work all very average.
Wouldn't dream of recommending it and would never waste my time watching again.",False
3,1,What's this?,john-cruzazul,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why did somebody thought this was a movie? This is literally the fake movie they show in the Mr. Bean movie about a guy, that filmed himself, wrote himself the script (if there's any script). Literally this guy just filmed himself, with his family, without any interesting things that happen to him.",False
4,1,Woeful,phillipbhey,n/a,16/08/2025,Self indulgent twaddle. Not a movie. Just a rambling waste of time.,False
5,7,Vanilla Slice With Pike,rosalinda-80791,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the car chase in the opening sequences, made ever more riveting by the Fairmont bypassing the Valiant in opposite directions, each sensibly sticking to their lane and to the suburban Tassie speed limit, Under the Cover of Cloud is one gripping film. For mine, this is as riveting as cricket any tick of the clock. Even features a cricketer. And mentions Mr Bloomin' Marvellous himself, Peter Cundle. Bless individuality. This is a true original. (Senior female Wilson lights up the camera. She's the light and life of this quiet little gem.)",False
6,2,Incredibly dull,grantss,n/a,16/08/2025,"After losing his job in Melbourne, Ted returns to his hometown of Hobart, Tasmania, to spend some time with his family. While there he decides to write a non-fiction book on Tasmanian top-order Test batsmen. First on his list is a man who lives in Hobart and who he is keen to meet, the legendary David Boon.I watched this because I love Test cricket and the basic plot seemed interesting enough. Turns out this is far more a documentary rather than drama, which shouldn't necessarily be a death blow for it. What does sink this though is that it is incredibly boring.We basically have 90 or so minutes of home movies and Ted and his family are not at all interesting. It's like being stuck at a dinner party where every subject that comes up is extremely dull yet is discussed at length and in depth. Much of it is also just day-to-day domestic life of your average person, which in general is not exciting. There's a reason screenwriters get paid heaps to write the scripts for movies...David Boon does eventually make an appearance but even that scene is fairly bland.On the plus side, if you're looking for a cure for insomnia, this is it.",False
7,7,Family portrait of Australian life.,JestaCat,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had little expectation coming in to UNDER THE COVER OF CLOUD; not particularly being a cricket fan - but as a fan of Australian cinema I decided to dive in.I admit, I checked the remaining time a few times through the viewing, not so much that I was bored but I wondered had I given it enough time to get to the point...The point was more that I was looking too hard, the substance in this film isn't ""story"", it's heart and character. Forget the cricket sub-plot (it's not clear the book ever eventuated), this is a touching portrait of Australian family life. I'm sure these people have their trials too, but that isn't what we needed to see here.Notwithstanding a few conversations about cricket, and a nice chat with a cricket legend; this is a loving document for the Wilson family to cherish.",False
8,9,I loved this film.,mischabaka,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this film. The intimacy and candour of the characters feels very genuine. The domestic duties, small exchanges of stories, humour and entertainments of the central family are captivating in their commonality and strangeness. It's less like any other film and more like meeting in laws for the first time. The performances have the quirks and rhythms of meeting with real people, somehow captured on film.
In amongst all the domestic moments I could sense a fragility, perhaps just the fragility of life perceptible when we are allowed that intimacy with people. Perhaps this is the drama of the film, in response to that fragility I found myself concerned for the main character and his family, and I cherished each little clue that spoke of the things that bound this man and his family together and gave them purpose.",False
9,10,In it for the matriarchs.,danielle-phibbs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Despite being a 'mainlander', I thoroughly enjoyed this film about an endearing (read: mildly clueless) writer struggling to find his story between the mundane and sweet moments of everyday family life. Mother Colleen and sister Jesse steal the show, making the viewer feel like they're at home with their classic (read: mildly morbid) stories and wonderful senses of humour. Would recommend to anyone looking for a heartfelt and grounding film experience. Few too many chickens for my liking though.",False
10,n/a,Check Out the Clouds,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"What makes this film great is the inclusion of the apparently extraneous detail in which the narrative appears to conceal its intent, as though 'under the cover of cloud'.For those who are likewise interested in how human beings authentically interact with one another on a genuine day to day level, that viewer will be rewarded if they make a little space in their life for the couple of hours that this gentle and subtle film expands to cover.Ignore the reviews here that seem to reel back in an overtly critical, chokingly ignorant, cultural cringe overdose, and as such, miss the point completely as to what this film is about and for what purpose it serves to better the human race.Of course, a film of this type is not going to please those who expect their cinema to excite and titillate the senses to the point of nervous evisceration, but to the average human being, seeking to experience the simple, unique human interactions of, and connection to, a small islander community in as close to an utter naturalism as any fictionalised film might conjure, it is a triumph as a genre breaking, (uniquely Tasmanian) work, apparently easily capturing a rare form of authenticity and realism, achieved with skillful artifice.The naturalism in each scene serves as a triumph of the cinematic art, captured as though a clandestinely shot documentary one can imagine being presented later to the 'actors' as a surprise to each of them and in that sense its content may be confronting, mystifying and alien to the majority of viewers expecting traditional 'players'.As an aside, as a Tasmanian myself, I can well see in the naturalism of the anthropological feature, the 'traditional Tasmanian islander banter stye of conversation', which in this sparsely inhabited island population serves as a defense mechanism ritual tool is subconsciously employed to identify other like minded types.This film's sense of place is intimately portrayed through visions of the Tasmanian landscape, mountains beaches and coastlines, sweeping hills and rarely a flat piece of ground, an unruly landscape impossible to tame, noted as malevolently imposing and threatening, under brooding skies and ever failing light, photographed in a manner only a well seasoned Tasmanian visionary might evaluate its subtleties.This film is paced precisely like a specifically Tasmania-centric story ought to be, that is, not speeding toward an obvious explosive cavalcade of climatic resolution but, like the passenger physically and symbolically leaving big city Sydney at the beginning on slow moving sea borne vessel, it is a departure from the standard fare of mainstream hurl-burly commercial film, instead existing as a segment pruned from something vastly more challenging to create, real life, and to some extent, as a new cinematic experience foreign to many, at times,it may prove challenging to watch. But then again, who ever said it had to always be easy?In its obscurity of style, tone, pace, place and character, and by including and encapsulating naturalistically the apparently extraneous details of the location and culture in which it was made it eloquently conceals its narrative intent, successfully revealing with base authenticity, the little seen or experienced 'Tasmanian way of life', something necessarily obscure and alien to the majority. Succinctly, it thereby successfully encapsulates, on an intimately personal level, what constitute our most meaningful and valuable experiences in life. Great Art may reflect what it is to be human, and in doing that with a quietly reserved gusto, this film qualifies as superb.",False

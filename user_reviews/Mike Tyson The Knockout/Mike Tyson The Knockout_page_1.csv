1,7,Iron Mike,bgar-80932,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI don't think this was anything new but I'm a sucker for boxing and in particular stuff about Tyson. He's one of the more interesting athletes ever for me. I didn't know the part about Teddy Atlas pulling a gun on him but other than that it was just fun to relive the Tyson rollercoaster.,True
2,7,"Good doc of Mike's life, not enough boxing or boxers",crazelord,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a portrait of the big events that shaped the public persona of Mike Tyson, this is probably the best we've gotten so far. Mike being such an interesting person who seemed half unstoppable killing machine and half hurt child it does paint a pretty in depth and entertaining story.It feels like an account of Mike from the perspective of a fan or people who grew up when Mike was one of the most famous people in the world. And while it shows the negative sides to him it does generally portray him sympathetically, which I get even though I think he was mostly a pretty bad person in the 90s.But not much of this is about his actual bouts. This is very clear with who they have in the interviews. Either due to inability to get them or the series having different focus, most interviews about him are accounts from people auxiliary to Mike and auxiliary to boxing. There are barely any interviews, and those they have are short, are from people who actually fought Mike.And it kind of takes me out of bc he's one of the best to ever compete yet it doesn't feel like actual boxing fans or critics were involved in making this. Tbf most of Mike's fights ended in the first couple of rounds but there are Youtube channels that can make long engrossing videos just focusing on his actual fights and techniques.Though I give it a lot of credit how it focused on his rappe conviction and how the media and society demonized the victim. It actually exposed me more to those events than I knew before and it's pretty messed up how significantly more people were upset about an ear than a young girl being sexually assualted.Overall it's a good doc but I'd suggest watching videos on his fighting career if you really want to see why he was so feared and famous, as they're still some of the most hard hitting boxing matches of all time.",False

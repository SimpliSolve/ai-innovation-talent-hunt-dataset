1,7,Love behind bars.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Staff at a corrections facility are shocked to learn that their colleague, Vicky White, a stalwart of the facility has fallen in love with an inmate, Casey White, and helped him to escape.What an absolutely crazy story, talk about an unexpected love story. It's a very well made, intriguing storyline, well made, interesting and surprising, with some fascinating interviews.I had a feeling it would have a tragic ending, and it really does, what a way for this story to end, a tragedy.It doesn't seem as though Casey was a particularly good guy, he wouldn't have ended up where he did I guess, but what on Earth was Vicky thinking, what a crazy risk to take. One thing that seems obvious, they fell for eachother.One question I came away with, is nobody monitoring those phone calls inside the prison? Surely someone would have clocked the sheer volume of calls?7/10.",False
2,7,Vicky: Not as Innocent as She Seems,perlshop,n/a,15/08/2025,"So, I watched ""Jailbreak Love on the Run"" and, let me tell you, I'm swimming against the tide here. Vicky? Not exactly a damsel in distress. She knew the ropes and was well aware of the rules she was flouting, which could have landed her in hot water. And Casey? He wasn't just along for the ride. The documentary, in my opinion, didn't lay all the cards on the table. If they had been keeping an eye on things like they should have, this whole caper would have been shut down early. And seriously, who's ever heard of anyone being allowed out of uniform? No way.Now, let's dive into the behind-the-scenes antics. This could have been stopped so early if people were actually doing their jobs. Red flags were popping up like crazy, and yet, nothing. The documentary made it clear there were some serious management issues. We didn't hear from many perspectives, which makes me wonder if some people kept quiet out of fear of retaliation. Wouldn't surprise me one bit.So, in conclusion, this documentary needed more expansion and less ""let's gloss over the juicy bits.""",False
3,7,Life Imitating Art,DVK1234,n/a,15/08/2025,"I would not believe that this could actually happen in the prison system but here you have it. Vicky White, who has a senior position at the jail, falls in love with Casey White, a dangerous offender who is looking at 75 years imprisonment and has now confessed to another murder.This woman is obviously lonely and vulnerable as she gets taken in by her prisoner because he tells her that she has a nice butt. From there, they begin an intimate relationship in the prison; it's astounding to me that they are never caught. It seems like the other prisoners in this overcrowded cell are aware of what's going on, but the staff are completely ignorant to it.This love she has for her Casey will cost her dearly.I'm perplexed as to why women guards are even in the male prison system. It does seem dangerous, especially if some of the prisoners are violent and require maximum security.Interesting story that almost seems to outrageous to be true and I'm sorry that the ending turned out the way it did. Glad that Netflix didn't drag this out and make it into a limited series.I recommend.",False
4,6,Love Or Manipulation?,Foutainoflife,n/a,15/08/2025,Not an awful documentary but strangely portrays the situation as a Romeo and Juliet meets Bonnie and Clyde love story.I don't doubt that Vicky White cared deeply for Casey but I can't believe Casey reciprocated her feelings.Casey White is a manipulator. He found a weakness in Vicky that he used in an attempt to get him out spending the rest of his life in prison. People like him are skilled in finding the most vunerable and know how to play the game.I think it is a tragedy that Vicky's legacy as a steller employee was completely ruined the instant she gave in to her emotions. She simply should've known better.Decent documentary.,False
5,7,A Tragic Tale of Passion and Prison Break,Anry7,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary offers a fascinating perspective from both the inmates and corrections officers who interacted with Casey White, an inmate, and Vicky White, a corrections officer.The show provides some insight into Vicky White's life and character before her relationship with Casey White began, painting a picture of her personality and motivations. The series also highlights the vulnerabilities within the correctional system, particularly concerning the dynamics of male and female interactions behind bars, which played a pivotal role in their escape.It's a heartbreaking watch, especially if you're unfamiliar with the story and the tragic outcome of their escape and time on the run. The documentary sheds light on the consequences of a system with loopholes and the complexities of human emotions that led to their dramatic downfall. I felt that the documentary could have highlighted a bit more on the interactions between the inmate and the officer, as well as some of the more information regarding the case since some of the information that was released after their capture.",True
6,7,Love knows no rules and regulations,madanmarwah,n/a,15/08/2025,"Love does make you do the weird, wild and unthinkable things. It seems love is not just blind, it numbs your mind too. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction. This true story has more excitement and suspense than a fictitious thriller.How else can you explain a lady officer of a correctional facility getting friendly and falling in love with a much younger inmate who is in prison on a charge of murder. A case of fence eating grass. Worse how can this lady plan to run away with him in order to settle down with him in some remote location.With years of experience in procedures of the law did she not realize that this escapade would end in their arrest not to speak of the shame it would bring to all concerned ?The movie keeps you riveted throughout even though the narrative is in an unconventional format with extensive use of CCTV footage with faces blurred. The voice over and the storyline is well done keeping the suspense live.",False
7,7,Sad story,d_penn,n/a,15/08/2025,"On April 29, 2022, Vicky took Casey out of his cell to transport him to the nearby courthouse. Or, rather, that's what she claimed she was doing; instead, she and Casey got into her vehicle and vanished. By the time her fellow corrections officers realized what was going on, the duo was long gone. This was stunning to everyone, including Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office investigator Sgt. Matt Burbank, who had known Vicky for years and, like everyone else, immediately feared she might be in danger. However, upon finding her abandoned car and searching her home, he quickly deduced that she wasn't a victim but an accomplice. Before long, Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton was appearing on television to spread the word about this crime to the public, all as a U. S. Marshals team led by commander Chad Hunt initiated an urgent manhunt.",False
8,6,Pure Rationalization,dv727,n/a,15/08/2025,"I gave the movie 6 stars because of its investigation into events, the interviews with people related to it, and the integration of film from the events themselves. As far as the ""story"" goes, there was little if anything good I could say about it. Painting Ms. White as a ""victim of love"" took any credibility from the documentary itself. Painting Mr, White, a manipulative criminal as someone who may have sincerely ""loved"" Ms. White was equally ridiculous. In short, these two were a criminal who was completely amoral and lacking any conscience, and someone so wrapped up in herself she violated the law and endangered society by assisting a monster escape back into society.The only regret is that only one of them died.",False
9,7,Fools love,kosmasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well no pun intended - you know the saying about who falls in love - or is it the song? I know Elvis sang about it. But while you could add Jailhouse Rock (to round up what the documentary also entails), let's dive into what this is about - although I reckon I made it clear.So depending on your sensibilities and what you personally believe (morals may have to take a backseat) ... we get to see an unusual love story. I am not sure what the whole bad boy charm is though one could argue it may not apply 100% in this case. Well some women seem to want ""rescue"" men ... they see the good in them. Anyway this is another case of that, but since its a documentary you get to learn the ""real"" persons behind it all ... well done, researched and edited.",False
10,4,Dishonest Portrayal,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,15/08/2025,"Vicky was certainly experienced enough in her position- having worked there for over seventeen years- portraying her as some simpleton that was merely looking for love and fell for the wrong guy is disingenuous, at best. There's a lot of excusing of stupidity here, and if the roles were reversed i sincerely doubt we would see a male guard portrayed so sympathetically or as an innocent who was merely led astray by a predator. Casey is definitely preying on her vulnerability, but as an employee surrounded by men every second of her working day (50-60 hours her WEEK) one would think the need for fortifications and reinforcements in place to ensure this was not even a possibility. There should never be any vulnerability to exploit, and one should never be acting as some sort of 'surrogate' of a mother or worse, a lover, for inmates with nothing to lose and everything to gain by exploiting these employees. I understand sympathy, or even empathy, but that's what those incarcerated are looking for- a way in. Even if there isn't ill-intent on behalf of the inmate, you're becoming a loophole for them. Just as the inmate interviewed talked about trying to ferret out those who threatened to out the affair, he expressed anger over her not being able to be his 'mommy figure'. That is absolutely not her job, and that should never be something expressed to these inmates. That she was constantly going out of her way for her favorite inmates or that of her 'boyfriend' says everything wrong with this entire debacle.One has to wonder in what type insanity would you ever have an opposite sex employee that oversees so much of the daily goings on? The entire reason she was able to escape the view of her coworkers and/or superiors is because she was responsible for so much of every facet of the facility. Even if opposing sexes are needed, more oversight is absolutely necessary and should be mandatory; the checks and balances didn't even exist here and nobody could see past their own duties to even consider this a vague possibility. There's absolutely no way Vicky wasn't just as culpable, and maybe even more so. Someone has to be the adult in the room or we're looking at mass chaos of the highest order.It wasn't an unbearable watch, but there were portions far too incredulous to digest. Far too many people placed far too much confidence in someone who was, what seems to be, merely abflattering compliment away from an incredibly felonious act with zero regard for the path of wreckage left in her wake.",False
11,8,Fifty Shades of White,ninazachej,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerGiiiiirl just took him right trought the front door.Very well made documentary. Entertaining I must say. They break it down very well, its organized well I like it.They were lid for that pot she knew the system he was criminal, boom match made in heaven. But until when?Also... Dont get me wrong, but Woman as a male prison director.. I dont know, I am women myself but one day or another emotions get in the way... after so many years in her position she gave in to compliments, fell in love with criminal. He knew what he was doing he wanted to go out and she trusted him, his words, his promises.I am not judging but she was so naive.... She was lonely and he knew that.But she should know better, you dont trust a criminal. Unfortunately.",True
12,1,Pseudoporn disguised as a documentary,bethelabba-553-227653,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't know who's bright idea it was to garnish this alleged documentary with every sex-phone-call these two idiots engaged in, but it really shameful towards the director and Netflix for publishing this garbage.I'm not a prude, but this tasteless trash is hardly entertaining and a sure waste of the money they invested into making it. Honestly, the director of this should be barred from ever making another documentary for his/her entire life. They honestly don't understand the medium.I love crime dramas, and was really set to sit down and enjoy this. After 40 minutes I'd had enough and turned it off. I found better retellings of this story done by amateurs on YouTube. Save your time.... watch something else.",False
13,8,Rooted for Vicky.,UltraNeptuneCat,n/a,15/08/2025,"I dont care about the guy, no. He deserved to be in there. I cared only about Vicky, she worked tirelessly in a prison with stinky and violent men. Great employees. I get why she broke free and gambled on a guy to help her be wild and free and on the run for about a week. She needed someone who spent time with her, it should of been a friend who could help her retire and meet someone but I think she was depressed and workaholic with constantly needing to answer calls about work.No, I don't think she was innocent in not knowing what she was doing or whatever these reviews are saying about innocent or inexperience.But was she overworked by this prison system, and probably underpaid and her mental state took a hit and it made her develop a voice in the back of her head to take a life ruining risk and she was tired of everything and caring.",False

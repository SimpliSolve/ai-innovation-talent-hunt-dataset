1,6,Overview Of Inclusion In Marvel Comics,deepfrieddodo,n/a,16/08/2025,"A comprehensive documentary that explores the inclusion of minorities in the Marvel universe without contributing anything new to the topic. Well represented by those within the industry, there are few big hitters or household names sharing their views, even by comic book fan standards.Behind The Mask provides a good historical overview of the introduction of different races, religions, genders and sexualities into the Marvel universe, and finds a good mix of praise whilst still calling out some of the more problematic decisions made on former characters and plots. The difficulty with that is there are a number of more contemporary writers highlighting these issues whilst patting themselves on the back for their more inclusive characters (which quite often a significantly less popular).It's a cool comic book history, which also isn't afraid to bash DC Comics when the opportunity presents itself too.",False
2,8,"If there was one thing my father (Jack Kirby) did not like, it was bullies",TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"This consists of interviews with writers, artists, people inspired by the comics, who study them, all of whom have something compelling to add within their area of expertise(and there is a very clear love of what they're working on or fascinated by), panels, clips from the subjects, behind-the-scenes and documentary footage, and incomplete effects shots.It's 65 minutes long. This is found on Disney+. It spoils a lot of the comics, but this review doesn't.They talk about Stan Lee's Definition of the ideal Marvel character: we get to know who they are, it's not just someone in spandex jumping off a building. How they help us figure out the world. The opportunity for interesting social narratives. Depicting someone alienated trying to fit in. Exploring identity: it's not about hiding yourself, it's about uncovering yourself. Several of the original creators being Jewish, and having to hide that side of themselves, wanting to be accepted as American. Identifying with The Thing, if you stand out visually, and are always judged by your appearance before being seen as who you actually are. The supposed monster inside being redeemable. The 60s introducing psychology. Peter Parker at times being more interesting than Spider-Man. DMC using rap to create an alter ego. Being inclusive before there was pressure to do so, because there actually were non-whites around. The Fantastic Four responding to seeing Black Panther's skin colour with acceptance, tolerance, after he kicks their ass, after they defeated Galactus. The offices treated the women and various races working there well. Luke Cage didn't wear a mask, because they wanted everyone to know right away, that this hero was black. They acknowledge problematic aspects. Moving away from ugly stereotypes. Taking tropes and turning them upside down. Putting T'Challa in Reconstruction. The heroines having lesser superpowers, until it was addressed with the creation of feministic Ms Marvel, wearing Gloria Steinem glasses out of costume, editor of Woman magazine... though, of course, the costume was basically a bathing suit. Making the X-Men international, instead of just a bunch of Caucasian dudes. Nightcrawler embracing his appearance. Switching genders. Northstar coming out, and the plan changing from him dealing with AIDS, to him being half fairy. Making them interesting, not just tokens. Introducing Miles Morales, through tragic circumstance. Giving Carol a relatable background. Assembling a dark-skinned superteam to help during Hurricane Katrina. Kamala Khan imitating Danvers' appearance, subconsciously.I recommend this to any fan of the medium. 8/10.",False
3,3,Misleading film,wilyhawk,n/a,16/08/2025,"At 20 minutes into the movie, they mention that in the 60s they had people of color and different religions all mixed together, ""And not in a token way... there are people of all types in the world we live in."" Not forced but naturally.Then the last half of the film talks about making sure to put in every type of person to make sure they're represented, exactly opposite of the point made earlier.",False

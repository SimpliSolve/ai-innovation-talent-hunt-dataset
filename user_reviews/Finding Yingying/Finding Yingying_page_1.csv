1,5,Interesting documentary but left out a lot,samoanui,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an interesting documentary but it did leave out some pertinent facts, perhaps intentionally.The documentary mentions that perhaps Brendt went after Yingying because she is Asian and meek. Why didn't they mention that he also tried to abduct a girl earlier that day and that girl was a blonde blue-eyed American girl? Seems them divulging that would go against the political narrative.They also failed to mention that Brendt's wife left on a trip with her lover the day of the abduction and took him to the same resort/hotel as she spent with Brendt for their honeymoon. While this of course doesn't absolve Brendt of guilt in the murder of Yingying, it does shed light on to why he started developing psychological issues for which he sought treatment, and why he abducted and killed a girl that day.There are countless other omissions and I can't but feel at least some of them were intentional.",False
2,5,Followed The Family's Journey,fayandray,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is an emotional documentary, which is to be expected. I didn't expect to follow the family instead of the investigation, though.Honestly, there were private family moments I wish were left to themselves, as I didn't feel right being an audience to it. Also, I wish there was more context regarding Chinese culture. As an Asian American myself, there are comments at which I understood were made culturally (I.e. Grandparents), but felt extremely offended by as an American. I'm not sure what the point in including some of that without context. I could see it being off putting to a western viewer.Ultimately, I was looking for a documentary about the investigation. This was not it. It's about remembering YingYing and following her family's journey through the ordeal. My favorite parts were learning about all that the killer's ex-gf did to bring him to justice and her reading a letter to the family in Mandarin. Those were my favorite moments because it was the first I'd heard of them.This is the weakest of the (shockingly good) MTV docs that are out on Paramount+. It's is the type of doc that make me feel bad for viewing true crime as entertainment. I gave it a 5 for decent production values and sentiment.",True

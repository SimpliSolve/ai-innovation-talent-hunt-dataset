1,10,One of Ours will Yank at your Heartstrings,alexandradenton,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of Ours is a touching insight into the struggles of intersectional identity. It questions what it means to belong, and who is entitled to claim what labels and communities.The adoption story, questions around racial identity, indigeneity, family, culture, LBGT relationships, and the struggles of Josiah navigating it all will make you feel deeply and compassionately about things you may have never understood before.It gives a rare glimpse into the heart of a tight-knit community and family, the family followed in the documentary being very vulnerable with the biases and hurt they have struggled with as well as the positivity and love they share. Overall, a great and enlightening watch.",False

3,10,A Heartfelt Film About Embracing Culture and Family,vivianacostante,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found this film to be both informative and heartfelt. The film took the audience through an extremely emotional and heartfelt journey that highlighted themes such as racial differentiation, unconditional love, and acceptance. I appreciated the various perspectives that were explored throughout the contents of the film. The ways in which the Indigenous community were shown to be strong and united allowed the audience to gain deeper connection for the family and their story.

4,10,Phenomenal Film in Discussing the Important Issues On Racial and Ethnic Differences,dreyermiya,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film was breathtaking. The importance of ethnic, cultural and racial divisions were highlighted throughout the film. This film captured the familial importances and connections from both Josiah Wilsons life and his family's; having the indigenaity and support from his culture, but also the negative impacts members of the community of the unsupportive side from the racial v ethnicity/culture.The film shedded much needed light to the discrimination people endure when there race and ethnicity do not ""traditionally"" align. The Wilson family discusses that to be apart of their indigenous community is not just blood, it is more, it is involvement, passion and love.",False
5,10,A documentary that is as insightful asd it is emotional,gedbaron,n/a,15/08/2025,"The question of what it means to belong to a community is not easy for everyone to answer. Most people grow up and live without understanding how it can even be a problem.This film is about Josiah, an adopted young man from Haiti who has clear links to his Heiltsuk community, yet they get questioned by an ""authority"" that should not even be able to have anything to say about his being part of his grandfather's and father's Indigenous community.The film gives great, detailed insight into the emotions and pain this thoughtless decision causes, the family's support, and the needless struggle to heal which lasts years.Everyone should watch this film - those who have questioned their identity and (especially) those who never have.",False
6,9,An Insightful Look into Identity,alexismcdonough-38144,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of Ours provides a unique, insightful perspective into what it means to be a part of a people, and whether there is a set definition or limitations to such a thing (and, further, who gets to dictate them).The film is a profound look into what an ""identity"" means -- as something that one doesn't have to be explicitly born into, but something that develops on the basis of community and kinship. It presents the challenges that some people face based on unfair assumptions and narratives about the nature of identity. For example, the idea that it is only a result of their blood, which leaves out whole groups of people with unique experiences like Josiah.It is a heartfelt story of Josiah and his family, and presents the complexities of things like transracial adoption, community, aspects of identity, and acceptance.",False
7,10,One of Ours Review: A Touching Exploration of Identity.,nataliehelenyoung,n/a,15/08/2025,"""One of Ours"" follows Josiah Wilson, a Haitian-born Heiltsuk French Canadian youth adopted into a Calgary Indigenous family. The film explores Josiah's experience at an Indigenous basketball tournament that challenges his sense of belonging. The movie explores themes of community, acceptance, love, betrayal, and resilience, offering a touching story about identity. By exploring Josiah's journey, dealing with adoption, family issues, and the tournament the movie helps us to broaden our understanding of identity and the positive impact of finding acceptance within one's community. I highly recommend ""One of Ours"" for its touching exploration of identity.",False
8,9,A thoughtful insight to the complexities of Adoption and Identity,avalonjshort,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of Ours, paints the complex reality of adopting transracially, alongside the realities of expressing indigenous identities. The story is put together in raw, intimate way. Getting to know this family, and their many nations was a privilege watching this film. You will learn much about forgiveness, betrayal, and the hardships of family, kinship, and blood.The film leaves you longing for a feeling of belonging. You should watch this film if you are curious about personal perspectives of transracial adoption. This film also has some VERY poignant points about indigenous identity, who and what decides who you are?Is it a drop of blood or is it a life of knowledge and participation in a people and nationhood.",False
9,10,An Outstanding Film Tackling Important and Intersecting Issues,danieljpvoth,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is outstanding. The work brings together complex issues of Indigenous identity, Indigenous sovereignty, kinship, and race. The film deftly navigates questions of belonging at the centre of Josiah Wilson's experience, and creates important space for having a conversation about what it means to be Indigenous, and what it means to be a member of the nation.The work presented here is particularly important in light of the discussion of Indigenous identity claims in the national Canadian media. The film offers a much more nuanced intervention into what adoption means, and how it is woven into long-standing Indigenous legal systems.",False
10,10,A Valuable Perspective on the Complexity of Family,isabellafrey,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of Ours eloquently describes the intersections between racial prejudice and colonization. It highlights the complexity of real families, demonstrating how an objective blood quantum or legal status simply does not hold the depth to accurately represent human relationships. Just as our belonging to a family unit can be complex and personal, so can a larger belonging to a community. Josiah's story makes this reality tangible and approachable, and the film successfully displays his important role within the Heiltsuk community.The film supports an important dialogue around the legitimacy of social relations, and the dangers of politicizing relationships within local communities.",False
11,10,This documentary was fantastic,lauriemitchell-00278,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is an incredible look at identity, and how people are viewed within both their communities and by people outside the communities who want to exercise unnecessary power over people.The way this movie displays identity is quite interesting as it discusses adoption and how Josiah's identity is influenced by being adopted into the nation, and his family structure. This is a wonderful documentary, and it is deeply heartfelt. One of my key takeaways from this is that identity is about nationhood, and the people with whom you grow up with, and live with. It then looks at what happens when that identity is unfairly challenged, and the betrayal that comes with it. This a film in which you become invested in the people that are being discussed. I would definitely recommend watching it!",False

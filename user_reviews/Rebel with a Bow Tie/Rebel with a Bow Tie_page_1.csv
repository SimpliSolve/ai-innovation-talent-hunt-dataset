1,8,"""Rebel with a Bow Tie"" - a public hidden camera film that shows but doesn't tell",Rauno_Uusleer,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Rebel with a Bow Tie"" is an authentic and compelling documentary. Although it reflects events that took place many years ago, its impact and value are still felt today. The character of President Ilves had already attracted attention during his time in office, but this film revives the side of him we imagined as president - humorous, emotional and sharply spoken.The film is the work of Jaan Tootsen, then the president's advisor on culture, whose position gave him a unique opportunity to capture the behind-the-scenes of the country's most important office and institution. This intimate access allowed him to convey a genuine atmosphere, rather than an official communication that had been edited and half-staged for the screen.Often in similar documentaries there is an attitude of 'behave now, we are being filmed', but I did not notice it here. This is probably because, at the time of filming, few of those involved believed that this footage would one day be made into a full documentary.If there was one thing I missed, it was the unveiling of private influences and backgrounds. While the structure of the film - assembled as if from a secret camera - added to the originality of the story, it left questions unanswered. Looking back on this period, keywords like the HÃ¤rma farm and the Evelin scandal inevitably come to mind first. The impact of these difficult moments on the president and his immediate family was either not touched by the movie at all, or was portrayed rather modestly.",False

2,9,Inspiring!,anjanaachal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Such an empowering documentary!
Gray is just another color and society need to know that the grevolution has begun. Gray no more means Old. Women of all ages and cultures are on their way to embrace their natural gray hair. Society must support and encourage this cause to ditch the harmful chemicals that women have been putting in on their hair to fit in the society norms. It's a fantastic piece of art that every woman willing to give up hair dye must watch,",False

They set an example for all of us to be secure in who we are and not let society's beliefs prevail on our actions and decisions. I applaud this film crew and the cast for making such an incredible film showcasing women's strength. It is without reservation that I recommend this film.,False
4,9,This movie inspired me to let the real me out,sandymccathie-60559,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerEducational, enjoyable and practical too.
Finding ourselves and living our authentic selves is an ongoing journey, perhaps I was ready for this film, because I'm in!
The persuasion I needed to say, 'Yes, I have a damn good reason for letting my grays shine through'. And, it is not at all about letting myself go. For me, it's about honouring aging in women, and honouring myself as I am.",True

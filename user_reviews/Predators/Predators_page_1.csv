1,8,Why Don't You Have Seat Over There?,peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWatched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.A fascinating documentary that discusses about the controversial show ""To Catch a Predator"" behind the scenes, the morality, and some of the disturbing natures about reality and the show itself. Director David Osit doesn't shy away from exploring about the show behind the scenes, and the impact the show has done with society, whether both positive and negative towards society. Exploring some skin-crawling footage that triggers people due to it's sensitive and predatory topics and how the show works with it's production and logistics.It truly dives deep into some of the disturbing nature of how predators are out there, how the decoy's are worked behind the scenes, and some of the effects it has done to society.Osit also offers a good point about how entertainment vs. Justice is an issue. As it discusses how people, due to the impact of the show, begin to form their ways of catching predators in the public. But the question about whether the creators are heroes or exploiting the subject and not actually helping the real victims. Do people really these days want to help those who have experienced sexual abuse or grooming or do they desire more of fame and social media clot for entertainment? These questions are lingered and it leaves a lasting impact to those who are affected and those who have grew up with the show.Overall, this is a good documentary that discusses the legacy of the show and the issues of justice and entertainment being intertwined in the worst ways.",True
2,10,Reflective,purplerocks-44667,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary goes into behind the scenes and some logistics of creating and producing ""To Catch a Predator"". They interviewed some of the people who played decoys, and we get to hear more about how these decoys were feeling at that time, and how they feel now. This includes the decoy that was used when a man killed himself. As one of my favourite shows to watch when I was growing up, it was very interesting learning about the behind the scenes of production with new footage showing not only different angles of the predators, but more of the production team both behind the scenes and coming onto camera for the sit down interview.",True

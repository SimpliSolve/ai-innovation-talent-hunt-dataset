1,7,Great for stans,ellyignatova,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film may not be the best documentary about a famous artist out there, BUT it's a truly special experience for fans - and honestly, that's what matters most.It was amazing to see so many fans featured, and you could really feel how grateful Eminem is for everything that's happened to him, despite never seeking fame in the first place.That said, I wish there had been more moments with him personally - showing places from iconic videos or talking about inspirations behind certain songs. I also really hoped we'd get to see Hailie and their relationship, which we all know is beautiful and so strong.""Mockingbird"" is my favorite song, and sadly it wasn't mentioned (aside from a brief fan comment).Still, the two hours flew by, and I know I could've easily watched two more.I was born in 2001, when Eminem was already a huge sensation. That didn't stop me from falling in love with every track, even the ones released before I was born. I've been listening to him since I was very young - at first without fully understanding anything.But after his darkest period (following Proof's death), when he came back with ""Not Afraid,"" that's when I truly became a fan.I've never been to one of his concerts, and I'm still waiting - beyond excited - for him to announce a tour. I know when that day comes, I'll die of happiness.",False
2,9,From person to be warned about to person to look upto,imdbfan-1340406413,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm seriously interested how they picked those STANS as they all were really well articulated and from different ageses and backgrounds. I hope they got to meet Eminem I just think they decided not to show it on screen as they don't want encourage STAN type behavior. I liked how they were empathetic towards Eminem and talked honestly how it resonated with them. It was a pleasant experience. And proof of that is that I didn't feel the need to look at my phone once.,False
3,9,"Very good , from a fan perspective",milosz1905-456-14218,n/a,16/08/2025,"We went in there with no expectations as this type of screening is not typical for a documentary. And it was not a typical documentary. It's more about how Eminem's struggles help others identify with his life and seek support in his music and fight with loss of someone close , though childhood , addiction, recovery .Fan.",False
4,10,Loved it,EmmaC-576,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just left the cinema - very good movie, there is a little bit of everything, nice summary of his career and impact and it's just very well leveled, I enjoyed it a lot. Just wish he'd shown the meeting with the Stans. I get why he didn't but vicariously I needed it man. Very interesting to watch the stories if his fans, a lot of it made me tear up.",False
5,10,"For me, best Documentary of 2025.",DARRENB-74,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent work. Very heartfelt and sincere. Couldn't ask for more. It was worth my time and money. Plan to watch again once released on Paramount plus. Theater was packed. Audience engaged and enthusiastic. Also, this documentary was very well done. Kudos to all involved. It's been a long time since I was in a theater. Thank you Marshall.",False
6,10,One of the best music docs!,DiegoL-272,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a big fan of music docs and this one was as good as any. Loved the unique twist on the story by making it about super fans. Very cool how they found so many interesting characters and eminem is of course fascinating.Would suggest to anyone who likes music docs, hip hop, 90s culture, or anything about human psychology and growth. Will stream it again when it's out.",False
7,10,Awesome documentary for us Stans,andersberlander,n/a,16/08/2025,"So cool to be in a packed cinema knowing everyone there has something in common. Super professional documentary that really hit emotionally at times, and there was a lot to relate to. My view of Eminem actually got even better after watching it - mad respect for the guy. Definitely recommend it!/Sweden.",False
8,7,There's a Slim Shady in all of us!,ta-98251,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stans is a limited theatrical release documentary that explores the lives of self-proclaimed Eminem superfans. The film offers a heartfelt and surprisingly uplifting look at fandom, focusing on how Eminem has positively impacted the lives of his most devoted followers.The documentary highlights their passion in a positive light whilst also discussing some of the negativity they've received. Some have Eminem tattoos, others dress like Eminem or travel around the world to see him perform but what unites them is the profound influence he's had on their lives. Many credit Eminem with helping them navigate personal struggles, using his music and story as a source of strength.While Stans isn't primarily a documentary about Eminem himself, it does trace key moments in his career to show how different eras of his music shaped and inspired his fans. The film features interviews with Eminem, Dr. Dre industry colleagues and celebrity stans like Ed Sheeran which adds a fun and insightful touch.As an Eminem fan, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the positive impact he's had on people from all walks of life especially considering how problematic some of his lyrics can be. The documentary is filled with nostalgic throwbacks and even a few singalongThough it may not be the kind of film you'd expect or even need to see in a cinema, I'm glad I experienced it on the big screen as it's a touching tribute to the power of music and connection.",False
9,10,Nostalgic And Exciting,jamesmcminnjr,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary did a good job of explaining Eminem's career to the biggest fan and an audience that has never heard of him. All done through the eyes of his Stans or fans. It was a fresh way to do an artist documentary. Eminem finally got his flowers and it didn't have to be narrated in a boring way. Great concept and they nailed the final product.,False
10,10,A heartfelt tribute to the bond between Eminem and his fans,watavualin,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you've been through life's ups and downs and found strength in Eminem's music, STANS will speak directly to you. This isn't just a documentary about an artist - it's about the impact his words and music have had on real people. It's raw, emotional, and honest. Even if Em only appears for a short time, the stories and emotions shared by his fans are powerful enough to carry the film. For anyone who's ever felt understood, inspired, or saved by his music, this is a must-watch.",False
11,2,truly rubbish,AlexC-2145,n/a,16/08/2025,"Was just about how some of his mentally-ill-struggling fans have used his music to get through tough times. Eminem himself was in the documentary for a solid 4 minutes. Rubbish. The defiant ones is better. Don't waste ur time.Every footage shown is already available on youtube, there was nothing unique at all. Was kinda sad for the stans, a pity party.",False
12,10,Stans & Eminem in Parallel,MatthewS-992,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie did an amazing job of telling Eminems story through the shared stories and experiences of his Stans, making it way more interesting than a regular artist documentary.It also delved into the psychology of how fans can delve further into becoming deeper Stans of an artist and also why that isn't necessarily ALWAYS a bad thing. Just like anything there can be positive aspects. I thought it did an amazing job of respecting the fans as well as Eminem and his legacy.",False
13,10,For Anyone Who's Ever Felt the Music,telmofreire,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary feels deeply personal. Marshall's music has been part of my life for so many years, guiding me through both the hardest and the brightest moments. Seeing these stories on screen is like watching pieces of my own life. If you've ever carried his words in your heart, you'll understand.",False
14,10,Excellent,afordalex,n/a,16/08/2025,Just brilliant all the way through. Eminem fans will really enjoy this.I've been listening since my first cassette as a kid and it's been enjoyable watching this. A lot of nostalgia and insight into the behind the scenes.Will definitely watch it all over again at some point in the future.I don't think there's much here for anyone not a fan of the music but then again that's not the target audience.,False
15,10,A Sensational Experience For Any Eminem Fan,ryanyazdanbakhsh,n/a,16/08/2025,"STANS is the best documentary I've ever seen. It took a completely fresh approach of giving the perspective of Eminem Stans, or superfans, as well as interviews from the man himself. The film did a beautiful job of telling Eminem's whole story in a way that was entertaining and never got boring. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I strongly recommend STANS for everyone, even if you're not the biggest Eminem fan, I think you'll still find it very enjoyable. Overall this was one of, if not THE, best movie experiences I've ever had. I will definitely be watching STANS again, once it comes to streaming.",False
16,9,Just farming,titiguri,n/a,16/08/2025,"""An engrossing and well-executed film that hooks you from the start and never lets go. The cast delivers compelling performances, the pacing keeps the story tight, and the visuals are stunning. It blends emotion, action, and depth seamlessly, leaving a powerful and lasting impression.""so it really was a nice piece.",False
17,10,Great movie!,oheaven33,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a long time Eminem fan, I had a wonderful time watching this at the cinema. It brought back a lot of great memories and the insights from other fans were really relatable. I was happy to see other celebrities taking part such as Dre, ll cool j, ed etc. I would recommend for anyone who likes Eminem and his music to give it a shot.",False
18,10,Brilliant,russelleric-74958,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stans is a gripping tribute to Eminem's enduring legacy, told through the eyes of his most passionate fans. With rare glimpses of the rapper himself and powerful fan stories, it shows how his music has inspired, healed, and shaped lives across generations. A must-watch for anyone who's ever been moved by his words.",False
19,10,Born Idol,Leilalalaaaa,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film interprets the significance of Eminem and his music to ordinary people from the perspective of Stans. It mainly shows how his music influenced and encouraged Stans at different stages of their lives. When they experienced family trauma/school bullying/lost close friends/drug addiction, only Em's songs helped them pick themselves up again. And when Em was going through all this, it was only himself who saved him. Such a person truly deserves to be called a born idol. However, Em's landmark works, such as 8mile, were merely glossed over, and the then-popular Love the way u lie and Venom were not mentioned at all. Just as Eminem said, people like me because they see themselves in me.",False
20,10,Awesome,JerichoJ-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very good documentary. For me, Em is one of those definitive artists that has locked their talent in the history books. I am from Michigan. Flint area. Being 52 myself, hip hop is a part of my upbringing. I remember the first time I heard Eminem. I was not sure what I was hearing. Now, in 2025, he is one of the greatest artists. Glad we still have him. I don't make music. I am simply a listener.",False

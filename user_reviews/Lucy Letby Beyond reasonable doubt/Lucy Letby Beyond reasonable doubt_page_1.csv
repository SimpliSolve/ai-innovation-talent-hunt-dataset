1,8,Stories about monsters,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"When neonatal deaths at a hospital in Chester started to rise, and investigation followed which eventually fingered Nurse Lucy Letby as a mass murderer. She is appealing the verdict, and although this documentary has clearly been made with the assistance of her (new) defence team, it's solidly put together and some serious questions are raised. A list shown to the jury, showing Letby present at every suspicious event, had in fact been filteted for those events she was present at; seemingly incriminating notes were only made after she had been accused; and the decision to send increasingly vulnerable babies to a unit ill-equipped to deal with them provides a natural explanation for their unfortunate deaths. It's also very strange that Letby's original defence team queried none of the medical evidence presented by the prosecution. I know there are some people who do terrible things, but the absence of obvious motive makes the story of guilt feel suspicious. Has she been convicted because we're just too keen to believe stories about monsters?",False

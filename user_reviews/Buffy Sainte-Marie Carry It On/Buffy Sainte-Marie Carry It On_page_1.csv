1,9,Must see movie,ermachum,n/a,16/08/2025,"An excellent portrait of the lifetime of lead women's rights and culture activist, one of the best song writers and singers of our day. This was not a dry documentary but an emotional fun and serious movie about a person, a time, events which happened, places we know and music we know but I at least erred on who was the writer and what was the true meaning behind the songs. A Canadian and Native American icon. I have recommended it to my children for their children and to schools saying this should be required reading!It covers not just the life of a person but of an erra that had shaped our lives today.",False
2,10,Great documentary...,LaxFan94,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs with any other program that deals with Native Indigenous content, I gave this one a perfect 10 because it looks at Ms. Sainte-Marie's triumphs as a musician while also looking at her tribulations in her personal life. That one moment where she mentioned that she was molested as a child really tug at my heart-strings! She mentioned that her early life was hard enough as it was with the Sixties Scoop and everything where many Native kids were stolen right from under their parents' noses and forced to attend the death camps known as the residential schools.But Ms. Sainte-Marie found her way to overcome her problems through her music. She is a true survivor and warrior woman! May the Creator continue to bless you Buffy and keep up the great work with your lyrics!",True
3,n/a,Soulful Portrait of a Dedicated Activist and Musician,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary has some genuinely moving moments. Buffy is a wonderful songwriter, with a somewhat unusual voice. Her longtime activism is real, and it's important. She does not come off as pretentious in the least, and she is not afraid to express pride in her achievements. Throughout the film, she reveals her successes, hopes, and failures. The film highlights some of her popular songs, and touches upon the key contacts she made in New York City, when she was starting out. I enjoyed several of the interviews with other musicians or industry people who have been impressed with Sainte-Marie's body of work over the years, including Joni Mitchell. As always, Mitchell comes across as wise and authentic in her remarks.",False

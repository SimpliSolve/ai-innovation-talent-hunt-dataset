1,8,Energetic and Personal Metal Documentary,alexa2022sd,n/a,15/08/2025,"Director Rita Baghdadi made an excellent documentary about the Middle East's first all-female heavy metal band, which is called Slave to Sirens. These two best friends pursue their art in Beirut as political turmoil unfolds. The film is personal in ways that exceed your usual music documentary. A small film that's worth a watch.",False
2,7,Metal!,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerShery Bechara and Lilas Mayassi are the lead guitarists and co-founders of the Middle East's first all-female thrash metal band, Slave to Sirens. The Lebanese society they were born into is perhaps not the most open-minded one, especially for women who want to play as hard as the guys. And Lebanon may not have much of a metal scene, but certainly no other female-led bands.Director, writer and cinematographer Rita Baghdadi has created a documentary that takes you into their lives, a place where they're still learning and exploring their lives, all while making what they do seem as vital and needed as if you were playing alongside them.According to Revolver, ""In the 1990s, Christian religious institutions turned against metal culture, linking it to the suicide of a teenage boy and calling for a ban on all metal music."" The Christian and Muslim communities that live side by side can easily damn metal musicians and fans as outright Satanists - no different than American, but perhaps more dangerous, despite Lebanon being more culturally inclusive than other countries surrounding it.Bechara and Mayassi met at an anti-government protest in 2015, so they certainly don't shy about confronting the world around them in their music. Along with drummer Tatyana Boughab, bassist Alma Doumani and singer Maya Khairallah, Sirens follows the band as they struggle to exist and create art.Behind all of this, Bechara and Mayassi once shared a secret romance before Mayassi met a Syrian woman and broke off the relationship. In the tradition of bands keeping going in the face of heartbreak and unresolved relationships, they remain friends and bandmates, even if things aren't the same. Over the three years the movie covers, we see everything from them playing a sparsely attended Glastonbury gig to recording a new album, working their day jobs and even the Port of Beirut explosion, which leads to Mayassi pondering afterward, ""Home doesn't feel safe. Friendship doesn't feel safe. Love doesn't feel safe.""As the band blasts riffs into the night, defying rolling blackouts and suburban bombs, perhaps the strife between the women who formed the band can be forgotten. If you've been in a band, you'll recognize the times when the bad times are all worth it, the quick seconds that occur when a harmony is perfect, when a riff is discovered or the crowd - no matter how small - is with you ever beat, every word.",True
3,6,Not music documentary or a documentary about a band... so what it's?,MidooAshraaf,n/a,15/08/2025,"Undoubtedly if you expect a music documentary you will be very disappointed, but this is not the filmmakers' trespass because they didn't pledge any music-genre film.So is this a movie about a band?At one point during the film it may seem like a documentary about a band, but also it's not, because you'll finish the film with nothing you knew about the band.The film only captures the story of two main characters from a female-metal-band in a society that still shows something of conservatism. Lebanon is far more culturally open country compared to its neighbors, so you won't understand wither this movie about the culture challenges that could face a female metal band? But this is not well introduced and captured in the film.Is it about the freedom of emotional practices in the country? But this is a case discussed timidly during the film.Is it about the relationship between two main characters in the band? MaybeI think that the film is about all of that but very cursory with a technique will not satisfy your ambitions. And the usual clich√© scenes of revolution and demonstrations in the Arab world without using them in a real way within the context of the story.Finally I found the film tickles my desire to know the stories, but does not satisfy it, just like a large number of teen indie films in the Arab world.And I quote from another review ""interesting but noting much""",False
4,10,A triumph!,bokireviews,n/a,15/08/2025,"Exceptional filmmaking and wonderfully human stories portrayed in settings so authentic that it feels like a stroke of destiny for cameras to be present in the moment. A heart-wrenching yearning for freedom of love and music, amidst political and social chaos and intolerance.There are moments where the camera captures silent expressions that say so much and reveal the inner struggles of the real-life characters living in a world that is not made for them. These five women somehow persist and seem impervious to the devastation around them, including the horrific explosion in Beirut in 2020. The director Rita Baghdadi never plays the female power card, their strength is simply present in every shot, regardless of what they are going through. But what stands out the most is the emotional tension between the two band leads, so authentic and palpable, unmatched by the best of fictionalized accounts of conflicted love and friendship.Easily the best documentary of 2022.",False
5,10,Unique look into the Middle East's first female metal band,klncl,n/a,15/08/2025,"Loved this doc about the first all female metal band from the Middle East! Baghdadi did a great job of exploring life in Lebanon not only as a metal musician but also as a woman - after all, it's all related. It's not easy to be an all female band anywhere, let alone in a region where metal is still more of a nascent genre. The doc also included the effects of the economic crisis and the Beirut explosion on the women's lives and journey as a band. The filmography was really beautifully done and I enjoyed the score as well. I found myself listening to the band nonstop after even though I'm normally not a metalhead. I can't wait to hear more from these women and follow their trajectory!",False
6,3,"Not a ""band movie"" as promised",fuqshytup,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was intrigued about an all female metal band in the Middle East. This movie has about 5 minutes about that subject. The rest of the band story is just normal intra-band drama that's not unique to Lebanon or women.The main through line of the movie is about the two guitar players being lesbians. The singer, drummer, and bass player are barely seen on screen. The guitar player's mother has more screen time.It was about young women fighting against cultural expectations like getting married and having kids, being straight, and not being into metal. The metal band angle is just one more way they are outside of the norm, but it is just the background for the story.If you're looking for a story about music, bands, and especially the struggles of a female metal band in Lebanon, you will be disappointed.If you want a story about 20-something Lebanese lesbians trying to find their way in society, and those women just happen to be in a band, then maybe you'll like it.Though, taking away my disappointment that the ""female metal band"" angle was just a publicity tool and not the subject of the movie, I still can't recommend it. It's just not compelling. The lives of some random women. Nothing more.",False
7,10,The most metal people on the planet,erickenehan-790-917123,n/a,15/08/2025,This film is a beautiful portrait which follows some of the most metal people I've ever seen in the chapter of their origin story. Rita Baghdadi is an documentary cinematographer of the highest quality with the instincts of a D. A. Pennebaker. The editing and original score all hold up to these praises as well.The women who are the subject of this documentary are utterly fascinating. Fearless for the sake of art and protest to the highest degree. But fearless not in a way that they become or try to be different than who they are to find their voice. Fearless in a way that they handle their personas with natural grace in a climate that would prefer they were different (and by that I mean conform.)There is criticism that the story doesn't offer more. But that is not real life. This is a character study of real life happening in a country on the brink while a group of young women build a metal band (a very good one.) It's a story of LGBTQ acceptance in the face of discrimination and hate. It's a story of protest in the face of dominant oppression. It's the story of women not doing what their supposed to do. I don't know what's more metal than this.,False
8,5,Interesting but there's nothing much,peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"Saw this back at the 2022 Sundance Film FestivalDirected by Rita Baghdadi and it's about Lilas and Shery, co-founders and guitarists of the Middle East's first all-female metal band, wrestle with friendship, sexuality and destruction in their pursuit of becoming thrash metal rock stars. It's not often we hear about an all female band in the Middle East country so this was pretty intriguing to say the least. However, it wasn't the exact documentary I was hoping for. Baghdadi has good presentation and some interesting conversations, but they get all mixed up with other topics that are honestly unrelated with the movie's purpose.Lebanon is an interesting country when it comes to it's political stance and culture of gender so it was pretty disappointing that this documentary didn't offer any major insights on the big issues it is wanting to present. The music elements are only presented half way in the film and everything else is about marriage, life, and culture which didn't have any relations with the band at all. The presentation is good and the music soundtrack is good as well. But honestly, there wasn't anything to offer instead just being okay.Rating: C+",False

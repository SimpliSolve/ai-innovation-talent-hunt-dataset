1,7,hope for the future,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"SXSW 2022
Greetings again from the darkness. For as far back as we can trace human existence, the older generation has grumped on the younger one. It's unlikely Neanderthal parents used the term 'slacker', but they undoubtedly got their point across to the youngsters who were inept at hunting and never seemed to gather much. Gillian Jacobs is best known for her acting (the TV series ""Community""), and in directing her first feature length documentary she serves up proof that the rising generation offers plenty of hope for the future.The film opens on a crowded gymnasium filled with noisy kids and action around some funky looking automated devices. It turns out what we are seeing, and what Ms. Jacobs set out to document, is the 2020 FIRST Robotics competition in Los Angeles. For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) is an international non-profit organization co-founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen. The mission is to encourage and develop students in the field of engineering and technology through what they term, ""coopertition"", a blend of cooperation and competition.We follow four distinctly different teams as they prepare for the competition. One team is from an upper-middle class California area and has 60+ team members. Another is from the Watts area and is much smaller. Interestingly, the adult mentors for these two teams are a married couple, displaying the true meaning of coopertition! The other two teams are from Japan and Mexico, respectively, and Ms. Jacobs wisely focuses on one student leader from each of the four team, making it easier for us to connect and follow.The pandemic wreaked havoc on the teams as the competition was canceled for two consecutive years. However, the kids proved just how resilient they are as they committed their time and skills to building facemasks, respirators, and contributing to society in every way possible. Of course this meant even more excitement was generated as the 2022 FIRST Robotics competitions kicked back in ... and we get to experience the emotions. The focus on teamwork and alliances is refreshing to see, and the joy on the faces of students makes it all worthwhile. This may seem to revolve around robots, but it's actually life lessons for everyone involved.",False
2,6,It's really not about winning?,housearrestedever,n/a,16/08/2025,"So what's the meaning of a competition? To people who really want to win in competition, winning is really about everything.Only the losers would comfort themselves by saying ""It's really not about winning..."" A very usual excuse when losing in a competition. ""More Than Robots"" is a documentary about incentives, innovations, team works, persistence, cooperation, coordination, mechanics, mathematics, supports, sponsors, funding, but most of all, the pure heart of the teenagers, their energy, passion and enthusiasm.If you've decided to participate in a competition, only the motto of ""Winning is everything"" as the goal would push you forward, not just the opportunity of participation.",False

4,8,"Reviews about ""winning I've everything""",blenderjunk,n/a,16/08/2025,"The few reviews on here talking about winning is everything misses the point entirely and has never participated in FiRST or else they'd get it.The organization is nurturing a generation to compete using teamwork, but not at all costs or scorching the earth on the way to victory.There are phrases termed by FIRST:
Gracious Professionalism - be respectful when winning or not, leave something better than you found it.Coopertition - help out other teams, maybe with a power tool or resources, so you can beat them at their best.They are trying to instill in all of us by building robots together we can be better humans in life And in the workforce.The students I've worked with have grown to be exceptional teammates and leaders, the future looks bright.",False
5,8,Surprised,easyeric-45201,n/a,16/08/2025,"Didn't expect to enjoy this documentary as much as I did. Stumbled onto it at Disney and put it on as background noise while playing a game, but it quickly pulled me in. Follows a couple teams from different countries as they prepare to compete in the FIRST robotics competition, which I've never heard of. Enjoyable and optimistic.",False

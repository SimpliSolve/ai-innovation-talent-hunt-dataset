1,6,A MUST-WATCH FOR ARABIC WORLD FANATICS,jeromesgabilo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was an amazing documentary on natural resources that Saudi Arabia has to offer. Not only was this compeehensive and in-depth, it also opened my eyes to the diverse terrain that the country is made up of. I have never watched a single documentary about the country and nearby states, and this was such a revelation, having been accustomed to seeing the Kingdom as mostly dessert and city. The narration was clear and concise, and the cinematography was top-tier. I could really see myself watching this for a long time if it was created as a limited series. The only problem I had was it was too short. I wished it could have had longer runtime.",False

3,4,Advertisement for Saudi Arabia,mjdygm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a sucker for nature documentaries and this one appeared on Netflix looking like a cousin of Planet Earth. But there's something fishy here.Upon watching it, this film comes off less as an opportunity to learn about animals and the environment and more like an advertisement for travel to Saudi Arabia along the lines of ""Come to Saudi Arabia-we have much more than oil and human rights abuses.""The high quality of the footage makes it clear that the film makers had a lot of money, and if you dig into it online you'll find that it was produced by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Media. I wonder how much they paid Netflix to air it.",False
4,4,A beautiful tourism advertisement,JakeBrinkman,n/a,16/08/2025,"The shots are beautiful, but don't expect them to all contain nature. This show presents a series of popular Saudi Arabian tourist spots and research buildings that are related to nature and animals. Some animals are shown exclusively in captivity with no wild footage at all.I greatly prefer the series Wild Arabia. That show did have lower quality cameras, but it (a) showcased all of the same animals plus more, (b) it had significantly more documentary information about each species, (c) it had actual scenes of their behavior in the wild rather than captivity, and (d) it explored the symbiotic lives shared between humans and some animal species.",False

1,6,It's a documentary,sameerlodaya,n/a,15/08/2025,"Now this the documentary of Jaipur kabadi team owned by Abhishek BachchanYou can see struggle of players, coaches and the ownersDefinitely for regional players this the big platform for their sport and recognition globallyIt is well executed and gives good knowledge for the upcoming players and specially for children who see their future in this sportA Little long but can be watched",False
2,8,A rare and honest sports documentary.,dhavalincredible-45853,n/a,15/08/2025,"Good sports documentaries are rare in India.
On top of being good this is a very honest documentary, which doesn't shy away from showing the tension between team members and coach, the very brazen coaching approach of the coach Srinivas Reddy, the vulnerability of a franchise owner, the humble background which most of the players come from, and how hard it is for them to adjust to the limelight that Kabbadi is getting lately.
The only complain I have is that this felt a bit rushed for someone making a documentary for first time in this sport they should have taken time to develop all characters in the team, other competing teams in the league and the emergence of sport itself. A miniseries with just about 2.5 hours of content didnt do the justice to the topic.
Its also great that they aired the series regardless of Jaipur pink panthers overall performance being so poor in that season and future of most of the protagonists hanging in balance, it just adds to the feeling that this is a real work of documentary and not some Bollywood fairy tale.
Overall a greta watch.",False

4,10,One of the best sports documentaries,boblamba-47587,n/a,15/08/2025,"Awesome and watched it in one sprint! Unlike documentaries it really makes you emotional. You start feeling for AB, coach and players once they start loosing matches. BBC did a great job in the way they interspersed their tournament journey with personal life story of the players! Great experience watching it.",False
5,6,Kabaddi Kabaddi Kabaddi !!,madhukar30,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think documentaries or docuseries or basically anything that follows a real person's journey has become restricted to a formula. You show their humble beginnings, their struggles, then their rise to fame, then the corruption of the mind due to the fame, and finally how they overcome that by harking back to their initial days of struggle. For the most part, Sons of the Soil does exactly that, and for a person who hasn't watched a lot of kabaddi, it was fairly engaging. It zoomed across the nation to show every player's background and it got me in the feels as well. The cross-cutting between the soft centers of these people and the hard exteriors that they've to put on to make a living was interesting. But then suddenly, it just turned into an out-and-out tragedy and started to rush towards the ending, failing to tell the complete story.That said, it does show that neither Abhishek Bachchan nor the team is afraid of showing themselves at their most vulnerable. See, we know a lot about Bachchan, his filmography, and how he has constantly faced criticism for being a product of nepotism. But does that make him a bad person? I don't think so. Here he's evidently using his privilege to shine a lot of light on people who probably would've never gotten the opportunity to shine. He is almost devoid of arrogance and given how the series focuses on the JPP's failures, he makes it clear that he isn't afraid to show that. I think that's quite a bold move considering the kind of flak he faces every time he says anything. However, if that was always the intention of the series i.e. to normalise failure and show it as a part of our lives, I think that the approach should've been a little more concrete and not so meandering.Overall, a very good watch for everyone, especially if one is into Kabaddi. The only grouse is that 5 episodes isn't enough to tell the entire story. I wish they make more of this to take forward the stories of small people from distant places, just to inspire everybody in the vicinity to shout about their dedicated efforts and hard work.",False

8,9,Want another season..!!,skunal-15980,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was the first series/documentary I watched on kabaddi.. It was definitely worth it.
Bbc team did a good job capturing both team & management's pov..
Management & Mr. Abhishek Bachchan did a good job giving them access to behind the scenes. :)
I really want a season 2 regardless of the win or loss.. Maybe they can increase the length of the series & add more teams etc. (like in formula1 Netflix documentary)
I literally signed in just to give this a thumbs up üëç
This series is definitely gonna increase Jaipur's Pink panther's fan following..",False
9,8,Quite different to many other sports documentaries,gaurishkohli,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have watched a lot of sports documentaries, most of them try to whitewash the struggles of the team. But this really presents the ups and downs which the Jaipur Pink Panthers faced in their 2019 season. It also gives an in-depth view of the culture of kabbadi in India, especially rural small town India. It is worth watching this docu sports series.",False
10,9,A Satisfying Watch,kanika-25576,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLoved the series. But I am particularly impressed by two things
A. To make series despite losing, is inspiring
B. Just shows what amazing character does Abhishek Bachchan has. Totally impressed",True
11,10,A delight to watch such an amazing series,janhavipardeshi,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was a great feeling to watch this series,excited to watch more of this stuff in future.I know how it feels to see such an amazing franchise and their story behind the limelight is almost unknown for others. I am a huge fan of Jaipur Pink Panthers who are always roaring and never give up in any match. It takes a lot of courage to be a sportsperson because people only see the victory of a person but no one recognizes his/her hardwork and support. A great job done by Abhishek Sir and he has faith in his team and this is the biggest thing for the team. Wishing JPP a successful journey ahead in Pro Kabaddi and I believe that they will win the upcoming season.
All The best team! üëçüëçüëç
hope to see you in your best form next season.",False

1,6,A Rare Miss for a Comedy Favorite,billydennisjr,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a longtime fan of Nate Bargatze, I went into his latest Netflix special, Your Friend, Nate Bargatze, with high hopes. Having thoroughly enjoyed his previous specials-The Tennessee Kid, Greatest Average American, and Hello, World - I was expecting another round of clever, laugh-out-loud comedy. Unfortunately, this special didn't quite deliver.To start, it felt like the material wasn't as sharp or well-developed as in his past work. Nate has a lot on his plate these days - he's touring, hosting a podcast, working on corporate gigs, performing on SNL, and tackling other projects. It seems like this packed schedule might have left him without enough time to fully refine this set. The result is a special that feels rushed, with jokes that don't land as solidly as they should. Surprisingly, he even reused some material from earlier specials, which felt out of place in what should have been a fresh performance.Another noticeable difference was Nate's demeanor. In his earlier specials, his dry delivery was balanced by an energy and looseness that made his performances feel warm and engaging. Here, the dryness was dialed up to a point where it came across as flat, almost as if he wasn't having fun on stage. He seemed less invested in the material, and that lack of enthusiasm translated to the audience, whose laughter seemed subdued compared to his earlier shows.Watching this special left me nostalgic for The Tennessee Kid, which remains my favorite. That special was packed with brilliant observations and moments that had me genuinely laughing out loud. By contrast, Your Friend, Nate Bargatze had me smiling here and there, but it lacked the consistency and punch of his best work.That said, everyone has an off night. With everything Nate is juggling, it's understandable that not every project can hit it out of the park. If this is your first time watching Nate Bargatze, I recommend starting with one of his earlier specials to get a true sense of his comedic talent.While this special might not be one I revisit, I have no doubt Nate has it in him to bounce back with stronger material next time. For now, though, this one felt like a swing and a miss. Generously, I'd rate it a 6/10.Here's hoping the next special brings back the Nate Bargatze we all know and love.",False
2,6,"I love Nate, but very few new jokes, old jokes galore, and tired delivery..",megdelie-38902,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've always love love LOVED (not in a creepy way - don't hate lol) Nate Bargatze's comedy and saw him live not long ago in Green Bay, WI. But this special just seemed...tired. Truly hope he's doing ok. I wouldn't be surprised if he's a little burnt out. Heck, anyone would be with how much fame he's gained recently! Touring, SNL...it's gotta be a lot to say the least.I was so excited to watch this special, but at the end, all I felt was worry for him.Repeated jokes in this special also seemed (to me) to lack enthusiasm. I'm sure it gets monotonous to tour and say the same jokes over and over, but you'd think for a Netflix special, he could have at least faked enthusiasm.I'm truly hoping all is well with him. It's not a terrible special, but I'd recommend his previous stand up and his SNL skits before this.",False
3,6,Missed the mark.,tisakson,n/a,15/08/2025,"A few repeated jokes and some new material. But he just seemed off in this special. Far too long of pauses. He needs to speed it up. And many lines were delivered lazily. He is much funnier, typically. Maybe he's getting worn out? He's really not that funny of a person actually, but his humor and jokes have been hilarious in the past. This special just doesn't deliver like I thought it would. I've seen him live and laughed hysterically throughout the whole show. Much more energy. This is a massive audience. They all seemed kinda bored too. I hope Nate keeps up the comedy and continues to deliver in the future.",False
4,n/a,Weak set,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nate Bargatze's new comedy special is kind of funny, but it doesn't quite measure up to his usual greatness. The jokes feel a bit half-baked, and they're pretty safe and predictable-not the clever stuff fans are used to. He's still got that deadpan style and charm, but the pacing is slow and the laughs barely get beyond a mild chuckle. There are some relatable moments, but they're few and far between. All in all, it's a letdown compared to his better past specials.Also, who told him to put a whole section on animal cruelty in his set? Who are the people who laugh at this and find it funny? All of us who were watching agreed that he lost us at that point.",False
5,7,A great stand-up to watch with family,jaredlemin,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sometimes stand-up comedy can be a scary thing to turn on with family with so many comedians using crude and uncomfortable humor lately, but this one is a winner. Nate's style of delivering dry and often self-deprecating jokes create contagious laughter that grows and grows as he elaborates on parts or our day to day life so that we can see the hilarity for ourselves, almost as if we are discovering the comedy right along with him. His delivery is great, the venue is great, the crowd is great, and the special is great. I would have rated this higher, but the jokes aren't really my personal style. However, this is one of my most highly rated specials that don't have jokes that would be uncomfortable to watch with family. It is funny even though I'm clearly not the target audience.",False
6,10,The complaints people have are infuriating - Nate is amazing,skeefe-52328,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you know how comedy shows work and what happens as comedians gain popularity then you will enjoy this special for the masterpiece that it is. Nate is super popular right now and is everywhere. Over the last 12 months, Nates guested on tons of podcasts, morning tv shows, late night tv shows and SNL twice. And he tells jokes while doing these appearances which are from his latest stage act. But critics complains his jokes are ""old or reused"". They aren't. He's just shared a few jokes recently on the multiple media platforms he's been on.Yes his delivery and timing seems slower than his previous specials, because this special was filmed in front of a crowd OF OVER 20,000 PEOPLE!! He has to let the laughter of more than 20k people quiet down before starting his next joke. That is going to translate differently when you watch this on your living room couch. Comedians who perform to small crowded clubs have to be loud to be heard over the voices of barkeepers and wait staff, people eating and drinking and the noises coming from the busy kitchen in the back. Luckily volume can easily be edited and manipulated when these performances are broadcasted on TV, otherwise it would appear these comedians are just screaming jokes from the stage. Nate pauses for a beat so that the laughter dies down enough that the beginning of his next joke can be heard by the audience. So of course these pauses are shorter in his previous specials because his performances were in front of theatre size crowds. His timing isn't off. He is just brilliantly adapting and adjusting his delivery to meet the needs of his much larger arena crowd, as a great comedian should.There are rational and explainable reasons for all the things Nate is being criticized for in this special. Not excuses, but rational reasons. And it is infuriating to see this comedic genius be criticized because people don't understand how stand up comedy works. It's a wonderful show, unbelievably funny and it showcases Nate's brilliant mind. It is hilarious! Watch it! It's Comedy Gold!I give it 12 stars.",False
7,6,The Act is Starting to Wear Thin,FilmBuffAsh,n/a,15/08/2025,"Is this the slowest, most unaware man to ever live or is this an act? Judging by all of his specials I've seen, it's his stage persona. But it's wearing thin. We get it, your wife knows & does everything for you & you mumble & stumble your way through life. This man is my age, 45. This whole aloof act might have been funny as a newly married man in his 20's or even 30's, but you can't expect me to believe he has made it to the ripe old age of 45 not knowing anything. I guess I might choose Nate Bargatze if I was unaware of what comedy was and didn't know of any other comedians. But, he's shot to the top of the charts, though, so what do I really know? I guess a lot of people find this schtick hilarious. But, Joe Rogan has a lot of fans too. So, go figure.",False
8,9,Good Ol' Nate,Kindly-19599,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't know what the bad reviews are about, I get that comedy is subjective but I thought he did great. I don't think some people get when he's being sarcastic. He says out loud all the things we think about on a daily basis in a marriage. The beginning was a little slow but still had so many funny moments. The second half was so good and had my family laughing so hard we were crying and that hasn't happened for any of us when watching a stand up comedian in a loooonnngggg time!!! To find a comedian who can deliver true funny bits that are clean without needing to include all the inappropriate details that so many others rely on is refreshing. I like those other comedians also but it really shows how talented he is that he can be this funny without it!",False
9,6,I like Nate,EricBombardier,n/a,15/08/2025,"But unfortunately this special feels like a practice set before the big gig and also feels like it shouldn't have been filmed in such a big venue with center stage.The jokes are what you'd expect from a great 10 or 20 year old special but not something that we haven't already heard a hundred times. There's no new angle, no surprise, nothing special.Jokes about marriage and childhood when you are successful are hard to pull because usually that's the material that got you to the dance and when you're there, it's exhausted material and it feels flat, forced and clinical. And it was.The delivery was also off. It felt like it was a business monologue more than anything. Stand here. Say this. Talk about that. Don't forget this. I found myself chuckling, waiting for the punchline and it never really came.",False
10,8,Dizzy from rotating stage and camera,badgerrah,n/a,15/08/2025,Most of this was the usual funny Nate B. Material. But I got dizzy from the rotating stage and fast moving camera. Please slow the camera down!!! Or just stay with close up camera.Some of this material I've heard before. Nate still has great timing. Good observations of average daily life.Does his best when discussing how fast the world is passing him by.But next special you have to stop using the fast moving camera and fast moving stage. I tried only looking at the tv when it was up close. Hopefully they realize that good comedians just need an audience; no extra bells and whistles. Thanks.,False
11,7,One of my favorite comedians!,BigHeadRick62,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've seen about everything he has done and his comedy is always very good. He was almost blown off the stage from the roar and applause when this one started and that is well earned. He told some great stories, some new, some not so new. But in this special, his timing was off and there were long, unusual pauses. I got the feeling that he either wasn't feeling well or maybe he had a couple of drinks to loosen up and 2 turned into 1 too many. Something was different. But it was still very enjoyable. He has started a new tour. The Big, Dumb Eyes tour and I can't wait to see the content from that.",False
12,9,Classic Bargatze,brandonlawler,n/a,15/08/2025,"Superb set. The first half was exactly what you expect from Nate. I paused a few times just to finish laughing out loud. I even checked the time left, because I didn't want it to end. A few jokes you find yourself wanting him to explore the joke a bit more, but I'm sure he's tightened it up exactly where it needs to be. The reps he's put in... you can tell.. it looks so effortless.A few jokes towards the end I'v heard him do before, but they still had me smiling. He's clearly established himself as one of our latest comedy heavyweights.I most appreciate, like Chapelle, you know he's just a regular guy living his life AND a master at one of the oldest gifts known to man.. making others laugh.. hard.",False
13,7,"""A pizza party is my nightmare.""",classicsoncall,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is the third Nate Bargatze standup special I've seen and I can say I genuinely like the guy. However, unlike 2019's ""Tennessee Kid"" and 2021's ""The Greatest Average American"", the comedian's timing here seemed to be hampered by a slow delivery and long pauses between jokes. His observations were still funny, with riffs on doing his own laundry, his wife's insistence on getting a second dog, county fairs and gross overuse of ketchup. If he hadn't mentioned it before, we find out early in his routine that he used to be a water meter reader, a career he could fall back on if everything should suddenly fall down the proverbial drain. That's not likely, as 'clean' comedians like Bargatze are a rare commodity today. Not a single four letter word or an obscenity to mar his performance, and not just because he was introduced by his young daughter for this show. I have a pretty good idea that's how he is in real life.",True
14,5,Lacking substance,doublejjjj,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having followed his every move since the standup sets of 2017, I've always appreciated shorter sets. This latest special feels like a step back, lacking the depth and originality that initially made him stand out. While his earlier performances often showcased brilliance, his material now seems stretched thin, struggling to hold interest beyond 20 to 30 minutes.This show, in particular, feels shallower than any of his prior work. Bits wrap up within two minutes, leaving little room for meaningful comedic arcs or the kind of commentary that sticks with you. The rare callbacks to earlier jokes are met with over-the-top reactions from the seemingly satisfied crowd.What stands out most is the recycling of old material, including bits from previous shows and what I believe might even be SNL sketches. While reusing material might slide in a smaller setting, it feels lazy and underwhelming for a Netflix special, where fresh, compelling storytelling is expected.The show's packaging, from the glossy poster to his transformation into a polished Hollywood persona, suggests a deliberate pivot toward commercial appeal. While understandable, this shift seems to come at the cost of authenticity, which was a key part of his charm.Overall, watching this was an awkward experience. It felt less like a showcase of a rising star and more like someone going through the motions, prioritizing appearances over substance. Perhaps this is a calculated direction, but for me, it dampens the excitement I once had for his work.",False
15,10,Very funny! His delivery is everything.,g_veldman,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love Nate and his comedy! So simple and funny. His delivery is the best. I am 50 years old and his jokes feel nostalgic, particularly when he delves into the quirks of growing up in the 1980s. His observations about getting older are hilariously relatable. His comedy is for all ages though. I don't get the criticism about using the same jokes. At all. A comedian, much like any artist, can have a signature style or genre. His ability to revisit topics with new angles and unexpected twists is what makes his comedy so enjoyable. This show left me grinning from ear to ear. I can't wait to visit his show in the Netherlands! We will cheer him on!",False
16,9,Clean as a whistle,mreddwilliams,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nate Bargatze's comedy, presented on Netflix in a 64-minute format, is so simplistic, so everyday mundane that it comes off as funny because it's so familiar. From walking in front of his aging parents to comparing himself (as a person from the 1900s) to younger people born in the 2000s, Nate manages to offer observations, ask questions, and add commentary that can cause a crowd of 12,000 to laugh and applaud - and not a single naughty word. Clean-cut comedy on the order of Kevin James but with a slower pace and minimal facial expressions.I can remember when comics like Lewis Black got started, they HAD to remain clean cut because TV required family-oriented comedy: if you couldn't talk without foul language, you didn't get on the air.Would that we could return to common sense, clean comedy! Would that we could EXPEXT that kind of respect from entertainers!Well, Nate is your comic if you're sick and tired of the filth that dribbles from the foul
Mouths of far too many so-called comics. Indeed, even Lewis Black can't get through a sentence anymore without using f-bombs like they're no big deal. I don't listen or watch comics hardly anymore for the tirade of filth.Comics should watch Nate and take to heart the English language is fully equipped to facilitate comedy without stinking it up with vulgar words. As we learn in God's Word, ""put away all filthy language from your mouth"" and work instead to encourage and uplift one another with loving kindness.",False
17,2,I absolutely hate leaving this review...,MovieBuff0202,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't say this lightly, but this was just not good. I'm a huge Nate Bargatze fan. I've seen all his specials a million times and I even took my mom to see him and a few other comics at the Netflix is a Joke event earlier this year. He was great then as well, so I have really been looking forward to new material from him. Especially after seeing his SNL episodes which were hysterical. But I don't know what I just watched with this newest special. It was not what I expected at all. Something was off. I don't quite know how to put my finger on it, but his delivery was a lot slower than normal. And he normally delivers like a stereotypical ""slow southerner"". But this was different. And the jokes just didn't punch. I would hear laughter when it didn't feel palpable. Like it was inserted instead of natural. But since the jokes werent sticking, it was all off. So again, it pains me to give this a bad review but I feel like something was off with him when this was recorded. Like I said, I just can't put my finger on it but it doesn't feel right.",False
18,1,Disappointed,ghjsb,n/a,15/08/2025,"The whole show is basically just ""I'm stupid, I'm old, I don't read, I don't know what's going on, my wife is so much better and smarter than I am "" and so on and so forth. The jokes felt very sterile and were missing cleverness and wit. This made it a very boring watch. These jokes might work under other circumstances but because his style of delivery is intentionally dry, the jokes miss their mark. I have enjoyed some of his past work but this special is very corporate and PG. It might be something to put on in the background but besides that i wouldn't recommend sitting down and watching. Overall a disappointing special.",False
19,4,"Recycled Material, Lazy",dan-1516,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have enjoyed every single previous special from Nate Bargatze, re-watching most of them, which is why the recycled material was so disappointing. The delivery also seemed off somehow (slightly slower pace? Shame?). It felt like 2/3 new, 1/3 old material. Old material used in previous specials stood out immediately and literally took the smile off my face and stopped the laughter. It also has deterred me from ever paying to see him live as I now have zero confidence it will be fresh, new material. I can't imagine paying my hard earned money to hear jokes I heard years ago and already know the punchlines to. Also the overall sound quality of the recording is terrible - you can hear the echo of the arena making it sound like a bootleg recording. Lazy.Tips for future success:
1. Release the special after the tour so the audiences get 100% fresh material.2. Never reuse a joke from tour to tour.3. Record the special at a theater - arenas have TERRIBLE acoustics.",False
20,2,Not Worth the Money,mattdale-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Huge standup fan. Saw Carlin, Maher, Seinfeld, Rock (at his prime), Chapelle, and many others live. I liked Nate in smaller venues, but do not think this ""set"" warrants a Netflix special. It lacks the refined that the pros cultivate over the course of the road (see Seinfeld ""Comedian"").. This was definitely a pay day for a below average performance from an average guy who found a way to provide for his family beyond being a ""water meter"" reader. Nothing revolutionary or even creative here. Bland, boring, and would be considered amateur at best by any connoisseurs. Good for him for a big payday, but weak sauce.",False
21,2,I just don't get the appeal,stsorrell,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love to watch standup comedians, and I've seen at least a couple specials from Nate. While his brand of humor is not my cup of tea, this is the first time I've actually fallen asleep while watching.My wife wanted to watch this new Netflix special...I was all set to start the new season of Squid Game (talk about a severe difference in tastes). About 10 minutes in, I was already looking at my phone, playing games, and eventually dozing off.I would say that Nate is more of a storyteller that usually has a fair supply of humor injected. His delivery has always annoyed me as it's so slowly paced, and in this special, it seems to be even more pronounced. The one hour run time was probably close to 40 minutes of dialog.I'll give credit when it's due, even for comics whose style isn't something that I appreciate. But this time, it was simply boring. I may have chuckled a couple of times, but no good belly laughs. My wife seemed to enjoy it though, so there's that.",False
22,5,"Greatest Hits, Vol 1?",ThurstonHunger,n/a,15/08/2025,"This felt a little like a greatest hits collection, or I have comedic deja vu or something.Look, I dig the everyman who leans into his simplicity, if we learned anything from Homer Simpson the depths of the husband as clueless comedic resource are sadly infinite. And Nate's delivery fits fine, but is it possible that he's more suited to 200 people and connect more than being surrounded by legions of adoring fans.That sort of cuts against any self-mocking to a degree. Look I don't want him to get up there and do a Muhammad Ali butterfly and bee dance, I even kind of became entranced by his slow as a sloth steps, but the energy here almost felt like it was pre-ordered. Was the crowd made up exclusively of people who never have been on TV and have being on TV atop their bucket list?Anyways, with no Dave Chappelle special this New Years, Nate stepped in and did his part. The waters were safe and the jokes as well (i.e. Family friendly, you bet).Don't a lot of comics add writers as they grow, or maybe they do so and the writers are uncredited. I did notice this was just Nate on the byline.Not hating on it, and even jokes I've heard before were well told. He wraps it up nicely....enjoy but if you laugh your behind off, I'm guess it was some detached before.To be clear, I think there is another level ahead for the man, and there will be a Vol 2 - if not there's going to be a pretty dang funny Water Meter Repairman in your future neighborhood.",False
23,1,Just plain boring,kw7157,n/a,15/08/2025,"I previously watched and enjoyed some Nate shows, but this one was just boring. The material seemed to be stale and was far too drawn out to have any real impact. Add the central circular stage, forcing him to walk, and shuffle, around in circles, was also very distracting. The focus should be on him and what he is saying, not watching him walk around!",False
24,5,"Cool dude, but barely funny",totymedli,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was my first time seeing Nate. He has a good personality. He is a serious dude, but in a chill kind of way. He tells his stories slowly, maybe a bit too much with all those pauses, but he has decent pacing. It is appreciated that he doesn't swear and go on a rampage of breaking taboos. Most of the jokes are from the point of view of a simple guy. He tells stories about his relationship with his wife or things that come up as he ages. Pretty generic stuff, and none of the jokes were groundbreaking or something that was never heard of. They weren't particularly bad, but I had only a slight chuckle, maybe twice. I don't understand how the audience was so wild; many of the jokes were predictable and around common themes. He also lacks a deeper philosophical aspect, those typical ""that's true"" moments where something about our life was explained in an uncommon way. Because of these, even tho I was rooting for him, it was a forgettable performance.",False

1,10,A masterpiece of laughter and tears,OJT,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was so unexpected. How can a documentary about a known history about the Norwegian national football team (soccer) when the went from totally bad to the 2nd best in the World in the 90'ies be engaging?Well, cross on my heart; I've never laughed so much blanded with sharing tears in my eyes due to the sentimentality and feeling of a lost and innocent world, like I did here.Nor only Norway, but the world of football chnanged when Egil ""Drillo"" Olsen was the unlikely candidate to dig a very bad Norwegian team out of the mud, when he was hired to take over as coach.Not only did he win the first math 6-1, he kept the team winning and winning to such an extent t was a sensation. But he knew what he did. It was all due to system. Mathematics and an understanding of the game no-one seem to have discovered before him.The movie is put together by only archive footage, bound together with one or another written explanation, with no narrator. Still this functions perfect. It's s roller coaster of emotions, and an d interesting story as well.Don't miss out on this gem!",False

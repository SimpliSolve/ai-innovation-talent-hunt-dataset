1,9,Fascinating!,riaz_khan111,n/a,16/08/2025,"A deep dive into the relationship of poverty and mega cities, Still Human is a highly informative documentary by David Albert Habif. With help from various experts, Habif goes into depth regarding a variety of issues, prying open the various complications and contrivances that ensure poverty remains haunting us without any meaningful solution to the problem itself.The narrative voice-over is on point and the striking visuals ensure the audience realise the gravity of the situation at hand. Comparing Mumbai to Los Angeles, Habif not only illustrates the different ways in which poverty manifests in first and third world countries but also shows how greed, corruption and blatant apathy results in dysfunction in two of the world's biggest economies.Putting front and centre the scale of human catastrophe, Habif apprises the severity of the problem at hand and how this unchecked human catastrophe breeds a multitude of problems that then threaten security and stability of the entire region. The two hour documentary is packed with both data and interviews, providing a much needed informed perspective on the entire issue. One shortcoming that may be noted is the film's narrative pace. The pace lags in parts and some brisk editing here and there could have made the entire production a little better in terms of its message conveyance.Thought provoking and poignant, Still Human tackles the demons of poverty flawlessly. Using both interviews from experts and vivid animations, the film moves to give the audience a sprawling birds eye view of how poverty shackles the human spirit and ultimately prevents us from living to our potential. The film is both impactful and informational and should be mandatory viewing for any individual looking to dive deep into a megacity's various problems.",False
2,10,"A furious, ambitious, incisive documentary about what 'homelessness' means in the modern world",petermcgoran,n/a,16/08/2025,"Director David Albert Habif facilitates a searing, eye-opening discussion on homelessness, with experts from the United States, India, and beyond expounding on a wide range of topicsThose of us who live in cities (which, according to the latest statistics, is well over half the human population) are front-row witnesses to the fact that homelessness is rapidly increasing.And yet, whether through ignorance, weak assumptions, increased individualism, or just the chaotic and often fast-paced nature of modern life, the 21st Century has felt like a general tapering off of the discussion of homelessness and how we can help solve the problems that cause it.David Albert Habif is here to reignite that conversation - and he's doing so by lighting a director's equivalent of a stick of dynamite.Still Human is a meticulous, methodical, analytical documentary which delves into the nature of homelessness with a clinical eye and not a hint of judgement, moralising, blame-placing, or quick fixes.Habif speaks about homelessness on a comparative level, receiving input from experts, economists, doctors, activists, and homelessness workers from across the globe, in order to tell a multi-faceted 2-hour story.The documentary focuses most specifically on the USA and India, and how people respond to homelessness in those countries on political, social, medical, and personal levels.Habif's scope is incredibly impressive. He moves seamlessly from diving into the economic models of countries like Finland and Switzerland - and explains, in great detail (along with excellent graphics) why exactly their systems can't easily be replicated in countries which are 100x their size.From there, he covers everything from the war on drugs, to the oligarchical systems which threaten human progress and reinforce poverty, to mental illness, to different cultural responses to homelessness.At the centre of it all is Habif's voice - his clear, clinical narrative focus. The documentary works so well because Habif never tires of finding answers to the slightly naive questions that most of us have asked about homelessness. ""Why wouldn't it work to just build enough houses for everyone to live in?"" ""Why are there so many homeless people in LA?"" ""Well,"" he seems to say, ""here's a broad range of experts called upon to give insightful answers to those exact questions.""The documentary isn't perfect, of course. The wide range of topics covered - as well as the quick pace at which their analysed - can often leave the viewer feeling slightly lost or overwhelmed. As an example, within the space of a few minutes, you're thrown from modern-day homelessness, to the bubonic plague, to 17th English monarchial revolutions, to the Industrial Revolution, then to a quick stop at colonialism and slavery, then back to modern homelessness. It's compelling, yes, and you're very much there for the ride, but it's also dizzying and you sometimes feel like you're not always getting the requisite detail.Still, if the worst criticism that can be levelled at this film is that it covers too much, then that's not a bad criticism at all.Habif also deserves extra applause with Still Human for the fact that he never even hints at veering into a partisan political discussion (which many creatives and documentary makers in the Western world are guilty of doing). This film is far too intelligent and complex to find itself pointing a finger at 'right' or 'left' and saying, 'There's who to blame.' The issues are multiple - and Habif is determined to cover as many as he can.An excellent film.",False
3,10,A captivating Documentary that brings the issue of poverty to a comprehendible level.,malukitess,n/a,16/08/2025,"Still Human is an insightful documentary, visually stunning with a gripping storyline.Through expertly crafted editing, the documentary contrasts the issues of poverty in two of the worlds largest cities- Los Angeles and Mumbai. Rich graphics and moving interviews give viewers a real sense of the very different ways in which poverty is experienced on opposite sides of the world. The documentary contains captivating footage of the cities, but becomes even more powerful when it uses personal stories to demonstrate how corruption, greed and even the lack of apathy can create an environment of dysfunction and inequality.The documentary by David Albert Habif does an excellent job of illustrating the many ways poverty manifests itself both in first and third world countries. By contrasting the two large cities, He highlights their mutual pain points, makin it clear that poverty, oppression and inequality are global issues.There is no one solution that can adequately address the homelessness situation in Los Angeles, or any other city or location. Individually, it needs to be addressed one by one. Homelessness caused by poverty is an issue addressed by the doc, and we are shown how people respond to it in those countries( USA & India).Habif poignantly captures the realities of the grinding poverty many Americans face on a daily basis and provides a necessary reminder of the injustices and inequalities still present in our society.Still Human is visually stunning and impactful, truly an affecting and powerful documentary, its a must watch for anyone interested in humanity.",False
4,10,An eye-opening documentary experience,michellecgb,n/a,16/08/2025,"When we think about the biggest, most popular cities in the world, the last thing that comes to mind is poverty. Opulence, beauty, bright lights, and delicious food are a few of the things we think about first.However, people like director David Albert Habif do see the poverty there is even in the most amazing places and they strive to understand why it's there. Still Human, Habif's gripping and thought-provoking documentary on the matter, does exactly that.This is a 2-hour eye-opening experience that takes us to Mumbai and Los Angeles as we listen to a variety of experts break down the complex issues that contribute to poverty and homelessness.Habif makes a comparison between third and first-world countries to understand how they navigate the issue of poverty and examine the differences in politics, cultural responses, economic systems, and more.This is how Habif shows us that poverty and homelessness are global; they happen everywhere and finding a one-size-fits-all solution seems impossible because there are many factors at play in each context.As citizens of the world who have a voice, not just through voting, but through every action we take as members of society, we have to be informed. That's why I think this is an important documentary to watch. It provides a lot of perspective and facilitates the understanding of very complex realities.With an effective, focused, and intelligent narrative, Still Human plunges you right into it and highlights the many issues that lead to extreme poverty. And this isn't the only important topic Habif explores in this documentary. He also discusses mental illness, greed, oligarchical systems, and much more.It's clear to me that Still Human is a passion project that seeks to shake the viewer awake and start an important conversation. Not just about the factors that cause poverty, but also about how devastating it is at a physical, mental, and even spiritual level.I'd say Still Human is a must-watch if you're interested in social issues and value well-researched documentaries that show you things as they are so you can contribute to making things different at whatever scale you're capable of.",False
5,10,It doesn't get much better than this,dmode-71062,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI can't review this amazing documentary without giving up a lot. I don't think that really matters since there are many chapters and it takes a lot of time for all the concepts to sink in.That being said, I'm sure there will be spoilers in this review.My take on this overall, what the film is really all about, the main theme involves power and control. Meaning what is the zone of power one has over themselves and what is the scope of power one has to impact society and another person.When it comes to poverty, particularly in the US large cities, the ideas that we have as individuals of our scope of power is perverted. We expect small groups of people to make huge impacts a large groups of people, of whom are the most marginalized. And we as individuals forfeit all that power to these small groups and avoid the responsibilities that we have for others that are less privileged than ourself. The narrator mentions the ""Diffusion of Responsibility"" in the concluding chapter. That's really the perfect way to explain it.The film begins big. Looking at poverty on a global scale. There is an economist Daron Acemoglu who contributes largely to this part of the film. The question they try to answer is what makes nations poor and what makes them prosperous. He introduces his ideas of extractive and inclusive institutions. Ultimately the answer is that central planing doesn't work. A small group of people trying to make decisions for many fails every time.That theme is echoed over and over again until with get down to the individual level each and every homeless person. In the chapter case by case (if you are watching it on the youtube platform) hits upon this concept very well.The overall solution to sum up the homeless crisis in Los Angeles and any city or anywhere for that matter is that there is no one solution. It needs to be dealt with 1 by 1, on an individual level. Someone or some group of people need to meet that 1 person where they are at. And getting to them as early as possible is the best approach. The three main sources mentioned in the film are foster care adoption, ending the drug war, and managing mental health.These topics are sensitive, loaded and frustrating to discuss. That being said, I would still call the film a must watch.",True
6,8,Socio-Economic Decadance Exposed!,officialgloriasimon,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Still Human"" is a thought-provoking documentary that sheds light on the pressing issue of poverty and homelessness, which has baffled the world for years. Despite numerous promises made by governments to eradicate these problems, the issues persist and have worsened to the point of being neglected. This documentary aims to remind us of our duty towards humanity and awaken our conscience to the fact that the homeless community are human beings who deserve to live with dignity. Hence the title, ""Still Human.""It starts by highlighting the root cause of the problem and other contributing factors. The film reveals that the homeless community is a victim of inefficient bureaucracies, failed systems, lack of proper infrastructure, poor education, and sentimental leaders who implement policies without careful thought about how they may affect the larger population.Furthermore, ""Still Human"" gives us an inside look at how policies like drug-use prohibition put non-violent drug users in jail; more often than not, these individuals are put back into society without adequate provision for them to be able to live meaningful lives afterwards. There's also the ageing out of foster care policies that push young adults who cannot fend for themselves into society. These individuals, 90% of the time, end up sleeping on the streets. Thereby adding to the ever-growing number of this category of people.Unfortunately, the government seems to be using a holistic approach to solving the issue, which has proved ineffective over the years. In the end, based on expert suggestions, we learn that resolving homelessness and poverty involves a more micro approach that addresses the underlying factors unique to each homeless individual's situation before going mainstream.Additionally, the producer uses case studies, factual evidence of real-life scenarios, and expert insights to support his argument. With Mumbai and Los Angeles as case studies, we can connect emotionally to the subject matter.The documentary also follows a structured approach. It starts with introducing us to the characters in the story. First, the experts and then the residents of Mumbai and Los Angeles. Afterwards, we are given a deeper insight into each city and the prevailing circumstances, which is the conflict of the story- Poverty and Homelessness. The conflict is resolved in the end by establishing that resolving the challenge of poverty and homelessness in these cities will require a micro approach. However, I am concerned about the feasibility of this approach.Finally, the alternating interviews with experts and the narrator in ""Still Human"" make it engaging. But what makes it impactful is its focus on the human stories behind the statistics. The film reminds us that those experiencing homelessness are individuals with their hopes, dreams, and struggles, not just numbers. It also challenges us to confront our biases and assumptions about homelessness and recognise the inherent worth of every human.Overall, ""Still Human"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally compelling documentary that sheds light on one of our time's most pressing social issues. As such, it's a must-watch for anyone who cares about social justice, human rights, and the power of empathy to create positive change.",False
7,9,A stunning documentary!,veronicasharma-45936,n/a,16/08/2025,"Still human is an epiphanic documentary that teleports you behind the curtains of two of the biggest cities of the world, Los Angels and Mumbai, sheltering the most celebrated movie industries, Hollywood and Bollywood.Brimming with some of the richest people, how uniformly is this glorious life experienced by the citizens of these two places?The documentry is an authentic portrayal of the cities enveloped in glamour. It depicts the brutalities of LA and highlights the destitution of Mumbai.The unbiased narrative studded with facts and comprehensive research only leaves people flabbergasted.",False
8,9,An Extraordinary and Fundamental Documentary,jessiebearx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Still Human opens our eyes to one of the world's most substantial and devastating social issues; homelessness. The documentary covers the causes, effects and possible solutions to this ruinous problem in a highly informative yet comprehensible manner. Sharp imagery and high-quality audio combine to create a hard-hitting and emotional film. Transparency is maintained throughout, with varying viewpoints and possibilities offered to the viewer.Still Human creates a comparison of the overwhelming number of homeless people in Los Angeles, USA to those in developing countries, such as India. Presenting shocking statistics and opinions from experts in the field, the documentary highlights the ways in which homeless people are judged and excluded from society. Whilst watching the documentary, it becomes increasingly apparent that the reasons for such poverty are right in front of our eyes, we just refuse to acknowledge them. Through our actions and the actions of our governments, the poor become poorer and the rich become richer. We doubt what our individual efforts to help can do, so we create a society where nobody does anything. Most consider ourselves compassionate beings, but we ignore the ones who need our empathy and assistance the most.There is little to criticise about the documentary. Interviews with those who have experienced homelessness could have been an interesting addition. However, I believe that first, we need a basis for understanding this portion of the population, in order to avoid judgements or exploitation. Still Human, unlike many other documentaries on the topic, aims to humanize homeless people rather than merely providing footage with no background knowledge.I have yet to see a more inspirational and mind-altering documentary than Still Human. It's a documentary that I believe everybody should watch. Still Human is so incredibly moving that it is sure to stay in the mind of viewers long after watching. Most importantly, it has the potential to encourage real changes in society.",False
9,9,Blind eye to the hardship of Human,jayola-26038,n/a,16/08/2025,"In this day and age, it is all too easy to turn a blind eye to the hardships faced by those who live on the fringes of society. But through the lens of this powerful work, we are granted a poignant and unflinching look into the lives of the marginalized in two of the world's most complex and populous cities.Delving deep into the struggles faced by these individuals, the author masterfully weaves together a tapestry of the human experience, exploring themes of poverty, oppression, and inequality that transcend borders and cultures. Through his careful examination of these issues, we are challenged to confront our own preconceptions and biases, and to confront the harsh realities that face so many in our world today.In short, Still Human is a triumph of social commentary, a powerful and evocative work that speaks to the very heart of what it means to be human. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",False
10,9,Still Human Starts Strong,sleight-lane,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA powerful, clear-eyed indictment of systemic disenfranchisement and poverty, this thoughtful documentary compares the depersonalisation of displaced and marginalised people in Mumbai and LA. It outlines the divergent methods used in these cities to try and resolve problems, examining each in even-handed, accessible fashion.At its core, Still Human expands on the appalling yet unsurprising notion that poverty, the failures of mental health provision and homelessness are built in to our societies by design. They're tools, expertly deployed, to control populations and help those in power maintain their hold.Brisk editing, bold images and elegant narration delicately thread the needle of presenting facts while helping viewers grasp the emotional truths behind immense problems. These gird inspiring personal stories and expert testimony from academics and community activists working on the ground. It also confirms many links between what seem ancient societal ills and more modern preoccupations like pollution, plastics and intersectional identities.Essential viewing for anyone who feels helpless before the scale of human suffering. Ultimately hopeful, it sets out the case for conscious, consistent local acts as well as political and corporate will.",True
11,10,A Must Watch - Profound take on a Momentous Subject,malvikakancha,n/a,16/08/2025,"A highly captivating movie that makes one question the world we live in. The documentary by David Albert Habif exhibits poverty in two of the world's biggest democratic nations. Unravelling the complication of poverty in a way that tug at the heartstrings. A raw take on corruption, greed and blatant ignorance has led to indigence.The movie takes a dive into the root cause of poverty, behind the curtain of some the flourishing economies. Coherent narration with captivating visuals, the documentary gives a resolute view of the skewed society. The pacing makes the film engaging, gives a glimpse of the stark difference between the many major cities. The story moves back and forth between the depiction of major cities across the world and expert's narration elegantly balanced without pressing urgency.Still Human doesn't just scratch the surface but questions the root of the evil that has riddled humans for centuries. The documentary tries to seek solution with the central design in mind, to extirpate poverty with a valiant notion. The film walks through the sensitive topic of exploitation and slavery, pondering over how we have always been shackled by deprivation.A compelling story, Still Human takes on the challenges of poverty in a way that is both intriguing and emotionally moving.",False
12,9,Insightful & informative documentary on mega city poverty in the 21st century.,kerenza2000,n/a,16/08/2025,"Highly informative and factual documentary drawing on what poverty looks like in two mega cities (LA & Mumbai)

13,9,A captivating Documentary about the reality of two of the most populated cities in the world.,sushreesswain,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDavid Habif brilliantly narrates and explains the insider realities of two of the most populated cities in the world, Mumbai and Los Angeles. These two cities have a reputation for being the most well-known cities in their respective countries due to the high flow of economy as various industries flourish in these two cities, mainly the film industry. People from around the world want to settle in Los Angeles and most of the Indian rural and lower-middle-class population dreams of having a job in Mumbai.The documentary shows the harsh and twisted reality of both Los Angeles and Mumbai, which has to be brought to light as both cities have similar yet different socio-economic problems. On one hand, Los Angeles has a huge problem of homelessness while in Mumbai, more than half of its lower-income population lives in the slum. These slums are highly unsanitized and many of these people suffer from chronic illnesses due to the same. The documentary brilliantly shows the living conditions of the slums in Mumbai and provides a wide variety of information about why such a large population in a megacity lives in the slums and is below the poverty line.Los Angeles is filled with homeless people on its streets, the majority of them being black people. The documentary digs deeper than just the homelessness issues and gives us a reality check that eradicating homelessness isn't like a mathematical formula, we cannot provide help to every homeless person just based on one solution. This gives an insight into the drug problem of the homeless as well as the younger population.The animation team did a really wonderful job in visualizing the deeper and tougher concepts such as the distribution of power among the elites, the adoption problem as well as mental illnesses that people face such as schizophrenia. The way the documentary ends showcases the difference in culture and harmony in both these cities. In India, people have a deeper connection with spirituality and family values which is missing in larger cities in the United States. This puts into perspective of how both cities face similar issues yet the approach of people matters in solving the problem.",True

1,8,Brave and silly,hazangel-89910,n/a,16/08/2025,Watching this short documentary was very sad but not surprising. I think this young lady once she became famous felt like she could do and say anything without consequences. It does not work like that. There is centuries long traditions and religion that people are indoctrinated into.Her internet fame was not worth trying to expose old perverted men. Seems like she really needed to learn how to be discreet and perhaps when she was out of the den of lions (ie: out of Pakistan) then she could have been more brave and bold.I feel bad for her parents. Again not surprised that her brother will just get a slap on the wrist. Ultimately his behaviour is not truly seen as a major crime although the courts would like to make it seem that way.,False

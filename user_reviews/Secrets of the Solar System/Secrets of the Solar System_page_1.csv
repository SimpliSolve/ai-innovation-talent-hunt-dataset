1,6,3 Stars out of 5 Stars,ajneeago96,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although it has lot of cool facts about our solar system, there's just a lot of problems with this docuseries. The first episode is basically a combination of scenes from the rest of the show (which is just absolutely moronic and really affects my rating), lots of dumb placement of background music (particularly in the Venus episode), and they even forgot to include episodes about planets (Neptune and Uranus) and lots of key moons. Not a very comprehensive look at our solar system at all, but I found myself intrigued throughout most of the show.",False
2,4,Not including episode about Uranus and Neptune is a total joke.,v-26640,n/a,16/08/2025,"These are ice giants, much bigger than Earth and have had unquestionable influence on our Solar System. Uranus has its unique small planetary system with more than 10 moons, and planet itself orbits on its side. Neptune has unique moon which orbits retrograde , unlike any other moon, and has active geysers despite being 25 times farther from Sun than Earth.Omission of these planets is a shame on series producers.",False
3,4,Totally disappointed. See why,farshidn-02670,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know what is the first episode for! It is the spoiler of all other episodes; that the main facts or summary of them all.Although it is 2020, the data are outdated and not informative at all.I wonder why it has not included Uranus and Neptune!And so boring by the way
I just realized how different the result can be if the producers are pro and knowledgeable.",False
4,2,2 stars only,Filmreader,n/a,16/08/2025,"2 stars only and this because has nice photos, videos and graphics.The details in the narration are weak. They don't explain almost nothing.They leave you with unanswered questions how they solved and overcame various problems had the space vessels.I don't recommend this series.",False

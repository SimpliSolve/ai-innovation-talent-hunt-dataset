1,10,Much Needed Conversation,kimjarvis-37643,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every woman, everywhere, has to watch this documentary!!!The dissolution of women's rights in the name of political correctness should have everyone alarmed. The women and men featured in this documentary have nothing against trans people. They are rightfully alarmed by the escalating number of young girls with mental health issues who are being misdiagnosed as dysphoric and having their bodies permanently and radically changed. Puberty is hell on young girls and their mental health needs to be treated accordingly and not subject to activist ideology!Some of the issues raised are the fear of women losing their rights to safe spaces (shelters, prisons, bathrooms...) to predatory men who will take advantage of the situation. Or, of women in developing countries who are subjected to frequent sexual based attacks just because they are a woman and are thought to be of less value. Or, of women losing their rights to fair play in sport to transwomen who have an unfair advantage due to their biology (men have anywhere from a 20-50% advantage over women depending on the sport. It's much higher for bodybuilding sports).In ending, I'll amend my first sentence. All women, and men!, need to watch this.",False
2,10,Everyone needs to watch this!,tiki-1005,n/a,16/08/2025,Incredibly important film for the times. This stuff must be exposed before we do irreversible damage to generations of women and children. We need sense and logic to prevail.ðŸ––Keep up the fight WOMEN!!!,False
3,10,Compelling and Informative,senryu93,n/a,16/08/2025,"While we are awash with slogans these days, there's very little actual public research or understanding on this hot (in fact, radioactive) topic. Sundar uses interviews, animation and her own personal journey to illuminate the source of dysphoria, including in the third world, and the medical establishment's responses to this widespread trend. Insightful and informative regardless of your views. Any honest broker wanting to know more on this subject would do well to watch all four parts.",False
4,10,A compassionate and comprehensive exploration of gender ideology,Egginnit,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is a comprehensive exploration of the modern phenomenon termed 'gender dysphoria'. The rise of gender ideology in the western world, it's exportation wholesale to the global south, and it's subsequent impact on women and girls the world over is carefully charted over four instalments.Vaishnavi Sundar lends her own voice to the project, and introduces what is a contentious subject matter to the audience with true compassion- by way of her own experiences, navigating her way through childhood abuse, India's conservative attitudes toward women's social roles, and her subsequent unease inhabiting her female sexed body. She does this through deft use of animation, combined with a sensitive original score.Sundar has methodically edited hours of interview footage from a number of leading voices including clinicians, psychiatrists, sociologists, academics, feminists, and detransitioners. The result is an in-depth examination of the trans phenomenon itself and the physical impact this has on women and girls. In addition we get an in an insight as to why there has been such a meteoric rise in young females attempting to flee womanhood altogether- like a house on fire.",False
5,10,An absolute must-see,nephilimdto,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a heartfelt, heartbreaking and much needed foray into the world of gender identity and its repercussions.The bad faith 'reviews' by people who haven't even bothered to watch this beautifully produced and realised piece of work, show exactly why it's so desperately needed.Serious debate is needed, and if you don't watch anything else on this subject, at least watch this. You'll be very glad you did.",False
6,10,Excellent documentary (on an orwellian topic),niko7882,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're looking for honest material on the matter of gender identity, transgenderism and so on, this is a must-see documentary.",False
7,10,Timely and Important,this-10540,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary series covers some of the most important issues facing women and girls right now. It looks at the physical and mental effects of transgender ideology on young people with sobering warmth, empathy, understanding, and realism. It shows what has been lost in current discourse: a critique of the social conditions and the power arrangements of society--patriarchy--that makes so many young people feel trapped in the first place. It also points to how the transgender movement has garnered a whole industry of powerful drugs and chemicals that have profound, ever-lasting, irreversible impacts, and that this is one of the most problematic medical experiments ever conducted--hearkening back to the early days of psychotherapy, chemical castration, genital mutilation, etc. Yes, we're all the way back there. But perhaps most importantly, the series reminds us how gender is something to be abolished, not embraced, and so it's no wonder that young people have a hard time traversing this crazy patriarchal and oppressive culture we live in. But what's worse, is that even discussing this issue garners censorship, rape and death threats, de-platforming, silencing. Trans rights are human rights, but not in the way they say they are. I'm very thankful to Vaishnavi Sundar and everyone else who made this series happen. Your empathy, integrity, courage, and honesty is so very important and valued!",True
8,10,TIME TO WAKE UP.,xiaoxiaomao,n/a,16/08/2025,"Trans ""activism"" is a deeply misogynist, homophobic male supremacy movement in a dress. This documentary covers what this hideous ideology is doing to young women all over the world, making them feel so objectified and so hated that they try to escape womanhood in any way possible. There will be a reckoning in the future and tons of lawsuits for destroying an entire generation of young women.",False
9,10,Very important documentary,monica-53352,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very well done documentary about a difficult subject, treated with intelligence and love for the truth. A must watch.",False
10,10,MUST SEE FOR PARENTS OF YOUNG GIRLS,eileenellen,n/a,16/08/2025,"This whistle blowing film will blow your mind as to the depth of institutional capture surrounding the transing of children. In what kind of world would doctors, parents, therapists, detranisioners themselves be forced to risk everything in order to speak out and urge caution regarding the pushing of life altering medical procedures onto underage kids.How can this be happening with no fair reporting, no discussion, no debate, no follow up on the detransitioned - mostly girls some of whom speak here, caught up in social contagion, trying to escape a p0rnsick culture. Something very strange is going on, and this film will catch you up, enlighten and shock you all with a global perspective.Everyone must see this is a beautiful work of art.",False
11,10,"Incredibly well crafted documentary on effects of ""gender"" activism on women's rights",tallard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Vaishani Sundar has created a amazing work of research and insight and caring for the kids, the girls, the women, who are harmed by ""gender"" activism. Women have been fighting this since the first time in 1974 when a man was allowed to compete against female tennis players because he ""identified"" as a woman. This documentary was a long time coming, after decades of female and feminist whistleblowers being silenced.Girls can be ""masculine"", and boys can be ""feminine"" (whatever those words even mean!), we can dress as we please, career as we please, hairdo as we please, sleep with who we please. No one should be coerced into being intimate partners with the sex they are not attracted too.Finally, thanks to Vaishnava, women have a voice in the film industry.",False

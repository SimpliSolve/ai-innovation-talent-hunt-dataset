4,1,lower that a 1,trimblair,n/a,15/08/2025,"The worst waste of time on screen today. If you are a professional victim like these idiots, I feel sorry for you and your parents have failed on every level.

5,10,Wonderfully made,amberstetz-89420,n/a,15/08/2025,"Extremely well done, more Americans need to wake up and pay attention to the history that has lead up to this point in time. Go into the movie with an open mind and you will find yourself learning a lot about this country, our history, and what needs to be done to ensure a better future. A lot of people are too quick to judge based on their own political ideologies, put that aside and just pay attention to what the film is really about. We need to come together to fix these issues and it's never going to happen if too many people only absorb information that aligns with their already determined political ideology.",False

1,8,A story you've never heard of,garysung,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this a couple weeks ago and wanted to leave some thoughts here... The most striking part of the film is the collection and analysis of first-hand information from within China. Included are voice recordings, letters, interviews, archived websites, and much more. At first, I thought it was a documentary but this is much more than that. We hear the stories of two families; the events of what happened and chronology helps drive this film's ""expos√©"" of forced organ harvesting.This is not the box office stimulation of action and CGI. Rather, it is an exploration of what makes film-making great - to tell a story with inner meaning. Something that may change a person.",False
2,7,My feedback regarding of Harvesting Life Organ,sylviatanps,n/a,16/08/2025,"After viewing the show i was sad, the CCP unprecedented harvesting life organ of FA LUN GONG practitioner. Life harvesting of organ is a very inhuman action live movie . Since 1992 harvesting of organs is still ongoing , hopefully CCP is able to extinct this. Every human being has the right to survive and practice their cultivation and believe. FA LUN GONG practitioner being illegaly detain in their CCP camp and torture them in a very inhuman way. If they do not obey the rules or stop FA LUN GONG they will torture in a inhuman way. In summary, i felt that this inhuman should stop immediately as every human being have their own choices of practice and believe.",False
3,8,See what's really going on,girohead,n/a,16/08/2025,"Many have probably gotten random emails and considered them fake or conspiracy theory. This revealing documentary shows first and second hand experiences with this massive organization for this harvesting. It's inhumane, barbaric and upsetting. More need to see these realities out there and do something about it.The CCP seems to make Nazi Germany look minor league...unfortunately Americans seem to accept the propaganda before reality. Any mention of this abhorrent behavior or similar atrocities (animals, chemicals, ethics) are often dismissed as 'lid' or 'conspiracy.'Stop playing into and supporting this nonsense, we'll all be better off.",False
4,10,Very good documentary film,jasonwang-59778,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film expose the evilness of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on organ harvesting of innocent people. In USA, a patient has to wait for 2-3 years to get a matched organ. But in China, he can get a matched organ in one week.The reason is because the CCP has imprisoned large amount of innocent people, has tested their blood type, properties, etc and has built up a database. If any patient needs to do organ transplantation and is willing to pay enough money, the CCP's hospitals and doctors can search the database and quickly find the imprisoned person who has the matched organ.This movie presents undeniable evidence of the crimes by the China communist regime. International community should address the serious human rights violations.",False
5,10,A documentary that everyone must watch,fangfang-61804,n/a,16/08/2025,"Today I watched the documentary ""State Organs"", which was shocking. Through a large number of interviews with the parties involved, data analysis and expert testimony, the film systematically shows the shocking and cruel persecution of Falun Gong by the Chinese Communist Party. I couldn't stop crying while watching it.From the perspective of filming techniques, the director adopted a calm and restrained narrative method, letting the facts speak for themselves. Every piece of evidence in the film has been strictly verified. The interviewees include medical staff, experts and scholars, and the parties involved. The testimonies of multiple parties corroborate each other, which enhances the credibility of the documentary.The most impressive thing is that in the film, when the Minister of Health of the Communist Party of China Huang Jiefu faced the questioning of reporters, his silent reaction was better than a thousand words, which not only showed the truth, but also left room for the audience to think.As a documentary that reveals the truth, it not only records history, but also reminds us to cherish life and maintain human dignity. The significance of the film is to arouse people's conscience and jointly stop this kind of persecution.I hope more people can watch this documentary, understand the truth, jointly safeguard human rights and social justice, and end this evil persecution as soon as possible!",False
6,10,"Clear, not Scary, Everyone Should watch it",tsun-16205,n/a,16/08/2025,The documentary 'State Organs' shows in a clear but not scary way how the Chinese Communist Party government is taking organs from people without their permission. It's a big problem that more people need to know about. The documentary shows a serious problem happening in China now. It is important for people to know about this problem. You should definitely watch this movie if you care about human rights.This movie is about two young men who were taken by the Chinese police. Their families searched for them for 20 years and found out about a big problem with human rights. The movie is well-made and tells an important story. It's well-researched and interesting.It's a powerful story that will stick with you.,False
7,9,Really shocking,sufanle,n/a,16/08/2025,"People no longer disappear for unknown reasons, and their families cannot be found. It is really scary to know about the problem of organ transplantation through various channels. After all, in a China without democracy and the rule of law, anything can happen. , students have committed suicide, doctors have committed suicide, it is no longer surprising that people will disappear in China. Where do a large number of people go to China for organ transplants? Where do they come from? It is chilling. It is not easy to film this documentary. I sincerely recommend it. You must experience it for yourself. May we all speak out to stop this.",False
8,10,A brave art piece uncovering the inhuman live organ harvesting behind the CCP's deceit,lilianliu-28124,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a brave, sensational, and poignant film. I can't imagine how much risk and effort the production team has taken. Meanwhile, I feel blessed to be able to watch it. Thank you for revealing the false glory of the CCP and for exposing the cruel reality.Through delicately designed historical episodes and multimedia, the film vividly invites the audience back to early 2000s China, following the journeys of two families searching for their vanished relatives, who are practitioners of Falun Dafa. The dubious responses these two families received from the government, interwoven with evidence from lawyers, scholars, soldiers, doctors, and research reports, illustrate not only the dark, state-plotted live organ harvesting practices against countless Falun Gong practitioners but also how the regime utilizes media and governmental power to brainwash and control people while neglecting human rights.We hope for justice, or at least an ending that evokes kindness and fairness. But under an extreme regime, this is a luxury. In a world dominated by fabricated media, I cherish those filmmakers who strive to reveal the truth, helping us visualize the evil and dangerous situation we are in. This awareness allows us to wake up and speak out for human rights to save our peers, as saving them is akin to saving ourselves. Otherwise, today they are ""state organs,"" and tomorrow we may be ""state people.""",False
9,10,Great Documentary! Everyone Should See,tianlun-54310,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film reveals the horror society under the Communist China. I also saw TV reports from BBC and PBS in the previous years. It is shocking to find such evil things happening in this human world. Now even the doctor doing the opration stood out to condemn the killing. And the doctor is the real doctor who was at the operation at that time. So the documentary is a true story.Under the Chinese Communist Party's ruling, they force everyone to do evil things, killing for organs just like killing an animal. Any Chinese is now facing being killed. In recent years colledge students in Wuhan City many are missing. China has an over supply of organs such that organ transplant tourism has been rampant. About twenty countries have transveled to China to do organ transplants. A child of 6 years old was missing, then found dead while his eyes had been extracted. A Canadian patient, doctors claimed him a walking dead person, went to China doing the liver transplant, within a week, he is a life person, just paying the money and a new liver installed on him.In the USA and in western countries, one has to be first dead, then the organs can be donated, but in China, you are made to be dead for your organs donated. In the USA, a liver transplant patient needs to wait for 2 - 3 years to obtain the organ, but in China, if you have enough power or if you pay enough money, they can provide the liver within 4 hours, that is immergency operation!",False
10,9,This film is truly exceptional,my-42185,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is truly exceptional; it embodies both bravery and significance. The considerable risks and unwavering commitment demonstrated by the production team are commendable. I am grateful for the opportunity to view it. I extend my appreciation to those who have diligently worked to expose the facade of the Chinese Communist Party and to reveal the harsh realities of its regime.We aspire for justice, or at the very least, an outcome that reflects compassion and equity. However, in the context of an oppressive regime, this is often a luxury. In a landscape where misinformation prevails, I deeply value filmmakers who endeavor to uncover the truth, illuminating the grave and perilous situation we currently face. This heightened awareness empowers us to awaken and advocate for human rights, as protecting others is tantamount to safeguarding ourselves. If we remain silent, today they may serve as ""state organs,"" and tomorrow, we risk becoming ""state people.""",False
11,10,This video is worth watching for everyone,tangying-18191,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is so shocking. The CCP's harvesting of organs from Falun Gong practitioners and some prisoners of conscience has been exposed by the media many years ago, but it is still happening in China. The CCP is killing these people of faith. We must do our best. Help these Falun Gong practitioners in China, rescue them, and stop this inhumane persecution.This film is worth watching by everyone. The massacre of these religious people should not exist on this earth. The crimes committed by the Chinese Communist Party are just like the German Nazis treated the Jews. Everyone with conscience should not ignore what happened in China. Everything.",True
12,9,Unsurpassed Brutality,amykpc,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thank my friend Jane for recommending me this documentary, I have never expected brutality to such extent where innocent healthy people is killed while their heart is still beating. Is this the 2nd Holocaust after the collapse of Nazis ? What aren't the United Nations do something to stop this atrocities ? Is it because China is involved and he is a permanent committee member ? This is a litmus test to the human civilization and if all civilized nation is silent the world is in the course of self destruction, we hope this film be viewed by more people and spread the words. I believe most Chinese peoples are innocent and in fact they are the victims of this cruel regime, the Communist China must be eliminated just like the Nazis.",False
13,10,The evil deeds of the Chinese communistparty,ljx-78540,n/a,16/08/2025,"The day before yesterday, our whole family watched the documentary ""State-owned Organs"". It was so shocking!!! It was so infuriating! I couldn't even imagine that such a thing could happen in the world... The Chinese Communist Party, which is worse than the devil, treats people as livestock and slaughters them at will. How can this be done by humans? We watched it with tears in our eyes. It was so unbelievable. God will never forgive them. How can there be such bloody and violent incidents in the world? They harvested organs from living people and sold them at high prices. Oh my God! It's so terrible to live in the Chinese Communist Party's society! Where are the laws? Where are human rights? Where is freedom of speech? It is conceivable that there will be no such thing. Everything that looks good on the surface must be fabricated and whitewashed by itself. Those poor kind people whose organs were harvested alive, rest assured. God will definitely punish these evil people. The Chinese Communist Party is really a shameless devil. I have heard of some of its things before, but I didn't expect it to be so vicious. No wonder so many righteous people around the world are withdrawing from its organization! It turns out that people already know what it is! Falun Gong said all the truth. So many kind people have had their organs harvested alive. They have been persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party and have been forced to wander around. They cannot return home or reunite with their families. It is so sad! As I write this, my heart is trembling and crying... This bloody and vicious incident, please stop it!!! I want to tell the kind people to stop the evil deeds of the Chinese Communist Party. Don't let it continue to do evil, and don't hurt those innocent people anymore. They are all kind people... Today I watched this documentary again with tears in my eyes. I feel so sad. In the face of this ironclad fact, what can you say to the Chinese Communist Party? Those who are still in the dark, wake up quickly, and stop following it to do those things that are against heaven and earth, otherwise God will punish you together!",False
14,10,One of the biggest atrocities you've never heard of,ilikeikeick,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary does an excellent job of relating a story about a modern genocide happening that not enough people know about. It humanizes the victims and helps us see the impact of the Chinese Communist Party's persecution of people who have faith. Anyone who wants to know more about the fate of Christians, Uyghurs, Buddhists, and other persecuted groups in China will find this film illuminating. This isn't about ""China is bad""--it's about how a small group of people in power turn a nation's resources against those they want to undermine. It's one of the most important stories in contemporary world affairs.",False
15,10,Heartbreaking yet necessary,teojyun,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is important not only to learn about the evidence of forced organ harvesting, but also to understand how this atrocity has impacted individuals involved - from the victims and their families to the police and doctors who may be unwillingly complicit. Every life counts. The faster this is known to the world, the more lives can be saved. I love that the documentary not only reveals the heartbreaking truth but also offers hope for humanity. I can see the nobility of the human spirit and how it inspires those who are suffering, reminding us of the profound resilience and strength within us all.",False
16,10,Important Crisis that affects all people,BEV11,n/a,16/08/2025,I have heard about forced organ harvesting before but watching these stories of how this happens and the way the CCP runs this operation is something everyone should watch. The strength of these families and their commitment to finding their loved ones and exposing this truth to the world is amazing. I agree with the director that if everyone did a little bit to expose this and make a bigger voice against it to their own governments then the CCP would not be able to run this heinous agenda in China on its own people.Great story telling and keeps you interested till the end. Highly recommend!,False
17,10,Please share with family and friends,renagao,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter watching the movie ""State Organs"", my biggest feeling was that I felt heartbroken and sad. While watching the film, I couldn't stop crying. The heart-wrenching scenes left a lump in my throat and made me very sad. I am moved by those who still insist on their beliefs in the face of life, and I admire them very much. I hope more people can watch this video so that people can stop the greatest evil that the world has ever seen - organ harvesting by fire. I hope everyone can stop this cruel ""killing"" together and be a kind and moral person. I call on everyone to support this group of kind-hearted people, and hope that people all over the world can share it with friends and family to let them understand the greatest evil that has ever happened in China.",True
18,10,A must watch to know the dark side of China,alexkpc-27163,n/a,16/08/2025,I believed this has been happening behind the scene in China killing innocent people for their organs as I have a friend in Shanghai who has cirrhosis and he only waited like 2 weeks to get a new liver from an unknown source(after his wife paid something like CNY 600k) But he only survived another 4 months after he got complications from the unethical transplant (if this is from innocent donor) So bravo to the producer of this documentary acting to forewarn kind and innocent people to be more careful in China and don't get an organ transplant from China as someone innocent probably have to die for you.,False
19,10,A Must-see Documentary,jjang-92129,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA truly outstanding documentary, remarkable both in the depth of its subject matter and the quality of its production.The director employs an innovative structural design, skillfully intertwining the narratives of victims' families, witnesses, survivors, and investigators to vividly and powerfully expose the harrowing truth about the Chinese Communist Party's shocking crimes.While watching, I was moved to tears several times. I realized the unimaginable scale of the CCP's atrocities, and that these horrors are still ongoing in China today.The film's conclusion gave me a sense of hope. Yes, if more people could see this documentary, it would expose and dismantle the CCP's evil crimes more effectively. I believe this is a documentary that no one in today's world should miss.",True
20,10,A Harrowing Wake-Up Call,gychls,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""State Organs (2024)"" is a documentary that left me both shocked and deeply moved. It exposes the atrocities of live organ harvesting in China, specifically targeting Falun Gong practitioners, a state-sanctioned crime carried out by the CCP.Even though I was somewhat aware of human rights issues, I wasn't prepared for the severity and scale of what's presented in this film. The idea that countless people have vanished without a trace, simply because of their faith, is both heartbreaking and infuriating. Families are left in limbo, not knowing what happened to their loved ones.What really struck me was how solid and convincing the evidence is. The filmmakers present firsthand accounts, expert interviews, and thorough investigative research that piece together a disturbing picture. It's alarming to think that such violations could be happening today, yet so many people remain unaware.This documentary isn't just informative-it's a call to action. It forces us to confront uncomfortable truths and compels us to speak out against these injustices. This needs to stop.I highly recommend watching ""State Organs"". Awareness is the first step toward change, and this film does an incredible job of shedding light on a dark reality that demands global attention.",True
21,10,Terrible Chinese Communist Party,hongjieg,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film profoundly reflects a social reality that objectively exists in present-day mainland China, which is that many people mysteriously go missing.The Falun Gong faith group has been suppressed by the CCP since 1999, and 25 years have passed. While the exact number of Falun Gong practitioners who have been forcibly disappeared may not be known at this time, I believe that everything is being recorded by Heaven, and that in the end, good and evil will be repaid.Falun Gong practitioners believe in Truth, Compassion, and Forbearance, while the CCP advocates falsehood, evil, and struggle. As a result, the CCP has resorted to every possible means to eradicate Falun Gong, fabricating countless slanderous lies. They have even resorted to the horrific practice of harvesting organs from Falun Gong practitioners for profit, completely disregarding human conscience. Those who participate in the persecution have been transformed into inhuman beasts. Such actions are truly incomprehensible.I hope this film will be seen by more people and awaken everyone's conscience. Let us work together, extend a helping hand, and put an end to this state-sponsored atrocity against humanity. We must stop the senseless slaughter of innocents and refuse to be accomplices of the devil.I pay my respects to all the creators of this film. It is through your efforts that more people are able to witness this atrocity. Thank you for what you are doing; you are undertaking something truly great.",False

the truth of organ harvesting happening in China. All people around the world should see this film.It is so sad that the truth has been there for more than decades but no one wants to believe it.Although the film shows the cases of Falun Gong practitioners as the main victims and now there are more evidence showing more and more Chinese people become the victims.If we don't do it now, then we may be the next victim. This will not only speak for the organ harvesting victims they could not speak for themselves but for us the future victims.After we all know about the truth we need to stand up and say NO, Stop! Please spread the words to our community, more people know and more people will join us to say louder No, Stop.",False
24,10,I was shocked by the evil CCP,ycy-00104,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's so shocking. This is the CCP. There is nothing it can't do, except what you can't imagine. The live organ harvesting is not only targeting Falun Gong practitioners, but has now extended to every citizen in China. Therefore, we must recognize the true face of the CCP and speak out for the safety of every citizen in mainland China: disintegrate the CCP, and we will have a bright future. This documentary truly reflects the evil that is happening in China. We really need to think calmly and not be deceived by the CCP's lies. Wake up quickly.

Actually, each victim is one story and no matter how agonizing, those stories are stories about winners not loosers. State organs is well made film, with great editing and really great scores which help avoid melodramatic moments, instead of emphasizing them. I reccomend the film both to those familiar to the subject as well as those who don't know that probabbly the worse crime in modern history is happening now - in China.",False

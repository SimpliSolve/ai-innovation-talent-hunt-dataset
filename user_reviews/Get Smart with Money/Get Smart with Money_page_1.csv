1,5,Pretty simple point,ateiram-91352,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show is ok. However it always drives me nuts when I see these HUGE cars for just 1 or 2 people and the DAILY takeout orders and then the same people complaining about money. It's just not serious. Also, 300$ for a phone, monthly.Yes, we people live in different realities. And yes, it's completely possible and achievable to live within your means and save. This feeling of freedom can not be compared with anything.And no, a family of 3 doesn't NEED more than 2 bedrooms. A family of 4 doesn't NEED more than 3 bedrooms. Anything more is done for boasting how successful you are. Not for upgrading the quality of your life. You just have more rooms to take care of. More cars to maintain. More clothes to store. You get the point.",False
2,6,Underwhelming Advice,lukeseegmiller,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you are hoping for financial and economic experts providing fundamental personal finance advice, you'll be disappointed. Instead we get underwhelming advice following unique case studies of individuals in different financial situations. I do appreciate Netflix's attempt in trying to capture the widest audience possible, but if you already have a basic understanding of budgeting and investing, you're more advanced than the target audience. I was more interested in finding out if the NFL player (Tees) made the team roster. I think this show demonstrated the need to get smart with money, rather than how to actually get smart with money.",True
3,5,Most of this was kinda stupid...,VeggieVader,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou can probably learn a thing or two by watching this documentary, but most of it is just stupid. Like the girl with the boyfriend. They are spending most of their money on eating take-out food every day, and wondering why they don't have any money left? Well, start with a big cook so you have food ready for the whole week, problem solved. And what is up with this so called money advisor... She tells her to get the cheapest car possible, but what about other expenses besides buying the car? What if the car breaks down, insurance etc....And I just don't get how a rich NFL player can complain about not having any money when he has more money than most people?! If you don't have a job or any sort of income for a while, then you have to cut down on your expenses, you can't continue living as before.",True
4,7,This was Okay,charunagpal-17929,n/a,16/08/2025,"Okay, so what I believe is this is movie made for beginners who are having difficulties or may be struggling in their jobs like me or may be they are made for something else in their profession so the people commenting bad or negatively about this may be at different level of their financial freedom. For me It was Okay movie because I already figured out my future income source before watching this movie just got pumped up by watching this that am on right path.So big congratulations to people who already have figured out their profession and already at next level of their financial freedom.Cheers to all!",False
5,1,Earn more. Spend less. Duh...,info-50283,n/a,16/08/2025,"Supposedly an ""informative documentary... on managing money"", Get Smart with Money instead offers more reason not to move to or live in the United States. We have a waitress who makes $4000 a month, spends almost $200 a week on takeout, then claims to have no money left to pay for anti-depressants. Which is more damning, that or the fact she thinks the only way to deal with her anxiety and depression is to take medication? Next we have a young mother who is deep in debt with a penchant for impulsive spending and it does not occur to her that she should trade retail therapy for actual psychotherapy. Then comes the NFL athlete who earned more with his first professional pay check than most people on the planet earn in a lifetime crying that he has financial worries. Finally the stay-at-home dad and his life-coach wife whose issue is her curiously skyrocketing income from empowering women and his apparent joblessness? These sound like manufactured difficulties to me and insulting to those facing real hardship.It is difficult to have sympathy for these people because they are so swept up by the ideals of financial and material success in their society that they do not take pause and ask themselves what they actually value in life. Unfortunately, they are no closer to examining their own values and definition of success when they have these dubious experts impose their values on them. If it was so easy making money by investing, there would not be poor people left on this planet. Where there are winners, there will always be losers; for some to gain, others have to lose. This is simply the way the world works. It is ironic that one of them pointed out that money is a ""tool"". If it is indeed a tool, what explains their obsession over it and the idea of early retirement? Instead of taking advantage of one's talents to make money, they could focus on living a self-actualised life led according to one's values. I would argue that it is the collective obsession with wealth that is making Americans mentally unwell. They have so much compared to other parts of the world, but yet remain so deeply dissatisfied.",False
6,3,Shallow reality show offering dubious financial advice,artymorty,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGet Smart with Money is not an educational documentary teaching its audience the basics of personal finance: it's a reality show in which, over the course of a year, four self-appointed experts give questionable advice to a group of financially troubled young people from varying backgrounds and income levels.Tears are shed, lessons are (presumably) learned, and the viewer is left wondering how they got themselves into watching yet another shallow, schmaltzy, patronizing Netflix excuse for a film.The ""experts"" offer empty self-help platitudes along with financial advice ranging from obvious to completely unsound.Among the hilariously misguided suggestions by our gurus, one is offered to an unhappy waitress who dabbles in digital art: accost people walking their dogs and hock your drawings; also try selling NFTs.To a former rising football star with questionable career prospects, the advice is to invest in an S&P500 index fund, and avoid stock picking. When the guy also starts purchasing Meta and Apple stocks, our guru compliments the investment.Not even Peter Adeney of Mr. Money Mustache personal finance blogging fame comes out unscathed: He brags about all the money he's saved by cutting his own hair. The problem is, he didn't need to say that. We can tell by looking at his hair.The triumphant final montage informs us about how these young people's lives were changed for the better after a year: the football star's career prospects improved (completely unrelated to financial expert's help); the well-off young couple is closer to early retirement (tangentially related to financial expert's help); the young mother with numerous credit card bills got a raise (completely unrelated to financial expert's help); the artist/waitress got healthcare from her partner's employment (completely unrelated to the financial expert's help).Thanks, Netflix finance wizard! Not even a whole year after you told that woman to start bothering people picking up their dogs' crap, she managed to get healthcare through her fianceé's employer. Truly inspiring stuff. In the words of the one woman making 200k a year by working as a female-empowerment psychotherapist for three hours a day over Zoom: money isn't everything.",True
7,1,So disappointed that I lost time watching this,kinga-benedek,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hoped until the very end that at least one good advice will be given :( but no.... a lot of clichés and that's it. Waitress who wants to be an artist, the football star who doesn't know how to mange his money and at the end he wants to give back to his community (this was already cringe) and so on. Everybody was buying things from Amazon and that was the problem. They even had a home renovation project included because that sells or they just run out of things to film? It could have been a short film of 15 minutes and even like that it would have been to long :( I don't think I will watch a netflix documentary ever again this aren't documentaries this are bad reality shows.",False
8,8,Negative reviews don't tell the whole story.,manleygurl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI wasn't going to write a review until I read all the negative reviews. I've learned to ignore 1, 2, and 3 star rankings. Or at the very least, read some for context before writing off a show. It's like the negative reviewers here hate Netflix or shows with people that are not just like them. Or the reviewer acts like they know everything, so if someone doesn't know everything then they must be stupid. The negative reviews also conveniently cherry pick things to support their negative review. So here are some positives that I will point out. (Some spoilers)I like the fact that the producers picked a wide array of people with different backgrounds and different incomes. I admit that it was a little off putting, at first, to see people with well above average incomes seeking this type of financial advice. But the more I watched I realized that we all have different goals and that spending money on unnecessary things is unwise, no matter your income. These examples highlighted a real world issue that high incomes are not guaranteed and to make wise choices and decisions while you can.The producers also picked an artist who wanted to make a living with her art, which was something she loved. One reviewer pointed out that she finally got healthcare when her fiancé got a promotion at his job, but the reviewer failed to mention that she had saved a lot of money and she was able to quite her waitressing job. Another negative review pointed out that another person on the show got a raise at her job which made the financial advice she got useless. But the reviewer failed to mention that the person in debt had paid down thousands of dollars of her credit card - debt through the advice of her financial planner.Other reviewers seemed to be angry that the advisers were seemingly regular people (and not some Harvard MBA financial trader) who had found ways to become more financially secure. At first I was a little taken aback by this as well but I believe the producers wanted to show people they didn't need some fancy Harvard guy telling them what to do. I believe the point of this document was that anyone can be smarter with their money, and thereby reduce their stress and anxiety and be more present for their loved ones.One statement, near the end of the show, that pretty much summed up everything was that, in school we're taught to be consumers, not savers. So don't beat yourself up if you find yourself in a bad financial position. That's what we've been taught in America. This show and shows like this can help us see how our choices make a difference and how anyone can do better.",True
9,1,Was this funded by big business?,tzavadil,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIm sorry but this is a horrible way to ""get smart with money"" my favorite part was when the first candidate was living paycheck to paycheck and one of the options by the advisor was renting out a room from Airbnb to reduce her housing costs. This candidate makes no money and this advisor wants them to downsize which it already looks like a studio so great idea there. Transportation wise she lives in a city where you have to drive. She says get the cheapest option for a car to travel but then doesnt bring up the cost of buying a cheap car and how repairs need to be put in your monthly budget and how you then cant travel to work if it brakes down. I only gave this 1 star cause hopefully they paid these candidates to be on this trash reality tv show.",True
10,1,"This ""advice"" is almost criminal",Arie_Kanarie1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel bad for the football player, was given the worst advice ever. He's probably broke by now. Just put all your money in two heavily overpriced etfs at the end of a supercycle etf bubble, lol. That's dead money for the next decade, rather than 10% profit every year. He's now,a year later, already down 20% on his ""investment"", and the worst drop following recession is still to come. The only one that got rich is his ""advisor"", from selling his garbage ""advice"". Dude doesnt have a clue about markets and it shows. Lol, what a joke. Don't follow this docu people, you will get wrecked financially.",False
11,2,Worst investment advice ever,yhzfrmcbwj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can be watched as comedy. But as documentary it is all around an insult to your intelligence if you know basic arithmetics and very basic financial knowledge. And if not, it's misleading and unsound financial advice.Some nuggets of gold from these so called ""financial experts"":Put all your money on S&P 500 bro, you feel me? It returns %10(no, it's not) you will be a millionaire. Google warren buffet bruh, he is the best.Put 8k every month in S&P 500, you will retire as a couple in 5 years(!) with 2 kids (!) and at age 40 (!). (Do you have a calculator?)Bro I bought apple and Facebook shares too! Man you couldn't do better.This documentary was I think shot during the legendary covid bull rally. So everyone seemed happy with profits. My worry is some people watching it now will start deploying all their money to these risk assets unproportionally and get hammered.I also don't understand the dream of early retirement and stop working. What are you gonna do after you retire at age 40? Sit all day at beach? (Probably you can't afford it anyway living off the interest of your s&p500) Can't you do anything useful for the world which you also enjoy doing and can also get paid?",False
12,2,Cherry picking edge cases. Not diverse enough.,diegocomin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Leave to Netflix to make even a documentary about money Something about race. ""Only 2% of black families own stocks"" how is that relevant or helpful at all?They chosen some very edge cases of financial situations. Am ex-NFL player (2 seasons) who spent all his money? Some lady that was already broke and decided to have 2 kids? A ""woman empowerment therapist? That is not the normal and Doens't teach anyone financial freedom. How about interviewing a big city millennial who pays 50% of his income in rent?Netflix makes it about race with a non diverse cast skew heavy towards African Americans, but of course not going into true poor black neighbourhoods.",False
13,9,"Well done, but most won't like their medicine",rstice,n/a,16/08/2025,"We watched this with our two college students home for the summer, it was eye opening for them and made an important impression I hope they carry into their young adult lives. The reviews here are very polarized, love it or hate it. Americans' relationship with money is not unlike our relatinship with food. Basic truths of spend less, save more; eat less, lose weight are the hard truths we don't really want to hear. Most want mindless entertainment to forget problems, not a documentary that challenges their life choices. Mr. Money Mustache should teach a required high school class, entertaining, and espouses a life style that would benefit many as well as our planet. Get Smart with Money is worth your time, but only if you are open ways to think about the world. If you think you know it all, you really know nothing.",False
14,3,"I barely watched it even sped up to 1,5x",petertruelswulff,n/a,16/08/2025,"The good:It is well edited. Especially the intro I found.It has a few good, but general advice like only spend money on what you need and try making your interest or what you are good at your job and maximise your earnings that way, focus on cutting costs on the big thing first like housing and invest on a regular basis on an index fund (the last one is a great advice IMO. I generally use ETF's in a world based index with a low monthly fee).The bad:One adviser recommends doing side hustles and gig work. Surely this point must be sponsored by big business. Maybe you could in the short term work extra to pay of dept, but it should not be a long term plan. Also if your regular work pays better than gig work then do more hours if possibly at your regular job.The documentary seems very setup and controlled. I wouldn't be surprised if many were paid actors and a lot of the footage was reshot many times to make a polished and visually nice looking documentary.A lot of emotional fluff. I am not American so I am not used to all these emotional segments in TV shows and documentaries.My recommendation:
Not a must see, but if you do watch it do it so sped up 1,5x and be ready to use the skip 10 seconds button. Especially during the emotional fluff bits.",False
15,1,Not sound advice,madandemsdaddy,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was hoping this would be good but it's not. These are not financial experts but people telling others what to do just because it worked for them. Ariana with $65000 in credit card debt and making $5k a month was able to reduce her credit card debt by $60k with in one year?? So how did she do this when she is only making $60k a year? The footballer player who had no direction and who didn't finish college was relying on his athletic abilities and that failed him. Also the movie stated his investment account was $40k but when they showed his Etrade account, the majority of his stocks were in the red and a total value if about $12k. The investment strategy given to him was horrible and if you notice, he had stocks where he only purchased 1 or 2 shares. I'm going to show this movie to my senior business class and see if they can come up with solutions for these people and pick up on their mistakes. These so called financial people are making money not because of investmens but rather the product the sell to teach people what worked for them. The attempt was there but fell short. Watch it for entertainment but don't count on getting sound investment advice.",True
16,1,Annoyed,xxfivefiresxx,n/a,16/08/2025,"I forgot it was illegal to give out financial advice without the consultation of a financial advisor. Guess not if you are not Netflix and have the approval of the big banks of the world.This is disgusting, the advice in this documentary is horrible. If you can't do your own research, and figure out how to create three or four incomes on your own... well. Watch this documentary.Honestly, this documentary is an insult to America because of the pandemic. So many of us are in immense debt, (probably the younger generation, who woulda thunk) while the Boomers stay on top.You wanna not be in debt? Make Money? Get ahead?Don't watch this Documentary. Create something. Do something new. This world needs it.",False
17,1,Must Read American Dream,cyics,n/a,16/08/2025,"How idiotic and low IQ Americans has become that they need an Author to write a book on basic financial management which has been around us since ages and did not bother to look at the ""young age"" when needed and instead goofed around and now with so called responsibilities ahead, they are buying a or watching a movie on basic finances on Netflix with a 2-3 screens subscription on their 12-24 months contract mobiles because they don't afford buying on full payment and yet making a median wage a week which is then almost spent on mobile, OTT subscriptions and booze and chill. 🤣 a Fundamental thing to do is develop a common sense...rest all will come in handy.",False
18,10,Great financial advice!,dloaders,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you don't care about your finances, just want to complain about not having money and do nothing about it, read the negative reviews and you will find lots of sympathy.If you do, watch the documentary and pick up what could be used for your own life's scenario.In terms of the quality of the documentary, you have to realize that you won't learn from anybody how do deal with your personal finances because as the name suggests, they are personal. What this video does is teach you about financial literacy, and in this category I have to say it's one of the best out there. From the get go I was skeptic on for how long they would follow up on the various cases they show, since in financial literacy it doesn't work to just give someone advice and expect everything to go smoothly. So following up until one year later is a reasonable amount of time to get an ideia of how its working out.To really show you how to get better with money in a film, they would have to follow these people 24/7 for 5 years, so you realize what the mindset around good financial decisions is.What they have done instead is give you some examples for you to look into financial literacy a bit more in depth if you think it makes sense for you.They should do more documentaries like this, even if it just helps a couple of people at a time.",False
19,10,SMARTadvice,peterhorsfieldcfp,n/a,16/08/2025,"An inch of action will always take you further than miles of good intentions. This movie has great information, and those who apply the lessons not only invest in themselves, they also benefit those important to them.Trust the process, and do the work. Success is from habit and repeatable process on the journey of mastery.The good news is that we are not our past, and every day we have an opportunity to make better choices and do the work needed, to bring us closer to experiencing our ideal life.Anything that helps you have more time to do what you want, when you want, where you want, how you want and with whom you want, is a good thing 👍",False
20,8,A great documentary on the very basics of personal finance.,jwalton314,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a world of nearly limitless possibilities and scenarios that will affect ones personal finances, this documentary follows a select few individuals with different stories of their own.Get Smart with Money is aimed at the most basic level of personal finance but it also tries to relate to as many income levels as possible.If you follow your finances closely and manage your money well then this documentary is only going to serve as pure entertainment for you, as it did for me. There are no new or groundbreaking ideas shared within this hour and a half long video. It was interesting to see the lives of various individuals at different stages in their careers but nearly the same level of knowledge about personal finance.If you are lost in your personal finance journey then this is a good starting point. Latch on to one, two, or all of these financial advisors and learn more than what is shared in the documentary. They only lay out the foundation on what you need to do to fully experience a life changing financial mindset.This documentary definitely worth watching by anyone who enjoys listening to personal finances stories, however, if you are actively against the basic fundamentals then you will be annoyed at the advice given. Typically, the people who I see getting annoyed at basic advice have an unrealistic expectation on the rest of society and cannot see who the targeted audience is. Just because something isn't for you, doesn't mean it's bad for the masses.",False
21,10,Informative and Inspiring Docuseries!,dneveles,n/a,16/08/2025,"The people featured in this series represent real-life Americans struggling to achieve financial stability, freedom and the American dream. I appreciate how vulnerable everyone is with their financial hardships and especially Lindsay with her vulnerability and self-awareness about her anxiety. I found the show to be informative about things I hadn't considered to better organize my own finances. While I know you cannot implement financial advice shown on TV, they provide good frameworks to consider and discuss with a financial planner. I found all of the people inspiring for their hard work in the face of adversity.",False
22,10,Lots of good info,christinecandow,n/a,16/08/2025,Lots to think about here. Americans are just not taught enough about investing and saving in school. Or about entrepreneurship. And Amazon definitely doesn't help things!Not sure why the first reviews were so low. Lots of people seem very negative lately... also how on earth am I going to type 300 more characters? So the artist finding ways to make money with her skills and talents was inspiring. Sometimes you need someone to see the bigger picture for you. What an out of the box idea to combine her love of dogs and art. Mr Money guy should have had a whole show. Or series. People need the basics that he preaches.,False
23,10,Great Watch,johnetteb-21925,n/a,16/08/2025,"To read the negative comments is exhausting. It's sad how many truly miserable people there are in the world. To stand in such profound negative judgment of a show positively profiling people who were brave enough to be publicly vulnerable about something as personal as their finances is repulsive. If you don't agree, turn the effing channel. Keyboard confidence is a disease.As for the show, all of the experts offered a few valuable pearls. Obviously not one size fits all, but the high-level goal of the show clearly is to inspire people to feel confident about improving their financial future. I enjoyed it.",False
24,10,What people need today!,tiagopiriquito,n/a,16/08/2025,"Awesome documentary, reflects the reality of today's society. It is the perfect advise to have more and more people saving avoiding a lot of problems related to money. It is also the best strategy for the general public to create a side hustle or reimagine new income streams. It is not easy to deal with money today due to easy access to credit cards and lack of financial literacy. Schools must pay special attention to teach more financial topics at schools to create a more resilient society. It is capable to change many people lives in terms of future planning in and retirement perspective. Must watch!",False

You do not have to match with the counts and evaluate are they true or not. Simply it's a math formula that most of us aren't aware of.After watching this full documentary I found it very helpful and I think it has inspired me think at least. And it is truly teaches us that first world problems are incredibly basic. For the rest of the world, they simply learned it in advance which benefits them and for their next generation. You can say it's a middle class life style show. But I think it's for everyone and we know that already.",True

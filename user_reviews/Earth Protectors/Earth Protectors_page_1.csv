1,10,Earth Protectors is a documentary like no other.,jchasques,n/a,16/08/2025,"In it, we follow Anne de Carbuccia through her artistic lens as she travels the world and the seas for ten years, visiting often inaccessible locations like Mustang in the Himalayas, Lake Baikal, or Peru. In each of her photographs, Anne creates a symbolic installation called a Time Shrine to honor and capture the ephemeral beauty of the planet, featuring an hourglass to represent the passage of time and a skull to symbolize life's transience. Thus, it is through beauty that we enter into the real story that Anne tells us. We are struck by the beauty and purity of the landscapes through the artist's eyes, as well as by her works that radiate and provoke thought.During her travels, we meet the Earth Protectors, witnesses of this new geological era in which the impact of human activity on the planet has become the main geological and environmental force shaping the Earth. The Anthropocene is now its main destructive force, and these guides are burdened with the heavy responsibility of saving what can still be saved, whether glaciers, a river, a lake, or a forest. The Sea People of Indonesia exemplify this.This is not just another documentary about climate change. The artist's perspective and narrative are not those of an activist but of an exceptional witness, leading to major insights:
1- We have self-centeredly gotten used to referring to our planet as Earth instead of Planet Ocean. 71% of the globe's surface is covered by seas and oceans, and we too often forget what earns it the nickname 'blue planet.'
2- Climate change directly impacts culture and traditions. When people are forced to relocate, ancient traditions are sometimes lost.3- Those who pollute the least are the first affected by climate change; this is clearly seen with the inhabitants of the Himalayan regions or the primeval forests. These peoples have no industry, no combustion engines, no plastics. They are the first victims of global warming.4- Human migrations, particularly those from Africa, often have their origins in this climate disruption, bringing with them a great deal of suffering and horror.5- Plastics: we eat them, we breathe them in, everywhere, every day - surprisingly, microplastic particles have invaded our atmosphere and our oceans.Facing this existential threat, there are still reasons for hope provided we act by developing a collective mindset with different approaches and creating reparative or preventive technologies. We can always remember that these incredible moments we are experiencing are turning points; it is up to us all to take the right turn.Earth Protectors is a true marine and terrestrial epic where beauty meets devastation, and life intersects with death, reflecting human nature. Anne de Carbuccia's documentary is not about activism; it is about the art of seeing things as they are, the best and worst of humanity. Will we be the next Earth Protectors?",False
2,10,An exceptional testament to the climate crisis happening HERE and NOW,josephinedecarbuccia,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is not only an amazing work of cinematography and story-telling, but it also addresses concrete and real issues happening to real people. I find that so many documentaries on climate change lack in tangible examples of how the Anthropocene is affecting and will increasingly affect our planet and its people. This movie is a beautiful exception. I was moved by the stories of the diverse collection of Earth Protectors. I was enlightened by the strong images portraying environments and ecosystems in extremely precarious conditions. All the while, I was reinvigorated by the efforts done by so many communities and organizations, including One Planet One Future, in their fight against the natural, political, and human catastrophes resulting from incessant mistreatment of our planet.Whether you are an Earth Protector, an activist, apathetic or skeptical, this is a must watch if you want indisputable facts about the current status of the Earth presented in a genuine and engaging account of our shared humanity.",False
3,10,A MUST watch!,saratazartes,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie embodies the concept that wherever you are, whoever you are, you can make a difference.By bringing us on her journey, Anne de Carbuccia shines a light on the harsh realities of the climate crisis. She shows us that in the massive world that we live in, we are all connected and through collective action we can mitigate this crisis.Giving a voice and platform to the incredible stories of the Earth Protectors (in my opinion Heroes), allows you as a viewer to feel inspired and connected to people that are maybe miles away from you - a unique feeling. This film gives me hope, which sometimes is hard to hold on to. A must watch!",False
4,10,Outstanding!,mhmugica,n/a,16/08/2025,"A magnificent documentary that feels more like a captivating movie and a real piece of art at the same time! Anne de Carbuccia allows us to travel with her to the most remote places in the world, inaccessible for the majority of us, and meet with incredible people , wild unique animals and amazing natural sites.The film not only inspires but fosters an urge to take action on an issue that has gone unaddressed for far too long.Much more than a documentary, this film is incredibly engaging and uplifting, it does not condemn us it actually motivates the viewer to become active, or better yet to join the fight.A must see!",False
5,10,young people adapting to climate crisis around the globe,at-21643,n/a,16/08/2025,"A voyage in the most remote parts of the world with the Earth Protectors, young people adapting to lack of water in the Himalaya, fires around Lake Baikal, deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon, underground water reservoirs and pumps in Japan..
The voyages is accompanied by short but illuminating conversations with a scientist providing background information and support to filmmaker's artistic representation of the Anthropocene, the new era we are living where humans have become the most important force shaping life on the planet .The touching images of dozens of remote locations add rhythm and a sense of adventure to the viewer.",False
6,10,A must see for the future generations!,mariarosarusmini,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary does not just narrate, it inspires, motivates and calls to action.Thanks to the powerful images and engaging narration I felt like I was going to the places recounted in the film. I discovered that the climate crisis is much closer than the media let on. I was very impressed by the work of the ranger Jared, who often risks his life to protect a forest that he clearly loves and with which he has a deep connection.With their effort the Earth Protectors showed me that everyone has a role to play in the planet's future. It emphasizes the importance of collaboration over confrontation and showcases how collective action can lead to significant environmental victories.",False

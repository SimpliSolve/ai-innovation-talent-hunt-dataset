1,8,Lack of Reviews Here so Adding My Two Cents,gaylordsmythe-higglebott,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat I appreciate most about this documentary is the family's williness to talk about how messy things could be. Having a loved one die, your child die, is horrific. It is hard enough figuring out the right things to say/do in far less fraught situations. This is not a story about noble suffering or this somehow being a trial that betters the people who lived through it. It's much more honest than that.This is a story about Aisha's life (with the largest focus being on how her illnesses affected her circumstances) and her family expressing their grief over the loss of two of their children (Aisha had an older sibling who died before she was born).The home videos, emails, and Aisha's artworks are well edited into the film. Her parents are also good speakers.What brings the score down for me are three things.1) The narrative was pulled into a few too many directions. By trying to cover a wide array of topics the film was only able to focus on a few things. And the things it did focus on weren't always what I wished they had.2) The boyfriend era was not that interesting and I wish they had spent most of that time on other things. Yes, it's great that Aisha got to be a teen excited about romance. But it was a long distance relationship that only lasted a few months and was basically like any other short lived high school romance. Instead I would have much prefered the narrative flesh out what else was going on in her life at that time.3) Aisha was an above average artist and more introspective than most of her high school aged peers....but she was still high school aged. There is talent there that would have been lovely to see develop if she had had the chance to. What this means is that though I felt emotional twings over how much her art reminded me of what it was like to be that age, I have seen autobiographical works about death and grief that resonated with me far more. I'm happy this film exists to showcase her art in a well edited fashion. It just didn't leave me with the urge to read her book.",True
2,10,"Profoundly moving, emotional and gut wrenching!",nandanrakesh,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have seen Sky is Pink, the movie based on Aisha's life. But this documentary is just so much more! There are certain parts of the documentary that are so touching, that it feels as if you can touch and feel what Aisha's parents must be going through and what Aisha must be going through. Having never experienced a loss of a loved one, this shook me to the core and brought me so close to what a loss would feel like and made me experience grief, even though it's not mine. Aisha was so expressive with her writing and her art that it helps you peak into her heart and soul and forces you to empathise with her. God bless her beautiful soul. Both Aditi and Niren pour out their souls in this documentary and take us on their journey with Aisha from her birth to the very last moments of her life with brutal honesty and courage.I understand that there are many families who go through similar struggles and tragedies but this familes well documented journey of their time with their beloved daughter and their trials and tribulations are a must watch for some of us who go about our lives oblvious to all the realities of life.",False
3,10,Absolutely moving,anitasoin,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nobody should pass a comment before seeing a movie. It's an absolutely raw and truthful story that needs to be told not just to emote but to help others on a similar journey. A must watch. Bless Aditi and Niren and Ishan for giving their whole and more for Aisha. The movie is very cathartic and poignant. The Sky is Pink though well made wasn't able to show the emotion and the changing emotions of both Aisha and the parents. I particularly love her love story and that they shared it was wonderful. In her short life, she experienced all emotions from fear and anger to so much love and joy and I look forward to reading her book.",False
4,5,Again???? First pink now black...,sonila-16235,n/a,15/08/2025,I have not watched this so I am giving a neutral rating. But.. how many times will this family tell this story??? A whole movie wasn't enough??? They want to milk her death even more? This is no more about spreading awareness. The movie and other countless interviews done by her family already did that. So whats the purpose of this story to be told again for the nth time???? Money??? I don't understand. Do they want people to once again feel sad for them? Or once again say oh wow what a brave girl??? Like what do they want to achieve thats not already done?? Not going to watch this because there are many other more important stories that deserve our time. Other kids who have died. Other families that have suffered and no one listens to them because no one is making movies about them. This family needs to take a break!,False

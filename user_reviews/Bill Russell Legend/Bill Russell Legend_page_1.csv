1,9,A Comprehensive Tribute to a Basketball Great and Civil Rights Icon,FilmFanatic2023,n/a,16/08/2025,"A two-part film from acclaimed filmmaker Sam Pollard, who brings a comprehensive look at one of the most important sports figures of the 20th century. The film details the life and career of Bill Russell, a basketball legend and civil rights icon who changed the game of basketball forever and created a dominant winning culture in Boston. The film runs for almost 200 minutes, but it's a fitting tribute to a man who was as big in life as he was in height.Pollard seamlessly flows between Russell's on-court performance and his off-court life, with passages from Russell's memoirs narrated by Jeffrey Wright and Corey Stoll as the narrator. Russell was a trailblazer in a sport that was still almost entirely white, and the film includes a ton of archival game footage that shows Russell's mastery on the court. Despite the championships he won and the records he set, Russell was often overlooked and underappreciated during his playing days.Interviews with current and former NBA players, including Steph Curry, Isaiah Thomas, and Magic Johnson, add depth and context to Russell's legacy. The film also includes interviews with Russell's family and colleagues from his Boston years, who shed light on the man behind the legend.""Bill Russell: Legend"" is more than just a sports documentary. It's a tribute to a pioneer, a thinker, and a leader who was aware of the racial weight on his shoulders and felt a responsibility to use his platform for good. The film unpacks what even fans may not have known about Russell, making him more three-dimensional than a highlight reel. Pollard has created a fitting tribute to a basketball great and civil rights icon that will be remembered for years to come.",False
2,7,A Great Player and a Great Man,asc85,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bill Russell was definitely a Renaissance Man for his era. Certainly the greatest winner in the history of sports and because of this, arguably the greatest basketball player of all-time. I knew a bit about Russell's career and life, but this definitely helped fill in some of the blanks.So why did I give this just a ""7"" rating? Well, this documentary made the decision to have an actor read passages from some of the books and articles he wrote himself over the years. This technique was used many, many times, and after awhile, this made it very dry to watch. The other thing I didn't care for is that they glossed over some of the less flattering aspects of his life/career. Russell was married four times, but we were never told that. The documentary suggested that he was a successful coach with the Seattle Super Sonics. He was middling at best. He bombed as the coach of the Sacramento Kings, and quit without even finishing out the season.Finally, I noticed that one reviewer thought this documentary was too woke or progressive. As someone who is politically conservative on most issues, I didn't find that to be the case at all, so if you are politically conservative and hesitant to watch this documentary, I'd say you shouldn't be hesitant. During the era that Russell played, he had to deal with lots of overt racism, especially when they played Exhibition Games down south when there was still segregation. To not talk about that in this documentary would have glossed over a critical part of Russell's life, and the things he tried to do to help change this in American society during that period.",False
3,9,Bull Russell: a giant,Dello_,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being a Celtics fan I was naturally brought to this documentary and I also liked ""The last dance"" (that was on Netflix as well). First of all they are different things both in terms of length and of the overall structure. It is mainly based on Bill Russell the man, both on the court but especially off the court. After the watch you can tell the great leader he was, something that was the main reason for his unmatched basketball success, and how much he was ready to sacrifice in a difficult historic time. I've always known him for those things but discovering the actual facts raised my fascination for the man even more.As a basketball fan I was also fascinated by the representation of the 60's NBA. It is often referred as an era of ""plumbers"" but the documentary shows that in reality they were very skilled and they played a crucial role in the development of the game.In conclusion I think that this documentary is a great watch, especially for NBA fans.

5,8,Legend is an Understatement for Bill Russell,KinoBuff2021,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Bill Russell: Legend"" is long. Its a 2 episode docuseries that both combine to almost 200 minutes. And its all great and if younger viewers can look past the total length they will be drawn to the legendary basketball player and man that was Bill Russell.This series encompasses many things about Russell. Almost all of it strengthens his legendary status and mythos. From his youth to the end of his basketball career, you will see what led to Russell being who he was and why his legacy remains foundational for generations of black athletes after him.My only complaints are how quickly the series glosses over parts in his life where he was more human than legendary, and the large disrespect given to Wilt Chamberlain. But I can see how these two men's public persona may have put audiences to see them as rivals instead of competitors.This series is great and should be watched by basketball fans who may not fully realize the legacy Bill Russell has left. But in truth, anybody could benefit from watching this series to learn more about civil rights, black athletes, and the creation of the sport star.",False
6,6,I Just Can't With The Politics Anymore.,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jeffrey Wright, Lawrence O'Donnell, and a smattering of others brought into this that have hard and fast ignorance on full display at any given time, to discuss the late, great Bill Russell?And WHERE is Michael Jordan? Why is he nowhere in this? Michael is one of the GOATs that needs to be talking about THE GOAT, but he's nowhere to be seen.An otherwise good percentage of people talking about this great man who happened to be the cream of the crop, but you can't just not talk about him and not being Michael, David Robinson, etc into the arena to discuss him.I'm just exhausted by these filmmakers who (wrongfully) believe we will just pretend these nitwits who are here on my screen didn't just call me a (insert dog whistle names here), science-denying conspiracy theorist, because I may not care what their opinion of me happens to be, but I'll be damned if I'll give my hard-earned money and/or free time to them.What a shame- and I am proud to say I'm hardly the outlier here. I'm sure I'll be downvoted, but view numbers don't lie. There's a lot of us who happen to love Russell and watched him play, but we can live with the knowledge of knowing who he was/what he accomplished, and not bother watching things such as this that try to pander to us, as if the past seven years have just magically disappeared.These people who falsely believe that we're going to watch because of who he was, or some mystical 'privilege' forces us to, or guilt can be assuaged need to take a hard look at who they are and the disservice they do to a legacy such is this. See, Bill Russell may have had political views I may not have agreed with, but he, along with a handful of other intelligent people out there, knew what these people can't seem to grasp- even people who don't agree with everything you espouse can be fans, too. Why alienate people who are not your enemy?In years past many of us could set aside differences of opinions in order to view art/work, but we've come to an important crossroads here, and we are no longer willing to casually dismiss targets placed upon us in order to be entertained- I would rather watch paint dry while listening to the grass grow, and I have a feeling Mr. Russell would be okay with that.",False

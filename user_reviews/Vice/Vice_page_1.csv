1,9,VICE finds new home on Showtime,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerVICE (2020 release; each episode runs 30 min.) is the erstwhile long-running HBO TV documentary series that now has found a new home on Showtime. Episode 1 opens with ""Keepers of the Caliphate"". We are in ""al-Hasakah, Syria"", where a huge prison tent city is located, containing thousands of prisoners, including ISIS radicals. The episode focuses on how a number of female prisoners are trying to convert other women and children to the ISIS ideology. Some of the footage is just astonishing. In the episode's second story, ""SIM Kids"", we learn about SIM swaps and crypto thieves. The first story in Episode 2, ""India Burning"", looks at the massive protests by the Muslim population in India following the ""Citizen Amendment Act"" of December, 2019 that officially casts Muslims are second class citizens with potentially devastating effects. The episode's second story, ""Russia's Fight Factory"", looks at the amazing wrestling history in Dagestan (a small Russian republic).Couple of comments; VICE intends to bring us hard-hitting journalism, and that it does for sure. The Emmy Award-winning series spares no effort in taking us to the far end of the civilized (or not so civilized) world. The footage is typically ""in your face"" for maximum effect. Check out the harrowing scenes of the massive streets protests by India's Muslims, with the woman reporter from VICE smack dab in the middle of it. On the other hand, it also feels like borderline sensationalism, rather than, say, BBC-like calm and in-depth reporting. Indeed, the biggest weakness of the stories brought by VICE is that they lack any and all in-depth analysis. Take again the story of India's controversial ""Citizen Amendment Act"": this is brought in less than 15 min., whereas it really deserves and needs much more time (even 30 min. isn't enough).""VICE"" premiered on its new home, Showtime, in late March, and so far we have received 2 episodes, which are now available on SHO On Demand, and other streaming services. New episodes air Sunday evenings at 8 pm Eastern. Despite its inherent shortcomings, I nevertheless find this TV documentary series worth seeking out. If you have an interest in geopolitics and gobal stories of interest, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.*UPDATE 4/13/20"" I just watched Episode 3, which includes a harrowing segment called ""Battle For Idlib"", as we watch rebels in the Iraqi province desperately hang on to the last rebel-held territory while being bombarded by Russian jet fighters. The Russian audio tape makes clear that they are bombing civilians, and indeed at one point a school is bombed, leaving young kids dead and/or wounded, just horrific (some footage may be too tough to watch for some people). VICE senior reporter Isobel Yeung once again risks life and limb to bring us this report that was taped just last month and now already is on air. There is no other TV news show that shows things like this. My sincere thanks and appreciation to Ms. Yeung and the rest of the production team for this hard-hitting and must-see tv report.UPDATE 4/21/20 I just watched Episode 4, possibly the best yet in the new season. Things open with Warning From Wuhan, where we see a citizen journalist report from the front trenches in Wuhan in late January and early February. It features jaw-dropping and harrowing footage from the Wuhan hospitals and streets, with urgent pleas for ""more testing, much more testing"". Where have we heard these very same pleas recently? The second segment is Cuban Hostage Crisis, where resulting from Trump's new asylum policy, asylum seekers from Cuba must remain in Mexico until their case comes up. The Mexican cartels prey on these Cubans, as they are perceived to have more money than other asylum seekers. So get this: Trump's new asylum policy plays DIRECTLY in the hands of the Mexican cartels. Nice going, Mr. ""I Don't Take Any Responsibility At All"".UPDATE 4/29/20 Episode 5 continues the winning streak of this show, and then some. Episode 5 runs 55 min., double the usual running time, and the key segment is Italy's Darkest Hour, on what is happening in Milan and Bergamo, ground zero for Italy's COVID-19 crisis. VICE senior reporter Isobel Yeung once again risks life and limb to bring us this report that was taped just weeks and now already is on air. Absolutely harrowing. We think we have it 'bad' here in the US but it is nothing as compared to what is happening in Italy. And the Stay At Home Order that we have here in Ohio is frankly just a garden party as compared to the complete lockdown in effect in Italy. Frankly I am bracing for the worst, given that Ohio is already reopening its economy starting on May 4, even though there is nowhere near the amount of testing going on that is needed... Meanwhile VICE is showing once again what no other TV is showing. Must-see TV, period.UPDATE 5/4/20 The centerpiece of Episode 6 is ""Three Borders, One War"", and looks at where the borders of Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay physically converge in the so-called Triple Frontier Area, one of the most dangerous places in the world due to the rampant drug-related violence. I don't know how VICE reporters do it, but once again we get perspectives from all sides (police, government, drug lords, etc.). And then there is the incredible footage of the Triple Frontier Area and surrounding areas. Once again, must-see TV that you can't find anywhere else. VICE is now officially one of my very favorite shows on TV.UPDATE 6/21/20 On the Season Finale, two more outstanding and must-see segments: ""Crackdown in Cambodia"" (where the Prime Minister is using COVID-19 as an excuse to round up the political opposition), and ""Last Responders in New York"", a harrowing look at how the New York City funeral industry became overwhelmed at the peak of COVID-19 in mid-April. Words are not enough. I hate to see this season of VICE coming to and end, as it is, hands down, THE must-see TV news program out there.",True
2,2,super bias,ipual831,n/a,16/08/2025,"VICE used to be good. Now it's just another one sided political view shaped bias ""report"". I'm progressive and left leaning. Yet I with talking to people , SEEING, and LIVING issues in this documentary first hand, it's super obvious the show is all about the show now. Topics are not well researched and you can tell there's already a political agenda/narrative before the project(in this case, the tv show) was funded.Very western point of view throughout the whole series. Find a completely normal thing, ruin it, break it down to topics that grab the left, reshape the narrative, fake the storyline over actual truth..etc etc.Annoying. This is why things are so polarized nowadays.",False

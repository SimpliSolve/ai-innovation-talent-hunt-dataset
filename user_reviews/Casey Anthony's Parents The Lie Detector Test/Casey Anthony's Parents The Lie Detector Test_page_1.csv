1,7,Cindy Anthony is guilty and a narcissist,cindyrellaexists,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show sure exposed what a nightmare that grandmother, Cindy Anthony, truly is. Regardless of who said what the fact that Cindy denies Casey her dead daughter's ashes is just brutal. It's vindictive and clearly about her being in control. The father is creepy. This show did nothing to dispel their culpability. Casey has problems and I think most of it is from the mother...Cindy. Cindy is real quick to whine about her PTSD and trauma so she gets attention. Her anxiety attack was laughable. She's like those drunks that get handcuffed while screaming they can't breathe. Yeh ok. Cindy is guilty and continues to control what she thinks she's in control of.",False
2,9,Worth A Watch If You've Followed The Case.,Foutainoflife,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWe all know that lie detector tests are not admissible in a court of law but IMO, they are a tool that can be used to indicate whether someone is uncomfortable with the questions posed and the answers they give due to the physiology behind fight or flight responses to perceived threats.Casey Anthony is a known pathological liar. She was, in fact, charged and found guilty of four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to law enforcement. False information=lies.The thing that most compels my belief that she is responsible for Caylee's death is her absent pursuit for justice. If her father was responsible, why has Casey not demanded justice for her baby?The Anthony's willingness to go to great lengths to prove their integrity is commendable. These people have been run through the wringer all these years and the toll it has taken on their lives is undoubtedly tremendous.There is a moment where George Anthony struggles with a question about whether he knew where Caylee was or if he took part in concealing her death. It makes him seem as though he was trying to hide something. It can easily be construed as a guilty conscience but I do not believe that it was due to him knowing where Caylee was or if he took part in concealing her death. I think it was due to a sense of guilt and blame he has placed on himself for not keeping Caylee safe and not being the one to have found her sooner. Just my opinion.I feel sorry for these people.I have no doubt that they loved Casey but they have suffered and lost their grandchild at her hands. They have also been defamed, used as a scapegoats and harassed due to her lies.Everyone has the right to come to their own conclusions on the matter but I believe the Anthony's are innocent. I'd love to see Casey Anthony willingly submit to a lie detector test and see if she would do as well as her parents did.",True
3,10,"OMG, WHY DID I FEEL SORRY FOR HER WHEN HER DOCUMENTARY WAS RELEASED?",melissawarrell,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI WISH I WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO SOME OF MY FRIENDS AND NOT WATCHED HER DOCUMENTARY!!!All I did was give into her lies and the money she made from making that so-called real life documentary and time she told ""her"" side of the story.NOTHING BUT GARBAGE AND MORE LIES ABOUT HER FAMILY AND WHO REALLY KILLED HER DAUGHTER...HER!!She has and never will take the blame for what she did to her innocent child.I understand why Cindy was being nice to her...she was just trying to find her granddaughter and knew if she upset Casey, she would never tell her, but unfortunately, she never did in the end and I don't foresee her ever saying what actually happened, even though she's been acquitted and could never be retried due to the Double Jeopardy Law.At least her parents conscience are clean and they both know that one day they will reunite with Caylee...she won't if she continues with her lies!",True
4,5,I Get They Want To Sell The Documentary But .....,tadted,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show covers some of the questions we've all been asking but the ""drama"" injected really got on my nerves. The editing is terrrible and misleading entirely for dramatic effect and the guy doing the interviewing is so ""hammy"" in the way he drags his words out! This is obviously a case that has gripped the world because normal humans are obviously enraged when they read about the death of an innocent child. We watched and fully expected a conviction all those years ago but Casey ""got away with it"" according to the opinion of the majority. She then crawled from under her rock and accused her Father of paedophilia against herself and her daughter. As a father I would be furious at such an allegation and would sue the hide out of my child if I was innocent. The question is - ""Is George a monster""?",False
5,1,Don't you know polygraphs aren't usable in a court of law?,ashleylgrosz,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI feel like people constantly forget that polygraphs are not evidence or truth. It's a very old tool that incarcerated a lot of people that have been exhortated since.People can pay to train them how to pass polygraphs. It's not hard if you're able to keep your heart rate low.Courts cannot use them.Let's get real. Her father is likely a part of this. I don't think any of them will ever tell the truth.This is trash. There is plenty of evidence to show that George was a liar and plenty of videos showing that he is insanely manipulative.That woman testified in court that he was having an affair with her EVEN DURING THE TIME THEY WERE LOOKING FOR CAYLEE.That man is clearly a habitual liar.,True

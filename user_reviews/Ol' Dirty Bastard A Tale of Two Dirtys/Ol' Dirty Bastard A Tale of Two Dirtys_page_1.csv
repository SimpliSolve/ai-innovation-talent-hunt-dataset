1,7,Love Hate Relationship,k-30722,n/a,15/08/2025,This was really an ode to him from his family and friends. I learned that he started the Wu. I learned about how the group was affected with him getting high all the time. There is footage of him at awards shows but so much was not included. I guess it would make him look badly. I learned why his wife did not see a dime. She was too young to think about the long term. The manager got a lot of his money it seems. Mariah Carey attended his funeral and was at another event with him. Dame Dash was there as well. His life toward the end was unfortunate. I will never forget the words of his son that weren't included in this. ODB got high in front of his son before he died. His son stated the father knew he was dying.,False
2,9,Raw and dirty... and dirty...,originlove,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you don't know all of ODB's songs and impact on hip hop, and music as a whole, then you may be lost as to why this man is still so beloved and why did A&E choose to create an entire documentary about him. You may miss the forest for the trees. But, if you know then you may not learn too many new details about ODB, the man who went by so many names. There could be a series done about him just where individuals tell their vastly UNIQUE personal stories about him. I'd watch anything there was made on this one of a kind talented man.This documentary includes many of Ason Unique Dirty's family members, the Wu, friends, collaborators and others in the industry, who don't just sit around and only reminisce about the good old days with him. It's the good, the bad and the dirty. It's not a smear campaign by any means because we all knew that he had the disease of alcoholism and drug addiction.He was a man who had a exceedingly brilliant mind combined with a very different type of flow mixed with a tremendous voice that translated into a monster of a solo career and one strong member of The Wu Tang Clan. He deserved his own recognition, which is what this tribute is for us as fans, in this documentary. It's a befitting documentary that transitions beautifully from his early years to his death. Ranging from rapping to family to moments on stage that are unforgettable... truly.His memory still lives on through his music. His legacy continues through his kids, especially his son, Unique, who raps solo and with the crew, wife keeping the estate going, plus the fans.To hear ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" sung by him again takes on a new meaning...",False
3,10,Awesome & Informative,bags-14452,n/a,15/08/2025,A whole new love for ODB... great documentary full of info. I love the info on him being a 5%er. I did not know this about ODB. I did not know of ASON. Loved seeing Mariah Carey actually speaking down to earth. Got me to liking Mariah again. When you come from nothing and love to share because you know what it is - I feel him on that. Not everyone has the same mode tho. I wonder if he had personality disorder tho or he just didn't give AF. I think I'll lean more towards his name ODB. Thank you for a great view of his life! His legacy will continue forever.

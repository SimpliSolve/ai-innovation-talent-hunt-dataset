1,8,Fascinating Documentary,destiny_west,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerMaybe because I am Australian and I would have been a baby when it happened, I had never heard about the Chowchilla kidnapping incident. I was intrigued when I saw it advertised and decided to do some research and then watch the documentary.It is well crafted, with insightful interviews with survivors. I really can't imagine what it would have been like for the children involved, or their parents.It was interesting to hear the different perspectives of the incident, which reveals that the bus driver is not the hero he was made out to be.A documentary worth watching, it is gripping and interesting.",True
2,6,Interesting Documentary But Falls Apart at the End,nlong-92,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie is incredibly attention grabbing for the first hour or so as it follows the story of the kidnapped, their escape, and the kidnappers' incarceration. The latter half of this documentary, however, is quite dull compared to its counterpart. It covers how the kidnappers received parole, the psychological impact on the kidnapped over the years, and the change in societal response since. As much as I can appreciate that CPTSD is a very real and very serious affliction, the way this film approaches it is a bit ""off"" to say the least. By the end I felt like this whole story was used as a way to advertise how far crisis responders have come in the last few decades instead of giving these victims the time of day that they deserve. Results may vary, that's just how I felt.",True
3,6,Chowchilla - *** out of *****,unclejeff,n/a,17/08/2025,"I'm surprised that the strange events of Chowchilla aren't more widely known and talked about, especially in this age of true crime obsession. The brief disappearance of a school bus full of children and its driver in this small California town has to be one of the most unusual occurrences I've ever heard about - stuff like this can't be invented. The sheer oddity of this story automatically makes it worth watching, and it can't help but be compelling, but the documentary itself isn't entirely successful. Whether by choice or necessity, we aren't provided with enough interviews by those who were directly involved, and we aren't provided enough backstory into the lives of the gentlemen behind the disappearance. Certain aspects of what happened are brought up and briefly discussed but not fully realized. I think particularly of a small controversy about the true ""hero"" behind their eventual escape. I realize there aren't always a lot of answers in bizarre circumstances such as these, but I think some deeper investigation and introspection could have made this more of a satisfying watch. I certainly think it should be seen, particularly by those unfamiliar with the crime, but it's not a wholly satisfying viewing experience. - Jeff Marshall,.",False
4,7,Bus-ted Dreams,natmavila,n/a,17/08/2025,"""Chowchilla (2023)"" rolls onto the screen with all the subtlety of a school bus crashing a masked ball, offering an unnervingly close look at the weirdest mass kidnapping in California's history. Director Paul Solet aims to drive us through the twists and turns of the 1976 Chowchilla kidnapping, promising an exclusive ride filled with never-before-seen interviews and revelations. While the documentary aims for a deep dive, it occasionally feels more like a shallow paddle in the kiddie pool, especially when it loses focus, wandering off the road to meander through less compelling detours of speculation and dramatic reenactments that could have used a bit more rehearsal time.The film's strengths lie in its raw, powerful interviews with survivors, whose accounts pack the emotional punch of a thriller novel you can't put down, even if you've read it before. These moments, stark and unflinching, are when ""Chowchilla"" truly shines, providing a vivid window into the terror and triumph of the human spirit. Yet, every so often, this intensity is undercut by a soundtrack that can't decide if it's scoring a documentary or auditioning for a suspense thriller, leaving viewers in an odd limbo between empathy and eye-rolling.Clocking in at a runtime that feels slightly indulgent, ""Chowchilla"" is like that school project that did all the research but lost some points for presentation. It's a 3.5-star cinematic journey that, despite its occasional off-road excursions, manages to bring home the harrowing story of survival and resilience. If you're in for a ride that's part historical recount, part suspenseful escape tale, and part 'why is this music so dramatic?', buckle up. ""Chowchilla"" may not take you exactly where you expected, but the destination is still worth the trip - just maybe pack some snacks for the longer detours.7/10.",False
5,9,Kidnapping Terror,raineday,n/a,17/08/2025,I remember this kidnapping and then you see this movie and you are reliving it with the victims and then you find out the aftermath was just as horrific as the actual kidnapping. I applaud the filmmakers and the ability of the victims to assist in the making of this documentary. I can't even imagine what those children went through and then you realize that their trauma is going to affect them for the rest of their lives. So why does a kidnapper ever have the opportunity to be released from prison when they admit their guilt? The aftermath is what kept me glue to watching this film. I just cannot believe the kidnappers were able to even be allowed the opportunity for parole. What is wrong with our criminal justice system? This movie pointed out the problems with our criminal justice system. Where is the justice for the victims?,False
6,10,I remember,scameronlerer-46951,n/a,17/08/2025,"I'm old enough to remember the Chowchilla kidnapping and this fine documentary is a time machine back to those days. Others have told you about what happened, but I'm here to tell just how well made this motion picture is. The 'acting' in the reconstruction of the ordeal is so seamlessly Integrated into the footage from the 70s that it's easy to forget it wasn't filmed while it was actually happening. The blase inconsideration and incompetence of the kidnappers is breathtaking which makes the ending heartbreaking. Not easy to watch but very important in bringing childhood trauma in focus. Kudos to all involved in making this fine film.",False
7,10,Really terrific,janushouse,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI had a vague memory of this incident. It was fascinating to see the newscasters of that time and the old footage.How little we understood about the impact of childhood trauma in 1976! This was a loving, compassionate, important documentary with excellent interviews of some of the survivors. How quickly the teachers, parents and even the children themselves expected everything to return to normal once they were found. Painful, at times, but enlightening, to watch how the event impacted not just the children, but the children's' families and their own future children.I am so glad to have seen this and highly recommend it. It will stay with me for a very long time.",True
8,2,What A Let Down,kannetidwell,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerApparently, the word ""documentary"" has changed. No longer are film makers interested in telling true stories and digging through evidence, rumor, and bias. I think it's pretty feckless to have a group of paid survivors asked to speak poorly about a man who cannot defend himself. It's one thing to speak ill of the dead but another to tear apart his character probably because he was the only adult. Considering how the majority of those children went on to conduct their adult lives, maybe they shouldn't be the first to cast stones. What makes this style of filmmaking worse is that it relies on a handful on ""memories"" and ""wintnesses"" who were extremely young at the time. While it was nice to hear some different perspectives, the movie read more as a Mean Girls style ""Burn Book"" than a piece of thoughtfully crafted Non-Fiction. This includes the politically fraught and careless manner in which all three perpetrators tried and paroled. If you're a real documentary lover then skip this one.",True
9,10,Justice For Victims,bklane-66510,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerSome are asking where is the justice for the victims, well, here is the answer.This happened in California, a backwards state (that I grew up in), why do I say a backwards state? Because they believe in justice for the accused first, victim last.I hate to say that about any state, but the justice system is very wrong in California.They should have never ever released those boys. But California believes that a pen, paper and a sorry note are considered rehab.If it had happened in a state like Texas, those boys may have been on death row. I won't say thats the right approach, but certainly life without the possibility of parole is right.",True

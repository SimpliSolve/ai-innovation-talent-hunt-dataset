1,10,Amazing Documentary!,samkinnon-31354,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved this documentary. Really great film on the Youth and Government program and a refreshing perspective on politics from a point of view of our youth. It pulled you in, and kept you hanging on until the very end. Each character and their story was compelling as well as relatable. The way the filmmakers shot and created the film was perfect - their close up access as well as their roots within the programs truly brought the story to life. I would love to show this movie to everyone I know as a way to describe to them the importance of this program the impact it has in such a big way. Don't miss out on seeing this!",False
2,4,stark reminder,joberjoberjober,n/a,16/08/2025,"Politics do not change with each new generation, these teens are already indoctrinated with shameful practices of how to run a campaign. Aidan blain just seems like another rich kid from some affluent CA suburb who already had it figured out. I can't imagine the back door scenes that happen during this whole thing. Some these kids already seem like absolute socio-paths.This is only relatable in the way that is what our current system looks like, and these children are propagating an already broken system by participating in this y/g election. They kept saying about how they are the future, they are the future of the same thing.",False

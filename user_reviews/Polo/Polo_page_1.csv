1,2,Some great players but too much irrelevant bs,gary-lachman,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having played polo for approximately 20 years of my adult life between the ages of 25 and 45, I must say that the series completely misses the point. Who cares about a one goal player named Louis who has a bad track record with relationships or an overly aggressive father pushing his son so hard that all joy of a magnificent sport is lost? The interpersonal relationships between players is mildly interesting, but the actual dynamics of a team, it's horses, and it's strategy seemed to have been completely glossed over in this series. Bill Clinton might have repeated James Carville's line, ""it's about the economy, stupid"". But someone seems to have forgotten that with Polo, it's about the horses, stupid.",False
2,2,Pretentious and Boring,erikadelabarquera,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really wanted to like the Polo documentary (well is more like reality tv), it hace some good parts like the father son competitive spirit, but that's about it, no bad but no good either,
The first episode was tough to connect with, because it presents a world that not only isn't very relatable to most people, but is boring to boot,""
I think they try to hard to be like the other sports documentaries on Netflix but the biggest problem is that Polo is not a sport that can connect with normal people, and that's the biggest problem with trying to bring a Polo documentary to Netflix, I am no sure if ever Polo as sport will be mainstream.",False
3,1,Tedious,bicyclery,n/a,15/08/2025,"Doesn't really do any favours for Polo, people featured are rich, self important and ultimately boring, not relatable at all for the average viewer, I think it was aiming to make Polo appealing but for me it failed miserably, animal lovers are sure to be appalled at the seemingly harsh way the ponies are treated on the field. Admittedly the players are skilled and fit but I dont think the show really highlights this , instead trying to make the whole thing glamorous and slick, even my daughter who is a keen horse rider found it boring and repetitive, unless you're a real fan of Polo I would suggest giving it a miss, there are so many better shows to watch.",False
4,1,Truly Awful,johnsw,n/a,15/08/2025,"As someone who followed Polo in England most of my life I was looking forward to this series.But how on earth could Netflix make such an exciting and interesting sport so tedious and so boring?The characters were superficial and self-obsessed. Despite the fact that many polo players are great company and fun to be around, Netflix managed to find not even one likeable character. It was a bit like watching a re-run of Dallas.Fortunately I know where the ""off"" button is on the remote control, and there are plenty of other things to stream, so I did not waste my time by watching the whole thing.What I don't understand is why Netflix (who make some pretty good series) even bothered to stream this truly awful show.",False
5,1,YAWN!,tinkerbellfaery,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHaving played Polo my self, this docuseries is a very poor example of what Polo is, it paints a picture of a game that excludes non wealthy people.Ridiculously all it shows are very self entitled men with no respect nor regard for any one but their fragile stunted egos, and self objectifying women who just seem to grin and bear, and for all the pseudo women's rights and the sort attitude that one of the producers professes, it is a total train wreck.Netflix made a mistake with this one, because with all the negativity surrounding the producers, it would take holy intervention to move the richter scale of approval 0.0009 towards acceptable.",True
6,6,Didn't live up to potential,tarastanhope,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can't quite put my finger on it. This could have been amazing but it failed to live up to its potential. Sports documentaries have a true and tested formula for success which is confusing as to why this failed. Some people are blaming the elite mess of the sport which i thing is rubbish. Look at F1 that is super elite! I feel like they didn't delve into the characters to show their warmth but rather portrayed people as spoiled, rude and entitled which is a shame because it's unlikely to be realistic. I feel like it wasn't produced or directed to its full potential. The idea is there but there wasn't enough connection to the characters. It didn't really dig deep enough. Shame their won't be a season 2 unless they can turn it around.There's also probably a lot of hate towards it just because it was executive produced by Megan Markle. Essentially, it has all the ingredients for the recipe but poor execution.",False
7,1,A Pretentious Prance on the Playing Field,amymaree17,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNetflix's 2024 documentary-series 'Polo' attempts to gallop into the hearts of viewers but finds itself trotting in circles instead. Drenched in pretense, it serves up a cocktail of glossy visuals, leaving viewers feeling like spectators at a lavish yet insipid polo match. With each episode, it manages to turn the sport into a slow-motion replay of itself, lacking the thrill and vigor one might expect. Its narrative aimlessly meanders like a rider who's lost the reins, leaving us with a series as out-of-touch as a misplaced mallet on a deserted field. 'Polo' might aim for the goal, but it simply ends up horsing around, never quite hitting the mark.",True
8,10,Thoroughly enjoyed it!,npvgrkjb,n/a,15/08/2025,"This series takes you through a game that is only popular among the elites. However it breaks it down in a way that allows you to understand and enjoy the games along with the drama as well as ups and downs in the lives of the competing athletes and their supportive families.You get the serious and competitive as well as the struggles of balancing drive and living in the moment whether it be a young adult, an expectant father, a retiring champion, an upcoming champion. I love that I can take the moment to appreciate a sport I've always considered far removed from me. It was very robust, insightful and enjoyable.",False
9,6,Mixed feelings,bonjour-63269,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's always interesting to learn about a sport, particularly when it's not one you follow or understand. This is an opportunity to learn about Polo, it's certainly very entertaining. I think any sport where you have the best of the best is highly motivating even if it's not your arena. I'm just conflicted by what I'm seeing. I appreciate that the horses are the top notch and highly fit but I can't help feeling it seems cruel to the horses. There are many cringe moments when I see in slow motion the awkward movements of the horses or when they collide. I'm not a vet, but it would be maybe reassuring if we understood by an expert the physical and psychological conditions of these horses. Is it just me?",False
10,1,Cruel and totally unrelatable for most,wdntzmfch,n/a,15/08/2025,"Why on earth would Netflix support the filming of, and then actually air this documentary? Tedious. Boring. Totally unrelatable for anyone who doesn't have a spare few million in the bank. Pretentious and cold hearted. The disrespectful and cruel way in which horses are treated appears to be unregulated...Why? Elitism at its worst. I had high hopes and really wanted Prince Harry to show the world what he's made of... sadly he did but not in a positive way. I'd rather sit and watch paint dry to be honest... it would be of more use! I'm sorry but Meghan and Harry have proven that they are out of touch with the real world and have sadly shown the world that actually their 'creative ideas' aren't of any importance, interest or relevance to most people who live in it.",False
11,2,Privilege does not equate to talent,hettyblue,n/a,15/08/2025,"A dull and tedious documentary. This show does not reflect well on the participants. Male dominated throughout. Women are appendages who stand, watch , look pretty and smile. I would have liked more on the history of the sport, the welfare and training of the horses. How are they bred ? Perhaps a smidge of bonding between rider and Pony. Is it purely for the 0.1%? Have people from under privilege backgrounds been afforded opportunities to mix with the sport or is it simply the black Amex club? Production was underdeveloped. I'm just confused as to why this idea was green lit. Surely netflix had much more viable options. Hard to get through the episodes.",False
12,10,Great insight into polo,wxdvrjzmm,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great insight to a sport that I barely knew about. I enjoyed it a lot. Yes it is a sport for the rich but it does give a good view on their lifestyle and how they got into the sport. Just because they are rich don't make them bad people. The spotlight is also on families, their lifestyles. Some funny moments and sad moments. Very exciting to watch. They care for their horses very well, and those mentioning animal abuse it's nonsense. The duke and Duchess of Sussex make a very small appearance but it's not focused on them at all. It focuses on the individual players and their strict regimes. Definitely worth a watch.",False
13,7,What about the horses?,sherillcyrtoo,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched all the episodes and found the personalities of the owners and riders and their families interesting. However, I would have liked a lot more information on how the game is played. What strategies are used to get goals? It was difficult to see anything interesting about the horses and riders running back and forth across the field trying to hit the little ball when I couldn't understand what they were really trying to do. But mainly I wanted a lot more information about the breed of the horses, how they were trained, how the riders worked with them during the games. That would have added a lot more interest to the series. I also couldn't understand how the owners could make any money out of the sport. They must spend an enormous amount on the horses and equipment and traveling and paying the riders, and they certainly can't get their money back from tickets to watch the games as there were hardly any spectators and they don't have television contracts or corporate sponsorships. In my opinion, there was way too much time spent on the games themselves and not enough on the things I've mentioned above.",False
14,1,Promoting the abuse of horses,Nmapstein-22012,n/a,15/08/2025,"For two people who claim they care about animal rights, to promote a sport which severely damages the health of these wonderful animals is objectionable. There is nothing glamorous about it. It is a rich elitist sport which abuses animals. The damage to Polo ponies is well documented now so you cannot bury your head in the sand.The series really does descend into a tacky 'Real Housewives' show. It's a shame that there are no female Polo players shown.I'd urge people not to watch it, it's self promotion at its best with no thoughts as to the ethics of this sport. It's time we thought a lot more about the purpose of the shows we are making/watching. Our entertainment is not more important than the wellbeing of these animals.",False
15,10,Worth Watching,pearsonangelal,n/a,15/08/2025,"I enjoyed it. Didn't know a lot about Polo but this has peeked my interest. I loved the scenes and action plus following the player's and their family and how much they love the game plus the effort they put into taking care of those beautiful horses. The hard work they put into the sport. You can tell their genuine love for the sport and the horses they ride. I hope that we can see more episodes because it had everything in it, a little drama, competition and love of the sport. I am going to watch it again because I did enjoy it more than I anticipated. They did a great job in filming this wonderful compelling documentary about Polo.",False
16,7,Entertaining Reality TV,shurtgen,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't realize this was a documentary until I started reading reviews of people calling it one. I came into it expecting more of a reality TV show, and was happy with it in that context. It's entertaining enough.Thinking of it as a documentary, it's hard to connect with such a niche sport where every player is ultra-wealthy, so don't expect to really connect much with the personal stories. I didn't really find myself cheering for anyone. Same way you don't really cheer for any of the Real Housewives, you just enjoy watching them exist in a completely out-of-touch world apart from your own.The most concerning part of this show is Louis Devaleix, a walking red flag who clearly needs professional help dealing with his emotions.",False
17,1,Far from normal people reality,enitar,n/a,15/08/2025,"An ambitious show about very rich people hobby. I am afraid, I couldn't find much of promised hope in the show, except maybe a hint ""when you become as rich as these people you will be able to play polo, too"". No doubt, polo can be rather attractive and entertaining, however it is very rare and popular in very limited community and social circle, you cannot compare it with much more democratic sports like cycling or football.I have read about horse health problem in polo sport, and I wish this was discussed in the show. I wish I could see the polo players taking care about these beautiful animals, unfortunately I didn't.Interestingly, the world mostly know about polo because of the royals playing it. But we see no Harry participating in polo. Instead I had to watch some unknown guys trying to speak English and explain the polo essence.",False
18,10,Amazing series about POLO!,miarip,n/a,15/08/2025,"POLO is an amazing series shown on Netflix. It is compelling and takes us behind the scenes and into the lives of the players of this amazing sport! I was hooked from the very first episode up until the last!To be honest, I binged watch all the episodes in just one sitting! The highs and lows of playing the sport is clearly showed and one can't help but root for the players because they've given their hearts and souls into fulfilling their dreams.....winning the US Open!!I found myself being teary-eyed, laughing and cheering along with them!! Yes! It is that good!!Looking forward to watching another season of this! Cheers!!",False
19,1,Who on Earth wants to watch trash like this?,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Another disaster from Harry and Megan, the couple who begged for anonymity and freedom from public gaze, torment us with another slice of pomp and sheer irrelevance.We're in a world where people are literally deciding whether to heat or eat, these two think it's the right time to put our a documentary about filthy rich people, devoid of knowing what it is to live in the real world.Who is this going to appeal to, all I can suggest, if you're having trouble sleeping, pop this on, it is truly the most boring and pretentious thing you will ever see, it is painful from start to fish, you'll not be able to binge watch it.We're told that the players and adoring fans are beautiful people, I'd question that, all I saw were an elite of hollow people, who all probably went home to enormous mansions, with not a care in the world.Netflix, please do us all a massive favour, enough with these two now, it's becoming hugely embarrassing, surely they must be costing your business a fortune.A contender for worst show of 2024, it's abysmal.1/10.",False
20,10,Fascinating world of Polo players and their families.,papatsounipagona,n/a,15/08/2025,"Anyone who has spend the summer or part of the summer in Windsor or Gloucestershire or Cirencester, would know the familiarity of this documentary. The horses the polo players, the after parties and the families. Polo is misunderstood as the Sports of the rich but it's really not. In the UK most of the Polo players are professional riding athletes or involved in the military. This documentary deserves to be watched in order to understand what Polo is all about. Prince Harry was amazing on horseback and he is very much missed on the UK Polo fields. He was a star.Also seeing the negative reviews pretty much feels like Harry's and Meghan's haters are voting against it. Give it a try you would be surprised.",False
21,1,Neither this nor that,asfendosman,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is a serious sport documentary?Or is it the Real Housewives of Polo?It can't make up its mind
for example It dives off into a long long sequence based around the ""drama"" of a Rich woman's Baby Shower facing disaster! That's Bravo RHW stuff.Where is the sporting interest in that?It focuses on characters who are basically unattractive for whom it is hard for the audience to feel empathy.The wealthy man who took up the sport at 40 and bought his way into a team ( some men buy motor bikes) and has no ability and throws tantrums at losing.The spoilt 20-something mummy's boy whose mother nagged his father into setting up his OWN team ( again not with much ability.)You don't care about or like these people.It doesn't help the show that Polo is one of those sports which TV finds difficult to capture.",True
22,10,good docu! Provides a good introduction to what Polo is,IamSaraneth,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't know anything about Polo.There is little knowns about this sport.The documentary shows you all sides of Polo:
How passionate people are, the care for the horses, the support from family and friends. Highly recommended. Two big thumbs up.It has everything: drama, glamour,sport, passion, anger, love and much more.Many see it as a rich people's sport (which it actually is). But this documentary shows that there is more than glamor and mimosas.The care for the horses, the support from family, besides high points there are also disappointments. It clearly shows that Polo is very competitive
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex did a great job producing this beautiful documentary.",False
23,1,out of touch,emailtina-75761,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is really so out of touch and so heartbreaking for the horses, there are some things that should be left alone. We do not need to see how the elite have expensive out of reach ""hobbies"" especially when cruel to gorgeous horses, sooooo disappointed in Harry & of course why show himself, this is another show of their complete detachment and unrelatability to the masses and Harry shed that horrid weight you carry so one day the people will accept you again with work and deep regret of the pain you caused to your beautiful family in UK .. Duchess nobody should have her title stripped away as she will not amount to much her ""endeavors"" fail every time as she is so into herself and so fake ... Netflix seriously this contract with this duo what a huge loss.",False
24,2,Probably should have stayed in the stable...,ledarby-56078,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an odd topic to base a series on. Where those involved have clearly seen a gap in the market, us plebs can understand that gap - we're fine with not knowing anything about the sport. There's absolutely no need to make polo mainstream or try to sell it to the masses. Those within the polo sphere don't want masses there, those of us not in the sphere don't want to be part of it 1 not least because there doesn't seem to be anything riveting about any of the people shown in the episodes. I think let's just let 2 very separate worlds coexist without ever mixing, that's fine. Not everything needs to be made equal.I'm not sure what we were supposed to take away from this, but the pace, the shots, the sport, the people, the execution, the extremely exaggerated posing and false bonhomie just don't fool anyone. Polo isn't interesting enough for most folk. And it certainly isn't interesting enough through the lens of 2 former Firm members who add an unpalatable helping of insipidness to the whole thing.This was either rushed through by the couple of ""survivors"" or, polo just doesn't make good watching - or both. Speaking as someone who neither loves or hates the British Royal Family, I went into this with a fairly open mind. Unfortunately I think the execution and the reviews kind of do speak for themselves and make minds up. It's just not good TV and the whole thing feels like the panicked, pretend, faux-natural yawn-athon it clearly is. I think it's probably time that Harry and Meghan chucked in the towel and that Netflix chucked Harry and Meghan.",False
25,1,Shallow,ddknctxzdd,n/a,15/08/2025,"Occasionally stunning photography isn't enough to lift this try-hard docu-series out of the gutter of vulgar materialism and conspicuous consumption it glorifies. This material (not to mention resource) in the hands of a real filmmaker in the tradition of the BBC or PBS could have turned up a winner. What we got was a show to fill an off-off-off-peak slot on the Bravo network - an intellectually empty whimper of narcissism and self-obsession. All that is missing is Andy Cohen popping up with a snarky take. But, if a boozy reality show-style take on lifestyles of the rich - this five ep series might be for you. Netflix knows their audience and presumably there is a market for this stuff. After the first episode I was chomping at the bit - to find a new show.",False

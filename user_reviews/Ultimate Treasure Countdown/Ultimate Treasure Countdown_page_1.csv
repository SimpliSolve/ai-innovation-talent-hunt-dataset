1,7,"Mostly Great, But...",MozaikAngel,n/a,16/08/2025,"In our short attention span, Buzzfeed world, how do you get people interested in ancient cultures? By making a list! Fun and lightweight, just when I'm starting to get really intrigued about an artifact or site, they've moved on to the next one. Especially annoying is how the presenter has to be in every frame. There are many pointless closeups of her face gazing at something thoughtfully while I'm wishing she'd move over so I could get a better look at the Roman road behind her or even at the artifact she's so mesmerized by. And if the show's premise isn't enough to stir you, maybe the zaftig host's barely clad bosom will interest you, which she goes to great lengths to display constantly. All in all, not a bad show (it is Nat Geo, after all) just wish it was less about the presenter and more about the antiquities.",False

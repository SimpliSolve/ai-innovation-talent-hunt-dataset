1,6,A 2020 style concert DVD,studioAT,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is very much a 2020 concert DVD because it sees Katherine Jenkins performing to an empty Royal Albert Hall. Whether she was commissioned to do a DVD before the pandemic/restrictions hit and she had to fulfil the obligation, I don't know, but it does make for a rather odd viewing experience.So there are lots of shots of empty seats and corridors, but when the camera focuses on the great lady herself there is an awful lot to enjoy about this concert, with festive classics galore.It doesn't all work, especially the readings from famous faces, but on the whole this was entertaining.Whether in years to come when we watch it back on DVD/the inevitable ITV repeat we'll want to be reminded of 2020 I don't know.A lot of artists these days don't bother with a live DVD, so it's refreshing that Katherine knows that some people don't want to watch a concert in broken bits on You Tube.",True

1,6,Best of mashup of socially conscious documentaries from the past decade,severajaaho,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film is a combination of societal documentaries done in the past decade. It presents a critical outlook on the global economic system (Inside Job from 2010 and the forcaster from 2014), discusses it's effects on people (Push from 2017), critiques the ultra rich and their effect on the society (generation wealth from 2018), interviews young activists who are aiming for a regime change (The Square from 2012, How to Change the World from 2016 and Joshua from 2017), and also has an overarching somewhat bleak narrative with a call to action as it's core message with some footage of nature as well as an environmental perspective (David Attenborough a life on our planet from 2020). Overall this film is ambitious in it's scope in attempting to weave all the stories and the whole picture together, maybe at times to the point that it can loose its coherency. It has a normative undertone in that it asks relevant and important questions while also attempting to push people to be more active, though it does not give very clear answers towards where. In a way it's a mashup of ""best of"" documentaries with social commentary from the past decade both in it's form and also how it looks, but does not provide anything particularly new or revolutionizing as a documentary film or as a story.",False
2,10,Incredibly important and well made,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary, by a great and relatively upcoming director, is one of the more talked about and best of the year.It delves deep into every day struggles, the everyday corruption and the overall treatment and relationship between the poor and the rich.It is very nicely paced, cut and edited. Very expertly and beautifully put together, and with lots of interesting observations and discussions.Overall, certainly a fine film with very important and profound themes, that I would highly recommend. It is definitely one of the best films of the year for sure, and one that everyone should watch!",True

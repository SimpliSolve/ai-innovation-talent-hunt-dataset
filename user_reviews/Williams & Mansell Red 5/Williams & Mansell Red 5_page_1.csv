1,9,The Rocky of F1,b4rochoc,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's really that simple for me. Nigel Mansell was the Rocky of F1. I'm not taking anything away from his natural talent and skill. But you need to understand that he came from nothing. This isn't the typical F1 driver path. He had raw talent and unbelievable grit. He climbed mountains to get where he did. On the cusp of many world championships and luck just didn't go his way. He was the people's champion, especially for the British. Adored his wife (she was literally his rock) and his kids. Arguably one of the most gifted drivers of all-time.This documentary does a great job of showing you who Nigel is. It seems the only person that didn't like him was Nelson Piquet. It opened my eyes to how nasty he was. So called ""Playboy"".I enjoyed this from start to finish. It wasn't perfect. What is? But it brought back great memories and was very nostalgic. He came from an era of the last of the true F1 racers. Mansell is such an emotional guy and you can't help but think emotions fuelled many of his races. He loved the fans. He wanted to give them something to celebrate. But as usual, you'll see the typical British tabloid doing what they do best. Tearing celebrities & sports stars down.I think this could make a great movie. Mansells story is as good as any F1 driver. If you love motorsport, especially F1. You'll enjoy this. If you're a gen X or boomer F1 fan, you'll properly enjoy this.",False

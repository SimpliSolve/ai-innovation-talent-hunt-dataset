1,8,"Repetitive Topics and Information, But Cats are Always Cute",jack_o_hasanov_imdb,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a cat dad and cat lover, I liked it. There was information I already knew. But I also learned new things. What am I doing right? What am I doing wrong ? Cat videos were also good. It's always beautiful anyway. I tried to watch it with my cat, but he didn't want to watch. Cat experts dive into the mind of the feline to reveal the true capabilities of the pouncing pet in this captivating and cuddly documentary.A good jumping-off point for prospective cat people or veteran cat people who want to learn some new things about their furry friends. One of the things that the research, which the experts who were interviewed acknowledge has lagged behind dog research by about 15 years, has tried to show is that putting dog-like expectations on cats has been a mistake humans have done for a very long time. Cats do show affection and loyalty, but they're not there to please their people, like dogs are.",False
2,6,Cat 101,dannylee3782,n/a,15/08/2025,"Interesting facts I learnedCats DNA have changed relatively little for tens of thousands of yearsCats flexible spine is what makes them so athleticCat research is 15 years behind dog researchCats like tight spaces hence boxes59% of cats in US are obeseWhiskers are like sensors that are about the width of a catPurrs are in the same frequency range as baby cries (400-600hz), which suggests that it's an evolutionary trait designed to make humans care for catsFood may not be the best motivator for catsCat hunt was a real thing alongside with hunt and some believe this could have contributed to the Black PlagueHumans cultural difference can be reflected in their catsAs a relatively new cat owner who always felt like I was an inadequate owner, I think this documentary helped relieve some of that feeling by reinforcing my knowledge. I don't think the documentary is suited for longtime cat owners as it doesn't reveal any groundbreaking information so they might find it quickly boring like cats do. However, I think it's a good primer to people who don't know cats but are willing to get to know them more. In that sense, I think it's quite an informational documentary given it's running time of 1 hour.I also felt that while the documentary covered a breath of topics, it rarely dove deep into one, maintaining its introductory level. This is quite understandable, hinted by its target audience and purpose but you should not expect a deep dive into the ""mind"" of cats as suggested by the title.Overall, a good watch, best for new cat owners or people who don't know much about cats!",False
3,7,Scientific kitties!,rcr-37510,n/a,15/08/2025,"This really wasn't as bad as some reviews are making it out to be. I quite enjoyed it. I'm a cat lover and there are many cats in the family. The Egyptians worshipped them for a reason. Cats are such regal and majestic animals.It was interesting to see which experiments are being performed and how the results are reshaping our views of domesticated cats. I learned a few facts that I didn't know and their experts offer helpful advice on how best to nurture a good bond with your cat within their biological and emotional capabilities. It's worth taking notes.On top of all the educational stuff there was the benefit of meeting many kitties! Pretty girls and handsome boys who work to keep mice out and live on Navy ships.I have a complaint about that one lady. The speaker on the topic of cats in Medieval Europe. She definitely had some kind of axe to grind and veered off topic into a weird, aggressive, hate-tinged tangent of misandry. Completely unexpected and uncalled for. Very unprofessional. For that I must deduct stars.Still, the overall documentary product was well made. I would recommend it to anyone who likes or owns cats. And the runtime was perfect. At only an hour long the pacing kept my interest.Great job.",False
4,6,Nothing a cat owner doesn't already know,mknauer51,n/a,15/08/2025,"Its ok, i mean it's more for people who want a cat and never owned one before. Anyone whos had a cat or grew up with cats knows all the information that will be in this movie.",False
5,6,"Moderately interesting, if a little cutesy and overly long",j3thr0s,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary taught me some things I didn't know and helped me understand my cat slightly better. However, it dragged at times and the volume of information disseminated could probably have fit into an episode of Explained.",False
6,6,You still can learn alot about your feline!!!,li0904426,n/a,15/08/2025,"I grew up surrounded by dogs all my life but 20 years ago, I got my first cat. I didn't have much option as he was left at my door. My opinion about cat changed dramatically since then, cats are smart, caring, independent and a very good companion. This documentary just reinforced that, but I also found it very informative, especially the meaning of their sounds and some behaviour. I really don't think this documentary is just for the first time cat owners, you still can learn a lot about your feline, unfortunately I no longer can observe my cat.",False
7,10,"I was a dog person, after this documentary I'm getting a cat ðŸ˜¸",gen86,n/a,15/08/2025,I somehow started loving these magical creatures much more than before. I thought dogs were smarter but now I think they are pretty equal or even more.,False
8,10,Awesome documentary,angelaw-69401,n/a,15/08/2025,"There needs to be more of these! This was super informative, and I learned a bunch of stuff I didn't know - and I'm obsessed with cats lol. I'm so happy there are people in this world that realize the importance of cats.",False
9,n/a,No rating,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was decent. I was enjoying it for until halfway through. Why does Netflix feel the need to introduce social commentary in everything they do? I'm done. I don't care about people's opinion of religion, or witches. I was interested in cats. Also, whenever I hear people talking about ancient history like they were there, I can't help but think that someone decided they knew what dinosaurs sounded like. This documentary would have been better if they just did away with the historical social justice perspective and just showed kitties. It keeps telling me my review is too short. I ran out of things to say.",False
10,7,Why we love cats (and they love us back),paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Inside the Mind of a Cat"" (2022 release; 67 min) is a documentary that examines cat behavior and aims to explain how cats think. There are a number of talking heads that walk us through these issues, but the real stars of this documentary are of course the cats themselves. Along the way, we learn and appreciate a number of aspects about our furry friends.This documentary is written and produced by Andy Mitchell, who has a long track record of documentaries with/about various animals. If you are, like me, a long time cat lover (I've had cats for well over 3 decades), this documentary is almost certainly going to please you and entertain you, even if you're really not learning anything revolutionary or new as such about cats. One of those ""revelations"" is that cats pick up on our feelings, and if you love them, they almost certainly will love you back. Really? I could've told you that 30 years ago!""Inside the Mind of a Cat"" was recommended to me by Netflix based on my viewing habits. I really enjoyed this, certainly more so than ""The Secret Life of Pets"", which I also watched recently. If you are a cat lover, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
11,10,You will learn something new.,estelle58,n/a,15/08/2025,"For those giving this less than a stellar review because there is nothing new here, I beg to differ. I have had several different cats, and some of the things pointed out here that all cats do have different meanings, and I certainly did know what they all meant.And I guarantee most will not realize all that cats can be trained to do. Some pretty amazing stuff.Also, if you love the ""wild"" critters like I do, you will most definitely enjoy this, because they always so much fun to watch.",False
12,7,"If you are a new cat owner, or thinking about getting a cat, this documentary is for you.",VeggieVader,n/a,15/08/2025,"I already knew about most of the things that this documentary brought up, since I have two cats myself, but some of the information was new to me. It was also very enjoyable to watch.Some documentaries these days are way too long. This one I wanted to be longer, or several episodes where they can explore different topics, like different cat diseases maybe? Also I would like to see a lot more about the psyche of cats. I think that cats are often misunderstood, especially when it comes to loyalty and love.If you are a new cat owner, or thinking about getting a cat, this documentary is for you.",False
13,3,Enlightening... for the first time cat owners.,talbotphoto,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you lived with cats, gave them any thought at all and did even the slightest bit of your own research, you will learn nothing new from this movie. That ""cutting edge research"" they keep promising from the get go? They never deliver on that promise. Instead, you get a lot of fluff, tons of ""funny cat"" videos collected from various sources, some very basic interviews with cat owners and trainers... suddenly, a misandristic rant (what's up with that?), more fluff... If you know your cats, at the end of the movie you will be mildly entertained and equally mildly annoyed.I recommend this movie to the first time cat owners only.",False
14,6,"Decent, but I forget that every Netflix show has an agenda",mattstenson,n/a,15/08/2025,"The show was great, informative but as a cat owner, nothing was new to me. Every topic in this show could be easily found out through personal experience if you own a cat. A lot of these 'breakthrough discoveries' are just common knowledge.About 3/4 of the way through, the stereotypical old cat lady with nothing in her life besides her career starts harping on about men oppressing women in the Middle Ages. This is a documentary about Cats, let's leave the PC nonsense out of it please.I don't know how much longer I can bear watching Netflix, it seems like every show is now pushing some sort of agenda.",False
15,7,I didn't learn anything new but still enjoyed watching cats.,deloudelouvain,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary will please people that love cats. The slow motion pictures of different cat behaviours were very well shot. Let's face it, cats are just adorable creatures to watch and in this documentary they understood that. But when I watch a documentary I want to learn things and in Inside the Mind of a Cat I didn't really learn much new things. But then again I've had cats for my entire life so I kinda knew most of the things they explained here. It's still good to watch though. Like they said at one point in this documentary videos of cats are the second biggest thing people google nowadays. Watching cats has a relaxing effect on people, makes them smile and be happy, and that's good enough to me to watch this documentary.",False
16,6,Ok but spoiled by PC rubbish.,aleeeeecs,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was expecting more science/facts/studies and fewer opinions, especially a political opinion halfway through, when the cat documentary suddenly turns into a point about how smart women in the Middle Ages were persecuted by churches led by men. Really unnecessary and regardless of whether that's true or not, it's just out of place and felt like those subliminal millisecond messages that are played in-between frames to try to influence your behaviour. Will probably cancel my Netflix subscription after this, as I'm tired of being treated like a subject that needs brainwashing at every opportunity there is.",False
17,10,Great documentary,vixen-pg,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found this very informative being a cat owner myself. A lot of things I did not know about my cat. I think a lot of people have misconceptions about cats, this documentary crushes most of those misconceptions. Cats are ver smart and intuitive animals. Really love how well this documentary was done with so many experts giving very good advice about you and your cat.",False
18,6,Fun cat doc but too much evolution garbage!,steveykaeb,n/a,15/08/2025,"A good watch and fun, however, without them even trying, their naturalistic worldview just sort of, ""spills"" into most of the so called ""science"" that they state. Evolution is NOT truth. If we say amazing design, than please give credit to a creator, not a random process! Evolution implies random process over ""millions of years"" we have ample evidence to support intelligent design, besides common sense, amazing design in animals and humans only points towards a designer, not ancestors that we evolved from. Cats are cats, dogs are dogs, with adaptations over time, yes. Not changing into other species.",False
19,9,"Super cute, super informative",marayabidjerano,n/a,15/08/2025,"Cat experts are going to say this doc is too basic, but this doc isn't meant for them. It's meant for people who don't know anything about cats, first-time owners, and cat skeptics. I admit, I always compared cats to dogs, but this doc gave me a new appreciation for them. Plus, there's funny cat videos in it as well. Highly recommend as an easy watch.",False
20,6,A Cat Love Story,pandora1988,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is not really a documentary about cats and their behaviors but rather an homage to cats. There is a little bit of delving into the psyche of cats and their empathetic abilities and their learning abilities. It was enjoyable enough, and I really loved seeing so many feline personalities. I will say that it would have been very cool if it actually had some new and updated information. There was nothing in it I didn't already know except maybe that Japanese cats have different personalities than American cats. Overall, it's not a bad watch but don't go in thinking you'll walk away with cat enlightenment.",False
21,8,Interesting and Entertaining,crystalbauer-01044,n/a,15/08/2025,Cute movie with adorable videos of cats. It has some interesting facts about why cats act the way they do and how humans have come to love them. Very endearing. I can see why cats are the predominant pet across the globe.,False
22,6,only ok,killercharm,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a documentary about cats that offers little in the way of new or interesting information. It has cats in it though, so I can't help but give it a passing grade but just barely. Even the cats are kind of ho-hum, and that's nearly impossible. Some of the experiments are interesting but we all know that our cats won't fall for such tricks. The acrobat kitties are wildly endearing but make for an only so-so movie that is supposed to be about the workings of a cats mind, not the people who live with her. For 2022 I expected more information that I had not already learned from shows years ago.",False
23,4,If you have a Cat don't bother watching,gcrg-14709,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have always had Cats. All different.This doesn't show any Cat Owmer anything new.Very disappointed tbh. Thought there would be a scientific approach not a fluffy one.I don't want to learn how to get my Cats to jump through a hoop, but why one of my Cats won't use a Cat flap but the other one does it in from of her, why the penny hadn't dropped?Why my other cat goes almost ""Ferrol"" in the summer, so many questions?Suppose if your new to Cats this is fine as a starter but once your a Cat Human you want the obvious. If Cats have been with humans as this Documentary states for Thousands of years that should be a clue.",False
24,10,Inevitably...,dierregi,n/a,15/08/2025,".... since I am a cat person, currently being owned by two cats, I am a sucker for everything about cats. Besides, this documentary was interesting and quite funny and I learned a couple of things I did not know, or rather they confirmed what I thought about cats actually liking their ""owners"" and knowing their name but pretending not to.I knew already about whiskers being useful to gauge the size of an entrance and feel sorry for those overweight pussies who believe they're still thin, as indicated by their ""measuring tool"", but who end up stuck in some hole. An overweight cat is at risk of many diseases, just keep them well fed but don't overdo.",False
25,10,Charming,msftabb,n/a,15/08/2025,Lovely show about cats in general. The trained cats were amazing. Of course to those of us who love and respect cats they're all terrific. Can't understand the negative reviews.,False

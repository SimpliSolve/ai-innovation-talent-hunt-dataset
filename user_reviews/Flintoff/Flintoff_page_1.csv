1,10,Inspiring.,jeffstevens38,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAt times this documentary is hard to watch as the injuries sustained by Andrew Flintoff are shown.His journey of recovery, is to me an inspiration.His original fame and success as a cricketer are almost put in the shade as we see his resolve to overcome his physical and mental scars.His return to the world of cricket enabled him to put his life back on course in familiar surroundings.,away from the glare of intrusive media .It also shows that the support of a loving family has also encouraged the improvement to Andrew's physical and mental well being.All in all this documentary us a timely reminder of how we can recover from life's bumpers.Good luck for the future ""Freddy""",True
2,10,Freddie Flintoff after his accident,maurs-10854,n/a,16/08/2025,"A captivating story of Freddie Flintoff, England's test cricketer and star of the 2005 Ashes win by England v Australia. The movie shows Freddie being filmed months after he sustained horrific injuries after a car crash while filming a scene for Top Gear.We in Australia didn't hear too much about Freddie Flintoff other than he had been in a crash. OMG so sad to know Freddie has been struggling since the accident. He has worked in Australia on many occasions and is well liked here. The film gets to the nitty gritty of his cricket career. Highs and lows. A very honest depiction of an incredible cricketer but also a commentator and natural entertainer. Good luck Andrew Freddie Flintoff.",False

1,7,DDecent but ultimately Flawed,Phrankentstrat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Many great and iconic drummers are here. Some interesting stories but to have a documentary about rock drummers and not to include probably the best that has ever been, Neil Peart, is almost sacrilegious. It's a doc about great rock gutiarists and never mentioning Eddie Van Halen, Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, or Eric Clapton.I enjoyed it but give it a 7 for for an outstanding omission. Maybe a follow up with a full documentary for Peart would be a nice thing. It's definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of music especially more of the Grateful Dead stuff as it's Bill Kreutzmann's son whose creation this is. Enjoy it for what it is, but I was a bit disappointed.",False
2,6,"Mostly nostalgic and very personal, title seems inadequate",mario-marschall,n/a,16/08/2025,"This seems to be movie for drummers and music lovers, because it seems to be a movie about drumming. That's here, of course, but it is more of a backdrop for the personal quest of several people to understanding their drumming fathers like Bill Kreutzmann, John Bonham, Ginger Baker, Phil Collins and Keith Moon. There are some nice and even some great moments on the instrument here, but then again there are many personal stories of loss and heartbreak that don't seem to follow any clear path in storytelling. I did enjoy the ride, but it does leave me disappointed, because the advertising and trailer suggest a different movie, that I would have liked to see.On the other hand this has one of the last appearances of Taylor Hawkins plus Ringo Starr, John Denmore, Stewart Copeland and other legends and that is a lot of fun, so I still recommend it.",False
3,10,Amazing Movie,vvjksskkx,n/a,16/08/2025,"There have been several new movies about drummers, but this was by far the best. The movie has epic content, with interviews that kept me engaged and I was impressed with the selection of drummers.The Taylor Hawkins interview must have been shot right before his death and is moving. Ringo, John Bonham, Keith Moon and Billy Kreutzman! What a line up of diverse drummers and my favorite Jon Fishman!!!While always aware of drumming in music, this movie shines a spot light on the drummers and a fascinating film.It is directed and edited well and keeps you wanting more. Highly recommend this above all others and a must see!",False
4,9,great encyclopedia...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Into past and present drummers of the world, loads arent mentioned here in this documentary, like my all time favourite billy cobham, and the rythmstroker of the german band called ''can''(halleluwah is the song every drummer should listen to), and that is a pity but a great pleasure to see densmore of the doors still out there.Its most the dreadful dead that churns the disco, cause the director is the son of the bands drummer, but its a nice fill in for all music related and other ad/hd'ers with sticks in their fingers, that has this immortal drive to make a sound out of anything. So the grumpy old man recommends.",False
5,10,Excellent and necessary movie,orsabel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent and necessary movie about the heartbeat of any great band. Must see film for any movie lover and music historian. Well done movie that makes you appreciate great drumming and what it meant to some of the greatest bands. The insight into the world's best in the business is something that you will love to learn. Each personal story of the greatest drummers was so cool to learn. Every kid that ever had a drum set can really appreciate this film and their stories. And who didn't want to be a drummer in a rock band when they were s kid? Well this is the movie for you. Enjoy, kick back and see what you missed. Just loved it this film.",False

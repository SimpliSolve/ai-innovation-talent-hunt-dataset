1,7,Hilarious,ShadowsBeneathTheLight,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm surprised to see this so poorly rated. I am a big fan of Kevin James and thought it was funny. Unlike a lot of ""modern"" comedians, Kevin Doesnt bother being political or telling ""safe"" jokes. He's never offensive either, but he calls out easy current generations have it and how soft our society has become. Kevin is older now with kids, so naturally his comedy reflects this. Kevin has also lost a lot of weight from his The King Of Queens days, and it's great to see him branching out from of his food and fatty comedy now that he takes care of himself. My only gripe is he spends the last chunk of his comedy talking about the wife, and while not offensive or anything, it just drags on a bit much that it's no longer funny.",False
2,6,Very Funny Stuff,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,15/08/2025,"I never watched King of Queens when it was a hit show. I know he grew up in my neck of the woods, but not much more than that. I am not normally a big fan of Kevin James' standup, but this one is very good. He does a good job of talking in a relaxed and natural manner about parenting and about growing up in the 1970's. He manages to be very funny without being vulgar, or sexual. His storytelling ability is very good. I enjoyed how self-effacing he was. He does a good job of managing the stage and the audience. He has matured into a very good storyteller and a very good stand up comedian. I enjoyed it.",False
3,7,Laughed a lot.,tgregg-71893,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI think people should expect older comedians might talk about ""back in my day"" things. We did drink from garden hoses and corporal punishment was a thing. In school too. Some of it is BS. Drinking from a garden hose didn't prevent allergies. If his kid's little league team doesn't keep score, it's T-ball. Little league people are some of the most competitive a-holes I've ever seen. But he stayed away from some of the stuff other comedians can't seem to, like gender related stuff. Anyway, I laughed quite a bit and mostly enjoyed it. I've turned off other specials that went too hard on ""how things used to be"". Sebastian Maniscalco is a great example.",True
4,7,Family TV episodes in comedy club format.,JerryrFlanagan,n/a,15/08/2025,"I prefer to see Kevin in TV and films. However, watching him in standup comedy format is fantastic as well. The comedic stories were entertaining and sounded more like family TV episodes in comedy club format. I guess the other episodes will be in the same format. We'll see. Loved the intro walk-on music. He comes on stage like a boss in smoke but has trouble breathing for the first 10 minutes. I have been a fan of Kevin James for 15 years, enjoying his unique style in shows like King Of Queens, Kevin Can Wait, and his family-oriented Hollywood films. The ending with all the fans and producers is wonderful stuff! His last two movies have similar type endings. Fun, festive and lets all party like regular human beings in life type of vibe.",False
5,6,Kevin badly needed a pop filter.,MiloSuperSpesh,n/a,15/08/2025,"The mic he used is terrible , for what reason ? Nostalgia ? Low budget ? Someone couldn't be bothered to give him a modern mic ? Should have had a lavalier mic clipped on and thhis old style mic used as a prop.So for me the constant breathing noises popping and messy audio completely ruins the humour potential.The volume is all over the place, seems the audience were a bunch of seals for laughing at litterally nothing.Jokes wise ? Humour is subjective and often unique like a finger print, ageing bald guy talks life, death and history.I found when he's quieter and more calm he was funnier than his wild physical attempts at humour.It's quickfire either from bad editing or they gave kevin a adrenaline shot before he walks on.Not his best not his worst.",False
6,3,Get Off my Lawn!,KyleMorganAuthor,n/a,15/08/2025,"Somehow Kevin James went from the self depreciating sense of humor, to the approach that kids these days are lazy and parents are wimps. It's a bunch of old and tired rants about drinking from the garden hose and getting whipped with the belt by your old man. And then just an overly long complaint about how his wife talks too much. But the sad truth is that these jokes are as lazy as this next generation. There were very few personal stories here, and each punchline was stretched to make the material last an hour. There were no jokes about food, or material about going bald, or losing weight. I finished it out of respect for Kevin James because he's made me laugh so hard through the years that he's earned it. But sadly, there was nothing special or very funny about this new material. It needed to be retooled and polished before the special was made.",False
7,7,"Better than this thinks they are woke Generation Z- or Alpha now? What, Beta?",ASuiGeneris,n/a,15/08/2025,"I dunno why this doesn't have more love. Maybe because he does slightly insult all our young new viewers and all this teaches me is that I am getting too old? Last I checked, millennials were barely being born. Now Generation Z has already, completely unbeknownst to me, transmorgified not once, but twice, into (Please wait momentarily while I Google this, my neuroses scrambling in anxiety of the unknown alongside the thrill of learning something new- what comes after Z? The apocalypse? Oh, what? Generation Alpha? And that's already over?) Generation Alpha and Generation Beta!Tangent over, this is certainly better than the mediocre ratings would have you believe.No, it was not amazing, but there were a lot of good laughs and all the bits were engaging and funny, if not roll around hilarious. Which is better than only a few really hilarious posts with mostly boring lulls, like the average comedy special. Consistently good > Sporadically great.Not to mention, it was physical standup comedy with masterful sound effects. More rare than it ought to be.TLDR? I liked it. I am rather hard to please.",False
8,2,Oh boy Kevin,paulcouchoud,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a fan of Kevin's for many years I was shocked at how funny this special was. Starting off with a horrible premise about prediabetes and how we're free everything really was not that funny. We all understand the pre-diabetes means borderline and then he kept going on with the premise and then he went on to tell this story about hitting a deer in the same Cadence and story as Kevin Hart did with the raccoon. Felt uninspired, flat, unoriginal, and just not funny. Whole point of Comedy is to make people laugh and he failed in this one. He must be surrounded by tes men, as if he would have appeared review this with any of his other comedian friends they would have told him it was complete garbage. I feel bad for him.",False
9,3,Sadly not funny,hotseatotsie,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm a huge Kevin James fan. I could watch King of Queens every day for the rest of my life. He made me laugh so hard on that show, constant entertainment. So I was really excited that he had a new stand up special and I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I think I only laughed once. I probably smiled a couple of times but that was it. It just wasn't funny. It wasn't that I was offended, as some other reviewers suggest. I just did not find it funny. It was mostly jokes about parenting that have already been done a million times and just wasn't anything fresh or interesting. He wasn't even funny with the physical bits like he was on KoQ. He seemed to be trying way too hard and I missed that effortless way he used to make me laugh. It's a disappointing no from me.",False
10,10,Funny and clean,jeremycholder,n/a,15/08/2025,"Kevin brings his goofy personality to the stage, it's what most love about him. He takes some of the mundane and makes it funny. It's a clean bit, personally I think it's why the critics didn't give better ratings. The end could've hit a little better but it still had the effect desired.Bottomline, Kevin is your guy next door, and your pal you goof around with to blow off steam and watch a game with. It's kinda what he's always been, he didn't try to reinvent himself, some would call that predictable. In this case it's refreshing.I hope that people will give that a chance. I hope to see more of Kevin doing this in the future.",False
11,2,I thought he was better than this. I really did.,pessimisticviewership,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI've always loved sitcoms, and King of Queens is a personal favourite. It has been ever since I first watched it so many years ago. In fact, I still watch reruns regularly, and sometimes fall asleep with it on. It, or other sitcoms.I even enjoyed a couple of Kevin James' movies.This is why, when Amazon Prime recommended this comedy special to me I watched it right away. I'd never heard about it before, and was excited to watch it.Well, that was all for naught.I expected to laugh a lot, but I maybe laughed once during the entire hour or so. It didn't seem like the crowd even laughed much, yet they gave him a standing ovation? I don't know why, because this wasn't funny. It also wasn't original at all.If you're looking for 'jokes' about not trusting doctors, how kids should still be beaten with belts and how much his wife talks then this is for you. How about how bad video games are and how soft kids are these days? Those old, unoriginal, uninteresting and unfunny staples are all here. It's like a time machine!This was honestly one of the worst sets of 'comedy' I've ever seen. It also surprised me, because I thought Kevin James was better than this. Well, more original and less of an old curmudgeon from the 80s.",True
12,2,Not my cup of tea.,thepeculiarpalette,n/a,15/08/2025,"I will preface this by saying I'm not a huge fan of stand up. I like some of them but others I feel are trying way too hard. Like this one. I liked KOQ and when I saw Kevin had a special I decided to give it a whirl. When he was coming out and started rolling around on the floor I had a feeling this wasn't going to end well. It's just not very funny. I also think it's way too athletic with all the jumping around and frantically gesturing while making annoying sound effects. I'm sure plenty of people enjoy that kind of humor, but I guess I'm not one of them. He really lost me when he started talking about ripping the faces off of wild animals and eating it. I personally would much rather hear f-bombs than stuff like that. Yesterday I watched Gary Gulman's new special on Max and thought it was really funny so I'm not completely dead inside and do have a sense of humor. Just not for this.",False
13,1,Unfunny and tired material,Sansreality,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a disappointment. Pregnant pauses intermixed with attempts at physical comedy. Brutally unfunny, but at least halfway through I got a solid nap. There is so much dead air waiting for punchlines that never come. This special is not a rehash of his TV or movie comedy but a lame attempt at familial humor. It's utterly boring and not worth your time. Maybe the microphone was ill placed but there was more time spent watching him wipe his sweating brow and listening to his heavy breathing than laughing. Hope Kevin goes back to the lab and retools before attempting another special. I didn't expect much and was delivered less.",False
14,1,To call this Comedy is a stretch,daelendd,n/a,15/08/2025,"You'd be forgiven if you didn't know that Kevin James started his career as a stand up before transitioning into a sitcom actor then an awful movie 'star'.This felt more like an attempt to extend into stand up by a youtuber than a set by a seasoned pro.Decided to give it a try given his youtube videos had some entertainment value, but this was absolutely awful. Didn't have a memorable joke at all, and was basically just the old man waving at cloud meme stretched into a 1 hour set that was 1 hour too long.Easily the worse special of 2024 so far and i'd find it hard to think anything could eclipse it.",False
15,10,Funny Clean Honest Good Hearted Humor,creativegoddess,n/a,15/08/2025,"I personally loved his honest humor and witty analogies. If you're 40s+ I think you will understand and enjoy this a lot. If you've grown up in the ""everyone deserves a trophy"" generation, you can say ""I'm good"" for this one, it's ok! Might be best to not attempt to understand. I clapped and hooted at least 4 times because it was so true and relatable to what we personally experienced. I also laughed so hard when he was talking about his wife not having filtered thoughts. I love that the 40+ can laugh at our idiosyncrasies & not get offended! Life is too short for that. I would call this a No-hitter! Glad you kept just throwing KJ!!",False
16,1,Kevin has grown out of touch,dscl08,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've always been a huge Kevin James fan, but it seems he's lost touch with where we are today. His jokes in this special were old rehashed ""back in the good ol days"" schlock. Kids play too much video games, we don't beat kids enough, blah blah blah. Sounded like the boomer generation talk instead of the down to earth style he used to have. The very first joke was good and funny if not a little derivative, but had he stuck with that kind of tone the special would've been watchable. All downhill after that, couldn't even bring myself to watch the last twenty minutes. I will miss the Kevin James of old.",False
17,2,"Not what I was expecting, unfortunately",natearchibald-955-348650,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have watched all of his comedy specials and was so let down by this one. He went from jokes about popcorn kernels getting welded to the back of your throat, Sweat the small stuff is a must watch special, to jokes we have heard from every other comedian. He would wait for an audience reaction and there wouldn't be one and it seemed to throw him off. On previous specials his jokes and storeis seem to flow, this one seemed forced. I lost interest about 20min in and turned it off. I was born in 1980 and understood drinking from the hose, fearing the belt but his presentation and even agree with some of his statements. It just doesn't compare to the past stand up shows.",False
18,2,Not funny :/,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,n/a,15/08/2025,"Kevin James IS funny! He is. I mean, KOQ, Paul Blart (the first one) and other movies, he can be very funny. He's got it in him. But this standup thing? Nah, it's not for him.His jokes/schtick just isn't funny on a stage. The jokes don't land and some of them go on waaaaayyyyy toooooooo looooonnngggg. Like the deer joke. I already knew what it was going to be when I saw the audience that he was about to do his act for. That told me all I needed to know but I still watched anyway because I thought it would still have some good stuff in there. Nope. Didn't happen.It was like watching a live action version of Kevin Can Wait. Un-funny and forced. Kevin, give this up, put your wig and shorts back on and give us another season or two of KOQ. Doug Half-A-Man is your lane. Not standup. Please don't do anymore standup. Don't standup but instead, sit down.",False
19,2,Was this meant to be funny?,osborntyler,n/a,15/08/2025,"I went into this wanting it to be good and really giving it more opportunity than it deserved. I've enjoyed some of Kevin's work through the years and some of it has been less than inspiring. This falls under the latter. Listening to him rant and complain about things that he clearly doesn't understand was what really killed it for me. If you have any medical knowledge you'll find this absolutely unbearable to sit through. Then the lazy jokes about his wife talking too much, just left me pitying his wife rather than producing any laughs. I strongly recommend you do not watch this comedy special. I feel like it would be one thing if this special was simply unfunny, but it was worse than that. It made me lose respect for Kevin James.",False
20,10,Comedy Gold,ajjeterlover-86572,n/a,15/08/2025,"Don't listen to the bad reviews because this is comedy gold. This world has grown so freaking soft that they get so offended by jokes. It was so relatable and had me dying laughing pretty much the whole time.I'm seeing reviews saying ""old man yells at cloud"" when that's literally what you're doing getting so bent out of shape about a stand-up comedy special. Kevin James is one of the funniest comedians of all time and this was some of his best work.For all you people that don't find this funny and all butthurt about these jokes, go listen to the most unfunny ""comedian"" ever in Amy Schumer. And no, it's not cause she's a woman. Man, woman, or alien she's not funny.",False
21,1,I didn't laugh one time.,wtoolen,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am amazed how this mess passes for comedy. I liked ""King of Queens"" too, and i have nothing against Mr. James, but this was just plain awful. The ""jokes"" go nowhere, and they drag on forever. This guy is just not funny, and there is no excuse for it. He has been around a long time. He should have hired a joke writer and a coach, but it seems he's just resting on his laurels. The people in the live audience seemed to think every word was hilarious though. I guess his fans would like anything he does. I am more objective. I judge each movie and performance on its merit, not whether or not i am a fan of the person doing it. Most people are the opposite. They are binary-minded. We see this same effect in politics. People decide to back a certain politician, and WHATEVER that politician does, they AUTOMATICALLY support.",False
22,1,Did this come out in 1984 or 2024?,shadowrunnervii,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerKevin James seems to be joining the ranks of old Gen-X comics ranting about the ""good ol' days"", a la recent Chris Rock, Jo Koy, Dave Chapelle, where we beat our kids, just expected them to know how to be adults, and dunked on our spouses. There was nothing special about this special - it was a throwback of the worst kind. Rants about participation trophies, not physically punishing our children, how things were so much better in the 1970's, and his how his wife ""talks too much"". Unfunny, unenlightened, and a huge miss for a comic who has been topical and funny over the years. Please, see yourself out and let some fresh talent take over.",True
23,3,Anyone who asks me,jpapanone,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hey...I see Kevin James has a new special. Have you seen it... should I check it out.Uhh..I did, so you don't have to.I love the King of Queens.I have listened/watched his ""Sweat the Small Stuff"" comedy Central special 10 times...maybe more.Love some of his bits and material from that...even the ones that were better stand up material than lines he forces into episodes of KOQ.He has probably 12 or so solid premises, bits, lines in that special.This ..
My goodness gracious.This is rough.Material and execution, both very very poor.I think I smiled or silently chuckled or thought he made a good point maybe 3 or 4 times.He came out dancing and moving for about a minute. Absolutely unnecessary.I have this a 3.Def not 10 9 8 7 6 5.It was sub 5...so, I generously gave it a 3.If this wasn't Kevin James...and I didn't already like him, but was a brand new guy. I'd be like...ok. Never need to see that guy again.Do I like Kevin James? Yes.Will I see his newer stuff? Eh. Maybe. Depends on what it is...depends the time commitment required.My expectations? Well...I've seen his stuff the last 10 years, so it ain't a positive expectation.",False
24,1,Therapy is needed!,jnkfe,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI used to love this guy. It starts of strong, great music, good/funny dancing, and some actual funny jokes. But after hearing him rant for an hour about how you should abuse your children with an actual belt like the good old days, he really lost me as a fan. You would think after getting like five pitty claps from the audience he would move on to different material. But no. He goes further and basically sums himself up as the worst father in the world. ""My kid sat down...I was furious."" Dude, then maybe you don't need kids. He needs therapy. His kids need therapy because of him. And I could win big on a bet that they do not have a close relationship as those kids get older.",True

1,7,Antidote to NETLFIX's Pirate Kingdom,erdogankale,n/a,17/08/2025,"National Geographic's ""Pirates: Behind the Legends"" is a commendable foray into the swashbuckling world of piracy, offering a refreshing take on the real history behind the legendary figures of the high seas. Unlike Netflix's ""Pirate Kingdom,"" this documentary strives to delve deep into historical accuracy, successfully bridging the gap between scholarly research and general audience engagement. It manages to be both informative and entertaining, capturing the attention of viewers with its rich storytelling and meticulous detail.One of the series' notable strengths is its dedication to thoroughness. Each episode focuses on a single pirate, with a runtime of 45 minutes. This detailed approach is a stark contrast to other documentaries that often try to cover the entire scope of piracy in just one hour. This extended focus allows for a richer exploration of each figure, presenting a well-rounded portrayal that includes their exploits, motivations, and the socio-political context of their times.The experts featured in the documentary are another highlight. National Geographic has chosen real experts from relevant fields, who provide valuable insights and are given ample space to elaborate on significant issues. Particularly impressive are Richard Blakemore and Mark G. Hanna, whose contributions add substantial depth to the narrative. Their interviews are among the most enlightening parts of the series, offering perspectives that elevate the overall quality of the documentary.However, the series is not without its drawbacks. Despite its efforts at historical accuracy, much of the information presented will already be familiar to those well-versed in pirate history. About 70-80% of the content may not be new to piracy enthusiasts. Additionally, the selection of experts is predominantly UK/US-based, which is a recurring issue in pirate documentaries. This focus results in a somewhat narrow perspective, omitting valuable insights from scholars in Spain, France, Holland, Turkey, and North African countries. The episodes on Drake, Morgan, and Ward, in particular, would have greatly benefited from the inclusion of Spanish and Muslim scholars to provide a more balanced viewpoint.Visually, the series excels in some areas while falling short in others. The maps, tables, and explanatory materials are top-notch, aiding in the viewer's understanding of complex historical contexts such as ship types and sea routes. The historical reenactments, while decent, suffer from a repetitive nature and a grey, washed-out visual style reminiscent of ""Game of Thrones"" or ""Vikings."" This stylistic choice detracts from the vibrant settings of the Caribbean, Mediterranean, and Africa, where more vivid colors would have been more appropriate.The selection of pirates covered in the series is a mixed bag. While the episode on John Ward stands out as the best, introducing viewers to a lesser-known yet fascinating figure, the producers missed an opportunity to spotlight other intriguing pirates. The focus on well-trodden figures like Blackbeard, Kidd, and Anne Bonny feels redundant. More daring choices, such as Henry Every or William Dampier, would have added fresh perspectives and increased the series' appeal.In conclusion, ""Pirates: Behind the Legends"" is a solid addition to the genre, offering a detailed and engaging look at some of history's most notorious pirates. Its commitment to historical accuracy and the inclusion of expert insights make it a valuable watch. However, its over-reliance on familiar narratives and a limited range of scholarly perspectives slightly diminishes its impact. Despite these flaws, the series is a must-watch for anyone interested in the golden age of piracy, providing enough new material and expert commentary to keep even seasoned enthusiasts engaged.",False
2,9,If you loved Black Sails Don't Miss This!,roy-95830,n/a,17/08/2025,"The true stories behind the pirates. Excellent maps and animations show routes sailed and explain story progression. The recreated characters involved and dramatic scenes are done well without being over acted or too lengthy.I would have liked to have seen Anna O'Malley play Queen Elizabeth, since she produced the show there would have been irony and perhaps even poignancy in the second episode about Grace O'Malley.The show gives us insights and stories that give us helpful context. Why was piracy so successful and better still why we retain such romantic positivity about them.Many were murderous psychopaths and they built no schools. But they did prove that leadership can be kind and successful. They broke up monopolies and broke down barriers to success. Black pirates were equal and treated as such, although they had no qualms about selling slaves. Fascinating.Well done!",False

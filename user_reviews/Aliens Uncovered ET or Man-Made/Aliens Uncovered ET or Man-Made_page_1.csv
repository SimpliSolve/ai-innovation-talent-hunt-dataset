1,2,C'mon now. Seriously?,remmyhargrove,n/a,15/08/2025,"The best movies ever made in the world, of all time, don't even get a bunch of 10-star reviews. If that doesn't spell out scam to everyone, I don't know what else would. Aliens Uncovered is not a 10 by anyone's standard. I feel generous dropping a two! This isn't an angry guy trolling independent movies; it is someone being honest. I DON'T EVEN WRITE REVIEWS OFTEN AND FELT LIKE I HAD TO AFTER SEEING A BUNCH OF 10 OUT OF 10S! Clearly, these reviews are from the filmmaker's family and friends because nobody would give this a 10. I only gave it a 2 in case the movie gets better. I only watched it for 15-20 minutes. I admit it. So maybe it gets better, but I doubt it. Be warned. Even if you LOVE documentaries, this looks stitched together by a kid in high school using Windows Movie Maker.",False
2,2,Not for me.,daviontruth,n/a,15/08/2025,"I generally enjoy docs like this as I am a firm believer. But I didn't get far here. The reviews I see must be from friends because they do not describe this movie at all. Things start off alright, but it becomes clear very quickly that this film is not that good. Never mind the janky editing and the very strange visuals. There are effects and transitions and overlays that just look really bad. Sorry. You can tell within a few minutes this film was not put together by industry professionals. Which, by the way, is not the issue in itself. I love micro-budget movies. This just doesn't work. It's hard to explain but it is hard to take this film seriously when it is put together the way it is.",False
3,1,And the biggest mystery is...,dannyboyflorisk,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler... how this has such a high rating? This ""movie"" is a perfect example of what happens when a preschooler gets their hands on a video editor and goes to town. I couldn't watch too much of it. I don't know a lot about movies, but I just couldn't get far into this at all. It's like it takes itself so seriously but doesn't look the part. Like a 99-year-old little old lady who is threatening to come over there and bring you the pain. I'm sure someone likes it, but not me. I also don't believe all these people gave it a 10. That kills any credibility right there. Aliens Uncovered: ET or Man-made's biggest mystery is whether it was actually made by an alien.",True
4,10,UFO's are a hot topic and this is it!!!,LJonesIII,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a gritty as they come but worth the watch. Very low budget but the story is compelling and gets you from the start and its exit lets your know theres more to come. I was pleased with seeing the footage that looked authentic. I watched on the Roku Channel so it didnt cost, overall I will give this film an honest 8 but a full 10 on this site.Looking forward to the following film and hoping it answers some of the questions that are left on the table. I will also attempt to use some of the methods provided in this documentary on how to look at the sky. If you have an hour and a half to burn and your a fan of the subject, you should definitely give this one a watch.",False
5,10,Everything you see isn't what it appears to be,anicamiller-12262,n/a,15/08/2025,I've lived in Arizona my entire life and I've never even heard about these things happening. The real life images were unbelievable and the break down of events was awesome. I definitely recommend watching!,False

7,10,Awesome!,vjeanrogers,n/a,15/08/2025,Very well done. I recommend it highly. Clive's evidence is something to really make you question what we have been told all of these years. I am so proud to be a friend and a believer. Congrats and continued success!,False
8,10,A different type of UFO documentary,TopherByfield,n/a,15/08/2025,What a ride! Actually watching this for the first time in its entirety and I cannot believe what was accomplished. Thank you to all the fans and supporters of this documentary and I will continue to bring you more!,False
9,10,Finally the sighting in Arizona are being talked about,axeman1989,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nevada and New Mexico always gets the attention, it's a pleasure seeing a film that focuses on the UFO sightings happening in other locations looking forward to the next one.",False
10,10,Must watch!,sjohnsonjohnson,n/a,15/08/2025,You can feel and see Clive Christopher's passion In one of the best Documentation and educational documentaries available to the general public on the UAP subject. It'll make a believer out of you. It's time to get on the right side of the tracks on the subject. The content and videos are all high quality and he explains the breakdown of the difference between man made objects and other objects that we just can't explain away with conventional means. I am so looking forward to the next installment because I already know that the quality and passion is there. Thanks again to Clive and his team for their passion!,False
11,10,AMAZED!!,bernablubookings,n/a,15/08/2025,This movie was cleverly done! Had so much detail and information. Definitely kept my attention. Very interesting. I was able to learn a lot and was highly entertained. What a GREAT AMAZING production. I purchased this movie and suggest you do the same. This was by far my favorite Documentary on UFO's. If you live in AZ this is a MUST SEE. Be informed. Watch this movie!I hope to see others take the lead of this documentary and help us learn more about what is really going on out their in the sky.The producer of this movie is obviously a risk taker and I appreciate someone stepping out and bringing awareness!,False
12,10,Absolutely amazing,aaronrenfro,n/a,15/08/2025,This is a must watch. I haven't seen a documentary quite as interesting and informative as this one. It really keeps you on the edge and has you questioning what really happened in New Mexico.,False
13,10,"This was just amazing, captivating.",misundupris,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this one. I was just sitting here eating curly fries and saw the cover photo for the film. I was already hooked. All I can say is; Wow Mr. Clive, my hats off to you. Great storytelling I'm really happy I decided to watching this one. On my way to watch it one more time lol.",False
14,10,Incredible Documentary,jasonbrear,n/a,15/08/2025,"I just watched your documentary, And I must say it's one of the most well explained documented films I've seen in a long time. I really appreciate people like you who actually put time into investigating the truth. There's so much fake crap and misinformation out there that it's hard to believe what is actually going on. Anyways keep doing what your doing and I hope to see more in the future.",False
15,10,Great Doc,djuknowwho,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fun to watch, very well made/put together. I grew up in Phoenix, always hearing about UFOs and I have always been into them. Finally there is a film made just for me.",False
16,10,Watch Out!! Someone is doing their research.,CarlHamid,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNow, I have a better understanding on UAP's and why the nomenclature is being used more frequently. Not really sure about the spotting techniques given in this film but I will surely try and see if they are effective.Great Job.",True
17,10,A MUST WATCH!!,dhenchcliffe,n/a,15/08/2025,"By far the best documentary in years!! I found it so refreshing to see so much ""new"" material! Not just that but it was educational...in a FUN understanding way. As Neuro divergent person sometimes I zone out with certain types of movies...this kept me engaged 100% of the time. I didn't want it to end. Clive re inspired me to do more!! To learn more...to look MORE! Please if you have ever seen ""something"" in the sky and are just curious WATCH THIS! And if you consider yourself an expert WATCH THIS BECAUSE you are missing out on an amazing fellow UFO ology enthusiast!Please if you do anything rent this documentary because everyone needs to see it! I wished I bought it!! I will be ASAP!!",False
18,8,Enjoyable and in depth. Geared to believers.,William_Conrad_x34,n/a,15/08/2025,"I came across this while watching the B Stream and finally got the time to take a look. Now, usually I'm more for the quicker 45-50 minute docs like this, but I managed to stick around for this in one viewing. That instantly makes this film a good one in my books. Ultimately, this is a doc about aliens (obviously) geared to believers. AU doesn't contain much (any) back and forth between believers and non-believers, and assumes the person watching it already believes. This was really my only complaint because I like to hear things from both sides. Do I believe? Yes. Do I believe we humans have been visited? Well, I'm still on the fence about that. But AU is a pretty detailed documentary, and frankly, it is better than a lot of what is out there right now. Is it the best? No. Is it the worst? Not even close. For those already on the believer side of the scale, you'll find a lot to enjoy here.",False

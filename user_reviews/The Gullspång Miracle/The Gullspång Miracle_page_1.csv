1,8,An odd story about family,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat a strange story this is! Two sisters bump into the body double of their other sister, long dead by her own hand. The stranger turns out to be the deceased's hitherto unbenknown twin, smuggled away at birth to hide her from the Nazis (who liked to experiment on twins). The twin then investigates her sister's death, and discovers it might well have been from natural causes. Then she falls out with her living siblings. Then she starts to suspect her twin's death was actually murder. Finally, a new set of DNA tests challenges the claim (supported by previous tests) were related at all. It seems that the film-maker started to film when many of the later twists of plot had not yet happened. It might have been more satisfying if it reached a final answer - instead, the mysteries remain unsovled. It's still an intriguing story, and one that makes us think about how family makes us what we are.",True
2,8,A True-Crime Fever Dream Wrapped in Existential Mystery,juliehnor,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSpoiler Alert:
This review discusses plot developments and themes revealed throughout The Gullspång Miracle. If you prefer to go in blind - as the film invites - consider watching before reading on.The Gullspång Miracle is a documentary that starts with a divine coincidence and ends somewhere between a psychological thriller, a metaphysical puzzle, and a deadpan Scandinavian farce. What begins as a heartwarming tale of two devout Norwegian sisters believing they've found their long-lost sibling quickly unravels into something far stranger, darker - and brilliantly elusive.Director Maria Fredriksson refuses to give the viewer any comforting resolution. Every time we think we're getting closer to ""the truth,"" the ground shifts beneath us. The documentary raises as many questions as it answers: Was Astrid's death really a suicide? Who exactly is Olaug - the woman who might be their sister, or a stranger caught in a delusion not her own? And by the end, even Fredriksson herself is drawn into the spiral.One of the most brilliant (and disorienting) moments comes during the closing credits, where Olaug leaves a voicemail suggesting that perhaps she and the director should take a DNA test - maybe they're related too. It's unsettling, darkly funny, and emblematic of the film's core: the desire for meaning in a world that offers only fragments.What elevates this documentary is its cinematic craft - carefully composed shots, slow-burning tension, and a tone that balances reverence with absurdity. The film is never cruel toward its participants, but it also doesn't shield them from the viewer's gaze. And that tension - between empathy and observation - is exactly where the film gets its power.If you're looking for clear answers, this isn't your film. But if you're fascinated by the ways faith, trauma, memory, and identity collide - and how the search for truth can swallow everyone involved - then The Gullspång Miracle is a quietly staggering experience.",True
3,7,A Story That Needs a Deeper Dive,gerard_jan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Gullspång Miracle is a captivating documentary that begins with a family's mysterious experience but soon unravels into much more - possible corporate injustice, family trauma, and questions about a sister's death that remain unanswered. While Fredriksson presents an intimate and thoughtful portrayal of the family's beliefs, she ultimately leaves too many crucial questions unresolved.The film touches on contradictory DNA results, potential wrongful dismissal from a job, and a death that may involve foul play - yet there is no real follow-through. The documentary raises significant issues but stops short of pushing for real answers.This is where The Gullspång Miracle falls short: art should not just reveal mystery; it must also hold space for truth. The open-ended nature of the film risks sensationalizing a serious issue without offering closure or justice.A follow-up documentary or investigation is desperately needed to dive deeper into these unresolved threads. Only then can the true weight of this story be understood.",True
4,9,Miracles and Lies,david_jinkins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Someone is lying. Or maybe everyone is. The Gullspång Miracle, a documentary, begins with an incredible story, and keeps delivering twists and turns, even after the credits start. I give the filmmaker Maria Frederiksson credit for not trying to manipulate the odd-shaped facts which are uncovered to fit a clear narrative. The audience, like Frederiksson, never finds out exactly who is trustworthy and who is hiding something. But everyone cannot be telling us the whole truth.This is documentary film making at its finest. The cinematography, editing, and especially the score work together to make each twist hit hard. Each person in the film understands the world in their own way, and none of their stories are consistent with all of the facts. Each of them must decide what they believe about the past and who they really are. They must also decide what they tell the others. And what they don't.In addition to its craft, it is refreshing to watch a film primarily featuring people older than sixty, and mostly women. This may be the only film I have ever seen that fails the reverse Bechdel test. Two men never once speak to each other in the film.This first-class documentary deserves far more acclaim than it has won already. It is a tragedy it is not yet on wider release, or streaming anywhere. If it is playing near you, don't miss seeing it while you can.",False
5,10,"Masterful, unbelievable mix of genres",martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis stellar documentary is unlike most you will have seen, by a great director nontheless, whom I actually had the pleasure to meet for the film's premiere.It is a very far fetched, unbelievable and ever evolving web of twists and turns that is somehow true - and it is all tremendously well put together. The cutting and editing is top notch, to say the least. Despite it being a documentary, it goes far beyond that - and even invokes a sense of being a drama, or a dark comedy, akin to those of, for say, the Cohen brothers.All around, ever exciting, engaging and very beautifully put together. You definitely have to give this crazy and unbeliavably true documentary a watch. Something like this has perhaps only been done by Herzog in the past.The Swedish Fargo is a documentary! Highly recommended.",True
6,9,The mystery continues,yoyoraso,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great movie if you like mystery movies with documentary vibes. The director did a great work with the material she had, also working with normal people has no experience and getting this final result tells you everything about the amazing work done by the director and how much effort. The movie will always make you wonder and question everything specially when it starts to play with you back and forward. I was lucky to watch the movie and have a Q&A with the director after. I think this movie can continue with a follow up in the future which the director said it is always a possibility, also she added that there are some future projects will build on this story but adding some fiction which I think will be interesting to see. Finally she mentioned that movie took 5 years of working which is wow.",False
7,3,Annoying,boris-110,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWithout asking questions this type of documentary filmmaking is just voyeurism.There are so many unanswered questions throughout this documentary. Towards the end the makers stop the action to interject that, they are upset because someone is lying, - I found myself shouting - Where were you at the beginning when there were glaring questions that needed asking ? - even when they interject to say this they never pursue it because it exposes the documentary itself.It seems to me that the makers started making a film about these quirky characters and their ""miracle"". It then became a much more complex story and at some point they realised they'd been duped but they'd already spent a great deal of time and money so they carried on and decided to just let the subjects give us confusing information and not pursue it in any depth.It became all about getting the film safely over the finish line and not about answering any questions.I find this very selfish film making - you exploit your subjects and you exploit your viewers.",True
8,9,One of the best documentaries I've seen in years,glenysgjohnson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brilliant documentary. Fascinating tale. Beautifully shot. I feel so lucky to have stumbled across this via BBC storyville. It definitely makes me want to make a documentary of my own. Not sure what the other guy who left a review is on about. The story is strong and the director does a great job of following the organic twists and turns that come up. Ticks all the boxes for what a great documentary should be. Does a great job have handling family drama in an appropriate way. Definitely worth a watch if you can get it. Well done to everyone involved in this film, you should be very proud of yourselves.",False
9,9,Riveting,nde-78595,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerStumbled across this via Storyville on BBC. Absolutely bizarre and compulsive to watch and I felt like my mind had been well and truly bent by the end. The way the filmmaker had gone about their job was stylish and skillful, keeping me hanging on every word. Does anyone know what the hell was going on? I was expecting a big reveal that Olaug faked her own death and took the insurance money. What was going on with the blood tests? Why didn't the police follow up on the dodgy death thing? Or was the whole thing just fiction?I suspect the latter.In any case this is well worth an hour and a half of your time.",True
10,2,A documentary going nowhere,PaddyBlake,n/a,16/08/2025,"I see how this happened.A surprising coincidence sparks an idea for a doco, that will slowly reveal itself. Except it doesn't, because really nothing much happens here.I have worked on BBC documentaries that have been dropped because you realise the story simply doesn't warrant continuing. I thing the director's increasingly shrill interjections in the latter parts suggest that they are aware of this also.When I think of how high the bar is set by Storyville with work like 'The Gatekeepers', 'Navalny', 'Raising a School Shooter' and 'I Will Be Murdered', I am astonished this was screened in the Storyville slot, if you miss the last 20 minutes, don't worry, nothing happens.",False
11,3,Don't waste your time,teodor-nilson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pointless story told in an overly dramatic way by a filmmaker who can't handle when their project takes a disappointing turn. It feels like the cast are used as puppets and in the end nothing gets resolved. Don't waste your time watching this. There's no mystery in the filmmaking, only cheap tricks to build some suspense to keep you watching. But it never gets truly interesting because the story lacks substance. It only exists in the head of the main characters and the filmmaker. The problem of this documentary is that it's constructed in a way that emphasises excitement of the story when there is none. Why not slow down and let people interact on their own?",False
12,4,More questions than answers,jordverburg,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have no idea whether to give this 2 or 9 stars. To be honest, it was quite boring. And even when it felt like a dreading documentary, the documentary maker (Maria) still rushed a lot of topics. Genius if it's a mockumentary, sloppy if it's is a documentary.******** major spoiler alert. *******************************************
I have a few questions.1. Isn't this a mockumentary?It could very well be to mess with our heads. Counterargument would be that everyone would have been a great actor. Maria is a genius if it is. But if it isn't a mockumentary, it gets weirder.2. I'm not a historian, but I found out that the twin-experiments in Auschwitz by Josef Mengele started later. Mengele stayed in Auschwitz from May 1943 until Januari 1945. That would contradict separating twins in 1941.3. Was Olaug the other twin? Everyone was pretty convinced until Olaug found out she hated her new family. It would be a little weird for identical twins to grow up close to each other in the same small town and no one found out.4. If Olaug wasn't part of the family, where does she come from?5. Were the three life insurances paid out? And to whom? Why does no one seems to be researching things like this?6. Even do-it-yourself DNA-tests are reliable. How could the second one be different? Was the first one even done?In interviews Olaug said she has never seen the first test. Kari and the others said they couldn't find the result of the first test. Why would Maria start this documentary based on a false test by a nephew?7. Does no one compare photographs of Lita and Olaug when they were the same age? We don't see a lot of this. Did they really look alike?8. I really didn't get the deal with the still life and the holy trinity. It seems important but also really not.9. Why would the police give all sorts of information about what appears to be a cold case?10. Why would Maria end the documentary without researching the possible murder?11. Why would Olaug call Maria to do a DNA-test at the end of the movie?Was she angry at Maria for dragging her into this? Or was Olaug a little crazy?",True
13,1,There is no story here,peter-beaves,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat started as a potentially fascinating story collapsed into just displaying the stupidity of everyone involved. The filmmaker had to use every trick in the book to keep me watching - and I fell for all of them. Religious people cannot face the real world without invoking the interference of their god in everything that affects them. I already knew that so why the hell did I watch this non-story? I must be stupid too! There are so many points in the story that simply do not make sense and yet we don't see any real attempt at resolution. For example, there are two conflicting sets of DNA tests done but no attempt is made to find out why they are completely different. It's almost as if the filmmaker has inserted one of them to contradict the other to keep the 'story' going. There are other examples which you will see if you can be bothered to watch it but I've spent too much time on it already to go into any more detail.",True
14,4,A strange beast indeed,johmil-18374,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is hard to understand what the hype of this documentary is about. I seen plenty of these kind of documentaries when the basic theme simple dissolve in front of the camera since reality do not follow a script.But the strange part is the good reviews and even prizes that this documentary got. It has a basic red thread and when that falls flat the documentary kind of tries out ten more possible stories. None of them works.After reading some reviews it seems that some came to the conclusion that at least some of the people in the documentary has to lie. That is not my take on it. I see it as just a lot of loose threads, and no one can say anyting about them.But for me the filmmaker seems to want to make a better story out of something that was probably nothing in the end.I do not know if the documentary director wanted to bring herself into the documentary because she gets angry when things do not go the way she want it, and surprisingly she films her saying that too and question the people in the documentary.It could be that she knowingly brings in the angle that she is the filmmaker and she do not know what to do when the story falls apart. Then she tries all angles to keep the documentary alive. But I do not think the story is such a meta story even though that would be interesting at least.",False
15,3,Preposterous waste of time!,backofthevan,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the first scene with the director demanding that her subjects ""perform"" in a certain way rather than just tell the story as it happened to them, alarm bells went off for me.I was initially intrigued by the promise of some kind of miracle happening, an almost unbelievably serendipitous meeting of long-lost family... Sounded amazing until it wasn't.So many questions arose that were not only never answered, the answers were never pursued! Questions arose, floated in the air, then left to drop with no explanation.Some reviews claim this is a brilliant documentary... Maybe they watched a different version where intelligent people encountered an intriguing mystery, pursued answers and brought it all to a satisfying, fully explained conclusion. But that was not what happened in this pile of confusion and frustration.An utter waste of time.",False
16,n/a,No miracle here...,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"...just more reasonably gullible, possibly ignorant, most likely disingenuous and sadly perhaps even desperate zealots with their minds clouded by their own conviction, attempting to fabricate a narrative around disconnected details - not even haphazardly found as depicted but obviously specifically dug after and selected for the prime purpose ""documentaries"" alike pursue - and then laboriously trying to fit them into the presupposed mould carved out by wishful thinking of the director with the intent to flog off a story for individuals proned to religious woo.Very disheartening to come to realize such sensationalism riding ghost stories are still produced as if were they valid by any rational standards thus remotely anchored in a shared reality. And heartrending is they have a market.",False
17,5,Gullspång miracle,gurumaggie,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWow where doing start, two religious sisters look at a flat and the owner looks like their dead sister.They take DNA tests bingo they are sisters, end of story but wait there's more, it turns out the sister may have been hidden from the Nazis because she's a twin, her birth and baptism certificates make her five years younger.The dead sister supposedly committed suicide or did she?This is an absolute rollercoaster of a ride, the director comes across as a bit annoying putting words in people's mouths and yelling you told me you had a story, which I found strangeThe family fall out because the new sister is overlooked by the happy clappers and they try to make over in their image of the dead sister.There are many more twists and turns I recommend this documentary highly.",True

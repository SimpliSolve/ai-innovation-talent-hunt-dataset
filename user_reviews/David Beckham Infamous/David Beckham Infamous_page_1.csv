1,2,Bad bad documentary,kouts-48386,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWe have here one of the most recognised player in the world, and you just make this film, by doing what? Wrapping up videos from tv? Bad montage, the film goes back and forward in time , without reason, making hard to follow the damn story.A waste of 1 hour watching.",True
2,1,Style over substance,byronfelson,n/a,15/08/2025,"Why anyone would want to waste their time and money reviewing the life and career of one of the most overrated footballers in the world is beyond me.Average footballer, married a less than average 'pop star', now spends his retirement hob'nobbing with his, mostly, more talented and more famous friends while obsessively trying to promote his children's lives on social media.Nothing but a 'look at me' advertisement.",False
3,7,Surprisingly........ok,sjcolwell-39427,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNever been a fan of DB (or footie) but found this quite interesting and did not expect to. For all the wealth etc etc he has made some dodgy decisions and ended up having some seriously dark periods in his life. His father was a hard taskmaster and the usual 'London based Man U fan' that in itself was telling, and being a fan of the family dynamic, was Pa living his dreams through his son who seemed terrified to let him down? You decide. PR op or not DB came across as quite a grafter in the football world ......I know......oxymoron :) and despite being seen as a 'pretty boy' was very stubborn. Could not help laughing when DB told his wife that she used be more common...brownie points...gone!",True

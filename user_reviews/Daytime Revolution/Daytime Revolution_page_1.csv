1,7,TV Magic,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Is it nostalgia? Is it history? Is it activism? Is it entertainment? This documentary from Erik Nelson is all of the above and more. It's an incredible treat for viewers as well as providing a snapshot in time of a week that influenced changes in daytime television talk shows. In 1972, the host of the most popular daytime TV show invited John Lennon and Yoko Ono to co-host ""The Michael Douglas Show"". Was it a clash of cultures? Yes it was. Was it TV magic? Absolutely.Let's be real ... this was quite a risk for the time. Mike Douglas was a popular host because his daytime show was relatively benign and moderately entertaining for those watching television during the day. To invite John and Yoko, the 'radicals' accused not only of breaking up The Beatles, but also for being quite extreme in their counterculture thoughts and actions, was a courageous act and one that risked turning off a substantial portion of the audience. And this wasn't just one show on one day. Douglas went all in - John and Yoko were to co-host a full week ... five shows where they selected the guests.Director Nelson wisely divided the documentary into segments of the five shows in order so that we can follow along. Show number one aired February 14, 1972 - a fitting date since John and Yoko stated they were looking to spread love and peace with their message. The first show featured some honest admissions from Lennon, as well as an in-depth interview with Ralph Nader. Just 38 at the time, the uber-intelligent Nader was viewed as an alarmist and extremist, though much of what he preached has since come true. Ninety-year-old Nader appears in the documentary recollecting his appearance and proving that he remains engaged and sharp even today.The second show included folk singer Nobuko Miyomoto and activist and anti-war demonstrator Jerry Rubin. It's fascinating to see Mike Douglas have a discussion with Rubin, and obviously Lennon and Yoko shared many of the same beliefs as Rubin, who comes across as a passionate, level-headed spokesperson. The third show is a musical highlight as John Lennon meets (for the first time) one of the rock pioneers he idolized, Chuck Berry. The two legends shared the stage to perform ""Memphis, Tennessee"". We hear them harmonize, watch Chuck Berry do his duck walk, and are subjected to Yoko screeching into the microphone. Two other guests on the show were Macrobiotic diet chef Hilary Nedleaf and David Rosenbloom, the latter whom demonstrated his biofeedback music utilizing brainwaves. Both are also interviewed today about their appearance on the show. Singer and Broadway performer Vivian Reed performs on the fourth show while modern day Vivian Reed giddily watches the clip of herself. Black Panthers leader Bobby Seale discusses the charity programs he's involved with and still manages to get his beliefs on the record. It's on this show where John Lennon performs his classic, ""Imagine"".The fifth and final show has George Carlin as a guest, as well as a doctor lamenting the importance of reducing one's blood pressure. It's probably the most disappointing segment since we get very little of young Carlin and his quick wit. TV Producer E. V. Di Massi provides periodic commentary, and Yoko instills a bit of her performance art in the use of a broken cup that slowly gets reassembled as the week progresses. It's a bit surprising to learn that Roger Ailes, who later became CEO of Fox News had been a producer on ""The Mike Douglas Show"", but mostly we are amazed that given the times (Nixon, etc) that a popular network show allowed Lennon (only age 31 at the time) so much freedom to spread the message of the 'movement'. And if you are wondering, the week provided terrific ratings. For those paying attention, the similarities between then and now are quite clear.Opening in select theaters on October 9 (John Lennon's birthday)",False
2,7,interesting slice of time,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"After the breakup of The Beatles, John Lennon and Yoko Ono move to New York City and embed themselves in the far left politics. They find a sympathetic ear in the popular daytime talk show, The Mike Douglas Show. In 1972, they are given a week of programming to present the movement to middle American housewives. Mike Douglas interviews and introduces the couple to his audience. Roger Ailes is a surprising name in this. There is a lot of footage from the show. I don't care that much about most of it except for some performances. John Lennon does Imagine and also sings with Chuck Berry. That is two legends colliding. There are some interesting behind-the-scene stories. This is an interesting slice of an era seen through a difference lens.",False
3,7,John Lennon and Ralph Nader,MortSahlFan,n/a,16/08/2025,"John Lennon and Ralph Nader (who has been right all along) - two figures long held up as voices of truth and conscience. But time has a way of revealing cracks in even the most celebrated ideals. History hasn't been kind to some of their beliefs, and this film doesn't shy away from showing why. It questions their assumptions and invites you to see them in a new, perhaps uncomfortable light. Whether you agree or not, it's worth the watch. And the best part? It's free on Kanopy. All you need is a library card to sign in.",False

1,9,Elegies- improvisational journey,YuanYaoYY,n/a,16/08/2025,"Elegies- improvisational journeyAnn, living fossil of Hong Kong new wave, she's pushing the new wave even further towards the direction where she regards as ""future.""
At first stages of watching Elegies, I even regard her as Agn√®s Varda, but as the film plays, more philosophical thinkings unfolds. It seems the content of each parts of the documentary drift in different directions and torn the theme apart. Conventional elements of documentary like POVs even drift, not to mention director's self-present, off-axis, crews invasion, shifts of accents, etc. Ann holds the vibe and brings the auditor ascend to her spiritual level.Few elements I want to point out that, the film was mostly rely on dialogue, most of the director's thinkings, philosophical ideas and metaphors were conveyed & delivered by dialogue. In the post-screening discussion, I asked her about that and she replied not at all ( with laughter) humorous woman indeed. Break the so called law, no doctrine exists, there just free thought with vibe.",False

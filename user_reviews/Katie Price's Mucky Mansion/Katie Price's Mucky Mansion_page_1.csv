1,7,Trash TV but also quite sad,chris_rowe-881-168820,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not a fan of KP, I mean growing up she was the glamour model but even at that time you didn't really know anything about them personally. I do hate a lot of what she's done, preferential treatment, hypocrisy and various things that is just being selfish and narcissistic and putting money and fame over everything. But that's life, I don't hate her, she's done nothing to me, it's just not my type of life choices.Why I watched it was the mental health aspect, whilst im sceptical on certain famous people both cheapening and exploiting the struggle, I don't think Katie does, to see what people have gone out their way to do to her is pretty shocking, I mean I don't like loads of what she's done but I'd never want her kids to suffer or be scared in a home.I think celebrities need to stop getting preferential treatment , the money gets them lavish lifestyle which is on them but the rest should just be treated like the common man, no special treatment. They're not better, especially with what she's famous for, your telling me she's more important than a nurse? No! Everyone is equal but it's choices that make you better.",False
2,1,Vile,nigeldorrington123,n/a,16/08/2025,"A vile and nasty individual who constantly flouts and ignores the law with often serious consequences. The host of a tv show when she should be in jail. She's a vile and utterly wrong person who deserves noting but jail time instead of hawking her family on tv for a few shekels. An unashamedly cash hungry brain dead human Who literally just wants to do anything for fame and notoriety and cold hard cash which she translates into drugs and alcohol.You could do anything better than watching this show such as using the toilet, cleaning up dog mess, emptying the bin or talking to a phone bill, time well spent.",False
3,1,Why's this given air time,medic061076,n/a,16/08/2025,Goes to show being bankrupt both financially and morally only means you get frightening poor facial surgery and fake teeth and still exploiting her son who deserves so much more than a drunkard drug taking bag of silicone for the person was born out of. It's a sad decline of a model who lived off her child for far too long.Which brands would want to be pulled down by this nobody only goes to show how desperate for viewing figures is to put this person on display to help people learn they can be the maker of their own demise. It's a great how not to program. Hii oi w not to behave how not to parent how not to decorate and how not to be a something anyone can look to and say ' I want to look and act like that',False
4,10,What a transformation,whcbkb,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a fan of Katie Price since I was young, I find this series inspirational, shes worked hard to fix her house to a home. Great ideas throughout and Katie being her humble self, love it!! Made me laugh and almost cry, a down to earth beauty.",False
5,1,Unbelievable,quiggvc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Get yourselves out to the pub, get drunk and drive home. Act like a skank become a waste of space piece of trash. Thats the way to get your own tv show. The world has gone mad.",False
6,10,I love this woman!,Ruthie_Powell,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's been such a treat to watch someone who I admire so much transforming her home into something she loves regardless of what anyone else thinks. Her ideas have been inspirational. Pure joy and magic. I've loved watching her inner child let loose on her house. Yes she's loaded so money is no object but still she has purchased average things from average shops and let her imagination run wild and made some really fun girly rooms. So many people decorate their homes always thinking of what other people will think or of other people's opinions or what is considered stylish etc but it's only true gems like Katie that transform their homes into magical dream unique wonderlands. Katie has been through so much. Childhood trauma mixed in with never ending relationship trauma and this has made her a very unique adult with an inner child that needs healing. This home she's created for herself and her beautiful family of lovely children and animals will help her no end in her healing journey. Ironically, it was her sister and boyfriend who came across as the most insecure, always criticising Katie's tastes and ideas instead of just enjoying the journey Katie is on. They obviously care more about what other's think of them than Katie's vision. Which is sad. People being their true authentic selves is the most beautiful thing to witness. There should be more programmes about Katie and her beautiful children. I hope she does not fall for anymore unsuitable men but I think that's inevitable with her mental health issues. I really hope she meets a mature guy next time who's older than her and can look after her emotionally and have her best interests at heart like she needs. I adore her relationship with her kids, it's so cute. Harvey is a dream and all her children seem to be happy and content. So many people are so nasty about Katie online. Guess they're jealous of what a strong amazing stoic woman she is. Never underestimate the Pricey!!!! Love you girl. Never change.",False

1,6,Speak for yourself,edwin-wks,n/a,16/08/2025,"The narrator says, ""the farms that use less water cannot satisfy the world's craving for beef and the farms that produce most of the world's beef are killing off the supply of fresh water for everyone"". That implies the rest of the world consumes meat at the rate that America does and we don't.On my first and only visit to America, I ordered pork chops at a Californian cafe in San Francisco. I made the mistake of ordering a full portion because I was jet lagged and hadn't eaten much that day. It turned out that the full portion was not one but two huge pork chops. Anywhere else in the world a full portion would simply be one entire pork chop, not two.While it is happening across the world, America is still the world leader in consumerism. Americans generally pay less for the same product compared to the rest of the world even though the raw materials come from elsewhere and manufacture takes place in other countries. When it comes to raping its own environment and that of the rest of the world, no other country does it better than the good ole USA.",False
2,8,Mandatory watch even though it's hopeless.,deloudelouvain,n/a,16/08/2025,"I kept postponing watching this documentary as I wasn't in a good mindset to watch something that you know beforehand it will make you sad. Day Zero should be a mandatory watch to the whole world, maybe to open some eyes in the hope we would wake up and revolt, but when I see that half of the reviews on here are from people that calls this rubbish or propaganda then you know enough, you know we're doomed. Day Zero is an eye opener, well mine were already open for a long time but still. A well made and narrated documentary where you can learn interesting things from, like the underground reservoirs that seemed endless but certainly aren't, the need for meat that is actually the main cause for the coming catastrophe, the unwillingness from people that are supposed to rule us and thus also protect to change anything about Day Zero, the day that is fast approaching. I must think of Bolsonaro in Brazil, you know the far right wing former president, whos goal it was to destroy the rain forest, the lungs of our beloved planet, just to make more profits for multi-nationals. Humanity is going to hit a brick wall, at full force, and it's unstoppable, certainly not with the narrow minded people we have here, that seem to have the IQ of an amobea. I don't have kids, I'm vegan, I try to be self sufficient, so yes I try, but it's a lost battle and to be honest I will probably watch this doomsday scenario from a retiring home, like an apocalyptic movie. Glad I have no kids.",False
3,8,What will you do if you knew what I know?,beyond-infinite05,n/a,16/08/2025,A harrowing look at the impeding doom. The documentary itself of course covers the topic that should be one of the foremost agenda for world govts across the globe. And it does good job at conveying the message too. Wish more people wake up to where we are heading instead of living without any sort of farsightedness.,False
4,n/a,Useless movie,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie doesn't address the root cause of water depletion which is animal agriculture. It makes the assumption that water deletion is ""just happening "" The producers should be ashamed . Waste of resources.",False
5,10,Everyone Needs To See This NOW!,gbkimberley,n/a,16/08/2025,"I find it appalling that it appears, at this time, that so few people have watched this yet.As no one is going to do anything about it before it's too late. And it may already be too late. What are we going to tell our grandchildren when the water is all gone? This is frightening viewing and everyone needs to watch this. EVERYONE!",False
6,8,This is a real eyeopener for Humanity!,virginiakennedy,n/a,16/08/2025,"But I doubt if we Humans will take it seriously, the Water shortages continue to get worse yet people are quadrupling the World population and remain in denial, even though there are all these shortages of land and water the Human population continues to explode, Humanity is moving towards the edge of the Cliff, we have gone to far in one direction to go back, the best we can hope for is a large rock hitting Earth and starting over, we are a failed species on Earth, we deluded ourselves into thinking we were the most Intelligent Species on the Planet, This is not intelligence at work. During the commercial breaks I couldn't believe some of the Commercials they allowed, one Woman had 8 children and was in labor with her 9th baby, this does not make sense to run a commercial during Day Zero when the Earth is massively overpopulated with Humans and Water and Land is disappearing at a rapid rate, 80% of the Land is being used by Humans in Africa to grow food, that leaves no room for Africa's Animals, plus we are destroying plant species at the same rate, I could talk to people about it but their more interested in going shopping at Kohls or wherever, people want to stay in denial, it's easier and softer!",False
7,8,"Water Problems well defined, Need other films for possible solutions.",thewhale-49134,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am very glad that I watched David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet (2020) & KISS THE GROUND (2020) before seeing this documentary. They are more general and provided a Problem-Solution approach.This documentary has done a good job of bringing together
locals, advocates and experts from some of the affected areas of the world. The Brazilian Rain Forest scientist is really dedicated and inclusive of all populations. He readily offers up that the native people understood the dynamics of the forest correctly, long before modern science.NASA satellites are used as a key element to tie together some regions of the world and the whole planet. Coverage is impressive and visually stunning. Overview to specific to connectedness to overview to specific to...For instance: The Cape Town water shortage footage, interviews, and expert perspectives provided valuable insights to help identify the causes of the problem - Past, Present and Future. Dry reservoir compared to 3 yrs prior was especially interesting to see, up close.Yet it appears that so many problems exist, without the populations understanding why these issues are happening, that the documentary budgeted it's time to explain many of the problems we face, and so offers few solutions. The American farmer was able to say only one sentence about Regenerative Farming techniques.",False
8,2,No inspiration only propaganda,ianas,n/a,16/08/2025,"While most of what was presented in this documentary is true the way they did it reminded me of old school propaganda videos I'm not sure if this documentary had a proper script or not what we got is a rant by that swedish girl who cried about stuff without any life experience, what is true is parts of the world are growing and drinking water will become much more expensive that's nothing new this documentaries author has nothing more than it's your fault, I recently watched another documentary called river about water and that one was both aye opening and good avoid this political propaganda.",False
9,1,Good lord...,fambizzsales,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yet another ""documentary"" for weak minds. The world has been ""running out"" of oil, food, room, energy. (insert resource here) for the past century. These films are made for that portion of the population that hates their own humanity. These simpletons want population control and a return to pre-industrial times.Here's a term you've probably never heard from the Western DNC controlled media...""saltwater greenhouses"". It's exactly what it sounds like, salty ocean water is pumped into greenhouses to grow fruits and vegetables AND produce fresh water. It happens to work best in places like Africa where you have ocean and desert side by side. Research it, you'll be amazed what you're not being told...",False
10,1,Simply a Lie.,joeonj,n/a,16/08/2025,"All the water consumed on earth returns to the earth through the natural evaporation cycle. We all learned this in elementary school.Also, here's a line copied from Wikipedia:
""While it is difficult to estimate the total water content of the mantle due to limited samples, approximately three times the mass of the Earth's oceans could be stored there. Similarly, the Earth's core could contain four to five oceans' worth of hydrogen.""
These films are produced by simple minded producers to scare the population. Don't just believe them, do your own investigations.Think about all the scams being pushed now days.",False

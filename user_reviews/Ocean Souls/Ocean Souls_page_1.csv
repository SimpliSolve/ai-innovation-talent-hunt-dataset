1,8,"Pathos and science, head and heart",TheRealMarQs,n/a,16/08/2025,"A visually stunning and emotianally packed whale documentary, touching on many different species. Particularly in the imagery, I don´t think I´ve seen this many species in one doc before?Its emphasis is as much -or perhaps more- on making a moral as well as emotional call to humanity, as it is about the scientific facts about whales. For the most part it manages a nice balance between pathos and science. However, sometimes I found the tone slightly too emphatic and the facts delivered being a little too haphazard and unsubstantiated. As an example: It is one thing to say that cetaeceans have a much greater capacity of empathy than formerly given credit for, it is a completely different thing to say that they have greater empathy than humans. How is empathy quantified and measured here, or even quantifiable at all? Empathy isn´t a contest anyway, and why must everything always be measured against man? I sympathize 100% with their intentions though!A film with a big heart, a beautiful exterior, some science and a lot of sweet observations/anecdotes on or off camera.",False
2,9,Wow!,jkressmann-532-345773,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is highly informative, stunningly beautiful, and inspirational. I finished it will a sense of awe and wonder for the interdependence of all life on earth. It is a tragedy that we have already destroyed so much of the natural world. I hope that it isn't too late to save the rest - and ourselves. If we are able to do it, it will be in no small part because of the wisdom and dedication of people like this filmmaker along with the many marine life specialists who do tirelessly work to better understand these magnificent creatures, how we relate to them,!and what we can continue to learn from them. By doing so, we will find the depths of our own humanity.",False

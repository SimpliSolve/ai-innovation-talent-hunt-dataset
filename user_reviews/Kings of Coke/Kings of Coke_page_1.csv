1,8,coke and...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCocain cowboys have always fascinated me and my curiousity on true life crime stories. Not that im a pro guy on the subject , but the heinousity vs the need for speed kinda kick the box childrens game seems to embrace me each time i come over something new on the coke block.Its a question of demand, its as simple as that, somebody supplies the market, and politicians once upon a time in the commonwealth of canada said that it was a criminal act to do so...and that has craved lots of seeping blood and 1000's of fatalities within the crime world, as well as killing 100000's of drugusers more or less due to the uncontrolled use of drugs, its hidden away and its a crime to use, maybe it wouldve cleansed society in a better manner letting coke become a state controlled substance, like methadone and subutex has done to emancipate hard core drug user over the years.that wouldve created a great competition to the crime organizations, and ''ca ching'' a lot of tax money, that could benefit the reclamation of drug addicts.Its not a serious proposal and no pun intended by the way, but the war on drugs havent been a success yet, so consider it as a grumpy old mans last thought.I liked this documentary, their use of archive material, that gives a view and a sense of the zeitgeist of the era. Its slipping a bit in the last quater, making me think that they shouldve covered all ''the gangs of montreal'' in a 6-8 parts tv series. Its too shallow for a 10 star award, but otherwise highly recommended if your a buff on the tlc subject.",True
2,10,Riveting!,Ej-36091,n/a,16/08/2025,"A riveting and wild story or crime, drugs and Irish gangs. A must watch for true crime/mafia buffs! Can't believe all of this went down in Montreal and that it was once considered the crime capital of the world. Clearly a lot of work went into this film and piecing it all together. I love the way the storytelling was pieces together with the interviews, audio, animations, old footage and a film-noir-sequel lense. I enjoyed this movie so much more than I expected as I'm not normally a mafia movie type of gal. It would make such a good film series if they did this format for all the big gang groups around the world. My fingers are crossed for a sequel! ü§ûüèª",False

1,9,She really wanted to talk about the issues,Red-125,n/a,15/08/2025,"A Run for More (2022) was directed by Ray Whitehouse. It's a documentary about Frankie Gonzales-Wolfe who ran for city council in San Antonio Texas. Jeff Wolfe, her husband, supports his wife in her quest.Frankie is clear that her campaign isn't about her gender. It's about pressing problems that she hopes to correct.However, the public--at least in San Antonio--won't let go of her gender, even when they see her strong ex-military husband standing by her side.We saw this movie virtually as part of Rochester's wonderful ImageOut LGBT Film Festival. There are too few ratings to make the IMDb rating meaningful. I thought it was an excellent documentary, and rated it 9.",False

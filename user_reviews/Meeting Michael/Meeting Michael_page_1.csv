1,6,MJ The Goat,vukasboris,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary is really simple but in that simplicity we met Adam Kontras,MJ's fan and in him I saw me bcs like him I was insane as a kid for Michael and to this day love him...he is in - synonym for success!!Mr Kontras gave us story about his experience,as adult man when he saw Jordan live in game when he went on bball game Cavs-Bulls with press pass.
The best part for me is the final third of this story where he caught some interesting things in and of the court on sideline with his video camera.I also liked his conclusion/ending where he connected life,family,passion,joy,sadness and made a nice message to all us viewers.",False
2,9,A Great The Last Dance Chaser,Mr64Source,n/a,16/08/2025,"Coming off the heels of watching The Last Dance, and basking in the classic Michael moments throughout his career, this was a very different way to revisit my nostalgia for that time. Through Adam's eyes, between his unique footage and in retelling some tales to his kids, it was fascinating to see and hear the details of an incredible opportunity he's now able to share so many years later. The sounds of the crowd on the floor, the classic music playing in the arena, and a bunch of chatter between the players and then from a heckler or two are something most people would never experience but this brings it home.It's not a traditional documentary by any means, and at times there can be passages where aside from merely enjoying the footage he has it doesn't necessarily have direction, but the structure of relaying the information organically to his kids works well enough. That can also make for some amusing observations and questions that any parent will get a laugh at no doubt.This is absolutely a unique experience that anyone with a reverence for Michael and the Bulls from that era should get a kick out of and enjoy!",False
3,10,Every Michael Jordan fan's dream,jdraimer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a lifelong fan of Michael Jordan and as a kid who always had a video camera in his hands, this documentary hits home. Home video from right on the court is a perspective you never get to see, so it's awesome that Adam shares this unique footage with the audience...and his children. A great heartfelt story that proves if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.",False

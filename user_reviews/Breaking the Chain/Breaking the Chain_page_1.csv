1,8,"Wow, what a viceral reminder of how bad it is for some.",wbsimsjr-32405,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have to admit that like the other reviewer, it brought a few tears to see the conditions these poor pets get stuck in. My lil furry goofball must have understood what was on the screen, several times he growled and looked up to me. To see animals tied up outside a home with little to no shelter, huddled around a tree trunk or wrapped up around a broken piece of machinery to just laying down with a completely defeated sadness in their eyes is heart-breaking. The movie is a barrage of the worst people do to animals and their injuries. Not for the faint of heart..",True
2,10,PETA Please Help Those Poor Animals,untilnow99,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tears are rolling down my cheeks. I had to stop watching after only 10 minutes. Seeing dogs tethered for life will give me nightmares till the end of my days.My dog just got back from an 8-mile walk and yesterday he was walked 11+ miles. It's insane for people to think dogs don't need to run and play. For those poor, poor dogs to be chained and left outside in all kinds of weather-----I hope PETA can make such neglect illegal, not only in the USA, but collaborate to stop tethering worldwide.PETA. I remember when people used to make fun of PETA. Now, the group is a force to be reckoned with. If you have money to spare, please do what I do and donate to help stop animal suffering.",False
3,5,um..,dion_pangallo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I get it, its a noble cause, but unfortunately americans are by and large lazy, selfish, delusional and dumb, in pretty much everything they do. it should be illegal to own a dog larger than a cat if you live in an apartment. same for a house that has less than an acre of land. those abusing animals should get mandatory YEARS in prison and never be allowed access to a pet every again. period. but itll never ever happen in this 21st century dimwit american society we have created for ourselves. ""get yours!"". pathetic.",False

1,8,A quite rushed project but very good,Rodrigo_Amaro,n/a,16/08/2025,"This GloboPlay special report on infamous former cop/alderman/YouTubber Gabriel Monteiro was very informative and well presented despite its rushed tone. It was so
unusual seeing the network making a four-part special of half-hour each since the majority of their projects usually go with a full hour and they're all great (the ones I've
seen so far, at least). But it was very good, addictive and you can binge watch this for some nice two hours.It came an appropriate time when all the repercussions against the man took place over 2022, with massive media coverage about his impeachment by Rio City Council after
multiple alegations of sexual assault, abuse of power and missconduct. It was a busy year talking about him and his controversial acts with more and more denounces against
him and that's pretty much what viewers will follow with this documentary.I remember him somewhat back during his political campaign and the internet videos of him breaking through hospitals following the bad management and lack of medical
doctors to attend the population and I thought this was something good and interesting to follow, it's like a costumers complaint like many other folks do out there in the
media but he went after critical public services and since he had a political career it was easier to inspect and demand for service for the needed people. It was quite brute I thought but effective. With those, came his great rise to fame becoming an important name in Rio politics.Then came the denounces against Gabriel, his involvement with underaged girls and plenty of criticism against his inspection videos since it was
all edited down to make him look good. Almost everything you know about the news reports are here. But there are some missing things and that's why I had some criticism
about this rushed project. Though it is revealed plenty of things about his conduct with his own staff with sexual harassment with both female and male staff members (the ones
about the guys was not divulged in the media in the way it is presented here), more wood to the controversy bonfire could and should be added, things we all heard in the news
such as the video where he punches a young man who was verbally challenging him with some remarks, and the outrageous video where he coaches a homeless man in pretending to
have stolen a women's purse so he could make a video of the man's arrest - that one is a sick, sad and harsh video to watch. And the filmmakers had the time to include those
critical moments but they just stick to the key issues such as the sexual assaults and the voting for his impeachment.For those interested in current political events and how the apparently righteous right-wingers shaped our society in the past couple of years this is a must-see
documentary in order to analyze and comprehend facts, situations and how certain narratives were created in order to create saints and saviors but reality came to surface
and twisted things back to a strange order. There's plenty to be learned here. 8/10.",False

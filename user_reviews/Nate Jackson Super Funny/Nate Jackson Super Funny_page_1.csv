1,10,Very Funny,mikki-51027,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was my first encounter with Nate's work and it was a resounding success, surpassing my expectations. I am eager to explore more of his content. His comedic style is hilarious, engaging and entertaining. He effectively captured and maintained my attention as well as his audience. Nate's sharp wit and clever delivery have sparked my interest in viewing his future work. His performance was thoroughly enjoyable. I hope he has many more projects in the works. I will certainly pass on my thoughts to friends and family so that they can experience his hilarious humor. Nate is the one to watch for greatness!!",False

3,10,Nate delivers once again!!,ismawshank25,n/a,16/08/2025,"I mostly watched Nate Jackson's crowd work, but this special was indeed special. He mixed it up, some jokes to warm up the room, his iconic crowd work, then finished with a smart joke.In terms of crowd work, Nate is easily one or two in the nation, and his jokes are not far off. His crowd work is great roasting but you can see he can draw the lines based on the reactions and sensitivity of the roasting subject. This shows great emotional awareness, which is a must to keep the bond between a comedian and his base. Sad the monthly crowd joint is not monthly anymore, but I hope it will be back soon!!",False

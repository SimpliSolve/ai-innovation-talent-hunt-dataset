1,9,Outstanding!,npvarley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well, if you only know Wyatt Earp from the movies, such as Tombstone (which is a great movie, BTW), then this will open your eyes to the complexity of the real Wyatt Earp.It wasn't all so cut and dried as the movies make it out to be. And events didn't quite go down the way the movies claim. It's actually much more interesting than that!This docu-drama does a great job of layering in the events, all the way from the local events in Tombstone, to the reverberations they caused politically and economically.The drama parts are well acted and the story rattles along at a great pace. They manage to end each episode on a cliffhanger, too.And a special mention for Ed Harris' outstanding narration!I binge-watched it in one evening and i highly recommend it!",False
2,8,The More you Know...,geonick53,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like to think of myself as a student of History, and, I found this take of the Gunfight, to be very Informative. Nothing happens in a vacuum, and, it was interesting to see all the interlocking interests. There were many things, I did not know, and, I've seen many movies, and, other documentaries, that didn't describe all the outside impacts of this gunfight. It's definitely worth a look. Each episode, leaves you wanting to see, what happens next. Bravo, to all involved in the effort to flesh out the story. The series, could easily have been longer, because there were many things, that could have been discussed in a deeper dive.",False
3,8,Superb Documentary,Eric266,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an outstanding documentary on the events surrounding the Earps and the Clantons. I have read and watched plenty of books and documentaries about the events and this still provided new facts I never heard. This is not a straight documentary as they have actors playing the roles in little vignettes of the events. They all do a very commendable job of giving a human touch to the events. Ed Harris is a fantastic narrator. He is not just reading the script.He uses various inflections in his voice to provide either humor or tension to the events he is narrating. He needs to do more of this kind of voicework. Where this show really shines is taking a very broad approach to the the events and discussing outside factors that led to the conflict. Some of these are the hurt feelings still being held by the South after the Civil War, America's debt from the war, trying to pay off that debt with silver from Arizona, said silver getting hijacked by stage coach robbers, J. P Morgan trying to get investors in England to give him loans to buy up the railroads, the recent assassination of President Garfield, Wells Fargo bankrolling Wyatt's Vendetta Ride until it becomes too scandalous, and, finally, the impression people in the East were getting of the West based on the inflammatory news articles in the New York and Washington D. C. papers. President Arthur even sent General Sherman to Arizona to determine if the violence was getting out of hand. Hint: It was. The gunfight at the OK Corral and the aftermath were not happening in a vacuum. They were affecting events all the way to Washington and Europe.All of this is handled with pinpoint storytelling. Each of the six episode focuses on a different aspect of events. In the first episode you get the backstory to include how Tombstone came to exist, the climate in America post-Civil War, and the background on the Earps' and Clantons' conflict. Then you get an episode dealing with the OK Corral gunfight and the alternate views of both sides. There is an entire episode on the preliminary hearing trying the Earps for murder. This was fascinating and the best part of part of the series IMO, as most of the movies skip right over or give very little attention to the details of how close the Earps came to hanging. Ike Clanton comes across as a pretty sly and wily opponent rather than a drunken fool like he is portrayed in the movies. Yes, he drank, but he was also ingenious at times in how he manipulated the press and the townfolk.The one negative I found in this show is the way they completely ignored Johnny Ringo. He is not even mentioned. Michael Biehn deserved better. Haha.I binged this entire series last night as I could not wait for the next episode. A very well done series that deserves to be watched by anyone who enjoys historical documentaries.",False
4,10,Fantastic!!,rclambert-599-968400,n/a,16/08/2025,"My great-great grandfather was a Texas Ranger in Bell County, Texas during the 1870's. He participated in what is believed to have been the last known battle against the Comanche Indians near present day San Saba, Texas. His photograph used to be on display at the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum in Waco, Texas.I have always been absorbed by stories of Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, the James gang...etc. I have read books on those subjects and watched all the documentaries, tv shows, and movies. I've visited Tombstone, Arizona and walked inside the OK Corral. I even visited Jessie James's family home in Missouri. But nothing I've seen or read was as entertaining or informative as ""Wyatt Earp and The Cowboy War"". It does a deep dive into everything the movies and books never seem to accurately or sufficiently cover. I learned things I never knew before.It is narrated by Ed Harris, who I'm a big fan of. The reenactments are great and are filmed in a very dramatic and entertaining way. The casting, directing and acting is very well done. I also thought the music and narration were both top notch. I couldn't stop watching it and was sad when ended.",False
5,10,Unexpected Fun,nathan-34654,n/a,16/08/2025,"When clicking play on a title like this you settle in to learn some history, spoken by a dry cowboy sounding narrator and a series of academics who don't seem like they'd last 5 mins in the west and then finally the occasional cut scene which.... well. Yeah.From the moment this series starts you can tell things are going to be different. The slick editing, great music and scenes which frankly wouldn't look out of place in ""Deadwood"", Wyatt Earp and the Cowboy War pulls you in and keeps you there.It feels like watching The Defiant Ones for the first time, knowing that what you are watching is redefining a genre.Ed Harris's narration is spot on, casual and humorous, keeping the story going in a nearly 'telling you over a beer' kind of a way. Meanwhile the cut scenes are lavish, cinematic and captivating.The guy who plays Wyatt Earp (Tim Fellingham) is the perfect casting to counter Ed's chilled vibe as he blasts his way through the west with a quick draw and a chilling stare. Surrounded by a great supporting cast they bring this little known and vastly complex story to life in a way that feels new and bang on the times.",False
6,10,FANTASTIC Background Information!,yellowtoad,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a TOURGUIDE in Arizona that visits Tombstone often, I was fascinated by the pauses during the programs re-enactments while listening to Ed Harris' explanation of the backstories and politics that were involved with the situation. It was fascinating, surprising, and eye-opening - if not jaw dropping.Most of us know the Wyatt Earp/Tombstone story and have probably seen the 1993 Kurt Russell/Val Kilmer TOMBSTOME film...This is not a Glamorized Hollywood movie. It's much like a documentary, where the backstory and ""dots"" connected were jaw dropping at times. It was quite the Spiderweb. You'll watch this and recognize the parallels consistent with today's corruption in the media, with Politicians, and big businesses.I promise you, you will sit up in your chair, put your hand over your forehead and realize, WOW...SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE!I've recommended this to my entire team of Tour guides, and they agree - It's very informative, entertaining, fascinating and very WELL DONE!",False
7,10,Outstanding,tag2308,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love the buildup to the gunfight and the story of the aftermath. A piece of history that is normally unheard. Presents the characters as they were, not as popular history paints them. And Ed Harris's narration is the best I have ever heard. A thoroughly enjoyable series.I love it when stories continue on and show what is historically accurate and where the characters end up. I was unaware that this tale was far more involved than the dime store novel version. I enjoyed every episode, the ending of one leaving you wanting more. This was the perfect series to binge watch, which I did while recovering from Covid. It also opened up a desire to learn more about each character. Kudos to Netflix for a wonderful job!!",False
8,n/a,I usually don't like reenactment documentaries but the acting was very well done.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a fan of western films, Tombstone and Unforgiven being two of my favorites I was apprehensive when I realized there were reenactments. I was pleasantly surprised with the actors. Wyatt, Doc ,Virgil and Behan really stood out. As far as the historical accuracy goes I'm not sure. It definitely paints a different picture than Tombstone and the Costner film. Tombstone portrayed Curly Bill as the ring leader of the cowboys. According to this Ike Clanton was the one in charge. I could tell that the actor playing Doc Holiday really took some inspiration from Val Kilmer. That's a good thing in my opinion.",True
9,6,Where to begin...,missbusanbeth,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a really entertaining show, but it's just that, a show. Despite what other reviews have said, it's not a documentary. A docudrama, perhaps. Anyway, I seem to be in the minority in that I found that it added little to my understanding of the events and the historical figures. Of course if your only knowledge of this era and series of events is ""Tombstone"", then I imagine this series is pretty interesting. I thought the attempts to tie the story into larger political and social frameworks was a little heavy handed and honestly not backed up by any historical documentation. They mention a lot of sources but never show them or quote directly from them. They also present Wyatt and the Earps as well intentioned lawmen driven to violence. Wyatt sent his common law wife to another stat and then ""forgot"" to join her there when he ran off with another woman. He was suspected of occasionally pumping and it's known that he roughed up rivals of political figures that befriended or paid him. Maybe not out-and-out evil but not the hero of the story.Overall it was a fun watch but I'd be cautious about accepting any of it as historical fact.",False
10,8,Just 15 minutes in and I AM HERE FOR IT,rdatsoy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although there are plenty of documentaries that do the acting along the way as they're explaining the history, the pacing and overall storytelling is just really fun. It's different than other acting documentaries I've seen for that reason. I especially love how the historical context gives more support to the acting. And they really did a great job casting Wyatt Earp. He's borderline perfect. Even if he is Australian ;)It's different than other acting documentaries I've seen for that reason. I especially love how the historical context gives more support to the acting. And they really did a great job casting Wyatt Earp.",False
11,7,Mostly Historical....,mike-in-estes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why does a documentary have to fudge? Lots of cowboys wearing modern cowboy hats...the shootout right at the OK Corral when it actually happened well down the street.... This is supposed to clear up historical errors, not reinforce them. And that's just a bit of the first episode. The production values are great, and the cast is almost flawless. What happened to fact checking? I'll watch the rest of it but I cannot say that I am happy about the loose handling of the facts. This is history. The truth is well known. There are a lot of interesting connections in this showing how everything fit within the larger world. Now I wonder how much of it is fact and how much is embellished.",False
12,9,Popcorn viewing!,pastorfbt,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerEven as I'm still going through this one I'm sold. Of course although the Kurt Russell ""Tombstone"" is the epic fictional treatment, this ""documentary"" fills in the story, the surrounding events both here and abroad, and the fallout through years later.Many of the minute details of what happened initially in Tombstone are either copied from the movie, or - if independently sourced (I don't know which) - confirm the movie's details. Specifically the gunfight as it was staged and how it unfolded. A nice ironic touch is that the actor who plays Wyatt bears a slight resemblance - around the eyes - to Michael Biehn, who was Johnny Ringo in the movie.",True
13,4,"Historically accurate, maybe but the show is rife with period, flora and geological inaccuracies",movinman-65944,n/a,16/08/2025,"Might be smooth cinematography but they should have paid more attention to historically and geographically accurate details. Clearly this wasn't filmed in Arizona as the scenery nor geography matches. Furthermore plants from outside Arizona show up throughout the episodes. Hickory, Eastern Goldenrod and tall hardwoods in general abound; none of which grow in or around Tombstone. Modern locks can be seen on doors, eastern log cabins with chinked and mortar are shown as if in Tombstone which simply do not exist there. Cedar shake roofs were very limited in southern AZ unless imported. They are seen often in the show. Too bad because its very distracting! The show would have been much more believable and enjoyable if it would have been filmed in Southern Arizona as all those issues would have been avoided. Do better Hollywood, do better!",False
14,10,"Quite possibly one of the best narrated, best acted, and best produced / directed documentaries in American film history",albertcattell,n/a,16/08/2025,"The true story is simply mind boggling, filled to the brim with countless unexpected twists and turns, known by very few in America. Expertly crafted and executed in every regard. The writing, the acting, the narration, producing and directing are second to none. The only documentary that might come close would possibly be The Hatfields & McCoys (Kevin Costner). Ed Harris has always been a truly exceptional narrator, but this, unquestionably was one of his best performances of his entire career (in my opinion). If you like all the hallmarks of a glued to your screen with unpredictable twists and turns every minute, Wyatt Earp and The Cowboy Wars is an absolute must watch.",False
15,10,Fantastic,madcat5050,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOur family has a been a part of Tombstone for 7 decades. As many times as we've walked the boardwalk of Allen street, dozens of visits to the OK Corral, the recreations, visiting the Tombstone Epitaph...we thought we knew the story.After watching this beautifully produced and narrated series, we really know the story. The context, connections to the globe.JP Morgan, trans-Atlantic telegraph, the Prince of Wales, Rothschild, Civil war debt, President Garfield, Silver Certificates, TB, advancements in Dental and Surgical practices - all are masterfully woven together. Stunning imagery and masterful filming.I cannot thank the producers enough to doing this story about justice such a great treatment.",True
16,9,Almost perfect,drjgardner,n/a,16/08/2025,"This docudrama about the West, and more particularly, Tombstone and the Earps, is one of the best written, if not the best written, stories about what really happened. Through multiple sources looking at multiple aspects, we get a full idea of what was happening. How London to New York to Washington to Arizona all come into play between the Civil War, the railroad, the stagecoach, cattle, the newspapers, etc. Is a wonder. Marvelous writing and homework on the part of the producers and writers. It's literally like nothing you've ever seen before.Why not a 10? Well, it's the acting. The acting isn't up to a 10 level. Everything else is, so that's why it gets a 9. The acting isn't bad, but when everything else is perfect, it could use a slight boast.",False
17,9,Incredible acting!,lynnek-10863,n/a,16/08/2025,"GOOF: Ep3 At 31:33 when Wyatt's lawyer went to answer the door, you can see a digital thermostat with the green glow, on the wall, on the right side of the door.GOOF: Ep6 when they show horse and carriage up north riding through the city, they horses are on asphalt
The storytelling is really good, pulled me in from the start. Has me googling these historic figures and old newspaper clippings. The acting is amazingly good! I don't recognize anyone from the big screen but they are better than most known names.Narrator comes in at the perfect time with his deep, frontier voice.I've never been into cowboy stories before but this series might have just have gotten a new fan of the wild, Wild West! Love it!",False
18,10,A review by an Earp.,stevewearp,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an Earp Family member, descended from Wyatt's youngest uncle Jonathan Douglas Earp of Lamar, MO., it always scares me when someone snaps off another documentary or film about the Earps. This one was definitely met with applause and sighs of relief. Very factual and very well researched.Loved the blend of history to acted scenes and loved how they got to the heart of the personalities of these men as their motivation for their parts. With all I've read and researched on Wyatt, Virgil, Morgan, and Doc, they truly nailed their personalities. Some of this I know to be true simply from the hardwired traits of Earp family members. We all have that impatience and proclivity to punch out our problems when needed. We all tend to drive everyone else crazy with our stubborn adherence to our personal codes as well. We all tend to gain either love or hate but never very bland responses in either direction. I sure so wish they throw us some goddamn royalties for as much money as they bank on our name though.",False
19,8,"""You could say he lived by his own moral code, but he was determined to see justice served."" - Episode #1",classicsoncall,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've taken something of a keen interest in the history of Wyatt Earp and the Gunfight at the O. K. Corral for quite some time and have seen quite a few documentaries and movies made concerning the Earps, Doc Holiday and the infamous gunfight. This series by far has a level of detail unparalleled when it comes to events leading up to and following the infamous event, along with a historical perspective regarding some of the events happening in the rest of the country and the world at the time. In particular, I found it fascinating how industrialist J. P. Morgan was woven into the story with his plan to consolidate the railroad system in the country. There's even coverage of President Chester A. Arthur's role in intervening in the aftermath of the Cowboy War that erupted in Tombstone between that faction and the Earps.Even so, there were discrepancies from the historical narrative that someone familiar with the history of it would find questionable. As detailed as most of the series was, I couldn't help noticing that the name of Billy Claiborne wasn't mentioned as one of the participants in the gunfight on the side of Ike Clanton's cowboy faction. In fact, when the showdown is first examined in Episode #2, there were six participants on the cowboy side when there were only five historically. Along with Ike Clanton, you had his younger brother Billy, Frank and Tom McLaury, and young Billy Claiborne. Later in the same episode, when Ike Clanton (Jack Gordon) relates the event to Sheriff Johnny Behan (Alex Price), the scenario depicted only five men including Clanton against the Earps. That's the way it was also depicted in Episode #3 during Ike's testimony in court as to what happened.Another thing I found questionable was how specific the narrative was in Episode #2 as to the arrangement of shots fired by the participants. This one had a nervous Billy Clanton firing first to start the gunfight. The 'Deadly Shootouts' TV series stated that Wyatt took the first shot, while the 'Legends and Lies' episode featuring Doc Holiday, perhaps because he was the principal character, had him as the first shooter. Personally, I don't know how anyone could have possibly pinned it down unless they were right there at the time, and it's pretty doubtful that Tombstone's citizens would have been hanging around to see these two factions square off against each other with bullets flying. What I find consistent among most of the treatments of the showdown is that there were approximately thirty shots fired in a span of thirty seconds by both sides. The sequence of who shot who and when in this story is no more likely than a best guess.On the other hand, I've never come across another documentary to offer the name of the doctor who treated the wounded Virgil and Morgan Earp and Doc Holiday, or the names of the lawyers who represented Wyatt and Ike Clanton in the court trial accusing Wyatt of murder. Virtually every episode details how duplicitous and conniving Ike Clanton was in turning the tide of opinion against the Earps in Tombstone, portraying them as murderers and government men intent on stepping on the rights of ordinary citizens. The emotions of the town seemed to seesaw their way back and forth between respect and hatred for the Earps depending on who was telling the story. In actuality, the Earps did tread a fine line regarding the law in Tombstone, operating almost like a protection racket while overseeing their interests in the town's saloons and prostitution trade.Overall though, this is probably the best researched coverage of the Gunfight at the O. K. Corral and its aftermath that you'll be able to find, given my few reservations mentioned earlier. I liked actor Tim Fellingham in the role of Wyatt Earp. He reminded me of Timothy Olyphant in the HBO series ""Deadwood"". Jack Gordon was a perfectly despicable Ike Clanton, while the rest of the cast did a serviceable job. Somewhat humorously, one of the locales selected for the filming of the Tombstone area included a wide expanse of the Monument Vally in Utah, prominent in a bunch of director John Ford's Westerns. Because I was there as recently as last year, I recognized West Mitten Butte, Mitten Butte, and Merrick Butte all visible in more than one scene. Still, those minor distractions shouldn't affect your overall enjoyment of the series.",True
20,1,Buntline? Nope.,rutlandroman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Credibility problems. Wyatt Earp never used a colt buntline. The dodge city scene? The wearing of Guns was prohibited in Dodge at the time. The narration is comical and the clothing the actors wear is clownish. Wyatt Earp was not really a town sheriff in Tombstone - he was deputized. The Earps in general were suspected of the stage coach robbery with good cause. Our hero was a dirt bag- not brought up in the series. The series also ignored thst the Earps ran crooked gambling enterprises and house of ill/ repute. Yes, houses of prostitution - not mentioned. Josephine, Wyatt's 2nd common law wife was a prostitute - yep Wyatt got in line. True, Wyatt was a tough character and went berserk on revenge killings for his brother's death. Wyatt was no angel.",False
21,9,Can't Stop Thinking About It,untilnow99,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerKind of weird, but somehow this series is haunting my thoughts. I'll be going about my business and all of a sudden I'll start thinking about Arizona and Wyatt and what life was back in those days. So bizarre to think that Wyatt Earp lived to see the Roaring 20s, Prohibition, Women's Right to Vote, Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Amazing how he dodged bullet after bullet, too.When I saw this docudrama listed on Netflix, I thought it was only a series, not some documentary. ""Oh. This has been done so many times. Probably nothing new,"" was my initial reaction. Boy, was I wrong. I learned so much about Earp and Doc Holliday. Things I never ever heard of before. Enlightening, to say the least.Tim Fellingham and Edward Franklin were awesome in this. And to think ----- as soon as I heard Ed Harris narrating this, I nearly turned it off. I love Harris, but didn't want to watch a documentary. So glad I stuck with it.Everything about the production is top notch. I recommend this series highly.",True
22,10,Really good!!,RatherRead,n/a,16/08/2025,"Many countries have stories of national heroes and places - King Arthur, Roland, El Cid. I've always held that the frontier West and the characters that inhabited it are the national stories of the USA. I've always been interested in Wyatt Earp and have seen just about all the movies about him and read several books. This series is the best. The acting is good and I can't praise Ed Harris enough for his excellent narration. I liked how they put the story of Tombstone, the silver mines and the US debt for the Civil War into the story.My one complaint was the actor who played Chester A. Arthur didn't look at all like him. Where was the mustache and mutton chops that Arthur had? It wouldn't have been hard for makeup to do.",False
23,9,A perfect documentary with a taste of genuine western soul,ocenkg,n/a,16/08/2025,I didn't expect to be watching a splendid production dedicated to a 360° approach to one of the greatest stories of revenge and survival in Wild Wild West.Since I was a little boy. I have been interested in westerns as they took me to those times filled with action and anarchy and not the least freedom.Thank you . Both the story telling and acts were top notch. I collapsed before Netflix and could not bingwatch.You should not miss it . Listening to Ed Harris present us this great mortal combat of the Earps against a bunch of outlaws is mesmerising.Thank you all to the crew.

24,10,Gripping,tftz-04838,n/a,16/08/2025,"A thrilling series with an immersive cinematography and a great narration by Ed Harris. It's a masterful depiction of the legendary lawman's life, offering an engaging narrative that captivates from start to finish. The cinematography beautifully captures the rugged landscapes of the Old West, providing a perfect backdrop to the story. The acting is strong throughout, with each actor delivering a compelling performance that brings the historical characters to life.

25,9,"Even with Only Voice, Ed Harris is Great",wishbinvisible,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, to IMDB, if they are reading this, I am tired of dealing with having to put in a prescribed number of characters to submit a review. Sometimes a review can be done quite well in few characters. But requiring this long-winded nonsense is pointless.OK, my review. Ed Harris makes this series incredibly good. But not to take away from the characters, Netflix did an excellent job hiring very good actors for every portrayal. If you are a history buff, this is a must-see version of the life and times of the Earp family versus the Cowboys during the era of the OK corral confrontation.This is a Netflix production at its best. It is well worth watching as opposed to the many listings Netflix has of foreign movies from India, China, Russia. Just ignore those and stick with productions as well done as this one.",False

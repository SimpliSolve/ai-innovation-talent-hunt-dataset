1,10,A wacky and enjoyable show.,qnzjgpkj,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a lovely show presented by two lovely people. It has an inherent gentleness which some shows of this ilk lack, and that is one of its great charms.Harry Cole is clearly not as others, but is an engaging and off-beat presenter, with a great sense of humour and a very personable way with things.Sam Lovegrove, again, comes over extremely well and is very calm and demure.Both these two men have a vast knowledge, which they wear lightly, not trying to impress you with the fact that they really do know what they are talking about.The show has a clear strategy, buying old stuff in need of some tlc, doing it up somewhat and selling on quickly for a nice mark-up.They have a in-built enthusiasm which comes across well, but which never becomes suffocating or self-indulgent.I'd recommend this show to anyone who loves old things, cars, bikes, motorbikes, trucks, signs, lamps, etc. This show is not all about money, mercifully, it's about two nice and interesting chaps bringing things back to life with a passion, knowledge and gentle charm.",False
2,7,A nice little earner,jas_barnes,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've watched a few of Henry Cole's programs and most are enjoyable. He is an odd character though in a nice way.In this program they drive to a farm, business or even a residential location to find items of machinery or 'automobilia' they think they can add value or make money from. Often this involves haggling to getting a price they think they have a chance of making money from. Sometimes they don't make a profit though normally do and have some fun and banter with Sam initially and then later Fuzz and also with Guy and Alan.Also don't forget Jelly or is it Bean, Henry keeps calling his small dog by different name as he does his friends too, like Fuzza or it is Fuzzinator or Fuzzington.....",False

1,9,I enjoyed the narrator,dbotes,n/a,16/08/2025,"For me Patton Oswalt is a good narrator and I enjoyed him in this series. As a South African I am aware of the penguins in Simon's Town, but this is the 1st time I was able to follow their journey inside the town.",False
2,9,Great all around,robertsig,n/a,16/08/2025,"Videography, editing, storyline, penguin ""families"" to root for. I know these documentaries end up shooting hundreds or thousands of hours, but it's the post-processing that makes it come alive. Well done.",False
3,7,really interesting,That_1_guy,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is a lot of amazing footage of penguins, also the narration adds personality to the penguins and story, highlighting the intelligence of these birds in a more human way of understanding.Solid 7/10.",False
4,10,Absolutely Amazing!!!,candynunu,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved every minute of it, and that's mostly because of the narrator. I have never laughed so hard and learned so much. Oswalt should narrate every documentary on earth!!!! Can't wait for next season!!!",False
5,10,"Heartfelt, educational and adorable!",racheldavidson0,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely loved this little show. This documentary is done very differently to most - it follows the penguins of Simon's Town around while narrating in the cutest (but informative) way. It teaches you a lot, but it's also like a mini adventure that you follow along with the penguins. As a South African, it was amazing to see Simon's Town in its glory and I am so happy this documentary was made. I really hope it gets another season! We utterly adored it.",False
6,10,"Funny, unique documentary on African Penguins",jabodenheimer,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is definitely one of the most entertaining documentaries I've ever seen! The format is almost like a reality show, with the intro and the way the penguins are described. The show is extremely funny and there's plenty of suspense to make you want to binge every episode in a night! This is definitely worth the watch, cute penguins and funny situations are in every episode!",False
7,10,Give me more penguins!!!,aishikaangel,n/a,16/08/2025,"When it comes to documentaries, especially those about animals often tend to be boring. However, this was a tear jerker and a emotional ride as we saw the penguins nest, have their troubles, and finally the chicks were able to graduate. The narration is top class and it helps to retain your interest throughout the series. Mr. Bougainvillea is the best dad ever!! Go watch it guys.",False
8,7,very cute and fun to watch,suego-49293,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love how it follows the lives of several specific penguins, pairs and families. Very well done. The only thing that ruins it for me is Patton Oswalt narrating it. Had they chosen someone else, this could have been a solid 9. He ruins an otherwise fantastic show.",False
9,10,Great content about penguins with a funny style!,djacker-80656,n/a,16/08/2025,"This TV show has great documentation of some penguins in Africa. It's funny because it is set up to be similar to a reality show, but since it is penguins it is really cute. The narration is great and the cameras are able to catch a lot of intense and cute moments. Highly recommend watching if you like penguins!",False
10,6,Great film footage...terrible narration.,planktonrules,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Penguin Town"" is a show worth seeing. It follows penguins throughout the year in southern Cape Town, South Africa. I've been there myself and they are truly adorable creatures.On the plus side, I am really amazed at the cinematography...it must have taken a LOT of work to get all this great footage.On the minus, the narration is often awful. I don't blame Patton Oswalt....he's just reading a script. But that script is annoying. Instead of sounding scientific, they go the opposite direction, such as referring to one penguin as 'Mrs. C', calling the penguins husband as well as wife, and trying to humanize these birds.My advice is to watch the show...and if the narration annoys you, turn off the sound and keep watching!",False
11,10,Best ever watched serial,emkaxp,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was in love watching absolutely each serie; a series that impressed me to the fullest and that allowed me to see another world of these super cute animals; I have never seen penguins in reality as I am from the Republic of Moldova, and at the moment I live in England so I discovered today that it's on Netflix so I watched all season
when I decided to watch this series I thought I would just watch penguins and ... that's about it
but in fact the whole team of this series created a true story based on the true moments of these penguins to whom they gave beautiful and funny &cute names and managed perfectly to present their lives, their relationships between them, that they can love, suffer and how hard is to raise a family and the daily fight survive on earth and in water ;
I was very impressed and you would have seen how I called my husband to watch with me, when that gang in the arcade was waiting to attack the little chicks or to eat their eggs.Absolutely gorgeous serial, I watched a lot serials on Netflix (about humans) but this one was completely different.I followed this serial with all my heart
thanks for creating this series and showing about their life and how hard is for them to survive ;
And especially thanks to people who come in that town or live there and don't kill or don't attack them; I really was impressed to see how the little penguins were passing through the house or the drivers were driving carefully ;
And need to thank that there is organisations that are watching and keep tracking pinguins life and are helping, saving them as Junior or founding eggs;
Guys so happy that I watched this serial you can't imagine.",False
12,5,Anthropomorphism,sdetlef,n/a,16/08/2025,"The dramatized narratives constructed seem very anthropomorphic. It's a penguin soap opera. Each episode ends in the worst ever ""to be continued"" drama cliff hanger. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with animal education intermixed with a heavily dramatized story lines. Will infusing these penguins with human dramatization/narration help these endangered species? Making them named celebrities isn't exactly the same thing as conservation. Feels more like exploitation. Do the penguins get royalties?I think young children would find the heavy dramatization scary. There's always penguin is going to die scenarios with scary music. Be careful with little kiddos.",False
13,8,I adore Patton Oswalt.,pfpgssx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oswalt is always a good narrator. Very informative and fun to watch, until real life rears it's ugly head. Truth is there are always predators and bad weather conditions to tend with. Many of the close calls turn out well, thankfully. I have to take a break for now. I can't handle any more potentially sad circumstances. This world has so many beautiful creatures, but life is always so hard.",False
14,10,So cute,toniaglasgow-37983,n/a,16/08/2025,I streamed all episodes in one sitting. It reminds me of meercat manor. If you liked that show you will like this.,False
15,10,Great,sd-69328,n/a,16/08/2025,Really enjoyed this. It reminded me of Meerkat Manor.,False
16,10,I am in love with Penguin Town!,savina_rey,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love the way this serie is produced, how they give character and humanized the penguins. They explain the pinguin's world like it was a real life human story, it is a must watch for the whole family. I wish they make a 2nd season with the same colony or maybe choose different animals. I learned a lot about penguins and enjoyed it a lot and wanted to aee more. I am going to miss watching it with my kids. This is a win win!",False
17,10,One of a kind!,BabeBear4,n/a,16/08/2025,This is really unlike any other documentaries I've seen before! So interesting and adorable! And Patton Oswalt's narrative really brings this show alive.,False
18,10,Joyful.,edwin-wks,n/a,16/08/2025,"Humans could learn a thing or two from the African penguins about shared parenting and gender equality. Mr B, the super dad, was inspirational. The world would be a better place if every human child received the level of dedication from their parents that Petal and Twig got. The penguin parents wanted nothing more from their offspring than for them to survive, become independent and continue the species. The giants' clever editing made for some tense moments and Oswalt's voice was the perfect accompaniment to the penguins' adorable waddle.",False
19,1,Badly researched and poorly executed.,memrskinny,n/a,16/08/2025,"Didn't even make it to the third episode. While just about enjoyable, this show should not be in the science and nature documentary category, it's misleading. I get that the show is (hopefully) not trying to be a scientific series but if the producers intend on anthropomorphising animals then it should be listed in the correct category - that being the reality tv category.The show's narrative feels forced, not very cleverly thought out and it's clear there was not a whole load of research and pre-production that went into writing this series. In fact I doubt there was any writing involved in pre-production. It just feels like a team turned up with some cameras and got whatever quick and bare minimum footage they could to assemble some sort of loose narrative.As a filmmaker and someone who wrote a dissertation on this penguin species, the unforgivable mistake and proof that the series was hastily thought out is that (as has been mentioned) the penguins' black chest spots - which are unique to each bird - keep changing between shots of the same penguins. This is a real shame as it makes the whole series fall flat in terms of trying to maintain a narrative where there clearly isn't one.",False
20,10,Sure cure for pandemic blues!,blkruse,n/a,16/08/2025,This gets my vote as cutest documentary ever. The videos plus superb narration makes for a big smile on my face all the way thru. You can't go wrong with this one.,False
21,10,Amazing show!,Trilby16,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just loved this show. Some of the time I was watching, I was also marveling over ""How did they do this?"" Capture great moments and critical moments, and follow particular ""stars"" through their mating and chick-rearing rituals.Yes, the narrator is a bit intrusive, and personally I prefer my animal shows' commentary to be delivered in a British accent, but I have to admit, his patter made LOL a few times.These penguin-people are so darn cute, waddling around a human town, having a place in it. Just amazing. Who knew?",False
22,10,"Brilliant! Love, Love, Love!!!",rthequeen,n/a,16/08/2025,Great documentary presented in a brilliantly different format and Patton did a fantastic job on Narration. Can't recommend it highly enough!,False
23,9,great for the whole family,iamjamalwhite,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great stuff. We binged it. Fell in love with the little critters. Might have to plan a trip to S Africa! By giving them names and taking you through their drama, you are invested in them. Season 2?",False
24,10,Just what we needed in 2021,salonsister,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a great feel-good show! I had no idea penguins lived in South Africa. I appreciate how the locals allow for the penguins to have free reign. One home even keeps its doors open for the penguins to travel through. Even the visitors look like they follow all the signs to keep their distance. The penguins even have their own ""sidewalks"" and ""crosswalks"". Patton Oswald is the perfect narrator. He added the perfect amount of comedy. I was really rooting for these adorable endangered penguins.This show could not have come at a better time. During the pandemic, I needed laughter and that feeling of connection and this show delivered. Fingers crossed for a season two!",False
25,8,"Seriously, narrators should have a mellifluous voice.",wineesa-89354,n/a,16/08/2025,I love penguins. I learned a lot I didn't already know with this series. I want to go to this town. It would have been better if the narrator had a better voice.,False

1,10,Completely changed my understanding (BA-Econ & MBA),charlesrwhiteman,n/a,15/08/2025,"I consider(ed) myself to be a very knowledgeable about macro economics. This movie completely altered my understanding. I highly recommend. Taxation and government spending is obviously a subject that sparks a lot of political and ideological debate, but the film-maker exposes the hipocracy and misunderstanding that politicians of all ideologies share. I wish the movie was available by streaming it directly online. I would pay to see it again. I'd even give it away to friends for Christmas if it were possible to do so. Please try to increase the distribution of this really important information.",False
2,10,The Power to Transform,unended,n/a,15/08/2025,"Finding the Money has the potential to completely upend the way you understand not only the economy but society as a whole. Few films, documentary or otherwise, can lay claim to that kind of impact upon the viewer. When the material presented is understood, suddenly everybody talking about govt policy-especially but not limited to fiscal policies like taxing and spending-starts to sound crazy. It's because they don't know what you now know. Or in some cases are pretending not to know it.The myths that are propagated about the monetary system and the constraints it operates under are not accidents, but redound to the benefit of a power structure-a ruling class-that prefers the highly inegalitarian status quo. Economic inequality is not just an outcome of their preferred fiscal policies, but the very source of their political power. Understanding the power of fiat currency-and that money is not property belonging to individuals but a public utility-is essential to restoring egalitarianism and reclaiming democratic governance.",False
3,10,Important and timely,iantowler-02931,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fantastic documentary. Explaining what money is and how the monetary system works. Pulling the veil back on many damaging misconceptions and misunderstandings which lead to terrible policy choices and terrible outcomes. Important and timely. Paradigm challenging, which will make many watching uncomfortable as it will go against everything they've ever heard and what they believe to be true intuitively, because it's what everyone says, it's what politicians say, what many economists say, and what many journalists and media say. But once you see it and it clicks, you can't unsee it. We can't solve the biggest challenges we face unless we understand the basics and how things actually work.",False
4,10,A New Economics 101,robdorihudson,n/a,15/08/2025,"Kelton's book, The Deficit Myth, and this film clearly demonstrate that mainstream, orthodox economics doesn't tell us that the U. S. federal government does not need to tax in order to have money to spend. Taxes have other useful purposes in controlling inflation and bringing stability and balance to the economy. Mainstream economists and economics professors need to reframe how they explain and teach the fundamentals of money and government finance. This film is eye-opening. A must watch for anyone interested in understanding how much more our government can do to make life better for everyone.",False
5,10,A turning point in economic and public spending debates,loftus-29461,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of those films that sticks with you. We have all been brought up to believe a certain narrative about money, that it's like a scarce commodity or that it can only come from employers, banks, or taxation and borrowing. And, we all know the federal government can create money, but we're conditioned to believe it shouldn't unless it has to.This doc takes all those assumptions and blows them up in your face. By demonstrating to the audience how a country's currency is simply a public tool that we have collective say in how to use, the film opens up new areas of debate in how public spending can and should be conducted.Regardless of your political views, this film has something for you. Whether you hate the idea of taxes and inflation, or love the idea of ending climate change and inequality, you are doing yourself a favor by hearing the arguments laid out in this film. You will understand that we can afford to build any kind of world we want to build as long as we respect and understand the limits and flows of real resources in our economy.",False
6,10,Mandatory Watch - Paradigm Shifting,shawnriegsecker-52596,n/a,15/08/2025,"First, ignore the critical reviews who don't want you to watch this film. They're akin to oil and coal lobbyists trying to gaslight us, and keep us from understanding the true origins, nature, and mechanics of money.This film is 90 mins, but the conversations you'll have post watching this film with others is limitless--you'll be discussing these economic principles (not concepts) for the rest of your life educating others. Hyperbole? Sure, but not by much. It's my small motivator conferring the thought ""Trust me. You want to, and need to, see this film.""This film is a 10/10 for what it is and it's intended purpose. View this film as an introductory ""101"" course. It serves this purpose well. For those familiar with MMT, it may feel a bit too shallow, but that is by design. It's wonky enough to engage economists but not overly wonky, dull, or dry.My gut believes this is most likely the first of what will become a series of documentaries with each new release going deeper and building on the knowledge and education of this introductory film.Shawn.",False
7,1,Boring redundant hyperbole,fdsafdsafd,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stephanie Kelton is a fool and a fraud. Once again Netflix produces a lemon""Finding the Money"" promises a revolutionary understanding of economics,but instead delivers a one-sided infomercial for a controversial theory. The documentary relies on charisma, not critical analysis, to peddle Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) as the answer to all our financial woes.Step Right Up, Folks, It's Snake Oil Economics!The film hinges on Professor Stephanie Kelton's enthusiastic lectures. Kelton comes across as passionate, but passion doesn't equal peer-reviewed fact. MMT's core tenet - that governments can simply print money without consequence - is a recipe for economic disaster in the hands of most. The documentary ignores historical examples of hyperinflation caused by reckless money printing.Where's the Beef? (Besides Kelton)MMT is presented as a complete economic theory, but dissenting voices are scarce. The film cherry-picks interviews with a small group of MMT proponents, creating an echo chamber effect. Where's the debate? Where are the mainstream economists who find MMT wanting?Pretty Pictures Don't Pay the BillsThe documentary uses flashy graphics to illustrate complex economic concepts. Unfortunately, these visuals can't mask the film's lack of depth. Serious discussions about inflation, interest rates, and currency valuation are left unexplored.Finding the Money? More Like Losing Your Time""Finding the Money"" might appeal to those seeking a quick economic fix, but for anyone looking for a balanced and nuanced understanding of our financial system, this documentary is a waste of time. Skip the propaganda and head to your local library for some real economic education.",False
8,1,Socialists & Climate agenda fanatics pretending to be Economists,evgeny-zislis,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stephanie Kelton and friends are presenting their radical Modern-Monetary-Theory (MMT) idea as the panacea to all of humanity problems. The main concept of MMT is that government can spend on whatever it feels like. At the end of the day, it is the bureaucrats in the government who get to decide where every citizen's toil and sweat should be channeled into. Should the government decide that Bill Gates needs to get all of your money, and he shouldn't have any competitors, they are wholly free to do so, and they are doing it. There is apparently no constraint or anything that can stop the government from choosing what is best for YOU.The only thing that is supposedly ""easy to calculate"" and can stop the rampant spending by government is the risk of inflation. Kelton doesn't even try to explain what Inflation is, or how it is created, she just mentioned that it is important and easy to math out. So the government creating dollars and spending them into the economy in the trillions has nothing to do with inflation. As long as there are enough poor people who can use these dollars to spend like drunken sailors and keep the economy out of a depression.If you ever had any interest in economy, and you read some significant books by influential economists in history, you might want to call 911 because this ""documentary"" is going to give you a heart attack.The bureaucrats in the USSR would be really envious to have some of this MMT drug to explain away their perfect economic system.",False

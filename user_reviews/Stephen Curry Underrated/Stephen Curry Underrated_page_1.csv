1,8,Stories weren't tell,wjw0970,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are so much more materials that they have missed. The ""0"", the ""no one wants to see us next year"". ""Ayesha Curry can cook"". These kids are shooting half court three pointers nowadays. The movie missed all of these. Not to mention that guys like me, 43 years old man, come back to watch NBA just because of him. (I stopped watching NBA in my early twenties).I thought I would have known all the stories about him, but still saw some new clips while watching this documentary. It satisfies me. What surprised me was somehow they managed to mix the clips between 2008 and 2023 in the end, plus the music, that was a win for a documentary. Good job on that.Overall it's a fine documentary to watch as a Curry fan. I'm expecting more, but I'm satisfied. Looking forward anther one after his retirement.",True
2,7,Understated is what this documentary is,xWRL,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stephen Curry, one of the most accomplished, exciting athletes of our era, deserves better than this uninspired hagiography that just rehashes major events in his life. If you didn't already know, you would not learn from this film that he's one of our most articulate sports figures, one of our wisest, one of our most generous and charitable to causes including ones he's a prime mover for, and one of the most effective advocates of family and community values.It's all done attractively, and the video clips from the earlier stages of Curry's life add something new, but the film pales next to the real Stephen Curry.",False
3,7,"Great view of Curry, but wish it had been more complete",gbill-74877,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great coverage of Steph Curry's early years and time at Davidson, where in his sophomore year the team won three straight upsets to make the Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament before losing to #1 Kansas by just two points. I loved seeing the old footage of the baby-faced assassin, and getting his and others' comments about these years.Unfortunately, the documentary is ridiculously scant from there, skipping his junior year at Davidson altogether, and flipping through his years as a pro in just minutes. Seriously, I think the footage of his Subway commercial or him sitting in front of his computer working on his thesis to complete his degree later in life got more time. It was remarkably abrupt and aside from the disappointment I felt over that, missed the titular aspect of Curry's career: even in the NBA he has always been underrated, and still is to a degree underrated, even after all his success.So much is left out here. We see Reggie Miller make an appearance at the beginning to read an NBA scouting report on Curry, then disappear. We don't see interviews with his teammates on the Warriors or coach Steve Kerr. We don't see how Curry's shot selection was viewed as shocking, but would come to quite literally change the NBA. We don't see anyone comment on his extraordinary off-ball movement, gravity on the court, and deep sense of selflessness, always making his teammates better, or how it compares to other superstars. Aside from rushed highlights mainly of the fourth championship run, we get very little of the big playoff moments, much less Curry's other exploits (402 threes in a season, unanimous MVP, etc). It was quite a letdown. I look forward to someone making a proper documentary about Curry and the Warriors dynasty years when his playing days are over.",False
4,7,"Inspirational, years after his story will make such a great biography movie.",khalidmoubile,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stephen Curry: Underrated.The coming-of-age story of Stephen Curry, from an undersized basketball player at a small college, to becoming a larger-than-life NBA superstar.First of all, I don't follow much the NBA but who doesn't know this guy that I found the most pleasing player to watch playing basketball and the accuracy he has in his hands is just unbelievable.The guy with the most three pointers of all time, the skinny short guy who believed in himself and in what he can brings, his story is inspirational and it shows that people standards aren't always the right ones and you can break some laws if you're brave enough .Getting through Curry's professional life and personal life was great, I know him better now, what a player and what a person !Mixing between his past and 2022 was a very smart trick thought.",False
5,9,Docucation? Based on a true story?,omar-longus-571-655530,n/a,16/08/2025,"Super interesting take on Steph and a great story to share with kids. Steph and the team did an amazing job of boiling down everything he's done into a tight narrative. I'd frame it as more of the children's book than the novel of the things he's done. It shows Steph as a person who plays basketball as opposed to a generational talent, and really seems to target core values he cares about and highlight the process and people that have made his career so incredible.Some cool editing, new angles of the Davidson tourney run, and has a clear vision of what it's trying to do. For basketball fans you're not getting the Survive & Advance version of the tourney run or The Last Dance version of Steph as a competitor, but you do get glimpses in addition to Steph as a kid, a son, a student, a husband, a dad, and a teammate. It's also interesting because it's kind of a modern day throw back to the Come Fly With Me type of NBA superstar docs with a little more focus on showcasing the man rather than the athlete.",False
6,7,Loved it!,moontails-49476,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who doesn't follow the NBA that regularly, this was a great introduction to one of the legends of our times. Absolutely loved learning more about Stephen Curry's journey. Nicely done!They probably could have made a season out of it, but the short and sweet nature of it has its own charm. What legends - both player and coach! One to see the potential and the other to live up to it. Take a bow, both of you!Always a treat to watch such well made sports documentaries, the hero's journey and the struggles they overcome is nothing new, yet incredibly beautiful in every athlete's odyssey!",False
7,10,Fantastic underdog story that highlights how exceptional it is that Steph Curry has achieved so much..,warriorssmith,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerStephen Curry's Underrated is a fantastic underdog story that highlights how exceptional it is that Steph Curry has achieved so much in the NBA. This is an origin story of the greatest player under 6'6 in NBA history. A man with a heart of gold who manages not to throw any shots or low blows at anyone at all. Something very rare in todays media. A very classy display.This documentary mainly focuses on his time in High School and College. You also get an exclusive view of his life off the court. There isn't a lot of focus on his time on the court in the NBA but I am sure we will see more of that once he retires. The fact he had to overcome so many obstacles at his height and weight should be inspirational to all aspiring basketball players who are of a smaller stature. Look at Curry man so inspirational.One of the things I really appreciated was seeing his 1st year in college and the relationships he developed with his teammates and classmates at Davidson. Davidson and his 1st year of college were relatively unknown because YouTube wasn't as big and their games were rarely shown on TV. You had to be there in person to see these games. Curry still impresses as a role model after watching this documentary. I give underrated a 10/10.,True
8,7,A splash for Basketball Fans,Entertainmentsparadise,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary showcases Stephen Curry's incredible journey to becoming the greatest shooter of all time! From his college days battling during March Madness , which gave me goosebumps, to his trials in the NBA, it's captivating.The focus on determination, proving the naysayers wrong and pushing through setbacks, especially with Curry completing his bachelor's, was inspiring. Bring back NCAA college hoops games!The only downside for me was the sense that something was lacking, and the ending seemed rushed. Not much focus on Curry holistically (including family) but I guess you can't have it all.Overall, a solid watch, earning 3.5/5 stars!",False
9,7,Sharp-Shooting Stephen Curry on the Small Screen!!,mjpiro,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerStephen Curry: Underrated is the complete story of the life of one Stephen Curry all the way from his very early years growing up to his latest championship with the Golden State Warriors at the end of the 2021-2022 NBA season. It is told in a documentary style that goes back and fourth from his early adolescent years with his family to his rise to national attention at Davidson University in North Carolina, finally to his most recent success with the Warriors in the NBA. While the documentary does good a job of covering all of Curry's life with interviews from some influential members of his family including dad and former NBA player Dell, mom Sonya, and grandmother Candy Adams it also includes takes from friends and former NBA star Reggie Miller, and current NBA stars Kevin Durant and Draymond Green. The documentary finally features many interviews from Davidson head coach Bob McKillop, a very influential figure throughout Steph's life. The documentary is organized really well and the picture quality for non-archived footage is top notch! The creative team that put this work together was even able to clean up over ten year old footage of Steph Curry and Davidson games in 2007 very well and clear to see for this documentary so kudos to them on their work on this part of the documentary. While this piece covers the entire court about Steph's success in life it mainly focuses on his success and struggles he had at Davidson university, the academic institution that really put Curry on the map and helped him start his game-changing NBA career by making the three-point shot ""the thing."" The Curry documentary ends on a nice note by coming full circle with Steph coming back to Davidson years after leaving school one year early to depart for the draft to receive his diploma by returning to school for the special ceremony. He also had his number retired on that same night at Davidson, a school that only retires numbers of athletes if they graduate. Peter Nicks did a nice job directing this documentary, it was organized and interesting throughout. Nathan Matthew David did a fine job with the soundtrack to the documentary, it nicely complimented the flow of the footage and was not overwhelming. Stephen Curry: Underrated is rated PG-13 this year the year it was released in 2023 and runs one hour and fifty minutes. If you like basketball, rooting for the little guy, Davidson University, Steph Curry, or the Golden State Warriors then this is the documentary for you. 7 out of 10 stars.",True
10,10,A Real Life David and Goliath Story,elissewright,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a profession where size matters, professional basketball, Stephen Curry, continually overlooked and discounted because of his appearance, has completed confounded expectations. This moving and inspirational documentary is truly a David and Goliath story for anyone who has been counted out because they don't ""look the part."" It shows how someone who has been written off time and time again, rewrote not only the NBA record books, but his professional life story through belief, persistence, and hard work. Even for those of us familiar with his story, the film provides touching moments that remind us of how special (one of his favorite words) his journey truly is.",False
11,6,A good career recap,barker-18256,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very surface level documentary, it's a great in depth recap of his career, but the majority focuses on his college run without adding much that you couldn't just watch the highlights on YouTube. The documentary would have been better if it just focused on the warriors last championship, and followed him throughout that year. The story wrote itself a team that missed the playoffs one of the best players of all time having his greatness doubted. Unfortunately they decided to recap the career of player that is still active doesn't have the magic of the last dance as curry's story is yet to be finished.",False
12,5,Just not that good,evandronius,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Steph curry as much as the next fan, and his story really is amazing, but this just felt like a lot was missing. I can't explain exactly what it was but it just wasn't up to par with similar sports bios. Maybe they needed to do like a three part series and have it be more extensive, 30 for 30 style (for example the great bill walton doc).It also just felt weird stylistically. Like a lot of shooting of random daily tasks that were entirely uninteresting. They brought in Reggie Miller st the literal very beginning like he was going to be have a big role, and then you didn't see him once the rest of the time. Also a lot of interviews from mostly people from the Davidson days, which, fine but then just make it a doc about his Davidson days and not try to tie in the quest for his fourth ring which was an equally interesting story that deserves its own episode.Like they really should have done an episode on his past, his upbringing, interviews from all his family, high school days with the high school coach and then transition to the Davidson saga with all those characters and that drama, and then a third episode about his pro days. You could've stuck to the underrated theme the whole time and it would've felt so much more complete and worthy.",False
13,7,Interesting documentary,jared-25331,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stephen Curry: Underrated (2023) is a documentary movie about the famous basketball player and his rise to superstardom.Positives for Stephen Curry: Underrated (2023):
It was interesting for me watch and learn about Stephen Curry and his rise to fame. I was intrigued by this man and his journey to being the man he is today. I liked listening to all the people who know Curry and how they describe him was great. And finally, I do love me some good underdog stories.Negatives for Stephen Curry: Underrated (2023):
I'm not a avid fan of basketball, so what they were talking about weren't interesting. I use to play it as a kid, but I have no interest in it as an adult. And finally, this is one of those documentaries where my first experience will definitely be my last.Overall, Stephen Curry: Underrated (2023) is a good documentary movie about the famed Basketball player and while I don't care about the sport, I have nothing but respect for this man and what he does.",False
14,10,A must see,mariesa-99570,n/a,16/08/2025,"A doc on Steph could easily be 3 hours but I loved the masterful way they weaved in his earlier years and the sheer dominance he's had in the NBA. While he's constantly being disrespected and under appreciated by the fan bases of those he's consistently beaten this was a beautiful glimpse of how an undersized kid became one of the greatest to ever play the game. A triumphant story of resilience, the joys of victory and the sheer agony of defeat. Even if you aren't a fan of basketball you will leave being inspired. Steph is one of one. His impact on the game will be felt for generations to come. Truly special.",False
15,6,Feel Good But Definitely Not Underrated,KinoBuff2021,n/a,16/08/2025,"'Stephen Curry: Underrated' (2023) is fine. Its a slightly above average sports documentary, but its is gonna be underrated like Steph has been throughout his career.Stephen Curry is one of my favorite active players today, but as sweet and sincere this documentary is I don't think it lives up to the tremendous legacy Steph is still building upon.This film focuses on the aspect that so many people underestimate Steph him proving himself time and time again. It becomes more than basketball in this film, as Steph finally finishes his degree from Davidson and shows how his family (blood-related and ball-related) shape who he is today.This film might be a little premature as Steph's influence in basketball continues to change the way the game is played. But it is still good, and will make you cry tears of joy along with the inspiration to shoot your shot even it feels like no believes in you.",False
16,8,Fun but could be better,gxtdghjgx,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie is not for a hard core fans of the Athlete most of the stuff shown is something most fans already know only thing added is the thought process behind it it's mostly for people that want to get to know him more or athletes that can use the knowledge for their own practice and career some parts were interesting and fun and some felt unnecessary for a movie that supposed to show him as underrated it definitely did in some parts but it could have add more if u are a fan then u will have some fun watching a compilation of his career if u are new then u learn a lot great job in terms of music and quality and amazing job putting it together 8/10.,False
17,6,it's having a team of partners that gives you superpowers,noshouse,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether or not you've watched basketball or have an interest in it, I'd like to recommend this documentary. Basketball has always been a sport that places a heavy emphasis on height and physique since its inception. Over the years, basketball prodigies and legendary players have predominantly been those with a height of 190cm (6'3"") or taller, and they typically fit the muscular, 'macho man' stereotype. What makes Curry so unique is that, unlike Iverson, he doesn't have that wild, heavily tattooed look.There have been countless videos and documentaries over the years highlighting Curry's incredible dedication and strength. As a devoted fan of Curry myself, I've watched quite a few. However, this documentary truly allowed me to deeply understand that Curry discovered that while opportunities might help you harness your abilities, it's having a team of partners that grants you superpowers.",False
18,10,A look back in time.,angelomirang,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was expecting a little more about his NBA career in this documentary. But it all makes sense that this film was made with the word ""underrated"" in mind. It's great to see how someone who was deemed to be irrelevant on the court became one of the most influential and most loved athlete in the world. This film shows what life really looks like when you're not winning and the things someone has to go through to overcome that, hence the title ""Underrated"". Great film!One day, we will see another documentary about this dude and it's gonna be another masterpiece. I have been a big fan of him since day one and I appreciate him even more after watching this docu.",False
19,9,I was disappointed...but....,bmiller59,n/a,16/08/2025,"First things first, I am a HUGE Golden State Warriors fan and have been since the 70's. I have seen many incredible players come and go for The Warriors as well as The NBA. Stephen Curry is arguably the greatest basketball I have ever seen. Every season I ask myself and my Warriors friends how did we get so lucky to have him on our team representing the Bay Area? Much like Joe Montana, Willie Mays, Buster Posey, Steph has captured the attention of The Bay Area sports fans.I absolutely loved this movie, don't get me wrong. His exploits on the basketball court from high school, through college, and with the Warriors left my bottom jaw open. I only know Steph since he was signed by The Warriors. I've never seen replays of him prior to The Warriors but his path to The NBA were what we see on a nightly basis and my bottom jaw drops open. When we see something extraordinary from Steph on the basketball and then we see another extraordinary feat, we think we've seen it all.I was disappointed in the Underrated title and how it applied to this movie. He got passed over in his quest to go to the college that his dad did. He was good, but... He worked hard at his craft to be the player that he is. Remember he was the first and only unanimous voted MVP. He works hard, at everything. He just won the Tahoe Edgewood celebrity golf tournament, the first active athlete in a sport to win it, and he has many other obligations that take up his time, and he practiced enough to win...with a hole-in-one.I don't know what I wanted or expected from this in relationship with its title, but I absolutely loved Underrated.",False
20,3,Felt.. very unnecessary,grant_westbrook,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stephen Curry is my favorite athlete of all time and plays for my hometown team, and I think he is at worst a top-10 player in NBA history. I still don't know why this documentary was made.Nothing new outside of a few never-before-seen clips of him in high school/at college was revealed to us. No exciting quotes, no truly encapsulating behind the scenes clips/interviews/soundbites, sparsely invoked sidebar comments from Steph that really don't add anything new or insightful.Anyone even tangentially knowledgeable about Steph is likely already aware of his magnificent run at Davidson in 2008, so the fact that this documentary spends roughly an hour and forty minutes covering it all while saying nothing of note is.. disappointing as a massive Steph fan. I could have simply watched the 10 minute YouTube video of Steph's 2008 March Madness highlights followed by another 10 minute video of 2022 Finals Game 4 highlights and walked away virtually just as knowledgeable.This is just the first major venture into the media world for Steph & Co, so I'm not really worried, (that Warriors Dynasty documentary in a decade or so is going to HIT) but I expected better to be completely honest, I walked away from this rather underwhelmed.",False
21,10,there is more here...,donyelbyronjr,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film about Stephen Curry is a captivating portrayal of his journey. It effectively showcases his coachability, which is a key aspect of his success. The title of the film accurately captures the essence of Curry's story. However, it's important to recognize that he is more than just a basketball player. He is someone who prioritizes bringing joy to his fans through his actions. The director skillfully portrays Curry as someone who carefully evaluates criticisms, both in terms of his athletic abilities and his ideas, without explicitly stating it. Instead of focusing solely on Curry's ideals, the documentary could have explored the perspectives of those he interacts with, shedding light on his character. By doing so, the film would have captured a more comprehensive picture of his personality. ""Underrated"" provides valuable insights into his profession while also highlighting the essence of Stephen Curry as a person, doing justice to his athletic profile. From a personal standpoint, I believe that controversy is inherent in professional sports. However, for those who appreciate thought-provoking ideas, this documentary intermittently reveals the true story of Stephen Curry. If you have a passion for basketball, Stephen Curry, or the Golden State Warriors, this documentary is a must-watch. Additionally, Davidson College, as an institution of higher learning, plays a significant role in Curry's journey, and the Golden State Warriors have capitalized on this connection. ""Underrated"" appeals not only to basketball enthusiasts but also to individuals who strive to pursue multiple passions simultaneously. This story revolves around what Stephen Curry represents in the world of basketball. The film not only showcases his skills on the court but also highlights his ability to think critically and innovate. Personally, I would be thrilled to see the rest of Stephen Curry's story unfold in a documentary that further supports his thesis. I would also like to introduce his story to individuals who have been pulled in different directions due to various factors or their diverse interests. I believe the film has the potential to be longer or even span multiple volumes, as basketball is a sport played by a man with a multitude of ideas. I apologize if my words unintentionally offend anyone who holds basketball dear.",False
22,8,Missing a little something but a great watch,NS-reviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a huge Steph Curry fan, I was really excited for this to come out. For the most part, it did not disappoint.The style and aesthetic of this documentary was really pleasing, a nice mix of early 2000's footage and modern day polished, crisp filmography. It was fun to have it flip back and forth, especially the editing between the Davidson games and the 2022 NBA Playoffs/Finals games.I liked how much or this story and the content centered around Curry's time at Davidson. While I enjoy watching both, I am a bigger college basketball fan than NBA. Seeing the clips made me antsy for March Madness in July. It was great to hear from other teammates, Coach McKillop, and to see clips from Steph's time in college.It also integrated a nice takeaway message regarding education and perseverance which was admirable. Some proud, emotional moments that once again relate back to his collegiate career.I wanted to see a little bit more pertaining to his training, his workout routine, his practicing. He has made such a physical transformation that I'd hoped to unpack that, as well as what it takes to rehab those repetitive injuries he's suffered. It's mentioned, touched on, flashed through, but I thought it was some meat to the story of Steph that was missing, keeping this doc from being extremely good.",False
23,8,Incredibly Motivating,hardestheartedharlot,n/a,16/08/2025,"I must say, this documentary is a job very well done. It gives us great insight into who Stephen is. We get to see his games as a boy, teen and man. We see his support network, parents, coaches, school friends and teammates. We begin to understand why he's so humble, and we see how loved and respected he is at Davidson. I often found myself grinning and punching the air. It's feel-good on steroids. As for the edit, that too is great work. There are no drawn-out monologues. They keep the dialogue short and snappy, which gives the whole thing breathing space. Even if you're not a sports fan you'll enjoy this.",False
24,8,Just didn't know,elisavbizau,n/a,16/08/2025,"Have admired Curry for this ability to shoot 3 pointers, apparently, without a miss. I always thought he had a more generic background, but I never knew that he was this short and that everyone overlooked him as he was on the come up.Loved the pacing of the movie and how it was cut between the present and the past. I think they did an amazing job portraying the feeling of what they have felt back then and how Curry feels now in the present.Loved the movie front to back and I feel it has woken inside of me a joy I did not have before for basketball.Another thing I really admire which we do not have in Romania towards basketball (or any other sport in High School and College) is just how united is the community in the city and how supportive everyone is of the players. Really inspiring.",False
25,10,Truly special,legendsbk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stephen Curry's Underrated documentary truly exceeded my expectations. It's an incredible deep dive into the life and career of the NBA legend. I was struck by his resilience and the obstacles he overcame to become one of the greatest shooters in the game. The interviews and behind-the-scenes moments add a personal touch that's simply inspiring. Congratulations to Stephen Curry on his incredible career and numerous achievements in the world of basketball! His dedication and skill have made him a true legend in the sport. From his three-point prowess to his leadership on and off the court, Stephen Curry's impact on basketball is truly remarkable.",False

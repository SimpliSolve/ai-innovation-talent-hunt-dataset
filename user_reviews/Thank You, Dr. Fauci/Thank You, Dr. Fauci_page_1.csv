1,9,Must see for our generation,ZacharyRevel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction, which is the case here.I wholeheartedly recommend this documentary. The directors touch on one of the greatest grifts of my generation, and it may change the way you view society and conspiracy theories altogether.The COVID situation was a unique look into how the powers of today would handle a catastrophe, but this documentary shows the inner workings behind those who would use policy to control others.During the pandemic, many 'facts' were told to the people to accept as true, policies, and rules of law were implemented without restriction due to this new emergency state of society.Every generation has it's lies told to them by it's government. Documentaries like Supersize me, An inconvenient truth were so popular because they plainly spoke a truth that no one really uncovered before that and this documentary follows suit.An independent work, and worth your time and money.",False
2,10,Excellent.,alexanderhcwear,n/a,16/08/2025,"TCN has surprised me with the quality of its content, and Thank You, Dr Fauci is no exception. Very well done, in depth research, that is compiled in a fashion that really underscores the sense of seriousness that scientific collusion has. Really important film, along with Line in the Sand. Bravo, TCN. I'm convinced the reason that the film isn't averaging 9+ stars is due a disagreement with the political content. It's a 10. Very damning and although it seems a little tinfoil-hat-esque, so many intertwined coincidences very seldom are a coincidence. It has made me rethink a lot about other pandemics such as Ebola and HIV/AIDS, and brings into question just how deep the Pharamaceutical companies' hands are into the pockets of Washington DC.",False
3,3,A colossal anti-climax.,shieldspt,n/a,16/08/2025,"After listening to Tucker Carlson's interview with director Jenner Furst, I was intrigued enough to subscribe to the Tucker Carlson Network solely to watch the documentary. If you've also heard the interview, save yourself the trouble-I made the mistake so you don't have to!Tucker's interview not only covered everything the documentary attempted to, but did so with greater depth, clarity, and context.Given the title, you'd expect the documentary's principal focus to be Dr. Fauci. Instead, the bulk of the screen time-by a significant margin-was devoted to Jenner Furst himself. Approximately 20% (if not more) of the runtime consists of Furst earnestly typing at his laptop, earnestly speaking into his phone, or earnestly chatting with two producer friends. Why their opinions are supposed to matter is never explained.The scientists, researchers, insiders, and whistleblowers whose testimonies I was eager to hear were relegated to brief, contextless soundbites and bullet points. Rather than presenting substantive prima facie evidence, the film leans heavily on unsubstantiated assertions.To make matters worse, the first 10 minutes felt like an extended trailer. I had anticipated a forensic, in-depth investigation-something that treated the audience as adults. Instead, I got what can only be described as ""cappuccino journalism"": 20% content, 80% froth. Even the limited substance offered was unsatisfying and left me wanting far more.Documentaries intended for adult audiences were once expected to engage with complex ideas and expansive vocabulary. Now it seems that dropping a few F-bombs is supposed to pass for sophistication-a weak attempt to mask the lack of real substance.If you've already listened to Tucker's interview, there's no need to watch the documentary-it will only disappoint. And if you haven't heard the interview yet, skip the film altogether and invest the time reading primary sources or more thorough investigative jounalistic articles.",False
4,3,Way too much rambling,emagnuson-47455,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was mostly the director sitting at his computer while narrating rambling thoughts on everything from the Lab Leak, 9/11, AIDS, etc., many of which are spurious and only serve to discredit the arguments presented that do have a factual basis. The most convincing evidence for the Lab Leak theory get lost in the sea of dubious claims and speculation. Instead of slowing down and making a solid case for the lab leak theory (or why gain of function research is too risky), we get a few bullet points for each idea before he's moved on to the next one. The 3 stars are mostly for the former director of the CDC Robert Redfield and investigative journalist Emily Kopp, who were interviewed extensively in this documentary.If you are curious about the lab leak theory and want some convincing evidence, I'd recommend the book Viral by Matt Ridley and Alina Chan, reporting by Emily Kopp at US Right To Know (who is featured in the documentary in snippets, but neglects her most significant contributions), or the SoHo Forum debate ""Did Covid Start in a Lab?"", which can be found on YouTube or the audio as a podcast.",False
5,3,A touchy subject for sure.,toonarly,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie tells all about what happened during the 2020, but a lot is missing, you can easily find that out by researching on your own especially with persons involved like Robert Malone and Peter McCullough who were dead center in this with valid arguments that contradicted Fauci. Watch this with a huge grain of salt as it may seem like a good documentary on the activities of Fauci, but, he still did a lot of very questionable activities that still must be investigated further for sure hopefully soon, he may go down in history as what a lot of people hope to hear, and justice prevails, but the facts will eventually come to light. Enjoy by doing your own due diligence research also, do not just believe everything they say.",False

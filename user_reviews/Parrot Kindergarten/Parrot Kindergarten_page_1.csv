1,10,The most moving and insightful documentary.,sparklyzebracandy,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was pulling at the heart string from the first few minutes. Seeing Jen's journey, meeting the birds through the screen and seeing their successes felt so real. This is a must watch for anyone interested in animal behaviour, for pet owners, and for scientists.This documentary shows that we can all do better for the animals in our world, and we can start by taking one step at a time. It presses that animals are our companions, not decor, and their feelings and wellbeing are so very important.Have tissues ready, you will need them. This is such a beautiful documentary that I hope touches the hearts of every viewer.",False
2,10,Informative and moving!,TerriR-46,n/a,15/08/2025,"All of the emotions...this movie removes all doubt in my mind, scientifically, (if there were any left at this point) that we can communicate across species. Such an amazing story told here, with some of Jennifer's life and why she is so passionate about giving a voice to all beings. And then the science, so much of her research, and obvious love for all animals, especially Ellie. My whole family enjoyed it, including our parrot who knows firsthand what these communication methods can do. Thank you for a movie that left me feeling good, and hopeful - if you are an animal advocate of any kind, this movie is for you!.",False
3,10,A MUST SEE!,TariV-8,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWe all share this beautiful planet with animals, and this film helps us to realize that animals are sentient beings, just like us, and should be treated with utmost respect, especially when in our care.Parrots, in particular, have the capacity to communicate much more than was ever thought possible. They have the capacity to do much more than mimic sounds that humans make. Thanks to groundbreaking research by Jen Taylor-O'Connor and her sidekick, Ellie, along with their team of scientific experts, we can begin to see just what animals, not just parrots, are capable of sharing with us. In turn, it places upon us a greater responsibility when it comes to providing a suitable environment and appropriate enrichment for animals in our care.More than just science, this film is a story about trauma and the powerful healing connection between humans and animals when we act from the heart space. We really need each other. Watch this film and be changed.",True
4,10,A profound look at the minds of companion birds and the woman who listens,ListenK,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been following Jen and her birds for about 9 years now and I remember the exact sentiment I had after watching and reading some of the content after first finding the modest FB page: ""There are going to be textbooks detailing her and the birds one day."" Almost a decade later and she's well on her way to that very sentiment.This film isn't just about birds doing tricks. It's about agency, emotion, and the undeniable intelligence of animals we so often underestimate. Jen's deep connection with her birds, especially Ellie, is the beating heart of the story. The documentary highlights not just what these birds can do, and what they have to say, but what animals are capable of once given a voice, and that distinction is powerful.Her work is as much about respect for animals as it is about communication, and it's impossible to come away from this film unchanged. Whether you're an animal lover, a behavior science enthusiast, or just someone who believes in listening more closely-this documentary is essential viewing.",False
5,10,Moved to tears,BCCHICK-4,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was gifted Jens parrot kindergarten program and was able to connect with my birds teaching them the tablet games and enriching their lives further.I was quickly added to the amazing collection of people within the program, you only needed to ask them the authenticity of Jen and her work.I was aware of some of Jens personal struggles but seeing them in colour before our eyes moved both myself and husband to tears, for her loss and the journey it took to find peace again. I'm so glad this film was made to show the world, they are not just a pet to be admired in a cage. Well done Ellie xx.x.",False
6,10,Beautiful and moving film,CJB100,n/a,15/08/2025,"This beautiful and moving film will change not only the way you view parrots and other birds, but how you view all animals on the planet. Jen is an amazing force or nature and captivating to watch at every turn. Her relationship with Ellie is so profound and touching, we should all be as kind, intelligent and gentle when interacting with other living beings. The film will make you laugh and cry, it will make you lose faith in humanity and redeem your faith in humanity through Jen's thoughtful and unique gaze. We all want to know what challenge Jen will take on next! She is an inspiration to use all!",False
7,10,Beautiful Film,KarenW-757,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love this film! How can we do better for our pets? Can they tell us what they need? Can they tell us what they feel? What kind of evidence is needed before science accepts that we can communicate across species? Can a bird help heal our trauma? Can we help heal theirs?This beautiful film addresses all these questions. I love the work Jen is doing with her birds and other animals. It is groundbreaking, fascinating and it touches an emotional chord that I didn't expect. If you love animals you already have a big heart. Watching this film will make it even bigger and it will make you a better pet parent.",False
8,10,What does your pet think?,imdbfan-596047,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHave you ever wondered what your pet was thinking? Wondered if they were sick, hungry or wanted to go out? Of course, we all have. This is an amazing story about love, loss and learning. Learning to love again after years of heartbreak. Learning to understand. And well for little Ellie, just plain learning!We all know how smart a crow can be or that an African Grey can speak and mimic a multitude of sounds. But did you know all parrots can learn numbers? Can play games? Can video chat with their friends??? Oh and they can also READ!Jennifer Taylor O'Conner and her beautiful girls Ellie, Isabelle and Tillie have shown the world just the tip of the iceberg of what these amazing little creatures are capable of learning. Ellie is showing the world that animal cognitive research should have never stopped. So much time was lost!! We are so very lucky to live in a time such as this where someone else picked up and went where others never dreamed to go!From loss comes great love. And I'm so very glad that Ellie made her way to Jen. Some things are meant to be. And I'm even more honored she shared this story with all of us.Enjoy every minute. You will laugh. You will cry. But most importantly you will be amazed.",True
9,10,Amazing Documentary,AlisanB-7,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you love animals, you need to see this film! If you have an animal companion (parrot, dog, horse, fish, duck?!), you will be motivated to have real conversations.As a child, I remember hearing about Koko learning sign language. It was so heartbreaking to find out what happened to the field between then and now.Although Jen's childhood and young adult life were terribly difficult she exudes joy, hope and love. She took her experience teaching children and translated it to her bird girls. She found her own voice and helped animals find theirs. Bravo to everyone involved in the film especially Ellie and Jen.",False
10,10,Insightful,RachelR-90,n/a,15/08/2025,"This beautiful film brings to the screen a story of suppressed intellect that needed a vehicle. This applies both to Jen & her parrot Ellie. The unfolding of a lawyer becoming a scientist & her parrot finding a way to express herself is charming & moving but also fascinating. The science is ever present. Themes of perseverance & finding peace through healing & community are interwoven with the facts of animal congnition. A must see! Even my middle schoolers were enrapt. I feel educated, empowered, & heart warmed. This is something special. Whether you work with animals, nonverbal humans, attachment challenges, adoptees, grief, research, this film is multifaceted & will leave you changed by what you witness.",False
11,10,A must watch for animal people,jentlepirate,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love this film!!! I'm so blown away by Jen's work!I absolutely loved this film! The work that Jen has done is incredible and I'm lucky because I got to see it in the theater!I recommend watching this!This film is educational, heartwarming, funny and inspiring. Learning about Jen and Ellie's journey together is something everyone should see.She is helping animals communicate- and let us know if they're in pain and giving information that is so important it can change the relationship for animals in captivity/ in sanctuary.Thank you Jen and Ellie and everyone that brought this together!!",False
12,10,Like nothing I've seen,DanaR-220,n/a,15/08/2025,"It all started with a quiet girl who grew up to be a world changer. Jen is the embodiment of kindness strength and love. She's also a lawyer, scientist, and mom to parrots who can read!I smiled almost the entire time although I teared up a couple of times. The science itself is so exciting and try not to fall in love with sassy Ellie!Watching history unfold on social media is one highlight of our era. Jen and her parrots will be remembered for this groundbreaking research and finding about animals minds and emotional intelligence. She persisted when faced with naysayers over and over and the science is becoming undeniable. Cognitive dissonance in humans minds will take more time.It's just a great story! Go see it.",False
13,10,Amazing,dsb-55286,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've been following Jen online for years and am amazed at her persistence and creativity that led to a wonderful relationship with her birds -especially Ellie. Watching them progress was mesmerizing, and seeing it put all together in this film was a great experience. I wish I had the time and patience to work with my parrots and dogs to create a closer relationship.I had never met anyone that had been in a cult and left. I always assumed that they would be messed up for life. But not Jen. I was so impressed that she had such strength and sense of self to put her life back together and to thrive.I know that Jen and her work will have a round impact on inter-species communication.",False
14,10,beautifully balanced,RizalaC,n/a,15/08/2025,"Elle and the entire team are absolutely amazing! I genuinely loved this film-it's the kind of story that stays with you long after the credits roll. It beautifully balances emotional depth with moments of lightness and joy, making it both thought-provoking and uplifting. The performances were heartfelt, the direction was strong, and the storytelling was authentic and resonant. Jen is also an incredible teacher whose guidance clearly shines through in the work. You can feel the care, passion, and talent that went into every frame. Thank you all for creating something so moving, honest, and memorable!",False
15,10,So Important!,anyalikesdogs,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've been a fan of Jen and her birds for a few years now, and I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this documentary. The work she and her team are doing is revolutionizing the field of animal communication, and it's wonderful to see them getting the recognition they deserve! This film shines a light on one of the most fascinating fields of science, while focusing on the most adorable star! It's no wonder so many people are skeptical. The things Ellie can do have been considered impossible for decades, if not centuries. The impact of her work cannot be overstated. Can't wait for the rest of the world to catch up! I feel like this film is going to take the world by storm!",False
16,10,Can't wait to watch again!,reneet-20,n/a,15/08/2025,"Unbelievable journey of helping people understand animal cognition & communication. Animal people know they are this smart, but not much research has been done to prove it & help move it forward until now. This documentary could be life changing for how we communicate with animals. It's so refreshing to see people dedicated to bringing goodness into this world. Great job to everyone who worked on this gem of a movie, especially the star, Ellie! She might not know how much she's changing things for animals everywhere, but I hope people take notice & keep pushing what we thought were the boundaries of animal communication.",False
17,10,"I am just fascinated with Jen ,Ellie,tillie and the parrot kindergarten",NyckiB-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"The best information to bring to light our past present and future of animal communication ! Jennis the best teacher ever .Ellie and her relationships with her mom and sisters melts my heart every time. Thank you for enlightening the world of this precious information! I can not wait to follow this continued journey of love life and laughter in one flock . Amy and her team brought out the key ingredients for a great documentary. I hope there are many more documentaries to unfold before us m, sharing the knowledge they have already discovered while educating us on the possibilities we all contain and can share with our animals .",False
18,10,Such a wonderful film,imdbfan-574407,n/a,15/08/2025,"I absolutely loved this documentary and was moved to tears several times throughout. I am so grateful to Jen for her persistent pursuit of this field and for her kind, compassionate approach. For once we can see a scientist at work whose respect of her subjects is on an equal footing with her determination to maintain scientific rigor. It is unfathomable to me how Jen has overcome so much and reached such inexorable heights in so many areas. She exemplifies strength and in such a source of inspiration to so many. This film captures all of this and more and also introduces us to Ellie, the Goffin's cockatoo whose work alongside Jen is groundbreaking and, I hope, will improve the fate of all of the beautiful animals who inhabit this earth. I loved loved loved this movie and urge everyone to watch and enjoy while it's still available!",False
19,10,Ellie and Jen are an INSPIRATION,heather-15818,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ellie and Jen are an inspiration both for the increased happiness of the creatures on this earth by demonstrating in a way that science is finally unable to ignore... that YES - animals are able to communicate in a way that humans can clearly understand, but also have opened a new way forward for the studies and the field of Animal Cognition and Communication.I have been following @parrotkindergarten on Instagram for years and have seen the evolution of the teaching, and learning Ellie and Jen have been working on... it's astounding and I am continually amazed at what is Ellie is able to do. She can clearly - as the day is bright... read, write, share her thoughts and feelings, show understanding and communicate clearly about death, cancer, if she has pain, her emotions, time, weather, her likes and dislikes, what makes her happy and mad and her anxiety over lightning and storms and love of all things Dragons. She also knows how to throw shade... SLOW SLOW SLOW vs FAST... apparently ""in bird"" calling someone SLOW is an insult, and FAST means you are awesome!This movie was a joy to watch and the triumph of Jen with her research - born of love and a desire to understand and heal both Ellie, and her other feathered children and herself... was truly uplifting and inspiring.Netflix needs to pick this up!!! It was amazing!",False
20,10,WE ALL KNEW PARROTS ARE SMART,mimigrealtor,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's an amazing true story of love, loss and dedication! Jen has worked so hard to enrich and communicate with her parrots which we all would love for our parrots, too. It means so much to all us parrot parents. It's a must see for us all to learn! I'm looking forward to learn more to be able to work with my parrots. I'd love to be able to communitcate and understand their needs and wants more. It's so amazing that Jen has done all the hard work to initiate what options we have to use to bring them closer to us. I'll be trying the apps, tablet and techniques that already are working so well. Thanks Jen!!",False
21,10,A documentary to open the eyes of the world,TimH-41,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a documentary about a bird. A bird who demanded to be heard and understood in a world that did not listen or understand.It's a documentary about a woman who listened, a woman who listened and understood.Moreover, it's a documentary about a people, who tried and tried to listen and understand the world around them and gave up - until one woman and one bird took it upon themselves to change that.It's a documentary about how a lawyer and a parrot began to change humanity's understanding about animal intelligence and communication. Their path - their struggles - their accomplishments and the road that got them to that point.It's a film that will change your mind in a way you didn't know it could be changed and challenge the positions you didn't know you held about the world around you. It's a film, that, given the chance, will change the world.",True
22,10,Dr. Doolittle Comes to Life,NancyC-94,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI've wanted to speak to animals since I was five. I guess I identified with the creatures who didn't have a voice, a way of letting you know how they felt. At twenty-five, I argued that humans and animals only differ in degree and not kind. I always knew. And now bird mother Jen (lawyer and scientist) has proven it scientifically. Using speech boards, she's taught her rescue birds to read and write, demand books on dragons and video chats. Ellie, Isabelle, and Tillie have healed the trauma of Jen's early life, when she was trapped in a religious cult and a difficult marriage. And Jen, an expert in loss and grief, helps Ellie, her co-star in ""Parrot Kindergarten,"" cope with feelings about death. Ellie grieves her lost sister Lily, and sometimes she's afraid of her own mortality!A bird often dies because she hides her illness until it's too late. What would your bird tell you about her pain, her feelings? Could you save her before it's too late?Many documentaries are informative and entertaining. But ""Parrot Kindergarten"" moved me to my core. It's a joyous validation that all living creatures--human and animal--can be given a voice, can be redeemed through love and the magic of science.",True
23,10,My mind as blown!!,saraelshennawy-12014,n/a,15/08/2025,"This should be watched by ALL animal owners. We've been doing it all wrong!!The documentary was honest, emotional, tragic, funny, cute and really informative. I cried, laughed and learned so much and couldn't be more appreciative.I immediately changed so much of what I'm doing with my Eclectus parrot and our relationship and his behaviour has already begun to change. I already talk to him and explain so much, but I've been underestimating him. I watched with my husband and kids and everyone is treating Cricket (my parrot) as he always should have been.I'm also joining the 'Parrot Kindergarten' and giving my parrot the life he deserves. Thank you.",False
24,10,Heartwarming story of interspecies communication,Michelle-9226,n/a,15/08/2025,Amazing documentary about Ellie's journey to becoming the chatty Kathy she is today. I cried happy tears throughout the whole documentary getting to see Ellie grow and be able to advocate for herself and get the love and care she wants. What Jen is doing is amazing. I can't wait to hear about the new animals she is helping give a voice to. I'd give this documentary 20/10 stars if I could. I'm even considering getting it and watching it all over again. Beautiful story and some beautiful girls. I can't wait to see how the new kitten grows up and learns to communicate their wants and needs via tablet.,False
25,10,Amazing!,BrittanyY-57,n/a,15/08/2025,"Can't say enough good things about it in every way! Love,love,love.Inspirational, moving, smart, loving, educational, cute, and funny!So important to spread everywhere!Hopefully this will change how people think about animals and will make people curious and compassionate.So much to learn and understand with this story about the animals and also the people. Jen has been doing such important work and has had so many breakthroughs and they all deserve to have their story told to as many people as possible so that it will change how people behave and communicate with animals and each other.",False

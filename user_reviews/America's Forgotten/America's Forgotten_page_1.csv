1,7,GET REAL,Naturalragman,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Due to possible political backlash, ALL crew have voluntarily withheld their credits, from the film.""I'm going to call BS on that... BS. It's simply a ploy to make a Documentary relevant. Not that it isn't somewhat. But...Get Real!",False
2,4,Not a well-made documentary,SmudgeSmill,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't have an issue with the message, but I do with the way it was evidenced.Spending 90 minutes laying out a handful of anecdotes is not sufficient to make a substantial and coherent argument.One of the anecdotes is simply a case of someone being accidentally killed in a car crash -- but the driver of the car was an ""illegal alien"". The argument that's rammed down our throats is that 'this never would have happened if there weren't any illegal aliens', which is as useful an argument as saying we would never have anyone killed by guns if we just rename guns as 'bullet propellers'.
If an anecdote of an illegal immigrant causing someone's death is evidence of how bad illegal immigration is, then an anecdote of an illegal immigrant saving someone's life is evidence of how good illegal immigration is.One of the other anecdotes is about a homeless veteran and his wife. As far as I can tell, this has absolutely nothing to do with illegal immigration other than the curious and baseless assertion that these people wouldn't be homeless if it weren't for ""illegal aliens"".In summary: even if this is an important message for Americans to hear, this documentary is not the way it should be heard.",True
3,10,A Compassionate Documentary Giving Insight Into Illegal Immigration,cacram81,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a powerful film and important for all to see. Americans need to open their eyes to look past all the propaganda and seek truth. This movie was very informative and shows the huge disservice illegal immigration does not only to Americans, but the illegal immigrants themselves. In order to fix problems we need to be informed, and can no longer tolerate the censorship and propaganda of the mainstream media and big tech. I applaud Namrata Singh Gujral and others working on this project for the courage to see it through. I really like how you showed the history to the work visa system in America, that unfortunately was terminated decades ago. While this film was made by Democrats, and I am a Republican. This shouldn't be a divisive issue. Leaders need to stop playing politics and pass laws updating our immigration system. It's about not allowing coyotes and cartels to take advantage of the vulnerable. It's about protecting lives. It's about doing right by immigrants and Americans.",False
4,4,All over the place,fegerkaren,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat was the point of the homeless veteran couple? What is the point of featuring homeless veterans? What did this have to do with illegal immigration? The creator seems to suggest, toward the end of the movie, that illegal immigrants are treated better than vets. Really? And what do veteran deaths in senseless, unjustified wars have to do with illegal immigrants grants? Would they still be alive today if there were no illegal immigration?Some of the stories are informative, but because the movie is all over the place it dilutes legitimate messages. No one would argue that coyotes are or that people who risk the lives of their children to make more money when they aren't oppressed are disgusting. But why highlight a story about a man dying in a traffic accident where an illegal immigrant was driving? Would his parents be less sad if an American citizen killed their son in an accident?",True
5,10,Illegal Immigration . . . What the Politicians don't want you to see,kinghq1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a VERY powerful look at Immigration. Not just here in the US, but what it takes to get TO the US. Director Namrata Singh Gujral looks at this issue like none other. This is NOT a Political statement, but a REAL, unfiltered, look at Immigration.",False
6,3,Really boring interviews,Erik_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is all basic info that any Republican already knows. The Director for this is a Democrat, so all this basic stuff she is just now learning by making this movie.I didn't learn a single new thing from this documentary.",False
7,10,"Truthful, Revealing and Empathetic - Triple Threat",madamannam,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie sheds light on the honest truth and corruption of illegal immigration but instead of leading with fear it's enveloped in compassion for both the illegal immigrants and American citizens. A revealing and honest perspective. It's the conversation we should all have. And unlike many documentaries these days, it even has some real suggestions and opinions on how to handle the situation, encouraging us to open up and discuss the topic.Bravo.",False
8,8,Aspects Of Immigration,yoninahthecat,n/a,16/08/2025,"The problem with all documentaries that have to be edited into a length accessible to the viewer is that you only have a limited time-frame in which to deal with the subject matter.The Director/Writer does a great job here, dealing with four (I think) specific 'lives' in order to draw together a series of warnings about the current state of the American Immigration System.What I found lacking, unfortunately, was the counterpoint, the deeper pry into those lives that were being presented to the Viewer as representative of the whole.The seemingly endless rows of homeless along the side the roads frequently filmed was played alongside the homeless Vet and his wife with the implied suggestion that they were somehow representative of most of those who find themselves 'on the streets'.The couple's story was important to cover - but with the necessarily limited time available, the thrust of the film must take on a narrow storyline that guides the narrative in one direction.This is no bad thing - it's just that it becomes a necessity.However, as the Media today take their listeners in a totally different route, this film is refreshing, challenging and worth watching. It stands alongside, for example, Simon Reeve's footage of his travels either side of the US-Mexico Border that was broadcast as part of the BBC Documentary series on America.This is not a pleasant film - but it's a necessary one.",False
9,10,The uncomfortable truth,cadimum,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary is very eye opening. Investigative journalism is all but dead. This movie however gives me hope and made me think. The only reason I didn't want to switch from Dem to republican was because of immigration. I did research and had to follow my heart and morals and switched after realizing much of what is in this documentary is blatantly true. Highly recommend!,False
10,10,America's Forgotten is truly a gripping and brilliant movie,platinum-36301,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I knew the issues surrounding the immigration debate, this substance-rich movie - an incredibly moving piece of art - brought such a level of depth and nuance that I recommend this movie to folks of all political persuasions.Namrata - Thank you for doing this amazing movie. You are brave! The big tech platforms that are trying to embargo this movie are really showing how weak their values-system is against the power of your message.",False
11,10,Honest,cwaller-47927,n/a,16/08/2025,This one the first honest documentary I have seen in years. Thank you so much for making this!! I am in the middle but lean right and this documentary was everything I have been trying to verbalize for the past several years. Thank you.,False
12,9,One of those films . . .,ghostjf-33001,n/a,16/08/2025,This is one of those films that every American should see. It takes a good look at the illegal immigration issue and even proposes a possible solution.,False
13,10,"Brave, raw, truthful",trimblair,n/a,16/08/2025,Scary stuff! Won't win awards from blue Hollywood but wow -- lays it out there. Facts are undeniable. Was getting fixed until Feb 2021. Now the worse it has ever been in our history. The people from India lured here for $50k from clips of Democrats promising them free healthcare and a life of luxury are heartbreaking. Should be required viewing for every voter!,False
14,n/a,Try the legal immigration process?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,The US take over one million legal immigrants every year. Is that not enough?Why feel bad for people breaking immigration laws?Sometime the right way works better than the wrong way.,False

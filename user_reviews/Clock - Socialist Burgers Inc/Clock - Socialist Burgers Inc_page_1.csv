1,7,Clocking In: Sweden's Socialist Burger Joint,robertbirming,n/a,16/08/2025,"A surprisingly captivating documentary! As someone who grew up in Sweden, I found it incredibly entertaining and interesting to get a glimpse into the ""old Sweden,"" a time that feels both familiar and distant. The film does a great job of transporting you back to that era. Even though I'm Swedish, I had absolutely no idea whatsoever that the government owned the Clock burger restaurants! It's a fascinating and almost unbelievable piece of Swedish history that I, and probably many others, were completely unaware of. The documentary explores not just the burgers themselves, but the broader social and political context of the time, shedding light on a unique period in Swedish history. It makes you think about how much things have changed, and how much they've stayed the same. I was particularly intrigued by the discussions around the socialist ideals that led to the government's involvement in the fast-food industry. It's a really thought-provoking film, and it's not just for history buffs. Anyone who enjoys a good documentary, or who is interested in learning more about Sweden, should definitely check it out.",False
2,1,Pathetic,philip-00197,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pathetic is, as it happens, an understatement.Not quite sure when ""blurring the lines"" became an acceptable ""thing"".Arguably there is some value in using an ""artist license "" when making films ""based on a true story"" - this for dramatical purposes. The mockumentary format is harder to build a case for - especially when the mock isn't instantly apparent.Clock - Socialist Burgers Inc. (Clock) pushes bending of the truth one step further. It wears ""the documentary cloak"" for way too long - and pushes the prank way too far.By blending a great proportion of truths with a small amount of desinformation, without clarifying ""which is what"" - the end product is ""just a lie"". With that said, it is not easy to place Clock in a genre. A guess, and it is just a guess, is that it is an attempt at humour. Calling Sweden Switzerland is about as amusing as it gets.There is plenty of desinformation ""out there"" - way too much. Listing something like Clock as a documentary and leaving it to the viewer to work out that it's ""a joke"" is a tall order.The viewing experience resembles the sensation of having been told an intricate lie and when the liar is caught out - being told ""it was just a joke"".This kind of production is not needed anywhere and, is arguably damaging.",False

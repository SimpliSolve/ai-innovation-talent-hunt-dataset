1,9,Captivating documentary,fergal-952-215154,n/a,15/08/2025,"From the moment this documentary film starts you will be swept up into the very fabric of the story. It weaves, twists and enthrals. You can feel every frustrated breath Patricio takes as he tries desperately to rescue his seven grandchildren - and all of this set against the grief of losing his daughter, mother to those children.The wall of inaction Patricio has to bang his head against would leave most of us fatigued and defeated. Not this man. He has a singular vision - to be reunited with his grandchildren. He encounters bluff and shadows from the politicians and governments - he quite literally appears to be on his own. Not to spoil the ending but it is well worth watching. Humanity has a future and his name is Patricio.",False

1,9,The content Netflix is known for!!,lovishbansal-31555,n/a,15/08/2025,As a netflix worldwide fan i can say this is the content indian netflix needs. This is what netflix is known for. The boldness and fierceness of each episode is amazing. I would love to see more of these netflix documentaries in india on indian problems. Truly must watch.,False
2,8,Kick-Ass show,shashankpatel-37369,n/a,15/08/2025,"The only idea behind this show is to expose the so-called billionaires who looted the public money and how easily they could get away with it. Starts with the flamboyant Vijay Malia who shook the whole economic industry with his scam followed by the others belonging to the same club. The real fun to watch in this episodes are the speakers of the show like Siddharth Malya, Shobha de and many more in the following episodes. They share their views about what happened was it right was it wrong and what they actually think about it.Netflix has tried to be as real as it can be and I guess has done a fantastic job of pulling up this all together. It does really take the guts to plot something like that on such a realistic way on a platform like Netflix because almost everybody's going to watch and will have an idea about how the things went what went wrong and who was the real cheater or the bad boy and how could they get away with it and doesn't regret it either.
It's such a shame to have something like that. But the show is really good to see for somebody who likes to have an idea about all this. Great work Netflix.",False
3,8,Really good investigate journalism series of India's biggest fraudsters,harshpatel-39888,n/a,15/08/2025,Probably it's the first such series based on Indian fraudsters. It's really informative series to see all the facts in one episode as news articles only gives you bits and pieces making it hard to comprehend. I would have liked some more focus into role of financial centers like London who house such characters from around the world.,False
4,9,Brilliant documentary!!,sriramthestranger,n/a,15/08/2025,"The 3 episodes covering the bad boy billionaires of India - Mallaya, Nirav Modi and Subrata Roy is just spot on. Their rise and personality are captured in the true sense as a businessman and not like Bollywood villains. But, I felt the makers should have interacted with the bankers and lawyers. Because, ultimately it is the banks having the money of the public gave the loans to these tycoons. How can they be soooo corrupted (or) negligent?! Anyways, one of the finest documentaries on India. Must watch!!",False
5,9,Good investigative journalism. At least people are starting to talk in India,manpreetdallas,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was eagerly waiting for this to come on Netflix which in fact was delayed due to lawsuits in India and finally I was able to watch all three of the 1st season yesterday. It is well done. More or like American Greed type.Interesting part is that at least we are starting to see more investigations opening in India which so far were never touched or talked. It would be good to see if any of these financial journalists who did a great job can also try to dig into Diru bhai, Bofors and many more cases which could be interesting to investigate. I really do not know how much of freedom of press and expression is in India today but again a good job.",False
6,8,Real Badass episodes!,ankytd,n/a,15/08/2025,Its amazing to see the scale at which this series have been made. Quite investigative and the balance between the appearing interviewees. We would love to see Bollywood Bad boys too.,False
7,8,A story of crook,priyesh221292,n/a,15/08/2025,A very detailed story of crook who once was king of good times.,False
8,7,How much is too much? !!,madhukar30,n/a,15/08/2025,"Bad Boy Billionaires: India is biographical profile of the leading defaulters in India. It's highly informative, very interesting and the presented in very sophisticated professional manner. There are lots of famous guest speakers who are of significant importance, adding value to the show. These opinions are aided along with tons of rare archival footage, unseen to the eyes of the common man before. Each of these men started out with a dream, and then could not or would not stop when things got out of hand.The show was set to be released originally on September 2, 2020 but it had hit a legal hurdle after Mehul Choksi, whose name appears in the series, along with Roy and Raju approached courts seeking stay on the docu-series saying it would affect their trials.Overall, a must watch series to all Indians for understanding the real facts, though documentary does not offer us anything about how every account holder with the bank was paying the price of those unlimited Letters of Undertaking. In the end no one seems to be able to tell how much was too much? When does a bad boy face the consequences for his actions? Is there punishment for those who aid and abet?
None in the near future, or is it?",False
9,8,Stick one's neck out.,Quirk47,n/a,15/08/2025,"Vijay Malya, Nirav Modi,Subrata roy
A Man with dreams that comes to end by default in loans. A man with ideas who is very confident in his strategies completely gone wrong by exposing the truths behind it. A Hubris Man who is actually a guru to lot many people is a foe now in every citizen. The rise and fall in life here shows us some important mistakes that we shouldn't do. Everybody has dreams. To follow up in wrong Direction is undoubtedly wasted oppurtunity. I am waiting for Satyam scandal.",False
10,6,Nothing new.. perhaps edited.....,hkv-76955,n/a,15/08/2025,"Saw episode 1, vijay malya, seems badly edited, no mention of calender girls, his 5 star bungalows, his movie production for engaging heroines and political understandings... üôÅ",False
11,8,"The dirty world of money, politics and crime.",piyush-29492,n/a,15/08/2025,It tries to give you both sides of the stories behind all these scammers..but fails to tell that they are the real culprits..more like a soft attack on these criminals.,False
12,7,Fun & entertaining,sahebabdullah,n/a,15/08/2025,The show tries to do whitewash but despite that i feels good watch.,False
13,1,Heavily biased,SG0607,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am appalled by the mallya episode. trying to garner sympathy for this crook using sycophants as interviewees. These people are white collar terrorists who should be hanged till death or shot dead. His useless son says ""they want to make an example out of him""by sending him to jail"". There is a smirk on his ugly face all the time. No remorse what so ever. Another sycophant crabtree is trying to garner sympathy for him by blaming everyone but him and how his business is looked down upon in India. Another sycophant says ""he is a kid and wanted to really save the airline"". He is nothing but an evil soul. Like one employee mentioned - ""there are bigger crooks doesn't absolve of him of his crimes. He is a petty criminal in a suit."" People committed suicide because of him and he has blood on his hands. It would have been better if they had included testimonies of real people/employees who were affected apart from the 2 employees shown.",False
14,10,Must watch,arrshsrk,n/a,15/08/2025,I think every Indian should watch this documentary to know the fraud happens in india by some particular rich people...,False
15,10,Gripping and balanced,sohilcool83,n/a,15/08/2025,Glad to see this genre of docuseries being made on Indian topics.The series is treat to watch. Each episode contains a detailed rise and fall journey of billionaire Indian defaulters.,False
16,10,Great work,varunpatill,n/a,15/08/2025,The 2nd and 3rd episodes are awesome. And especially the episode of subrata roy got me so furious. The best scam story i've ever heard,False
17,9,Hard hit,sangavia,n/a,15/08/2025,"Netflix never miss a chance to pull it's strings on dirty laundering, it's the core fact, when EGO becomes pride of humans nature ""I am Invincible God"" and till what extent you go to keep denying the facts, the worst part comes with Sahara owner who is monster of pure evil,",False
18,6,Please do a feature on untamed Bollywood,amazonprime-60986,n/a,15/08/2025,"Please do a feature on untamed, over privileged , and murky world of Bollywood.",False
19,10,The reality!,kharevijayavk,n/a,15/08/2025,"Amazing seriest that shows the reality of how things went down for the biggest business tycoons of India who were eventually unveiled to be frauds. The episode on B Ramalinga Raju, whose scam was probably on the largest scale among all , is very much awaited!",False
20,n/a,India Does Not Know How to Make Documentaries or Expose,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,This had potential but it was filled with cookie cutter interviews that made the crooks look good. It was hard to watch and just shows how many Indians are so money hungry that they will not say a negative thing about people who defraud many.,False
21,7,"Intriguing, Curious",toolongdidntmovie,n/a,15/08/2025,Have you ever wondered growing up listening to names of some of the greatest frauds in History wondering how do they get away with it? Well if your curiosity has got the best of you I Highly recommend you watching this series! I can't say much about this series as its pretty self-explanatory and describing this would just ruin your viewing experience in general.,False
22,8,one of the best and gripping documentaries netflix show..,acharyapunit,n/a,15/08/2025,"Plot:-story of India's once famous and top buisness tycoons, explores the greed, fraud and corruption that built them up - and ultimately brought them down...screenplay and editing:-I m mentioning screenplay bcoz the real footage which has been used, it is used in such a way that whole 3hr show(3 episode)of this 3 businessman becomes very entertaining and at the same time totally real,explores their real life and real stories,it doesnt glorify anyone in good way which is very good they have done all wrong scam,fraud and it has been shown properly in this show..Direction:-actually editing is the overall direction of this show,real footage,dubbing,colours everything was in syncoverall review:-the real story of vijay mallya,nirav modi and subrata roy,if you dont know anything about and want to know about them and their overall scam their stories then dont miss this one at the same time this 3hr show is very entertaining and gripping,available at netflix!!",False
23,7,Informative,naiksourab,n/a,15/08/2025,Each episode is 1 hour long and it would be really good if it was a bit less than 1hour because the amount of information they have can be fitted under 35-40 mins but they dragged it to 60,False
24,1,"Badass, my foot",veynz1,n/a,15/08/2025,"You call this a documentary? It's just old news reheated and served. There's nothing in each episode that one didn't know about. One expected some deep digging, uncovering of harsh truths and a gripping narrative. What was not expected was showing some personalities sympathizing (Shobha De with her ""Little boy lost"" comments in the Vijay Mallya episode), and worse, some even admiring (that moronic advertising director who thinks Nirav Modi is 'badass'!!!). I was so disappointed, I didn't bother seeing the third Subroto Roy episode. Forget bingeworthy, this is absolutely cringeworthy!",False
25,8,Highly recommended watch.,nadkarnisumeet,n/a,15/08/2025,"Bad Boy Billionaires India (Documentary) review :Released on Netflix earlier this month, Bad Boy Billionaires India documents the rise and fall of three noted industrialists - Liqour baron Vijay Mallya, Diamantaire Nirav Modi and Saharashri Subrata Roy. Each episode has running time of close to an hour and comprises of news clippings, interviews and relevant life events properly presented in a story format.Personally, I liked the Mallya piece the most followed by Saharashri ki Kahaani and then Nirav Modi's tryst with Punjab National Bank. An episode of Satyam owner Ramalingam Raju was also shot but not streamed due to legal issues. I hope they do it soon as it will certainly make for an interesting watch, specially for a finance professional like me.One common factor in all the three (alleged) fraudsters lives is the presence of top Bollywood celebrities gracing their parties and wedding ceremonies. It clearly highlights the parasitic nature of that industry.Overall, this is a brilliantly directed documentary which is highly recommended.Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",False

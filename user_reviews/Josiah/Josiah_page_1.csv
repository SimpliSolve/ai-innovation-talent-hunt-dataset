He got mixed up with drugs and the everyday battle he went through to try and stay clean! It's an eye opener on how drugs can take over someone's life even though they were raised with love and support. I know the family personally, I knew Josiah he was an awesome kid and man!

I watched it with my teenage boys!",False

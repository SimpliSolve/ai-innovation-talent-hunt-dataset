1,8,The story of A-ha,dakjets,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Norwegian pop sensation A-ha has had a long and eventful career. This documentary is based on the music, but also how the members have experienced being part of this pop group. What I really appreciated about the documentary is that it devotes a lot of space to just the music. The film deals with the group's releases in chronological order, and allows members to tell about the background for different styles and choices. For those of us who grew up with A-ha, this provides new insight and it is exciting to hear Morten Harket, Magne Furuholmen and Pål Waaktaar talk about songwriting, production and not least the collaboration between them. This documentary also reveals strong disagreements between the group's members, and the disagreements they have had that at times have made it difficult to keep the group together. I find this documentary both insightful and entertaining. It also has many new recordings of the group over the years. Key people also contribute. This makes the documentary appear solid and worth seeing.",False
2,8,Perfect imperfections?,paul-romani,n/a,16/08/2025,"This felt like a very personal movie to me, but left me almost as melancholy as their supposed breakup(s).Before reviewing the film, I want to give some context about the A-Ha and my feelings about them.CONTEXT
A-Ha has been my favourite group since I was a kid. As with any fan, my favourite songs aren't the ones they released, but the hidden gems that later became more common on their playlists: Living A Boys Adventure Tale, Here I Stand And Face The Rain, Cold As Stone, Locust, There's Never A Forever Thing, Sycamore Leaves, Lifelines, Sunny Mystery, Minor Earth Major Sky.Albeit, at this point, Morten can't sing some of those songs live like he once could, which about sums up my feelings on this film. It leaves you melancholy that you're watching a group that is now a shadow of their former selves.A-Ha, for me, is a somewhat of a tragedy of a band (like the Verve):They've written some of my favourite music, much of it never heard by the general public, so they're always judged on the more popular chart stuff (as is my choice in bands). They have constantly messed up their careers as a group and individually, so the media keeps thinking that they're making comebacks with every album release - even though they've only broken up twice.They're judged as a boy band because of the attention that Morten (still) attracts from his female fans. But, personally, I feel that the songs should mean as much to men, if not more so.They're three guys that have the most bizarre relationship and personalities. They're like family members that you love, but find so fricking frustrating! Three grown men that STILL can't see each other's perspectives, yet can write such beautiful music about life and woes!""Sort your problems out, guys!""I wonder if even Norwegian people understand the logic of their personalities?!!!They've broken up twice. Once back in 1993 when they disappeared without telling their fans anything. It was like not knowing if a lost relative was alive or dead. Thanks guys. Yet, as the movie shows, they had plenty of information that they could have shared with fans.Then, they 'broke up for good' in 2010. I was incredibly sad when this happened, but at least I knew it was coming and could learn to live with it. In some way it did kind of end on a high note.Then they got back together again...I asked myself, why?! Yes, some of their new music is good, but there is something missing now.I did NOT enjoy the acoustic MTV Unplugged tour.I actually preferred Morten's solo album (Brother) to a new A-Ha album. While I've (mostly) liked his solo albums - they aren't as good as his A-Ha work; at least not until now.The current world tour seems utterly pointless and soul sucking! They haven't released a studio album since 2015. Their tours now are like those old 80s bands that have been touring since then with no new music. It's sad. They are a shadow of their former selves, especially Morten (although I love his Brother album!) - hence the need to play the album songs over Morten's live performances in the film.THE FILM
In many ways, the film really shouldn't exist. Yes, as a fan, I have this morbid curiosity to 'see' my favourite group behind the scenes and from the past. I put 'see' in quotes, because how well can you really see A-Ha. They are such complex individuals who reveal little to nothing about themselves, but just give you a taster of something.I thought, wow, you have all of these cool videos and photos going back to the Hunting High And Low album - and you never released them to fans until now?! Why not?But, it's watching their passive aggressive in-direct bickering to the camera, while pretending to be nice to each other. Why do they bother getting together if they feel that way about each other? If they secretly feel some kinship, then say so. But, otherwise, it comes across as if they are using each other for their own ends - there is nothing admirable about that and I don't want to see it. Magne looked in so much sadness and bitterness, which was uncomfortable to watch, because you then see him performing with them. Magne, why bother if this how you feel?The impression is similar in how I think they feel about their fans. It's a love/hate relationship (sorry ladies, but you dream all you want about Morten, but he doesn't give a rats ass about you). You can see how they need to feel periodically recognised and relevant, but can't wait to escape into their Mercedes Maybach cars and drive away from them at top speed. They cringe whenever they receive any praise - only caring about how much praise they each get and feeling bitter about the inequality of it. I understand this, but who's fault is it that Morten gets the most attention and Magne gets the least?Ultimately, given what I mentioned earlier about the lack of new material since 2015 and the previous 'permanent breakup' in 2010, I'm wondering what is the point of this film. They clearly have no plans to make any new songs - yet the film dangles the possibility to torment the viewing fans. Magne has made his lack of intentions very clear both for serious health reasons and because of bitterness over songwriting credits. Morten and Pal are too pigheaded to concede their own responsibility for anything, even though they both have the most influence over the band. It would be self serving of them to actually give a shit about each other. It provides us with little more information than was provided in the book about them (A-Ha The Swing of Things 1985-2010).So, that leaves the band out there doing world tours for no reason.Overall, I watched the movie with curiosity. I enjoyed the unreleased behind-the-scenes film footage and photos from the past, but the film left me feeling melancholy at watching a squabbling group of 60 year olds that still can't sort their problems out.",False
3,7,ahhh the 80's,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Morten Harket, Pål Waaktaar, and Magne Furuholmen are still performing. The Norwegian trio has been a-ha on and off for four decades. Their song was everywhere for a good second. More importantly, there was that music video. For a few months, they were one of the biggest bands in the world. After their catchy follow-up song, I really didn't follow them too closely. They would show up here and there. Their new songs never caught my ear. Nevertheless, it's great to relive the 80's.I always thought that they were just a Norwegian boy band which couldn't break the language barrier despite speaking functional English. Like most people, there is deeper waters here. One thing I didn't know is the friction within the band and some of their dissatisfactions. I understand their need for artistic fulfillment. The fact that they are still making new music is a testament to that. This documentary allows for a bit of nostalgic remembrance but also reveals something more about the band.",False
4,9,"For A-ha fans, amazing; for non-a-ha fans, a headscratcher.",sacha_brady,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not nostalgic, but I enjoyed this.I think it was frank and for those with any appreciation for the band's work, provided a context for their major releases.My only criticism, understandable for a band going so long, would be that the transition from album to album was fast, without much insight into where the albums fit into their history.If you love the songs, the commentary from the group makes a difference. If you come to this without any previous knowledge of a-ha, much of this will likely fly over your head.A-ha are the most frustrating band ever. I think many fans believe they are less than the sum of their parts and wait for an album that really shows what they are and can be. ""Scoundrel Days"" comes closest for me. But a-ha seemingly can start a fight in an empty room. And, alas, let time slip through their fingers and so continue to interact like strangers meeting for the first time.If you're a fan, like me, you probably hope for a series to properly explore the workings and history in depth. But if you're not, I'd suggest keeping your expectations low unless anthropology is your thing.The major lesson for me is that this is a love-hate relationship band if ever there was one, and in their never-ending fight for identity with one another, they allowed their individuality to become lost, ironically, despite having one of the most distinctive sounds of the time.",False
5,10,"Headlines & Deadlines, the pains of a-ha",Sinbaddylad,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary made for the fans, with a strong nod to those who will seek out their catalogue after viewing. With a large nod to Ron Howard's Beatles doc, Thomas Robsahm has opened the a-ha box and has shown everyone the pains of when 3 of the most talented musicians ever, collide to make timeless classic pop music with 3 different directions.What the non-fans will admire from the doc is the raw talent from an early age - Mags learning keyboards in just a few weeks - the record breaking crowds, the solo projects and how 3 close friends ultimately respect each other - even when not liking each other.What the fans will see is a dark picture of pain, distrust, lack of empathy and a drive to be World Famous - but then deciding fame wasn't for them at all.It's a very well put together timeline which intersperses with old and new footage, rehearsals, recordings and not a single interview of the band together. You'll love it.",False
6,10,Cosy Prisons,dawnprobst,n/a,16/08/2025,"A-ha: The Movie could have easily devolved into a tabloid-esque expose on the strife and egos of a band that has been in the limelight for more than 35 years. It never goes there. Yes, there is some strife, some disagreements, some resentment, but it's never the focus of the movie. Instead, it becomes a sympathetic psychological treatise on the effects of chronic fame on three individuals, a view unsullied by the usual tropes of debauchery and substance abuse. The result isn't a sudden implosion but a steadily dripping tap, slowly eroding the creative drive. The effects interfere with the physical health, the need to retain creative control, and the ability to find sanctuary in a sea of noise - a world full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Some of the stories are well-known, the stuff of legend among fans; some are less so, culminating in an extremely vulnerable moment shared (and for that, I thank him), painful to watch and obviously excruciating to experience. The movie ends not as a coda, but with an ellipsis, leaving open what may come, never attempting to speculate beyond asking each member the time-worn question: ""Will there be another new album?""Sincerely, an a-ha fan in the U. S. since 1985.",False
7,10,Long Live A-ha!,Lackluster-Me,n/a,16/08/2025,"Legendary Norwegian band arrive at the big screen in this phenomenal documentary. It follows them and their whole career from kids in Oslo dreaming of music to now. I like to consider myself an a-ha fan, but I was surprised at how little I actually knew about the trio.To fans, this is a must-watch. To people who aren't fans, I still would recommend this as a wonderful drama set to wonderful music. The story is told through interviews, vintage photos, concert clips, and more. It's a phenomenal movie and just go watch it for yourself. Chances are, even a-ha's biggest critics can still find something to enjoy here.",False
8,9,Great and sad,rainmar-822-625346,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a good documentary about my favourite band growing up on the 80's. I still contend that Scoundrel Days is one of three perfect albums ever made. The other two being Joshua Kadison's Painted Desert Serenade and U2's Joshua Tree.It was sad though to see the ongoing strife and resentment between the band members. At times the constant bickering seemed childish, but like a family does, they seem to get together again. Therefore, great and sad feelings were experienced watching it. I suppose life never really presents the fairy tales we were told as kids.",False
9,9,They Have Thrown Their Talent Down The Drain Because Of Ego's They Can't Share!,silicontourist,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have always thought the descriptive word for one particular style of music was utterly stupid. When music journalists or DJ's etc came up with the names, 'SOUL', 'Rock & Roll', 'ROCK', Heavy Metal' and 'Thrash' music etc they all make absolute sense. From early classical music to our now times of all styles of music they are all popular but, there is one music term used to describe a brand of music that does not and has not EVER existed. That descriptive word is 'POP' music. I mention that here because you find out in this documentary that it was not what A-ha started out to be and that they have hated the fact that they became a teen fave band. I largely credit that problem to them, and their naivety, with allowing too many people to have absolute control in their musical direction. The music industry (and I know this as a fact but I'm not mentioning name's etc.) is a very corrupt, greedy, life-force draining business that, if you let it, will use you up, severely overwork you, get as much out of you in profits as it can and, then ditch you and spit you out if you become worn out! A-ha have experienced (just slightly, luckily for them) some of the industry pitfalls but the rest of the failings they have created for themselves is purely of their own making; and they won't - for some unknown reason - try to solve their individual stubborn attitudinal ego problems.The most important comment in this entire documentary is expressed by a group members wife in the following line's, ""They need to first see a psychiatrist/psychiatrists individually and then as a group"". You will know exactly why when/if you watch this! For now they are just lucky they were not born in Japan or South Korea because, J-Pop and K-Pop is directly aimed at and for teens and it is seriously ten times worse in their individual countries music industries; utterly disgraceful in fact!I was, and still am to this day, an immediate lover of A-Ha's music and style from the absolute beginning and, I enjoy listening to their music just as much today. They have inspired some of the biggest names in music of the last 35 years but for their petty niggling and bickering amongst themselves etc, they have denied themselves a truly deserved 'Superstars' mantle of gifted for their unique musical style recognition!Watch it as it is a fascinating insight you never get to see (record companies hire people to hide all of this type of thing so that the money keeps pouring in).A lot of people would/will not like what I will finish with here but, they should disband and go their own ways. The Ah in A-Ha has gone.PS. I saw a documentary concerning the exact same problems about METALLICA. They chose going down the getting help path when things got bad/worse between them and, the psychiatrist path helped them BIG time!",False
10,9,"A wonderful band, with a rich history.",MNorge,n/a,16/08/2025,"A wonderful band, with a rich history. Far richer than many people most likely think. A band that has taken a lot of crap especially from the american music industry and music media, where the label only focused on the looks rather than the bands songwriting and composing abilities, insisting on turning them into a boyband. After 8 years, the band gave up on the US, but has recorded, released and toured til today and continues to do so. They have now released 11 albums. The most recent one in 2022.A very missunderstood band.The movie gives an insight into a complex friendship with it ups and downs, twist and turns and th e flip side of becoming famous too fast.The only negative thing about the movie, is that Take On Me is played way to much. . They should have included more songs from their catalogue of over 115 songs in the movie, to give an even more insightful presentation of the band.",False
11,10,Cracking doc showing their gifts and darksides,SoundrelDays,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI will try to remain as impartial as possible as I have to admit to being a long term fan of the bands music, particularly their live performances. As any fan will tell you, we see them as underrated. This may confuse some as they are obviously well known and had much success. Most of that success however was in their early years, riding on the back of a fabulous start and much regretted pop promotion with mainstream media. None of the early stuff really showed what a talented group they were. This docu film certainly helps to do that and shows why fans know they are underrated, it gets right into their hearts. Brutal at times for a fan when you realise that they were not enjoying the roller-coaster they are on but I'd rather have seen it than not. There are of course high points with the low and final scenes do sort of set up the possibility we now know as true north. Can't wait for that next year!",True
12,10,Three Men and Their Dream,hhnxdpr,n/a,16/08/2025,"You have already seen the biography of many famous and successful musical groups. The story lines are usually quite similar. A group of people with a common love of music and desire for fame struggle to achieve it. The X factor here being 3 young men from Norway moving to England to seek out their fortunes.And achieve they do, with relentless energy and patience. They have all the necessary tools from the beginning. Musicianship, looks, and pop music savvy. But like most successful bands, success doesn't just breed happiness. It births jealousy, contempt, and doubt.Through it all, the band keep it together. They achieve 40 years as a group and continue to write, perform and tour globally.",False
13,10,Fascinating and sad,SN1973,n/a,16/08/2025,"A-ha is one of the best bands of all time but being in A-ha seems to have caused these 3 super talented musicians angst and heartache. This movie keeps you riveted with the ups, downs, highs and lows. In some scenes you can feel the tension and feel uncomfortable for them. You get a real insight into their relationships, by observing the silences, the body language and the looks of weary frustration. You go in with assumptions about their characters and leave with a different perception all together. Anyone interested in music should see this, whether coming to it as fans or leaving as fans. A recommended watch; you'll come out thanking them for persevering and sharing their music and legacy with us.",False
14,10,I Know a Hit when I see it,Moonbeam_87,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yeah I don't need to see this to know it's a hit. I know a Hit when I see it. I lived Through a-ha and there song Take On Me. I was 8 When I saw it On Kid Video. Morten Harket was the Lead Vocalist, and Bunty Bailey was the Young Lady at the SAVOY Thumbing through the Comic Book that Comes To life in the Video. And as for Pal Due to the fact his Name is Pal Waaktaar Savoy, I think He owns the SAVOY Cafe. I Don't think I put Any Spoilers there, Maybe about the Videos Behind The Scenes. But This Movie, The Band, and The Video that Inspired it are ALL Deserving of My TM M For Moonbeam 87 Approved.",False

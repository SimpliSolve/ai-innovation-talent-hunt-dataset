1,9,He really is The Dude!,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Dude, aka Jeff Lebowski, is mistaken for a shady, millionaire businessman with the same name, a gang of thugs, searching for money, smash his place up and steal his rug. The Dude is given the chance to seek out those men.What a hilarious movie this is, from start to finish it's sheer brilliance, it doesn't matter how many times I watch it, I never tire of it, talk about a film you can watch over and over.It's genuinely funny, and with plenty of mixed humour, some of it's smart, some of its slapstick, some of it's a little surreal, overall, it just works. I'm not sure the story is anything new or complex, but that idea of two people with the same unusual name being linked by a crime, it works.The scene with Larry and the car is probably my favourite from the whole movie, talk about hilarious, that poor car.Jeff Bridges has put in some marvellous performances over the years, for me though, this is the best, he just nails it, he's hilarious.John Goodman is great, he steals many of the scenes, Julianne Moore is terrific, not sure if I prefer the accent or hairstyle, she's so good.Perfect music throughout, seeing this you'll want to download The Gypsy Kings. You'll want to sip a White Russian at the same time.A Joy!!9/10.",False
2,9,The Dude Abides...!,A_FORTY_SEVEN,n/a,15/08/2025,My Rating : 9/10You either hate it or love it. I am in love with 'The Big Lebowski'! I love most of the Coen Brothers' work and this one is right up there with Fargo and No Country For Old Men. It's super funny and can be watched again and again. I think I watch it once a year and always have a great time.One that I highly recommend. Go watch it! And then watch it again and again.AN AWESOME CULT FILM.,False
3,7,Good but a bit overated,joelgodinho,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Big Lebowski is a 1998 film directed by the Coen brothers and starring Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore and John Goodman
The Coen brothers are two of the best
filmmakers of the decade and one of their most popular movie is The Big Lebowski, and it's easy to see why, the film is absolutely hilarious I especially love the constant beatings that the Dude's car takes, the acting is on point with Jeff Bridges and John Goodman obviously standing out and the mistery and thriller part of the movie is actually pretty interesting too in my opinion. However I don't think the movie is perfect, I don't really get or find funny the dream sequences and overall I don't feel the movie is very memourable and doesn't stand out much for me. But that's just, like, my opinion man. 7.6/10",True
4,n/a,The film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's actually kind of hard to describe this movie (and what's so great about it) to people who don't already know it and love it; as with many cult films, The Big Lebowski will either speak to you (in which case you will become a fervent follower of His Dudeness and abide by his code for the rest of your life) or, if it doesn't, the film will either leave you completely indifferent or you'll even downright hate it.I believe it's a very funny film and I'm sure it can be rightfully called a comedy, but don't expect punchlines, gags, jokes or slapstick - it's not that kind of comedy. If you want to enjoy this film, you have to meet Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski on his terms, hang out with him and his bowling buddies and follow them at a their (perhaps somewhat leisurely) pace through this weird and unbelievable tale about nihilism, theft (of a car and, more importantly: a Creedence Clearwater Revival tape), kidnapping, abstract art, porn and - of course - bowling.The story is actually kind of simple. You see, some no-good German nihilists urinated on The Dude's rug - and this kind of aggression just won't stand against The Dude. With the help of his bowling buddies, he will do everything in his power to get someone to pay for his rug - or possibly get a new one (because that rug really tied the room together). So he embarks on this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things and fascinating people (even Jesus - who is NOT the messiah but a very naughty man).With Jeff Bridges in the leading role, the Coen brothers have found the perfect actor to incorporate one of the most iconic characters that has ever been created. But it's not just The Dude that makes this a winner; the whole film is such an inspired folly and simply inventive filmmaking at its finest (the hilarious dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission). The supporting cast is outstanding (J.Turturro, J.Goodman and S.Buscemi among many others), the song choices are perfect and the dialog is the funniest, most quotable in any comedy I've ever seen. This - for me - is without a doubt the film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",False
5,10,"You can watch it a million times, and yet, it will never get old",cleaf,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Big Lebowski is the type of movie that is so funny, and so clever, you want nothing more but to meet the Coen brothers, congratulate them personally for their unique talent, and get inside their heads and find out what makes these two geniuses ""tick"".  The main characters are Jeff Bridges (who plays such broad roles like The Muse, The Contender, and Sea Biscuit), John Goodman (who should have won an oscar for best supporting actor for his character, Walter Sobchak)Juliane Moore (Maude Lebowski)and Steve Buscemi (who is unique in every Coen Brother movie).The first time I saw this movie, I will admit that I enjoyed it, but did not fully appreciate its level of humor and raw talent.  I thought the middle section was a bit too depressing and long.  But trust me, this is a movie that gets more funny every time you see it, even if it's your thousandth time seeing it. Its level of comedy, action, brutality, and vulgarity become that much more evident and important.The characters are brilliantly written by the coen brothers, and, likewise, are brilliantly portrayed by the actors.  The Big Lebowski is like no other film.  It will make you laugh and it will make you cry.  There is no other film such as TBL that is sharp and witty all the way through. One of the Joel and Ethan Coen's best, and one of the movie industry's best comedic film of all time.  You want to go see this flick.",False
6,10,The Most Quotable Film of All Time,OttoVonB,n/a,15/08/2025,"Those Coen brothers have an ear for language. You feel it in the sing-songy banalities of Fargo, and in the noiresque machine-gun dialogue of Miller's Crossing, but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ears that is The Big Lebowski.Channeling the opaque mysteries of Raymond Chandler, the Coens throw LA resident bum and Bowling aficionado Jeff Lebowski (""The Dude"" to his friends) into a strange triple-crossing case of kidnapping, ransoms, nihilists and urinated-upon rugs. It is the equivalent of throwing unrelenting forces at an immovable object, the Dude's bemused stoicism at constant odds with the world around him. He'd much rather be bowling with crazed Vietnam Vet Walter (John Goodman) and pure silent soul Donnie (Steve Buscemi).As with so much of the Coens' output, style is more than half the point: not just visual, though ace DP Roger Deakins paints an alluring canvas, but tonal and auditory. This is an insanely funny head-trip of a movie, with wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, down to the smallest part. Who better than the Coens to reinvent the comedy of errors?This is without a doubt one of their very best, a personal favorite, an unmissable film and the kind of experience that will plant an indelible smile on your face. Do yourself and see this now, if you haven't already.",False
7,10,"It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners.""",Galina_movie_fan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLooks like while making ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998)– weird, nutty, outrageously funny and deliciously twisted movie, the brothers Ethan and Joel Coens, known for their unique and dry humor, sat back, laughed out loud, and had fun. ""Big Lebowski"" turned as one of the funniest comedies ever made. It is funny because of the incredibly off-beat characters, their weirdness, flaws, their interactions, the surreal situations they found themselves in, and perfectly written and delivered hilarious dialogs. There is the story, of course, which is based on the case of mistaken identity with the following kidnapping, villainous nihilists, vanguard erotic flying painter, the bowler named Jesus but the story is truly secondary to the delicious craziness of the movie.Some reviewers call Big Lebowski misfire and deranged mess, saying that the story is convoluted with the characters we would not care about a bit. It was also interesting to read the reviews that were written upon its release and compared it to Coens' ""Fargo"" that had been made a year earlier than the adventure of Jeffrey ""the Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges).""Fargo"" could be Coens' masterwork but it does not make Lebowski any worse. It was dismissed as the inferior film and was predicted not to stand the future re-watch. The time has proved the predictions wrong. ""The Dude"" Lebowski - middle-aged pot smoking, White Russian drinking, bowling enthusiast ex-hippie, and his friends, Polish Catholic converted Jew, ""more Jewish than Tevye"" Vietnam veteran Walter with anger management problems (John Goodman) and timid, little slow, ""sweet prince"" Donny (unusually quiet Steve Buscemi) have become the cult figures, the beloved characters, for millions of film lovers of different generations, not only the baby- boomers.The Coen Brothers have made twenty films, and all of them are treasure, including their contribution in the 2006 anthology, Paris, je t'aime. I've seen all their films and I want to repeat the title of my review on their latest, ""Burn after reading"" - The Coen Brothers don't make bad movies, because they don't know how. Their films, Including the cult favorite, Big Lebowski, should not be missed. They are clever, darkly funny, and beautiful without being pretty pictures. In short, they are first class entertainment.",True
8,10,Greatest movie ever made.,rlycar,n/a,15/08/2025,"With the combination of the writing of the Coen brothers and the Cinematography of Roger Deakins, they created a film as beautiful as it is funny. The Coen brothers consistently impress me with their ability to write an interesting story with fascinating yet quirky characters. Without resorting to gratuitous sexual scenes like many other writer/directors of R rated films the Coen brothers manage to add the right amount of language and violence that is necessary to the story without it becoming the only reason for watching. 'The Big Lebowski' has so many clever and hilarious lines that you have to watch it over and over again.Nothing else needs to be said about it other than it is the greatest movie ever made.",False
9,6,I don't get it,rmassey21,n/a,15/08/2025,I have rewatched this movie a number of times to see if maybe I missed something or maybe as I get older I will appreciate it more...I still don't really find it all that funny and certainly not worth all the hype. It's quirky and weird and that kind of movie has its place. Why there is such a cult following for this one I will never understand. Maybe it was hyped up too much for me from the beginning...,False
10,10,The Dude Abides!!!,Coxer99,n/a,15/08/2025,"No movie has entertained me more in the last year than this film. It's delightfully written, directed with poise and acted with extravagance and excellence. I do admit that this is a film that I had to see six times to get. Every time I watch it I learn something new. The genius of the film lies within a game I think the Coen brothers play with their audiences. There are the touches of the masters in many of their films. In ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" it was Preston Sturges and Frank Capra. In ""Raising Arizona,"" I felt a touch of Sam Fuller. In this film, I felt many touches of greatness, but more specifically I felt John Sayles or even John Cassevettes in spots. The camera was manipulated beautifully and I felt a tinge of their talents lurking in at many a turn. The performances are astounding, especially Goodman as the deranged bowler still living deep within the jungles of the Vietcong. Huddleston is also quite wonderful as the title character. Turturro gives a fine cameo as ""Jesus,"" coupled with a rousing and humurous version of the Eagles, ""Hotel California,"" done in Espanol. I hope this is a film that is looked at with more seriousness. It is, once you dig deep, a fine piece of filmmaking.",False
11,6,"unique, weird, but not that funny",SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's 1990. Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a lazy bum who insists on being called Dude. Two thugs break in to shake him down and pee on his rug. They soon realize they're mistaken. They're looking for the millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) whose young wife Bunny ran up a debt. The Dude's unstable friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) convinces him to go see the rich Lebowski for compensation for the rug. Later Bunny is kidnapped for a $1M ransom. Rich Lebowski asks the Dude to do the ransom hand off. Walter tries to double cross the kidnappers but the drop off goes terribly wrong. The money is stolen. All the while, the Dude and Walter is in a bowling tournament with Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) is Lebowski's daughter who wants the Dude to recover the money from the kidnappers.This is crazy Coen movie. This is a weird black comedy. It reminds me of the craziest parts of 'Raising Arizona'. It's a little too meandering with weird characters coming in every few minutes. This is much more weird than funny. I found only a few big laughs like the fking toe. On the other hand, it is completely unique. A lot of it is weird for weird's sake. It's a lot of weird. I get the sense that this is a great movie to have a good smoke while watching it.",False
12,8,Coen brothers unabashedly out of control!  A plethora of fun!,Ash-37,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Coen brothers are up there with my very favorite filmmakers (Scorsese, Kubrick, Carpenter).  I am very fond of their work.  Throughout their irreverent career, they have explored different subjects and themes.  Their best stories evolve from  kidnapping schemes in films like ""Raising Arizona "" and ""Fargo"", one of my very favorites.  I thought that film was fervently free.  I was so ever wrong. It's as if the Coen Brothers have celebrated their complete breakthrough success (Academy Award winners), and now are willing to do whatever they please.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is a film so meandering, so wonderfully novel, that I found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as I was heaving from laughter.  The film is basically about mistaken identity, eccentric characters, and a soiled rug.  This film extols the bowler, the allies, even the pins.  We experience an actual bowling ball POV, as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) hallucinates.  This film has nihilists, feminists, millionares, paedophiles, drugged out hippies, underachieving students, incompetent criminals, pornographers and 'Nam veterans.  This movie is open to anything , anything... Some people are turned off by absurd looniness, because it's so grandiosely different.  Yet who couldn't chuckle, if not explode, when a bowler dressed in a tight purple suit licks a bowling ball's finger hole, and the camera pans down to reveal his name as Jesus! I will disclose no more, but urgently recommend you to traverse to your nearest video abode and rent this true escapists' feature. Abandon all solemn inhibitons, though!  One can not keep a straight face whilst watching.",False
13,7,"Coen film with thrills , emotion , musical numbers and humor with tongue-in-cheek",ma-cortes,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Big Lebowskiv(1998) is an enjoyable film by Coen Brothers that packs thrills , dry humor , action , wonderful songs and numerous cinematic references . Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a stuck-in-the-70s stoner who insists on being called The Dude and loves to go bowling . He suffers a beating at the hands of thugs who are after money owed by a snutty wife who ruined some debt collectors.

They figured he was a lazy, time-wasting slacker !. They were right !. Her life was in their hands. Now her toe is in the mail !. Times like these call for a Big Lebowski !. It takes guys as simple as the Dude and Walter to make a story this complicated... and they'd really rather be bowling. Lebowski: Not a man, a way of life !An amusing and funny film in which our starring is drawn into kidnapping , attempted scamming of payoff money and more bowling . Starred by some rare characters suffering several Coanesque adventures ; what the protagonists encounter along the way are a number of surprising situations and weird roles that , when all is said and done , seem like just that individual incidents that never really add up to a whole plot . While this may seem like plot-a-plenty , it's mainly a showcase for the Cohen brothers' unique texturing of style and quirky but deep roles . Includes the Cohen's pithy dialogue , it looks and sounds marvellous . The film may not have the enigmatic elegance or emotional resonance of Barton Fink or Fargo , but it is still a prime example of the Cohen's efoortless brand of stylistic and sstorytelling brilliance . The highlight showcase is a stunning musical-bowling-fantasy sequence that would have made Busby Berkely proud . Main and support cast are pretty good . Jeff Bridges gives a sympathetic acting as the ultimate L. A. slacker Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski , mistaken for a millionaire of the same name and seeking restitution for a rug. Co-stars John Goodman as a fun and loud Vietnam vet who takes any opportunity into grossy obscenities. David Huddleston as the wheel-chair-bound millionare of the same name who assigns him to recover his sluttty wife performed by Tara Reid . While John Turturro steal the show as a pervert rival bowler who loves skintight lilac jumpsuits and polishing his ball.Thanks to Roger Deakin's gleaming camerawork the film expand a colorful and luminous cinematography . T-Bone eccletic selection soundtrack and agreeable score by Carter Burwell . This fun and entertainining motion picture was well written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen . They have shared these duties on all of their films, but Joel has always been listed as director and Ethan as producer . The first Coen brothers film where both he and brother Ethan Coen are given directing and producing credits was Ladykillers (2004). Both of whom are part of the prestigious group of individuals to have won Oscars for writing , directing and producing in the same year, for the film No Country for Old Men (2007). Their career is splendid from first film : Blood simple (1984) to Arizona Baby (1987), Miller's crossing (1990) , Oh Brother ! (2000) ,Barton Fink (1991), the great Lebowski (1998), The Man Who Wasn't There (2001) , Intolerable Cruelty (2003) , Burn After Reading (2008) , A Serious Man (2009) , True grit (2010) ,among others .

14,4,It's okay,woo-movies,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a 50/50 movie for me, it's just another movie I'm not happy I watched or sad if that makes sense. I get that why so many people like this movie, it's funny sometimes, and I guess for others funny a lot of the time, but for my sense of humor the comedy here is just alright. I just feel like it is a pretty pointless story, and even some of the characters are pointless. The start did get me a little bit hooked, it was intereesting to see how it would play out after the guy got mistaken for someone else. But it did lose me pretty quickly, seeing as the people there were just literally there, too much talking as well and the movie was in general too long. Someone being drunk isn't that interesting for me to watch for more than 5 minutes either. Again, it had funny moments and lines, but that just isn't enough for me unfortunately. Another overly hyped movie I just can't get myself to like that much, or that I felt like I was missing out. Safe to say cult classics just doesn't sit right with me, I haven't seen one cult classic so far that I would rewatch or really enjoyed.",False
15,n/a,Simply Beautiful,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a travesty that most critics only read The Big Lebowski at its most superficial level and called it a modern take on a Raymond Chandler potboiler. I simply can't begin to perceive how one could sit down in front of this cinematic pop-poetry, as it plates gold on the silver screen, and not feel so incredibly alive. The dream sequence Busbee Berkley musical numbers are unique and awe-inspiring; the humor is rich, subtle, and clever in the way it satirizes politically correct arrogance; the free-flowing story avoids (even pokes fun at) nonessentials like plot points and pay-offs. But what really makes this film such a masterpiece, such a panacea, is the incredible humanism, the care that the Coen brothers put in developing The Dude (Jeff Bridges), Walter (John Goodman), Donnie (Steve Buscemi-tremendously endearing), and Brandt (magnificently played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Looking at the films use of Sam Elliott to play The Stranger, who constantly rambles about the many wonders of The Dude (among other things), it is clear that the film is an ode to a Dudist way of life. And in a time where so many film promise that they have the answer to the worlds problems and end up as slick, stylistic show-off films, what more could one ask for than a good-hearted film like this? Not to mention the performance by Jeff Bridges, which ranks among the best performances of the nineties; he has a relaxed slouch, a goofy smile, an enthusiastic dance, and his buttons can only be pushed by Walter, who John Goodman plays with charm and fury. The Coen brothers have always been considered 'cold' filmmakers, but there is nothing here but warmth and humanity (as is the case with the Coens' Fargo). What we have here is one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema and if you can't see that, grab a White Russian, hit the bowling ally, and find your inner-Dude as soon as possible.",False

17,9,A wonderful film...with the word f#@$ used 102030841 times!,planktonrules,n/a,15/08/2025,"I tried watching this film on TV a few years ago, but I made the mistake of doing so with my kids nearby. In the first 10 minutes of so, I heard 'f#@$' (a word you are NOT allowed to use even once on IMDb) dozens of times. Realizing that the film was NOT family-friendly, I turned it off despite all the very positive reviews I'd read for it. However, considering I've seen all the Coen Brothers films except this one, I knew that eventually I'd get back to seeing it. Nearly a decade has passed, and I finally got around to seeing this cult favorite.Considering that there are nearing 1000 reviews for this film, I won't bother discussing the plot--it's been explained to death. Besides, the plot, believe it or not, is not all that important. As a mystery film, the mystery is figured out early in the film. So, despite this, why is the film so good--good enough that I gave it a 9 and many consider it their favorite film ever? Well, the Coen Brothers' bizarre and surreal style really make this film and off the top of my head I can only think of two of their films I liked better, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY (their most underrated film) and OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (their film that gets better with each viewing). This is very good company, as these two other films are absolutely brilliant--and I consider THE BIG LEBOWSKI to be much more interesting that the much ballyhooed FARGO (which, inexplicably, won two Oscars--despite not being among the brothers' best films because it's way too normal--sort of like a Coen Brothers film for those who don't get the more bizarre Coen Brothers films).What, in particular, did I like? Well, the characters were THE best part of the film--as only the Coens can create such quirky and unique characters. Simply put, there is no one like Lebowski in any of the thousands and thousands of films I'd seen before--and uniqueness is something I value most in a film. The alcoholic, lazy and hopelessly pathetic guy is like no hero you'll ever see in a film! The usual quirky characters are here as well--in spades! What I also loved were the little movies within the movie. When Lebowski got knocked out, you got to see his bizarre dreams that were more like films than dreams--particularly the one later in the film that just killed me it was so funny and stylish. Believe it or not, the dream is a phallic-filled song and dance film...directed by a famous porno director (though without actual nudity). It just has to be seen to be believed and only HUDSUCKER PROXY had stranger and more entertaining interludes. In fact, I found myself laughing out loud at this great scene...and a few more.Overall, a highly imaginative and wonderfully quirky film with very little plot and gobs of cursing. NOT family-friendly or a film to show your mother (unless you DO want to give her a heart attack), but still well worth seeing. Oh, and by the way, the version often shown on TV recently is an edited version with many of the expletives removed. The original actors provided alternative words for the f-bomb and it's done reasonably seamlessly. Frankly, I don't think it hurts the film and you still get to hear words like penis which have not been changed.",False
18,10,A Scrumptious Je Ne Sais Qua,terencebells,n/a,15/08/2025,"How mysterious certain films can be. They become addictive. I've seen Lebowski at least a dozen time and most of the times by accident. It was on TV or a friend is watching it and it is enough to catch a glimpse to be hooked, completely hooked. Last night I saw it on purpose with a couple of friends and I think I'm stating to realize what is it - A unique combination of talents all looking in the same direction --- The Coen Brothers are, probably, the only ones who know what they are seeing and the rest just trust their vision. Totally. Jeff Bridges is miraculous. His character is unique, never seen and at the same times is all of Bridges characters put together. I love him in this part and I love the Coen brothers for writing it knowing, I'm sure, that Bridges was going to give it that real, totally real surreal kind of life. Philip Seymour Hoffman, comes in to do what he does best, being memorable and then, of course, John Tarturro, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, delicious, each one of them - I'm pretty sure The Big Lebowski will be around for centuries and it will always have something to say even if we don't know exactly what.",False

It's about this guy, ""The Dude"", excellently played by Jeff Bridges, who gets an unexpected visit from two thugs who soil his carpet.

The soundtrack has no striking Carter Burwell theme this time (he only did that technopop thingy near the end), but it consists of various songs and themes, aptly chosen to befit the required mood; from classical to country or pop music and so on - I just discovered there's even a little bit played by the (Dutch) Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest.Apparently, there are some folks even who dón't like this film, or just don't get it, but I certainly don't feel like the Good Lord gypped me, because sometime there's a film... sometimes there's a film - kinda lost my train of thought here... but, aw, hell...11 out of 10.",True
21,6,"You see what happens, Larry?",CuriosityKilledShawn,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's hard to pick out one line of dialogue in particular for two reasons. One-almost everything said in this film is downright hilarious. And Two-the F word is spoken 281 times so there's not many sentences that don't contain it. 144 sentences also end in 'man'.Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski is a man living a minimalistic existence. He has no job, no ambitions and no worries. His days, be they weekdays or weekends, are spent bowling, driving around or having the occasional acid flashback. His pals are Walter Sobchak, a security expert and half-crazed Vietnam vet and Donny, a humble, mousy little man who is left out of almost every conversation.The Dude is happy with his easy-going life of nothingness until two thugs ambush him in his house believing him to the OTHER Jeff 'The Big' Lebowski, the millionaire with a trouble-making wife who owes money all over town. These thugs are none too happy with their dumb error and re-assert themselves by peeing on The Dude's rug.This very much displeases The Dude as this rug really tied the room together and since he cannot track down the 'Chinaman' thug responsible he decides to take it out of the Big Lebowski, as it's now HIM who owes a new rug. The Dude is welcomed into the Big Lebowski's mansion by Brandt the butler, a man so appallingly sycophantic he'd make Weylon Smither's look bad. But his millionaire namesake is not so ready and willing to give hand-outs and basically tells The Dude to get lost.At this point things become quite complicated as a bunch of ex-pop star Nihilist thugs, a powerful pornographer, a dejected feminist daughter, a Brother Seamus (NOT an Irish Monk), a joyriding teenager, a revolting pederast champion bowler, Saddam Hussein, a mysterious cowboy and a doctor who is insistent on him removing his shorts all make The Dude's life suddenly a helluva lot more interesting. The plot thickens and thickens and the dude is dragged to dozens of different places across LA, going from limo to limo, never too far from a white Russian or a doobie.There are zillions of idiosyncrasies in this film that keeps it new and interesting every time you watch it. Every scene and every line of dialogue is so memorable that, like me, you'll be acting the film out for years. Even on a 100th viewing you'll notice dramatic ironies, character arcs and ingenious wordplay that went right over your head before.The acting is superb. I am a fan of Jeff Bridges but he completely disappears in this film. He truly BECOMES The Dude and shows little of his recognisable self. John Goodman, in probably the most under-rated role of his career, is the world's angriest man. Bringing frustration and smart-ass arrogance to every scene (though he's almost always right). Set well over a decade after 'nam (and during the first Gulf conflict) Walter seems to be suffering from perpetual, ever-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome as he blows up in any situation. Take a look at his 'minor' confrontation with Smokey for example.It's not about plot, or even characters. It's about a certain moment in time, the early 90s. And the definitive man of that time was the Dude. The rug-peeing just happened to occur simultaneously.",True

23,7,"You call me the Dude, or his Dudeness, or El Duderino",beller-61993,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe story of the Dude (Jeff Bridges) is a strange one indeed. Content to spend his days drinking white Russians and bowling with his buddies Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi), the Dude is the alpha bum and ultimate passivist. A case of mistaken identity is what forces the Dude to react (first to get reparations for his soiled rug and secondly to assist in the recovery of Bunny Lebowski) and a torrid tale of plot twists ensues. The Coen brothers are master story tellers that love to tell dark tales that focus on the internal truths of human nature. They do not give us heroes, but instead present us with realistic characters that possess questionable morals as seen in some of their other films like No Country for Old Men, Fargo and more recently The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. The Big Lebowski is no exception as every character introduced possesses some form of character flaw. Ultimately what the Coen brothers are trying to show us (Theme) is that nobody is perfect and that even a bum like the Dude can own the moral high ground over those of higher stature.The Dudes first interaction with one of these characters of higher stature occurs when he is mistaken for the other Jeffery Lebowski (David Huddleston) as one of the thugs urinates on his rug. The Dude visits Jeffery ""Big Lebowski"" Lebowski at his mansion to ask him to rectify the situation by paying for the soiled rug. Even though Mr. Lebowski is clearly at fault and morally obligated to make restitutions, he proceeds to deny any responsibility for the wrongful actions taken against the Dude. This theme continues when the Dude meets Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara), who is the one responsible for the earlier assault. At first Jackie comes off as a reasonable man, offering to pay the Dude a finder's fee for recovering the money he is owed. We quickly find that this was just a set-up, as the Dude slowly drifts off to sleep from the drugs Jackie has mixed into his drink. On a lesser note, though Maude Lebowski's (Julianne Moore) character comes across as cold she appears to me morally sound, however she tricks the Dude into impregnating her as she does not want a father that is going to ""stay in the picture"". All of these characters are elevated members of society yet lack the same morality as the lowly Dude.Throughout the film, the Dudes character is challenged mostly by his friend Walter, who continues to try and manipulate the Dude's decisions. While making the drop off of the ransom money, Walter manages to botch the entire operation by throwing a ""dummy"" bag, and jumping out of the moving car (while driving) which subsequently wrecks into a tree while the dude is inside. However, the Dude maintains his laissez-faire attitude (except with Walter) and remains static all through the film. The reoccurring theme or motif of bowling and white Russians further solidifies the Dudes character as a devil may care ""hippie"" that is very much lost in time. His mind is never truly in the moment at hand, subconsciously thinking about bowling as evident in the two beautifully constructed dream sequences. The soundtrack for the film is the who's who of 60s era music, including the Dudes favorite Creedence Clearwater Revival. Deemed by many as a cult masterpiece, The Big Lebowski shows that even the humblest vagrant can be righteous if their moral compass is true.",True
24,4,I just don't get it.,innocuous,n/a,15/08/2025,"TBL is not a terrible movie, but I apparently just don't get it. My lady-friend's daughter is always telling her that she should see TBL in order to understand some of the ""in-humor"" and comments of her generation. I kept telling my friend that I really didn't think that the movie would be what she expected, but we watched it together anyway. (I had already seen it a couple times.) My friend was flabbergasted, as she couldn't identify any phrases, humorous scenes, or references that she had ever heard or seen her daughter's group use. She didn't like the movie, either, and was actually checking to make sure that it was the same movie her daughter had recommended.I feel the same way. Frankly, this movie is boring and pretentious. I love most of the Coens' work, but not this film. It goes into a category, along with ""Young Frankenstein"", of movies about which other people make a fuss and I just don't get. Maybe I'm slow.Anyway, if your idea of fun is watching a laid-back dude drink White Russians and a lot of unnecessary one-dimensional characters get layered on, go ahead. It's just not my cup of tea.",False
25,n/a,My favourite Coen brothers movie and one of the most entertaining and original comedies ever made!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"My favourite Coen brothers movie changes over the years as I watch and rewatch their amazingly original and consistently surprising oeuvre. When I first saw 'The Big Lebowski' on its original release I enjoyed it but thought it was a bit of a slight ""fun"" movie with less depth than many of their previous works. Now, a few years and several viewing later, I have come to realise just how accomplished a movie it is, and it has become one of my all time favourite movies. Other film makers have attempted to weave together various genres, styles and images in a similarly eclectic, postmodern fashion, but few do it as seamlessly and with such wit as Ethan and Joel Coen. 'The Big Lewboski' is an extremely smart film, but it doesn't shout ""look at me! Aren't I clever?"". It sucks you in from the get go, and bottom line it is FUNNY, and as it is a comedy that's what counts the most! Everything about the movie is perfect, the script, the direction, set design, costumes, and the wonderful soundtrack (one of the most brilliant ever assembled, it includes lesser known Dylan and Elvis Costello numbers, Creedence classics, and songs from cult favourites like Yma Sumac, Captain Beefheart, Moondog, Esquivel and garage gods The Monks). Plus of course the actors, who are well cast and virtually flawless. Jeff Bridges ('Fat City', 'Starman') IS The Dude, and it's impossible to think of anyone else acting the role. Coen regulars John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Peter Stomare, and Jon Polito are all on board, as well as Julianne Moore ('Boogie Nights'), David Huddleston ('Capricorn One'), Philip Seymour Hoffman ('Magnolia') and Sam Elliot ('Mask'), even surprise cameos from Ben Gazzara ('The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie') and singer Jimmie Ray Gilmore. I can't fault 'The Big Lebowski', it is one of the most original and entertaining comedies ever made and a genuine modern classic. It's movies like this that keep me watching despite the endless mountain of mindless garbage that Hollywood continually spews out. If only every movie in the box office Top Ten was as inspired and amusing as this one!",False

1,2,beautiful to look at but poorly thought out,rosedalebmc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although there are some interesting segments with good personality profiles, overall the documentary tries too hard to prove that interstellar travel is impossible, and slides into weak arguments that don't show what the director thinks they show. The last segment on religious cultists is especially out of place.",False
2,8,A sobering yet enlightening perspective on the hurdles of space exploration,pjames10,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed this video as it illuminates one of the key factors that throws a shadow over the technophiles dreams and desires to explore space. The fact is we aren't ready to even make the journey. Not just the lack of actual tech to take us to even the closest of planets a mere 4 light years away but as a species, as thinking animals we have not even moved past the limits of aggression and violence as revealed in ""the Russian experiment"" (no spoilers).Truth is, for all our aspirations, we are still a poor example of a higher life form and are only just entering anything close to intelligence (tech gadgets don't count. We might as well still be rubbing sticks together for fire). Deep space exploration is a whimsy, the fantasy for men who think they've accomplished something. Such hubris should be an embarrassment. We still have a lot of exploring to do... in the space between our ears.",False
3,8,Would have been ten stars if they'd left out the hokey religious crap at the end,adamchurvis,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThey did a good job on showing the obstacles standing in the way of an extra-galaxy migration to a new home planet, including the Russian study done decades ago. It looks like we're not going to make it all the way anywhere because enough people will go insane to hobble the mission, if not destroy the ship(s) entirely.Frankly I am surprised that Herzog showed that fake Brazilian ""Aliens of the Valley"" and their ""shake it while you fake it"" followers.Herzog actually narrated this:""The Aliens of the Valley are stuck on Earth. In the course of millennia their bodies have adapted to our environment, so there is no way back to their home planet. Watching them draw energy from outer space, we were mystified by the experience which seemed at times as perplexing as gazing at a faraway galaxy.""And then there were the Hawaiian male dancers doing their little tushy dance as an homage to the virgin land we supposedly spoiled when we built a massive telescope there to help us on our way to the future, because, hey, THAT is WAY more important than saving the Human Race, isn't it?That last twenty minutes of BS could have been better used.",True
4,10,Makes techno-utopians mad,de5troy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Despite what others have said about this film ""trying too hard to prove interstellar travel is impossible"", I thought they covered the ""pro-space travel"" researchers extensively and the people interviewed who cast doubt on the plausibility of some of these plans were all relevant experts (NASA engineer who worked on Mars rover, astronaut from the intl space station, head research at CERN, etc.).It wasn't so much about proving space travel is impossible but getting a fullsome look at the spectrum of researchers who look for solutions to the problems of space travel and those that work in related areas. People who are developing solutions for life on Mars or interstellar travel require funding, and that funding is tied to the utopian stories they tell about what they will achieve. The NASA guy or the CERN guy don't get funding by throwing cold water on these claims, their work just happens to give them certain relevant info regarding these potential space travel solutions.It is fun to imagine all the great possibilities of life as a miner on Mars, but the reality of 12x higher radiation and drinking recycled urine for generations is also a part of that dream.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys hard look documentaries with interesting and relevant interview subjects.Not surprisingly this film tends to make people who are bought into the contemporary techno-utopian fantasy of being an ""multi-planetary species"" a bit mad.",False
5,9,Great documentary,danielwest-63065,n/a,16/08/2025,"With its beautiful cinematography and interesting content, this documentary is an eye opening experience. Prior to watching, I was all for interplanetary travel however, I'm now sceptical. This film gives you a perspective that's not normally shown on pro interplanetary documentaries. I've not considered many of the elements covered in this film. Certainly worth a watch if you're interested in the subject.The soundtrack and visuals certainly add to the experience. There is an element of humour when discussing sex in space which breaks up the serious content throughout the rest of the film.Overall, definitely a good watch.",False
6,10,Very interesting and thoughtfully eye opening vision.,sch-63861,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stumbled upon this great movie the other day, never heard anything about it before and after watching it, was very surprised as to why this had not been given any kind of support to advertise it.It was a well thought out introspective on how we are as a human race to be able to travel into deep space.This is a must, really great 10 out of 10 watch for anyone!",False
7,8,Interesting,jeffdntx,n/a,16/08/2025,Interesting and thought provoking. I enjoyed the wide ranging ideas discussed and the relatively non-judgmental approach. The film was beautiful and technically well done.,False

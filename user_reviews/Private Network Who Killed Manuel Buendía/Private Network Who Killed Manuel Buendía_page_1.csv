1,8,Great investigative journalism,viscalcara,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great investigative journalism that deeps into the dark waters of corruption, capitalism, and drug trafficking alliance. The murder of Manuel Buendia shocked Mexican society at its core. Several journalists were interviewed to establish the character of Buendia. Might be difficult to follow by somebody who had no idea of who Kiki Camarena was and what his death meant for Mexicans.",False
2,6,"Interesting story, jumps around a lot",Calicodreamin,n/a,15/08/2025,"A heavy topic to try and cover in only 100 minutes, which unfortunately means the doc jumped around a lot and introduced about a hundred people. The central story was interesting, but unfortunately the scope was too wide.",False
3,1,Unwatchable,tosti35,n/a,15/08/2025,The background music they play while doing the interviews is louder than the people being interviewed. You can't barely hear what they are saying. The story of Buend√≠a is very interesting but is hard to follow since you can't hear a word they say.,False

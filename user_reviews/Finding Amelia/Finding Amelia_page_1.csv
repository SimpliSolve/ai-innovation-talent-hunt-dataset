1,3,Disappointing,antonthebear,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile much is promised and expectations are constantly kept high they don't find one scrap from Amelia's plane. This documentary should have been much shorter and let you know from the start that they never find anything connected to A. E.'s plane. The ""tense"" moment with the local PNG tribe was pure hype. There were some interesting facts about the Australian WW2 patrol that discovered a commercial plane and some video testimony.The lawyer supporting the expedition leader back in the US goes to completely absurd lengths to prove the validity of the WW2 map .I'm no Amelia Earheart expert but this doc. Left me very disappointed.",True
2,1,Faked,kirbyallman-71232,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis whole thing is just a remade extended version of the 2015 pilot episode of expedition unknown. Everything from the ""research "" and theories to the eyewitness is all the same from that tv show where they proved almost 10 years ago that without a doubt it was not her plane. There is even a scene about 20 minutes into the ""documentary "" where they stagee the meeting of some disconnected tribe, and make it seem as if it is going to be an unfriendly or deadly confrontation. That is exactly what expedition unknown did as well, and is unfair to that tribe. This is so trash and I don't know why HBO/MAX would remake something that a show on their own platform proved false almost a decade ago. Don't waste your time.",True
3,1,Pointless,davidlohr,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf this was an article we'd call it clickbait. At the beginning you're shown images of an aircraft wreck in the middle of a jungle. No context is given, but it's clearly suggested that they found something related to the disappearance of Amelia Earhart. They didn't. Obviously, if they had found something it would've made national news prior to the release of this garbage film. As it turned out, that wreckage was from a military aircraft. Something they don't bother to reveal until the end. Absolutely nothing is found related to Amelia Earhart's missing aircraft during this nearly two hour ""documentary."" What was the point? All that's shown is a map that may or may not have any relevance to anything. This was a pure cash grab.",True
4,1,Waste of time,pnbrzskry,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't even describe how bad this is and just garbage. Doesn't show anything new, just a fairy tale story. Glad I watched during a slow night at work and didn't waste my actual time. I'd be embarrassed to have been featured in this.On top that the acting is terrible and obviously staged every step of the way. Like the other review said ""clickbait"". And then they use it as a point to try and push feminist viewpoints. Yes she was ahead of her time but she was the one that pushed woman's rights forward. Please don't waste your time with this. I promise you will be heavily disappointed and regret it.",False
5,1,"Why do they keep doing these ""shows""?",Acro71,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this 100 minute ""show"" because of my job. Every second was painfull, as the presenter literally kept making things up as he went along.There is no actual evidence on anything that being presented. Every unsubstantiatedspeculation turns into a certainty that matches with the presenters ""theory"" about the plane backtracking and crashing to Papua N. Guinea.The most ""in your face"" mumbo jumbo?They find two holes side by side on solid rock, and the presenter decides that it is for sure ""an australian combat boot foot print that was petrified with time"".If it wasn't for making money out of a TV show, nobody in his right mind would start such an expedition to Papua N Guinea, because of a hunch and some vague or faked ""evidence"".Total waste of time, frustrating dialogues, totally unscientific claims and shenanigans.This content is intented for people that have no idea about how anything in the world works. Conspiracy theorist's galore.",False
6,10,The jungle is unreal,tamralea,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI really liked this documentary. Of course I find the search for her and her navigator Fred Noonan fascinating. It's a shame people are trash talking his expedition on IMDb because just hiking into this jungle is not for the faint of heart.It would be wonderful if they find it and it wouldn't surprise me if she had turned back and crashed in the brush. I find it amazing that an Australian military squad just happened onto it and it clearly meant something to them as well because they left video tapes about when they stumbled onto it in the jungle.I hope more people watch this because I would like to see more episodes on the search.,True
7,10,Great Research And Harkens To Michael Rockefeller's Disapearance in Jungle There,fasgroup,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're into famous disapearance stories, this one is a ""keeper"" (sad some other myopic, ADHD reviewers trash-talk this gem). Also if you've read the NYT Bestseller (and NYT's Editor's Choice) book of last 10 years called ""Savage Harvest"", about the 1961 disapearance of Michael Rockfeller there in Papau New Guinea (yes the son and granson heir to the Rockefeller fortune) and the tribal cannibalism of the jungle and disapearances, then this expedition will seem to be (and ""be"") all-too-real of the impossibilities of getting at the answers to Amelia. The basic premise that Carra (the expedition leader) works from, is that Amelia and Noonan always intended that after flying some hours, and a couple thousand miles, and ""not seeing the island"" (Howard Island) at first were not-to-ditch the aircraft and sink themselves, but rather to just turn-around to Papua, land, and try again. But alas, they crashed there in Papau. All other expeditions have been focused out at sea near Howard Island. And further to have first-hand evidence of a plane with Amelia's engine serial numbers in the jungle -- well, why not just focus there? But read ""Savage Harvest"" perhaps before this film docu and you'll see why getting answers out of this dark hole of unanswered questions is the last place on earth that anyone should have to look, for anyone or anything (whether Michael Rockefeller or Amelia Earhart or Fred Noonan or their plane) That jungle area makes the Bermuda Triangle look like a brightly lit room, compared to the shadowy abyss of the New Guinea jungles. Something gets lost there - don't plan on ever finding it. IMHO.",False

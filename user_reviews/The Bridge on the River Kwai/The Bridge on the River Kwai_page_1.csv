1,8,A movie about madness,Haplo-4,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have watched this movie several times and it is just getting better and better all the time. Why? Because this movie actually has a message built-in, this isn't a violent story, like ""Saving Private Ryan"" - also a good movie with a message - but it is still not a slow story.When I last saw it, I realised that there was something in the movie that I had never understood, this isn't a movie about war, torture or how it was to be a prisoner of war; this is a movie about madness and pride. The pride shows both in Saiko and Colonel Nicholson, they are so full of it that it is almost impossible for them to come to a civil-conclusion with the problems they have with each other. The madness is shown in Colonel Nicholson and Holden's character - here they are, two prisoners of war and they don't want to help each other out, instead they try to reach separate goals, and they are both willing to die for it.After you have watched this movie one is amazed by the performances made by Alec Guinness and William Holden and I must say that this is therefore one of the best War/Drama movies ever made My vote? 9 out of 10 naturally.",False
2,8,"""It's a matter of principle"" - timeless direction by David Lean",calspers,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is a prinoner-of-war drama at its best, masterfully directed by David Lean.Amazing direction, and the whole approach to making this film is timeless - a study in being ahead of its time. Stunning set pieces and production design - such and effort was put into this. Fantastic cinematography, filled to the brim with pitch-perfect pans, wide-shots, and tracking-shots. Intense and dramatic score, deservedly receiving one of the total of seven Academy Awards. Brilliant cast and in particular Alec Guinness, who perfectly portrays a man of honour.What is a big shame is the way Colonel Philip Toosey - the original colonel, portrayed through Nicholson - was misrepresented, in that he actually acted very differently and much more courageously than in the film.Nonetheless, as a look into the historic event that took place in 1943 Burma, it is absolutely brilliant, and although the film does not carry loads of emotional moments, it is technically excellent, and greatly entertaining.Highly recommended.",False
3,9,"""This is not a game of cricket""",Steffi_P,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Bridge on the River Kwai – David Lean's first epic, a genre he would later be associated with more than any other. Previously having made his mark as a director of deep and often psychological dramas, Lean's easy transition into bigger pictures reflects the change that was taking place in the genre itself, moving from the grandiose spectacle of De Mille et al, towards the ""intimate"" epic of the late 50s and early 60s.We are also here seeing the development of the war, or rather, the anti-war picture. Prior to this most anti-war or anti-military pictures were small-scale dramas, whereas all the big war films were rousing flag wavers. Bridge on the River Kwai ticks both boxes, and is all the more effective for it. It is an anti-war film which prevents itself from becoming static or preachy, and an action film with a humanist edge.The problem presented to David Lean, aside from the fact that he had never done anything on this scale before, is that Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman's multi-layered screenplay contains many different strands, with stories told from multiple points of view. Lean fortunately had dealt with such fragmentary narratives before – 1952's The Sound Barrier for example – and here he actually uses the trappings of the epic to keep the narrative focused. This was the first time he had used the cinemascope aspect ratio, but rather than employing it purely to show off the stunning landscapes (although he does do a fair bit of that too, and why not?) he also uses the width of the screen to cram varying elements into the frame. For example, in the scene where Nicholson (Alec Guinness) surveys the railway construction with his fellow officers, the figure of Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) can be seen on a hill in the background. This reminds us of his presence, and subtly keeps his story arc going.Lean's use of colour is also remarkable. Of course, when your film is set in a PoW camp in the middle of a jungle, you have a fairly limited colour palette anyway, but Lean's crafty choice of camera angle and positioning is calculated to show off different tones at different times. In the opening moments, highly reminiscent of The African Queen (which, like Kwai, was produced by Sam Spiegel) he begins with the greens of the jungle – a fairly cold colour. As we descend through the trees, Lean gradually turns up the heat with those dusty yellows and browns. For the middle section of the film, he cools things off again with more lush greens and even some vibrant shades, before returning to the stark hot tones for the tense finale. Again, this is all very subtle director's work, but these touches do create little shifts in mood and influence the way we view each scene.Lean's handling of the larger canvas was however not yet quite up to best showing off his actors upon it. That's a shame with such a good cast, although Alec Guinness in one of his earliest non-comedic roles shone through enough to garner an Oscar. William Holden was also deserving of at least a nomination, but didn't get one. To my mind though the best performance of the picture was that of Sessue Hayakawa. Hayakawa was an incredibly powerful silent film actor – check him out in De Mille's The Cheat (1915) – and it's great to see him at the top of his game again here.Bombarded with awards, Bridge on the River Kwai is typical Oscar-winning fare, particularly for the conflicted political climate of the 1950s. It can be read as a damning critique of war, but also enjoyed as a gripping action film. This broad appeal, the depth of the screenplay and Lean's assured direction made it a hit in its day and allowed its popularity to endure in the generations since.",False
4,10,Still Stirring Wartime Adventure and Compelling Psychological Drama Exhibit David Lean at His Peak,EUyeshima,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter years of more intimate British films and just discovering the joys of location shooting with 1955's ""Summertime"", master director David Lean made his first actual widescreen epic with 1957's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", an acknowledged classic that deserves attention from a new generation of viewers and another visit from the rest of us who love perfectly executed films by an unparalleled craftsman. Recently, this movie has been overshadowed by his 1962 follow-up epic, the comparatively more elaborate ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but this richly textured WWII-set adventure is special enough on its own terms. While it has its share of action and suspense presented in exacting detail, the film is even more resonant as a psychological drama about the test of wills between mission-driven officers amid the perils of wartime survival.The plot takes place in 1943 when after surrendering in Singapore, Col. Nicholson marches his ragged British company into a Japanese prisoner work camp in the Burmese jungle (this is where the famous whistling of ""Colonel Bogey March"" is first heard). The erudite Col. Saito runs the camp and demands that the new prisoners build a massive railway bridge, a critical juncture between Rangoon and Malaysia. In a classic stand-off, Nicholson finally forces Saito to respect Geneva Convention and not allow his officers to do manual labor on the construction. Upon his ironic Pyrrhic victory, Nicholson slowly descends into the madness of seeing the completed bridge as a potential morale booster for his battle-weary men. Meanwhile, shortly after Nicholson's arrival, U.S. Navy Cmdr. Shears escapes from the camp only to be later blackmailed into joining a British commando mission led by do-or-die Maj. Warden and hesitant Lt. Joyce with the sole goal of blowing up the bridge. Through Peter Taylor's thoughtful film editing, the movie breathlessly alternates between the parallel story lines of the bridge construction and the jungle commando mission until the exciting climax.Lean's accomplishments are many with this memorable film - the authenticity of the Burmese jungle locations (filmed in Sri Lanka), the seamless integration of the two story lines, the masterful handing of the final scenes, and in particular, the gradual metamorphosis of Nicholson from a by-the-book British officer to Saito's willing collaborator. A frequent participant in Lean's films, Alec Guinness gives his career-best performance as Nicholson providing all sorts of unexpected shades to his complex characterization. As Shears, William Holden does what he did best in the 1950's, concurrently exude natural bravado and a conflicted soul and then added a layer of cynicism that dares to challenge the viewer to support him. The 68-year old Sessue Hayakawa came out of retirement to play Saito and delivers a subtle performance of unbending discipline and pained humiliation. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne lend sturdy support as Warden and Joyce respectively. With the same expert eye he lent to ""Summertime"", Jack Hildyard provides the superbly expressive and composed cinematography. Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, both blacklisted at the time, wrote the brilliantly developed screenplay. This is essential viewing.The two-disc 2000 Limited Edition DVD set has a pristine print transfer with great sound making the entire experience feel surprisingly fresh upon viewing. There is a nearly hour-long documentary on Disc Two, ""The Making of The Bridge on the River Kwai"", produced for the DVD and full of intriguing insight into the production logistics. There are a couple of shorter featurettes produced around the time of the film's original release, the first is a black-and-white teaser for the film itself and the second a rather pedestrian lesson in Film 101 produced by USC grad students and introduced by Holden. Director John Milius provides a respectful tribute to the film in another short.",True
5,10,They don't make movies like this anymore.,bat-5,n/a,15/08/2025,"I recently saw The Bridge on the River Kwai at the Cinerama Dome, and it was quite spectacular.  Unlike some of today's grand adventure films, you get to know the characters along with seeing great scenes of acting and cinematography.  Alec Guinness is at the top of his form as the single minded Colonel Nicholson.  The scene between Nicholson and Saito in Saito's hut is remarkable.  Nicholson still will not concede defeat, he even takes offense that other officers of different armies gave in and worked alongside the enlisted men.  Saito can't understand Nicholson's acceptance of his punishment, and it drives him crazy.  The film's plot has two stories that are beautifully intertwined.  Shears' return to the bridge is his only way to escape the bridge.  In the film's final act, the tension is turned up as the British commandos try to blow up the bridge, and a train, and only then does Nicholson realise what the bridge really is.  The Bridge on the River Kwai is one film that is hard to top, the only film able to do that is Lawrence of Arabia, both directed by the meticulous eye of David Lean.  One director who could put intimacy in epic circumstances.",False
6,n/a,Nothing less than a masterpiece...,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"About as Oscar-worthy as any film made in the '50s is David Lean's gripping BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Based loosely on a real-life incident, it tells the story of an imprisoned British officer (Alec Guinness) who loses sight of his mission when forced to build a bridge for the Japanese that will enable the enemy to carry supplies by train through the jungle during World War II. Guinness plays the crisp British officer to perfection, brilliant in all of his scenes but especially in his confrontations with Sessue Hayakawa. William Holden has a pivotal role as one of the prisoners who escapes and enjoys his freedom for awhile before being asked to return with a small squadron to destroy the bridge. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne have colorful roles too and all are superb under David Lean's direction.The jungle settings filmed in Ceylon add the necessary realism to the project and there is never a suspension of interest although the story runs well over two-and-a-half hours. The film builds to a tense and magnificent climax with an ending that seems to be deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking. Well worth watching, especially if shown in the restored letterbox version now being shown on TCM.Some of the best lines go to William Holden and he makes the most of a complex role--a mixture of cynicism and heroism in a character that ranks with his best anti-hero roles in films of the '50s. He brings as much conviction to his role as Alec Guinness does and deserved a Best Actor nomination that he did not get.",False
7,10,A powerful film experience,Wormtongue1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I heard a film critic once say that there really aren't ""war movies""; there are only ""anti-war"" movies.  I'm still not sure what I think of that claim, but having seen - The Bridge on the River Kwai- enough times in the past several years, I think I'm persuaded that it's at least half right.  -Kwai-, I believe, is both a ""war"" and ""anti-war"" movie, and, in my view, it succeeds admirably at both.There is almost no element of -Kwai- that is not praise-worthy.  David Lean's direction is tight and evocative.  The cinematography is great (even though the color seems increasingly drained in film versions that I have seen).  The acting is top-notch.  I honestly believe that this is Alec Guiness's best performance, and Sessue Hayakawa is also highly sympathetic and believable.  William Holden and Jack Hawkins round out the cast nicely.The musical score is also right on.  Simply put, -Kwai- is an excellently constructed film made by people who obviously cared a great deal about it. As a result, the viewer comes to care a great deal about it as well.Clearly -Kwai- is an anti-war film.  There is no glorification here.  War is brutal, period.  It's brutality is not captured here in terms of gory carnage or senseless battles.  Instead, the psychological dimension of brutality comes across clearly.  Yet, -Kwai- also shows the resilience of the human spirit as well as its complexity.  One is left wondering if participation in World War II not only psychologically brutalized the characters played by Guiness, Hayakawa, and Holden but also if it simultaneously uplifted them.  The paradox is striking to me each time I view this film.  War can act both as a positive and negative catalyst, and it can do both of these things at the same instant.So, is -The Bridge on the River Kwai- a war movie or an anti-war movie?  I think Lean clearly preferred the latter, but the subject matter and his approach to it may have landed somewhere in between.Regardless,  -Kwai- is a fantastic film experience and is not to be missed. It is, simply put, my very favorite film--bar none.",False
8,10,The Definitive Guinness Performance,jhclues,n/a,15/08/2025,"Within the Conflict that was World War II, there were many more smaller, more personal conflicts which, when added up, made a significant impact on the outcome of the War; though trying to explain them, or war in general, is like attempting to decipher the indecipherable.  In `The Bridge On the River Kwai,' director David Lean takes you deep into the Burmese jungle to examine some of these deeper conflicts, and the effects of extraordinary circumstances on some ordinary men:  British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is a man of rigid principles and ideals, to whom acquiescence in any quarter is not an option; Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) lives by an inflexible code of conduct and is adamant in his adherence to it, through which he maintains his dignity and honor; American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden) just wants to make it through the war alive and get back home.As an integral part of their war effort, the Japanese have ordered a strategic bridge to be built across the Kwai River to facilitate the transport of troops and equipment.  This monumental task has been given to Saito, the commandant of an allied prisoners-of-war camp; and not only must he build it, it must be completed by a specific date.  And time is short. Toward that end, Saito has pressed into service every prisoner, including officers, whom according to the Geneva Convention of 1864 (which established rules for the humane treatment of prisoners of war), are to be excluded from any manual labor.  When a fresh contingent of British prisoners arrives to bolster his complement of workers, Saito finds himself up against a formidable opponent, Nicholson, who immediately informs Saito that his officers will not work, in accordance with the rules of the Geneva Convention.  And it's the beginning of another war-- a war of wills-- between two men determined to win at any cost.  To Saito, this is more than just another assignment, it's an obligation, and failure is not an option. If he does not succeed in having the bridge built-- and on time-- he will be forced to take his own life, in accordance with his own moral code. Nicholson, on the other hand, is unyielding to the point of madness, and will die before he accedes to Saito's demands.Meanwhile Shears has managed by some miracle to escape and has made his way back to Ceylon.  And he's home free-- after some recuperation time at Mount Lavinia Hospital, he'll be on his way back to the states.  Or so he thinks. But unbeknownst to him, the British are aware of the bridge being built on the Kwai, and are planning a commando raid to destroy it.  And Shears has something they need:  First hand knowledge of the precise location, and of the jungle through which he made his miraculous escape.  Subsequently, the Navy agrees to `loan' Shears to the British, to aid them with their mission. So instead of a ticket home, Shears is faced with another arduous trek through an uncompromising jungle, all for a mission of which the odds against success are nearly incalculable.From the beginning of the film to it's spectacular climax, Lean builds and maintains a subtle tension that underscores the drama, which makes this a compelling, unforgettable motion picture.  Lean is the Master of epic films such as this, filling them with sweeping visuals while integrating them with the emotional involvement of his characters perfectly.  Lean knows what he wants and how to get it, and he takes a terrific story (and this definitely is one) and tells it by using every bit of space--visually and audibly-- at this disposal.  And most importantly, he knows how to get the kind of performances from his actors to put it all across so convincingly and believably.Alec Guinness deservedly received the Oscar for Best Actor for his role of Nicholson, whom he embodies from the inside out, disappearing so utterly into the character that the actor is forgotten, leaving nothing but the real man in his stead.  It's a superlative piece of acting from one of the truly great actors of all times.  Holden, as well, delivers an outstanding performance as Shears, capturing that somewhat embittered, off-handed sarcasm and resignation of a man trapped by circumstances beyond his control, who nevertheless does what he can to make the most of it, while awaiting the first opportunity for escape that affords itself.  Holden's work here is Award-worthy, as well, but was destined to forever remain in the shadows of what is probably the definitive Guinness performance.  And what a rare treat, having two performances of this caliber in a single film.Other notable performances include Hayakawa, entirely convincing as the tormented Saito, and Jack Hawkins, as demolition expert Major Warden, the absolute personification of the undaunted British stiff-upper-lip.The supporting cast includes James Donald (Clipton), Geoffrey Horne (Joyce), Percy Herbert (Grogan), Ann Sears (Nurse) and Andre Morell (Green). Beautifully filmed and expertly crafted and delivered, `The Bridge On the River Kwai' is one of David Lean's masterpieces.  It's an emotionally involving, dramatic action/adventure that offers some real insight into the determination and tenacity of the human spirit.  This film (especially the ending) is one you will never forget; a classic in every sense of the word, it exemplifies the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",False
9,9,Far Ahead of Its Time,Sickfrog,n/a,15/08/2025,"First off, what is so amazing about this film is that, for the time that it was made, how modern it looks. David Lean certainly had the eye of any modern director and managed to direct a visual masterpiece at a time when many films were still being shot in black and white.William Holden gives one of his finest performances as a cynic of warfare , citing for us the insanity and absurdity that the combatants often convey. And he hates the war, but he cannot avoid been thrown back into it again and again. We wish he could stay on the beach with his nurse lover, but he is a man destined for a tragic doom for his country, whether he wants to or not.Alec Guiness also delivers a fine performance as a bold general whose own pride is, at the same time, his most noble quality as well as his greatest fault. He is uncompromising, yet when the Japanese submit to his demands, he begins overseeing the construction of the bridge with great esteem. Eventually, for him, the bridge becomes a manifestation of his belief of the superiority of the British Army, which he follows like a religion. And in putting all his pride into this bridge, he loses sight of even the British's own true agenda. Truly, his sense of overwhelming honor is, at the same time, his downfall in a descent to a loss of morality, and a sense of good and evil.And yes, by the end of this film, we learn a great lesson of the horrors of war. Not only does it take the lives of many good men, but the utter failure and despair that accompany it make it an unbearable existence. And this message has only recently been re-evaluated with the also-brilliant masterpiece ""Saving Private Ryan."" But, keep in mind that it took forty years to regain the power that this film inspired so long ago.",False

11,6,"Good film, but a travesty of history",gcaplan,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am normally an admirer of David Lean. But it is difficult to understand why he chose to base this film on a real event at the River Kwai, as it grossly misrepresents the real ""Colonel Nicholson"" and caused considerable distress to both him and the River Kwai veterans.The Colonel Nicholson character is based on the allied camp commander, Lieutenant Colonel Philip Toosey, who was a remarkable officer by any standards.Awarded the DSO for heroism during the defence of Singapore, he refused an order to join the evacuation so he could remain with his men during captivity. In the hellish conditions of the camp, he worked courageously to ensure that as many of his men as possible would survive. He endured regular beatings when he complained of ill-treatment of prisoners, but as a skilled negotiator he was able to win many concessions from the Japanese by convincing them that this would speed the completion of the work. Behind their backs, however, he did everything possible to delay and sabotage the construction without endangering his men, and also helped organise a daring escape, at considerable cost to himself. For his conduct in the camp, he won the undying respect of his men.After the war, he showed great generosity of spirit by saving the life of Colonel Saito, second in command at the camp and a relatively decent officer, when he spoke up for him at the war crimes tribunal. He worked for the veterans all his life, and became President of the National Federation of Far Eastern Prisoners of War.He refused repeated requests by the veterans to speak out against the film, being much too modest to seek any glory or recognition for himself. However you will find his achievements documented in a book by Professor Peter Davies entitled ""The Man Behind the Bridge"".Toosey hoped that no one watching the film would believe a British Army officer could be so stupid in real life. But with the film being rated on this site as one of the top 50 movies of all time, this hope may have been misplaced. Enjoy the film by all means as a work of fiction, but it is surely important to set the record straight and recognise the heroism of the real man involved.",False

It entertained me when I saw in the theater as a 12- year-old as years later as a 50-something-year-old seeing it on DVD. I say this to encourage younger people to check this film out, and give it a chance.Anyone who is fascinated with character studies might find this particularly interesting with Alec Guiness' role in here as Colonel Nicholson.

The massive flock of birds scattering during a surprise encounter with the enemy was my favorite.Dramatic climax. You have to suspend disbelief a bit, but it's gripping, suspenseful, and well-told.Alec Guinness. Brilliant character, brilliant acting. His scene walking stiffly out of the hot box is fantastic.The theme of maniacal devotion to duty blinding one to what's right. Obviously in Guinness's character, and in a minor key, the leader of the commando force (Jack Hawkins).The whistling of the 'Colonel Bogey March.' A little crazy, but catchy. Also perfectly symbolic of the above two items.Sessue Hayakawa. Just seeing the legend at age 71 was great and he has some nice early scenes, but it's too bad his character was so limited (part of the lowlights).The context. It sits at an interesting crossroads between highly patriotic work of the 1940's, and deeper satire of military madness (e.g. Catch-22) and the disillusionment of the 1960's. Aside from the leaders being a bit off-kilter, one young solider says ""I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime,"" and it's clear the escaped American (William Holden) wants no part of further battle.Lowlights:Treatment of the Japanese. They're shown as incompetent at building bridges, and weak at controlling the prisoners. It's remarkable how little the Japanese are present in the film. Also remarkable is how much control the British commander has in his interactions with them, and in just strolling around. In one scene, Hayakawa privately weeps in frustration. These things are simply ludicrous and seem to me to stem from feelings of racial superiority.Overall lightness of tone. After the opening scenes it's almost a cartoon, and I think it did the real-life POW's and civilians who worked under horrific conditions a real disservice.William Holden's character. He's the cool American who enjoys seeing a woman after escaping, hanging out in loafers, and acting in ways that are decidedly un-military. On the trek through the jungle on the daring mission, he's soaped and shampooed in a natural pool by a lovely young Thai woman, one of several who are (of course!) helping carry the gear.

14,5,Unrealistic Hollywood style cartoon,mim-8,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have a deep admiration for David Lean as the director who pushed the boundaries of film making far beyond, and set the marker not only in technical aspects of the craft, but often in atmosphere and feel of the film. His movies are beautiful to watch and that's why sometimes we can't see how bad the cake tastes from all the icing and decorations. ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is like that, sticky sweet but ultimately nauseating. Every time a movie parts from reality we observe a genre, and the intention of film maker, along with symbolism it's trying to project. War movies in particular have to be true to the bone (unless they're parodies) because they represent the bestiality of mankind, and duality of man. This film tried to portray those essential elements but fell into Hollywood blender and came out silly and unrealistic.First and foremost, anybody who even remotely knows anything about Japanese tradition, military culture social and military codes and character of Japanese man, can only laugh at pitiful Colonel Saito who is not only without any remorselessness, but looks like a powerless teacher on the first day in a new school, being played like a flute by honorable Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness),who not only survives days, locked in a tin box in tropical heat and humidity, but wins every concession for his troops he can think of, making the poor Colonel Saito cry at the end of one of his parades of will?!? Japanese soldiers and camp commanders were ""very well known"" for their compassion, sensitivity and sensibility which was expressed many times during the war, especially in Wake Island massacre, Manila massacre and Bataan Death March, so even the hint of Colonel Nicholson's behavior would result in quick decapitation. William Holden with his tanned biceps glowing in the sun is a true picture of starved Japanese prisoner, and his escape, along with return through the jungle in 50's style loafers (observe the scene where he and his band of sturdy man are being washed by Burmese women prior to attacking the bridge), is down right preposterous. Building a bridge as a monument to his ego is possible way of expression for ""open only in a case of war"" type of character Col. Nicholson apparently is, but convincing other prisoners to join in that venture simply on ""let's show 'em"" premise, in those times and circumstances is not likely to happen. To complete the three-ring circus, Japanese soldiers show solidarity and play along, so at the end you're not sure what did you just see. The battle of wills, winner makes history film, anti-war film, or simply a Hollywood action movie/spectacle without any plausibility or logic? Judge for yourself. Oh, and 5 stars are only for cinematography and Holden's loafers.",True
15,n/a,"A true classic, despite one disturbing aspect",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"In my opinion, David Lean is one of the cinema's greatest directors, in the highest pantheon along with the likes of Kurosawa, Welles, De Sica, and Bergman. Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and his vastly underrated ""A Passage to India"" are unmitigated masterpieces, and some of his 'smaller' films, such as ""Summertime,"" ""Great Expectations,"" and ""Brief Encounter"" are true gems.""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" should justly be grouped with ""Lawrence"" and ""India,"" as all three are sweeping in scope, and all three are some of the most thematically ambitious films ever made, reflecting a mature filmmaker at the peak of his craft. Like ""Lawrence,"" ""Kwai"" does not flinch for a moment while it forces the viewer to gaze deep into the chasm of the human condition, and it is not an easy film to take in, as it presents us with profoundly symbolic (archetypal, you might say) character types, most of whom elicit both admiration and repulsion, sympathy and frustration. And while the film explores these character themes at length, it is ultimately content to leave the conflicts unresolved, happy simply to present us with the Hamlet-like paradoxes that are the human condition in all its glory and stupidity.If there is any clear, unequivocal message that can be gleaned from ""Kwai,"" it is an ode in praise of stoic virtue and the struggle for dignity and meaning in the face of a hostile universe-- in this case, in the face of an inhuman and absurd war. However, ironically, it is in this very aspect that the film, in my opinion, has its greatest failing. In retrospect, it would seem that in order to distill the film's philosophical elements down to universal themes, and perhaps in order to make the story palatable to 1950s audiences (and more Oscar-worthy?), the film greatly tones down the very inhumanity of the historical situation it portrays. In reality, the Japanese were perfectly capable of engineering their own bridges and, far more importantly, the building of the Burma-Thailand Railroad was an atrocity so vast and inhuman that it can only be rightly compared with the Nazi Holocaust and the Khmer Rouge Genocide. The true ""stiff upper lip"" displayed by the surviving prisoners-of-war from that hell in the jungle was not an insistence that a bridge be built right if it is to be built at all, etc.; the true ""stiff upper lip"" was mere survival itself, as thousands upon thousands were dying of starvation, overwork, constant beatings, summary executions, disease and exposure. While it is true that not every film about war needs to be ""Shoah,"" ""Schindler's List,"" or ""The Killing Fields,"" and ""Kwai"" should be viewed on its own terms, as a film solely about the themes and characters it has chosen to depict; nevertheless, by so greatly downplaying the horrors of the actual historical situation it portrays, the film ultimately does a great disservice to the hundreds of thousands of people of several nationalities who suffered and died in the building of this monstrosity of a railroad. While it seems to me that the intentions of the filmmakers were noble, that Lean sought to explore the struggle of the human spirit under the greatest adversity, the film's light treatment of the still-seldom-discussed topic of Japanese war crimes inadvertently trivializes that very struggle.Nonetheless, I still feel that ""Kwai"" is an amazing cinematic achievement in its own right. And while it would only be with heavy reservation that I place it on a list of ""greatest films,"" it does manage to squeak onto my hypothetical Top 100.",False
16,10,David Lean's incredible masterpiece.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"A group of British soldiers arrive in a Japanese prisoner of war camp, led by Colonel Nicholson, their captors order them to build a bridge linking Burma to Siam.Having recently been wowed by Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on The River Kwai seemed like the next logical choice, it's been some time since I last watched it, and the memory I have going in, is that it's a masterpiece.I wonder if David Lean realised what he'd created when he completed this film, a timeless classic, a film for the ages.I know it's a film, but wow do you get a sense of what those poor men must have suffered, prisoners in the hands of a cruel bunch of captors, with no regard for international rule.Incredibly well made, a production of epic proportions that holds up perfectly to this day, amazing location work, costumes, and sets, and remember there were no special effects to rely on in 1957.So many scenes are incredible, so it's hard to highlight one, however the scene that had me hugely absorbed was that incredible moment where Nicholson and Colonel Saito try to come to an agreement about work on the bridge over a glass of Johnny Walker red label.Sir Alec Guinness gives arguably his finest ever performance, and let's be honest, he delivered countless masterclasses. His delivery and actions are incredible, Nicholson is tough, rigid, determined, proper and loaded with a sense of duty.What is fascinating to contemplate is Nicholson's real motive for choosing to convince the men to work, was it to keep them occupied, or for other reasons, such as a legacy to be admired, interesting.Amazing cast, William Holden, Jack Hawkins, Sessue Hayakawa, everyone plays their part.It's virtually perfect, 10/10.",False
17,9,Tension-building,melindaparkes,n/a,15/08/2025,"At first, the stretched out first half of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. felt like a flaw, but the movie's second half made me reconsider this. The plot shifts focus, and concentrates on an escaped Prisoner Of War, who fled from the camp and becomes part of a team sent back in to go and blow up the bridge. Suddenly, during the part of his recovery at a military hospital, the screenplay injects quite a bit of humor (the conversation between Warden and his superior officers about him not receiving parachute-training was a wonderful highlight) and from then on, when their mission starts, the film gets much more exciting. It made me appreciate the first hour more for the establishing reasons it was used for, and also because - to my surprise - the shifting in tone and pace worked wonders.There's so much you could go into if you're looking to praise this film. Needless to mention what a fine performance Alec Guinness and other cast members gave, so I'll just point out how impressed I was when I saw the movie's climax. They way the script builds up to it, is one thing. Taking the time to lay out a strategy and incorporating the notion that this whole mission might even go terribly wrong at one point, successfully increases tension during those final scenes. But the fact that the filmmakers completely destroyed a real bridge and a real train...? No use of miniatures or other special effects. Now which movies made today would actually have the courage to show us something like that? Simply none. Those days are over.The only thing I would have preferred, is having seen the first half of the film injected with a slightly more grim mood, because frankly, that cheerful (and very famous) whistle-tune of the prisoners and some of the fanfare-esquire parts of the musical score got on my nerves a bit. I'll just blame that on the fact that this foremost still is a Hollywood movie. And that's just the way anyone will have to take this film, regardless it was based on (and altered) real facts of war.",False
18,10,"A Great Movie, terrific performances from Alec Guinness, William Holden and Sessui Hayakawa",markjayaweera,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWonderful film. The three main characters were played by Alec Guinness, William Holden and Sessui Hayakawa who give some of the best performances of their careers. The interplay between the Japanese Commander and the British commander was especially terrific. Both Alec Guinness and Hayakawa put in superb acting performances which is what makes this such a great film. At the end of the movie both of them discover they are both not so different after from one imperialist country Britain and one from the other Japan. Both fighting for their causes which in their own way turn out to be not so different. Both consumed by the madness of war and have become mad themselves. The only sane individuals was the American played by William Holden who wanted out of WW2 and who was quite funny and provided comic relief in the movie at his disapproval of the British and Japanese commanders, and William Holden character only wanted to return back to his home in America for he has seen enough of the war, and the British Doctor at the camp who has seen enough too. Just a great film showing the madness,brutality and inhumanity and futility of war. The theme of the movie can be summed up by the British Doctor at the end. When he says ""Madness Madness"". Meaning not just the political leaders are mad but the people who follow them into war are equally mad. In my opinnion one of the best films I've seen.",True
19,10,Ageless and all but perfect,Spleen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Of all war movies this is the one with the best idea behind it.  Think how easy it is to make a bad war movie.  A group of people must blow up a bridge, and this is the story of their quest ...  Actually, that DID serve as the premise for a film: it was called `Force Ten from Navarone', and it was dire.  Or how about this one: we see close up the brutalities of war. (Then we see them again.  Then we see some more of the brutalities of war. Then we see the credits.)  Or how about this: a humble American soldier, with the pragmatism native to his breed, rejects his superiors' highfalutin talk of honour and glory and asserts his basic humanity in trying to stay alive.  Or this one: we see English prisoners of war maintain their dignity in the face of Japanese brutality.They're all present, in a sort of a way: but ALSO present is a magnificent, long, suspenseful, tight story, around which these apparent clichés wrap naturally.  If the clichés don't wrap naturally then they, not the story, are bent out of shape.  Just when we think that the American pragmatist will turn out to be the hero, we see him cut a rather shabby figure, and it seems that there really WAS something to that highfalutin talk of honour and glory, after all.  But then we discover that he has standards of his own, and they appear to be better ones.  But THEN it seems that ...  I could go on indefinitely, since there are many people here with something to be said for them, and it requires some thought to see who has the most to be said for him in the end.There's almost no need to mention the excellent performances, photography and music.  The only thing one might have qualms about is historical accuracy.  Nothing like this ever happened.  Still, that makes the movie much less dishonest than those that base themselves on historical events, and then proceed to get them all wrong.  You can only be misled by `The Bridge on the River Kwai' if you don't know that it's pure fiction.  Well - you know now.",False
20,9,A David Lean War Movie !,Umar Mansoor Bajwa,n/a,15/08/2025,"The story is well laden with excitement, thrill and adventure. The characterization of different roles is uniquely perfect. The intrinsic conflicts, valor and stoic fortitude displayed by Col. Nicholson played by Alec Guinness is indeed commendable. Needless to mention is the daredevil nature of the commando action steered by a British Major to blow the bridge, laboriously built by another British Colonel is a striking coincidence. However, tragedy awaited Shears (William Holden) the US Navy Officer who had earlier miraculously escaped from the POW camp run by an intransigent Col. Saitu.Above all is the magnificent direction of Sir David Lean, who has captured marvelous locations for filming the army offices and bungalows situated at uniquely picturesque spots. It requires a keen eye to identify the meticulous details of the sets, like the revolving pedestal fan and wartime furniture, when Major Warden convinces Shears to join the death defying plot. The screenplay is a feast for the eyes. The dialogues and script goes hand in hand with the majestic flow of thrill in this commando mission movie.A must see for all war movie buffs.",False
21,10,"""Madness, Madness""",theowinthrop,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLet's face it - war is organized madness, and although the stakes in World War II were tremendous for whichever side lost, the individual effects of the war on the men and nations involved caused madness on several levels.Pierre Boule's short novel brilliantly discusses the madness in the crazy situation that sweeps up Colonels Nicholson and Saito. Under normal circumstances, the two men might never had been friends but they might have had a degree of respect for each other. Both come from nations that have long histories and traditions, and whose officer corps prided themselves on leadership and withstanding privations. The Japanese formalized these traditions in the code of Bushido (which was twisted, unfortunately, in World War II). It included sharing privation with one's men and was similar to the concept of noblesse oblige that the aristocratic officers of Britain's army tried to maintain. Nicholson's stoicism when put into the isolation box was as much in his tradition as Saito's tradition would have included willingly reducing his own share of his rations for the benefit of his men in a siege.The situation that develops is a racial rivalry. The Japanese, in 1943, have won so many of the campaigns, and witnessed the surrender of Allied (i.e. Western - American, British, French, Dutch troops) that they really have a contempt for them. As we now know was true, the Japanese soldiers frequently fought to the last man (think of Saipan and Okinawa in the last stages of the war, where flame throwers were frequently used to force Japanese soldiers and civilians out into the open). Westerners could do this too, but traditionally the western states saw no shame in surrendering after putting up a hard fight. Not so the Japanese military.Saito is identifying with this tradition. In the novel, he is also disappointed that he is in charge of a prisoner of war camp - he'd prefer to be back in the fighting. But they need the prisoners to build the railroads throughout the new Japanese empire (as mentioned on another comment, the ""Greater East Asiatic Co-Prosperity Sphere"") that can have men and material race from one end of the empire to the other.In reality this frequently ended up more like slave labor than what Boule arranges (or what Saito probably had in mind). Nicholson insists on treatment under the Geneva convention for P.O.W.s, but Saito thinks it's typically Western and wimpish. As punishment for his presumption he puts Nicholson in a hellish underground cell in solitary. But Nicholson's men refuse to cooperate until he's released, and when he is he sneers at the Japanese engineers and their mistakes, and insists on the English army engineers taking control of the building - and this works well for the Japanese Army but not for Saito, who seriously feels like he has lost face and should commit suicide.Director David Lean wisely shot the film on location, capturing the heat and disorientation of a humid jungle war front. His wide screen film manages to make the locale of the prison camp and the Kwai River (and the bridge) look like it is the entire world, and that escape is impossible from it (indeed the one man who escapes - Holden - has to return eventually).The novel does not include the character played by William Holden, one of his typically laconic Americans who retain a clear sightedness when compared to the British. Holden's ""Shears"" sees the prison camp as a massive graveyard (he's on the burial detail) and hates it to the point of escaping. He reaches safety in a recovery hospital in Ceylon, but he's forced by Jack Hawkins to return to the campsite to destroy the bridge.Hawkins' too seems a realist - he is trying to destroy an enemy target that is nearly completed, and will make the enemy's war effort far easier. But his resolve to do this involves blackmailing Holden into assisting him, and forcing himself to continue on his mission after being seriously injured. At the end the mission kills hundreds of men. Hawkins has succeeded, but the local natives who assisted him look at him like he is a mass murderer.Guinness' Nicholson is one of the most myopic soldiers in film (or fiction for that matter) totally forgetting the purpose of himself and his soldiers even in a P.O.W. situation but thinking solely in terms of oneupmanship and morale. It was a splendid performance. One might make a case that he behaved like a man who was hallucinating after an illness, and indeed he does (accidentally) get back to reality at the eleventh hour - too late to save himself, but in time to save his military honor.Sessue Hayakawa had a film career in Hollywood that went back to the silent period (even appearing opposite Gloria Swanson in a Cecil B. DeMille movie), but the coming of sound and the deterioration of Japanese-American relations caused him to leave American movies. Like Swanson's sound comeback in Wilder's SUNSET BLVD., Hayakawa's appearance as Saito, a harsh foe but ultimately sympathetic given his code of behavior and how he is humiliated, brought him belated recognition and an Oscar nomination.Finally there is James Douglas, a highly useful, plain looking British actor who frequently brought dollops of common sense to his films. His P.O.W. Major Clipton tries to rouse Nicholson's sense of reality, but fails (in fact he soon sees that Nicholson's unreality is far more catching with the rest of the British P.O.W.s than he imagined). He sees natural foes, British and Japanese, joining together building a bridge of friendship in a time of war. And the final result is just destruction, confusion and death from that war. Is it any wonder that at the end, he mutters the two words in the ""Summary Line"" as the story's conclusion.",True
22,7,"A clash of wills, principles, and egos amidst the madness of war...",moonspinner55,n/a,15/08/2025,"British Army Colonel, captured along with his regimen by the Japanese on the island of Burma in 1943, refuses to abandon the rules of his government and build a railroad bridge across the Kwai river according to the plans of his mercurial Japanese counterpart, Colonel Saito. Saito, under orders from his superiors to have the bridge completed by a certain date, eventually yields to the Britisher's demands and construction gets under way, but a POW escapee from the American Navy has been recruited by British officials in nearby Ceylon to return to Burma and blow the bridge up. Complex clash of personalities, with Best Actor Oscar Winner Alec Guinness nimbly helping us to understand his character's motivations (he not only engineers the building of the bridge to aid the enemy, but helps construct a masterpiece--while underlings wonder if perhaps a temporary structure might have sufficed). To be engrossed by this Best Picture Academy Award winner is to eventually sympathize with Guinness' Colonel Nicholson, who figures it's better to build something worthwhile and long-lasting (even as a prisoner) than to do a sloppy job. David Lean (winner for Best Director) does some of his liveliest work behind the camera; opening the film carefully, like a good novel, he lays all these difficult, stubborn warriors on the table and allows us to get close to each one. That said, the big climactic finish--while suspenseful--is ultimately a let-down. Lean's staging is sufficient...perhaps the editing is at fault? Throwing out the people we've come to know so intimately for the sake of rousing visual action leaves a sour taste behind. Yes, it is the madness of war to finish with no winners, only losers; however, the way it plays out here feels half-hearted, and a line of dialogue from Jack Hawkins' Major Warden adds a curious layer of dissatisfaction and confusion. Pierre Boulle was also awarded an Oscar for adapting his own novel (he was fronting for blacklisted screenwriters Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson); Jack Hildyard won for his cinematography, Malcolm Arnold for his commanding music, and Peter Taylor for his (rather spotty) editing. *** from ****",False
23,10,An Intimate Epic,cwente2,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is neither an anti-war, nor a pro-war (if there is such a thing) film. I'm not really sure just what such designations actually mean. ""Bridge ..."" is richer and more personal than a simple depiction of epic events. In ""Bridge ..."", the epic supports the intimate. If you miss this, you miss a lot. ""Bridge ..."" is about the human heart first, and war second.After 47 years, it remains a powerful illustration of our failed hopes as human beings. (something sorely lacking in the more technically pre-occupied action films of today.) Oddly, it's an able companion to the less cinematic ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", or ""Cat On a Hot Tin Roof"" -- full of irony -- brilliant, subtle, and ultimately believable because we've all, in one way or another, experienced the feelings and the fears of the principals.You can't miss, entirely, this interpretation if you watch the film carefully, and open your senses to the quieter moments: Saito weeping alone having lost the battle of wills, or sending a letter home (Even a brutal camp warden can do that -- nation, race, codes of honor notwithstanding); Saito's confession to Nicholson that he had wanted to be an artist but that his father thought he ""belonged in the army""; the scene on the completed bridge, which Saito begins, looking at the sunset and quietly declaring - ""beautiful!"", with a detached Nicholson attributing the observation to the bridge (his obsession); Nicholson, in turn, speaking of his thoughtful realization that he is ""nearer the end than the beginning"", and wondering, aloud, what the sum total of his life has meant ""to anyone or anything"". . . Rescued by the bridge, Nicholson, at last, has something of value to leave behind.. . . Neither, are the supporting characters free of the ironies of our existence. Shears yearns for a world in which there's no place for war, but who's final act is the ultimate act of war -- killing the enemy close-up, with a knife, and ending his own life in the same cause as did the prisoner he buried, and who's name he could not recall. Joyce, the recruit, who's pre-war occupation consisted of checking and re-checking columns of figures, wants the challenge of ""thinking"". The denouement of his aspiration nearly costs Warden his life and, ultimately, costs him his own.The climactic irony (Shakespearian to be sure) comes with Nicholson's realization that he has been living in ""his own"" and not ""the world's"" reality. A ""friendly fire"" mortar round, exploded behind him, shakes him back to ""the way things are"". . . ""What have I done?"", he asks before he falls on the plunger that will explode his own -- his only -- ""beautiful creation"" (ironically, again, his enemy's confirmation).We all strive to create, or just contribute to, a world in which our dreams can flourish. This includes the powerful, who approve the wars, and the powerless, who fight them. But, often, we find the realities of that world make the dreams of our part in it impossible to realize: The ""madness"" which, above the carnage, Clipton desperately verbalizes.""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" is a true classic because it can be so many things to so many people -- and it is timeless: The kids and many adults will enjoy the action, the historians will enjoy critiquing its accuracy, veterans will re-visit the comradeship of the ""trenches"", and film buffs will revel in the picture's rhythm, drama, and well-executed technical elements.In the final analysis, the settings, costumes, historicity, etc. are only ""helpers"" (however beautifully provided by Lean and company). Its bigger theme -- the aspirations of the human heart, and the painful surrendering of those aspirations -- are what we are most urgently invited to experience in this extraordinary film. 10 out of 10.",True

The story itself, originally written by none other than noted French writer Pierre Boulle, who wrote the book, Planet of the Apes, was pleased with the finished project. The story is very loosely based on the actual construction endeavor, called building the Kwai bridge, is herein incorporated to include the British prisoner of war camp, run by the Japanese during World War Two. A culturally traditional, hard-nose commandant, one Col. Saito (internationally acclaimed Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa) has been given the task of constructing a railroad bridge over the river Kwai and is further ordered to have it completed by a given date. Failure is not an option. To his camp arrives an equally stubborn and somewhat arrogant British officer, one Col. Nicholson, (Alec Guinness) with several hundred POW soldiers. Already in the camp is a small detachment of American and allied soldiers who have been assailed and threatened to build the bridge. Among them is, Commander Shears (William Holden) an American POW who manages to escape the hell hole and makes it safely to a British base. Though Saito and Nicholson begin a battle of wits as to who is in command of the camp and its men, Shears is confronted by another British officer, Maj. Warden (Jack Hawkings) who asks him to return to the site of the bridge, to help him blow it up! James Donald plays Maj. Clipton, a British medical officer who watches as the various conflicting officers strive to give logic to insane goals.

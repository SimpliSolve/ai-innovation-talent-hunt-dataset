1,7,worthy of a watch,beingagain,n/a,15/08/2025,"Interesting, the documentary's subtle initial failure is to frame what it is that producers do v directors, obviously Jeremy Thomas has producing credits on very many many a good film, but some viewers maybe confused as to where to draw the line between what a director contributes and what a producer like jeremy adds to a film. I Guess largely that many a film would not get made without the producer, regardless of the talent of the director, producers being fixers and arrangers, often having the last word on casting and selecting the key players directors, script writers pulling the team together etc etc and it is a vital role, but the documentary doesn't elucidate such a technical overview as it is more revolves around Jeremys philosophic musings. As a documentary this will make you keen perhaps to view some of the films connected to Jeremy, This film touches a bit on how jeremys opportunitys were somewhat descended from his familys success in rather popular & gauche yet financially successful british cinema, which could be said to either pander to or be rather degenerative of british culture depending on your perspective, the end of the pier cruft that the carry on comedy series were, but descendant from that inherited wealth and connections, Jeremy Thomas was thereby enabled to help create some wonderful films and cinema, Tilda Swinton makes great repetitive emphasis of Jeremy being incredibly british culturally, though his jewish heritage is elucidated in the film, not that I perceive cultural appropriation as some grand crime, but this fits a little in that mould of some jewish people insisting in some way, of being more british than those solely of British heritage, which sticks a little. The film deals a little with the existential crises in creative life, the film in its duration can only afford skim over the grand arc of a lifes work, to pick over that cinematic history in an eclectic yet thoughtful way, the storm premise is a little forced, but it matters not, as one always needs something to pivot and anchor around, to start any endeavour and is forgiven, the chapters add some rough themes to what might be some abstract musings. The doc illustrates that whatever achievements, failures or controversies may be had in life, the creative mind moves on in hunting for new ground, and those that grow fat on experience are never really sated but age eventually slows talents, it may also engender in you the sense of the chiral feedback loop of opportunity and experience, that oft a few gorge on whilst others whither, most especially it seems those from the 60's were sort of exeriential mosters from a creative way and gorged in ways that seemingly wont happen again everything now to measured, death regardless of philosophical strength is a fear for all, but more so for those whose lives are ill lived with dissatisfaction as to ones endeavours, this doc highlights how really this age of cinema will not come again, but I guess ironically the death of independent cinema if it happens will no doubt be documented in a film. The doc touches very lightly on the over corporatisation of cinema by the giants that now bestride it, which inevitably leads to creativity being pushed out, but the irony is, that cinematic lifeblood must be reinvigorated by the creatives by somehow storming the bastions, to refresh the incestuous blood of corporate cinema.",False
2,2,Awful coda to a great career,davidusa-68904,n/a,15/08/2025,"This doc is frankly ridiculous. Mark Cousins had access to a fascinating trove of material and the man himself (who he refers to as 'the prince') riding with him yet he manages to create something unwatchable and frequently incomprehensible. I hope for the sake of his own legacy that Mr. Thomas disowns what could easily pass for a parody called 'The Pretentious Critic'. Here's a quote from outside the Lumiere factory; ""Workers streaming out like a river .... the source of the Nile"". I mean.... What????I bailed out, but my wife informs me it got worse, complete with footage of Mr. Cousins swimming naked. In a doc about Jeremy Thomas? Again.... What????",False

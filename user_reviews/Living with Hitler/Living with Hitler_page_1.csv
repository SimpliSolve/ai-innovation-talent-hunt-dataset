1,7,Decent,anon32948539453954,n/a,16/08/2025,"Decent structure and good pacing. Avoids repetitive narration and infusing bombastic music into every piece of chilling footage, and also there are no dramatizations - it is all archive footage.Unfortunately it fails to use historians/experts in a more meaningful way. It resorts to using their words in a very hasty way - sometimes just a few words instantly followed by another word snippet from another expert - might as well as just used the actual narration. This is a shame as the expert interviews themselves do not feel too scripted and many of them were apparently quite qualified historians.",False

1,4,Embarrassing,Thatbusistight,n/a,16/08/2025,"I felt embarrassed watching these self-proclaimed psychics fumble through these readings, stating vague information that or could not make sense (when they don't, they just brush it off) to the person being ""read"". These ""psychics"" continue to ask for more and more information from their subjects while they spew more nonsense that never really confirms that they are speaking to the other side.These folks seem like actors, skilled (in some cases) at keeping a conversation going even if they're just talking in circles. I'm all about there being a connection to the other side, but this does nothing to prove or convince me of anything. These readings look like a theater student forgetting their lines or having an awkward experience at an improv class. Oof, this missed the mark for me.",False
2,5,Needs To Be Recut,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Psychic ability is a subject that often mystifies yet captivates many of us. It's also a topic that's frequently misunderstood and comes with a lot of distorted, uninformed baggage in need of serious clarification. Those looking to be enlightened about it, however, are unlikely to come away from director Lana Wilson's documentary on the subject with much new or profound insight. The film profiles seven New York City psychic professionals through conversations with these individuals and footage from sessions with some of their clients. Regrettably, though, this overlong offering is in serious need of being trimmed and recut. Much of the material becomes redundant and tedious as the film progresses, and the picture frequently focuses on the wrong content. Many of the client sessions, for example, are abruptly cut short just as they're starting to get interesting. In addition, the interviews with the psychics are at their best when they wax philosophically about the nature of this phenomenon (particularly when discussing how they became involved in this practice, often through artistic, healing and self-acceptance avenues), but there's not nearly enough of these fascinating metaphysical musings. And then there's a potentially intriguing collective gathering involving all seven psychics that, sadly, receives woefully short shrift, again getting clipped just as it's becoming engaging. Instead of more of what works best in the film, viewers are left with numerous easily eliminated pregnant pauses, often-superfluous descriptions about everyday aspects of the psychics' personal lives and overly repetitive discussion of subjects addressed in the session material (especially those involving the work of a pet psychic, an intriguing but vastly overused narrative element). ""Look Into My Eyes"" could have been a genuinely revelatory, insightful examination of this subject, but the filmmaker has not made the most of that golden opportunity. Instead of providing audiences with a meaningful, articulate look into the subject matter, viewers are left with a meandering, unfocused treatment of a topic that could be valuable and impactful to many of us - and that truly deserves better handling than what's presented here.",False
3,5,"If You Can't Find the Answers Within Yourself, Seek Psychotherapy, Not a Psychic",jeannettelouisesmith,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like most people in life, both the ""psychics"" and clients in this film need emotional attention, want to feel special, and find meaning in life. The answers to our biggest questions in life are unanswerable. The heavy-duty theatrical theme and overly dramatic moments that run through this documentary reveals a complete lack of credibility. Anyone can use their intuition, empathy, and compassion to help people seeking solace. People with confidence who are in tune with themself and their environment can logically work out issues and found solutions. If you want to have a psychic reading for fun, go ahead. If you need a help to work out a situation, talk to someone you know and trust. If you're grappling with real trauma, please seek help from someone with a Master's Degree in Counseling.",False
4,3,Depressing and misguiding,bethechangeyouwanttosee-86582,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not sure what the intention was for this documentary. Exposing fake or terrible psychics? It does a disservice to the subject matter. There are some talented mediums who don't prey on people. I can't tell if these psychics are just terrible or fraudulent. Either way, each one of them show many signs of depression. That is exploitive. Is it expose' or exploitation? Problematic either way. If expose' was intended, perhaps we should have been able to hear from psychics with a solid reputation to fairly try to defend the subject matter. I've had some good experiences with psychics where the information could be validated by me without leading the psychic.",False
5,7,Touching and eye opening doc of connections that brings emotions.,blanbrn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I for one always like watching interesting docs and this ""Look Into My Eyes"" was one that was no different as it follows thru interviews and chat sessions with several different ""New York City"" residents all who have had life experiences that involve lost loved ones who have left to soon. And many recount how these loses have affected their personal lives and thru talking with and becoming clients of psychics this has helped them function more and better. Also from acting, singing, and expressing feelings thru art drawings this too helps with each loss and dealing with life in the spirit world of tarot cards, and the supernatural that could exist in the form of the gone loved ones that they miss. The film is touching, heart warming, and brings out emotions proving that connections thru talk, expression, and belief in the spirit world brings help and hope.",False
6,2,Cold Readers,katharineshowalter,n/a,16/08/2025,"The trailer promises a new look at the world of psychic readings, but what we get are sometimes too-intimate looks at the lives of a series of scammers who sell the illusion of talking to the dead or to pets or to dead pets in order to comfort people who are emotionally fragile and clearly not the sharpest knives in the rack.That suckers go to psychics for succor is no great revelation, although this documentary seems to think it is, and then it goes to pains to say that's okay. In that very modern falsehood of thinking validating everyone's feeling is a good idea. Maybe just tell the person, ""Hey, your dog's probably dead, but who knows?"" and let them live in reality. Don't too many of us hang on to deception? Isn't that part of the reason we're descending into a totalitarian regime in 2025?While no names or narration are given to guide us, the documentary all but exposes each of the ""psychics"" as hucksters, many of whom seem mentally ill and who narcissistically see only their own pains in everyone elses's. Other just seem like empathetic people who spout feel-good nonsense as band-aids, and you have to wonder what their clients really think afterward. But we never hear from them.It's very telling that many of the fleecers portrayed here talk openly about their dreams of art and acting. It seems that while they never made it to Broadway, they all found their stages, given the lovely size of many of their apartments.It's also telling that they all come from disempowered, disenfranchised communities (women, gay, African American), a sad reminder of how effective is the brainwashing done by the elite and/or religion (in this case, the delusion of an afterlife and of magic).",False
7,7,SPIRITED CONVERSATIONS,stusviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"A group of professional psychics advise their clients on-camera, while at other times the psychics bare their own souls to an interviewer seated off-camera. True believers may love this stuff, cynics may scoff at it, and the open-minded may at least be willing to give it a chance--an attitude that will no doubt be helped by the sheer drama and compelling nature of the stories themselves. One psychic reveals that she went into the business following the sudden death of her mother; another joined the ranks of ""animal psychics"" when, out of sorts and at a crossroads in her life, she read something about that aspect of the business and decided to give it a try. (The notion of communicating with pets--especially dead ones--might be the most hard-to-swallow part of the whole movie.) Many of the pros have been struggling to make a go of it in the arts--as actors, writers, or otherwise--they all seem to live in modest New York City apartments, and everybody, medium and client alike, has suffered abuse or experienced the death of a loved one or is burdened by dreams deferred. They're all alone and lonely, partner-free and quietly desperate. ""Look Into My Eyes"" is not for everyone, but if you think you might enjoy a talking heads documentary about a fringe profession that features seances and the like--not to mention the troubled folks who are grateful that the profession exists--it's most definitely the movie to see. Surprisingly absorbing and thoroughly watchable, even if you're a (moderate) cynic like me.",False
8,1,This is false advertising,Doctumentary_hater84034,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this documentary on Max, and the poster looked like a horror movie. The genre did not include 'documentary' and only stated 'paranormal' and 'supernatural'. I sat through 42 minutes of this waiting for something to happen, and I only realized that it was a documentary after I looked it up on Google. I could have spent my time watching actual good movies. Instead, I wasted it on this. Please do not watch this documentary, unless you are not like me and don't hate documentaries. I don't ever want to view something as disgusting as this ever again, I watched nearly half of it and it was just people talking.",False
9,8,What We Do In The Shadows of Pain,dtswpod,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the film *Look Into My Eyes*, a doctor consults a psychic to help her process the death of a little girl who died in her ER. Is this seemingly intelligent woman deluded? Are any of the clients who seek out those who profess to have otherworldly powers out of their minds for doing so? And what about these so-called magic people? Do they truly believe in their ability to speak with the dead and see into the future? The film doesn't ask.Instead, this documentary on psychics who work around Manhattan doesn't judge its subjects. Rather, the viewer is simply presented with people (most of whom are frustrated, if not failed, actors) who are as confused and hurting as anyone who feels the need for supernatural guidance.Personally, I appreciated the lack of judgment throughout the picture. By not putting anyone on the defensive, we are allowed to glimpse this world with the mask off. None of the clairvoyants seem confident in their alleged powers. They all express doubt. One man is devastated when his attempt to read someone fails spectacularly, appearing genuinely hurt when his talent falters.In fact, the sadness throughout the film is hard to miss. As the movie reaches its conclusion, one thing becomes clear: we all carry a lot of trauma, and some of us are willing to try anything to resolve it. Humans don't want to believe that bad things happen just because they happen. We are desperate to make the incomprehensible make sense. And people don't care if you have to fabricate answers to give them that solace. After all, which would you prefer: a world where a little girl is shot dead and that's the end, or one where her death is the beginning of a brand new adventure?Of course, death is death. No, you don't go on to other things when you take your last breath. But while that may be the truth, the truth doesn't always set you free.",False
10,10,Powerful storytelling,joshua1230,n/a,16/08/2025,"The storytelling by Lana was superb as was the cinematography and lighting. This became not a story about if psychic readings are true, but how people can heal through this sort of interaction. We get to know the people going to the readers and then the readers themselves, how they found their individual gifts and how they came to offering readings. The pacing was good and Lana delicately weaves the 7 psychics with multiple clients that culminate into an emotional climax that is both heartfelt and rewarding. It was funny and deeply moving with a few pull at the heartstring moments. Def watch!!",False
11,10,very beautiful movie,Betelgeuse67,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a beautiful documentary. I loved hearing people's stories. It flowed beautifully, too. Im not a skeptic at all but i use my discernment. I would only pay to see two of the psychics. I cringed at some readings in the movie. I also cried for the girl and her animal. I enjoyed every moment of this documentary. It would have been nice if all the psychics were legit. It seemed like some of them were legit and some probably just wanted to be in a movie to advance their ""acting"" career. Im definitely glad I watched this, but at times it was hard to see people being scammed in front of me for example when they would ask the clients questions.",False
12,10,Yikes,killercola,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's a few poor reviews but please ignore them. Obviously this documentary went way above there intellectual capacities.""Look Into My Eyes,"" is an A24 documentary about a portrait of mediums and their clients. It's best described as a nonfiction movie where the whole point is to watch people, listen to what they say, and think about the emotions they feel as they tell their stories. Clearly that escaped some of the low reviews posted here.The film identifies no one onscreen with printed names and titles. There are no headlines, montages or other forms of narrative help. By watching them interact, you figure out who's the medium and who's the client. It's the kind of movie that communicates what matters to it by how it gathers and presents information. That feels like the right approach considering the subject matter, which is a profession that many people are skeptical about.Highly recommended viewing. One of the best docs I've seen in awhile.",False
13,10,A very human experience,snowvixen13,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed this documentary. It shows that connection between humans is important and reminds us that we are having a human experience on this planet. It also shows that we as Mediums are very normal people who are also imperfect and don't always have the answers, even for ourselves. Mediums often go to other Mediums for guidance because there can be a lack of communication from our own loved ones on the other side. Spirit is always right when it comes to timing of knowledge. Things that may not make sense at the moment, will click a little later down the road. I did find it interesting that most of the people portrayed were also involved in the performing arts. Psychics and Mediums tend to have creative and artistic abilities. Not all of course, but many. Great down to earth and real documentary. Bravo.",False

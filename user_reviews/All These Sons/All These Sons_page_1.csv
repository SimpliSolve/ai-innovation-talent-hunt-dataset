1,8,ground level documentary,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's the summer of 2018. Gun violence has overwhelmed the black communities on the south and west side of Chicago. Two men struggle to reclaim some young men at high risk. They struggle in a system which had closed schools and left the young men with little education. It is a world of everyday violence and might makes right. This is a ground level documentary in two ways.The film is recording the ground level existence of these men and they start their journeys from that ground level. It seems like an impossible task. There is redemption to be had, but it is a perilous journey. I don't know if it's doable. The movie does end with some hope and that may be enough for now.",False

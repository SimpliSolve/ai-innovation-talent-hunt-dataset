1,10,Simply Remarkable,DavoZed,n/a,15/08/2025,"A simply remarkable documentary, showing the conditions on the ground in Wuhan, during their epidemic and lockdown. The situation in their medical facilities and in the city itself.The medical staff were unfailingly kind and extremely patient throughout. The patients and their relatives were largely that way as well.Full credit to the medical staff and to the filmmakers, who gave us this remarkable view inside the epidemic at ground zero.Another big reason for watching the doc is to see the Chinese people react to and cope with the pandemic. The West often sees the Chinese as communist or socialist zombies, doing exactly what they are told.As the doc shows, they are funny and kind and very concerned about helping each other to overcome the virus. They are DRAMATICALLY more human and dramatically more focused on the greater good, than a group of people would be in the US.That helped them to quickly overcome the virus and keep deaths in China to an absolute minimum? Of course.",False

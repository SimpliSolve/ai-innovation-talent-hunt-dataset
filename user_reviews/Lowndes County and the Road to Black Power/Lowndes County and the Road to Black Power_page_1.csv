2,10,This is why they don't want this history taught.,sydnee_man,n/a,17/08/2025,This is actual news coverage of what went on with voting rights for black people in the south. If this part of American history is taught it might make people think. People might start connecting the dots on how and why black people haven't done as well as others. I applaud shows like this and I'm thankful for the people who make sure these types of programs get made. The fact that certain politicians don't want this being taught is schools speaks volumes. It's interesting that these politicians don't deny that this information is true. They just don't want people to know about it. All Americans should be wondering - what are they trying to hide and why are they trying to hide it.,False

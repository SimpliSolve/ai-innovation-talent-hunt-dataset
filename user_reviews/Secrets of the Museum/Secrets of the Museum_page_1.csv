1,9,Amazing Series,vishuddhathakkar,n/a,15/08/2025,As a V&A fan it was amazing to see what goes on behind the scenes of some of the great exhibitions being shown at the museum. The series is wonderfully made exploring a mix of different artefacts and displays along with the interviews of the contributors. Learnt a lot about the art of restoration and the amount of care and effort invested by the curators so we the public can enjoy the treasures the museum owns. Would love to watch another series.,False
2,9,Low-key and fascinating.,kantell,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love this series. It's a low-key show that is just delightful. Nice to have something that has zero stress other than watching the, carefully move a priceless piece of history,They pick objects, check the, for damage to see if they can be displayed or shipped, fix damage and clean, if needed, sometimes go to see the creator of the object or a relative if they have passed, and then show the object in the museum with said creator or family or person of interest invited.The museum workers are extremely educated and very knowledgeable on their area of expertise be it textile, art, pop culture and even toys! They are all very friendly and you can tell they adore their jobs.It's like watching a history nerd convention of extremely friendly fans who are addicted to priceless objects, but have the utmost respect for the, and delight in watching others enjoy them as well.If you like museums and documentaries and/or have ever wondered how a museum works before an object goes on display, I highly recommend it.",False

1,9,As a 49ers end didn't like the ending...,huizingaevan,n/a,16/08/2025,Really got a good appreciation for all of the players who were involved with this especially Amon Ra. I always thought him remembering all of the recievers drafted before him was kind of corny but knowing more about his mindset made me gain a lot more respect for him. And as a 49ers fan loved seeing even more Deebo & Kittle even though the ending brought back trauma. I also liked seeing Jefferson stripped back as a really chill dude and how a lot of the players battled injuries. Seeing insight into how Davante Adams & the raiders turned around their season (morally at least) was also really great to see. Overall was great getting a closer look into some of the leagues best.,False
2,9,A Nice Follow-Up To Quarterback,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the summer of 2023, I thoroughly enjoyed the behind-the-scenes look that Netflix's Quarterback gave to the NFL. In 2024, much of that same spirit was captured in this Receiver installment.This time around, Peyton Manning's documentary crew follows wide receivers Justin Jefferson (MIN), Amon-Ra St. Brown (DET), Davante Adams (LVR), Deebo Samuel (SF), and George Kittle (SF) through the 2023 season, chronicling their on-field exploits as well as their home life.Each wideout has an interesting story:-Jefferson's ascension to the WR stratosphere and recovering from his first major injury-St. Brown leading the Lions deeper into the playoffs than decades past-Adams' struggle going from the perpetually-winning Packers to a more meager Vegas variety.-Kittle and Samuel persevering through all the bumps and bruises it takes to make a Super Bowl run.The first thing that will jump out at viewers here is that Kittle is the absolute star of the show. His personality is absolutely magnetic and one can't take eyes off him every time he's on screen. While Jefferson, Adams, and Brown are a bit more taciturn or reserved, Kittle (and to a lesser extent Deebo) make this whole sequel series work.Is it as good as Quarterback? Well, I gave that initial effort 10/10 stars, so I'd have to say probably not quite. But the 9/10 rating here puts it close enough to still be extremely entertaining. The need to cover so many figures perhaps holds it back from realizing its true potential a little bit.A small gripe, however, for what just may be turning into an annual ""football is in the air"" sort of summer series.",False
3,10,Netflix taking over the sports documentary landscape,jordankrause,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, I really appreciate the guys who took the time to be a part of this series, and the film crews that followed. Top tier storylines, filming, and editing.I recently tore my Achilles and the frames of Kirk Cousins showed how humbly he took the injury and the different sides of the game that no one sees off of the TV screen. All of the athletes endured adversity and have fought to come back better and stronger. Cannot have been easy for Jettas or Deebo and I appreciate them bearing all for some great content for the fans.Episode 7 has to be one of the best episodes of TV ever. No rooting stake in any of these teams but it had me tearing up over and over. These guys sacrifice so much for the game of football so that we can enjoy the product every Sunday.Well done Netflix!",False
4,10,I love the Kittles so much!,babycwgrl13,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thoroughly enjoyed this documentary series. I'm a 49ers fan which explains part of the reason why I loved this series but also, my grandfather was a professional football coach and I grew up with football. Especially NFL football. Obviously, it was awesome seeing DeeBo and George here and leaving more about them. I absolutely love Claire Kittle. I love how loud and unapologetic she is as well as her husband. But I also loved learning more about JJ, Davonte, and Amon Ra St. Brown. Admittedly, I enjoyed Davonte the least out of the five ""receivers."" But that's because he comes off as a diva. Not that the other 4 don't have ""diva moments"" but Davonte spent a lot of time complaining and that got kind annoying quickly. The ending, though I knew it was coming, sucked cause I'm a Niners fan but all in all, I really enjoyed this series.",False
5,10,Not to bad,PhoenixGod00,n/a,16/08/2025,"High stakes. High speed. High emotion.Netflix's Receiver is a masterclass in storytelling. A follow-up to Quarterback, but this time the lens shifts from the passers to the playmakers - the wide receivers and tight ends who put their bodies on the line every single week to move the chains, flip momentum, and light up the scoreboard.But this isn't just a football docuseries. It's a deep dive into pressure, identity, family, loyalty, and legacy - all told through the eyes of five of the NFL's most dynamic players.George Kittle - A Force of NatureKittle is the soul of this series. He brings energy, chaos, and charisma to every frame, but he also brings heart. You see the physical toll, the focus in training, and the fire he brings on game day. But what really elevates his segments? The presence of his wife, Claire.She's more than just his partner - she's part of his team. Confident, grounded, and impossible to miss, Claire Kittle brings a genuine warmth and presence to the show. And let's be honest: absolute smoke show. But it's not just looks - it's the way she supports George while holding her own. She's got real star power, and you see why they work so well together.Deebo Samuel - Built DifferentDeebo isn't just a receiver - he's a hybrid, a weapon, a game-changer. His story highlights what it means to carry the physical and mental weight of a team's expectations. He plays through pain, deals with adversity head-on, and keeps his circle tight. What you get from Deebo is honesty. There's no fa√ßade, just a competitor who knows his worth and works every day to prove it.Davante Adams - The TechnicianThis is where the art of football gets real. Watching Davante break down routes, technique, and mindset is like sitting in a masterclass. His scenes are filled with reflection - on success, on struggle, and on the quiet cost of being one of the best in the game. You see the leadership, the hunger, and the emotional depth behind the highlight reels. He's not just chasing greatness - he's carrying it.Amon-Ra St. Brown - Hungry and FocusedAmon-Ra doesn't forget. Every name, every draft pick ahead of him - it fuels him. What makes his story hit hard is the way he turns that chip on his shoulder into something surgical. He's calculated, intense, and laser-focused. His family life, especially the relationship with his father and brother, gives the viewer a real glimpse into how champions are raised. Every detail of his routine, every ounce of discipline - it's all intentional.Justin Jefferson - Cool Under PressureJJ carries himself like he's been doing this for 20 years. Calm, composed, and quietly confident. His presence is powerful, even when he's not saying much. But when adversity hits - especially with injuries - you see another side of him. A man who's had to learn how to sit still when all he knows is motion. His story is quieter than the others, but it lands just as hard. He's a leader, whether the lights are on or not.Why It's LegendaryThis series takes everything Quarterback did right and levels it up. The production is cinematic without feeling staged. The stories are vulnerable without being forced. You see the grind - the real, raw, exhausting grind - but you also see why these men love the game.You get behind closed doors. You see who's at their side when the lights go off. And in George Kittle's case, you see a wife who stands out in her own right. Claire gets a lot of screen time, and she owns every second of it. Stylish, smart, and striking - she makes it clear that she and George are a unit. That matters.Final WordReceiver is a reminder that greatness comes with a cost - and it's never paid alone. These aren't just highlight-reel athletes. These are sons, husbands, fathers, teammates, and survivors of a system that demands everything.Ten out of ten. For the grit. For the vulnerability. For the glory. And for giving the playmakers their long-overdue spotlight.",False
6,1,Real Housewives of the NFL,paindude-23367,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nothing technical, took the all the Twitter nonsense that was minimally included in Quarterback and expanded it to fill all the time. This is trash for bored housewives who know nothing about football. Parties, what they spend money on, etc. Manning should have quit while ahead, and Netflix blew it big time.As an example, in Quarterback much of the time was spent explaining how they need to study and plan for their games. A fair amount was also spent on the training and on how each QB planned to have a long career through careful attention to training and how they played.This trash is just on their parties, their money, and their crews. Perfect for pre-teen slumber parties.",False

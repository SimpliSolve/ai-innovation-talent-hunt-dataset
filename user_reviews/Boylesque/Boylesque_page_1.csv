1,1,A Culture of Victimhood,arfdawg-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"An openly gay man organized underground parties and after curfew salons of men inside private apartments. He enthusiastically took up drag, despite a fiercely homophobic culture, to free himself from the stifling correctness of the 80s.Yet another thoroughly boring, useless, inaccurate, lie-filed psuedo-documentary, in part from HBO.First of all the film is poorly made. They just don't put money behind these projects because they want to flood the market with as many as possible so they do them cheaply.Next, they just make up stuff. While maybe the 70's an before there was a culture of predudice, byt the 80's it was gone. Be honest. You are not a martyr in the 80's and later youre a whiner. Your so-called parties didnt need to be underground. Period.",False

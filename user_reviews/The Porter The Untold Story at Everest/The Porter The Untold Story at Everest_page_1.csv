1,6,"Youtube level, low production standard document of one man's experience.",Rob-O-Cop,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not trying to diminish what Nathaniel did, but ""white dude carries way too many bags up a hill for other white people who would rather pay someone to do it rather than tire themselves out"" isn't really that interesting a story, even though almost 30 reviews would have you believe it is. The production values aren't much, in that a lot of it is shot inside a dimly lite hut, the sound is pretty rough with much of the outdoor sound being covered in wind noise, a wind sock apparently wasn't packed, so I'm guessing it was all camera or phone microphone.It is an interesting insight into the local world of porters though so it definitely gets merit points for that.",False
2,8,Raw and inviting,keskyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is how I love my documentaries, raw with no post-edit music and voiceover asserting a condescending 'insert appropriate emotion here'.I can feel the cold, the stillness, and the altitude through the wind. Like the crackle of putting needle to vinyl, those who want fidelity in their productions are probably too young to remember the nostalgia of sounds in this cleaned-up world.There's an attachment here to the everyday lives of these remote community people, mainly due to the static point-of-view shots at close quarters which allow the eyes wonder around the mementos, and I felt like a polite guest invited into their world.The world needs more documentary amateurs who are not funded by huge budgets, so stories are told as reality because some of the best stories are made with empty pockets.",False
3,6,A Glimpse Into Everest's Unsung Heroes,dierregi,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Walk a mile in their shoes... if you can.""The Porter is a refreshing yet sobering dive into the lives of Nepalese Sherpas, the men and women who, six months out of the year, lug the oversized baggage of affluent Westerners determined to conquer Everest. It's a journey through the stark reality of Sherpa life, exposing the invisible backbone of luxury mountain climbing - a pursuit where a ticket up the world's tallest peak can easily run beyond 60,000 Euro. So, not your average getaway. For that price, you get a chance to revel in frostbite, brush up against mortality, and maybe even return with an impressive new set of mountain ailments.Enter Nathaniel J. Menninger, a Westerner who set out to document what it's really like to endure the Sherpas' daily grind. Attempting to carry loads up to 100kg over 11 days, he made it to the end (after nearly collapsing on day four). His adventure highlights both the grueling conditions and the shockingly low wages Sherpas earn - a pittance, supplemented only by optional tourist tips, which, unsurprisingly, are not always forthcoming.On the technical front, The Porter is stripped to its bones - perhaps a bit too bare. The documentary's minimalism might leave you feeling as if it ended mid-sentence. While Menninger earns kudos for living through a slice of Sherpa life, his editorial finesse could use some polish. Still, it's a worthy watch for anyone curious about the people who shoulder Everest's weight, figuratively and quite literally.",False
4,10,Beautiful and unpretentious.,zeejaybcue,n/a,16/08/2025,"So often these nature trek docs take on a self-righteous tone, and The Porter rises above the pack in both its portrayal of porters and in the humble yet adventurous attitude of its other subject, Nate. While it rightly touches on the hardships of porter life, the highlight of this film is the joy, hospitality, and sense of humor of the porters and locals as Nate ascends Everest. Beautifully shot and endlessly inspiring.",False
5,9,I watched this as if it were an award winning documentary,CasualConnection,n/a,16/08/2025,"And it should be. Wow, this was amazing in so many ways. Thanks a lot for making this, and sharing it with us for free. I will make a full review some day. 10 out of 10 for me, worth every second, I didn't want it to end... P.S. the trailer and headers do not do this documentary any justice.",False
6,10,"Incredible, inspiring and funny",qvjupqmyn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a brilliant, informing, funny and awe inspiring film. To follow the journey in the documenting wasn't just entertaining but it was so well done it made you feel you had the pleasure of doing so.I've watched it a few times now and each time you pick up some new or a little one liner that you missed before.It's such a fantastic watch, it deserves nothing but success.",False
7,10,Uncover the Truth of Mt. Everest!,wanderlustdani,n/a,16/08/2025,"What truly captivated me about this documentary was how raw it was. Not only was the quality of the footage incredible, but the storyline had me feeling as if I was right there with them.I found myself deeply invested in Nate's story and everyone that was introduced along the way. I also felt an emotional connection to the hardships and joy they felt throughout the journey.For anyone who is passionate about adventure, looking to learn something new, or wants to become transported into the Himalayas I highly recommend The Porter: The Untold Story at Everest. You won't be disappointed!",False
8,n/a,The life of Mount Everest porters documentary,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Nate takes on the audacious goal of emersion into the porter life. The film does an impressive job of documenting the daily life of the nepali people who carry loads up the trail to Mount Everest.,False
9,3,Pretty but empty,agfw-282-778003,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really wanted to love this documentary going in to it and whilst the scenery was lovely and the general idea that a porters life is a hard one, nothing new was really discovered.I understand the idea was for the young white western man to challenge himself, I found the experience a bit empty.More frank, open discussions with the native porters and their families would have been eye opening I'm sure, along the lines of the old timer he spoke to and how they where treated 10 or so years back by the local populace.I'm hoping he donated his earnings to the other porters and didn't remove the opportunity for a local porter to earn some money for the season.I can see potential and I hope this inspires more from this team, just with a bit more content and interest in local culture and work life.",False
10,10,An incredible journey that shows us a side of Everest we never usually see.,Brandir802,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found this film by accident and started to watch it without really thinking. But I was quickly drawn into the film. It is very subtle and understated, letting the sherpas and the scenery tell the story as Nate went through the same experiences as a group of sherpas taking equipment/suppliers to Everest basecamp for 'western' tourists.It was an incredible journey that shows us a side of Everest we never usually see.",False
11,n/a,Meeting Nate,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"During my trek to Gokyo in 2019 I met Nate 2 times
It was in the beginning of his experience as a porter
Immediately he got me with enthusiasm
The way he talked about the subject and his approach of the delicate subject showed me his compassion and integrity
I saw this documentary a year later and was surprised about how he managed to get the right tone and sphere of the living in the Himalayan",False
12,10,Free spirit proving you can live as out of the box as you dare,haydnflores,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having travelled across Spain, Belize, and Guatemala with Nate, I know him as the go-with-the-flow American who never has any qualms with anyone.A completely open mind and free spirit, Nate is a master of seizing opportunities that test the limits of the human body and mind.The Porter displays a phenomenal perspective from the Himalayas that few have seen before. Watching this documentary has me thinking of out of the box dreams within my grasp.",False
13,10,Incredible,connorcyoung-97062,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a powerful film that opened my eyes to an incredible injustice. Everyone should watch this film and spread Nate's message, hopefully leading to positive change.",False
14,9,Incredible story and production,michaelcrhoads,n/a,16/08/2025,"The incredible footage and amazing voyage that Nate takes really helps bring the situation down to a somewhat relatable level. An average American putting himself in the shoes, actual shoes, of an impoverished/struggling class of people. It shows how incredibly difficult and dangerous the profession they're in to provide for their families. Foreigners come into their country and user their services, which I have no issue with, but the film exposes how they're seen as disposable and treated entirely unfairly. It causes you to think about how your actions do affect the people that you encounter even while traveling for a short period of time.There really isn't a personally produced film like it and it sets a new bar for the genre.",False
15,10,Bringing light to these issues can bring change,kathkristu,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you for bringing light into this issue. This documentry clearly shows us about the unorganized accomodation and low salary rate for porters. I was really concerned about their health and safety, carrying that big load.With the clients as well, not everyone is in a situation of tipping hundred dollars for sure. In most circumstances, people have this mindset in Nepal that, white faces are rich and have a lot of money, which is obviously not always true.Hopefully, this will help to improve the current situation.

16,10,An inspiring story,victoriahelena-48800,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary just caught me from the start, the way it shows the magnificent Nepalese people, the incredible and honest challenge Ned had undertaken, the harsh reality of the everyday life of a porter, but at the same time the positive way in which they do their work and hope for a better life for their families and the amazingly beautiful landscapes is really breathtaking. The message is clear, is inspiring, it makes you want to support ethic tourism and makes you want to visit these wonderful place, not as a regulsr tourist but to be embedded by the culture and meet these wonderful people. I was impressed!!!",True
17,10,A Harrowing Reality Check,jnannen,n/a,16/08/2025,"A visceral and necessary testament to the power of the human spirit. The filmmaker's lust for life and quest for understanding are contagious. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who may need to zoom out on their life and take careful stock of the luxuries afforded to Westerners and how we might pay that privilege forward to rally behind a worthy cause and champion the rights of those who are deeply and wrongfully mired in an oppressive cycle of back-breaking labor and crippling poverty. If you require a worthy cause to rally behind, watch this film immediately.",False
18,10,Never seen another film quite like it,leobraudy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nate takes the viewer into a side of climbing Everest arguably no other Westerners have ever seen, let alone filmed. An eye opening film and a must watch.",False
19,9,Bravo,jr_bordley,n/a,16/08/2025,A fascinating film. An eyeopener. I knew nothing about the porter culture before viewing this film. I had my seventh grade World Geography students watch this film to complement our studies of South Asia. I had my advisees watch this film for inspiration during the early months of corona lockdown in spring 2020. It is definitely worth watching. Thank you for sharing your story and bringing attention to the struggles of porters.,False
20,10,wonderfully done and deeply insightful,mjroberson,n/a,16/08/2025,"A raw and unique look into the life of a sherpa. This film does a phenomenal job demonstrating some of the vastness of this life by allowing those who should be telling their story to tell it. Important lessons in privilege, empathy, and resilience wrapped up in a documentary that will hopefully be a catalyst for positive change throughout the region and industry. Enjoy and reflect",False
21,10,Great movie,shrutisherchan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a great movie/documentary. I wish the movie was longer, it's sooo good. Respect for the porters and especially Nathaniel for putting it all together.",False
22,10,The life of a Mount Everest Porter lived and documented by an American,johnironbear,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Porter is one of the best documentaries I've seen thus far in my life. That Nathaniel had the tenacity and courage to do it and document it is in itself nothing short of phenomenal in my estimation, but even more so is the life these people live. Theirs is one of unbelievable hardship and difficulty, yet they accept it as their lot and they carry on, and they laugh and find joy in the small things like the rest of us do... and they do it for next to no profit at times save the generosity of the people they are working for.Nathaniel brought that to light in a such way that no one could have unless they had lived it, and in that light I give this a solid ten stars for the filmmaking, and for Nate's incredible Will to finish what he set out to do, and for the crew's exemplary work as well.",False
23,10,Charming documentary,awongolding,n/a,16/08/2025,So glad that we chanced upon The Porter on YouTube. It's a sensitive look at the lives of Everest's porters through the eyes of a young American man. It's heartwarming and real without being patronising. Thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend to all.,False
24,10,"Must see if you love trekking, mountaineering and himalayas.",ujjalmaharjan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Best documentary featuring, behind the scenes of the hardship of the guys who really are one of the backbone of mountaineering and trekking.
just one question in my mind, is the wage fair enough.",False
25,10,INSANE!!!,nacho-93188,n/a,16/08/2025,The best documentary I've seen in the past couple of years,False

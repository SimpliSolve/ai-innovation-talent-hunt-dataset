1,10,Wonderful film,madhumatimadhu,n/a,15/08/2025,"A much-required film. It is educating as well as enlightening. May no woman have to go through what these women have gone through. Very hard-hitting. It was rather difficult for me to absorb what these women have experienced, since i am a super-empath, and could feel every word that they spoke. I am grateful to all the beautiful people who made this film possible. I wish the world leaders would somehow turn compassionate and humane, and stop whatever this unnatural madness that seems to be taking over the world. The western world is already destroyed, and now even in Bharat the politicians are encouraging this disease. Very horrific indeed.",False
2,10,Disturbing but necessary and beautifully made,annettepacey,n/a,15/08/2025,"This beautifully made film gives voice to a group perpetually sidelined by the dominant narrative in media and society which celebrates men who come out as trans as brave and treats them as victims of prejudice and bigotry. The wives (and children) of these heterosexual, autogynophilic men are often expected to cheer on the destruction of own their lives, hopes and plans in favour of the sexual needs of these men. The film is made up of many stories from women all around the world who have found themselves in this position, and the many commonalities are striking, despite the different circumstances in each case. The way that these women's experiences of legal, financial, psychological and emotional abuse are dismissed and they are pressured to play the role of supportive partner at the expense of their own basic needs shows that everyone knows, really, who is a woman and who isn't. Even for those of us we'll steeped in gender critical spaces, this film contains some shocking details. Ultimately there is a message of hope from women who have come through this and seek to help others in a similar position. Everyone, but especially those persuaded by the ""stunning and brave"" narrative promoted by trans activists and media, should watch this.",False
3,10,Giving voices to those not heard before,googlyeyedllama,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a great documentary! Focus on the women and their experiences. Women who often don't get listened to and have their experiences dismissed.An emotional, but incredibly important watch. No sensationalism or graphic images. Just well delivered truths and experiences from women around the world who suffered with agp men in their lives.The animation to protect women's identities, the research and interviews with prominent women from journalists to founders of organisations. It all comes together giving a calm and measured approach, while remaining focused on the women and children who are often stuck in these situations.",False
4,10,Must watch,jawoxxx,n/a,15/08/2025,"A film about transwidows. Women who married men who disclose they are trans after being married. These are women who talk about the abuse and coercion their pain and the pain for the children involved. The film is brilliantly made. The graphics and the music are superb. The women are brave and talk honestly about their ordeals. Men who claim to be women are celebrated worldwide, the women and children who suffer at the hand of these narcs now finally have a voice. It's about time to address this issue. It's rather overdue. Thank you to the brave women who shared their experiences with us, the supporting artist and thank you so much Vaishnavi Sundar.",False
5,10,Timely film about the harmful narratives,kittycatcharms,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a great documentary film that shines a light on what happens behind closed doors. Not everything is as it seems. Women and children's experiences are still dismissed by many in society.This film provides a good combination of expert testimonies and testimonies from women and children who have been impacted by cross-sex ideating men. It is both emotional and educational. It highlights important aspects of the common narrative, that is often swept under the rug.The film is a good length and is split ""mini chapters"" of sort covering various important points without dragging on for too long.I recommend everyone watch this film.",False
6,9,"Totally haunting and dramatic, really well done!",sandervandedonk,n/a,15/08/2025,"The stories of trans widows, ie, women who are married to a man who starts to identify as a woman, often for sexual gratification, as a fetish.. These stories are often unheard.This documentary gives these women a voice,The documentary adresses all the common themes and problems that arise from being in a relationship with someone who starts erotic crossdressing / identifying as trans, problems such as suicide baiting, getting divorced, (child) abuse etc....Especially of interest are the animations/graphics that were hand-drawn. They rreally convey the story very well! Most of it was done , I think, to provide anonymity for the women in the stories, but its really done well and also adds to the dramatic way in which the stories are told.",False
7,10,Thank you Vaishnavi,faydent,n/a,15/08/2025,"A long needed investigation into the autogynephilic desire and the impact on women. Again, you explore the issues with sensitivity, as in the dysphoric series. Your work is a much needed voice. Today around the world women are losing their rights. Today you are giving us voices. All women have the right to be heard. The awareness of AGP identity's and its influence on the LGBtq2s so called progressive movement is devastating.This is informative and engaging throughout. The women involved are amazing.I look forward to your future work in exploring the impact and exposing the reality's of self ID and the inevitable effects on women. Your perspective adds great insight to the issues women around the world are facing.Thank you.",False
8,10,"Beautiful and eye opening film on ""trans widows""",ILikeCapybaras,n/a,15/08/2025,"In a world that centres the needs and the perspectives of ""stunning and brave"" trans women, Indian film maker Vaishnavi Sundhar lends a voice to the voiceless, their ex partners and children.Who are the so called ""trans widows""? Women. A young Mom of 4, a professor, a Japanese career woman, a hijabi, a German teacher.Although their lives could not be more diverse, they all tell a similar story: What looks like a beautiful story of ""self discovery"" on the outside is often an abusive relationship with a narcisstic fetishist who puts his desires above the needs of his family. Goes through porn-fuelled binge / purge cycles. Recruits the children as a validation prop.Worse still, unlike other women going through a breakup or a bereavement, the women discover that they are expected not to share their feelings of grief, betrayal and bewilderment - but to act as a human therapy animal to the person formerly known as their husband or father. The stories are cleverly woven together with tidbits on the history of the trans movement and its current incarnation on social media - a poorly disguised celebration of male sexual fantasies, objectifying and appropriating womanhood.Vaishnavi Sundhar's film, not unlike its predecessor ""Dysphoric"", is unique and beautiful in its message of female solidarity in a world that too often tells women that their feelings don't matter. Must watch.",False
9,10,Haunting & beautiful film about an ugly subject,nikkibrown317,n/a,15/08/2025,"A truly fascinating but disturbing subject is explained devastatingly well by the women affected. It's impossible not to feel empathy for the wives & children thrust into a situation which has been so harmful to their wellbeing.Women used to being told to centre the feelings & wants of their husbands/fathers ( men who were often abusive & coersive in private) explain what impact that had on themself & the family as a whole.Whatever your thoughts on the subject of trans identifying men, the voices of their families deserve to be heard & acknowledged. This haunting documentary has finally given them that essential right to reply.",False
10,9,Very moving,janecampaign,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found this quite emotional. These women have suffered so much at the hands of manipulative partners or parents. The stories from around the world show that this is not a localised issue, nor is it rare.I found the voice/gaze of the interviewer to be unobtrusive, and the use of the graphics was great in this regard - the listener was still, and didn't attract any attention, so that was a great device. I felt enough time was spent with each woman to start to get to know their stories, and yet they seemed still representative of a bigger problem.These women have been treated abominably, gaslit by their partners and then by the systems which should have shown empathy for them but which, instead, bolstered their abusers.I thoroughly recommend watching.",False
11,10,Superbly constructed and presented,ayomtov-16393,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm so impressed with the way this film has been put together - the mix of animation (do watch the cats!) and individuals on video, the depth of what is presented from mostly trans widows but also the child of a transitioner. This should be required viewing for anyone even tangentially involved in or affected by the whole issue of transition, to really get to grips with the massive impact this can have on partners and children.To have pulled together such complex material in a way that really brings out the key strands of this devastating subject is extraordinary. Huge congratulations to Vaishnavi Sundar, and to every one of those people involved, in whatever way, with bringing this project to fruition.",False
12,10,Stunning film. A must watch.,loucph,n/a,15/08/2025,"A sensitive and honest film about women faced with husbands who insist they are women. These women and their children are far too often the forgotten victims when a man declares his trans identity.Beautiful illustrations which really helped convey the womens stories, the abuse and gaslighting they and their children are put through.Trans widows are often marginalised and harassed when they speak of their experience. In this film it is all laid out for the world to see.I loved the uplifting stories re connecting with other trans widows, their sisterhood and coming out the other side, stronger and happier.",False
13,10,"Disturbing, but enlightening!",amelvanee,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was necessary in view of the dominant beliefs of the translobby!What actually happens to women and children whose partners/fathers identify as ""women""? A lot of attention is paid to the heroic men who can finally live out ""their true selves"". But what are the consequences for their wives and children? You don't hear anything about that.I am very grateful that women have dared to speak openly about their brutal experiences with transgender ideology. The experiences of these women testify that the women left behind not only suffer massively because of their fetishized partners/fathers, but that they also pose a danger to these women and children. They are subjected to psychological violence, manipulated, psychologically abused and suffer for years to come.Many thanks from Germany to the makers of this documentary! The documentary is a great support in the fight of women and mothers against SelfID and transgenderism!",False
14,10,A huge scandal and an eye opening to the women who are in these abusive relationships,borralhoclaudia,n/a,15/08/2025,It is very hard to listen to all the intensive abuse these women have faced during so many years. They have been abused by narcisits who use them for validation and fetiche while manipulating their children and using them as accessories to hurt their moms and to validate them too. It is a huge scandal and this movie needs to be spread all over as much as we can because these women need to be listen so other women are aware. They give precious advice and refer some organisations that can help them and their kids. It is a precious and very brave documentary. Vaishnavi Sundar was very brave to do this movie and find all these brave women who were brave to speak (even if some of them could not show their faces).,False
15,10,Accurate Presentation of Reality!,carolmoore1776,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was supportive of men into cross dressing etc. In 1996 when I moved in with a man who was honest about his fetish. We did have a relationship for a while. What was true for me in the film was his abusiveness that was based upon a number of psychological problems and delusions, including his frustration with male body and fetishization of having breasts and a woman's body. I was stuck for financial reason, a work for rent situation and chronic illness. The abuse tapered off the first ten year, we became better friends and dog parents. He did ask me to marry him and I refused. He died in 2019 and did leave me a nice inheritance. So at this point I mostly just feel sorry for him.Of course, I really feel for women who find this out later and have kids! So glad to see that whole perspective in the movie! In whatever spectrum of relationship you are in, you will learn a lot from this and gain more confidence to deal with it. It is a good film to learn about the damage selfish transitioning can do to others. Also, men who think you are women and watching it - stop being such selfish jerks. Do your thing, but don't force it on women or wives, especially through force of law. If you think you are a woman you must learn and practice empathy for women.",False
16,10,Vaishnavi Sundar Tells our Stories with True Heart!,leautsira,n/a,15/08/2025,"As one of the trans widows featured, extensively interviewed by Vaishnavi, I knew to expect the harsh realities. I didn't know, until the time when she started her interviews, just how many of us there are and the common patterns in our experiences of financial abuse and our husbands' coercive control over our lives, over our very identities. I still struggle to advise the trans widows who get in touch with me. The fact that Sundar is now releasing the longer form interviews at Lime Soda Films channel adds to her contribution. She spent years recording the avalanche of events and feelings tumbling out, recognized the patterns and created a deeply moving profile of women forging our destinies, despite all odds.Forever grateful, Ute Heggen.",False
17,10,Voice for a silenced group of women,rkzvzqck,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow... I had no idea. Narcissism will take on any form to satisfy its ego.This doco is not a high budget production by any means, but I give it a ten for telling the stories of these women extremely well and for the bravery of the filmmaker for taking on such a sensitive project. I found it really engaging, and I'm normally more of a high-budget kind of movie watcher.It explores the nature of AGP (autogynephilia) which is explained in the film, and how as a form of narcissism it poisons families from the inside out through the very parent who is meant to be a protector. To make matters worse, most of these families have no hope of help because of how society views them, as some sort of heroes on a 'special' journey.",False

Tax Wars poignantly portrays the human cost of corporate tax avoidance, particularly in developing nations struggling with poverty reduction and development. The film's global scope is impressive, offering diverse perspectives from citizens in countries like India, Zambia, and Chile, all grappling with the consequences of tax avoidance in their communities.While advocating for tax justice, the documentary doesn't oversimplify the issue.

The film showcases the burgeoning global movement for tax justice, highlighting the power of collective action. By giving voice to experts, activists, and everyday citizens, Dehli empowers viewers to demand a fairer system for all.Clocking in at a captivating 90 minutes (with a shorter version available), Tax Wars is a thought-provoking and engaging documentary.

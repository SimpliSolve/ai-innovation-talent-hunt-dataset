1,10,Exceptional EDS Documentary!,naolisamit,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've read about Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome before, but did not know how profoundly it can affect someone's life with the excruciating pain that it causes. Watching this helped me understand that. It is a well made film that interviews Mitch's close family members and how they all came to learn about EDS while finding ways to support him.",False
2,10,Fantastic educational resource about EDS,hollyaclayton,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a psychology professor and an EDS researcher. Patients' lived experiences are an important piece of the puzzle when trying to understand the impact a rare condition like this can have on families affected by EDS; this film does just that. Film is a powerful way to spread awareness about a disorder that is frequently stigmatized. Even if you don't have a personal connection to EDS, this piece will evoke strong emotions and hopefully that will motivate others to spread the word, or even get involved with the cause more directly. I have committed to using this film indefinitely in my psychology courses moving forward to enhance lessons about chronic illness.",False
3,10,Must see Documentary,sarah_123987,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is incredibly moving, thought provoking, informative and very well made. It shares the story of someone living with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and discusses important topics like chronic pain, misdiagnosis and mental health. If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend you do!",False
4,10,A Moving EDS Journey,ourlifeisawesome,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cried a dozen times. I finished sentences in the movie. I cringed at the ballet dancer. I can't say enough what a great documentary this is, and so inspiring to those of us who have this dreaded condition. It's also incredibly educational to those of us who don't, or who have an EDS sufferer in their life.Thank you so much for making such a great inspirational film. And a big shout out to Mitch, for sharing this film with me. I've now shared it with over 3000 of my closest friends.",False
5,10,A truly Inspiring Feat of Alturism - Amidst Great Adversity,tash-63521,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary offers incredible insight into the reality of living with, not only EDS but any chronic illness. It's so refreshing & rare to find a film that is this real, educational yet emotional & inspiring.Mitch is so brave & resilient to share a portion of his experience in battling an under- recognised genetic disease.Mitch decided to sacrifice his privacy & risk facing the critics in order to help others.To be in vulnerable situation yourself & decide to share that in order to help others is a truly inspiring feat of alturism that everyone can learn from.Mitch's particular situation offers some very valuable insights, having close family members that are doctors. And I personally love the wise words from his sister who conveys so well the struggle between empathy, indignation at the injustice of gas lighting & understanding what's behind the false assumptions made by many in the general community, who are ignorant to the particular challenges someone with a chronic illness faces. So don't remain ignorant, watch this film, learn and let it inspire you.",True
6,10,A must watch for all people!!,mgreco-09741,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an incredibly informative documentary. It was very well put-together, and it is both emotionally evoking and thought provoking. Now I better understand the seriousness of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, and I commend people like Mitch for remaining strong throughout all these years. I'm super glad he's still with us, too. Given how invisible this incredibly challenging disease is, more people absolutely need to watch this documentary and spread awareness of it, so that more people suffering from this disease can find support and treatment for it. Send the video to everyone you know, it only takes roughly 40 minutes to learn how to better support our fellow brothers and sisters suffering from EDS.",False
7,9,EDS needs to be known like MS and ALS,kfmainey,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very good documentary on what it takes to finally get a diagnosis of EDS. My husband has a similar story and it's been 10 years since diagnosed. He lives in constant pain and has many, many health issues and hence is disabled. His most recent development on top of EDS and Neurocardiogenic Syncope is Sarcoidosis which is an auto-immune lung disease. But he is unbreakable like the movie.This documentary will undoubtably help those who are seeking answers to their own medical mysteries but is also a good way to educate family and friends of those who receive an EDS diagnosis. I stumbled across on youtube but I hope it gets added to something like Netflix.",False
8,10,Dare to care?,love_kitty_cats,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Bend or Break documentary is widely considered ""required material"" for those recently diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (along with their caregivers, friends, and family). It follows the life and loved ones of Mitch Martow, a now young-man diagnosed with EDS after years of medical gaslighting, medical narcissism, and just plain old incompetence and unknowing.No one expects all medical professionals to know about all conditions. But we should be able to expect compassion, diligence, and dignity - 100% of the time. Sadly, the oft-ubiquitous experience of EDS patients being mistreated, disbelieved, and misdiagnosed, remains the norm.",False
9,9,Real Life Journey Inspires and Educates Viewers,robmorton-42595,n/a,16/08/2025,"Huge thanks for Mitch Martow and his entire family for sharing a.journey of emotional and physical pain; and a journey of discovery. It was well produced and incredibly informative. I knew nothing about EDS before I watched it and the documentary unfolds as Mitch lives it every day. The first part, for the viewer, parallels the frustration of not knowing what was causing the pain and in a way, as you view it, the frustration is palpable. And the second half, through the descriptions of the entire Martow family, deals with learning to understand the disease itself. I recommend this to all those who suffer every day and to everyone who will face a medical trauma in the future.",False
10,10,"Informative, captivating, well made documentary",julesgittleson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Accurately depicts the hardships and struggles one has to go through when living with an 'invisible illness'.Highly recommended to anyone looking to learn about living with EDS. This documentary outlines the life of Mitch Martiw, a male with EDS and his journey from symptomatic onset to diagnosis.I cannot stress this enough... this documentary accurately provides the viewer a realistic snapshot of what it is like to live with a chronic, debilitating illness.We need more films like this... films like this have the ability to stir up much needed discussion within the general publicThis documentary is powerful, thought provoking and inspiring! As someone with EDS, I now resort to providing people with a link to this documentary whenever someone asks what condition I have.This is the only documentary/film I've ever come across that accurately depicts chronic illness in such a raw, visceral manner.",False
11,10,Excellent documentary,Shayztar,n/a,16/08/2025,This was an excellent documentary outlining the experiences of one man and his journey to a diagnosis of a rare disease. His fight lead to the creation of a fundamental program to be built for other canadians who struggle. It also highlights other people's journey towards diagnosis. Very sensitive material is discussed.,False
12,10,Helpful and well done,jessicamaclean-77369,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an incredibly helpful and necessary documentary. Very well done! As someone with EDS, I finally feel more seen. I just wish this film were added to Netflix so more people would see it and understand some of this complicated condition. EDS is too complicated (and different for every zebra, just like a zebra's stripes) to be covered in one documentary, so I hope people understand that fact and try to be open minded. This documentary has the potential to open the door for EDS awareness. Healthcare employees should watch the film as well. Thank you so much for sharing your story with all of us!",False

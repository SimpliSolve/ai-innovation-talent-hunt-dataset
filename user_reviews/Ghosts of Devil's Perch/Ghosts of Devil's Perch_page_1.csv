1,7,Not a 10 not a 1,victor-astrom,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you can by the premise, the fact that it's a show about ghosts, then you're going to have a good time. Like the Holzer files this is very much a mystery that spans over eight episodes and it gets resolved, so there is no annoying cliff hanger.The show has a little bit of everything a bit ghost hunting, history and a bit detective show. As much as a ghost show can makes sense, this one does. It easy to follow, things makes sense and the show has good pacing. It's perfect when you just want to watch something that isn't filled with drama or something stressed out.The team is great with great personalities and they have gods chemistry.",False
2,5,Apparently is a series with CONTINUATION so why does it air out of order??,imdb-25288,n/a,16/08/2025,"Where the hell is Devil's Perch? I have no idea why 1 reviewer claims UK as they all (thankfully) speak normal English. That's USA English to ya! The show is difficult to follow because it is so unbearably boring. Not only that, first time I've ever caught it and it's aired out of order?! UGH!!!There was 1 episode where they go to this old lady's house, the one who says she was woken up by a presence suffocating her, and they capture a paranormal occurence: how come this never made the news? Or, at the very least, Paranormal Caught on Camera? But nope. You're minding your own business when, all of a sudden, the closet door slides open by itself! WOW! The only problem with that?? Cindy Kaza ran outta there, like a girl, making me question what kind of ""I talk to the dead and they talk back to me"" Medium would be spooked senseless by a REAL ghost actually trying to COMMUNICATE with her when that's all this show is about!? HELLO! Yet, she acted like I did when I was a ghost virgin and had my 1st paranormal encounter. WHO does that? Lady, it's YOUR JOB! Man up, dude! Yet, she proclaims she's not feeling safe. Mm-kay. Yeah, you're a psychic who talks to ghosts yet you run at the 1st non-staged REAL ghostly occurence? Perchance, could have I been duped thinking this one was genuine?? You won't catch me running away: having lived with the stuff in 2 different places, there's very little that can spook me. Yet, she wasn't even touched! Ok, lady: medium?? I'll have to rethink that! Speaking of whom...!Cindy Kaza and her cheesy modern Geisha look is giving me physical negative symptoms with her gross misuse of black & red! Lady: either show up with a Falmenco dress and speak with a Spanish accent or find the proper colors to represent Japan! I mean whoever told her either of those 2 colors look good on her lied to her! WHY is it ok for her to culturally appropriate Japan culture?? I can't call her ""White girl"" because she cakes the white paint on, and with her many plastic surgeries, it's hard to figure out her original ethnicity, but Japanese she ain't! Yet, the lady masquerades as one, with her powdered rice-White face, a beehive mop of jet-black hair coiffed into a Japanese bun, annoyingly nonstop swinging oversized earrings (UGH!!! She making me sea-sick, y'all!), fire-engine caked-on lisptick that makes her lips look parched and the worst? She's now taken to wearing Japanese kimonos over her goth black clothes. What the what?? At least, she's spared us the pillow fastened at her back and the wood sandals, whew! :)This is a real pity, because I like Cindy. She's got a pleasant personality, and UNTIL NOW, she's never given me reason to believe she's anything but the real deal, she has a good camera presence...but her look! I get that she doesn't like the natural look but she's painful to look at. She's like the Dolly Parton of ghosts except less pleasant to look at. Much, much less! And way more contrived. I don't get people doing the opposite of beautifying themselves for attention.Would someone please hook her up with Susan Slaughter?? The latter is radically opposite of her, yet still (but much less) annoying: she's constantly changing her look. You have no time to get used to one because she's already changed it. Black to platinum hair and vice versa. Maybe Cindy needs Tabasco sauce-box orange hair? I don't know. I think she'd look better in electric blue clothes, and still have the ""LOOK AT ME, I WEAR BRIGHT COLORS"" yet less offensively.Like I said, the show is hard to follow because it is so boring, low production values, and Cindy's very distracting look. Can someone please tell her to remove her silly earrings before somebody yanks them off. Maybe buy her a couple studs, pearls, jade, or whatever doesn't move oncamera and call it a day? Then tone the look down from there. She's no spring chicken and I hope she doesn't go the way of Mick Jagger or Angelyne, stuck with the one passe' look that is 7 seasons out of fashion.5/10 because it's boring but they did have the one ghost opening door so that's good. Please remember: you are on camera to ENTERTAIN us, not deliver the ghost news and not here to make us seasick with your dumb earrings in perpetual swinging motion.",False
3,1,I Got Goosebumps...because it was so stupid.,holzerfilestv,n/a,16/08/2025,"It seems like The Travel Channel prefers to use talent that is horrendous on camera so that the audience doesn't look up their imdb, see that the talent has actor credits, and think the person is just ""acting"" on their shows. The on screen takes are bad enough, but the pick ups are so embarrassing to witness. It takes you completely out of the moment and makes you question how the people involved with these shows aren't cringing, knowing an audience....albeit a dwindling audience, is watching. Sure, some may question the credibility of the paranormal (in the show) if they see the talent has acting credits. But I think the credibility is even more in question when the talent is so unnatural that you can tell they are being fed lines....because if that part is scripted, what else in the show is? And yes, every ""reality show"" has scripted elements, it's the only way to make the story go from ""A"" to ""B"". However The Travel Channel's current ""A"" to ""B"" is taking an ""Average"" show and making it a ""Bad"" show.",False
4,9,Enjoyable viewing,duncany123,n/a,16/08/2025,"I see some people have given this show low ratings. Its not made by professional actors, but rather a team of paranormal investigators who are trying their very best to provide evidence of the paranormal for us. I take the show for what it is, not what it isn't or what people think it should be.The show does have dramatised segments to show the viewers of a persons paranormal experience for example. I don't have a problem with this, it makes me feel like I have experienced what the person has (I have had paranormal experiences myself).These shows are hit and miss for people I'm guessing, but really I'm enjoying it. The evidence they produce seems genuine in my opinion. I also love learning history of places I have never been too and will most likely never visit so that is a nice and thoughtful aspect of this show.If you enjoy paranormal shows its really worth a watch, the same with Holzer files which Dave was a part of too along with Cindy.My advice, take this show for what it is intended to be and not for something it isn't, with that perspective you might enjoy it more!",False
5,1,What is this supposed to be?,jfost75,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a world saturated with shows about the paranormal, this show is definitely nothing original. The premise of the show seems to be the authorities of a MT town call in a team of ""paranormal investigators"" to figure out the paranormal activity being experienced (pretty much in queue) by the residents.What's unclear is whether this is supposed to be a scripted show? The way the cast speaks, along with the almost on-demand appearance of activity feels more like a B-movie than an actual paranormal investigation.For those familiar with paranormal shows, the cast is familiar, however the (bad) acting makes this entire endeavor feel like a ""mockumentary""",False
6,9,Great show!,bobby-48368,n/a,16/08/2025,"With the cast from The Holzer Files (the main 2) Yes there's bad ""acting"" because they're not actors! Awesome and exciting! A continuation of Ghosts Of Series ( 3rd in the series) . They capture some really cool paranormal activity in a historical town in Montana. If you're into all the paranormal shows like Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures etc.. then check this show out! You'll definitely like it! I gave it a 9 out of 10 because nothing is perfect! We watched on Discovery+ network. We binge watched up to episode 3 and are caught up! Can't wait for the next episode! Great to watch with Halloween coming! Along with scary movies, we love to watch these type of shows to get into the spooky feeling of the Halloween season! So if you're into that, this show will definitely do the trick! See what I did there? Lol but seriously, watch at night in the dark! You will not be disappointed!",False
7,1,So bad it's hilarious,ybgfdmsqn,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is so obviously fake and scripted it's pathetic! But it's so bad it's hilarious to watch! They may want to get the three ""investigators "" some basic acting lessons.The police make fools of themselves working with this alleged paranormal team. Hopefully they get the publicity and tourist's they are so desperate for.What's the next city that's going to have an upswing in paranormal activity that miraculously occurs when our team of fearless ghost hunters are around. Get your requests in now!The ghosts and spirits must be quaking in their shrouds at the thought of the three stooges of the paranormal hunting them down.",False
8,8,Seen Worse,dibsrogers,n/a,16/08/2025,"This isn't a bad show but it come now that what are people's expectations of a show.Ghosts don't do things on camera for people's entertainment.I always keep a open mind on These shows.What do people actually want to see, every crew member in each room filming so something might happen only for the armchair critic to say nah its all setup etc, why domt the armchair brigade get up off their asses and go to the places then say it's fake or acted etc.Bear in mind these shows are to entertain and maybe enlighten you what goes on a ghost hunt or something.The saying goes, never work with ghosts or entity's as they never show up or do what you want them to do while your filming lol.",False
9,2,Same old dramatised nonsense.....,Ghostofthewoods,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was hoping for something different, but in reality, we're presented with the same old overly dramatised 'ghost show' that features a psychic who is constantly surprised by her own 'abilities' a 'tech' guy and Dave Schrader, who I once had a lot of respect for, as I thought he was genuine. Dave Schrader always asked great questions and hunted for truth, but he seems to have sold out in order to get onto TV (I guess we all have bills to pay). This show is aimed at the non-scientific, thrill a minute audience that have the attention span of a gnat. I wish my review wasn't as scathing, but this has been my finding thus far......I just WISH some of these guys could put their heads together and come up with a genuine show. We don't all need constant and orchestrated paranormal activity to keep us entertained....",False
10,1,So fake it's incredible.,lucas-cleroux,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a town trying to lure more people to come over to see fake ghost and to make money. And that woman that sense bad spirits she is hilarious. She knows everything by going into the house. It's entertaining but it make you tick off with stupidity they do. I believe they are using breaking bad rv also...............................................................................................600 characters to go.

11,1,nothing to see,gmanmeacham,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yet another rubbish paranormal show. The usual suspects, so called medium or psychic, unexplained noise, shadows, jumping to conclusions with no real evidence. Hilarious, but unintentionally so. Oh. To Bobby the reviewer who gave this a 9/10.you are either connected to the show in some way or are really gullible. Emf meters are for use in engineering and there is no proof whatsoever that they detect the presence of so called ghosts. It is all pseudo science.buy the sheer amount of paranormal shows that all seem to detect some prescence or anomaly, it would appear there is life after death and we have nothing to worry about in life!",False
12,2,I tried..,dancingtreespirits,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNonsense! I really tried to watch this show. I got hyped up and excited for it. The show includes Cindy, whom I started to like when she would pop in and guest star on another show I like. But with having Dave and him being a not so great actor, you can just tell the show is fake. As you try to get into the show and ignore that, you would see all the edits and add ins. It's not real. And IF something really did happen you see how excited they would get. And every show they get alot of information all leading up to this big, bad dark force. Let me guess... On the big finale, they find out who that is or something really big happens with the dark force leader. Smh.. if people are really having problems in this town. It's the weirdest looking empty town I've ever seen.",True
13,1,Not good,dfroese-25475,n/a,16/08/2025,"I must say I had never heard of Dave Schrader before The Holzer Files. I enjoyed that show. When I heard about Devil's Perch it was definitely something I wanted to watch. I didn't know who KD was but after watching a couple episodes of Devil's Perch I knew he was really trying to produce evidence that wasn't there. The fact that these ""ghosts"" respond right on que, every time, is very suspect. I agree with another's assessment that he is trying to be like Zac Bagans, and that is not a person you want to aspire to be! The next thing that turned me off was Dave pretending that a ghost knocked him down and him crying out. It made me laugh!! And Cindy Kaza is just ridiculous. She is so scripted and you know she's been coached on what to say.It's sad that they had to script the show rather than do a good ghost hunt. You will lose good viewers that way.",False
14,1,The world's most haunted town ever,lutonparanormal,n/a,16/08/2025,America is a couple of hundred years old with ghosts everywhere in that case here in the UK with thousands of years of history we must be overrun with ghosts next up devil's perch UK this show is all about money in pockets like all paranormal shows as most paranormal investigators know often nothing happens on investigation but that would not make good TV ratings would it or sell merchandise. I nothing against this team but are they just trying to out Zak Zak bagans it appears to becoming a competition between TV producers to come up with something that sells rather than something closer to reality.,False
15,4,Good medium participating,hilde-107-156740,n/a,16/08/2025,"The medium in the series is credible and has the right attitude and humble and respectful way of communicating with the other side.As in many of these series there are some guys participating that seems to be very afraid of the other side, and that has to drag a lot of fear and darkness into it. Addressing the spirits in often very disrespectful and commanding/leading ways that often cut off the communication. Because of it. Asking the spirits if they are the dark one, the evil one reciding here etc. Knowning the spirit world you would know that treating them like this just pisses them off. They need help, good communication and understanding of their position, to be freed. Not condemnation.",False
16,1,So embarassing! WTF?,rockyrose-31134,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this 8th grade student film when it first came out and I was horrified. I recently went on a ""ghost tour"" given by one of the locals featured, had plenty of questions & was basically told that I don't know anything. I was born and raised in Butte, know just as much about Butte history and believe in paranormal. This abomination makes me embarassed to say I'm from the community. Total pile of horsesh!#. Complete misrepresentation, some outright lies and all of these people were on board to sling this nonsense. I especially enjoyed when they claim to have released a spirit at the Clark Chateau....while standing in a bathroom. Any ghost would be proud. There was an actual confirmed death in the house that was not ever ""felt"" or mentioned by this elite team of ghost hunters. When I asked the guide about it, he claims he knew about it but wasn't mentioned because ""that's not what we were looking for"". It was a 16 year old boy, John Stanwood Murray and it begs the question, how did you know what you were looking for? Apparently it wasn't written in the script. That's not the only thing, Herb Sargent lived in the Hennessey Mansion while in college. He graduated in 1968 moved out and lived a very quiet life until 1977 and then flipped out. No correlation to the Hennessey Mansion whatsoever. Willie Corette fell into a mine shaft that was nowhere near the Hennessey Mansion. I could go on and on but you get it. My favorite part was when Fisk says every year 100 students sleep at the Cabbage Patch to see what is was like to live homeless back in that era. They're given a box and a tarp. My question would be, who do I need to talk to about getting sturdy box and heavyweight tarp? This is not a thing. Three of my children went to Butte High School where Mr. Fisk teaches and this overnight fairy tale has never happened. The Cabbage Patch contained very shanty living quarters, but they were living quarters. People weren't homeless. Also, I would love to know how his premise of being homeless back then would be any different than being homeless now. It's shameful. Anyway I give it two enthusiastic thumbs down and wish I had more thumbs to represent how I feel. F#@k!",True

1,7,Exposing Brandy Melville AND the culture of waste,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Brandy Hellville & The Cult of Fast Fashion"" (2024 release; 92 min) opens, we hear from a young woman, talking about her first purchase at Brandy Mellville when she was a 7th grader. We then go back in time to learn about the origins of the company, with its Italian founder Stephen Marsan quickly focusing in on the US market despite not speaking English whatsoever. At this point we are 10 minutes in the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from Oscar-winning producer-writer-director Eva Orner (""Taxi to the Dark Side""). Here she pulls back the curtain on a company that became a phenom for teenage girls (core focus on 14-15-16 year olds). Also how skinny white teenage girls (preferable with blond hair and blue eyes) were the key focus for store employees. Then it gets much worse, including among others blatant anti-Semitism among the company management. The documentary also addresses the waste crisis resulting from fast fashion. The footage from Ghana is shocking, to say the least. (Note that this waste crisis is also addressed in another recent documentary called ""Buy Now: The Shopping Conspiracy"".) Combine off of these separate but related issues, and this makes for very sobering viewing, and then some.""Brandy Hellville & The Cult of Fast Fashion"" premiered at this year's South by Southwest festival, to immediate acclaim. This documentary is currently rated 100% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, which seems quite generous to me. This is now streaming on Max, where I saw it the other night. If you have any interest in Brandy Melville's business practices or in the crisis of waste, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
2,5,got better over time,wiwtbytmlamotl,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well it was. Good. But it was too slow and most of the girls were annoying. It was good to watch but there were parts that actually made me hate brandy Melville. It is good to educate you but it is also really boring and made me want to punch the screen. It's gonna get repetitive here because I still have three hundred letters left. I would reccomend if you want to learn, but if you have anger issues I would find something else. The girls were saying annoying things in an annoying way. I really don't know what else to say, but I thought it was bad at first. It got good near the end. It felt really long.",False
3,5,Interesting but not super engaging.,cb_whitewood,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've only heard of Brandy Melville in discussions of past fashion trends... but I always love a good documentary.I think this documentary covered all that it needed to, but still fell a bit flat for me. I understood the hype sustained by teenage girls, the strangely predatory business practices that went unnoticed, the casual racism... but it was all ""tell"" and very little ""show."" Maybe it was just not possible, but I think lots of more interesting incidents could be found via social media where people regularly ""expose"" others, such as Tiktok. You're telling me there were no recorded incidents of discrimination/bad attitude from sales reps/etc anywhere???Obviously those who worked closely for this brand are still suffering the repercussions of that, and I'm not aiming to minimize, but I don't think this film conveyed the impact well enough. Overall an interesting watch, but no re-watch value here in my opinion.",False
4,4,Nothing a youtube deep dive hasn't already said.,iamatriangle,n/a,16/08/2025,"To be completely honest, there was nothing much of substance here. The expos√© failed to really expose anything that hasn't already been said on youtube. I mean really, it felt almost like they'd just watched a youtube video and threw it together particularly when the subplot (an overall criticism of fast fashion and consumerism) felt detached from the brandy section in any way other then the fact brandy is fast fashion. I also felt that they glossed over a lot of details they could have further analysed such as the whole apartment saga and the fact the owner is allegedly a p***phile. Overall a half baked documentary.",False
5,1,A Nontroversy,pzamost,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe tired phrase ""Keep moving folks there's nothing here to see "" is for once appropriate in regards to Brandy Hellville.This farce of a documentary about teen girls obsession with the clothing brand Brandy Melville does more to promote the brand than disgrace it.Brandy Melvile cleverly became a fashion phenomenon by marketing to teenage girls as do many others but BM didn't hide the fact that their main target was tall thin pretty white girls and shunned the other demographics. The documentary tries to make the company look nefarious but fails to make a legitimate case.The doc briefly touches on the fact that the fast fashion industry creates mountains of waste that ends up getting shipped to 3rd world countries, this would of made for a much better documentary than the 90 minutes of thin pretty white girls complaining that they think they were exploited.... The Irony.",True
6,10,Very Insightful documentary into the global impact of fast fashion,thaspius,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCorporations preying on young women and their desire to be trendy, resulting in Chinese sweat shops in Italy of all places, massive dumping grounds and water pollution via microplastics, and throw in corporate racism, sexual abuse, and antisemitism. The show exposed a lot more than I was expecting and the massive global impact these corporate practices have. I thoroughly enjoyed the narrative flow of the documentary and how it guides the viewer from a start that seems like a fairly innocuous new brand with unusual marketing practices with an all Instagram marketing strategy and largely self taken photos by eager young customers.Certainly not a trivial problem and it is negatively impacting 10s of thousands if not 100s of thousands of people globally. The folks giving poor reviews clearly didn't watch the entire movie.",True
7,2,Zero point.,Roberthmyers33,n/a,16/08/2025,"There wasn't a need for this. Clothes are cheap and disposable but everyone in this is or was totally on board for it. Until they weren't a part of it.This wants to be ""White Hot: Abercrombie"" from two years ago so bad you can taste it.Old guys make tasteless and wildly inappropriate jokes on a private text chain- shocking to no one.People are hired and fired based on surface level appearance- live by the sword die by the sword.This is a faux doc for the self obsessed that parades out a pastiche of green concern for the earth, or something. None of these people care even a little bit.Nothing new and nothing even remotely surprising to be had here.",False
8,3,Muckraking at its Laziest,johnspringer-95440,n/a,16/08/2025,"The people behind this documentary definitely want you to be outraged. They're just not entirely clear on what they want you to be outraged about. So the series takes a scattershot approach, throwing everything at the wall and hoping something will stick. There are indictments of demographically-targeted marketing, social media promotion, the fashion industry generally and fast fashion in particular. The approach is broad rather than deep, and devoid of any serious investigation or revelatory insights. Apparently the filmmakers thought that stacking a bunch of nothingburgers together would make a meal, but very little in this supposed expose merits more than a shrug.",False
9,10,Don't Listen to the Negative Reviews,tommierubatino,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't usually write reviews on here, but as a father with teenage daughters, this felt important. A lot of reviews on here are complaining about nonsense. This is an eye opening documentary. Everyone needs to see this to understand that the price of the clothes that we wear is so much more than what's on the price tag.This should be required viewing for all teenagers. As a high school teacher, I have seen firsthand how detrimental the mentalities that fast fashion push are to our young people. This is important filmmaking.The pacing is compelling, the interviews are enlightening, and the overall message is everything a documentary should be: sobering and ultimately helpful.Do yourself a favor and watch.",False
10,1,Thoughtless and boring ...otherwise the dumbest doc of all time,steven-58520,n/a,16/08/2025,"To sum up it's very, very, boring...This isn't really about Brandy Melville and there isn't any investigation or journalism.It was clever, in a morally corrupt kind of way to use the positive Brandy Melville Brand to promote a film that is negative about Brandy Melville. This method show the depth of personality of the director/authors. I'm sad for their parents.To be generous this is a super boring waste of time. It drones on repeating itself over and over and over again...The movie can be summed up in 4 words:
Retail consumption is bad.Imagine making the most generic and thoughtless statements like everything potentially bad about clothing, business, and teenagers. Said in a sad boring un thought-provoking mentally corrupt kind of way.",False
11,1,1 Because 0 Isn't An Option-,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"~*INCLUSIVITY! BODY POSITIVE! NO SHAME GAME!*~I should have known. Except I don't have preteen/teen girls, so the brand has flown under the radar for me. Never heard of them, never have seen a brick and mortar store front, seen an ad, nothing. So I was initially intrigued by a doc about a clothing brand and came in, open mind, ready to view.Despite the insane number of negative reviews, I still wanted to give it a fair chance- and I usually will casually see what kind of a rating something gets before viewing- not because I will/won't watch, but I try and temper expectations.Started off with a bad taste immediately. These girls/women seems so obtuse- like they're paid stans for the brand. Yammering and stammering, tripping all over each other to gush all over this brand and practically wax philosophical on it. So I get it- you want the viewer immediately smacked in the face with the feeling of cultish, syndromic programming. Then in swoops the 'journalist'. Just in case you are one of the cult members, or maybe you think 'huh this brand is cute, looks affordable and seems like my kinda vibe, she's here to tell you they ARE NOT politically correct and their target audience is unfair!!I'll let you in on a few secrets and hopefully future filmmakers are paying attention: most people are absolutely disgusted with 'cancel culture' and are now going out of their way to support decent companies/people who do nothing wrong but for some reason, some of the people in the outrage mob were offended. So this machine starts to roll along, except now it's getting incredibly cumbersome. What used to evoke fear and cowering by people has slowly switched over to anger/outrage, and companies who choose not to 'bend the knee' are beginning to be rewarded with even more business if they stand their ground and refuse to apologize.The economy is an horrific train wreck- nobody has money, can barely swing rent/house payments, grocery prices have increased by triple, and inflation is like an overinflated balloon that ready to pop at any moment. If there's clothing brands that offer us an option that looks good, is affordable and ships directly? Not even a seconds delay deciding whether or not there's a purchase to be made. There's brands available anymore for every body type, size and shape. So this brand happens to cater to a demo of thin teens, there's other brands doing so for big gals, big guys, small guys, muscular guys and gals, etc.If this doc was meant to repel, it's having the opposite effect- look at the BM stans on IMDb smacking any negative review down and you'll see what I mean. I couldn't even get past halfway before I finally turned it off. There's got to be much better products out there for documentarians to take on and streamers to fund.",False
12,8,Better than expected,kelleymiller,n/a,16/08/2025,"The negative reviews are over the top. I found this to be an insightful documentary. I'm glad they didn't censure or coach any of the girls who were interviewed... they were fully themselves. Any complaints that the girls were annoying... is honestly stupid to say here in a review. That's your personal opinion about real people who were not scripted... this is not a fictional movie. This is about a fairly controversial clothing brand that's geared toward teenage girls... not about underpaid librarians or something... Get a grip.I very much appreciated and enjoyed this documentary. I had no idea about Brandy Melville previously. I will gladly discourage my niece from ever shopping there, too. The CEO is a toxic pig.",False
13,8,Was that Dustin Milligan?,coffeegirljlh,n/a,16/08/2025,"When they show the Toronto store opening in 2012 was that Dustin Milligan announcing the opening? He's not in the credits, looks a lot like him but the cast list isn't complete.This was very informative and eye-opening, hopefully people will watch and see what happens to ""Fast Fashion"" clothing, how the young women were treated and how the trend of their clothing to make the average woman think that they are supposed to be ""one-size-fits-all"" in our society because this is so harmful to anyone's mindset but more so for teenage girls. Companies like this need to be responsible, respectable and culturally aware.",False

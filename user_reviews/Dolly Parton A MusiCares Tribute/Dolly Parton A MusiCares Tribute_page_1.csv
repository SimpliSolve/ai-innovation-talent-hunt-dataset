1,8,Just what the doctor ordered,pmtelefon,n/a,16/08/2025,"I made the mistake the other night of watching ""Mother's Day"" (1980). I should have known better. ""Mother's Day"" is a mean, ugly movie. It left a bad taste in my mouth. It was late but I didn't want to end my night on such an ugly note. I needed to find something life affirming to watch before I went to bed. When I came across ""Dolly Parton: A MusiCares Tribute"" I knew I found what I needed. This concert film did not disappoint. The songs are great. You can tell that the other artists on stage all have great affection for Dolly. I watched this movie and all of the negativity I was exposed to in ""Mother's Day"" washed away. I slept like a baby.",False
2,10,DOLLY PARTON! A Queen of all!,lovettstough,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love DOLLY PARTON! A lot of the people in this singing her songs should NOT have done it they sounded that terrible and horrible. The only ones who sounded good singing DOLLY's songs were CAM, KACEY MUSGRAVES, and MILEY CYRUS. The people who sang with these three sounded terrible and horrible. DOLLY sings her song that she wrote and sang first ""I Will Always Love You"" best. Somebody in YOUTUBE comments started a debate with me on this saying Whitney did. Whitney sang it okay but not as good as DOLLY. Whitney sang it for a movie soundtrack and she did not have the emotion or the feelings or any of that to go with it when she sang it. To Whitney it was just a cover song she did for a movie soundtrack. Dolly wrote this song about a real life experience of hers to help her and another deal with this real life experience. Dolly started on the Porter Wagoner Television Show. DOLLY and Porter were the best of friends, very close, nothing romantic but very close. When DOLLY was ready and wanted to leave to start and or continue a solo career Porter was not angry at all but he was extremely saddened and upset and broken hearted naturally and DOLLY knew this so the last thing she did was write her song "" I Will Always Love You"" for him and she sang it to Porter Wagoner and it was extremely emotional and painful and had all those different feels and everything in there when she sang it to him. If you were to ask DOLLY PARTON about this she will tell you the same true story and there is even an old video showing her singing this to him on his show. DOLLY said it was her way of saying goodbye but she would always love him.",False
3,1,"Dolly is incredible, this isn't.",kat-hall,n/a,16/08/2025,I couldn't even make it past the preview because the so-called tribute singers were butchering her work so badly (Islands in the stream).,False
4,5,I love Dolly!!,trashcanracer,n/a,16/08/2025,"And she deserves ALL the accolades, so it was disappointing to see musical artists paying tribute to this living legend (who supposedly ""worship"" her), but didn't know the words to her songs. Aside from Chris Stapleton (his song was easy: 9 to 5) and Leon Bridges (kudos to this genuine artist!), every one of them had to constantly look down at the teleprompter to make sure they were singing the songs correctly. Come on, it's Dolly!!",False
5,1,Disappointed,tomandlouann,n/a,16/08/2025,The singing was pretty good. What made me a little sad was when the camera panned over to Dolly and she looked like she didn't want to be there and was not impressed with any of the singers.,False
6,5,Disappointing,TapiaJorgeJ,n/a,16/08/2025,Where were Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood performing Old Flames? Or Vince Gill and Don Henley doing Eagle When She Flies? Or Pink performing Jolene? These performances were cut out of the show - very disappointing and nonsensical.,False

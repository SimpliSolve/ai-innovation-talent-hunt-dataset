1,8,A great idea and the people that believed,Mr-Fusion,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sesame Street is an institution nowadays, but it wasn't an easy sell. This is that story, how one person (Joan Ganz Cooney) saw the TV as an opportunity to bring education to the disadvantaged . . . With the help of Muppets.And it's a moving one. The filmmakers highlight the key personnel involved in the crafting of the show; sure, Jim Henson is a star player, but I loved seeing his dynamic with Frank Oz (real life Bert and Ernie! ) and it hasn't been touched on on the docs I've seen up to this point. Even more so the coverage of Joe Raposo, the man behind all of our favorite songs.This is a thoughtful, honest work that hit me right in the solar plexus; and such positivity is ever fleeting in this world.",False
2,8,Can you tell me how ...,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Kermit the Frog. Bert and Ernie. Big Bird. Cookie Monster. Abby Cadabby. Grover. Oscar the Grouch. Guy Smiley. Mr. Snuffleupagus. Prairie Dawn. The Two-Headed Monster. Elmo. Count Von Count (The Count is my personal favorite). What a lineup of characters ... each with their own personality and look, and every one designed to appeal to kids and help educate. It's been more than 50 years since ""Sesame Street"" first hit the TV airwaves, and filmmaker Marilyn Agrelo (MAD HOT BALLROOM, 2005) uses Michael Davis' book, ""Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street"" as a guide to this personal peek behind the curtain, and a look at the folks who made the show such a success.The four main drivers responsible for the show were Joan Ganz Cooney, Lloyd Morrisett, Jon Stone, and Jim Henson. Ms. Cooney and Mr. Morrisett co-founded the Children's Television Workshop, which led to the research and funding necessary to kick off ""Sesame Street"", the show. Ms. Cooney brought on Mr. Stone to develop and produce the programming, and of course, Mr. Henson, the creator of the Muppets and ""Fraggle Rock"" was the master puppeteer who was with the project from its inception in 1969.The background information is quite interesting. Morrisett recalls hearing his 3 year old daughter singing beer jingles she had memorized from watching TV. He instinctively knew TV was making an impact and could be better utilized. Cooney talks about her initial business plan and how, at the time, a woman wasn't going to be accepted as the face of an innovative program - risky for investors and networks. We also see many clips of Stone and Henson at work on set, and numerous people offer perspective on the creativity and effort that went into those early years. In fact, the film opens with a look at the 1981 New York City set as an episode is being filmed. Some of the cast members interviewed include Roscoe Ormon (Gordon), Sonia Manzano (Maria), and Bob McGrath (Bob).With an early emphasis on providing educational programming for minority and inner city kids, we hear of Mississippi's refusal to air the program due to minority cast members. The focus on 3 to 5 year olds was revolutionary at the time, and the societal benefits of injecting fun into learning was immense, though brilliantly, the creators made it interesting for adults as well. Filmmaker Agrelo has much to cover here, and does a nice job segmenting so that each piece of the Sesame Street puzzle is clear. The focus is on the early years (pre-Elmo). The dynamics of Frank Oz and Jim Henson as master puppeteers is a joy to behold, while Joe Raposo and Christopher Cerf offer perspective on the frantic pace to generate the music necessary for each episode ... including the ""lawsuit"" involved with ""Letter B"".As with any educational efforts, but especially those with an entertainment push, addressing the difficult and uncomfortable issues is critical. We hear about the iconic segment where the characters deal with Mr. Hooper's death in the 1980's. Even today, it's held up as the standard for helping kids deal with death. Jim Henson's unexpected death at age 53 in 1990 is also discussed, and clips from that funeral will likely bring a tear to your eye. Big Bird singing Kermit's signature song, ""Bein' Green"" got to me. There is a bit on Carroll Spinney (Big Bird and Oscar), who passed away just over a year ago, and all of the key characters get their moment.This is an HBO Documentary and Chicken Soup for the Soul production, and it's an enlightening 'behind-the-scenes' look at the visionaries responsible for this groundbreaking, Emmy and Peabody award-winning show that probably saved public television. So my advice is to ""Put down the Ducky"" and give this documentary a watch. It's sure to take you to where ""the air is sweet.""
The film will be released in theaters on April 23, 2021 and On Demand on May 7, 2021.",False
3,8,Street Knowledge,ThatMonkey,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have seen a few Documentaries on S2. Most have focused on JH or particular cast members. This is the first I have seen about the people who created the show.It shows how the creators decided on inclusion. While other shows only had white cast members and guests, S2 made sure every child could recognize themselves in one form or fashion.It also showed the push back for non inclusive people and places. As well as the blinding effects of what tobacco and alcohol marketing was having on children of the 60's.This is a great legacy piece that showcases the care and joy that went into many of our most vivid pre-teen memories.",False
4,10,A strong contender for Best Documentary Feature,soulexpress,n/a,16/08/2025,"I last watched ""Sesame Street"" when I was eight years old; I'm now 55. But even after all this time, I take its lessons to heart. Besides, you don't have to have grown up on the show to appreciate this fine chronicle of its history and influence.I could go on for several paragraphs about why this movie works, but I'll simply say that STREET GANG does for ""Sesame Street"" what WON'T YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR did for ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" in 2018. I give it my highest recommendation.",False
5,7,Good but lacking a bit,RonDirect73,n/a,16/08/2025,"The content of the Street Gang is immensely enjoyable. The history of Sesame Street is a fascinating story and there's plenty of entertaining material included here.Being the huge fan of the show that I am I would have liked to seen a few more areas covered. It didn't shy away from the behind-the-scenes antics of the Muppet performers which was wonderful to see. I wished they had featured more of the players outside of Henson and Oz, both the puppet performers and human actors. And I would've liked if the creators had gotten into role of actor Northern Calloway more, who played David, a very likable screen presence whose erratic behavior off screen got him fired from the show (his life ended tragically).Still this is a good documentary that is definitely worth watching.",False
6,7,Insightful look back a the beginnings of Sesame Street,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs ""Street Gang; How We got to Sesame Street"" (2021 release; 106 min.) opens, it is ""New York CIty, 1981"", and we get a glimpse of the program being produced: there is Joan Cooney, who came up with the idea in the mid-60s for a kids shows aimed at the underprivileged inner-city (read; mostly Black) kids aged 3 to 5, and Jon Stone, the director who is determined to not talk down to kids or, worse--selling stuff to kids (cereal, toys, etc.). And then there are the main puppeteers, Jim Henson and Frank Oz, whose talents are obvious... At this point we are 10 min. Into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Marilyn Agrelo, who seemingly is given unfettered access to the Sesame Street achieve footage and ""street gang"" (i.e. The production staff and performers). There are some interesting titbits in this documentary: first and foremost, the active political considerations that went into it. Cooney was actively involved in the civil rights movement and very much aware of social, economic, and educational inequality and wanted to do something about it. Second, the first year budget for this was a staggering $8+ million ($54 in today's money), for an upstart, educational show aimed at disadvantaged kids. Amazing. Along the way we get tons of memorable clips, in particular from the early years (late 60's and early 70s). I never paid attention to Sesame Street until my kids were 3-5 yrs. In the early 90s. I thought is was terrific then. Bottom line: this documentary is well worth checking out.""Street Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street"" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival to immediate acclaim. It got a select Us theatrical release in the Spring, and just recently started streaming on HBO Max, where I caught it. If you have any interest in Sesame Street, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",True
7,7,Pretty Good,Apple Scruff,n/a,16/08/2025,"They glossed over quite a few people/events, including one of the guys who played Gordon (granted, the second guy wasn't there for long). Such is life with this kind of documentary, I suppose. You show me a talking heads documentary, I'll show you someone's story being left out. It really could/should have been a mini-series.Still, there's some priceless material here, including funny Muppet outtakes and some great interviews, both old and new. The ones with composer Joe Raposo (""Bein' Green"", ""Sing"", ""I'm an Aardvark"", etc.) were my favorites, and the behind the scenes footage of the show's creators was very cool to see.",False
8,n/a,What it was Is Normore,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's unfortunate to observe how Sesame Street has evolved over time. I can still recall when it was an exceptional resource for teaching young children's essential values and ethics. However, presently, it appears to be solely about Elmo and his idyllic world. The show has lost touch with its roots and is now inundated with unrealistic scenarios that do not contribute to children's education. Furthermore, what is the deal with the Muppets now having a race? I thought it was previously established that they didn't have a race. It's regrettable that Sesame Street has transformed into a meaningless spectacle that doesn't genuinely benefit youngsters anymore.",False

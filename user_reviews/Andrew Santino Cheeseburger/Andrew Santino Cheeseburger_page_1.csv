1,7,Not like the Pod...,ryannewman-78356,n/a,15/08/2025,"Massive Santino fan here. Watching this just doesn't make me laugh the way his pods do. Of course stand up is a whole different ballgame than podcasting. Maybe there is a widening between funny podcasters vs funny stand up comics going on. Santino's a funny guy but I realized watching this he's just better off script than on script. That's not a bad thing. It's just a new trend in comedy. Still have huge respect for him. Lots of great jokes here (don't let the offended Trump fans on the thread fool you). It may be a bit watered down for Netflix, but I think I'll be sticking to the podcasts moving forward.",False
2,6,Very okay.,lousammy0,n/a,15/08/2025,"Big fan of him and Bobby; however, This special continues the trend of comedians specials being far worse than their ability to be funny on podcasts. That being said. Of those in the rogan sphere, Santino is a lot closer to someone like Segura in terms of on stage ability and joke writing, whereas theo, Delia, and distefano are closer to schaub. Tbh the only truly good or great specials I've seen in recent years (past 5ish? Are louis C. K., Segura, gillis, Normand, Chapelle, and norm. Granted I will still check in to bad friends and whiskey ginger but I no longer entertain the idea of seeing Santino live.",False
3,7,Good sense of humour.,deloudelouvain,n/a,15/08/2025,"Like I once wrote before it's impossible to please everybody with humour as we all have a different sense of humour but rating this stand-up comedy with the lowest score possible is just ridiculous. It was my first show from Andrew Santino and it turned out to be promising. I will gladly look out for more of his shows. He's not afraid of bashing Biden and Trump, or any other politician, as they are all puppets and incompetent. Cheeseburger has some good jokes, but they're not constant enough to make it exceptionally good. Andrew Santino is a born raconteur, it's obvious he likes to entertain people, but some parts of his show are sometimes a bit long before the jokes come. That's the only negative thing I found about this particular show. I definitely like his sense of humour, maybe a bit borderline to some but not to me as I like it raw and over the top. You have to be allowed of laughing at anything, that's what humour is about, no matter if you offend others or not. You just can't please everyone and that's fine.",False
4,6,"Sadly, he is too scared to speak his mind",muratmihcioglu,n/a,15/08/2025,"The man looks like a cross between Bill Burr and Robin Williams. And it was not a waste of time to watch this special. I particularly enjoyed the ""ocean big, straw float, turtle swim"" bit.That said: I don't think this is a fine example to stand up at all. Not because he doesn't have a sense of humor, but because he is extremely scared of speaking his mind.Though at times (when targeting Biden) he acted like he wouldn't mind backlash from the woke, he most definitely does. That is exactly why he didn't and couldn't target Obama or Kamala.Totally in line with the CRT narrative, he equated Trump with Biden on the basis of ""whiteness"" and literally presented these people's race as ""the root problem"" with them.I wouldn't mind much had I gotten the impression that Andrew Santiago himself DID actually buy the ideas behind rampant woke extremism. But when you read between the lines, you just KNOW his mind is not in peace with that narrative. He even mentions Dave Chappelle, which is tactically a huge mistake. Because he can't dare say ""Hell yeah, Dave is great and spot on!"" All he does with dropping Chappelle's name is some lame attempt at mitigation. Had he not blatantly shown the contrast between Dave and himself, he could hide better the fact that he doesn't have the guts to speak his mind. But he just walked right into it.In what world can the ""only mistake"" by Kamala Harris be ""not getting rid of Biden""? What is it about Kamala that Andrew thinks is different than Biden?""She's Black!""Really?Look, Andrew: If you are smart enough to question the narrative with straws, you gotta be smart enough not to be duped by ""anti-racist racism"". You shied away from saying aything bad about Obama not because you thought he was the ideal president (maybe he was, that's not the issue) but because you pandered to what in your mind was your audience.In an age where people criticize even Bill Burr for not being sincere enough, holding yourself back and trying to walk a straight line will not help you develop.",False
5,8,The best comedic timing in the Game,mkarnazes,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been watching Andrew santino on podcasts for 3 years now, bad friends and his podcast whiskey ginger. If you like him on the podcast you will love this special. He is thought provoking, realistic and the vulgar santino we have all come to love. I feel like stand up comedy is an extension into peoples lives behind the camera and how wr all can relate to particular situstions or thoughts we have thst the comedian vocalizes, he nails that dycotomy. He never lets a joke run dry and hits his delivery on every punch line. I highly recommend the special and his podcadts, hes a creative genius and seems like a dude you could defintely drink whiskey and play some pool with.",False
6,2,"Tired, lazy, unfunny.",mikesliff,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've seen Santino live several times. He's absolutely killed it when I've seen him. This, however... I have no idea what this is. This feels like the pumpkin spice latte of comedy specials. Generic, bland, about as ""basic"" as comedy can get. At not one point does this special ever pick up and grab you. Probably be more effective as background noise while you're doing housework than anything else. I feel like he has reached that level where he has attained some level of success, and now he thinks he doesn't have to try hard anymore. It's very clear in his writing and execution. Unfortunate when comics go this route.",False
7,10,Just What the Mulitverse Ordered!,abih-40449,n/a,15/08/2025,"Funny, funny, funny and some. Let me start off saying my wife and I are huge comedy fans. We have seen a ton of comedians including some of the greats. Carlin, Pryor, Mooney, also Mencia, Murphy, and Raphi May to name a few. I really didn't know what to expect and being a fan one cold morning I took the plunge. Love him really loved his style, honesty, timing was off the hook and more importantly Mr. Santino was fearless with a wit to match. Political, current, against the grain and soul searching his show had it all in a time when a older generation but very small minority of people want to censor free speech. This guy like Bill Burr is here to stay. Loved it and I highly recommend watching his show.",False
8,3,Just Not Particularly Funny,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am not very familiar with Andrew Santino, or his work. He appears to be a charming, decent guy. The issue is that he is just not that funny. It is not that he is offensive, or too esoteric. He covers a variety of topics, from the pandemic to sexuality to growing up in the 80's. His delivery is natural. His jokes and storytelling might be ok if he was a friend of yours, but not enough to conquer a Live audience. One of the other issues with the special is that he is also the Director and it is not shot very well. The special keeps going back and forth between two camera angles and it it a little distracting. I like Netflix comedy and try them all. This was very average, at best.",False
9,10,"Hilarious, some odd reviews on here",joeprevite-61789,n/a,15/08/2025,"Never seen his standup before. Love his podcast and his performance on Dave.His timing, story telling, and ability to paint a picture, are top notch. Thought this was funny from start to finish. As funny as he usually is.Some of these review are calling this ""leftist"" or in support of ""cancel culture"". Someone was upset that he made a joke about Trump being killed. The special also contains a joke about Kamala killing Biden by pushing him down the stairs.Do you guys have ears? Everyone has an agenda and goes into watching these things by putting YOUR beliefs and values at the forefront. You only see and hear what YOU want to hear. Just stop it already. It's sad, and annoying. If ANYTHING offends you, you need to quit comedy.This is FAR from ""leftist"" or ""liberal"" comedy. It's just comedy, and it's good. Go into like a normal human being and just watch it for what it is. Something to make you laugh. That's all he is trying to do. He's not pushing some agenda. We need to stop projecting. Please. He even talks about it in this special. You are too worried about everyone else's business. And of course you guys are entitled to your opinions, but not when you are ignoring the full picture. He made fun of anyone and everything. Which is GOOD.Just shut up and watch some good comedy and laugh, which is exactly what this is. Comedy should be sacred. It's art. Let it stay that way. This country is trying to destroy it.",False
10,1,Absolute Trash,mikedough-86695,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was absolutely terrible, what a snooze fest, I fell asleep halfway through it and had to finish the next day it was so boring. There wasnt a single joke that made me laugh. I can't think of one original bit, everything Santino said in this special has already been said in a funnier way by a previous comic. Covid, Prostate exam, global warming etc.... All of it was HACK. If you found this good, I am extremely jealous as you've obviously never seen good comedy and have a lot left to discover. This is on par with Whitney Cummings and Brendan Schaubs latest specials. If I were Santino I would stick to reading ads and doing podcasts.",False
11,8,Loved It - Watch To The End,genious-35413,n/a,15/08/2025,"Cheeto Santino has created not just one of the greatest closing bits ever but what I think of in the same way I do of Gary Gulman's bit about the documentary he watched about the people that shortened the State's names - and has a great similarity.Ignore the review that does the tired, cliche copout of 'What happened to Andrew Santino?' routine. There's always someone that feels the need to dole out a 1-star review just for the sake of being that way. They are humorless and should stick to the reality show they review and like.The entire special is very funny and is on the level that Santino always gives but once he begins talking about his dog, then the ride gets VERY fun and he makes a really great point, which he alluded to earlier.",False
12,1,Disappointing to say the least,stevenseay,n/a,15/08/2025,"Have always been a casual fan of Andrew and used to listen to his podcast fairly regularly (Bad Friends). Haven't really followed him much the past year or so but figured I'd give his special a try after a few rips. About 50% of the way through and I'm honestly not sure what happened to him either before or during the writing process, was he hit in the head by a crazy homeless person? Did he switch bodies with Amy Schumer only while writing jokes? Did someone force him to tell unfunny bits for the first half and save the actual comedy for the second? SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY IT'S SO BAD. Best of luck Andrew, great to see you atleast still have a semi-successful podcast.",False
13,10,I loved it,GuteLord,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed Andrew's special and particularly loved the message behind it. Cheeseburger might not be for everyone, but you can probably say that about any special. Those who are fans of Whiskey Ginger or Bad Friends will especially love this special. He covers a barrier of topics, all of which I thought he was able to convey in a very funny way that kept me hooked in throughout the hour long special.As someone who falls in the middle when it comes to politics, you can say Santino's bits about politics matched my palette perfectly. For those who are far on the right or left, you might not enjoy some parts of this special.",False
14,1,Political bull - only for Dems,phojar,n/a,15/08/2025,"The very first line out of this ""comics"" mouth was about the anti Vaxers. Immediately no. I've seen what I needed to see, immediately no.We tried to watch for the first 5 minutes and not a single laugh. Listen, you want to immediately turn off at least half your audience - get political. I'm not giving this leftist another second of my time.We made it through the hospital bit about someone getting a vibrate silver bullet stuck in their butt and going to the ER. He literally said he would kill hisself and imitated the motions. Really??I would suggest passing on this due to lack of laughs and political topics.",False
15,1,This was bad. Really bad.,bizzyziggy,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI really think the current crop of so-called stage comedians need to go re-watch some of the greats from the 70's and 80's. The material used now by so many, just goes for the gross out factor. It's no longer a shock and something new, and is mostly just in bad taste. It seems like so many, including Andrew, are just doing whatever they can that will get them cast in that movie, or maybe even TV series role. Bad writing. Bad timing. Bad material. The only thing I can give him credit for is, he actually commented about the current administration. I haven't seen any of the others have the balls to do that. Though, he had to play it safe and counter it with TDS, red-man bad, with the usual media induced lies.",True
16,9,Haters... 8.5,yourmyboyduke,n/a,15/08/2025,"First off this was a great special lots of laughs. I think people that give this anything below a 6 either didn't watch the whole special or just can't handle comedy.This special has tons of great stories, he rips into both political sides, talks about his upbringing and finishes with a creative joke that I think he did exactly 💯💯💯First off this was a great special lots of laughs.

17,1,I want my time back,crash-03449,n/a,15/08/2025,Not only is he not funny but he is literally advocating for the murdering of a US president. I don't care which side of the aisle you are on that was completely not funny. It seems even the audience was forced to play along with his horrible jokes. I used the term jokes but they really weren't even that. The best way to sum it up is that I want my time back. This review thing is literally making me write 240 more characters so I guess I'm just going to Babylon until the time is on. Now I'm down to 126 118 106 9894 I don't know how long this will have to go before it'll be done. I'm almost there now it'll finally let me submit.,False
18,8,This man can do anything!,trey-81155,n/a,15/08/2025,He is able to walk a very fine line that we haven't seen since early early stages of David Chapel.The people hating on this are looking for John Milany joke after joke but Cheeto he builds and makes you see what he's seeing.Hard to get.When you understand that comedy is such a wide spectrum from story telling to punchlines to timing you understand this is legit an art form.He is able to walk a very fine line that we haven't seen since early early stages of David Chapel.The people hating on this are looking for John Milany joke after joke but Cheeto he builds and makes you see what he's seeing.Hard to get.When you understand that comedy is such a wide spectrum from story telling to punchlines to timing you understand this is legit an art form.,False
19,1,Didn't laugh once,OnlySethDavis,n/a,15/08/2025,"This guy thinks he is hilarious and edgy but he is anything but. What a mess from start to finish. I watched with two of my friends... one of which watches his podcast with Bobby Lee on YouTube. Even He was visibly cringing throughout. This guy just isn't funny. He wants to be. He thinks he is. He's not. It was sad to watch and the only redeeming factor was that we got a good laugh at his expense by roasting how awkward and strange this man is. If you want to watch it, watch it... but don't be surprised if you are left feeling sorry for the guy. Why do so many comedians these days take themselves so seriously??? It's like they think they are the only people on the planet capable of being funny. Off-putting and odd. I didn't enjoy any of his ""comedy"" and he seemed very afraid of getting canceled which was a little cringeworthy but honestly funny because I don't think he could even be canceled, considering nobody knows who he is. Just outright weird.",False
20,1,Killing Obama?,rehconcepts,n/a,15/08/2025,"This guy is a viewers nightmare as he is lazy and delivers his audience a clamshell full of cancel cultlure let me fit it with the woke crowd to be accepted antics - complete leftists nonsense wrapped up as comedy.....in one of his ""observations"" he advocates for killing a president - If you simply replace the word Trump with Obama would this have caused any sort of outrage in the media on advocating to kill a president? Does that really pass as a joke? I really feel that we no longer have comedians they only want to be accepted by what they perceive as the in the crowd - do yourself a favor skip this and go back in time to find actual stand up comedy.",False
21,5,A mediocre comedy set told in two parts...,Airman87,n/a,15/08/2025,"This whole special feels like Santino was angry and drunk when he wrote it. Cheeseburger really is a comedy set that is divided into two parts. The first half is hyper focused on politics. It's fatal flaw is Santino can't help but parade his West Coast elite mentality around. As a comedian he should know how badly this alienates half his audience. The second half of the set detours slightly and becomes way too preachy, focusing more on Santino's personal views while being thin on jokes. There is one massive five minute setup for a single joke to land come the end. As someone who occasionally watches highlights of the Bad Friends podcast with Santino and Bobby Lee, I was expecting more out of Santino than this...",False
22,5,You need to really be open minded...,ItalianHunk21,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHear me out. Jokes are meant to be controversial and go overboard sometimes, but I also feel that the comedian needs to be able to paint a picture and show you from their view points why they are viewing things a certain way. If your views are one sided to begin with, it's going to be difficult for some people to relate. I was trying to stay neutral but this special leaned hard left. And I get it, we need to all be able to laugh at each other, from both sides. I guess it's my fault since I expected a little more since I have seen his podcasts on the internet and usually like his work. I just couldn't see the humor in this. Don't see how someone is rating this an 8-10, and then complaining when someone is rating it low? If it's funny to you, it's funny to you.Spoilers:
Starts off making fun of Anti-vaxxers. Okay, we're still on this subject? Goes on to say how he got the shots and boosters, and brags that who cares if you don't know what's in it? Even said that's the fun part of it. (Makes a reference of doing drugs in high school and not knowing what was in them) After all that, he then goes on to thank the medical professionals, but then immediately criticized them saying he doesn't trust them (thinking he was gonna say how they lied or something about the shots), because he got a bad prostate exam. Wait what? (Hold on... it might get funny now.) He talks about how he had a bad experience? He got a finger in his ass and the doctor left abruptly. What was he suppose to do, cuddle you afterwards?",True
23,5,Would've given it a higher rating if the material was more fresh.,tonypiece,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAndrew Santino is a really funny guy, but good god, he still has like a 15 minute bit on Trump. How are comedians still trying to get Trump laughs? Hit the crowd with some Millard Fillmore material while you're at it, bud. I didn't like the guy as our President, but his time has been over and the new catastrophe in the White House offers such fresh material on a near daily basis. The beginning was really funny, but he lost me at the political stuff because it just felt like the same recycled material that every single comedian has been using over the past 6 years. At that point in the routine it felt like it could have been any comedian on stage telling the jokes that Andrew was telling. Someone wake me when the political bit is over.",True
24,2,Disingenuous,slcapp,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm trying really hard to remember a part of this special that stood out. All that's coming to mind is this guy over sharing his sexual kink. He's lost touch with the most important part of a joke; is it funny? I recently watched a video explaining how comedians in the Rogan sphere just aren't that talented. Some have what it takes to stand out on their own; this guy isn't one of them. It's unoriginal, it's provocative but not in a smart way, it's egotistical, and it's disingenuous. He misinterpreted the whole be yourself and people will love you thing. Be yourself, but fine tune and craft your perspective so we can all see the humour you see. Oversharing you play with your own a** to c*m and then telling a joke about being scared to have a prostrate exam. I'm just not buying it. I'm not buying this is who you are. Stop being whatever you think people want you to be. Just be you and do it with genuine confidence. Be unbothered whether we get it or not because you know it's funny. Kill the ego.",True
25,2,Andrew what was this?,ahoffyman,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love Andrew on Bad Friends and I know he's a funny guy, but this was just awful. I did not laugh once. I've seen comedy live a few times and I know it's always better in person but this was an absolute snooze fest. This was the most sterile, middle of the road, ""I have all the right opinions but I can sort of, kind of, maybe see the other side...right? Guys....right?"". If this is what comedy has become I am very sad about it. I've loved standup comedy my entire life but this just put a bad taste in my mouth like I was watching Disney destroy Star Wars all over again. Santino you're better than this. What was this material. Even the audience barely laughed. Props for not adding in fake laughter I suppose but the reality is there were so few punchlines or jokes that it really wouldn't have made a difference.Yes I know this isn't a professional review but this just ruined my night.",False

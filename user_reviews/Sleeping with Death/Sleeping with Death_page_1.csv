1,7,just...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"About fairly average true crime tv series, builded up around dramatizations, loads of still pictures of victims and close ones, heavily saturated with interviews by police and attorny staff members, and to some extent the people who has lost their loved ones, and just a little bit of press and media clips.What really lacks for the very interested true crime viewers is the 911 call, the true live interviews done upon suspects and culpritsalso its competely lacking police onscene camera/bodycam nor still pictures of the actual crime scenes in this series that contains quite some horrific and weird true crime stories, so a seven is at max from the grumpy old man. Its not boring at all its just flat.And oxygen must please stop unveiling the story before each commercial window, its like driving over a police stickrope that spoils ''the fun'' of a good night true crime binging.",False

1,10,Gets a 10 cuz it's a subject that it's crucial for the public to know,seasideroses333,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been familiar with Cathy O'brien's story for many years, hearing about it from different sources, mostly from those that are valiantly exposing the horror of mind control and how far its tentacles reach. She is one of the few known successful cases of getting free of it, and she is telling her story. I appreciated that her movie is only $12 to buy; it would be a public service to get it and show it to everyone you can. I just listened to an interview with her and the documentary producer, Adrienne Youngblood. It was very informative (on rumble), and can help prepare one to see the documentary. She comes across as sane, rational, and believable, and her advice on how to get free of mind control is simple but profound. So, though I haven't seen this yet, I believe I can heartily recommend it to all that want to find out what our government as well as evil globalists/satanists have been doing to the public for many years.",False
2,10,Everyone and I mean EVERYONE must see this film,max-holm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was not aware of Cathy O'Brien or MKUltra. This film is not exploitive of the topic, but opens your eyes about the powerful people who have been and are involved in these atrocities. The methods used by MKUltra are currently being used on the entire world population. Please watch this film and tell everyone to watch it, as well. We must wake up before it's too late.",False
3,10,Reality is Glimsed In Rare Expose' by the Last of Very Few Survivors,frankietease,n/a,16/08/2025,"As I watched this documentary in Jan. 2024, I began crying as Cathy revealed truths I know I have been exposed to growing up in California in mid 60's as a kid.How did I not hear of this in 2022?Cathy is literally talking to millions of cult kids who are dealing with this type of mind and body trauma on smaller or mass scale. She even mentions that this type of thing is used in religion to keep people devoted and enslaved. Free labor.Thank You to both Mark Phillips (RIP) and Cathy O'Brien who dare to tell these facts.One experiencing them, one having been the scientist involved in the technology. This vantage point makes the credibility as solid as a rock. People don't want to talk about any type of mind control, as conditioned, ""that's scary, boogy man and tin foil hat"". Esp. In UK and U. S.Rip the scab off, because it's high time truth be told. Aptly for an election year, this year, we see that both red and blue are highly controlled by unseen cash and ideas, as well as brutal human trafficking and mental slavery which is hard to prove.Our human race has been commodified quite some time ago?By whom?Watch the doc.It aint perty.I am starting to cover this in detail on my podcast throughout 2024, search Frankie Files Podcast.Though I had seen pictures of Cathy O'Brien saying she was a mind control victim of MK Ultra, I didn't think it had anything to do with me, cults, or society at large. She's right here, trying to help us.The methodical telling of this sequence of facts by the calm and powerful voice of Cathy O' Brien is incredibly effective. I admire that the directors / producers didn't just show a bunch of stock photos of mental wards to represent scary mental stuff. It's not all like that anyway. It can look as ordinary as pie.I'm heading off to read Cathy's three books. It's clear to me that there is major work ahead of us to spread this woman's story. I'd venture to say that algorithms aren't pushing it for her.Thanks again Cathy, from a cult kid survivor who didn't know.",False

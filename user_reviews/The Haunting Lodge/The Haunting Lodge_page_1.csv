1,5,Interesting enough for what it is but not much more than that,kannibalcorpsegrinder,n/a,16/08/2025,"Asked to visit a hunting lodge, a pair of paranormal researchers arrive at the location and proceed to their tactics of looking for the paranormal, soon sending themselves on a dangerous quest with a bring they never expected to encounter.This wasn't too bad for what it is. The core concept of this one focusing on the backstory of the location as the various sightings and experiences work perfectly to set up the location for the investigation that takes place. Filled with the typical kind of interactions and experiences taking place with their cameras and equipment, it all leads to somewhat more chilling and energetic encounters made all the better with the panicked found-footage format that allows this to get pretty close and personal to the hauntings. However, that doesn't change the fact that this one is severely dull for the vast majority of its running time. While the build-up of these events isn't so bad, there's still a lot of the film amounting to nothing more than people reacting to strange beeps or noises from their devices rather than featuring anything that genuinely showcases proof of the supernatural that they're seeking. The need to feature all the useless interviews on the town's history does this no favors and it all comes together into a cheap, somewhat bland experience.Rated Unrated/R: Language and Mild Violence.",False
2,3,Another Pathetic Attempt,jkakos,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYes, another pathetic attempt to prove hauntings are real. They are attempting to make certain sounds and events paranormal when they are not.And the pathetic psychic that comes to the house even suggesting animals when killed without respect, somehow threaten you in the afterlife (the boar).It's so obvious they're trying to make you believe these events they're investigating are real and proving activity in the afterlife. I don't know how many times I hear the phrase, ""Oh my God. Did you hear that?"" ""Did you see that?""They are trying too hard to make us believe and that's why it's authentic crap.",True
3,2,Big letdown,hammybarca,n/a,16/08/2025,"Went into this expecting it to be a full on found-footage horror movie. Started off slow, but that's was okay because lost of found footage films start off slow. But got 2/3 of the way through, and there had yet to be anything scary at all. The last 1/3 was the most disappointing. So much opportunity to do something scary. Even if it was something completely out of left field. But no, it was honestly just so disappointing. I've seen bad movies before and still enjoyed them for the few good things they have in them. But this movie (which is just over an hour) had basically nothing good about it.",False
4,2,What was this?,nickmarcantonio,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have to say, this was a documentary that makes an attempt to be scary. All the elements are there, except one: the scare. We have a team of paranormal investigators, with a psychic, who are investigating the strange occurrences at a lodge. While the team and evidently the psychic, see scary and frightening things, we the viewer do not. There is nothing scary about a light or a door opening on its own, as these things can be done easily. We see frightened and astonished looks ok the faces of the cast, but we are treated to nothing ourselves. The only horror element to this movie are the drawings and sketches made by the psychic, of the so called ""ones"".If you are looking for horror, do yourself a favor and give this one a pass. Even removing the ""horror"" element, as a stand alone documentary it's utterly boring and eventless.",True
5,2,I hoped it was fiction,spiritcloud,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have to confess: I came across this movie randomly, and I honestly thought throughout the entire thing that it was just bad fiction. Realizing it's supposed to be an actual investigative documentary makes it worse somehow. Like instead of it being bad acting, it's bad acting trying to come off as not acting. I think the line ""ghosts don't have that heavy of boots"" says it all. Especially given the alleged nature of the entities.Even the title is misleading, which there should be no reason for with a documentary. They couldn't seem to make up their minds if these were physical beings that couldn't be seen and had to use doors, or balls of energy that teleported around and through things without effort.But hey, if you want to believe advanced aliens traveled all the way to earth (from Orion?) (to hunt?) and had spent years trying desperately to get help from random hunters staying at a lodge...but also definitely didn't want said hunters to be there...and kept sneaking into their rooms...but were also afraid to get near them-no, actually I can't even think of a valid reason to justify believing illogical nonsense.I would say there's a very strong case for the high reviews on this film being fake/paid for. I've seen more than enough freelance projects listed for such things.",True
6,n/a,Utter Nonsense and BS,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Does anyone actually believe that this nonsense is real? I put this on in the background for some noise while doing housework and that's about all it was good for. I imagine the ""crew"" of this ""documentary"" are a bunch of out of work film school dropouts trying to justify/recoup the cost of their equipment. ""Ghosts don't have such heavy footsteps."" Seriously? You can buy a variety of ""paranormal equipment"" online and start your own ghostbusting investigation team. These shows are ridiculous and I'm glad I only turn them on occasionally for background noise and to see just how silly they can be.",False
7,9,A haunting with answers.,jbdegriz,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Haunting Lodge was entertaining and informative, a truly enjoyable film. The program had first person interviews along with the details behind the investigation. The show provided several examples of what was being experienced and showed how the investigators worked to verify what was happening. I liked that some of the events were recorded for the viewer, not reenacted. While the primary crew did great work, they also brought in additional resources to get to the bottom of things. They certainly connected some dots for me. If you want to watch a show that provides some answers you need to check this one out.",False
8,1,Dull and predictable,jamesgordonemail,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a movie bereft of any tension, scares or anything really interesting. Obvious the 10/10 reviews have been paid for or are from the cast and crew.The film just becomes laughable as soon as the ""Psychic"" shows up. She has great revelations that a hunting lodge is connected to guns and black boars.From that point on, its even worse acting and b.s.Not one reason is given for why the ""entities"" would be interested in a lodge in the middle of nowhere.All in all, avoid. There's just nothing here to overcome the dullness and lack of tension. There are far better haunting or contact films out there that are worth your time.",True
9,9,Well done,tkmm-43379,n/a,16/08/2025,"In The Haunting Lodge, a group of filmmakers unwittingly selects a seemingly ordinary lodge for their stay, only to be plunged into a nightmarish world of supernatural terror. The film excels in creating an atmosphere of suspense and dread through clever cinematography and chilling sound design, transforming every creak and whisper into a source of genuine horror. As the characters delve deeper into the lodge's mysteries, the film explores themes of fear, belief, and the fragile nature of sanity, all without resorting to gratuitous gore. With a talented cast delivering convincing performances, ""The Haunting Lodge"" stands out as a memorable addition to the horror genre, offering a chilling and thought-provoking cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.",False
10,10,Absolutely phenomenal!,ryanseymore,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I say that this documentary has me absolutely speechless, it still doesn't do it justice! From the history, first hand interviews, evidence to back the claims, and an absolutely emotional roller-coaster of surprises. If you care as much about the paranormal as we do,
Do yourself a favor, check! This! Out! It's shockingly cinematic, suspenseful, energetic, and full of informative scenes that keep you wanting more!If you have not considered watching this film yet, you are truly missing out on (in my opinion) the best paranormal documentary this year! Kudos to everybody that was involved in the making of this film and I look forward to an update on this location in the future!Absolutely speechless. üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè",False
11,10,Utterly Fascinating,adaminpac,n/a,16/08/2025,"The haunting lodge was a remarkable documentary chronicling the high strangeness of a remote hunting cabin. Otherworldly. Fascinating. Melding various interconnected phenomenon into one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Watched it multiple times because my mind was blown! From the team behind the house in between and sleepless unrest, the real conjuring house this is definitly on a whole other level. Every documentary has been insanely good and I highly recommend it to any enthusiast of high strangeness. Looking forward to future adventures especially in a saturated genre this definitly stands above the rest.",False
12,10,Amazing!,soniastedt,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie was not just captivating from start to finish but has a certain authenticity that is so rare to see in film these days. My eyes have opened in many ways after watching this and has left me very curious to learn more about this subject. Its crazy to think places like this exist but ive heard many stories that support this. Im so hoping there is a sequel to this!!! So cool to see it captured on film! Im not sure I would have it in me to spend the night at a place like that. It seems like the people in this film have a lot of experience in situations like that. Please make a sequel!!!!,False
13,8,Another step toward understanding,sheryl-69644,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed this a lot-the stuff captured on film kind of did me in! The encounters in the field at night were shocking but somehow a bit of ""a-HA""! People looking for jump scares and horror trope stuff should look elsewhere for that. This seems to be legitimate investigation with amazing results. My only complaint is that it's too short-I really became invested in the history of the house and the surrounding land. Maybe this will be a part of explaining a whole host of questions humanity wrestles with-Where are we going, what happens to us when we die, and who else is out there. I'm trying not to spoil it without sounding vague, but that's how a lot of this stuff presents- vague.",False
14,9,It's a watch from me,cynvanity,n/a,16/08/2025,"Haunting Lodge is a thrilling cinematic experience that expertly blends psychological horror with supernatural elements. As a group of filmmakers venture into the eerie confines of a haunted lodge, they are soon plunged into a nightmarish world of unexplained phenomena. The film's ability to craft a palpable atmosphere of fear and uncertainty is one of its standout features, keeping the audience on edge from start to finish. While it does incorporate some familiar horror tropes, Haunting Lodge intelligently subverts expectations at key moments, leaving viewers guessing about the true nature of the otherworldly entities haunting the lodge. With convincing performances and a well-paced plot filled with unexpected twists, this film is a must-see for anyone seeking an adrenaline-pumping and spine-tingling cinematic experience.What sets Haunting Lodge apart is its unique portrayal of the lodge itself as a character shrouded in dark history and sinister secrets. This added layer of depth enhances the overall sense of dread and fascination with the story. The chemistry among the cast members adds authenticity to their characters' fear and desperation, drawing the audience deeper into the unsettling world of the lodge. Ultimately, ""Haunting Lodge"" stands as a well-crafted thriller that delivers on its promise of suspense and supernatural intrigue, making it a standout choice for fans of the genre and a compelling addition to the world of cinematic horror.",False
15,10,Great documentary!,rebeccafpittman,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Haunting Lodge is so well done. There are more paranormal captures than I've seen elsewhere. This plays like a doc/movie due to the music soundtrack and great editing. It's a great blend of history and spooky chills. Kendall and Vera have a refreshing ring of authenticity compared to the over-the-top theatrics of so many films in this genre.When you have the historic background, the paranormal activity has so much more relevance. They interview local historians and owners giving the film a feeling of substance and direction. The captures are audible to the viewer instead of muffled recordings you can't make out where you have to rely on the investigators' word. I highly recommend it!",False
16,8,Insteresting if you like Ghost paranormal stuff,TheBigHammer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kendall and Vera are the main characters of this documentary that move into the lodge to begin their paranormal investigation. Vera is the first to experience some paranormal activity, but soon they both experience terrifying stuff (good thing it's all on camera :)), including being touched while they sleep (Just the thought of this creeps me out). This leads to them calling a psychic medium Jill Morris, to talk to the dead and to help them solve the case. She then proceeds to tell them that the haunting is the work of an intelligent entity (I'm still confused, but I'm not the smartest tool in the shed). The insidious creepy secrets of the hotel are revealed as the paranormal activity escalates. The couple find themselves in over their heads which leads to this wonderful documentary. If you like ghost hunter stories you'll enjoy this. Good job to the team behind it.",False
17,10,The next step of understanding,tonyapatel,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a must watch for paranormies to further develop their understanding of how this field is always evolving. Bringing in a psychic medium on an investigation like this is to corroborate in real time what the science is showing us is another step in understanding how the physical, metaphysical and paranormal world are all connected. The more we explore the unknown, the more we find out about how entities interact with us, and it pushes us to create new equipment to help us see what is unknown. The lights experiment done outside with the medium is extraordinary. Then to see what the medium saw is and what she explains is really incredible.",True
18,8,Cool Found Footage Indie,jcairns-468-29228,n/a,16/08/2025,"Enjoyable found footage horror film that stays light on the ""horror"" but remains compelling in its own way. First off, ALL the actors felt very authentic and in-the-moment for the entirety of the film. I especially liked the main duo who, although being charmingly annoying at times, had great screen charisma that kept me watching throughout the entire film. I'd gladly watch another film with this duo if it could happen. Would be great if this was a trilogy or a series.This was also very original in both the location and the type of unknown entities in the film. Also unique in that this film is not really ""hard-boiled"" horror but more like a ""cozy mystery"" horror if that can be a thing.Recommend a watch for some light and easy enjoyment.",False
19,8,Worth The Watch,Wildx,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm always skeptical about paranormal stories. I personally had never heard about this couple, but I have to say this documentary was very well done. Some paranormal documentaries have a tendency to rely on spooky music to build momentum. But any chills you may feel actually comes from the excitement of what you're watching. Definitely worth the watch!!!",False

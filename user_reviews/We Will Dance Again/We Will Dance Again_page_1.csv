Film from Nova party goers to Hamas terrorists, shows the day that should never be forgotten by the civilized world.The survivors who told their stories will remain with me for a long time.

Throughout the entire film all I could do was watch with 100% of my body. I felt every piece of this film. Thank you so much for sharing it with the world.The focus of the film highlighted a few people's stories and shed light to first hand experiences of what went down during the massacre.

5,10,Very powerful first hand perspectives,jonzucker,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile difficult to watch, this movie gives multiple first-hand perspectives of the events from the Nova Peace/Dance/Rave Festival on October 7, 2023.

6,10,When the Music Fades: A Story of Survival and Spirit,psyismylife,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWe Will Dance Again (2024) is a heart-wrenching tribute to resilience in the face of terror. The documentary captures the joy of the Nova Music Festival, shattered by a brutal attack, and weaves together the stories of survivors who recount their moments of horror, courage, and loss. It's a film that grips your heart, reminding us that even in the darkest times, the will to dance, to live, remains strong.What stands out is the rawness of these personal stories. The documentary doesn't sensationalize the trauma but instead offers intimate glimpses into the aftermath of tragedy. You feel the weight of the silence, the broken beats of a festival that will never be the same. Yet, beneath it all, there's an undeniable strength, as survivors refuse to let this moment define their futures.But let's be real-anyone giving this film a bad rating must be heartless, you know who they are.",True
7,10,this is not...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA film that you may say you love or hate, cause it is IT, and IT is a fear that you cant put words on, other than death, hate and and believe it or not love...love for being alive and for being still a free spirit, that can tell the whole world about all the free spirits that faded away at the nova festival in israel october 2023, innocently killed in a way that you wont believe is true, unless you watch this documentary...lots of opinions there are on ''the palestinian problem'', but the way of extent hamas took things this way were far of anyones mind, a massacre upon your neighbour youth that has very few historical comparitions.I cried and bled inside watching and listening to this armagheddonlike bestiality, that became a hamas partypurge that left 1200 dead, and 1000's wounded, and millions that wish for revenge...maybe hamas have lost their partytickets for life after showing that kind of humanity...how wrong could they be?I award this film a 10 star on the imdb meter, its a lot to swallow, and there are still 99.99% of audio and visuall recordings on stock, and how they have subjectively balanced this matter is really worth attention, thinks the grumpy old man.",True
8,10,Tragic event great documentary,JamesCameron7,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe soul, wounded from the beginning, finds it difficult to safely watch the film-despite the fact that there is no significant documentation in it that hasn't already appeared in other editions or on Telegram. On the contrary, the real strength of the documentary lies in the familiarity that developed over two months between the audience and the events depicted: here is Mia dancing even before everything went wrong, here is Ruth Peretz's abandoned wheelchair, and here is someone walking by the cursed avenue of chemical toilets. There are frightening hints that only became apparent in retrospect. ""We are going to Gaza,"" writes one of the young women who attended the party the day before. ""We have a strong army,"" announces another as the alarms sound. Twenty minutes later in the film, when that bathroom avenue turns into a battlefield, someone else exclaims, ""How come there's no army here?""",True
9,10,A necessary documentary to promote truth & understanding in a world filled with lies.,pininakahn,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDocumentary Review: ""We Will Dance Again""""We Will Dance Again"" is a powerful and emotionally charged documentary that chronicles the aftermath of the tragic Nova music festival massacre. Directed with sensitivity and respect, the film offers an intimate portrayal of the survivors, families, and communities left shattered by the sudden act of violence during what was meant to be a celebration of life, music, and unity.The documentary opens with footage of the festival in full swing, its energy palpable as thousands of young people revel in a shared love for music and culture. This serene introduction is juxtaposed with the horrific events that follow, plunging the viewer into the chaos and terror that unfolded on that fateful day. Rather than sensationalizing the tragedy, ""We Will Dance Again"" focuses on the human stories behind the headlines.Through deeply personal interviews, the survivors recount their experiences with raw emotion, reliving the moments of fear, confusion, and survival. The filmmakers have done a commendable job of giving voice to those affected, allowing them to share not just their trauma but their resilience as well. Interspersed with these narratives are reflections from families who lost loved ones, creating a portrait of grief that feels both specific and universal.One of the most moving aspects of the documentary is its focus on healing. ""We Will Dance Again"" doesn't dwell solely on the pain but also explores the strength of the human spirit in the face of unimaginable adversity. The title itself is a declaration of hope-a promise that despite the horrors of that day, life, music, and joy will ultimately prevail. The documentary shows the survivors and the community slowly rebuilding, whether through memorials, music therapy, or simply coming together to support one another.Visually, the film is striking. The director masterfully contrasts the beauty of the festival's location with the stark reality of the destruction left behind. The cinematography captures both the vibrancy of the festival-goers and the somber emptiness of the site post-massacre, creating a haunting yet hopeful visual journey.Overall, ""We Will Dance Again"" is a poignant and heart-wrenching tribute to the victims and survivors of the Nova massacre. It is a testament to the enduring power of music, community, and the human will to move forward, even in the darkest of times. The documentary serves not only as a memorial but as a reminder that even in the face of tragedy, there is always hope for renewal.",True
10,10,This is a living testimony to what happened and why it should never happen again,yonicohen-08516,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerA very well made documentary.This is not about politics - it's about humanity.This massacre should have never happened.Well edited and contains real time footage that was taken by party goers.This documentary transports you to the time and location in a way that makes you feel like you are there witnessing it all.It also offers hope amidst all of the suffering that was endured and a glimpse of what it is like for the survivors.I definitely recommend this to anyone that would like to know more about what happened on October 7th.May they Rest In Peace.May everyone in the middle East find peace.,True
11,10,A must watch for anyone,talyahel-05525,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is nothing short of extraordinary. It provides a gripping, deeply emotional, and incredibly raw account of the tragic events of October 7, 2023. What makes it particularly unique is the use of footage from both the festival-goers and the terrorists, allowing viewers to see the events from two opposing perspectives. This duality adds a level of complexity and immersion that I've rarely seen in any documentary.Easily one of the most compelling and thought-provoking films I've ever encountered.Despite some necessary blurring, the footage remains incredibly intense and difficult to watch at times. It's not for the faint of heart, but the visceral nature of the material makes it essential viewing for anyone who wants to truly understand the horrors of that day. In a time where the situation in the region (as of September 2024) continues to unfold, this documentary offers an eye-opening and sobering look at the human cost of conflict. It should be required viewing for anyone trying to grasp the magnitude of the ongoing crisis.",True
12,1,How Deep?,ninjalie,n/a,16/08/2025,"For something with so much emotional appeal I thought they would put more thought into the interview questions, camera work and editing. The camera angles are awkward, the way its clipped together makes it seem like they excited to talk about sad things. The production detracts focus from the stories that are meant to be the focal point.The soundtrack is a little bit discordant from the themes being discussed. The EDM soundtrack played over serious moments, leaving me both confused and astonished. I couldnt help but feelthat it cheapened what would have been poignant moments for reflection. I wouldnt watch it again. Overall its shame that it didnt do justice to the stories told.",False
13,10,Very important. A must watch!,tarakan-61803,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerUnimaginable events that take place at the time when it's impossible to believe that such cruelty exists in the world.This is a must see movie. Finally we can all see what happened on October 7th and do not have to rely on the slanted media.A heartbreaking and revelatory documentary, told by those who survived the horrors of the Nova Music Festival in the early morning hours of October 7, 2023, and its impact on their lives.This isn't a political statement but an intimate story of a human tragedy. We're taken through the event in slow and deliberate detail, a strange flatness of an account which only goes to make the whole thing so much more agonizing. The banality, of evil.",True
14,10,Open your eyes,rivkaneufeld,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn a world that justice is determined according to your identity, seeing with your own eyes brings you back to basic decency and concepts of good and bad.Long ago I studied philosophy and Rawls ""Veil of Ignorance"" as a threshold for determining morality. Today's identity politics and extremism, on both sides of the political map, have led us to be blinded by simple facts.Listening to those you do not agree with is always important because no one holds the absolute truth.War is terrible, all innocent casualties are terrible. Ask yourself who is trying to avoid casualties and who is aiming towards them.",True
15,10,Im in tears just from watching the trailer,rngphvrvd,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIts so heartbreaking. You see those innocent people living their best lives and it all changes in a second.Its so hard to belive that with today's tech you can actually see the actual barbaric monsters coming in, they smile! They celebrate this horrific massacre !Unfortunately, this review has no spoilers as thereis no surprises or plot twists here. Its just the very sad story of a terrible terror attack as experienced first-hand.How terrible is it that this was just the breakthrough of a war that still goes on?So many innocent lives destroyed, for what??In memory of Shani Louk, Hersh Goldberg, Shahar Tzemach and 1200 more innocent souls taken on this horrible day.",True
16,10,We will dance again!,davekigel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""We Will Dance Again"" is a profoundly moving documentary that captures the resilience and spirit of humanity in the face of unimaginable tragedy. The filmmakers have done an exceptional job of honoring the victims of the Supernova Music Festival Massacre, which took place on October 7th, 2024. Friendship, love, peace, and freedom drew young hearts from around the globe to Nova's EDM music festival in the South of Israel. But as the sun rose, the fantasy shattered. Rockets sliced through the sky, and the dancing stopped. Confusion morphed into fear as gunfire erupted amidst the chaos.

18,1,"Poor production, lack of balance",svklnw,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have 2 main beefs with this film.First, this feels more like a film for entertainment rather than a documentary trying to expose a truth. The perspective presented is very slanted to one side and does not provide enough context or contrarian perspectives by other actors involved on that day.Second, the production quality of the film was poor in my opinion. The interviews were not professional, the questions posed were basic and boring, and the drug bunnies being interviewed make you question how much you can believe. I was hoping for better candidates.Ultimately, I was looking for a documentary, but what I found was more of a drama.",False
19,10,The most important film of the year,noxela-49329,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt could have happened to you, to your daughter.... The unbelievable story of this terror attack. The price we all, as a society, pay for not stopping terror.You have to watch in order to believe. Trigger alert - it is hard to watch. Leaves you with a sense of heartbreak that lingers long after the credits roll. The film confronts us with the harsh realities of terrorism and forces us to reflect on how fragile our daily lives can be. It dives deep into the personal stories of the victims, offering a perspective that is both intimate and painfully universal.The acting is raw and real, pulling you into the emotional core of each character's experience. As you watch, you can't help but feel the overwhelming weight of their grief, anger, and, ultimately, their strength. ""We Will Dance Again"" doesn't just tell the story of one event-it highlights the resilience of an entire community that refuses to be defeated by fear.The message is clear: we cannot remain passive in the face of terror. This film will leave you questioning how we, as a society, can do more to prevent these tragedies. Watching it is not only an emotional experience but also a call to action.",True
20,1,"Nice try, terrible execution",khalid_t-17530,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this documentary right after I watched the documentaries Israelism and Atrocity Inc. It totally puts the film in a different light.The stories are presented in a dramatic way. Rightly so, because the experience must have been horrifying. The production value is high. Too high. It makes the documentary feel like a tool to manufacture consent around the world, instead of telling the story of the survivors. What I definitely missed is some context guiding the unknowing viewer of the events leading to the attack. I understand that's not the goal of the makers, but now it just feels like there is something missing.In short, nice try, terrible execution.",True

I highly recommend watching this with anyone you know. While it is most definitely not an easy watch, it is an important one.Make sure you have a supportive partner to watch is with and are in the right mindset and place to endure such difficult truths.",True
23,10,Powerful and important film,efratia-438-925795,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is a powerful and important film that provides insight and understanding into the harrowing experience of being in the midst of a brutal terrorist attack.Considering what is shown is only a fraction of the horrible events of that day I can't imagine how horrible and terrifying this experience was to party goers.One moment you're surrounded by friends and loved ones, enjoying music, talking about peace and in another moment you're running for your life in the midst of horrible carnage and human suffering. The atrocities committed by terrorists that day have left a wound that won't easily be healed. A wound you'll never forget.I was moved by the testimonies of survives and my heart aches for what they have heard, seen and endured.Beautiful people, civilians... Young and hopeful. Lives cut short by monsters.This is part of the painful reality of the middle east.Rest in peace beautiful souls and I hope the survivers can find a way to heal.",True
24,1,Missed the mark,Silwadman435-73-8251,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""We Will Dance Again"" tries to tackle heavy themes but ultimately fails to address the underlying issues that matter. The film presents a superficial view of resilience, glossing over the real struggles faced by its character and everyone involved. Instead of offering a meaningful exploration of their experiences, it resorts to tired tropes and predictable plot lines. The dialogue is clunky, and the characters feel more like stereotypes than real people. While it aims for inspiration, it misses the mark entirely, leaving viewers frustrated and yearning for a more honest portrayal of the complexities surrounding the story. Instead it creates a state-approved, polarizing film to demonize an entire group of people. Feels Quickly put together without to sway public opinion rather than being a genuine opportunity for a positive impact.",True
25,10,A Powerful and Haunting Tribute: A Must-See for All,inspectorgadgette,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's a challenging and emotional experience, but one that is absolutely essential. This film serves as a poignant reminder of the devastating consequences of hate and the unbreakable resilience of those who survived against all odds. Despite the numerous negative reviews attempting to discredit its impact, I urge you not to be swayed by their biased opinions.It's telling that many of those negative reviews are accompanied by a rating of 1, a clear indication that their intention is not to provide a genuine critique, but rather to discourage others from witnessing the harsh realities that this film portrays. Don't let their attempts to suppress the truth succeed. Instead, I encourage you to watch the film with an open mind and heart, and form your own opinion.By doing so, you'll not only be paying tribute to the lives that were tragically lost, but also honoring the courage and strength of those who endured unimaginable horrors. This film is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for hope, forgiveness, and survival in the face of unimaginable adversity.So, don't let others dictate what you should or shouldn't see. Watch this powerful film for yourself, and allow its message to resonate deep within your soul. It's a difficult but necessary watch, one that will leave you changed forever.",True

Some documentaries change you really deep.The huge wave comes from the Pacific, falls on the shore and returns back leaving the name of the movie on the black sand. You will see the Earth as it was before people. You will see how the system, the ecosystem works, like it meant to work. You will see the beauty of circle of life.Some scenes are breathtaking! When enormous bears fight for the fish, and all this wet fur and scary teeth are just in front of your eyes... no idea how it was captured. Ot bear paws stepping through the sunny water, or the very first moments of a fish born from the caviar...This ecosystem was in great danger some years ago, and there is also a story of how it was saved and about people who made it. I think they are living buddhas. And the most important thing - this story is positive and inspiring. We and wilderness can help and care for each other if we are both kind and smart.And strong, like the salmon.",True

1,10,masterfully done,Aashna_Bansal,n/a,16/08/2025,"Definitely one of the best things I've watched in the past few months. You might think he's funny, you might also think that he's not. But this is something that will definitely stay with you for a long time. The nuanced jokes, carefully woven political commentary, and the entire set was just phenomenal. Had been waiting for this to come out for weeks and watched it the moment it came out. One of my favourite things about Vir's comedy has always been how all of the things he says come back at the end of the show and end up becoming a beautiful culmination of little inside jokes between him and the audience. Will forever be a fan of him. Wonderfully executed.",False
2,10,Very very intelligent,piyali101,n/a,16/08/2025,I thought it was soooo smart to connect the beginning to the end and to stitch the whole thing together soooo beautifully.Speaks bluntly about almost every topic that people are sometimes even scared to think about.Most people will be hesitant to even touch upon some of the topics even though they are relevant and prevalent.It's refreshing to see/hear him talk without fear about touchy/taboo topics and how he manages to turn them into a really funny joke when you least expect it.Absolutely loved the seriousness and the funniness...thought it was done beautifully across possibly the three biggest cities in the world.,False
3,5,Great conceptualization but not funny enough!!,Vella_Viewer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Vir Das been promoting the show very smartly over the last few weeks and I have been a fan of his work for many years. So the moment this special came out today, it started streaming it.It started on a decent note, with interwoven jokes that featured his signature smart satire and social and political commentary. But as the special progressed, I found the jokes or their context less and less funny. We associate his work with smartly written socio-political commentary, but here the jokes simply don't land!! Even in the wide shots of the audience, multiple times you can sense that large sections of the audience aren't laughing hard or completely into their splits!!Maybe this had to do with the 3-city shoot (which I felt is a novel and great concept in theory) but maybe the constant shift of venue, lighting and even vibe disrupted the flow for us (the Netflix audience).I was rooting for the show and will definitely root for Vir's future content also but I wish this one was funnier and sharper.PS Once an artist sets the bar high for the audience, sometimes its hard to match it consistently in spite of best efforts. His Hindi counterpart, Zakir's last couple of specials on Amazon Prime, also fell quite flat and repetitive in nature.",False
4,10,A classic Vir Das masterpiece.,SpoorthiG-9,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fool Volume- hadn't heard of it until he promoted it like five days before the release, yet I rushed to see it the day it did. Got exactly what I expected- laughed till my stomach hurt, a few loud gasps (with awe at his boldness), goosebumps with certain monologues and spellbound at the editing, lighting and cinematography of the special. Vir Das is not just a brilliant writer but what I love the most about him is how he curates an entire show. From the opening line, the props around him, the lighting, the venue- everything plays a part, a very important part in delivering what is simple one of the best piece of art I've seen (since that last Vir Das special I've watched)",False
5,4,"Super high on production value, laughs compromised",ChiragT-70,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved his previous specials but in this one he's trying to sound too intellectual. Nothing wrong in it, but at core, a comedy special is about laughs, not only your flair. Positives: excellent production value, worthy of it being called a Netflix special, Good stories, great command over the language, brilliant orator. These things have hidden the fact that the quality jokes are missing. Laughter should be at core , rest should be additions, not the other way. Felt like a sanjay leela bhansali movie, but unfortunately with a missing script. Giving 4 stars for the effort, light shifting timings, edits, brilliant cuts, tracking away the other 6 for the arrogance of taking the punch lines for granted. Am a huge stand up fan, but this one's a tad disappointing.",False
6,10,Fool Volume by Vir Das is brilliant!,imdbfan-194463,n/a,16/08/2025,"The way he's pulled off three completely different shows across three continents (New York, London, Delhi) and yet it feels like one coherent narrative? That's master-level writing, editing and performance.The transitions? Seamless. The humour? Sharp as ever. And the themes? Personal, political, global. All tied up without feeling preachy.It's not just stand-up, it's a storytelling masterclass in structure and craft.The shift between cultural contexts while keeping the audience anchored in his world is insane. It's like watching someone write three books at once and finish all of them with the same final sentence.",False
7,10,Relatable with the English üòÅ,Rahul-9634,n/a,16/08/2025,Even after doing it in English he is so relatable with all of us all at once isnt he speak behalf of all us and raise the voice everytime and makes us compelled to think that what is happening here well I was there to witness the magic there was a everything the laugh volumee I mean everything I really want to see him doing the same at ahemdabad stadium the biggest stadium of the world i would say seeing him doing that would feel so so peronsal and achieving heartedly congratulations to all the crew and the people who were involved in it you did it guys and you did it so hard and greatestttttt.,False
8,2,"All Set-Up, No Punchline.",tellingsreehari,n/a,16/08/2025,"Do you also feel bad when an artist tries so hard to build a joke, but it ends up so painfully unfunny that you start feeling more uncomfortable than the artist himself? I'm not sure if moving out of India has done any good to Vir Das's humour. He seems to have completely lost the knack for understanding, evaluating, and judging whether his own ""jokes"" are funny.It has to be one of two things. Either Vir Das is the ultimate fad comedian of the modern era. Or people have genuinely accepted that stand-up comedy doesn't have to be funny anymore.There's so much narration and storytelling in the effort to get to the joke, but the punch never arrives. Surprisingly, Vir Das even threw in a few slurs and swears now and then. Maybe deep down, even he sensed that things got real when the audience simply couldn't laugh.Getting through the show felt like a task, and I was only watching it on OTT. I genuinely feel for the live audience who had to sit there and endure it in person. I can't think of a single joke or analogy from the entire show that actually landed.Ok. So by Fool Volume, if it meant a high level of foolishness, then ironically, it is the audience who are the fools here. I'd rather watch ads on YouTube without skipping than sit through another Vir Das show.",False
9,10,Watch now so your eyes ears and heart are stimulated,RobM-069,n/a,16/08/2025,Vir is an amazing comedian from India. He has been in the game for about two decades. He gained Fame in the United States when he did a late night appearance on Conan roughly 10 years ago. If you love Chappelle you will love Vir. You are not belly laughing the entire time you are enjoying this set. He will stimulate your mind your heart and your eyes. He does something very unique which quite frankly surprised it has not been done before - he lights up the audience. Quite frankly especially in the New York room it shows how diverse is crowd is. A few comedians have done what he did with this special which is quite perfect. Several comedians have recorded their specials in multiple locations. Vir did that with the locations that are near and dear to his heart Mumbai London and the best damn comedy club around the comedy Cellar in the village in New York. Go enjoy it. Don't expect to belly laugh for an hour and a half. Expect to laugh. Expect to have your mind and heart stimulated.,False
10,2,"""For the Fool Volume"" - this was the best of all!",GauriT-61,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a long-time admirer of his work - from his earlier specials to his writing, acting, and stand-up. But For the Fool Volume truly stands out as his best performance to date. I enjoyed every single second of it. It was one of those rare experiences where I laughed wholeheartedly, felt deeply, and didn't want it to end. Everything - the timing, the script, the improvisation, the subtle emotional undertones - was perfect.He's not just a comedian. He's a storyteller, an actor, and a brilliant observer of life. His transitions between humor and raw truth were seamless. The way he brings out human vulnerability with such lightness and grace is unmatched. I admire how he manages to stay deeply authentic while still keeping his audience in splits.His energy, his expressions, the way he connects with the audience - it's pure magic. And his words don't just entertain; they stay with you. They echo in your mind long after the show is over.He's not just India's best - he's one of the best in the world. Someone please save him from nazar (evil eye)! Because what he's doing is beyond art - it's healing through humor. As a fan who has followed his journey closely, this special made me feel so proud and inspired.I've watched all his specials, but For the Fool Volume is something I'll keep returning to. It's funny, moving, honest, and filled with soul. If you haven't watched it yet - you're missing something truly extraordinary.",False
11,10,"Different, delightful - thoroughly Vir Das",imdbfan-944199,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved the switching between locations - and wished the show would go on much longer. It was designed to flow, and flow it did. Felt really bad for the losing his voice bit, of course. Besides that, it was classic Vir Das all the way.Come for the jokes, stay for the desi (and relatable, dammit) humour and commentary, go back still laughing at the Gen Z takes, the Kohinoor diamond, the oat milk cappuccino... I enjoyed it, and I suspect you will too. It's certainly different, and it really worked. Call him global/ Indian/ Delhi/ Bombay/ funny/ unfunny, but he sure makes it work. It's a 10/10 watch.",False
12,10,Amazing experience,kiranlvnya,n/a,16/08/2025,"A masterclass in storytelling and satire.Vir Das delivers brilliance once again in Fool Volume. Blending personal reflection with sharp political and cultural commentary, he manages to be both hilarious and deeply moving. His confidence, timing, and ability to turn vulnerability into power is unmatched. Every joke lands with purpose, and the final act ties it all together beautifully. This isn't just comedy-it's art. Must-watch for anyone who loves clever, fearless stand-up. You can tell this special comes from a place of growth and experience. I gave it a 10 because it deserves nothing less. Vir Das continues to evolve, and this is his best work yet.",False
13,10,"Fantastic, Well Written, His Best Yet",TiaraG-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"I always look forward to watching Vir's specials, his short snippets in reels or his funny tweets is something I religiously follow as i wait for his new show. Seeing him so beautifully narrate three comically complex stories erstwhile making the audience laugh, smile and think is what makes him a master of his art. It is a must watch and i cannot recommend another comedian to make you laugh as well as him.He takes you through a journey, and somehow ties it all together in the end . He uses props, hand gestures,facial expressions, voice modulation and even a little bit of singing. That man does it all for his audience.",False
14,10,"Epic , loved it",ArokiyaS-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"Vir Das's latest Netflix special, ""Fool Volume,"" is a brilliant showcase of his unique comedic style and insightful storytelling. What sets ""Fool Volume"" apart is Vir's ability to blend personal anecdotes with sharp social commentary. His reflections on culture, identity, and the absurdities of life are both relatable and thought-provoking. Each punchline is delivered with impeccable timing, leaving the audience in stitches while also encouraging them to think deeper about the topics he addresses.""Fool Volume"" is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates intelligent comedy. Vir Das proves once again why he is one of the leading voices in stand-up today. This special is not just a performance; it's a joyful celebration of laughter and life, making it a delightful addition to Netflix's comedy lineup. Highly recommended!",False
15,10,A Great show and an even greater Special,mertyltina,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched the show in person and loved it. Getting to watch it as this amazing special was epic. The 3 location concept is actually amazing. His ability to seamlessly blend the 3 was spot on. I could actually tell the difference between the subtle changes he had to do at every location but it all seemed to fit in and make sense in the same special. His ability to pick the right choice of words still remains very powerful. Conveying messages without depressing people is an art Vir, and you aces it. I feel hope when I watch you perform, even when some of the things you talk about are the ugly truths. Kudos to you Vir. I'll look forward to the next :)",False
16,10,Vir das- volume up,shlokakanodia,n/a,16/08/2025,"This standup is hands down the best stand up comedy somebody might have seen till date. It feels personal. At the same time you feel a gush of emotions, you laugh; smile; get emotional and reflect upon yourselves a bit. Amazing work done by Vir Das. üëèüèª
Making the audience shake hands with reality with humour and slapstick.",False
17,10,Funny real but more funny,AkashD-9537,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Funny, real, but more funny."" That's probably the most accurate way to sum up The Fool Volume I by Vir Das. Known for his sharp takes and globe-spanning perspective, Das walks the line between introspective vulnerability and riotous punchlines with the confidence of someone who's seen too much-and turned all of it into jokes.",False
18,10,Just Unbelievable,Prerna-879,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everytime Vir comes with a special he proves why he's at the top. He has a very niche audience who likes thought provoking comedy and this is just that. He has set the bar so high this time that it's unbelievable and unachievable but he'll come again with another banger and he'll break the bar himself.I actually couldn't process what I've watched after it finished, i can't even imagine how overwhelming and magical it must had been for the live audience.I come from 2 Indias and both of them need people like Vir with that much intelligence and art.(and yes we empathize not sympathize)
it was a mind blowing experience!",False
19,10,"Vir mama, lit!",NandiniB-10,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a concept! Just finished watching it and then sent a dm on insta and then came here BCOS it deserves all the steps.The concept, the vibe, the setup. Everything was insane. I loved the evil eye sign detail in the title and how well executed it was, just when you were narrating the nazar thing and the title rolled. Beautiful.Oh and also the lighting ya railings also had the evil eye sign. Wo bhi crazy.You are magic, vir. How you deliver everything and it is always like a full circle moment at the end. It's sooo good.Thank you for taking risks and executing unique concepts. Aise he creative log chahiye duniya mei. You are 10/10.Loved it.This is my first IMDb review and I'm glad that it is for this special.",False
20,10,Vir keeps raising the bar for comedy!,TheSidiot,n/a,16/08/2025,"With Fool Volume, Vir Das sets the bar even higher for Indian and Global comedy. Impeccable storytelling, beautifully directed, full of emotion. This is no less than cinema. Going around the world with this level of a talented team is no joke... that's just what he says on stage.Vir not only crafts jokes, he takes you on a journey. It's like a movie because it has a 3 act structure. And you go through this ebb and flow of emotions as you sit in front of your television, sipping a cup of tea while dipping Parle-G. And, at the end, you have to stand up and clap and cheer. Coz this wasn't just a special, it was Joy. It was happiness. It was........ an orgy!!!Not only is Vir a master in his craft, so is his team. Probably the best designed comedy special I've seen. Beautiful sets with interactive elements makes it a part of his special. That's a mastery in itself.Thank you, Vir... for existing!!!",False
21,10,Vir Mama is lit!,aradhanalal-13821,n/a,16/08/2025,"Vir Das is brilliant.Three shows. Three parts of the world. All diverse. All the same. This master story teller has you thinking about what's important and laughing at those silly little things. Same time. The interplay of light and dark. Epic.Peeps, watch this now! Vir Das is brilliant. Period.",False
22,10,Quality over Quantity,MF212000,n/a,16/08/2025,"A special with this kind of depth, intelligence, and intention feels different. The laughters are not more. But intense. Sharper.Some people say he ""compromised on laughs."" But you don't compromise when you distill. You concentrate. You compress. What you lose in volume, you gain in impact. There is no lack of not enough funny lines to make you laugh, but a mastery in letting one line sit in your chest for hours after.Others say, ""Life is already sad, just make me laugh."" But what better way to reckon with that sadness than through a lens of honesty and humor? This special does not run from the mess of life. It shapes it. It reflects. It relates. And if it does not relate to you? Then try to understand. If you do not understand? Just listen. Don't anticipate, or crave for more laughs. Just listen. If you don't listen? Then yeah, you probably won't laugh.But if you do just listen...yelled happiness will indeed leave your body, and you'll be telling the truth.",False
23,10,Fool Volume indeed.,dhanusharanapurwala,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every joke had three things. 1. undeniable factual information. 2. Premise and 3. A punchline. And all his jokes did have that like he explained himself.He brings everything to a full circle with the light, passport and God and freedom of voice and literally everything. The jokes were intellectual and they made you go ooooohhhhh every 2 seconds and made you laugh ever 5 second after ohhhhhing.",False

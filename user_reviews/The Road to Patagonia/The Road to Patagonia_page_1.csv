1,10,"Stunning filming, inspiring story",ktjps,n/a,15/08/2025,"The best documentary movie I've seen and I would encourage anyone who's looking for some inspiration and a mindset shift on their life to watch this. The whole energy of the movie was so special and has me wanting to plan something similar. Beautiful filming that showed the magic of each place. Incredible waves in wild spots. The music brought everything together with an epic soundtrack from Daniel Norgren.This is how we should all go and see the world - immerse ourselves in the country in the most raw authentic way, with as much care for the culture and community as Matty and Heather showed. I can't wait to watch it again :-)",False
2,9,A reminder of the wonder of the world we live in,scopesclare,n/a,15/08/2025,"Full of stunning footage and sincere emotions, this film is a reminder of the preciousness of planet Earth, the blue planet, the only planet so far discovered that can support complex life.Made me stop and think about doing something more to help save the planet, instead of feeling defeated and apathetic, a state which is easy to fall into considering the state of the world, a world that is being destroyed by the endless greed of one single species.This story is a gentle journey that unfolds with the natural flow of up-and-downs that we all experience. I really enjoyed it. Thank you for making this beautiful film.",False
3,5,An animist philosophy of freedom through and oneness with nature.,filmreviewradical,n/a,15/08/2025,"An Australian documentary which premiered in 2022 and is an account by it's director/editor Matty Hanson (who looks a bit like Prince Harry) of his epic journey from the northern coast of Alaska down the west coast of the Americas all the way to Patagonia on the southern tip of the continent. An uneven but fast paced eco themed documentary which was originally planned by Hannon as an attempt to escape from his soul destroying life in Melbourne into nature, with an excuse to indulge in a lot of surfing on his journey down south. But it turns into much more than that, as he communes with nature, and starts a love affair with a Canadian eco farmer (and surfer) called Heather Hillier he meets en route. Written by Hannon with Mike Balson, and co-photographed and co-narrated by Hannon with Hillier, this documentary is often good to look at, and not short of incident, with Hannon having his motorbike stolen at one point, trading motorbikes for horses, meeting Zapatistas in Mexico, Mapuches in Chile, and taking detours into the Andes and the Amazon. And all the time we have this animist environmental movement philosophy of freedom through (and oneness with) nature, and the defence of a 'nature based culture'.",False

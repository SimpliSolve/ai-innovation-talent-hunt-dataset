1,3,Childish drivel,ejhorne,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved the movie, but everything about this senseless surrounding drama told me that watching the documentary would make me cringe at yet another set of overpaid, air-headed celebrities behaving badly. I should not have watched because it actually turned out to be worse than what I expected. All of the claims seem baseless and definitely mimic the behavior of schoolyard children hurling nonsensical taunts. This whole case is such a waste of precious court resources so two immature adults can try to one up each other.I'm very disappointed in Lively because that's not the way to get creative control. Then to bring in Reynolds and Swift; talk about a mean girl gang (Ryan included).This whole case is just one big BS non-debacle. And this is why I no longer pay to go to the movies.",False
2,n/a,Too simplified and false reporting,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary significantly oversimplified a complex legal situation. It featured interviews with individuals who presented inaccurate information and constructed a flawed timeline of events. Crucially, the documentary omitted key parties and numerous lawsuits, while downplaying serious allegations. For instance, the extortion claim, a central element of the legal proceedings, was barely addressed and dismissed as an exaggeration.The documentary relied heavily on the perspectives of three bloggers, a non-expert attorney, and an inexperienced freelancer. This approach lacked investigative journalism and demonstrated a failure to fact-check. The documentarians presented these viewpoints as definitive, without providing any balanced, or well researched information.It is important to note that there are currently eight complaints filed by six distinct groups of individuals related to this case. The documentary only acknowledged three of these complaints, which shows a significant lack of depth.",False
3,1,Biased,imdbfan-4325679937,n/a,16/08/2025,"Clearly Blake's teams is behind this nonsense. She is going down and a little documentary that is clearly 'team Blake' won't change that lol. Want to see how the public really feels Blake? Turn on your comments and we will tell you. Everything will come out in discovery so we will wait patiently and hear ALL the evidence (not just cherry picked hot points her pr team thinks will sway the public. Also, Perez Hilton? That would have worked 20 years ago but he is no longer relevant. Should have asked the expert Candace Owen's!! Nice try, go back to the drawing board and see what else you can come up with!",False
4,1,Middle school short film,imdbfan-6213549694,n/a,16/08/2025,"No facts and biased. I wouldn't be surprised if a 7 grader made this for a school project on her favorite female celebrity drama they've been apart of. This is what it feels like. Why would someone take time and money (based off what I watched I doubt any real money was put into this, unless it was bought by the star bully protagonist herself) to put this together? This in itself seems like a smear campaign and tactic to sway the public, unfortunately we can read, research, and have critical thinking skills. I wish the director actually took time to read the lawsuit on both ends before putting out such garbage.",False
5,1,Unfair Coverage: The One-Sided Narrative Against Justin Baldoni,Kim-is-vital,n/a,16/08/2025,"This coverage was one-sided and unfairly favored Blake Lively. It only highlighted details that support her claims without looking at the full context. A balanced report should include all the facts, not just selected ones.For a more complete and fair breakdown, check out Candace Owens on YouTube or BeBetter on TikTok. They review both sides and all the evidence, which shows Justin Baldoni is not guilty of what she claims. In fact, it seems like Lively is the one trying to smear him to take control of this film and future projects.Good reporting should present both sides so people can make their own informed opinions.",False
6,1,Clear Blake Lively Bias,imdbfan-6567963625,n/a,16/08/2025,Very very biased. Missing critical information. Clearly Lively's team has their hand in the pot with this one. It's quite pathetic. 0/10. Wouldn't recommend. It seems like her CIA public relations management has been working overtime with this one. Very very biased. Missing critical information.

7,1,Paid for by Blake for your pleasure,tsilimidos,n/a,16/08/2025,"Call it what it is... a High-School drama out of a Gossip girl season. My perception isn't based on what reels and web searches I've made. It's not an algorithm, I've read both sides. She and her team are doing damage control and so is he. After all the facts made public the scale of guilty leans more towards her pushing inaccurate situations. I first became interested when JB released a website showing details that would definitely have not been public had him and his team made them available. Read the messages versus her ""no more"" list. Maybe she should have been cast in ""Mean Girls part Duex""... might have been a better fit. No spoilers here... the actual movie was kinda decent.",False
8,10,Blake looked like a spoiled mean girl,drea2dear,n/a,16/08/2025,"Haha, from what I could see, Baldoni didn't argue with a women by giving in to her direction, even tho his job title was director. Was her job title director and editor? I knew Blake's husband's status was hurting her self-worth. The power couple is actually a pair of spoiled brats that have been in our face for far too long. So glad that my instincts are right about the gold digger and her over played husband. I am sure that Blake took all of the advice she could solicit from her husband and kept his name out of it. Why oh why do we only have about 4 actors in Hollywood? Go buy an island and stay there. Give us a break from your narcissistic musings. I was disappointed at Parker Posey for being a rude too. I had been a fan of hers but after seeing the way she was acting with Blake brings to mind bullies instead of professionals.",False
9,1,Obviously made in favor of Blake.,kevin_peinado,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI went into this hoping it'd be a fair and unbiased reveal of the actual feud and events between Lively and Baldoni. Sadly it was not, this was clearly made in order to sway favor in Lively's direction lots of information that has been revealed on social media was excluded. It was pretty clear that all the ""experts"" were in favor of lively. Terrible documentary and terrible ""reporting"" was done on this waste of a project. I would not be surprised if sometime down the road we find out Reynolds and Livelys team was somehow behind the making of this waste of my time. Also not sure why we're not holding Colleen Hoover more accountable for clearly being on team lively.",True
10,1,Truly disappointing,gen_ten,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great to see Perez and Kjersti they did get the truth out but this is 110% one sided. Absolutely hilarious. It's wild to see the producers walked straight up to the line of truth and still missed it by miles. I have his lawsuit memorized so it was obvious and no shock that their ""experts"" (?) didn't read it. I was dying laughing listening to their impressions of both sides, well one to be honest. The 17 point list had ""no more, no more, no more!"" so it must all true"" was the quote from the blogger from Buzzfeed. Or, could it be that was the name of the charity he donated to? Possibly but now that is up to a jury in 2026. The attorney and buzzfeed chick seem to both agree that the studio will hand editing to the bigger star because it wants to make money and that it's not a crime to do so and who is to say that his edit of the film was even better? Yeah, who is to say? It's not like they had any screenings for test audience's. So, is this Shapiro's way to justify what she did by feeding it to the public she was justified in what she did? Same as how Ryan was justified in all he did because he believed it was true and even if it wasn't it was just his opinion? It could have been better and come clean about what they were trying to do here. Clean up her image and trash his. All anyone wants is authenticity. If you want to be a horrible person just be authentic about it.Save yourself 45 minutes, go check out something Perez or Kjersti posted this week. Will be so much better than this.Unless you want a chuckle at ludicrousness and there's nothing else on. Knock yourself out and get ready for some jokes at inappropriate times. Still isnt worth the wasted time.",False
11,1,Super Biased,nakitam,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary leans on Lively's side and omitted Baldoni's best counter arguments and proof. It shows Lively's strongest arguments and counters with some of Bladoni's weakest arguments to try to appear unbiased. Lively and Reynolds have taken over this movie while Baldoni is the one who purchases the rights to the movie.The documentary did not go over any of the messages where Lively is flirting with Baldoni. He always replied shutting down the flirtation attempts. But yet it focuses on him responding to her text messages at 3AM and highlighted that as him being unprofessional.... Just one example of where they focused on a minuet detail so that Lively would look good, instead of talking about evidence that is more significate, but would support Baldoni.Ultimately it sides with Lively while the trial has not yet begun.",False
12,2,Completely biased!,dlk2677,n/a,16/08/2025,"This ""documentary"" if you can even call it that...more like mocumentary...is so incredibly biased! Another bought and paid for biased review just like the NYT article. You could tell the Buzzfeed editor, the guy from on The Ankler, Dina Doll and Emily Bergh are very biased or just terrified of kaleesi and her dragons.I give this show 2 stars for having Perez Hilton and Kiersti Flaa. However, where is Candace Owens, Zack Peters or Stephanie Tleiji. They have all gone into minute details, sifted and read documents, spoken to multiple people who were on set and those who have worked with both Blake and Justin. They absolutely should have been interviewed if you really wanted to be truly unbiased!I've never been a huge fan of Blake Lively but I have liked a few of the movies she's been in. I had never heard of Justin Baldoni before this movie. I know for a fact Coleen Hoover had a 'morals clause' in her contract with Justin that stated if Baldoni was found guilty she would get her movie rights back. This should be proof to everyone! She's been on camera ADMITTING she wishes she had the rights back bc she would love for Blake to have the movie rights NOT Justin. Further evidence for me personally.... I had been in a DV relationship before my husband and I have been harassed quite a few times in places I've worked (I waitressed and bartended thru college). He would NEVER and I mean NEVER joke about it! Ryan made jokes in his movie (Deadpool v Wolverine) and he made jokes during the SNL skit. I don't believe for a moment any loving husband would ever make light of or joke about their wife/mother of their children being harassed or abused if they honestly believed it happened and was traumatic. That should be a clear sign to everyone her claim is garbage!",False
13,1,Paid for by Blake and Ryan?,J-Kidin,n/a,16/08/2025,"How did such one sided ""reporting"" even get made? Seriously the only way I could see this package of lies propagated, is if someone from team Blake sponsored it. The description says ""evidence supporting both sides"", which quickly becomes obvious that it is all on Blake's side and there is no real evidence, all hearsay and opinions. On the other hand, Justin has put hard evidence out in the public and the proof is there, none of which was included in this sad short, posing as a documentary. There is seriously no actual evidence given by any ""witness"" from Blake's side, they only spout opinions and speculation on rumors and hearsay by Blake. There is such a weak case for her it's no wonder her PR team wanted this made up piece of one sided BS out in the public, hoping some dim-witted viewers would actually believe this fairytale. No one believes it- they just wasted more money trying to prove an imaginary hurt on their side. Cant wait for this little short to look even more ridiculous after Justin wins in 2026!",False
14,2,"Absolute Garbage, don't waste your time",natachiawhite,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had already heard a lot of negative feedback about this before watching it myself, but I still wanted to give it a fair chance and see what all the talk was about. Unfortunately, it turned out to be just as one-sided and misleading as people had warned. The documentary blatantly ignores a significant amount of court documents and publicly available information that has already been filed and reported. It presents a heavily skewed narrative, omitting key facts and developments that are crucial to understanding the full context.It's hard not to come away feeling like this was more of a PR piece than an honest attempt at journalism. The way it's framed suggests a clear bias, and it honestly feels like something that may have been funded or influenced by Blake and Ryan themselves to protect a specific image or storyline.Even more frustrating is how it completely glosses over or outright omits much of what Baldoni has already gone on record to refute. His perspective and the evidence he's provided are barely acknowledged, if at all, making the whole thing feel intentionally selective and manipulative. It's disappointing to see such an important issue treated with this level of disregard for fairness and truth.",False
15,n/a,Thats not a documentary,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was very biased, seemed like they paid everyone to talked nice about Blake. No deep investigation or analyzes made. No opinion from both sides, no credible evidence, no new nothing. They didn't do their homework. You can find out more about the case by yourself. Really weak and boring. Do not recommend.",False

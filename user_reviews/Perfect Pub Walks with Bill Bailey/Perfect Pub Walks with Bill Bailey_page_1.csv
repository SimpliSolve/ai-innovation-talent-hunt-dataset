1,9,a transcendental and jocular ramble,resonsoftware,n/a,16/08/2025,Just watched the first episode with Alan Davies and Bill in the Peat District. The landscapes are utterly delightful and the gentle banter between these old mates is most pleasant. Sure not everyone's cup of tea (and what is?) but I found it a welcome and sublime change of pace from most documentaries.Although there isnt a great deal that is spoken and most of the chatter is just whimsy it has its moments of stirring poignancy as Alan shares details of his traumatic childhood. Bill's soothing manner seems perfectly apt as his mate bears his soul.This is an unscripted documentary and is very relaxing and endearing.,False
2,8,Wonderful trek and Reminiscence,ppriest-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"The proposition that Bill Bailey makes is that walks like these provide an opportunity to talk freely and and reflectively while surrounded by the natural and historical landscape offered. This first walk with Alan Davies was very enjoyable and at turns both humorus and heartfelt. Having seen both of them many times in their acting milieu .It was interesting to see them in a more open and ""unscripted"" setting. I will be sure to look for the further walks of Bill and his selected ramblers. Time to strap on my own boots and consider some hikes I might like to take with a number of ""old"" friends I have not seen in some time. Without drones and production crew.",False
3,8,Bill Bailey at his Finest,destiny_west,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think I'd watch Bill Bailey paint a wall and not get bored. Besides having a fantastic energy/aura about him, his humour is fantastic. I was delighted to see Perfect Pub Walks with Bill Bailey advertised and seeing that the first episode was with Alan Davies beckoned me to watch it even more.It was interesting to learn of their friendship and be open and candid about things on their walk. The fact that the scenery on these walks is breathtaking is just a bonus. This show won't be everyone's cup of tea as it moves at a snail's pace, but I did not want each walk to end. Definitely worth checking out if you love Bill Bailey.",False
4,3,Forced laughter and mediocre rambling meet mental health?,vnmjdcv,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis could have been so much better. I am a massive Bill Bailey fan. His stand up routines are up there with Billy Connolly and Robin Williams.But these TV vehicles are well below the standard I would expect from him. The slow motion shots, the drone footage, the corny background music and the inane conversation with Alan Davies are so contrived that it's embarrassing.Davies has clearly been asked to play some kind of city dwelling urban character who ""doesn't do countryside "". So it's up to our plucky Bill to convert him to the wonders of the Peak District.And when Davies isn't complaining about the weather or the wildlife or the inclines, we are suddenly given a heartfelt story about the abuse he suffered as a child. Ok I get it. All very sad (even the music goes all sloppy) but I'd rather hear about this in a completely different programme.This show tries to straddle two themes; the beauty of the Peaks and men's mental health. They are simply not compatible. Do one or the other, not both.But by far the most annoying part is Alan Davies's wheezy laugh whenever there is the slightest hint of a punchline. It's all so forced. And to be fair, Bill didn't do much better. The anecdotes along the way were just not funny. Because walking in the Peaks is not a foundation for comedy.Just talk about what you see. Give us more history. Or geology. Or nature. Anything, but stop dressing a travelogue up as side splitting entertainment!",True

1,9,Randomly watched and what a show,Bgallo28,n/a,16/08/2025,What a great show. I love how they integrated Rob. I didn't expect to get as emotionally involved as I thought I would. Definitely going to keep watching.,False
2,9,This show has real heart and the story makes you a club supporter,reedychris,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just finished episode 6 and enjoying this show more and more each week. The way they've been unfolding the story, sharing the history and the love from the community. To the touches of Ryan and Rob bringing in the Cinderella touch. Its just heart warming and beautiful. I love feel good sports movies, but this has something real about it that draws you in even more than the ""Remember the Titans"" or ""Coach Carter"" movies did.I'm not even a football fan, I'll watch the world cup but thats about it. But this is making me wanna buy a Wrexham jersey and become a supporter.,............................................... ............",False
3,9,Bendigedig,thedivinewoman,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I was a little girl I loved soccer and loved Wrexham. As time went on my tastes changed and soccer wasn't so important.However, my interest was piqued when it was reported Wrexham AFC was bought by these two guys . However, my concern, on learning they were going to make it into a documentary, was it was going to be of interest to them only for that reason. I'm hoping I'm wrong.So far I have loved this more than expected and I'm rooting for Wrexham again. There's a little too much effing and jeffing for my taste as I would have liked to seen this being suitable for all ages. But, Rob seems very emotionally invested while Ryan does strike me as being a bit more of the business side of things and as a monetary investment for him.Still, the best part its it is not being patronising or mean to the Welsh people, seeing the Welsh language featured so prominently is particularly pleasing. And best of all, it feels real and not staged.I wonder if Ryan and Rob have looked into seeing if they have Welsh links on a personal level. Rob, in particular, as there are many Welsh links in Pennsylvania. Bryn Mawr is a welsh name and many West Walians went over and the towns of Narberth and Haverford(west) are in both Pembrokeshire and Pennsylvania.Anyway, looking forward to the rest of the series.",False
4,10,Awesome ( from a 51 year old lifelong supporter),mpd71,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe I'm a little biased because I live in wrexham (and I'm a season ticket holder) and i live about a mile from the stadium as the crow flies and can see it from my bedroom , but the show is great . 2020 was a strange year for all but when news broke about the takeover and it was all a bit surreal and people genuinely thought that someone taking the piss . However , here we are ....... my biggest fear was that we were going to be made to look like idiots and it would be a bit of a piss take . However, less than 12 months into the takeover is was more than obvious to us fans than these 2 were deadly serious and put their money where their mouth is so to speak and they were doing the things that any football fan would expect or wish for from new chairmen and the documentary was gonna reflect this . The show is brilliant to be fair . Its not all about Ryan and Rob as some might have expected but also about the characters in and around the club.Similar to that feeling when your kid learns to ride a bike, or when they win their first egg and spoon race I was absolutely proud as punch of the way the club was presented to the world . This is a big deal for a club our size in our league. In fact I'd go as far as to say that the publicity of takeover and subsequent documentary would be the envy of pretty much every football club around world. Even if football is not your thing , the story that has been created here is absolutely first class and unlike other sports documentary, it's not a sneaky peek at just the team but it's the whole nine yards . I'm sure the rest of the season/series will have it's ups and downs and I know how it ends in real life but the story coming will amaze everyone I'm sure . We'll done fx well done Rob and Ryan well done wrexham fc . Our time has come.",False
5,10,Something good for a change,surfingnaked1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Didn't know what this was all about but I like rob and Ryan so I thought I'd take a look. Have you seen what's on tv now, scripted reality, stupid tv. I can't even watch most of it. I started watching the science channel for something good. Then I watched this and I saw the heart and soul of so many people, real people and I was hooked. The heart. And the should of all the people was awesome , nothing scripted here. I love the fact hey have to subtitle the welsh people so the Americans can understand them. So far everyone has been upbeat by all the people, REAL PEOPlE!! So wish Ryan and bob the best and I will watch every episode .",False
6,10,Where can I buy Wrexham AFC merch? I just became a fan!,steve-marcus26,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just wow. This series takes you into the lives of everyone involved and makes you actually experience what they go through. This is absolutely incredibly well done and cannot wait to see the team climb higher and higher up the pyramid.Ryan and Rob have done an amazing job building this doc-series and do not let us down. The score is perfect, the special effects are amazing, almost makes you wonder if the scenes were reshot. If you are a Ted Lasso fan, this will blow your mind.If you are an emotion-roller-coaster junkie, I do suggest you wait for the entire season to be released, as the cliffhanger will kill you.Well done boys, now go get 'em!",False
7,10,True grit,wellsywibblywobbly,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a rare show. Interesting, funny, moving, authentic and above all heartfelt. It may surprise people to know this is much less about Reynolds and McElhenney and more about a community, a forgotten part of the UK, local characters and a football (soccer) set-up that is immensely likeable (when compared with the grossed-out British Premier League). That is not to say that Ryan Reynolds' renowned wit doesn't pepper the series, but it's not the main course.This could so easily have been a goofed-up Disney show full of scripted laughs, but it's far from it. Instead we see the Hollywood stars build a genuine empathy and passion that infects an entire town. The real stars are in Wales and they won't have previously have an IMBD back history. You should watch it.",False
8,10,Has all the ingredients needed to be a first class sports documentary!,TurboRay,n/a,16/08/2025,Two episodes in and I'm addicted! This has all ingredients needed to be a first-class sports documentary! You can really tell they have the town/city's best interest at heart and really want Wrexham to be more than a football club in the community! Also loving the Welsh language and highlighting Wrexham as a Welsh club! Da iawn!,False
9,10,Early days but I'm loving it this far,cuzcatleco-36907,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know it's early but I can't stress enough how pleasantly surprised I am at how good this documentary is thus far. The tone of the documentary is set from the very beginning, you all may think that just because the football club is owned by individuals like Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mcelhenney that the documentary will have a silly tone, don't get me wrong it has it's silly moments but they're few and far between. The seriousness of the situation is really driven home by the documentary. I can't wait to see more!",False
10,7,"I wanted to hate it, but it's already almost seminal.",FONYMAHONEY,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. I mean, I was fearing what I think a lot of brits were with this show - the offensively unfunny Ted Lasso, in the real world.How wrong I was.The sheer emotional rawness running through this documentary is harnessed to absolute perfection, managing to tread a seemingly impossible balance between mirth & heartbreak with affectionate aplomb, rather than following the standard type and falling into the territory of ego-driven puff piece.Going into this, I already had a lot of appreciation and affection for the two R's (particularly McElhenney, one of the great comedy talents of the 21st century), but I still expected a car crash. Instead, they've turned out the finest sporting documentary since the first series of Sunderland Til I Die. I just hope they make good on their word, and see this through as a long term project to rejuvenate the oldest football club in Wales.My only bugbear? The subtitles. If Americans can't understand English spoken in its actual native accent? That's their problem, and pandering to that ignorance only further enables the enduring ignorance of American audiences to any outside culture. I already hate it when Britain's finest shows are remade (and dumbed-down) for a US audience, these days seemingly in an almost conveyor belt fashion where our finest exports aren't even broadcast in the US in their original form. This is another very typical example of that problem, and frankly - i'm disappointed. It's distracting, can't Disney provide an option for British audiences to remove the (frankly insulting and frequently inaccurate) subtitles? We don't have subtitles on American shows which dominate UK screens, so why do they need them for ours?But yeah - beyond that, as a piece of work, it's really exceptional. Long may it run, and I mean that in every possible respect. But please ditch the subtitles.",False
11,10,I'm Now Following Wrexham FC!,anonima-93565,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was actually an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. I really enjoyed all 18 episodes.Experiencing the high and lows of the Wrexham football club was quite the journey.My goodness you Wrexham supporters know how to chant! I'm from Australia and aussies can't and have never been able to chant like that!I'm now following Wales in the World Cup also!You have to take your hat's off to the one and only Ryan Reynolds & Rob McElhenney..2 amazing human beings with hearts of gold!I must admit i shed a few tears watching this, i was overwhelmed by some of the scenes, i can't describe them for then this review would contain spoilers.Do yourself a favour, watch this doco and give the Wrexham FC some love!Wrexham! Wrexham! Wrexham! Wrexham!",False
12,7,"I dislike reality TV, but love This !",ozomatfan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm fascinated with the idea of building some thing, and watch it grow into something amazing. Besides the fact that I find both Ryan and Rob hilarious, I thought let's see how this show goes. I've watched every single episode, and have to say this One of the first reality shows that is very humane. It has a level of emotion, humor, and rooting for the underdog that you wish all other reality shows could take a lesson from. I love learning about Wrexham, and its people. I also love learning about us as humans. It'll be interesting to see how they continue the show in the future. Thank you for doing this show.",False
13,3,Enough of the fluff,keithquinn196,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show started off so well, showing all the background of the team from buying the team, the grounds, the organisation, and what decisions were being made to show how Wrexham became the success it has become today but this show is now a shadow of what it is.All we get now is fluff, I want to know about the team and what changes they're making, how they made those decisions, and results. Not how a random person started a portable coffee shop. If it's a documentary about the town, sure that makes sense, but this is about the club... So show the bloody team!Sunderland til I die will continue to be the best if Disney continue to cater towards the fluff watching reality TV crowd. Because who doesn't love out of context one liners which are added in when the person saying it doesn't have the face to the camera...",False
14,10,Made an account just to rate S2: E10 - 10/10. Unreal,wee_amory,n/a,16/08/2025,"Same as title. Moved. Completely. The episode ""Gresford"" from Season 2 of ""Welcome to Wrexham"" was a poignant look into the mining history of the region, specifically focusing on the Gresford Disaster. Utilising archival footage and intimate interviews, the episode offered an emotional and humanising tribute to the miners and their families. Excellent cinematography and sound design added to the episode's authenticity and impact. This wasn't just compelling television; it was a deeply moving social document that captured the resilience and spirit of the Wrexham community. Seriously motivating and beautiful.",False
15,10,Only Ryan Reynolds,HelloBlockbuster,n/a,16/08/2025,"Okay, docuseries are like snoozefests to me-usually. On top of that, my initial impression was this was gonna be a rip off of Ted Lasso, but I gave it a shot. Then, as Ryan and Rob are talking on the field in the first few minutes I'm thinking ""they're not scripted at all, seems like a normal convo"".... ""Oh wait, they're using their real names? I need to google this sh-."" Turns out these two geniuses actually purchased this soccer team in 2021 and decided to document the process from the very beginning without ever meeting one another in person before. Mind blown. So yeah, this isn't some Ted Lasso rip off or a crap docuseries. Sure Rob is cool and funny, but seeing just how the heck Ryan gets into these off-the-wall ventures is what has me intrigued. Aviator Gin, Mint Mobile, a Football Club... talk about diversification. I'm thoroughly enjoying watching this and I'm only 15min in to episode 1! I had to pause and get on here to share so anyone wondering if they should watch it could get their sign from me-THIS IS A MUST WATCH.",False
16,10,I HATE FOOTBALL!,jackspence-19896,n/a,16/08/2025,"But I freaking love this documentary.Genuinely, I dislike football so much, watching a match is like slapping my balls against an electric fence. But I've always loved an underdog story. This show has got me wanting more. I'm so disappointed ecerytime an episode ends cos it means I have to wait another week to see the next one. I love the feels and the heart of the people that are so invested in this endeavour that I've become invested. I haven't even Googled anything about the the team which is unusual for me. There is so much heart in these people and so much love for the game that I'm starting to understand them. I'll never like football. But I will always appreciate a good story.",False
17,10,Even if you don't like sports... you'll root for Wrexham!,blondelobster17,n/a,16/08/2025,"I came for Ryan and Rob. I stayed for the town, their love of their team and their undying support. A well made show with plenty of fun, touching moments regardless of your interest or knowledge of the game.Rob is a real standout. I haven't seen Sunny in Philadelphia, but plan to watch now. Rob is extremely likable. Up against Ryan that's saying something - because Ryan is Mr. Popular. Rob comes across and someone who genuinely wants to invest in the team, town and all it entails.The Wrexham team is plenty entertaining. Getting to know the players and their families. What it's like for pro sports players to be sidelined, injured, etc. Plus you see just how many people are involved in making a pro team work.Wrexham is the underdog, a truly lovable one.Come on Wrexham!!",False
18,8,Entertaining & heart-warming. A winner.,StantonDrew,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs an Arsenal fan I've disliked Wrexham since 1992 when they had the temerity to knock us out of the FA Cup. So I went into this show with that long held antipathy towards the club.However, seeing the human side of a club and the town, what it means to those who work there & play for them, the supporters who invest a part of the soul to it, the roller-coaster of emotions - I couldn't help falling for them, just a little bit at first, and by the end of the series I was rooting for them to succeed even though I knew the outcome.Yes, there are some grating moments when (to me) obvious things have to be pointed out for the benefit of the american (& non-football following) viewers, and subtitling the locals even though they are speaking easily understandable English is just plain disrespectful. But I understand that to make the show as broadly appealing as possible it has to be accessible to all - so I can forgive these minor quibbles.Overall, this is an engaging, entertaining and heart-warming show.Looking forward to the next season with fingers crossed that this time they get promoted - which I would never have said this time last year!",True
19,10,"Never watched a football game, but this show is fantastic!",mignonette1,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who doesn't watch any sports except mma, this show is top-notch and I am now a Wrexham fan! The show does such an amazing job of showing us the heart of this team, and the heart of Wrexham. I think anybody that watches this show will have a new-found appreciation for the sport, the players, and even the die-hard fans. You can't help but celebrate the wins and grieve the losses, right along with them. The show is just so good!Another thing I like about this show is they haven't only focused on the team. There are quite a few Wrexham fans that we see over and over, letting us experience the team through the eyes of people for whom football is more than just a fun game.Highly recommended!",False
20,7,Must-see for any football (a/k/a soccer) fan,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As Episode 1 of ""Welcome to Wrexham"" (2022 release; 9 episodes of which 8 are about 22 min each and episode 9 is 47 min) opens, we are introduced to ""Wrexham, Wales"", population 68,000, whose football team now plays in the 5th tier of English football. In other words: down and possibly out. We then learn that Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney (""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") are interested in buying the team... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into Episode 1.Couple of comments: Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney not only have this crazy (in the best possible way) notion of buying a low-tiered soccer team but then came up with the even better idea of documenting the entire experience. The film makers were provided unfettered access and we get to see some amazing behind the scenes footage. The true winners in this all seem to be the good people of Wrexham, an industrial town that has seen better times (just like its soccer team). Their love for the football team is fierce and stubbornly proud. Production for this series started at the height of COVID in 2020, when no spectators were allowed in the stadiums. And of course one can't help but think about ""Ted ""Lasso"", but this stands nicely on its own and easily at the same level as ""Ted Lasso"".""Welcome to Wrexham"" started streaming recently on Hulu and the first 4 episodes are now available. Additional episodes are released on Wednesdays. Can't wait! If you are a fan of the beautiful game, or simply wat to get a glimpse what life is like in a seemingly forgotten place like Wrexham, Wales, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.*UPDATE 9/23/22* I've now seen all episodes of Season 1, and it is indeed for the most part enjoyable and likeable. For sure it helps if you like soccer, but at its very core this is more about the people that make up the community of Wrexham than it is about the fate of the soccer team. I must point out that the last episode (filmed a year ago) just ends, and... that's it. No update what has happened since then. Truly a headscratcher and questionable way to finish Season 1.",False
21,10,Must watch for both sports fans and non-sports fans.,jcpolm,n/a,16/08/2025,"One thing I love about this show is that it comes from the perspective of non-football fans. I never watched football (other than American football) but recently moved to Europe, and was always unable to connect with why it was the worlds most popular sport. This series makes it clear. I would recommend this series to anyone who doesn't appreciate sports, as it really puts a focus on why sports matter to people and to their communities.It's perfect as it also has the David vs. Goliath, underdog story. The passion of the community and players is undeniable.The complexity of running a club is another factor that is just extremely interesting.And on top you have Rob and Ryan who are undeniably both hilarious and fish out of water.It's a fascinating and oddly gripping show that anyone, both fans of the sport and not, can appreciate. And I feel it's difficult to not emotionally connect to the journey of every person focused on, whether it be the fans, the players, the owners.",False
22,6,"Great For A US Audience, A Little Too Polished For The UK",deepfrieddodo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Certainly a fun documentary to follow the inner workings of UK football, but compared to some of the grittier series produced for the likes of Leeds, Sunderland, Arsenal and Man City, it's really steered towards a US audience.It's a great story, and fact that the owners, Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds, produce the series means a crew isn't coming into a club after the major adjustments, meaning context can be given, therefore the true 'plot' begins when the documentary started filming.As it is produced by the owners, the series is always going to show every move or appointment they make as a positive one. Many of them are, and to their credit a whole episode is dedicated to hooliganism, showing it is a little 'warts and all' series. However, appointing Shaun Harvey and portraying him as best in the business is laughable from a football fan perspective. Four previous clubs, all into administration, two of which went under completely. Then moves on to lead a corrupt EFL. They have one moment in the series where a fan/volunteer questions his involvement, and then the narrative leaves it be. So they are showing all angles, but their enthusiasm to sing some praises seem like naivety.It's strange who they decide to give subtitles to, some of these accents are not difficult to understand, and even then they seem to get them wrong semi-regularly. Plus, minor things to someone outside of the UK, but showing clips of old Wembley when talking about the pitch of new Wembley just ignores details that don't fit into the rhetoric.Showing the deeper organisational things is great, e.g. Disability inclusion, however there is no real chronological order. For example, the Tiktok sponsorship deal, a big deal for the club, is brought in after its been seen on the kit for a few episodes. It doesn't go too in-depth on the marketing, showing the series is really a surface level introduction to UK sport for an American audience. With the right approach, sponsorship, TV deals, player negotiations can all be really interesting, but they're skimmed over.Personally, my biggest issue with the series is the suggestion that the fly-on-the-wall chats between fans, players, staff and the owners aren't staged. Particularly the phone calls between the owners, or two fans in a pub as if they don't know they're being recorded. The series lacks the realism of the All or Nothing or Sunderland Til I Die series.The penultimate episode exploring the father-son bond in sport was nice, yet entirely ruined by the self-appointed masculinity expert making sweeping generalisations.I'm a big fan of both McElhenney and Reynolds' individual works, and they have done wonders to Wrexham AFC, but keeping swearing into the series isn't the thing needed to be a proper portrayal of lower-league football.",False
23,5,"I was so looking forward to season 2, but it sucks!!!",syholl,n/a,16/08/2025,"Season one of Welcome to Wrexham was absolutely superb. It had everything, following the ups and downs of their first season with the new owners, and was a pleasant surprise to watch.At the end of the season I found myself jealous of the Wrexham fans, what a fantastic club to support.Season two comes along and is so completely different to the last series, I don't understand what has happened.Did a new team take over the directing, is it just a victim of its own success.....?No idea what happened, the episodes are really short now, just over 20 minutes each, and the football matches barely even get a mention.I made it half way through season 2 and that's enough. Too fake and scripted for my liking...!!",False
24,10,An emotional roller coaster,samanthagoodey,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watch a lot of tv, I rarely leave reviews. I urge everyone to watch this, regardless of whether you like this sport or not. The way it highlights community, humanity, passion, drive and the unknown is phenomenal. Massive credit to Ryan and the other guy (joke!) who I don't think saw this as a money making scheme, they genuinely care about what they are trying to achieve and really put effort in on top of cash. You can see the emotional investment from everyone within this show. It's beautiful and perfectly summarises humans to me. Please give a couple of episodes a go, you will not regret it.",False
25,9,Great little sports documentary,milts-22133,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wasn't sure what to expect from this but really glad I gave it a go. Not just about the team but the whole community and how big a part the club plays in some/most peoples lives. Being a massive football fan it's great to see what these little clubs have to go through from player wages to pitches, behind scenes etc. Really eye opening, knew that there was a massive gulf between this level and the premier league but even to the football league it's staggering to see how big a deal it is to get into the main tiers of the football league. Even if you're not a football fan this is enjoyable just for the people. Would've been a 10 out of 10 but the only bad point is the poxy subtitles, they're a proper distraction and totally unnecessary.",False

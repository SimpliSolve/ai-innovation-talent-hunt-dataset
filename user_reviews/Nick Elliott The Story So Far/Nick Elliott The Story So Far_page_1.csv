1,9,A compelling watch,andyblithe,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are many adages out there; you get the scene: wise sayings, meaningful truths and the like. There are two examples of this particular genre which come to mind. Why? Well let me tell you: they are printed on canvas and hang in my kitchen. One says 'keep calm and carry on.' The other says: 'housework can't kill you but why take the chance?' Both, of course, are true in so many ways. But, let's get to the heart of them. Calmness, in adversity, is a very noble trait. Avoiding risk is another prime example of practicality over possibility. Both, however, I would argue are subjective risks. I would ask you to bear this in mind when it comes to viewing 'The Story So Far' a biopic of the world famous rock photographer, Mr Nick Elliott, filmed by Mr Andy Blythe of 'Aturnfilms' (2023). Here is a film which is both thought provoking and desperate; a celebration of life and a cry for help; an articulation of a life well lived, and an acknowledgement of demons ever present. And, of course, the title of the film implies a consideration, at least, as to what is to follow. The entire premise of the film had me hooked immediately. It questions many assumptions I had believed applied to my life. It grapples with conundrums via an exquisite articulation of the human condition. It is a beautiful, yet challenging, watch. You can hang as many adages on your kitchen wall as you like, profound or not, but you will probably select to use the word 'displaying' rather than 'hanging' after viewing this masterpiece.So, what do we have? Essentially, in football parlance, we have 'a game of two halves.' In the opening few minutes, Nick is recorded as saying that he has 'been looking for a proper job since 1979.' By a strange quirk of fate, the exact same sentiment can be said of me, because in that year I entered the noble profession of teaching and stayed there until I retired. But there the similarities end: I did not have the balls to do something about it. Nick, on the other hand, did. As Nick mentions: for him '...the line moves all the time.' This film is witness to that.To keep the football analogy moving, the first part of the film, is a whistle-stop voyage through Nick's formative years and the influences they had on him. Through a series of reminiscences with people who have featured in Nick's life, ranging from friends, neighbours, his brother (who lovingly refers to Nick as a 'maverick',), work colleagues and show-business personalities, we get a glimpse of what it is that formulates his take on things. We are transported to various locations which have been a part of his life, and are regaled with stories about the significance of 'Number 51,' Peterborough Lido, privets, a 'fourteen hour coffee', not to mention useful advice on how to avoid the cross-country run at school, and contemplations on '...the moon and space and all that kind of stuff!' The second emphasis of the film, however, is by way of a complete contrast. Presented in atmospheric episodic clips, this part recounts, with absolute frankness, what Nick refers to as the dark art or, to use Nick's own words, the '...heavy *h*t.' It is not my remit here to give you a blow-by-blow account of the exact nature of what is revealed, suffice to say that it is shocking, mind-blowing, and deeply upsetting, if you want it to be. So, I am not offering a spoiler alert; there is no need to. But, I will say this: what is presented before you is, without doubt, totally honest; almost brutal, fringing on the surreal yet ultimately life-affirming because '...the chair slipped.' As Nick himself states: it has 'been a rough trip but a good trip' and a trip that he would happily take again. Thank God for that.Can I offer any criticism? Not really. I was left wanting more. I wanted to learn more about the enigma that is Nick Elliott; his hopes, his fears, his motivation, his spirituality and his reasoning. But, there's the rub, as Shakespeare once put it. This is a film about the story so far. I hope that probably, possibly, there is a fantastic tale yet to be revealed. In other words, let's hope there is more to come from this enigmatic and inspiring soul.Christopher M. Moore,",False
2,9,Great,amyharris-28112,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nick Elliott shares some insight with his skeletons, demons and rock art photography with this well made documentary created by Aturn Films' Andy Blithe (Buying Time, Heart of a Lion). The two partner up and tell a remarkable story about mental health and the struggles of being the everyday man. Nick takes iconic pictures of some of England's most popular musicians and does a good job at expositioning them. He's not afraid to share his story and troubled past to the public. It's a fearless documentary that most people need to see. Not for the faint hearted as it contains moments of ""self-death""",False
3,9,Nick Elliott: Grounded,tonyburran,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nick Elliott is one of the well known rock art photographers in music history. We always hear about the artist and their creativity, but we never know the team behind the curtains. One of them in particular is this chap. In this feature documentary directed and shot by Andy Blithe tells a dark tale about mental illness and how Nick comes to terms with these sinister thoughts, despite that life has punched him in the stomach a number of times. He still gets up and makes something creative and meaningful only to him. I like documentaries like this cause it felt raw and genuine all the way. Very well made film.",False

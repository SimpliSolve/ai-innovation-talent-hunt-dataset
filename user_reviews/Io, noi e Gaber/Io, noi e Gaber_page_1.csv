1,7,Trani a Go Go!,Boskizzi,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is not bad at all. For my personal taste, I would have preferred it a bit shorter, however. In some cases the footage seemed to me weighed down by unnecessary frills, too many people walking around unnecessarily. I would also have liked a more conspicuous presence of singing and a few more glimpses of the Milan of yesteryear, the one Gaber frequented. Poetic and tear-jerking ending. I am sorry Beppe Viola is never mentioned. Antonio Albanese is also seen only once: too little. In any case, I recommend its viewing to lovers of the Milanese singer. And don't forget... Trani a go go!",False

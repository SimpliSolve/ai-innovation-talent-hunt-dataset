1,8,She is the best,Ameliex,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think a lot of people out there can relate to her and her life. Not that they are famous etc, but the human stuff every human goes through. All the hardship, trauma, childhood, love, career and life etc.This documentary was really good, and better than I thought it would be.Pamela is such a sweetheart, she is such a lovely person. This was the first documentary that I had seen about her. I had no idea that she is this down-to-earth sweetheart.As she is telling her story and going through all the stuff that she went through, you can sense those emotions too. When she was telling the stories about her having fun, you felt joy watching this and when she told the dark stories of hardship, you felt sadness.I love that we got to see that soft side of her.100% I recommend you see this!",False
2,8,Impressive! Pam came out a winner after decades of turmoil.,accounts-54039,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a fan of Pamela or Tommy. In fact, I pretty much hate celebrities, in general. Just because a person can ""play a musical instrument"" or ""pretend for a living"" shouldn't automatically give them the high power status that it now does in our society. With that said, I think this movie does a wonderful job of showing the true characters of Pam & Tommy. Their core values are solid and if you can ignore their celebrity occupations (and the glitter that surrounds that) then you can really see how loving and true they are as human beings. If I were their sons, then there is nothing that I would be ashamed about as having Pam & Tommy as my parents.Pam's mistakes are that she keeps looking for a happy marriage (REPEAT: she is NOT a bad adult and NOT a bad mother). That message of her strength and core value is clear in this movie and listening to this stripped down ""the real Pam"" version makes the viewers want her to someday find the love and happiness that she so badly is looking for whether it be forever alone or with someone else.",False
3,8,Norma Jean of the 21st century,RedKidBytes,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPamela Anderson was thrown into fame after a divine intervention allowed her to be selected for a picture opportunity out of the thousands in a football game, which ended up in the hands of the Play Boy recruiters. The savvy makeup artists crafted her into flaming beauty with beach blond hair, simmering blue eyes and illustrious lips curved to perfection. Over a night, she was every men's dream. And every girl wanted to be like her.However, she moved to Los Angeles at a time when deplorables like Harvey Weinstein and such were kings. She famously played in Bay Watch, which further cemented her as the ultimate sex symbol. As though she wanted a breakthrough from this mold, Hollywood was the good 'ol boys network (and it still is) and most notable interests in her required further exploitation of Pamela as a person.I could not even fathom how difficult it would be for a young girl with beauty to perfection to come from a small island town in Vancouver to be thrown into the hands of the wolfs' of Hollywood. But she stands on her two feet anyway and her only self-defeating prophecy is that she's afraid to be alone. Perhaps, one of the reasons why she goes through men like a deck of cards. Maybe marriage is financial security or everyone she meets is not Tommy her only love. Maybe dating is underrated. Who knows?Toward the end, there are a few clips from Pamela's newest endeavor. She plays Roxie Hart in Broadway's Chicago. In production for nearly 25 years, she sings, dances, and receives many accolades.Anyone can ace in Broadyway can ace anywhere. I for one, look forward to seeing her on the screen again.",True
4,n/a,An emotionally informative doc,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI think what made me want to watch this the most was to find out what the Pam & Tommy show missed or got wrong, as well as Anderson not initially wanting to revisit her past because it affected her life so much. You can really get an up close look at how down to earth she is as a person and not the sex icon the media made her out to be.One of the most painful parts about her relationships is how her lifestyle basically decided what kind of people she would meet or end up with. It seems now she is aware that she is probably better off on her own and is aware that she owes no one anything. She lived in a time where the media had absolutely no filter with the questions she would get asked.",True
5,7,Its Makes Her a Person Not A Poster,damianphelps,n/a,16/08/2025,"A nice 3D depiction of a woman mostly presented in 2D.PALS gives Pamela the opportunity to express herself and its as insightful and it is beautiful.My stomach turned after watching her express the pain of the sex tape being returned to the spotlight in the short tv series that really lived to cash in on her true distress. It was a dirty action by the tv show's creators.A women who presents at the same time as both insecure and assured, Pamela is an emigma.Her decision to take on Broadway was bold and inspired.I didn't have an opinion of Pamela as a person before watching the movie, I had enjoyed her talents but I found myself really liking the person she seems to be :)",False
6,10,"Absolutely amazing, honest and sweet documentary",boself,n/a,16/08/2025,"I rarely like documentaries about famous people because it almost always seems like this big ego thing. I promised myself just five minutes of this documentary to see what Pamela looks like now. I'm a middle aged woman, I grew up with this famous lady and we believed what the media told us. Back then we did. Not now anymore. We're older and wiser. I guess
And today at the start of the documentary I was expecting to see something entirely different than what I got. And this truly amazing portrait of Pamela, this honest and sweet woman, mesmerized me. I'm so glad this was made for us to see. Pamela, what a truly remarkable human being you are. Xox.",False
7,7,"Her story is not a ""woe is me"" story",Shenoa77,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't know much about Pamela Anderson Lee outside of the sex icon, Baywatch, and her marrying rocker Tommy Lee, so wasn't sure what to expect. Her story is inspiring, it's honest, transparent and makeup-free. She's a survivor and her story is an unabashed, unscripted tale of survival. Much respect to you, Pamela, for this sneak peek into your past, present and future. Your legacy isn't going to be that horrible tape but the two beautiful, loving sons you've raised so well.

8,9,Who knew I would absolutely love Pamela Anderson,winterfire448,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ok, so as a 33 year old I was a bit young to really follow the Pamela Anderson of the 90s. The only things I ever really knew about her were that she was a blonde model who was naked a lot and was in some sex tape. I had seen her on stuff I guess, but never really even thought of her other than as ""the blonde bimbo"".After watching this I'm both sad and happy for that. Having not followed it, I have never seen said tape and I didn't watch the Hulu series. I'm SO glad for that because now that I know she didn't have any part in either of those things I wouldn't want to give them my attention anyway.Pamela seems like such a genuine soul who is on this earth to love. I'm sad I never knew how she advocated for animals. She has such a pure heart and it really showed in this doc. Her sons clearly love her as much as she loves them and I love their fun dynamic.I was crying like a baby listening to her talk about Tommy. Wow, I never knew they were so in love. But huge respect to her for leaving when she knew she needed to. And I just love how she didn't say a single bad word about anyone. She just doesn't seem like the type who would.",False
9,7,Pamela a different side of a star,nickgreek1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen you are thinking of Pamela you think that she is a star that she wouldn't say Elton even a simple hi to you
But you see thag she is a so simple person ,so nice woman who always wanted to meet the big love ! I think she made two big mistakes in her life ,one that she didn't tried to fix the relationship with her big love and the father of her kids ,and 2nd she didn't sign for the video to get Milions not for herself but for her kids ,the video was playing eligal in Internet so she could stop this,at the end he's son said the same it was just a signatureüòè, it's a vey good film to see how s simple ordinary girl became a star.",True
10,9,Finally we get to see the Woman,la_rubiecita,n/a,16/08/2025,"Please watch this. Finally we get to see the woman behind the image.Firstly, she's a sweetheart. Thoughtful, with a wicked dark sense of humor, completely aware of her own flaws. She's also deeply hurt how she was played and portrayed due to that awful sex tape affair that well, still is impacting her live today, through no fault of her own. There was no #metoo yet, she got mauled by the machinery yet came out on the other end to tell the tale.I love how she's a woman of today, taking responsibility of the mess but at the same time working what she's got to the fullest. Her search of true love is endearing, her embracing aging refreshing (I'd love to see Jlo shoot a doc without make up). The very loving relationship with her sons shows you who she really is.I'd also like to remark how unbelievably beautiful and photogenic she was. I think as a society we could not look past that, we kind of did not allow her ever to really be anything else then something of a silicon doll, which, in view how she wrapped the audience around her finger in the musical Chicago, is a total waste.In any case, as a fellow Canadian I was happy to see that she's okay. Happy, still searching for love, but happy.",False
11,7,"Revealing documentary, but becomes a little overstuffed by the end",wellthatswhatithinkanyway,n/a,16/08/2025,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulBorn in Canada on 1st of July 1967, Pamela Anderson was the country's 'Centenial Baby' (born one hundred years after the country's founding by the US constitution) but was to go on to even greater things. After fleeing an abusive home life, she traveled to America, where she was discovered at a sports game wearing a Labatt's t-shirt, and from there went on to model for Playboy. From there, Pamela's life was thrust in to a whirlwind rollercoaster ride, gaining a starring role in popular TV show Baywatch, a subsequent film career, before a hasty marriage to rock star Tommy Lee, and a sex tape that was stolen. In the present day, she reflects on the past, while preparing to reinvent herself in a Broadway production of Chicago.As a male belonging to the 'millennial' generation, Pamela Anderson was a name that many of us would remember on our emergence into adolescence. This documentary aims to deliver a more humanised account of the woman behind the fantasy, and reveals a character with more depth and intelligence than was ever hinted at at the height of her fame.Quite easily the most upsetting revelation on hand is what a damaged soul she actually is, revealing accounts of abuse that she suffered in her home town, and when she arrived in the States, a disturbingly common theme we've learned exists over the years among many young women who were drawn to the pornography industry. Despite the scars she must be carrying from this, Pamela has an undeniable 'survivor' quality, completely refusing to be a victim. It's this strength of character that must have helped her survive the 'sex tape' ordeal she went through, losing a court battle to get it banned, and having to endure the double standard at the time of being shamed as a woman for being involved, while her rocker husband escaped relatively unscathed. She was never accepted as a great actress, but then it may just have been the parts she was offered, never being taken seriously as an ex Playboy model, and so not being given a serious chance to show her range. Hopefully, her shot on Broadway might change people's perception of her.It reveals a lot, but sadly towards the end it does start to feel a little over-indulgent, with too many events in her later life crammed in just to tell her whole story, without getting enough depth to properly examine them. All the same, it's still a revealing account of a striking individual, as passionate about her campaigning works and as whatever project she gets involved in. ***",False
12,10,Fabulous,joanneeccles-55847,n/a,16/08/2025,"Growing up watching baywatch, I've always loved Pamela, I wanted to be her like most girls did , watching this documentary she comes across as funny and so down to earth, her boys are are credit to her, she is a strong woman just wanting that fairytale, and my god I hope she gets it, it's also very refreshing to see a woman on tv without a bit of makeup on, not that she needs it for she is truly beautiful, how she was treated when her sex tape came out was horrific, she was portrayed as a slut, I hope whoever stole it and the people that released it watch this and are fully ashamed of themselves.",False
13,7,We See Her,Veronika1212,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Pamela I have seen over and over has a great sense of humor all the while proud of her body and her sexuality. Seeing this side to her, jumping in love for the want of being in love, is allowing us to see her raw. I admire her strength and her honesty. It takes courage to be able to let it all hang out. It takes courage to take a walk back and look at journals and footage, and let the truth be recorded. Love feels like she dives in, while being in the present, takes a chance on love and the person in front of her. THAT takes courage. Pamela let's us in to watch her at her most sensitive. I admire her and thank you Pamela for showing us what we all want, we all want to be loved.",False
14,2,Nothing New,jacqui-296-57454,n/a,16/08/2025,"This story has very little that hasn't already been shown on other documentaries or interviews. I was hoping to see a side of Pam that was deeper or more interesting than what we've seen before, but that is sadly not the case. Additionally, Pam continues to act offended that there's so much focus on her body, taking no responsibility for the situation, even though she paraded around, half dressed, and numerous Playboy magazine appearances. In fact, Pamela Anderson would have no career without her body. She sites interviews with people like Jay Leno, where she feels offended by the focus on her breast, yet she's always wearing something super tight or low cut. Cry me a river.I do think she had a rough childhood, with an abusive father and was sexually abused by more than one person. As a result, she went on to make terrible decisions with men.I also have to give her kudos for filming without makeup! She's still a beautiful woman in a natural way.",False

Pamela believes she's an architect, a poet, a seamstress, a Gardiner extraordinaire, a model, a mother, a wife, a life guard, a swimmer, a love rat, a vegan, a producer, an actor,... a Canadian.This show is very sentimental, and for all the right reasons.Ms Anderson could take two steps back, left,...and likely this will assure future credibility.

16,7,Good and interesting,claudiamtc,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was surprised on how interesting the documentary was. Even emotional in the end.I didn't know much about her story, but it's worth to watch.She's had a hard childhood, I think I'm not giving a higher rating because she talked a little too lightly about it. She also had a lot of good moments in life, and a lot of moments where she definitely made wrong choices but she's owning them. I think family is very important for Pamela, and everyone can relate to that. Her kids are super cute and look so balanced after so much that happened.Empowering film, felt pretty authentic. Loved the no make-up. Very beautiful!",False
17,10,Beautiful,ikillam,n/a,16/08/2025,"At first I wondered why is this called ""A love story"", but once I watched, I understood. Her story is so raw, but also romantic. Pamela is such a sweet hearted woman, despite everything she has been through. She is clearly such a good Mother who would do anything for her kids. You watch this and love just pours at you from the screen. Every word she says. She's not bitter, she could be, most people would, but she's just kind. She's goofy, her smile lights you up inside. This is a love story about all the love Pamela Anderson has given and continues to give everyone in her life. It's a shame that she was exploited so much for so many years and even to this day. I am so glad this documentary was done so tastefully. It was truly poetic. Worth watching for certain. Pamela Anderson is just a lovable soul. She's timeless, too. Before watching this, I aspired to have her beauty. But now I aspire to have her childlike optimism and her kind heart. By the time you finish this documentary you'll be in love with this amazing woman.",False
18,7,Pam finally takes control of her narrative! [+72%],arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's beautiful getting to hear Pamela candidly recall various highs and lows in her journey of life. Not only does the documentary highlight her most unfiltered and vulnerable moments, but it also remains faithful to the core idea that someone who has been through several instances of abuse, failed marriages, and insane levels of media objectification can still rise above it all if she simply decides to.Pam's life was paparazzi-filled, and since mainstream media was quick to deem her a sex symbol as she was involved in Playboy, I feel she was never given her due especially in cinema. What changed everything was the sex-tape scandal, and it actually felt gratifying to learn what Pam thought of it all. She even jokes about falling in and out of love, and therefore, it's incredibly easy to understand her choices and decisions.What's also wonderful to see is Pam's equation with her two sons - Brandon and Dylan. They've come of age to fully grasp the kind of life their parents lived, treat it with the maturity and composure it needs, and most importantly, be happy for who they are right now.",False
19,10,Excellent,dharrison-46526,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a lovely woman. I found this so moving and a few times crying when she was reflecting on her relationship with Tommy Lee. She's clearly done an excellent job raising her two amazing sons who love and respect her deeply. I admire her for what she's been through at times have been horrific and she keeps going. I don't want to give any spoilers but towards the end your really rooting for her and she succeeds!!! I really hope she continues her incredible life with success, good health and finally the love of a man who deserves her. This is a well made documentary, totally unfiltered and for people who want to know more about her and what's happened, don't watch the tv series, which wasn't even authorised by her, watch this. It's her life, hear it from her only. Thoroughly enjoyed this.",False
20,7,The rise and fall and rise again of a cultural icon,Everybody_Comes_To_Ricks,n/a,16/08/2025,"I more or less grew up at the same time as Pamela Anderson, and lived through her magazine covers, ""Baywatch,"" ""VIP"" (which I actually kind of liked), her romances including the four-day whirlwind courtship with and subsequent marriage to Tommy Lee. Then came the stolen sex tape, after which Anderson more or less disappeard from public life.I am very happy to see that a couple of decades later, she returns in this very good first-person documentary. She vulnerably opens up about how she was discovered, her time with Playboy, how the sex tape scandal emotionally affected her and ultimately destroyed her career. Even at the point of recording the documentary, recounting that time brings her to tears.I did not hear, but at the time of filming the documentary, she was invited to play the role of Roxi in a production of ""Chicago,"" apparantly to positive reviews. Here's hoping (if she wishes) that this leads to opportunities to return to acting.Recommended.",False
21,10,Don't call me a victim,aidancarney,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA woman exploited & abused throughout her life but she wants to be seen as resilient and not a victim. It's a powerful message; indeed she is resilient and not a victim but I was quite struck by how frank she was about being sexually abused as a child, then for the documentary to show how she was mercilessly sexually abused again in adulthood by the leaked sex tape, only to be blamed and deemed as not having rights to sexual privacy because she posed for Playboy. In the deeply misogynistic 90's America she was treated no better than a sex worker despite being one of the most famous women in the world. Now what does that tell you about how America views women?",True
22,6,Raw and sad but missing something,cindyrellaexists,n/a,16/08/2025,"It seems to be an ode to what she clearly feels is her true love, Tommy Lee. It's a revealing tale but she's not saying much about her health or rumored hepatitis diagnosis. In as much as it's wonderful she has overcome being molested and raped as a child why not use her platform advocating against child exploitation? She stayed true to her desire to be a mom and her love for them is obvious. It was nice of her to share what she did but it was ultimately a sad thing. She didn't deserve to be treated like she did after that tape was stolen. May she continue to find peace and happiness away from Hollywood.",False
23,10,Some people stand in the darkness... she was not.,fenialagiou,n/a,16/08/2025,"We have all been aware of the terrible things Pamela Anderson had to suffer. The 90s were brutal to her. Actually this is the first period of time that so many people realize what she's been through .I have always admired her kindness. The interviews I've seen were humiliating. I have always also hated the Penthouse magazine and the so called ""journalists ""because of what they did to Pamela. She does the best thing here pointing facts with her uniqueness and her laugh. She is a nice person who doesn't have the need to tear anyone apart. This makes the way she speaks quite sentimental.I wish she is happy cause sometimes she seems so sad. And she never hurt anyone. She is an actual lady according to her character and it's so obvious here. I really like the way she speaks parts of her story.She tried to do her best and I believe she did.Overall the best thing is that you get the idea of the real Pamela. And I love this.",False

She says what happened with after effects of the tape being stolen .. and how that alone kaboshed the rest of her career. All I can say is to any other celebrity out there .... dont tape anything ... it may not last private for long. Then just recently they do a mini doc on it and there it is all again ... FK!I am somewhat surprised at all the other tapes she does have and maybe if THE tape was with those ones it may have been safe. Who knows.Most of all I really did enjoy seeing her rehearse for ""Chicago"" for Broadway and she got rave reviews. I have to agree with her sons statement ... ""everyone thought she would fail miserably"" and they were wrong. I also thought the same thing when I saw she was going into it ... shocked me as well.I hope she has great sucesss with her book. Go Pam Go.",False
25,2,An attempt to rewrite history,protektors,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pamela made all these choices in the past that she regrets. Much of the things she blames as attacks on her were because of the choices she made at the time. I remember when she made these choices & liked them & was proud of them. Now she is embarrassed by her choices & wants to blame others for them. It is just sad. Often sex symbols & porn actresses are proud of their work & call it liberating & their choice not to be pigeon holed, but regret it later in life. They have no one to blame but herself. She chose to show up naked a Playboy parties, no one forced her. So now she isn't proud of her choices & blames people for exploiting & attacking her. She brought all of it on herself with her choices. Stop trying to rewrite history when you don't like the results of the choices you made.",False

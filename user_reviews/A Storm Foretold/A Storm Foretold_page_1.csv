1,8,Rage against the machine,pbczf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don't depend on Roger Stone for your livelihood is one life lesson director Christopher Guldbransen almost learned too late. Stone withdrew his cooperation for Guldbransen's documentary midway through the project, no doubt contributing to the director's cardiac arrest, which was nearly fatal. Life lesson two: always work out next to a heart surgeon.Guldbransen started following and filming the Nixon-fetishist and political dirty trickster Stone in 2018 and planned to continue through the 2020 elections. The aim seems to have been to see the U. S. presidential election through the eyes of someone close to Donald Trump. But what does 'close' even mean to such transactional creatures as Stone and Trump? When Stone finds that Trump has stiffed him by not inviting him to speak at the Jan. 6 rally on the Mall in Washington, D. C., he retreats to his hotel room to watch the day's events on TV. On the phone Stone admits Biden won the election, saying of Trump's campaign, 'That's why they lost: they don't know what they're doing.' Then when the insurrectionists begin their assault on the Capitol, Stone and his little entourage leave D. C. as quickly as possible for Florida, expecting all the while to be charged and arrested. As it turns out, even here Stone seems to have misjudged his centrality to the story, since he was not one of the more than 1,000 people eventually charged.In the end, this is not the portrait of a political genius pulling strings behind the curtain, but of a sad little man, always in the middle of things in his own mind, tossing others and being tossed himself from one transactional relationship to another. Most of all, as the many verbal, facial, and manual tics attest, it is a life driven by the qualities Stone enumerates in a frothing diatribe: hate, rage, and viciousness.",False
2,8,this is a real documentary movie should be,new859,n/a,16/08/2025,"Didn't expect this movie had so much precious footage. I really don't like those so called documentaries with a lot of second hand interviews without real footage of the person involved in the actual event. But this movie provides viewers a feast of real footage. I don't understand why Roger Stone allow the film maker to record so many his shady deals. It really opened my eyes. The editing is not so good. I think the director should not include his own ""episode"" into the film. It breaks the flow of story telling. Instead, he should put more Roger Stone's footage in the film. Just can't get enough of this interesting character.",False
3,10,Rare inside view into January 6 and the minds of Trump's orbit,galaxyge,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentation provides a rare inside view into January 6 and the mind of a central member of Trump's orbit - Roger Stone, a 40-year long supporter and enabler of Trump(ism).Stone allowed the director to get a close inside view of his activities, and his thinking up to and during the events of January 6, 2021.A portrait of narcicism and vanity.The director includes part of his personal efforts and health issues during the making, which is understandable due to the obvious relation to his work.At the screening in Zurich's ZFF the viewers were stunned over most part of the movie, leaving one shocked and amazed.Brilliant!",False
4,10,Essential viewing,INNERLMNT,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI always wondered what it's like in the lives of Trump allies, and this film gives the answer to one of them. It teaches you more than you would learn from Trump himself, about how difficult he can be, even at points empathizing with the key characters - Stone and the film's director himself. It is a peek into the people who believe reality is something to be challenged, and it's fascinating to see them try. The anger near the end is truly felt as the man who played the Jiminy Cricket of the former President's life is suddenly kept out of the occasion he has worked for the most. Essential viewing for all.",True
5,10,Learn More in 90 Minutes About US Extreme Right Attitudes,cramondperry-15015,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirstly congratulations to the Danish Fil Institute for commissioning and the BBC for buying this brilliant documentary and secondly a huge congratulations to the Producer Christopher for his understated commentary and production. This really gives you an insight into the psyche of the tribal ""followers"" of Trump and people like him. It also shows how these same people lie to and manipulate their own followers preying on the followers vulnerabilities and (n most cases Iignorant) prejudices.Roger Stone is quite interesting in a car crash sort of way. The opening sequence captures him perfectly in a 20 second shot as a vain, smug,arrogant, narcissist. As a supposed master communicator it is jaw-dropping cringeworthy moment that sets the scene. His mantra is reputed to be ""Attack, attack, attack - never defend"" and ""Admit nothing, deny everything, and launch a counterattack"". Strangely this is almost the same advice Donald Trumps daddy's lawyer gave to Trump.One fact that I found fascinating was that the Stop The Steal strategy to undermine a defeat was not a spontaneous response to a surprise defeat in 2020 but had been part of the overall strategy back in 2015/16 as they expected to lose.The closing sequence where Stone seems almost apoplectic with rage and fury is the true man. Self absorbed, sad, cast aside by Trump. Trump used him and dumped him in the same way Stone used the Proud Boys and fled like a coward from town when the violence erupted.By the way the filming and editing was also wonderful (normally you don't notice this). Notice the street signs near the very end in last 3 minutes : ""End of Road"" and ""End of School Zone"" and listen to the overlaid commentary is genius.I can't commend this documentary enough!",True

1,9,Wonderful in any language,screenidol,n/a,16/08/2025,"I speak only a little German, so there was a lot in ""Wunderland"" that I didn't understand. But having been to ""Miniatur Wunderland"" (Miniature Wonderland) in Hamburg, Germany, I had a clear idea of what they were talking about. It helps that I love the place and consider it one of the top man-made wonders in the world. The film, expertly directed, beautifully photographed and superbly edited, does it proud in showing off some of the extraordinary creations within this miniature land, one in which they are continually adding continents and countries; The Guinness Book of Records lists it as the largest miniature railway in the world. The opening sequence in the film is in itself spectacular.But the story is fascinating as well. How two twin-brothers who grew up as best friends imagined and created such a fantastical world is a precious story. And can serve as an inspiration. The details are incredible--in Miniature Wunderland's actual layouts as in the film--and there are lots of special moments shared with the viewers: regrets voiced by the brothers' father, the reason behind the graves being shown in one of the church scenes, the collaboration with an Argentinian group of artisans, to name a few.Miniatur Wunderland has always been a place not to miss. Now there is a film about it that counts also as a must-see. The film is in German (with some Spanish with German voice-over), but, curiously, the end credits were in English, suggesting that maybe the film exists somewhere with English subtitles. If not, it should!",False
2,9,Brought me in tears,sinscopefilms,n/a,16/08/2025,"First Impression:
The opening of ""Wunderland"" immediately captivated me, with its powerful, emotionally charged music setting a profound tone that moved me to tears not once, but three times.The Positives:
The cinematography is truly stunning, turning each scene into a visual feast. The emotional impact is what truly standed out to me. Watching two brothers relentlessly following their dreams is incredibly inspiring. The documentary highlights their collaborative nature, showcased through diligently conducted interviews and precise editing.Old videotapes add an authentic, raw touch to the narrative, blending smoothly with the polished cinematic footage. It really felt to me like I was watching a documentary film directed by Christopher Nolan due to the similarities in visual storytelling and story per se. The dedication and passion evident in the creative process of crafting the miniatures were both fascinating and moving, showcasing the team's commitment to their art.The Mixed:
Although the documentary was visually impressive, I wished it was longer to explore the creative processes more instead of focusing mainly on interviews.In the old footage videos, I felt like I needed subtitles because I could not catch the words they were saying. This minor tweak could greatly improve viewer understanding and engagement.In addition, the theme music repeats 4-5 times during the film, which I found a bit too much which I found excessive and somewhat bothersome.Conclusion:
""Wunderland"" is a beautifully crafted documentary that skillfully balances emotional depth with aesthetic brilliance. Despite its few shortcomings, the film left a lasting impression, moving me to tears. A 9/10 rating feels just right, reflecting a cinematic experience that's as unforgettable as it is emotional. This documentary not only showcases the power of perseverance and passion but also serves as a reminder of the beauty that lies in the pursuit of one's dreams.",False
3,9,Great!,michael-a-meier,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would not have thought a documentation about miniature wonderland could be this entertaining. In fact, this is more than a documentation and at the same time a small biography of the two brothers Frederick and Gerrit. I have not been to the Miniatur Wonderland in Hamburg myself, nor have I seen any other documentations, but that doesn't matter. I also don't think it's necessary to be a modelling freak to like this movie, the fascination, enthusiasm and dedication for this hobby or profession is very well transported. Very well done and one of the most entertaining documentations I have ever seen. Not a minute of it is boring.",False
4,10,Wonderful journey about Germany's biggest tourist attraction of all time,michaelmommsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"An emotional journey through one's own childhood and a wonderful documentary about Germany's biggest tourist attraction of all time. 93 minutes fly by, because this movie stops time very emotionally and brings out the child in every visitor. Anyone who has not yet been to Wonderland should go there with their children, an unforgettable experience for the whole family.The love that Gerrit and Frederic Braun have for each other as twins and the way they talk about their parents who died far too soon is heart-warming.ðŸ’•In the harsh reality, the whole thing is even more emotional and poignant. It's nice that something like this even exists in this day and age! A movie for all adult children who have not yet broken the bridge to their childhood.",False
5,7,German Documentary about MINIATUR WUNDERLAND in Hamburg,ZeddaZogenau,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the 1990s, twin brothers Gerrit and Frederik BRAUN earned their money with the techno disco ""Voila"" in Hamburg's Conventstrasse. But even then they were pursuing their dream of a miniature version of the world with corresponding figures and trains. After the turn of the millennium, the time had come. The MINIATUR WUNDERLAND / MINIATURE WONDERLAND was opened in the Speicherstadt, and has since developed into one of the biggest public attractions in the Hanseatic city of Hamburg. Even demonstratively disinterested teenage students can be thrilled by this attraction.In her documentary, director Sabine HOWE tells the story of how this tourist attraction, which has attracted worldwide attention, came about and introduces the creators of this amazing miniature world. Of course, this would not have been possible without the passionate model makers who have worked for the MINIATURE WONDERLAND over the last two decades. But of course, such tinkerers are not only found in Germany. The Argentinian model-making family Martinez also contributed a lot to the success of the attraction in the Speicherstadt with their version of the Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro.Gerrit and Frederik BRAUN, the main creators, appear in the lovingly designed documentary as small figures who lead the audience through the magical world of Wonderland. There are a lot of things to discover that you wouldn't have seen otherwise.Well worth seeing!",False
6,4,More a documentary about the founding brothers and their personalities,hamburgjoanna,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerVisually and animation-wise really beautiful, original and captivating. Apart from that it was more a documentary about the founding brothers and their personalities rather than about the Miniaturwunderland itself and how it functions. The two brothers receive a lot of screen time speaking about each other and themselves. I had hoped to learn more about how such a complex form of organisation works, it's challenges and it's technologies. It wasn't omitted completely but it wasn't the focus of the documentary.Also I felt uncomfortable when the relationship between the German and the Argentinian teams were portrayed - for the first the cooperation was apparently somewhat interesting and a bit challenging and for the latter it was portrayed as profoundly, emotionally life changing. The way it was recounted, it felt like a weirdly imbalanced portrayal. Hard to say if it was a cinematographic choice to portray it this way or wether it reveals the real imbalance in how they approached each other, I feel like it's more a clichÃ© like and frankly cringe worthy cinematography choice.",True

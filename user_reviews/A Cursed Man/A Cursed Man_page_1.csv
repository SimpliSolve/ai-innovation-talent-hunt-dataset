1,9,Interesting documentary,cwells-575-680347,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Cursed Man is a really interesting documentary because it deals with the supernatural and asks the question: What if the filmmaker gets cursed to see if it's real? Hell yeah, I want to see that. Even if you don't believe in being cursed, why would anyone risk it by willingly being the recipient? Well, thankfully, Liam Le Guillou, the director and star, allows that to happen to him. And we're not talking about a good luck curse-he allows a dark curse, and the way he engages with people who specialize in the dark arts, is a fun way to learn about this world.A cool aspect of this documentary goes into how Voodoo and witchcraft are all about being interconnected and how the mind can influence our physical being. I kind of now want to study Voodoo. One Voodoo priest even calls out the filmmaker by calling him entitled to want to be cursed, and I'm so happy they left that in because it gives the doc more credibility.The doc follows Liam who travels all over the world talking with different people who are either experts in black magic or scientists who can put a scientific spin on things.It's beautifully shot and moves pretty fast. It's worth watching not only to see how the curses affect the filmmaker but also for the intriguing inside look into this dark world from a skeptical filmmaker's perspective.",False
2,9,A CURSED MAN (Film Review),Write_Now_2025,n/a,16/08/2025,"A CURSED MANGripping and unsettling, A Cursed Man is a fascinating dive into the unknown that challenges the boundaries of belief and reality. Filmmaker Liam Le Guillou embarks on a daring experiment, subjecting himself to alleged dark magic to test its effects firsthand. What follows is a tense and thought-provoking journey that blends eerie encounters with scientific insight, raising profound questions about the power of the mind and the consequences of belief.The documentary's strength lies in its ability to maintain a sense of skepticism while fully immersing the audience in an unsettling atmosphere. Le Guillou approaches his subject with both curiosity and caution, leading to moments that are as unnerving as they are revelatory. The film masterfully balances eerie rituals with expert analysis, creating an experience that is both chilling and intellectually stimulating.Visually, A Cursed Man leans into its eerie subject matter with haunting cinematography that enhances the tension. Dark, shadowy settings and ominous sound design heighten the film's unsettling tone, making even the most skeptical viewer feel a creeping sense of unease. Yet, beneath the supernatural elements, the documentary also delves into the psychology of fear, suggestion, and belief, revealing how the mind can manifest real consequences from perceived threats.Whether you approach it as an investigation of dark magic or a psychological experiment, A Cursed Man is undeniably compelling. It lingers long after the credits roll, leaving viewers to question the true power of curses - whether supernatural or self-inflicted.A must-watch and well worth the price of admission.",False
3,n/a,A Cursed Viewer,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat begins as a potentially intriguing exploration of global curse culture devolves quickly into a hot mess of scripted theatrics, red LED lighting, and faux-spiritual LARPing. A Cursed Man presents itself as a quasi-skeptical man's journey into the world of black magic, but it quickly reveals its true identity: a 98-minute s√©ance of bad documentary filmmaking.The film's protagonist, allegedly a quasi-skeptic, sets out to get himself cursed by visiting witch doctors, Satanists, tantrics, and voodoo priests. Sounds spooky-n-wild, right? Except every moment feels so painfully staged that it's hard not to burst out laughing. The ""Mexican Satanist"" who claims Satan cured his alcoholism? Please. With fiery pentagrams, cringy refrains of ""Help us Lord Satan"" prayers, and red LED floodlights bathing the patio like a spirit Halloween rave, this sequence alone deserves an Emmy for Best Unintentional Comedy.And just when you think it couldn't get dumber, the film ends with the protagonist opening a medical envelope, on camera, to reveal his blood test results. The implication? That he didn't have hereditary cancer because some L. A. ""white witch"" coven performed a healing spell. If that logic offends your intelligence, congratulations: you still have some.The filmmakers coyly dance around reality, never committing to full skepticism or full woo, hoping the ambiguity will pass for profundity. It doesn't. It's manipulative, emotionally exploitative, and borderline insulting to actual cultural traditions. Worse, it wastes your time. 98 Mins I shall never get back!!!FINAL VERDICT: This isn't a documentary... it's paranormal cosplay dressed up as investigative journalism. It tries so hard to look ""edgy"" that it accidentally becomes camp. The only thing truly cursed here was my evening.",True
4,10,Great subject,vhitaqad,n/a,16/08/2025,"I truly enjoyed A Cursed Man. It raises compelling questions about belief, fate, and the power of ritual. Are we genuinely connected to a higher power, or is it our belief system that gives meaning to these experiences? It was fascinating to watch, especially the moment when Liam asked to be cursed. I kept wondering how he felt in that moment, was it fear, conviction, or curiosity? How did he rationalize such a bold act? Is it possible that the power of suggestion alone can trigger real change through ritual? This documentary stays with you and challenges your understanding of cause and effect.",False
5,10,Decent watch on the supernatural rituals,BytesM,n/a,16/08/2025,"A thrilling global quest where skepticism meets dark magic. The Director was voluntarily cursed by global practitioners and witch doctors.This blurs the lines between belief, psychology, and the supernatural. Visually immersive, culturally rich, and unnervingly personal, it challenges reality's limits without easy answers. A haunting dive into the mind's powerSequel needed into a deeper darker element to it. Loved it.I loved how it covered different cultures and places and gave a global perspective on the dark world of magic and how despite miles apart that they all share similar characteristics which make you think there is a truth to the beliefs.",False
6,10,Thrilling Documentary!,rtcaldwell-282-988035,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone intrigued by the unknown but not superstitious, A Cursed Man was right up my alley. It's a great watch for both skeptics and believers. I would recommend this film to anyone who seeks to walk a little on the wild side for answers. What makes A Cursed Man stand out is its ability to walk the fine line between science and spirituality. The documentary doesn't just present eerie stories or unexplained phenomena, it actively explores the intersection of belief and reason. It invites the viewer to question whether we are all connected in ways we don't fully understand and what that might mean on a deeper, spiritual level. Liam, does an excellent job of leading the audience through his journey. His approach is neither overly skeptical nor blindly accepting; instead, he listens with an open mind, allowing the people he interviews to share their experiences and beliefs fully. Making it feel less like a one-sided argument and more like an exploration of possibilities.",False
7,10,A cursed watcher,robbierobin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was very disappointed in the movie as well as the thought that I spent money and time to see this.I kept waiting for something dramatic to happen. But the most dramatic incident was a scraped knee. Oh, the horror!His journey seemed to disprove curses while at the end he seemed semi-convinced. There's no climax. There's no build up. No exciting unexplainable activity like mysteriously moving objects, levitating, speaking in tongues. It's just a fall and him mentioning some bad dreams he's had.I love supernatural stuff-movies, documentaries, shows, but this was nothing but a let down.I can't account for the high reviews, unless it's family, friends, people that participated, and bots.",True
8,10,Is magic real? Let's explore this question.,chrisstierle,n/a,16/08/2025,"""A Cursed Man"" is a gripping documentary that completely drew me in-I genuinely couldn't look away.As someone who believes in both religion and magic, the film struck a deep chord. About halfway through, I felt a strange anxiety-as if I was standing at the threshold of truly understanding something profound. Liam, the host, guides you right up to that doorway, making the experience all the more intense.Even as the credits rolled, I couldn't stop watching. The music alone was hypnotic.The experts featured in the film offer compelling insights into the phenomenon at its core. And the ending? Unexpectedly powerful. It brings everything full circle with reflections from all the major figures involved, wrapping things up in a way that felt surprisingly moving and complete.Visually, the documentary is stunning-filled with rich depth-of-field shots, breathtaking drone footage, and sweeping overhead views of cities and sacred places. The cinematography is truly top-tier. The sound design is equally strong, and the score perfectly sets the film's emotional and spiritual tone.By the end, the story lands on a hopeful, deeply spiritual note of redemption-not just for Liam, but for all of us watching. You can feel it. A sense of grace, of connection, of reverence for the unseen.If you're religious, spiritual, or simply curious about the magic that lies just beyond the veil, this film is a powerful journey into the heart of the unknown. I highly recommend it.",False
9,1,This is an awful documentary,seanmckeown-85407,n/a,16/08/2025,"Firstly all the other reviews look like they were written by Ai. I have a strong feeling alot of the reviews and ratings are manipulated by the film maker or his cohorts. Because.. this documentary is a total waste of time, it is borderline one of the worst docs I've ever seen. The main guy has zero charisma and is painfully boring,he has zero personality. It would of been nice if he could of been cursed with one. Don't waste your time he doesn't even get a single bad curse in the entire show, everything is a knock off. They've paid tourist traps to do a private show. It's honestly so bloody awful, that the other reviews are blowing my mind.Please someone else watch it, so they can see just how terrible this show is.",False
10,10,A movie you didn't know you needed,imdbfan-7699286871,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a time where there's a division in the country, Liam Le Guillou's film does a compelling job displaying his artistry separating you from your own reality and sucking you into his reality. The cinematography was gorgeous with an edge to it. Documentaries aren't necessarily a genre for film watching I've grown up with, however, I've grown to genuinely appreciate and admire filmmakers, such as Liam, who carves a sculpture out of clay with films such as, A Cursed Man. I'd also like to add this documentary will do one of two things; intrigue you, creep you out, or both simultaneously. This was my first experience with the director and I am looking forward to seeing what else is in store!",False
11,3,Feels like a parody at times,JonnyJohnsonIII,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a hard watch. It had an interesting premise but the film on a whole was extremely bland. The dialogue is forced, the interviews are awkward, and the host has no personality. The only positive I can mention is that some of the cinematography was nice. I decided to rent this on Amazon prime for $5, and it feels like the only thing that was cursed was my wallet. Skip this one.I now have to fill an extra 300 characters for this review to publish so I am just going to list adjectives that describe this film: Boring, generic, cheesy, bland, uninteresting, drawn out, time wasting, unsatisfying, uninspired.",False
12,10,A dark journey,imdbfan-9813696492,n/a,16/08/2025,Liam delves into a dark place where I would not dare. This documentary is fascinating and thought provoking. Visually appealing and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This movie takes you on a journey around the world to places you will never wish to go. I got chills seeing some of the scenes of the rituals. As he walks into the cave in Mexico to make a pact with the devil it absolutely freaked me out. This is not something to play with and the fact that he did this deliberately is astounding but it does make for an exciting film. He should be so thankful that he got himself out from under the curses before it spiraled out of his control. Definitely worth a watch!,False
13,10,A JOURNEY INTO THE UNKNOWN,SinemR,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSomething I wish I could explore, but wouldn't dare to do myself. The director throws himself right into the unknown-he even asks to be 'cursed'!'A Cursed Man' is filmed in such a gripping way, it keeps you on your toes from start to finish. A very cinematic experience packed into a factual, experimental film that grips the audience- and it definitely delivers.Absolutely loved A Cursed Man-it's one of those films that stays with you. A clever concept, beautifully executed, and definitely worth watching more than once...""Nothing is predictable, because it's all about the unpredictable. You've got to watch this - especially if you're a sceptic!",True
14,10,A Cursed Man: Watch it if You Dare!,deogeegirl,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Cursed Man: Watch it if You Dare!No one can question Liam Le Guillou's pure commitment to his craft. He literally puts a target on his own back for the sake of storytelling. As an expert with 30 years in the New Age field, I can confidently say everything was 100% legit and pictured accurately. Liam clearly did his homework.I found myself watching at the edge of my seat, emotionally engaged and genuinely worried for his well-being. Visually beautiful-especially the city landscapes and the creative use of drones captures that supernatural feeling.This isn't just a documentary-it's an immersive experience that challenges the boundaries between investigation and personal risk.",False
15,10,A dark journey to meet the Devil himself!!!,bradleycharlesmeyer,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very entertaining journey that explores the dark side of magic. Takes you deeper and deeper into the darkness of black magic. Gave me chills more than once. I started off a skeptic but after watching Liam put himself in harms way like that and seeing the results is truly terrifying. Like the old saying goes don't invite the Devil to dinner, he just may show up! ""A Cursed Man"" is a very well produced film that's locations spanned the globe. It is an extremely entertaining documentary that will take you places you've never seen and maybe never dared to go. I highly recommend watching this documentary! Two big thumbs up!!",False
16,1,It had potential,LilL-511,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was genuinely interested in this topic and really looking forward to watching it. I enjoy learning about different spiritual practices and perspectives, especially ones that aren't often explored in mainstream media. That's why I rented this. I thought it would offer a fresh, thoughtful, maybe even eye-opening take on something meaningful. But honestly, it ended up being a huge disappointment.From the very start, it just felt flat. There was no real spark or energy. The pacing was painfully slow, and the way the story was structured didn't help at all. I kept waiting for it to pick up or offer some kind of deeper insight, but it just kind of dragged along. I wouldn't even call it a slow burn. It was just dull. And when you're covering a topic as layered as spirituality, that's saying something.The main person at the center of it all was supposed to carry the whole thing, but he had no charisma whatsoever. I hate to be harsh, but he was really hard to connect with. His delivery was so monotone and flat, and he didn't seem to bring any personality to what he was saying. I don't expect everyone to be a performer, but if you're the focus of a documentary, you need to at least hold the audience's attention. He just didn't. It felt like being talked at, not spoken to. There was no warmth, no emotion, and no sense of connection.I kept thinking it might get better. That maybe another voice would step in or it would build into something more powerful. But that never really happened. There were moments where it seemed like it was heading somewhere, but it never followed through. The film didn't have much of a point of view, and the storytelling was all over the place. For something that's meant to explore spiritual ideas, it didn't inspire anything at all. No new thoughts, no curiosity, and nothing that stayed with me afterwards.I was surprised to see how many good reviews this has. I even went back and checked them again to make sure I hadn't missed something. I know everyone connects with different things, but I honestly don't get the hype. This just didn't deliver. It barely scratched the surface of what could have been a fascinating subject, and I walked away from it feeling like I'd wasted my time.What made it worse was the price. I paid $5.99 to rent this, which is not a huge amount, but it still feels like a waste when the experience was this underwhelming. If it had been free, maybe I wouldn't feel so annoyed. But when you pay to watch something, you expect it to at least be engaging or thought-provoking. This wasn't either.Overall, the film could have been so much more. The topic deserved a deeper, more thoughtful approach. Instead, what we got felt unfinished, uninspired, and honestly, just boring. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, even if you're really into this kind of subject matter. There are so many better ways to explore these ideas.If you're curious about the topic, go find a podcast or read a book instead. Even a quick YouTube search would probably be more worthwhile. Just don't waste your $5.99 like I did. I wanted to enjoy this, and I really tried to stay open-minded. But in the end, it just didn't do the subject any justice.",False
17,10,Metaphysical or Psychosomatic?...,JTateNC,n/a,16/08/2025,"""A Cursed Man"" is a film that definitely draws you in with an eerie premise, ""If I wish for proof of demonic powers, will they manifest?"".A narrative that perfectly balances skepticism with an informed portrayal of unorthodox religious practices and paranormal studies. Accepting from the very beginning that any result could be psychosomatic without patronizing the possibility of metaphysical influences.The viewer is allowed unfettered to interpret the findings for themselves. But I will say this, the film definitely lingers in the mind. Make no mistake that An Unknown Compelling Force, whether it be internal or external, affects our lives in very tangible ways.",False
18,2,A 97-minute waste of your time,tmbrkr,n/a,16/08/2025,"As is typical with this type of documentary, there's really no pay off at the end. The reason for that is quite simple: this stuff simply does not exist. Imagine if it did. There'd be as many documentaries about demons and curses as there are about Hitler or 9/11. And by documentaries I mean serious documentaries, the stuff that HBO knock out now and again, not the rubbish you see on Discovery Plus or Really in the noughties. I'm looking at you, Ghost Adventures and Most Haunted.Still, I thought I'd give this one a shot in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, something out-of-the-ordinary and strange happens. Perhaps curses are real after all! Spoiler alert: nothing much happens, and curses aren't that real. I mean, stuff does happen, like sacrificing birds at an altar and brandishing a handwritten note to Satan whilst you beg for some medical misfortune in your life, but nothing happens that convinces me that any of this stuff is any more genuine than caught-on-camera poltergeist activity or having your prayers answered.I am in no doubt that the people featured in this documentary sincerely believe that what they are participating in is real. You'd really have to have that mindset to get on all fours and crawl around a cauldron like an idiot whilst shouting nonsense in the hopes of ridding someone of a recently acquired curse. But just because you think it's real and act like it's real doesn't actually make it real, a lesson that poor Liam learnt late-on when he flung himself off his bicycle and blamed his subsequently grazed knee on Lucifer. Got to wrap the documentary up somehow, eh?The cinematography and editing is actually very well done, which is why I have given it two stars. It's a shame about the subject matter, and the subject himself, who seems like a nice and decent bloke but has about as much screen presence and charisma as a wall of wet paint.",False
19,10,A Cursed Man (2023) - A Hauntingly Diverse Spiritual Journey,Rob_Dudley,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Cursed Man is an unsettling yet deeply compelling exploration of dark magic and spiritual transgression. The film immediately calls to mind Orson Welles' War of the Worlds, but unlike a radio hoax, the horror here is disturbingly real. On first viewing, it evokes a slow-building sense of dread, a lingering presence that stays with the viewer long after the film ends. There is a strange pull to it, an almost hypnotic effect that makes revisiting it feel inevitable.Liam Le Guillou's willingness to immerse himself in the unknown, even at personal risk, gives the documentary an air of sincerity that is both enthralling and disquieting. The film recalls the meditative yet unnerving tone of Werner Herzog's work, not just in its aesthetic choices but in its existential approach to storytelling. Beyond its chilling subject matter, A Cursed Man champions diversity and plurality, engaging with a wide range of spiritual traditions and belief systems. In doing so, it speaks to a broader cultural shift-a world spirit that is beginning to embrace contradiction, ambiguity, and the coexistence of multiple truths.Rather than offering conclusions, A Cursed Man opens a door. What lies beyond depends on who dares to step through.",False
20,4,more like a snipe hunt,litefoot-94753,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMore stars for concept, production values; less stars for execution, content authenticity. So let's say 4 overall.No epiphanies in this journey for the viewer. A lot of color, some insight, but at the end of the day we learn more about the psychological than the spiritual -- from general malaise into obsessive anxiety and then out again. I can't help thinking that if Le Guillou had spent more time in research (Joseph Campbell, Jung) the project would have been better served. Yes, there is more to our interactions with the physical world than we understand. But we knew that going in.1. Authentic documentaries tend toward the uneven. Highly dramatic driving music suggests viewer manipulation. Pitch perfect interviews suggestive of scripting and multiple takes don't help either -- this production is too well manicured for its own good. More detail on how the practitioners were selected (and how much they were paid) would be helpful. Noteworthy that no skeptics were consulted.2. Bad dreams and a mountain bike spill do not a curse make. How did Le Guillou come to be wearing a camera when the accident happened? Given the trail and speed filmed before, any accident would be no surprise. Also, absent any existing diagnosis, a negative screening for cancer is hardly a spell lifted.3. The practitioners tend to be more colorful and interesting than the professionals. Selected for their reputation and powers one question glares: if they are at the pinnacle of practice why are they not more upscale? (Other questions too: where do you get coffin nails in the 21st century?)4. Venturing to India is interesting enough to be an independent film. Hindu folklore and myth predate Creole Voodoo, American Wicca and Mexican Satanism. Interesting that Le Guillou's interaction with the dark practitioner here does not result in any curse but with feelings of strength and energy. What was his fee?5. Most viewers will question why not return to the source for lifting the two curses. The Wiccan reps are articulate and the ceremony seems well performed. Are we to conclude that Wicca trumps Voodoo and Satanism? Will be interesting to see how the Satanic Temple membership respond to Le Guillou's work. Maybe they should have been included.No intention here to question Le Guillou's sincerity and effort in A Cursed Man. The result is engrossing without being compelling. Throughout the film his declaration of uncertainty about what to believe echoes. I suspect many hover somewhere around that point.",True
21,4,Nothing happens.,amgillett-88113,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI can only think the 10/10 reviews of this are from people who fell asleep during the documentary. This is an awful documentary and adds nothing to the conversation of curses or 'magic'. Other than the guy having some bad dreams (probably because he spends loads of time hanging out with people who talk constantly about the devil) and falling off his bike, nothing happens that could even be remotely or tangentally connected to the 'curse' he 'endures'. As others have mentioned this feels like a parody most of time. I quite liked the LARP bits in the woods though.",True
22,3,Do NOT watch this,IvanS-108,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was so excited to see this movie, but now that I've watched it, I'm honestly just glad it wasn't any longer-thank God it's not a whole series. I really don't get how this has such a high rating, because it's so stupid. The main guy has zero charisma-he's not funny, not entertaining, just straight-up unwatchable. I gave it 3 stars only because I genuinely had a good laugh at how bad it was. My sister even shed a tear, not from emotion, but from how painfully boring it got. There's no sign of a single brain cell behind that guy's eyes. I actually love this kind of topic, but he didn't say or do anything remotely funny or interesting. All I can say is: don't watch this-even if you're bored. My sister and I just sat there like, what did we just watch? Honestly, even staring at a wall would've been a better use of time.",False

We see a happy mother, playing with her child in a small garden (near a heavily polluting freeway), living in a caravan / trailer. THIS is not paradise as most Americans would see it. But it was to this mother.

Had it been an interstate stub that needs to avoide swings and bends they wouldve done it in promptu...we are talking about 20000000 americans that lives in a house on rented and nobody cares, its outragous, so go scavagehunting before you get 20000000 million more homeless drifting your countryside like guring the great depression.Im an angry grumpy old man that smell the evils of capitalism and loves the scent of socialism in these kind of settings, do enforce an affordable rent act before its too late...this is a great and humble try via documentarymaking to show the universal destruction of lower middle class and the ''upper ''poor class of the united states population, watch it and engage yourself to it. Most of all they pay their taxes to your community, which the rich dont cause they can afford to sneak around the taxation system.So thank you sara terry and victoria chalk for bringing this out to the world wide silverscreenmarket.",False

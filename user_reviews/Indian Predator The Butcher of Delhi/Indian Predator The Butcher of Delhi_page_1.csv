1,6,"Interesting crime, perhaps not told in the best possible way.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"A three part series detailing the gruesome murders of Chandrakant Jha, The Butcher of Delhi.I was really looking forward to this series, it really is a fascinating, gruesome case. A killer, who got away with his crimes for a long time.Overall, it's a pretty satisfying watch, you learn about the killer, his motives, his loathing of The Police, and it's a great looking show, the re-enactments look pretty good.It's worth watching to learn about the shocking crimes, definitely the stuff of nightmares.However, it's a very frustrating watch, it's literally like trying to herd cats, as there are so many strands, so much information is delivered, but it jumps about in the most frustrating way, you will definitely need extra caffeine if you're planning to binge watch it, as it can be a little hard to keep up.The running order for the series is maybe a little questionable, you get the crimes and learn who in episode one, then you get the backstory in parts two and three, I'm not fully sure that worked.It's pretty good, but could have been so much better, 6/10.",False
2,6,Ok series but fades away as you watch..,rohanarora-24920,n/a,16/08/2025,Honestly i am a big serial killer story fan have watched all Netflix docs about crime.and was very excited to see an Indian serial killer docuseries!!So i watched first episode i would rate it 9/10 but after the first both 2 and 3 are utterly boring like super boring they could have made it one 2 hour documentary and i think it would have been a pretty good job. The way of story telling have been it's like losing interest as you keep watching after first episode.The screenplay is too much horror type comparing to something like Mind Hunter which is made not to make you feel sick even if the murders are brutal but this show they made it look very horrified.Production was good not like some indie series.overall it's ok.,False
3,5,Vapid and Unstructured.,abhishekkulranjanrao,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had high expectations from this one. Throughout the series, I felt as if I am being thrown from one storyline to another, as a result, I could not connect with the series. Alas! A golden opportunity to present a ""desi serial killer"" in an engaging manner goes down the drain.Although the cinematic aesthetics are done quite well.",False
4,6,Not a documentary of murder mystery,nyatishubham,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerIf you are looking for documentary on the murder mystery then this will let you down..the killer is itself caught in first episode what followed is the ordeals of his crime and his psychology. Nothing surprise element except for some chillng photos of victims clicked by killer and details of gore.,True
5,6,"An interesting case, but series fails on keeping your attention",cassandra-petersen,n/a,16/08/2025,"This could have been a great series. The case itself is very interesting. Unfortunately it was poorly executed in a documentary series. It seems to trail off in the first part of the second episode.Many are commenting/blaming Indias Justice system and policing for their low rating score - placing biase and cultural difference aside, regardless of a case like this, we have to be mindful and remember there are ""failures"" of justice in any part of the world; the ones in which we live are not superior. Every justice system is in a never ending journey of evolving and growing as our world changes.",False
6,6,An okayish start to the Indian serial killer universe! [+56%],arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix ultimately brings the serial killer craze to India's capital with a somewhat lesser known case of a man targeting the police and judicial systems with a string of murders. This three-part documentary expounds his brutal deeds, while subtly (and effectively) showcasing the oversight of the Delhi police in deciphering and catching the perpetrator. The larger chunk of essential information lies in the first couple of episodes, while the third serves as a filler-piece except for the portion where the family members of a victim are interviewed.But when you look at the work as a whole, while I appreciate Ayesha Sood's hard-boiled approach, it lacks the memorability. The evidences presented are scarce, and since we don't get to hear any insights from the criminal himself (except for already-published, short TV interviews) or his immediate family, it is difficult to objectively read the guy. Some of his victims are barely even mentioned to add to his menacing mystique. At an overall viewing duration of 2 hours, it's always worth catching if true crime interests you!",False
7,7,Annoying English Subtitling,rwthdrnh,n/a,16/08/2025,It is so annoying that the subtitles do not match what people are saying. This guy is speaking English and the subtitles when he speaks are incorrect. Otherwise fairly interesting and entertaining documentary.,False
8,4,Fails to hold your interest,xdwzp,n/a,16/08/2025,The narration sequence and style don't do justice to the nature of the crimes. Several events shown in the movie are staged with actors. The commentary from the police officers and criminologist is boring and matter-of-fact. I couldn't wait for the last episode to end so I can move on to something more interesting.,False
9,n/a,Inchorent storytelling and poor Direction,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seems like made by bunch of amateurs. The source material is so rich, there are so much to explore in this subject. And the final outcome is just so disappointing.",False
10,6,Bit Stretched,rahul-rightnow,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's good to see that Netflix is trying to fill some good documentary in Indian true crime space, and this documentary is good but it could have ended in just an hour. I felt it a bit Stretched.",False
11,1,A load of boastful incompetence,Valid_ID,n/a,16/08/2025,"This so-called documentary attracts attention only because of the gory details of the murders committed. The whole story has nothing smart or interesting about it. It's fairly straight forward, but the producers stretch it to a great length, milking it for all it's worth. There are no discoveries due to logical assessment, and the police has little merit in catching the killer. Sure they try to analyze the writing in the letters the murderer sends, and they get a psychological profile, all for naught.In the end, an informant told the police exactly who the murderer was, and despite that, it took the police quite awhile to actually arrest him because they were completely incompetent and lazy: they would get bored staking a place, and quit before the suspect would show up. After they finally caught him, the killer made a full confession, so all the police had to do was to check if what they were told was true. They found the remains of the victims where the killer said they would be. Again, the policemen interviewed in this documentary make a great deal of their findings, when in reality they just followed the lead, and did their job - not soon enough though.This documentary consists of nothing but an overstretched series of interviews, mainly with the police boasting for no reason. For example, one of them says ""I had the idea of checking the remains for DNA"". Checking for DNA shouldn't be a spontaneous idea, it should be basic procedure. Another policeman proves completely incompetent when he notices the suspect's car right in front of him, and he calls his boss to ask what to do.And the fact that for the longest time the police actually refused to consider a serial killer despite the obvious and shocking pattern of the murders is another obvious proof of their incompetency and laziness.Bottom line, I found absolutely nothing worth learning by watching this documentary. A complete waste of time!",False
12,8,A Largely Corrupt Police Force That Prays on The Poor,saysjenn,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary is not just about the Butcher of Delhi but also the corruption with police and attitudes towards the poor. The police in India seem to lack resources and are understaffed so they cherry pick cases. The poorest people get the least protection and some police are actually predatory towards them by forcing bribes to simply exist without harassment. So there is a lot of corruption.The police in this case seemed to have good intentions but I think they are understaffed. They don't have time to dig into a case so they move on to easier cases. The biggest demonstration of this was when they had the name of a victim tattooed on their arm yet they couldn't identify the body. Pretty pathetic police work. They also only keep unidentified bodies for 72 hours. This all seems like the perfect storm for a clever serial killer to settle into an area that is largely ignored and marginalized. If the killer wasn't so sloppy and obnoxious he probably could have stayed undetected.,False
13,6,This should have been a 6-8 episode crime drama,iGlad,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was crying out to be a crime drama as it had so much going for it. Incompetent police, devious and taunting murderer and a mystified press.The reasons why he killed and how he started out are quite fascinating.",False
14,2,2 stars only for shining light into this story,anniehuynh-53195,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe case is interesting in itself but the way it was depicted and narrated in this series is just blatantly biased and non-coherent.Not once was the question raised if the police just failed in their job, not once did they ponder, if the corrupted in the police force are linked on how low the crime solving rate is, esp. Amongst victims belonging to a certain diaspora. Instead, unqualified statements about how migrant workers have mental issues and if that might contribute to them becoming murderers and especially furious: the statement of the esteemed forensic scientist lady, who pondered that the murderer must have ""inherited some genes from his parents making him prone to being a murderer"". This is a sentence totally taken out of context and perpetualising the idea in some crime series, that there is in fact, something like a ""murderer / serial killer gene"". They are probably talking about the MAOA gene which MIGHT have something to do with aggression - but is also linked to cancer, Alzheimer, ADHD and several other diseases.",True
15,7,Great Watch,rbeck-25263,n/a,16/08/2025,Great watch. Not only the investigation of the serial killing but a view of life and poverty within Delhi. Plus the impact on the locals and their families. Really well done and different take to the serial killer documentary.,False
16,7,DONT TRUST ANYONE.,swimonna,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe killer's self-confidence in the first episodes is entirely based on his past killing experience. But he was tried for only 9 crimes, but it is thought that 44 people were killed, I definitely think there are more than 44 people. Although he grew up in a beautiful family, he became obsessed with himself and corrupted his mind. And he just got relief by killing other people. Taking pictures of victims was certainly one of the typical acts of a serial killer. Also, the most interesting part of the story was that all the village people knew about it and didn't say a word about it.",True
17,7,Its good but could have been better,suyashchandraanything,n/a,16/08/2025,After a long time Netflix delivers a good content. The most unique thing about this series is that it shows us the detailed psychology of a serial killer which is something rare. But as I said its good but could have been better.The 1st episode was fabulous and mindblowing. But from 2nd episode the story started to lose its momentum and the 3rd episode became a drag and repetitive.The subject is very rare and could have been presented in a better manner. This story had a potential to be a massive success but it couldn't be.,False
18,7,Kudos for the effort of the makers,atharvalotlikar,n/a,16/08/2025,"This shall be compared to House Of Secrets a lot.However this documentary mini series is worth watching. Also, the cinematography and casting has been exemplary.Overall a stomach churning watch.E3's pacing is a little slow and E1 is the best of this series.",False
19,4,Below Average,mohdzinna,n/a,16/08/2025,Plot of the story is good but stretched tooo much and bad direction. This could have been a better outcome if it were shown with some more data. Only letter is evidence and nothing.,False
20,7,Dark yet intriguing!!!,sanjubhat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Web series review: Indian Predator - The Butcher of Delhi streaming on Netflix
#sanjuzzreviews #netflixindia #netflixseries #indianpredatorthebutcherofdelhi #docuseries #truecrime
This 3 part docuseries chronicles the life of a brutal Indian Serial Killer who challenged the entire law and order system, especially the Delhi Police Force in 2006, as he killed with impunity and brazenly left the decapitated bodies outside the high security Tihar Jail.With very few leads to follow up on , this series is a tribute to the bravehearts of the police force, who solved this extremely complicated case using every possible resource available at their disposal.The series also takes a deep dive into the twisted mind of the serial killer who is a shrewd & intelligent individual with a high IQ. One who kept committing and getting away with brutal crimes for such a long time.Were the crimes he was convicted of, the only ones he had committed or are there more bodies lying someplace, yet to be unearthed ... Your guess is as good as mine!!Not for the faint hearted, dark yet intriguing!!3/5 from me .. adios 🙂!!",False
21,4,The killer is right!,deacon_blues-88632,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWatching this documentary, it's obvious that the killer is absolutely right about the stupidity and incompetence of the Delhi police. They couldn't identify the bodies because they had no heads, even though the person's name was inscribed on the victim's arm! If you're in India, don't expect the police to be of any use at all in solving a crime or protecting citizens. Tragic and sad.",True
22,10,Indian predator:the butcher of delhi-season 1,puranjanbasak,n/a,16/08/2025,"Indian predator:the butcher of delhi is a documentary crime history series directed by ayesha sood.It is one of the most captivating and brutal documentaries in the indian documentary space. It has been handled by ayesha sood with utmost precision not feeding boredom to the audience. It is engaging throughout specially the first two episodes i felt. The crime is hideous, the psych behind it more vicious. This show has the ability to chill out your bones with its dialogues enhanced by an all impressive bgm. The sound design is impeccable and stifle. The acted scenes of violence and killings is brilliantly done.It talks a lot about the societal and cultural problems. The killer not being attended by his parents talks a lot about his conditioning and mental space. It also talks about police incompetency and false cases.Finally, the actor altaf hussain who acts as the killer needs to be praised highly. What stares, what exoressive eyes. He has nailed it in his sequences.This is a must watch documentary. Netflix may have some bad shows on netflix india but its docu-series are outstanding. I rate it 10.",False
23,7,Holds a lot of Significance,SoumikBanerjee1996,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The deviant and the conformist are creatures of the same culture, inventions of the same imagination"" - Kai Theodor EriksonFor me, Criminology has always been a topic of fascination and interest. To discern, to make any estimations on what might have gone in their heads while committing such heinous acts, it's enthralling to say the very least. Thus, I'm constantly on the lookout for these Crime Documentaries, that not only shed light on the crime and the process of investigative protocols followed, but it also evaluates the darker sections of our society that often faces negligence and gets mistreatment.""Indian Predator - the Butcher of Delhi,"" tells the story of a psychopathic individual who befriended and subsequently assassinated & dismembered at least 8 victims. Divided into three separate episodes, the narrative here ingeniously demonstrated three different parts of the case. Whilst, the first two episodes largely focus on the facts and figures of the said investigation and the eventual detention of the wrongdoer, The last one leaned more toward the societal pertinence of the perpetrator and imposes a few critical questions.The concluding minutes of the show signifies the very notion of an appropriate upbringing and social conditioning of a child. That is not only an essential factor to nourish & nurture a gullible intellect, but it also sets a significant example for others to follow in their footsteps.",False

25,7,Quality production by VICE Media,Erik_Surewaard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just leave it to VICE if you want a great documentary. I honestly hope we will see more VICE content on Netflix in the future.The only thing that could have been better is the dubbing, I like it that they used people from India to dub the english language version, but better care should be taken to have the spoken language agree the movement of the mouth...",False

1,7,A good documentary on a great filmmaker's most personal film to date,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,15/08/2025,"So Roma might well be the most auteur film of all time then?This well-done documentary would certainly support such a claim.It's all about what they did and how they did it, and I was a little frustrated about the lack of discussion on why. Cuaron is kinda like ""yeah I couldn't have shot it in anything but black and white"" but doesn't elaborate any further. And why exactly they needed the set to smell like how he remembered his house smelling I dunno.BUT: he did it, and I suppose that's impressive.
Impressive enough for some people to call Roma one of the greatest films in recent memory. I'm not quite in that camp, but it's undeniably a great achievement, and this documentary helps show in detail just how much work truly went into it.",False

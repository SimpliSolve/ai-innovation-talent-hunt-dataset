1,4,A documentary that lacks in-depth information...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stumbling upon this 2022 documentary titled ""Back to Chernobyl"" in 2022, I must admit that I was expecting a bit more than what writers Yuval Haimovich-Zuser and Simon Shechter managed to deliver here at the hands of director Roman Shumunov.Given the nature of the Chernobyl disaster and the impact it had on the USSR and most of Europe, then this is something that we cannot ignore and have to learn from. And with so many years having passed already, I have to admit that I expected ""Back to Chernobyl"" to be a bit more informative than what it turned out to be.""Back to Chernobyl"" didn't really bring much of any new information to the table. Sure, it showcased some archive footage and some interviews with a handful of people, but I have to say that once the 52 minutes of run time ended, I sat with a 'was that really it?' sensation. So yeah, I can't claim that this 2022 documentary was particularly impressive, much less overly informative.Sure, ""Back to Chernobyl"" can be used as a supplementary documentary to the many other more in-depth documentaries that exist. But as a stand-alone documentary, then director Roman Shumunov just didn't really make this a memorable documentary.My rating of ""Back to Chernobyl"" lands on a four out of ten stars.",False

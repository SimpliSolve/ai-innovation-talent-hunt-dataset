1,3,Not so funny Paul Merton,chrisjohngay,n/a,16/08/2025,Really disappointed with this series.Paul trying to be funny but comes across as just a bit of a old bore tbh.Only continued to watch for the lovely scenery of the Lake District.Really could have been so much better with another couple. My wife and I would have been more entertaining.,False
2,10,I think he's awkward too.,mrf-20337,n/a,16/08/2025,"But that isn't the point. I really liked Paul's early work, but over the years been disappointed by his decline in apparent enthusiasm on HIGNFY especially. At least in this, there is no pretence. He is awkward putting his real self on display and a complete amateur at motorhoming and presenting. Personally I'm fed up of perfection and polish. This is his chance to show us how he can embrace new things and improve. Suki as well is far from the finished article, but she is genuine, as is their obvious loving bond. Good luck to them. I for one want a second series as much for them as for anyone else. Doesn't have to be in a motorhome. Of course 10 stars is too high, but as the other reviews are too low, I'm happy to balance them out. Good luck to them.",False
3,3,Yawn!,pbk-21799,n/a,16/08/2025,"So called ""celebrities"" doing short breaks in cars, caravans, boats, motor homes are being done to death. This one is worth watching for the destinations only. Paul Merton is far from funny, has a very awkward presenting style and is out of his depth. He comes across like an infirm old man at times and it's cringe worthy seeing him try to make funnies but failing. Suki at least, tries her best but she doesn't have it to rescue this dead duck of a series and I hope it's not given another.",False
4,9,Really enjoyed this show,wayneshendry,n/a,16/08/2025,Nice to see a couple that seemed ordinary (like us ha) but have a nine way with the people on camera. Really enjoyed the TV show and look forward to another.,False
5,4,Very cringe worthy couple,jamiebawn,n/a,16/08/2025,What happened to Paul Merton? He was funny on HIGNFY. This is cringe worthy stuff. It's like he's with his mum the kind of way he is acting. She's not funny either but is slightly more likeable. I watched the first season for the scenery and for humour. Any humour is like really crap dad jokes. They try and fail miserably. Why they were allowed to do a second series beats me. They were just as cringe worthy on that too.Watch it for the scenery. However I recommend muting it or play it round your granny's house as anyone under the age of 70 will find this dull with boring unfunny presenters who should never be allowed to work together on TV again.,False
6,1,Turned off,seshaw-74891,n/a,16/08/2025,"Inane drivel. I've always thought Paul Merton was funny, not so much in this. As for his wife. She seems very nice, but very boring. We didn't make it all the way through, despite a few attempts!",False
7,8,Interesting and informative,johnwtunnicliffe,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cannot fathom out why people are giving this show such low ratings. It is a pleasant, informative show and quite inspiring. It does what it is supposed to do with gentle humour. I would prefer more hints and how to motorhome but I don't think many people would appreciate a hour and a half plus programme. I don't watch it for the comedy element, though both Suki and Paul are funny, it's just an hour isn't long enough and I would rather have facts than humorous little acts. Would I love more series's? Yes of course I would. I just want to own a motorhome and go around the UK and the rest of the world!",False
8,4,...Next!,christaylorcoe,n/a,16/08/2025,"This has to be one of the most boring celeb couple documentaries ever made. Merton should be embarrassed to put his name it, tedious in the extreme. Literally nothing happens, no interesting places visited, no exciting funny moments, no laughs between them. Small talk that makes you squirm and
Just want turn over, which I did.Gave it 4, out of sympathy. Should be a ZERO!",False
9,1,Shocking ..sickly ....,sbraisdell-60172,n/a,16/08/2025,Enjoy motorhomes ...turned off ..quite clearly not presenters or personalities ...,False
10,3,Boring comedian couple go on trips in a motorhome with boring consequences,srsmith73,n/a,16/08/2025,"How this was commissioned for a second series is beyond me.Paul and his comedian ( ????????? ) wife travel around the UK in a motorhome. You don't really get to see much of the UK and it all seems a bit fake and uncomfortable at points when they are chatting to other people.Paul is not engaging and comes across as lazy and just can't be bothered when trying to do simple tasks and the running theme in the first series of what to call their motorhome is childish and unfunny. Suki seems nice, but is equally as boring.Surely there must be a famous couple who actually likes motorhoming or camping who would be more engaging.I can only think that Paul has got something really bad on the person who commissioned this and is blackmailing them somehow to force them to put this on the telly. It's absolutely tedious.",False

1,9,Keep a box of kleenex handy,pikapix58,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not going to say much about this great dive into a Canadian icon, other than it stirred up a lot of memories from my childhood, and that I was balling my eyes towards the end of it. Also mild spoiler, for those of you who grew up watching both Mr. Dressup and Mr. Rogers, you'll be delighted to know that not only were they friends but Mr. Rogers was the best man at Mr. Dressup's wedding. It doesn't get any more wholesome than that. You'll also be relieved to know that Ernie Coombs was pretty much Mr. Dressup off camera as well. If you haven't seen it yet, get off this site and watch it immediately.",False
2,8,Fans of Mr. Dress-Up will love it,heidi-96436,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this walk through memory lane about one of my childhood heroes at a recent screening at TIFF. It was fun learning about Mr. Dress-Up's (Ernie Coombs) early career and his friendship with Fred Rogers and all of the behind the scenes info. While it didn't tug at my heartstrings as it did others ( I am a bit of a heart nut to crack), his story will likely touch all of those in Canada that loved him so dearly. We lost a Canadian legend far too soon!If you didn't get to see it on the big screen as I did, I would recommend that you check it out when it comes to Amazon Prime on October 10th.",False
3,9,Brought Back Memories,DVK1234,n/a,15/08/2025,"I remember watching Mr Dress Up as a kid. Interesting, I didn't know Ernie Coombs was American and that he knew Fred Rogers, and they were good friends. I must admit, I always liked Ernie Coombs; his kindness was apparent even through the television. I didn't particularly love the show Mr Dress Up, although I remember being impressed by his ability to draw. I found the show boring, and preferred the likes of Sesame Street and Electric Company, even Friendly Giant over this show.Having said that, this documentary confirms what a kind, decent man Ernie Coombs was. I cried through the last part of the film. How tragic was his wife's death. They seemed so in love. And in spite of this, he did not cancel his scheduled appearance on Fred Penner's show two week's after her death, an episode that features Fred Penner and Ernie Coombs singing a very beautiful and moving song together.It was also so heartbreaking to discover how Ernie Coombs died. It happened right around 9/11, and his son found his way back to Canada from the UK by securing a coveted flight because he told the airline that he was the son of Mr Dress Up, who was in hospital and his dad was probably not going to make it. At that point I was bawling my eyes out.A beautiful documentary film about a Canadian icon. I am so glad I stumbled upon this movie and I recommend!!!",False
4,10,Thank You Mr. Dressup,popnfresh_16,n/a,15/08/2025,"An absolute trip down memory lane. You'll laugh, you'll smile, you'll cry. Mr. Dressup will forever be in the hearts of Canadians. When I started watching back in the late 80's early 90's I never missed an episode. I don't remember Casey and Finnegan as much, as they were phased out around the time my memory started to develop more. But I absolutely loved Truffles and Chester. Unfortunately I never got the opportunity to see or meet Mr. Dressup myself, but his affect and impact on myself and many other will be felt until our final days. On behalf of Canada, we will always love you Mr. Dressup, we miss you dearly.",False
5,10,A love letter to a Canadian icon,jreade-64740,n/a,15/08/2025,"Every kid in Canada knew Mr. Dressup when I was growing up, even the older ones. It was a common bond for all of us, something uniquely Canadian. No matter what part of Canada you came from, or if your family moved here as a kid, you watched him. This documentary shows that his magic is timeless, and his impact on pop culture was never forgotten.Rob McCallum does a great job reminding us all that growing up, but still maintaining the spark of a child's imagination is very much possible (and required to stay sane). The home movies show that even away from the set, Ernie Coombs was the same kind, caring and fun loving person. Mr. Dressup may be off the air, but his magic will live on in the hearts of every kid that puts on a cape, makes something from cardboard tubes or draws for the fun of it.",False
6,10,beautifully done tribute,marlealyons,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a lovely film. I was crying through the whole ending. I have such fond memories of Mr Dressup, Casey and Finnigan. We lived in a chaotic household, Watching Mr. Dressup, gave me that precious time to just be a child. The amount of love that his family had for him is so apparent. His children and grand children are beautiful people. He was not just an entertainer, he was an incredibly strong man and a consummate person. He lives in the hearts of so many Canadians and we need that wonderful, calm, loving, and most of all kindness in our lives in our world right now.The film is beautifully done. You won't be disappointed.",False
7,10,A magical tribute to a Canadian icon,aucoinink,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw this at the Calgary International Film Festival and it touched me in a way I never expected. The full force of the impact Mr. Dressup had on me and millions of others hit me hard in the feels. Seeing his friendly face on the big screen after 30 years took me right back to my childhood and made me realize he's kind of a hero to me. This is a documentary that should've been made years ago, but it's never too late. The director handled the subject matter with the same warmth and love that Ernie ""Mr Dressup"" Coombs himself lived his life.There wasn't a dry eye in the theater. Highly recommended.",False

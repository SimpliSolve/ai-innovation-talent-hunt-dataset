1,6,"A mashup of other ""Dark Side of the Ring"" Vice episodes and don't cover much new ground",michiganave_p,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was looking forward to this being a deep dive of all of the controversial business decisions Vince made through the decades of his leadership, but instead, it is just mashups of the most watched ""Dark Side of the Ring"" episodes where Vince is heavily involved.I know Vice's team did this to cut down on the production and writing expenses, but in the end, it's not a very good documentary by any stretch of the imagination.There was a lot of controversy to cover with Vince, but again, they limited the scope severely, specifically how bad he treated the talent that is retired and remaining, let alone the ones he threw away and ending up dying tragic deaths.The ending was okay with regards to how he cashed out with the WWE IPO, but then it opened him up to discovery on all of his sexual misconduct hush payments made through the company. That part was okay, even though the documentary didn't really explain that his family is still in charge of the thing with him ""no longer"" there, or out of active management supposedly.It also feels like this documentary and the ""Dark Side of the Ring"" series is here just to rebuke A&E's ""Biography: WWE Legends"" WWE-produced fluff series, but it doesn't do the greatest job of that even. Still, I watched this and the series, so it was good enough for me but nothing I would want to rewatch.",False
2,n/a,Garbage,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This turned out to be exactly what I thought it would be, lies, half truths and omission of important facts to sensationalize the story of Vince. This is nothing more than a way to attack Vince and try to frame Vince McMahon as the one responsible for the actions of those around him. I can't defend everything he's done but it's not hard to tell this isn't 100% fact, probably less than 50% of it is. This is entertaining and I'm sure the Vince haters will love it, but it's not a true story. It seems like all they did was try to interview the people they knew would say what they needed them to say to get the story they wanted to tell. It's the same old stuff disgusting companies like Vice love to make.",False

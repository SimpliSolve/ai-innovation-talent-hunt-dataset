1,6,Well Made But...,kskmah,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's very convincing, but most of the incidents sounds like dreams. Some have physical proof so that is ok but not really enough to prove aliens. The questions are why are these advanced aliens even bothering abduction humans and animals. And constantly doing it? Pick up a book or watch a video and you have everything you want to know about the human or animal body. Also about the aliens visiting kids and telling them the message of not harming the world and each other? So if aliens came and told me this, I would spend my rest of my life to hella make sure to do this or to continue their messages. But guess what? Not one of those kids ever did that? I would of started a club or group and only dedicate ourselves for this cause.",True
2,3,"Good intentions, bad references",SBenoit5,n/a,16/08/2025,"The initiator of this documentary in my opinion has really lived an extraterrestrial experience. Unfortunately, he soon found himself in a very bad environment... And he has largely built his documentary with members of this dubious environment.First, he chose to put all his trust in Strieber, who in my opinion is a fraud, a writer stuck with writer's block who saw in this growing phenomenon of alien abduction an almost inexhaustible source of inspiration.In the group of people around him, in my opinion there are only 2 ladies who seem to me to have had real experiences... the others not... just cookoos looking for a way to feel special.You must remember that just because the phenomenon has a real basis, it does not mean that everyone who comes forward is an authentic ""experiencer"".One can often rely on the fact that true experiencers suffer from PTSD most of the time. Because going through this is deeply traumatic. The Striebers and friends hardly manage to ""talk"" about it without laughing... That was my 2 cents.",False
3,3,Misleading rubbish,sc_mackinnon,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe trailer leads you to believe that governments have finally leaked substantial documents that detail all that they know of alien visitations. Nope!This was a major disappointment. It's nothing but hippy-dippy-crystal-gripping New Age nonsense mixed with aspects of Christianity -- with aliens replacing God!Utter tripe. Don't waste your time.,True
4,10,New Must See Contact Experiences Told 1st Hand From 9 Experiencers,jjander-87268,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have rewatched this so many times; each time I learn more. Nine never before seen contact experiences are revealed first hand with gripping re-enactments. Whitley Strieber provides historical context and insights into phenomena that have likely been with us since our inception. John Yost breaks through personal fears and faces a paradigm shifting reality. Who are they, who are we? This topic is a rabbit hole, but this film lays a foundation for understanding, if you are ready.",False
5,10,Highly Recommend,sontagclaire,n/a,16/08/2025,I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in spirituality as well as aliens. It has a very moving message that humanity needs to hear! Very moving.,False
6,10,Brave people sharing their experiences.,majllc,n/a,16/08/2025,"These genuine people from all different walks of life share their deeply personal and varied experiences. If you are expecting a hair-raising thriller, you are in the wrong place. This documentary is utterly relatable, and a humble attempt to explain the universal phenomena that humankind has been experiencing since the beginning of recorded history. Bringing these people together and threading their experiences into this cohesive documentary is commendable. While it is not blockbuster entertainment, the information imparted is valuable and authentic. If you are sincere in your belief that there is greater intelligence in our universe, you will appreciate this documentary.",False
7,10,"Fascinating, Informative, And Moving",samueltourville,n/a,16/08/2025,"John Yost has put together an honest, emotional, and mind blowing documentary on what it's really like to experience an alien abduction, or a lifetime of abductions, without the wild fiction and sensationalism that Hollywood always seem to throw in. John and the other abductees share their experiences honestly and openly, answering many questions while instilling a desire to dig even deeper. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the extraterrestrial phenomenon.",False
8,9,It's a well made documentary,mjones41-826-630736,n/a,16/08/2025,"You're never going to take someone from complete skeptic to believer in 1 and a half hours of television. Having said that if you're already interested and made some attempt to research the phenomena then this is going to ring very true. If you are coming at it stone cold this is a good jumping off point. Reading or listening to Whitley's book communion is a good second step. There is so much more to the Alien story than UAP's (flying saucers). Listening to experiencers is how you really start to get a picture of what is going on. Of course this documentary and no single person is going to give you all the answers, because ultimately we are talking about the meaning of life, and how we all come to be here. Good luck everyone :)",False

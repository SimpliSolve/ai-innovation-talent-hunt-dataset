1,8,A documentary with a real rawness,veganluke,n/a,16/08/2025,"Charli XCX is one of my favourite artists and it's amazing to see behind the scenes of her making her album ""How I'm Feeling Now"" during lockdown. It's also a documentary that shows she really cares about her fans. Instead of having this filmed with a big camera crew, it's just Charli and two other people filming on handy cams. It gives a real rawness to it and I think that's what made this work so well.",False

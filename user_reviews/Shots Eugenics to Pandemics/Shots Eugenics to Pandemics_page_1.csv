1,8,JUST THE FACTS,denisenalex,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary outlines every single fact from start to finish. The exact facts that anyone who wss paying attention with at least 2 brain cells and able to form independent thought ALREADY KNEW. Either through the truth that would come out at first only to shortly after be charged and censored because it didn't fit the political agendas or through good old common sense.This documentary contains the ACTUAL interviews, news articles, data, statistics, press releases, guidelines and ALL THE NARRATIVE shifts that followed. 100% irrefutable facts. And probably the BEST PART is it's produced by the progressive LEFT PRESS. Democrats have been the biggest pushers, liars and deniers about what's been really going on here so seeing ALL PEOPLE WAKE UP is a beautiful thing.Anyone who can DENY any part of this with a straight face is part of the problem.READING and doing research instead of just doing what they've been told could have saved countless lives.",False
2,10,People rating 1 star are too scared to believe it's all true,clsmith-62288,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very well documented information and no it's not all full of anti-vaxxer conspiracies. The term anti-vaxxer is a lazy and scared persons way of denying validity to the notion that we aren't all in a world of sunshine and rainbows while the most heavily fined company on earth (pfizer) for fraud is pumping an experimental concoction into every man, woman, and child. It's terrifying to think the level of depravity in the men and women forcing this on us can exist, but as the documentary shows it's nothing new and the idea of slowing the births and getting rid of the fluff in society has been a goal for well over a century. Spoiler, the Spanish Flu wasn't from Spain, it was an offshoot of a vaccination program forced into all the soldiers before the outbreak. Sounds so familiar as we force our modern soldiers to take a harmful and useless vaccine that spawned Omicron, that are causing harm, that have hushed side effects, and have resulted in every medical professional being warned their career will end if they speak badly of the vaccine. It's all happened before as this documentary clearly shows and after watching it you'll never see this farce of Covid 19 and it's therapy the same way again.",False
3,1,Absolute Trash,leech-76115,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA ""documentary"" that leverages past atrocities in order to lie about COVID vaccines. This ""documentary"" provides no evidence, no data and nothing of substance.The first section of the movie is a poor description of Nazi eugenics and medical testing. While this is by and large accurate, it is poorly presented and done much better in other documentaries and podcasts.The other section is fear mongering on vaccines, focusing on COVID-19 vaccines. Lying about the efficacy and dangers of the vaccine to spark fear in people without showing any actual science or evidence supporting any claims made.The only value you could get from watching this would be to better understand the people driving anti-vaccine beliefs online and making money off these anti-vaccination beliefs. Other than that, there is no reason to waste two and a half (!!!!) hours of your time.",True
4,10,Worth the Watch,dylanchapin,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is definitely worth watching. But I really did not like the random music quotes. It was strange. The documentary provider legitimate insight into some of the things surrounding Covid, the CDC, and any the role government played. It was well produced but the random music quotes were uncomfortable and peculiar. Is the documentary promoting some strange band? It seems so. But anyway, the documentary is worth watching. Good sources and legitimate information. Thank you for producing this documentary with such detail. I had 2 vaccinations and 1 booster but was still sick both times u had Covid.",False
5,1,"I tried, I really did.",dylanpatterson1987,n/a,15/08/2025,"I gave this movie a chance, even though the title itself gives away it's ridiculousness. It makes a lot of ""points"" that would be major ""A-HA!"" moments, if you take a very narrow view of the situation, like this movie does. It uses all of the ""tricks"" in the conspiracists playbook to try to make you believe that vaccines, you know the things that have scientific data supporting their efficacy, are merely a tool built by the early American elites to help thin the American minorities and disabled. This is a cute, nefarious idea that gives YouTube ""researchers"" a really cogent boogeyman to blame all of life's problems on but honestly this movie is laughable to anyone capable of rational thought. I have it 1/10 simply because zero isn't an option. This movie is actively trying to spread scientific disinformation. It's harmful, and reckless. If you want a movie to actively make you dumber, congratulations, you've come to the right place.",False
6,10,A doc of facts that I was easily able to verify,aktu-41107,n/a,15/08/2025,"The history of Eugenics is already well known and is covered well. Getting in to Pandemics and vaccines has not been so well documented. This documentary brought forth facts I was able to easily verify. What I found with the help of this documentary, both in published magazines and online articles was at minimum enough to scare anyone who would just take the time to reveal the truth for themselves. If I had continued to listen to the mass media and those not acting in our best interest I might be dead. I highly encourage everyone who has been wanting to know the truth about vaccines and the times and reasons surrounding them watch this documentary and do a little research for yourself too. One final note. I used to be one of these people who went around touting it's science and I'm not even a scientist. I believed Faucci and fellow scientists, never knowing they are the majority shareholders of the company holding the patent on the vaccine. Look up the facts for yourself.",False
7,1,No facts. Just opinions,dobraashe,n/a,15/08/2025,"This isn't a documentary. There aren't many facts presented in this movie. It's just opinions and propaganda paid for by the very lucrative anti-vaccine movement. There's a lot of money to be made by pushing the multibillion dollar ""herbal"" industry. The biggest advantage to selling herbal medicines is that no scientific studies are required to approve herbal medicines for human consumption. Anyone can make any claims and sell any product.This movie took a Ted Talk by Bill Gates and cut and pasted to make it sound like he wants to use vaccines to decrease global population when in reality he wants to use vaccines to decrease infant mortality. Anyone paying attention can see where the cut/paste was done.I was disappointed to see Christine Northrop, who was once a well respected gynecologist, associated with this false information.Total anti science propaganda to trick the uneducated and gullible.",False
8,n/a,Anti-vax conspiracy theories,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,This movie is nothing but totally discredited anti-vax conspiracy theories for over two hours. Poorly made and contains blatant misinformation. Don't waste your time with this movie.,False
9,10,NOTHING AMUSING ABOUT THIS FACTUALLY BASED FILM!,beckuswreckus,n/a,15/08/2025,"After noticing physical and personality changes in my friends and community, I had a lengthy conversation with my like-minded nieghbor. When I stumbled upon this documentary I began to watch. Because I paused often to check facts it became a very lengthy endeavor! PLEASE REALIZE that a documentary is factual or the result would involve lawsuits filed on the part of the individuals represented within the film! This documentary is not for viewing by the fainthearted or non-believers! The content is enlightening but extraordinarily disturbing. I urge anyone who dares to watch this to educate their friends and family because many secrets are revealed. Everything within this documentary can be proven online and verified easily! I was so impressed that I immediately ordered my own copy to loan to friends for independent evaluation! OPEN YOUR EYES NOW!",False
10,10,"Had to watch again and press ""pause"" then Google the ""FACT"" to investigate, Holy Crap, I could find everything they showed was true.",tony_88-896-357529,n/a,15/08/2025,"You won't believe it cause it's so demented it can't be true, but I did the research and the vast majority I found the same documents easily on the internet , read them and came to the same conclusions they did.Their were very few that that had possible alternate inturpitations. However adding everything up together I would have to admit that there is a whole lot of truth to this film, and it scares me to think about it.There are a few other films that play well with this one such as died suddenly. Oh and a book called Behold a Pale Horse by Milton William Cooper. Both the pdf book and the mp3 audio book can be downloaded for free.There are more documentaries that I can't think of the names right now, but I'll try to find them and add a list to this review.",False

1,8,Very interesting subjects and beautiful visuals,melwinbauer,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Welcome to Earth"" starring Will Smith has somewhat of a weak start, but the rest of it is pure gold. Visually, each episode is amazing. Some of the environments we visit throughout are breathtaking and there are tons of gorgeous shots in each episode. The content of each episode is good too, some of the topics are more interesting than others, but that is entirely up to personal taste. To me, episode 2, 3, 5, and 6 are the best ones. Will Smith is a great narrator to follow in the show. He adds some comedy and he is very likable. Overall, this is a series that I'd recommend. Some of the subjects are incredibly interesting and the production value behind the series is amazing.",False
2,8,The music and the sound make a real difference,vidagabi-429-803187,n/a,16/08/2025,"The concept is nice, also, eho doesn't like Will Smith? There is also awesome cinematography here. But the amazing music and the soundscape is what was truly mesmerising me in this series.",False
3,9,Interesting and absolutely stunning cinematography,scubafiend,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm only half way through the first episode (will update if my opinion changes as I proceed through the episodes...) but so far I am entranced! It is visually stunning and fascinating to experience this amazing adventure! Sometimes having a 'celebrity' involved can ruin a production but this is NOT the case here. Will Smith brings a genuine dimension to these unique experiences. He does a great job of explaining things he is learning in an entertaining yet serious way, and he is authentic in his nervousness and the fears that he is confronting. While his films show more extreme adventures, as he acknowledges - this is real. I'm truly impressed and will continue watching!",False
4,10,"Bigest ""aha moment"" since BBC Planet earth",farnia-akhondi,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have no words to say. This series make be question everyone I have ever learned before, how much more there is to know about this world we live in and how little we actually know. I question what I knew before about how I explored sound, smell, vibrations, colours etc. I REALLY hope I will se a part 2, 3, 4 in this series. We have only scraped the surface of what we know. Thank you Will Smith! This is the greatest thing I ever seen.",False
5,10,Intense and Super cool to watch,missmomosa,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a good series.Yes, this has been done before, yes Will was kept safe, like duh do you know the insurance they had to get for him to even do this so let's cut the obvious stuff out okay. They were working on this for a few years so yes, he trained to do these things right. Common sense people.This is educational and having Will narrate it is pretty cool, he has a nice personality and is genuinely funny. He really makes it fun to watch. I really enjoyed the intensity and the way each episode told two sides of what was being experienced or happening from different points like when the episode is about swarms it shows both under water and on land. The cinematography is great. He's not doing this alone. The information you're learning is from the experts, he's just narrating what they tell him too, Will isn't an expert nor claims to be one, he's learning in this too as well as some of the ppl he's partnered with.Those writing reviews because you dislike Will Smith, that's not giving a review. No one cares that you don't like him. Review the content.",False
6,10,Best. Docuseries. Ever,kieracaldwell,n/a,16/08/2025,This was literally the coolest docuseries I've ever seen in my life. It completely changed my entire perception of the world and I would watch these episodes a million times (have actually already watched it 2 times). I Have never felt compelled enough to leave a review for any TV show so I'm doing this in hopes that it will inspire more episodes to be filmed......,False
7,10,Gorgeous views and sound. Must watch.,fierceeagle-40009,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm only a few episodes in but let me tell you something this is just beautifully done. If you have a 4K Dolby vision tv with home theater surround sound this is a must watch. Episode 1 is amazing visually. I hope they continue to do these doc's with Will Smith.,False
8,6,Pretty good,Chuck_EM,n/a,16/08/2025,The cinematography and direction of this show are superb. All of the guides are really interesting people. The show would have been greatly improved if the main narrator would simply have been left out of it.,False
9,10,Magnificent material,rodolfodavalos,n/a,16/08/2025,Magnificent material that shows how the planet Earth is an extraordinary and fragile gift. One of the most beautiful and well-made documentaries I have seen.,False
10,6,The music is so distracted!,abudayah,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn the first episode about sound, was really amazing and full of new facts for me. However, I used a headset to listen carefully for the sounds, the volcano sounds for example but unfortunately, the volcano sounds was heavily interrupted by music and digital sounds that's make you hard to identify which one is real and which is true!And the worst one was the sound of frozen lake, I couldn't tell if the sound is real or it's digital so skipped the whole part.Other than that I enjoyed the rest of it.",True
11,10,Unseen and Unheard part of our own Earth,GauravArora1977,n/a,16/08/2025,A must watch for all those who are explorers and love nature. The locations shown are real HEAVEN ON EARTH üòç üåé Lucky Will Smith to explore all these places with professionals. Direction was awesome and drone shots taken were mind blowing.,False
12,7,Let me soften my critical first reaction,philalethes-85721,n/a,16/08/2025,Guess I've been raised on too much Attenborough and BBC English! Will Smith is a good Everyman for 'Murican edjukational level. Nonetheless it is still informative and the photography was magnificent. It speeds along which is no doubt to appeal to the short attention span of the Tik Tok generation. Yet there is delicious quality in this fast-food snack byte presentation.,False
13,5,Meh!,WarRelic2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great show for kids, I suppose. I have been to a few of the locations on the show and can tell you, for a fact, Will and Co were never far away from a parking lot. Particularly in Iceland.",False
14,8,My senses are renewed,capwelltiffany,n/a,16/08/2025,I don't think this is your normal travel show. I love how each episode teaches your senses to look at the earth differently. Will Smith takes different approach to traveling.,False
15,10,Awesome work.,lifewithkt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Will has that amazing personality, and when you combine that with exploring the earth, it offers an unique combination. I would definitely suggest this series to the youth, and people who are not normally into nature documentaries... It's around great.. Hopefully I'll get the opportunity to do something adventurous with Will, we have the same birthday, so it's always been a dream!",False
16,9,So far so good,raemclaughlin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've made it through the first three so far. Visually it's beautiful, as most nature docs/films/shows are. My favorite episode was the Mount Yasur volcano, but both the ocean and Serengeti episodes have been nice too. Contrary to some of the reviews I've seen here, I think Will has narrated it very well and I felt like he was very engaged in each episode. I think he has come into each episode open and interest in learning from each expert/biologist and what they share. If you already have Disney+ and enjoy nature docs, you have nothing to lose in giving it a watch and seeing if you like it.",False
17,10,Another five seasons please,invictusplc,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is everything one wants from a documentary. The combination of Will Smith's personality and well researched subject matter from a clearly competent production team delivers on all levels! Simply awesome with breathtaking visuals. At the end of each episode I felt more connected with , and in awe or our Earth, and wanting to protect it. Most importantly it did not take the incessant lecturing of an old 'has-been' like David Attenborough (who's best is well behind him) to make me feel this way (not that he's succeeded lately anyway). The BBC wildlife documentary guys could learn something from this for sure!",False
18,n/a,"Earth, Science, Nature & Will!",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Growing up watching Disneys Wild Kingdom, Jacque Cousteau and David Attenborough with my parents.. Welcome to Earth brought back so many wonderful memories.With so many facets of exploration, science, discovery coupled by common sense but easy to understand narration, it was hard to just wait a couple of days for the next episode.We started watching it last night Dec 11, I'm listening to & watching it while I pitch for clients.Congratulations to the production crew, scientists, explorers & Will for an outstanding series.I hope this continues with many upcoming seasons.Donna Segura, Publicist

19,7,dumbed down,philalethes-85721,n/a,16/08/2025,"Will stares at the desert sand with his sidekick. ""You're, like, all Zen man.""
This is Disney Katzenberg woke level education for twitter twits and Toob Boobs.",False
20,9,Gorgeous eye candy.,planktonrules,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show consists of Will Smith as well as a few VERY daring adventurers pushing the envelope in their exploration of the planet. Many of the adventures are one-of-a-kind (such as their walking into an active volcano) and a few are beyond crazy!Although Will Smith is the star of ""Welcome to Earth"", the real star to me are the cinematographers who filmed this Disney+ series. It has some of the best and most amazing camerawork you can ever find...and is as good as you see on other great television documentaries, such as ""Earth"". Truly eye-popping and a show best seen on a big HD television.",False
21,10,Exciting Six-Part Documentary Exploring Far Reaches Of The Globe,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved Welcome To Earth, a six-part documentary featuring Will Smith traveling to the far reaches of the globe in search of Earth's hidden secrets. It is exciting to watch Will find himself in places few have gone before, which forces him to conquer his fears as he embarks on life changing expeditions that alter his perception, and the viewer's, of the world we live in.Audiences will follow Will from the Nambia Desert to Norway, from Brazil into the depths of the ocean and to top of a volcano, as well as to other fascinating places. He witnesses the secrets of nature in hidden places that most people don't often see or notice. Viewers will be both educated and enchanted by the wonders they encounter in each episode, especially since the different camera angles and tricks that capture the speed of movement give viewers images of these incredible sights.My favorite scene is in the episode called ""Descent Into Darkness"" when Will Smith and Melissa Marquez (a marine biologist) travel by submarine 3000 feet below sea level to a mind-blowing place that looks like another world. They explore and learn about a variety of sea creatures that live in the Twilight and Midnight zones below the ocean. It's fascinating to learn how the animals communicate using bioluminescence, the emission of light. And since a very small percentage of the ocean has been explored, Will's below-the-sea trip is particularly meaningful and also quite terrifying. I also appreciate how each experience has expert guides. Many of them have faced challenges of their own which makes it even more interesting. It's eye opening to hear from multiple people on what they're passionate about and learn about their past. Ultimately, Will Smith is an incredible host who combines humor with education and is very enjoyable to watch.The message in this series is that you need to face your fears in order to defeat them. You can't let your fears stop you from pursuing your goals. Will gives the advice to ""work with your fear not against it."" He is constantly pushing himself and testing his limits, too. There is some mild cursing that parents should be aware of.I give Welcome To Earth 5 out of 5 stars. This documentary held my attention and got me excited to learn more about Earth. I recommend this to ages 11 to 17, as well as to adults. By Carlee S., KIDS FIRST!",False
22,4,A positive change for NG documentary style,chughad,n/a,16/08/2025,"National Geographic documentaries have never been gripping mainly because of their storytelling that's so lackluster. Nothing beats BBC in storytelling, poetic narrative and superb music.But WELCOME TO EARTH changed some of that. Beautiful visuals and sounds accompanied with a score by Daniel Pemberton, this series could hit all the positive checkpoints had it not been for a poor script and street language by Will Smith, not to mention his callow reactions and stupid remarks throughout. The last nail was driven by the black and white studio recordings that blew a viewer's retina just when their eyes were getting focused for the suspenseful darkness of the series.Will Smith simply destroyed the entire drama that the directors and the producers had to work so much hard to create.I could have very easily given this series a 9/10 but the above-mentioned negatives things have made me give it 4/10, that too out of sheer generosity.",False
23,10,Will Smith at his most epic self,dacian-predan,n/a,16/08/2025,"An inspiring documentary that showcases the wonders of the world and the connection between nature and its species all over the world. Will Smith is at his best, always charismatic and challanging himself. Cinematography is one of the best I've seen. After Will's recent releases (his momoires, latest movie, youtube series etc), I can say that 2021 ia the year of Will Smith!",False
24,10,The best host,prof_adolfo_lugo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Your narrative is very goodVery exciting scenarios, very good image qualityA greeting will, i admire you, of the best human beingsAnd what more can I say. Simply fantastic series.",False
25,10,Excellent.,tblonski,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cinematography and format is superb, Will Smith is a class act and fun, really enjoy this series hope to see more episodes the future. Worth watching.",False

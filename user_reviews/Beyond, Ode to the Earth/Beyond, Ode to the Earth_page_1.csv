1,7,It might not be what you think it is.,erik-51686,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWe went to the permiere in the Ziggo Dome Oct 4th. André Kuipers attended too and his short explanation in the first minute of the movie is telling - it's *not* a documentary, nor a movie with a plot. It's kind of a mashup of space travel footage with the music of Vangelis. That makes this kind of an 'experience' - maybe as close as most earthlings will ever come to experiencing a trip to space. If you plan to see this, make sure to go to a theater with excellent sound, in this case that's a must. It's a trip, a ride, an experience. If youe seen enough of earth from the sky or if you really don't like Vangelis - this might not be it. Lastly - it's not so much for children, since it's mostly sitting and watching without a plot or any action. Check trailers before you go!",True
2,8,Beautiful view on our blue marble,ptvcbmfpv,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt gets more interesting in the scenes where humans are involved. But the truth is that earth can live without us, but not the other way around. The launch of three different rickets is interesting and also shows the development of the different countries. When we were in Amsterdam at the launch party there were also astronauts talking about their experiences. And that added to the understanding of certain aspects of travelling to space. Rusty, kate and. Koichi explained their sensations. And you could relate more to the movie because of that. It is Andre's product and we thank him for the beautiful sights and music.",True
3,7,Beautiful but .....,jokette,n/a,16/08/2025,Beautiful pictures.But it didnt mention the locations which was kind of frustrating to. This is the main reason I give 7 out of 10 pointsWith every scène I was wandering: where is this?Maybe they can add this!Nice to see the departure of the crew and how they are sitting waiting to arrive at the space station. How can they stay there for so long.Amazing footage.The music is fabulous by Vangelis and Armin van Buren.It keeps you wandering how this is all possible.Not only the possibilities of being in space.The universe has so many secrets and we are the only living creatures on this blue ball.,False
4,9,The effect of a piece of Art,carmen163,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought it was a beautiful film, although I can also understand why it was given a 6.7 on IMDB. But I enjoyed it and I was disappointed when we traveled back to Earth and then the lights went on in the cinema.The condition is that you follow André Kuiper's instructions and do not think or analyse, but simply absorb the images and the music. That took me a while, but then something happened. A bit like what sometimes happens with art; you no longer analyse the painting, but literally the 'art' enters you. That was the case now. Mother Earth 'was' there. Not in relation to a natural disaster, or how certain animals live, but really as herself. It seems that at such a moment a certain part of the brain is activated. The music certainly played a role in this.Maybe that was also because I had no frame of reference. I did not know how far we were from Earth, so I could not estimate the size of things. Very special. I was also aware that space travel contains the pinnacle of human ability. The greatest experts in the field of physics, biology, but also in dietetics and psychology come together to make their best contribution. That enormous concern to achieve the highest possible quality, that was also in the film. André Kuiper spent hundreds of hours selecting the most beautiful images and the best matching music and in a certain way that came across to me. I was literally in tears when the images of the reflection of the sun on water passed by. Wow, how unbelievably beautiful.Maybe a film for a special mood, but a must-see as far as I'm concerned.",False
5,5,The video and music go really well together,GitaarEddy,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI saw it today in the movie theater. The movie starts with a spoken introduction by André Kuipers, and then about 15 minutes of amazing footage of the launch. Getting the rocket ready, seeing closeups of the excited astronauts. Really cool!After that it's an hour of video from the ISS with music. No voices, no subtitles, just cool videos of our planet with great music. It's nice, but it's a lot of the same. I've seen André talk about his ISS mission in a theater, and that would've been great in this movie, to have him talk about what we're seeing.It was a great way though to spend the Sunday afternoon in the cinema and sit back and relax and enjoy a different view on planet Earth.",True
6,5,It was decent.,oliralt,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI saw it in the premier it started of great with the launch. That was awesome with great sounds but after that it got boring quickly. Just some pictures of earth don't get me wrong they were good but just boring after nothing new except recording of earth. It would have been way better if there were more parts of the film of the internation space station to have more variation in what happens. But overall the film was decent the sound was great you could feel it when for example with the launch. Nice recordings and it was nice to also see for example with the Chinees Rocket launch and when of course Andre Kuipers launched.,True

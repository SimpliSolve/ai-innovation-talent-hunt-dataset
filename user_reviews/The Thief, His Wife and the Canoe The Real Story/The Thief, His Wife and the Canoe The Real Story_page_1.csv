1,5,Didn't really add anything to the drama programme,bsconsulting,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you watched the 4 part ITV drama, which I enjoyed, this programme didn't really add anything to the material I had already seen. It's interesting to see the real husband and wife , and they were well portrayed in the drama, but that's it.",False

1,5,Only Anitta Fans!,UnitedStories,n/a,16/08/2025,"If documentaries were just glorified Instagram stories, Larissa: The Other Side of Anitta would be influencer of the year-glossy, over-edited, and thin on substance.Anitta's journey from Rio's Honório neighborhood to global stardom is inspiring, packed with enough drama and grit for a compelling documentary. This film promises to reveal ""Larissa,"" the woman behind the pop star. But instead of depth, we get a 90-minute PR reel-montages of Coachella, Carnaval, VMAs, Latin Grammys, and her Madame Tussauds wax figure unveiling.Even its attempt at vulnerability-comparing her struggles to Carmen Miranda's and escaping to the Himalayas for yoga and skiing-feels unconvincing. A great story was there for the taking, but this film settles for bite-sized moments aimed at Instagram and TikTok audiences who might not bother with her previous Netflix docuseries.",False

Anitta, Larissa, I love you in all or nothing, in funk generation/romeo or mantras. Thank you for letting us know you a little bit.

4,10,Larissa,paulaizabelle,n/a,16/08/2025,"We can finally get to know who Larissa is, after seeing Anitta shine for so long. Through the eyes of Pedro, her childhood friend, we can see her. She is vulnerable, smart, and sweet. She is deep.This movie does not focus on her accomplishments and victories, it shows a different side of Anitta that's been hidden from the general public. And it also makes us think about our own lives, accomplishments and the meaning of life.I've been crying and rethinking my whole life after watching this movie. Am I choosing to be happy? Am I not? What can I change?Go watch it, I promise you won't regret it. Amazing!",False

6,10,a great story,imdbfan-7074029839,n/a,16/08/2025,"I deeply admire the way she narrates her journey, describing a process of self-discovery where she makes herself a priority and finally finds herself. Larissa took control of her life, breaking away from the image of herself as a machine, much like Anitta. She redefined her existence. Carmen Miranda, a crucial figure in her journey, became her salvation, not only in terms of identity but also in mental health, teaching her that overworking doesn't justify the relentless pursuit of an imposed perfection of success.The reflection that emerges from this transition is simple yet powerful: the value of life is not in exhaustion or the endless pursuit of recognition. Had Anitta continued on the path without stopping to understand herself, there would have been no room for Larissa. Today, she not only shapes her own journey but is also creating a new generation, one that, inspired by figures like Anitta and Carmen Miranda, can learn to balance success with humanity, reinventing the concept of work and artistic identity. The message is clear: being authentic, being human, is the true legacy to leave behind.",False

I really think is worthy to watch it. Not only Anitta's fan but everyone that wants to understand the woman behind the artist and all the struggles she hides.",False

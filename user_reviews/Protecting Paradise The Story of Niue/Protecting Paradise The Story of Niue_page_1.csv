The photography was stunning & the story must be told & supported. Though there is a comment at the start indicating coarse language, there is none unless you consider humpback whales coarse language. Children can see incredible sea life, learn about tiny islands in the South Pacific, see native dancing, & begin to understand the dangers climate change pose to our oceans. Parents can break out a map & show their children the importance of even the smallest reef or spit of land in helping scientists learn how to make a difference so we can save our planet.",False

1,5,Typical tabloid documentary,nigel77,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Melissa Caddick disappearance and financial fraud story captivated Australian media and public attention for some time after it became known in 2020. Typically, this television production erred on the side of conspiracy with neatly edited grabs to stir the viewer's emotions and psychological disposition.The documentary, later televised as two-parts on streaming channels, favors the sensational at the expense of substantive evidence to support the underlying narrative.The documentary is also quick to point a sticky finger at a key protagonist (Ms Caddick's husband) who admittedly comes across as less than honest in his interviews with the police, and the scenes of him with his luxury car, a 2016 Audi R8 V10, are deliberately signaled (and perhaps reasonably) in media overdrive.",True
2,7,Well Worthwhile,trackerzsuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Extensive interviews with Caddick's victims, spouse and the journalists who broke the story make this well worth the watch.I too could have done without the Facebook group members. Their opinions aren't really relevant and including them wasted time that could have been better spent elsewhere. Big miss on the part of the filmmakers to have spent so much time with these guys.I'd have like to have seen more time spent on Caddick's psychology and the circumstances that led to her discovery. Caddick had a long history of dishonest behavior which could have been explored more. Caddick's prior employment history could have and should have been explored by the film makers.",False
3,1,Pandora's box,xicoperez,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is only the second review that I have written in 19 years on IMdB. Why this one? Because this was the worst documentary that I have ever watched.Like many documentaries, different experts were interviewed, including a journalist, a forensic scientists, and a financial investigator... but then they added another two experts. What was their field of expertise? They were ""Facebook commentators""! They got two blokes off of a Facebook group to go on telly for one to say ""I think the husband did it"" and the other to say ""after reviewing his body language, I think that he is involved""!If documentary-makers start doing this, we are ******!IMdB really need to give ZERO as an option for ratings.",False
4,1,Worse documentary,danthomas-17824,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just don't bother. The writers are terrible and just a couple of conspiracy theorist. A documentary with social media ""commentators"" lol the worse people on earth are social media prats that like to stick there nose in where they have no business. Makers of documentaries need to stop using the keyboard social media conspiracy planks. It doesn't make for good television. One social media prat on the programme said ""she wouldn't commit suicide, she has a son!"" it's a documentary about a woman who ripped off her own family and friends.The social snippets that pop up on screen are annoying. If I rate it 0 out of 10 I would.",False

1,9,Powerful and hard hitting,colinliddell-73922,n/a,16/08/2025,Like many of the players from the region this documentary is hard hitting and will hopefully have a big impact.It clearly shows the inequality and obvious imbalance in power that exists in the rugby hierarchy which is not open to change.Shows that rugby is ran at the top by people who do not encompass the values that rugby prides itself on,False
2,9,Important and hopefully game-changing,david_pollitt,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Pacific Island nations provide world rugby and many of world rugby's elite teams with players of magic.
This documentary brings, at last, the inequalities and exploitation behind the Flying Fijians, Manu Samoa and Tonga to the wider public consciousness.
Passionately told by those at the coalface, at personal risk in many cases, campaigner and ambassador Dan Leo exposes hypocrisy and corruption at the heart of the international game.
This film lays bare the myth that rugby's values set it apart as the true ""beautiful game"".",False
3,9,A must watch for all sports fans.,macaulayshiel,n/a,16/08/2025,A fantastic documentary which highlights the exploitation of the Pacific Islanders by one of the biggest sports in the world. Changes in rugby are needed and needed now!,False
4,10,Watch it even if you don't like rugby,hfcowie,n/a,16/08/2025,This doc exposes the inequalities and injustices built into international rugby (as well as corruption in Pacific Island rugby at a national level). You don't need to care about rugby to be interested in this story.,False
5,10,Hard hitting and shocking facts,geekoro-77711,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a shame this documentary has to exist, but it does a great job of exposing the corruption in world rugby and highlighting the struggles faced by Pacific Islanders. A very well-made documentary, let's hope it makes a difference to how Tier 2 teams are treated",False
6,10,An eye opening must watch,abbeyruthmiles,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an amazing, eye opening watch into Pacific rugby. The documentary is a truthful story, that gives so many valuable and deserving people a voice that they haven't had in the same way before. Dan Leo gives light to such an important topic and Callum Drummond's cinematography brings the story to life in an amazing way.",False
7,10,Thought provoking. ¬£80 match fee for an international player is appaling.,simon_pett,n/a,16/08/2025,Watched this documentary and the spriit of the Pacific Islanders shines through. The tier 1 nations should be ashamed and right this wrong now.,False
8,10,A must see for anyone who likes equality and rugby.,jasonulstet,n/a,16/08/2025,Simply brilliant. A deep thought provoking informative piece that's exposes the self serving nature of tier one nations. It also shows the incompetence of World Rugby and their willingness to restrict the growth of the game for short term financial gain and not long term sustainability.,False
9,10,Superb documentary,gashf-86701,n/a,16/08/2025,Tier One administrators need to watch this doc and hang their head in shame at the appalling treatment of Tier 2 nations. Added to that the internal greed of the Pacific Islanders own administrators who appear to be prime ministers etc and you see the appalling treatment of players who are used and abused and ultimately thrown away once they retire. Sadly these players if they have any sense aspire to play for tier 1 nations rather than their own countries due to the money and being able to provide for their families.Dan Leo does a great job in this doc highlighting the disparity that exists and I hope it will help their cause.,False
10,7,A no thrills documentary that packs a punch,adammcgheeuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you like and follow rugby, it wouldn't be any surprise to know that the majority of the worlds top players originate from the pacific island nations of Tonga, Fiji and Manu Samoa. This documentary through the accounts of past and present island players, shares a glimpse of the harsh social-economic realities they face to represent their countries.Pros:
-Brilliant narrative
-Links with current affairs
-Direct interviews with heads of state and game.Cons:
-Pursuit of being subjective at the cost of narrator and Samoan legend Dan Leo.
-Production could had been a bit tidier ie filming and interview scenes.",False
11,10,Must watch for all rugby fans,olih_uk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rugby values are a huge part of what the game brings to everyone involved. Fans, players, youngsters getting into the game love the sport because of its values. To see the governing bodies not behaving in a way that is true to those values is ugly to see. This documentary turns the lens on what the powerful incumbents don't want people to see. The story is told by a passionate and brave man who impacts his career and risks his personal safety to stand up for what is right. Everyone in the rugby family; fan, player and official should watch this and play an active part in helping to make the changes necessary for a level playing field.",False
12,7,I don't get it,stipevukic,n/a,16/08/2025,"This what happening in Rugby in Oceania, happening in footbal in Africa, baseball in Cuba, etc. Economy and big leagues brings money. Hope sport in general will change, but I doubt. Btw, beautiful country.",False
13,10,Opens your eyes,minshawsarah,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really hope this will open the eyes of everyone involved in world rugby. Amazed these countries don't get anywhere close to a fair price of tickets sales when they are what bring people in, it watch the best of the best play rugby.

16,10,IMPACT,fgbgxaqj,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is a real eye opener to all sports fans, but especially rugby fans.

Definitely recommend and please share with all of your friends/family who have an interest in sport/rugby.",False
17,10,Eye opening,maverickbud,n/a,16/08/2025,Highlights the vast difference between tier 1 and tier 2/3 nations. A must watch. As an international rugby and premiership rugby fan I was shocked by the corruption and ignorance in our game.,False

25,10,Reality of Pacific Nations Rugby,robpickup,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being a massive rugby fan & having played with/against my fair share of Fijians over the years whilst serving in the Army. I've always had an interest in Pacific Nations rugby due to their personality, contribution & flair.This documentary highlights how badly treated the Pacific Nations rugby unions are treated & it is not only shocking but a real shame.We should be working with these nations to make them stronger & allow them to be more competitive on the international stage. Allowing a team from the Pacific Islands into Super Rugby is merely a drop in the ocean of what needs to be done.Hopefully some people of real importance high up in the unions see this & make some changes as a result.Off the back of this documentary I would love to volunteer my time & potentially do some coaching in the beautiful Pacific islands.",False

1,7,"A nice trip down memory lane, but....",karenbridget-01788,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved Lost, even the ending! There is quite a lot to enjoy in this film, especially when the stars of the show are talking about the series so fondly. What I didn't like was that it spent far too much time on fans of the show, a number of whom were really rather boring and totally self obsessed. It was more about them than the actual show!! This got worse later on when there was talk of some toxicity on the show, giving these narcissistic fans a chance to wallow in victim mentality droning on about diversity and inclusion etc. This was followed by the sob stories and illnesses suffered by some of these fans. I wanted to watch those from the show not people I have absolutely no interest in. I'd give it a higher score if they cut out the dreary fans.",False
2,6,"Wonderful and well produced, but too much time wasted on non-cast/crew",TheWatcher17,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed most of the documentary, it was very well produced, it was wonderful to see a lot of the cast and crew reminisce on their time on the show, their views, and lots of behind the scene footage and how scenes were made and explanations of certain decisions throughout the show. What I didn't enjoy was that the majority of the documentary was people who didn't even work on the show - podcasters, bloggers, fans, etc. And a lot of it was unnecessary, dragged on, annoying opinions and self-gloating. These people should have only been one small segment, but instead they gave them time throughout the whole documentary, giving them the majority of the screen time. They should have focused more on the cast and crew and the many amazing people of Hawaii who worked on the show. The short Hawaii segment was beautiful and uplifting, but it was so short and unfair compared to the amount of time those egomaniac random people got. There were also a lot of cast and crew who were not in the documentary or cut out, and they really should have taken the time to include them as well (if they wanted to be included of course). Overall, it was great to watch that got me really missing the show and how there hasn't been any other show like it ever since (maybe ""From"" is the closest we'll get to it). That's all for now, and I now want to re-watch LOST again for the millionth time lol.",False
3,8,Beautiful documentary for the fans,Ark3456,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a huge LOST fan I was following this documentary since it's announcement.and Indiegogo campaign which I signed up to. There is a lot of passion put into this project and thus you can tell it was made by fans just based on the easter eggs and refferences alone it feels like hey that's something I would say or do.All of the cast and crew involved with the show share a similar passion to the fans when talking about the show and their recollections. Evangeline Lilly, Hugo Reyes, Michael Emerson, Daniel Dae Kim and M. C. Gainey in particular stood out to me as stealing the show with their stories and involvement. Not to discredit anyone, many people involved have their moment here.The production quality for the documentary is extremely high, with the sets, music, camera work, etc all being professional at the highest of quality. You wouldn't notice that Disney/ABC were not involved with the production. This is the sort of quality you would come to expect from Netflix, Amazon, Paramount etc.Getting LOST takes you on a ride from the conception of the show all the way to it's finale. With various stops at major events on and off the show. With a run time of exactly 2 hours you can appriciate that not everything can be discussed in depth.I found that this was an experience that largely focused on the fandom of the show. With the cast, crew and others all discussing the impact of the show and the rise of the internet fan. This does make up a significant theme of the show. If you are looking to get ""lore related answers from the show"" then you will be very disappointed as it doesn't really do that at all and to be fair was never it's intention.If you watched the show as it aired then this is likely more for you. Those who watched it long after it aired it might not have that same impact on you. While you still can enjoy it in a retrospective approach I'm not sure it will have the nostalgia factor that is ever present here. Throughout most of the documentary I felt like I was part of the fandom again and it does a wonderful job inviting you in as part of that LOST fandom/community. That is the greatest quality of this documentary in that it makes you feel included. So to the creators they did a bang up job with that.Now staying loyal to the show we can't have light without dark. So now that I have mentioned the positives I have to bring some balance here with negatives. Two players, one light, one dark, right? As another reviewer has mentioned here already the documentary promoted several cast and crew during their marketing campaign who don't really feature at all here. I would much rather have heard from those individuals than anyone who has no relation to the show. No offence to said people, I am sure it was a wonderful experience for them to be in it. But I can't imagine how the cast and crew who gave so much of their time only to barely feature and be replaced by someone uninvolved with the show, that's got to sting.Another negative is the writer's room controversary, I know it is a terrible situation and some feel it needed to be addressed but personally I disagree. I think that has already been done with the journalist's book and media attention. Why do we have to do it again? Do we have to talk about it everytime LOST comes up now? If they had to feature it here then I feel they should have made it brief... which it wasn't. The worst part about it was honestly the timing. I was riding such a high of joyful emotions (as I mentioned feeling part of this fandom again). Then the controversial topic came up and it was just a real downer. It killed that momentum I was riding and then soon after the documentary came to its conclusion and it never afford the time to regain that joyful momentum and while I should have gone away on a massive high (which they had established and isn't an easy feat) they then spoiled it and I went away almost with a sour taste. I know that wasn't the intention of the creators here so I wish they would have caught that during editing.Personally I saw this documentary as a celebration of the show and I could have done without negativity and just had it all be positive to quote Barney Stinson ""all rise baby"". But even if they HAD to have it in there, get it out of the way earlier on and allow the time to rebuild that joyus momentum and then you still get to go away in a postive manner.Anyway those are my negatives and while they don't out weigh the positives it did have a knock on it. Just in future watch-throughs I would skip that chapter, I don't need to hear about it again and again and again. It happened people aknowledged it and now we can move past it I don't want it to be a stain on the shows history.",True
4,10,Getting Lost is an incredible tribute to a beloved show.,Radzinsky1977,n/a,16/08/2025,"Getting Lost is an incredible tribute to a series that changed the television landscape forever 20 years ago.Taylor, Ralph, and company have so eloquently captured the lasting affection that many of us feel for the show. It will make you laugh; it will make you cry. Above all, it will remind you why this show continues to reverberate with us today.It's way more than a love letter to the six seasons of the show; it's truly a celebration of the fandom and communities that sprung up because of it, many of which still live on today.Getting Lost features interviews with many of the cast and crew, along with notable podcasters and personalities who offer remarkable insight into the making of the show. At times both humorous and poignant, deeply moving, it is a fitting tribute to this groundbreaking series and the community that keeps its legacy alive.",False
5,10,A love letter to LOST and and its fans!,danielgrupp,n/a,16/08/2025,"On September 22. 2004 a plane crashed on a mysterious island. It was the start of LOST, my favourite TV Show of all time. I didn't know back then but LOST would change my life quite a bit... My english language skills were realy bad at the time but I learned how to speak english just by watching LOST.And the only reason I even watched it in english, was because I didn't want to wait a year before it was translated and dubbed in german. Which was the only (legal) way to watch american shows back then :DBesides english, LOST taught me many life lessons and I would not be the person I am today without it.On September 22. 2024 I had the opportunity to celebrate 20 years of LOST at the World Premiere of GETTING LOST in LA.This amazing documentary tells the story of LOST and its fans. And how it changed and impacted so many lifes in these 20 years.I would like to thank Ralph, Taylor and everyone involved for this great documentary.In my opinion, this was the missing puzzle piece to explain why LOST is still loved all over the world by so many people.It is a must watch for any LOST Fan!",False
6,10,WE HAVE TO GO BACK,saguarocoffee,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGetting Lost, a fitting title for a documentary that celebrates not only the twists and mysteries of the beloved show Lost, but more poignantly, the community it created. This documentary offers a unique and heartfelt look into the powerful bond that Lost still holds over its fans. Focusing on the immense global fanbase, Getting Lost dives deep into what this journey meant to the viewers, bridging distances and uniting people in a way that makes it clear: we are all part of one Dharma Initiative family, drawn together by the unforgettable island and its enigmatic allure.The documentary is skillfully structured as a cohesive story, interweaving intimate interviews from the original cast, devoted fans, bloggers, podcasters, and authors, each sharing their journey and admiration for the show. Rather than a dry collection of talking heads, these voices resonate as one, highlighting how Lost became a home for so many. From the extras who played a part in the background to the dedicated fans who launched blogs and charities, every perspective enriches the tale of this fandom-a testament to the lasting impact of the show.Surprisingly, Getting Lost doesn't shy away from the controversies surrounding the Lost writers' room. The documentary addresses these issues candidly but doesn't let them overshadow the show's legacy. Instead, it acknowledges the complexities of the series' production while still celebrating the landmark storytelling that cemented Lost in television history. This balance ensures the documentary honors the show's ambition without undermining the reverence fans continue to feel.A standout moment came during the Q&A session with the director, where an audience member shared her experience with Cancer Get Lost, a charity born out of the Lost fandom. Her story and connection to the late fan featured in the documentary underscored how deeply this show has impacted lives, inspiring acts of compassion that extend far beyond the screen.Watching Getting Lost is like being pulled back into the island's magnetic field. It rekindles that nostalgic pull, reawakening the emotional rollercoaster that was Lost. For many fans, Lost set a new standard in storytelling, establishing a benchmark for every show since. Each twist, tear, and character arc feels just as profound now as it did when we first got ""lost"" all those years ago.Though the documentary shines brightest when focusing on the fans, I would have loved more discussions about the show's iconic plotlines or the actors' personal thoughts on certain mysteries. But ultimately, Getting Lost knows its true purpose: honoring the fanbase that has kept Lost alive in both heart and mind. This isn't just a retrospective; it's a celebration of a fandom that still thrives, driven by the same curiosity, passion, and love that fueled the original series. As the final credits rolled, it felt less like the end of a documentary and more like finding our way back to a place that's still as beautiful and nuanced as the first time we saw it.",True
7,5,Missed opportunity,DrLeatherface,n/a,16/08/2025,"With Lost being my favourite TV show of all time, I was so so hyped for this but it doesn't tell us anything new or noteworthy. Pretty much everything in this is either common knowledge for even the most casual of fans and everything else is just regurgitating stuff from all the behind the scenes on the dvds. It's such a shame how they wasted about 40 minutes on podcasters and other uninteresting people when a bunch of people actually involved in the show somehow ended up on the cutting room floor. They announced guests that never appear or are just a brief video segment with no interviews. It's a completely missed opportunity and I'm sad about that.",False
8,10,An extraordinary love letter to a community and paradigm shift in television history,hari-ramakrishnan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the chance to attend the UK premiere of this documentary at The Phoenix Cinema in London. Over the next two hours we touched on the originality of the show's writing, the music, the impact on the cast and crew, the controversies associated with the show and most important the connections the show allowed us to develop with other people. Friendships, marriages, families and charities all arose from this fandom and the documentary manages to capture all of this flawlessly. Lost was a paradigm shift in television, in many positives ways but even in ways that weren't for the best it inspired a landscape in television where future creatives don't have to fall down the same traps. A must watch for anyone touched (or frustrated) by the show, 10/10.",False
9,10,"A good entre for the ""Lost"" fans",toonarly,n/a,16/08/2025,"Binge watched this show a few years after it came out and never even heard of it or saw a trailer and was hooked. I watched all the seasons in about 2 weeks, then did it again with my wife a few weeks later. This was a fun, sci-fi feast with a stellar cast of unique characters. Be sure if you have finished this series completely to be sure to see the ""actual last episode"" called ""The Man In Charge"" it is considered the only episode in the ""lost"" 7th season (that doesn't exist). I think they wanted to give the fans a little better ending than the last episode of season 6 which seemed to disappoint many. This little short tidbit brings a lot back to the table. Hope you can see it.This documentary explains the show well with cameos of all the players, shows lots of scenes and if you haven't seen the show, don't watch this first. Hope someone comes up with another paradox sci-fi that runs for 7 seasons with 22 episodes or so each season again!, maybe a series about a group of people who are able to be just out of phase with reality to move through things.",False
10,10,Visiting dear friends,mcoffman-39597,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew this documentary would be fantastic. I didn't know it would create such an emotional response. It was like visiting dear friends that I have not seen for 20ish years. Seeing them reminisce and tell behind-the-scene stories was delightful, and I found myself pulled into their world once again. The director addressed some of the very uncomfortable aspects of the production with what I thought was a fair and balanced accounting of events and consequences. Refreshing to be able to delve into the dirt of this part of the story but still come out cheering at the end for the phenomenon it became.",False
11,5,Not what I expected,joshmshivers,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI backed this project a while back and have been excited to see it ever since. I've been checking in and following all the updates.I would get excited every time I saw that they got another member of the cast or crew to be involved and couldn't wait to hear what they had to say. Unfortunately a lot of it came down to ""Wow, you guys really liked the show, huh?"" and not really much else. All these great people had interviews done and it felt like more effort went into the interviewing of random fans.The documentary isn't so much about Lost as it is about the fans of Lost and how it CHANGED THEIR LIVES. It makes sure to remind you of how Lost changed people's lives over and over. Yes, there are interesting portions about the people involved in the podcasts and things along those lines, but I only need to see so much of the SNL guy or the random woman who had way more screentime than anyone I wanted to see.I was onboard for about the first half until I realized that it wasn't going anywhere beyond what it already touched on. It drags its feet and gets into political topics, ideology stuff that felt out of place, and focuses WAY TOO MUCH on the toxic writers room stuff without even touching on important details.In the end, it felt like we were promised one thing, but got something entirely different.",True
12,10,A perfect documentary if approached with the right mindset.,DavidDeRienzo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Getting Lost, Taylor Morden's documentary about the mid-2000s cultural phenomenon Lost, brings a refreshing and much-needed perspective on a show that defined an era of television. While the documentary has received some critiques for focusing more on the impact Lost had on its fans rather than an in-depth exploration of the show itself, I believe this choice was both intentional and thoughtful.For those expecting a deep dive into behind-the-scenes stories, this isn't the film to quench that thirst. While there is plenty of that to go around, the making-of content for Lost has been thoroughly covered in DVD extras, special features, and a plethora of interviews throughout the years that most of us have already watched. What Getting Lost offers is something far more personal and poignant: a reflection on the way Lost has embedded itself into the lives of its fans and influenced popular culture.What truly sets the documentary apart is its intimate exploration of fandom. It's not just a fan base; it's a community that rallied around the mystery, the heartbreak, the theory crafting, and the shared experience of watching the show as it aired. Morden captures this in a way that feels both nostalgic and celebratory, spotlighting a variety of voices, from casual viewers to superfans, who explain how Lost shaped their lives. Whether it's fans reflecting on the series' philosophical themes or discussing the thrill of weekly water-cooler conversations about the latest episode's cliffhanger, Getting Lost taps into what made Lost not just a TV show, but a cultural moment.While some may lament the lack of focus on the making of the show, it's worth noting that Morden's documentary is more concerned with legacy than logistics. It examines why Lost has endured for more than two decades, remaining a touchstone in the conversation about TV's golden age. Fans will find themselves reminiscing about the way the show made them think, feel, and even connect with others in ways they didn't expect. It celebrates the profound emotional impact of Lost, even as it grapples with its controversial finale and the unresolved questions that still linger.This isn't a making-of documentary-it's a love letter to the fans and to the unique, immersive experience of watching Lost unfold. For that reason, it succeeds in ways that more technical documentaries may not. Morden doesn't just document the show's creation, he captures its essence-why we watched, why we cared, and how Lost became a part of our collective cultural memory.So, if you're looking for a story about the mechanics behind Lost, this might not satisfy that craving. But if you want a documentary that captures the magic, mystery, and emotional journey that made Lost unforgettable, Getting Lost delivers in spades.",False
13,10,Thrilling Introspective about the TV Industry's 2000s breakthrough,cpeezy2342,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is an incredible full-length feature that honors every aspect of ABC's LOST.The crew do an excellent job weaving first-person accounts of what that island was like - both in fiction and in reality - for everyone that remembers. Additionally, this film establishes a context through which casual or new fans of the show can appreciate the industry.It becomes clear through this film that every passing day from May 23, 2010 (The LOST Finale) has been building for such a compilation as this. Hearing from countless actors that range from headliners to background extras, this movie draws you into the beautiful world of LOST and everything that transpired to bring it to fruition.This documentary does more than honor the show, too, as it seeks to demonstrate the power of community. Evidence abounds that today's world of podcasting, social media fandom, and binge-worthy TV has LOST and its creative minds to thank.The same way LOST is ""more than just a TV show.."" so too is Getting LOST more than a documentary. This passion project finally establishes LOST fans alongside the legacy of the show in the world of film.Getting LOST also affirms that the ending of LOST, and the journey that preceded it, have cemented themselves in what might best be described as TV's hall of fame. The show has stood the test of time. The same will be said for this documentary.",False
14,10,As Good As Independently-Funded Documentaries Come,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had been tracking Getting LOST on social media for quite some time before it finally became available to rent. Not only am I a huge LOST fan, but I was excited to see something commemorating the series' 20th anniversary. But of course, independently-financed documentaries are always going to be a bit of an adventure quality-wise. Fortunately, this one is as good as they come even without studio funding!Basically, director Taylor Morden covers all the key areas in which LOST was successful, controversial, and/or changed the game when it came to network television quality. From the mind-boggling pilot to the immediate skyrocketing success to the controversial finale and everything along the way (plus after), Morden provides excellent series coverage.While generally being very positive about LOST's legacy, Getting LOST does not shy away from the more recent reports of the writer's room or production not necessarily being the most welcoming place. Generally-speaking, though, Morden plays fair with these topics and gives a wide range of thoughts/opinions on that topic. It had to be addressed--and it is--without slowing the overall narrative.The true hallmark of Getting LOST, however, is the sheer number of interviewees it procures. From producers to show runners to writers to actors to superfans to podcasters--I could list them all but it would almost be easier to name who didn't participate! The breadth of interviews in this doc would be impressive for a well-funded production, much less one largely financed by individual contributions. Not only does this provide some ""insider info"", but it is simply fun for LOST fans to see what everyone is up to now!Even the special effects are fun here, with DHARMA paraphernalia, polar bears, and other LOST iconography used to mostly comedic (though sometimes dramatic) effect.Ultimately, I really could not have asked for anything more from Getting LOST. Truly a fitting 20-year tribute to one of the greatest TV shows ever created!",False
15,4,"A documentary about Lost fans, not about the show.",JF-K19-80,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'd been looking forward to this for a long time, but when I finally got the chance to sit down and watch this two hour documentary I was pretty disappointed.I was enjoying it to begin with, it was great to see all the cast and crew being interviewed, but it quickly became evident that this was a documentary about Lost fans and not about the show itself.So much wasted potential getting all the cast and crew together for this, but they were completely sidelined by all the fans being interviewed and battling each other to prove who's the biggest fan.Absolutely nothing about the fan's stories were interesting, they could have been anyone talking about anything. I didn't sit down to watch a documentary about random people fawning over their favourite TV show, I was expecting the cast and crew to talk about the making of the show, to learn something new.It could have been 30 minutes long, without all the pointles fan interviews, and even that would have been pushing it.Such a shame that this potential was wasted.",True
16,10,Getting Lost- A Masterpiece That Stays With You!,ScouseTrooper,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Getting Lost"" is, without a doubt, one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It's a perfect blend of behind-the-scenes insights from the cast and crew, delivering fascinating revelations-some of which Lost may have preferred stayed hidden! But it doesn't shy away from exploring the raw, unpolished truths, giving fans a richer understanding of what went into creating the iconic show.What truly sets this documentary apart, though, is its focus on the fans. Too often overlooked in retrospectives, Getting Lost honours them as the heart of the franchise, almost as if they were part of the cast themselves. It dives into their stories-their heartfelt love for the show and for each other-and the sense of community that Lost inspired. Watching fans share how the show brought them together, often in life-changing ways, is both heartwarming and deeply emotional. By the end, I was left in tears more than once.This documentary doesn't just revisit a beloved series; it reminds us why Lost became a cultural phenomenon in the first place: its ability to connect people. For fans like me, it felt like being welcomed into a family.I can honestly say Getting Lost will stay with me for a long time. It's not just a documentary-it's an experience that celebrates the beauty of storytelling and the communities it creates. Simply unforgettable. Thank you!",False
17,9,Great Documentary For Fans of the Show.,xjmmhvmgn,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFun film clearly made by fans of the show. It was great to hear perspectives from the cast and crew who were involved!I could have skipped the segment on the 'writers room' controversies of 2023 and how conflicted a few of the fans featured within the doc were shown to be as a result... it felt a little forced.I'm low-key done with being beaten over the head with Hollywood issues... I get that it's essential to shine a light on and that people were impacted, however, near the end of that segment of the documentary I was leaning back in my chair just wondering, ""When do we get back to the main star - the reason I'm here - to celebrate the incredible story of LOST!""Was great hearing interviews with JJ and Damon Lindelof too!",True

The so-called documentary of the show shares nothing new, save just how many podcasts there are on ""Lost."" One would expect actors interviews would reveal how the cast related to one another, favorite scenes, etc. Instead, thus is just a rehash of information that has been out for the 20 years since the show premiered. The 120 minute ramble spends a lot of time on the pilot and how the show got picked up. There is also a whole lot of self-love among the ""fans"" (podcasters and other pundits).

E. I. Before D. E. I. Existed.When in reality is feels like someone wanted to spread more of this ideology in exchange of some green paper.Nothing about it feels genuine.After about 40min they start talking about it ...and you can even see a whole section about complaints with the crew... i mean like who wants to know what the heck happened during your quarrel ?!

The show was what it was and the reason it succeeded was because it didn't embrace social issues and if had done so they would've lost its popularity.

And, frankly, that isn't of interest to me.It was nice to see most of the lead actors interviewed (though I wish Matthew Fox had agreed to participate; he was always my favorite character), but still most of the time was spent on the fans' stories.Also, the part about how toxic the writers room and set was seemed just shoehorned in.",True

I lasted a little more than thirty minutes before shutting it off. Yes, fans are great. Yes, the fanbase was particularly enthusiastic and helped propel the show onward. But I'm much more interested in the production and the story behind the story. What was shooting like? Did the cast and crew stay on or near the island? What was its actual location? Most importantly, for me anyway, what did the writers know or not know ahead of time? Was an ending conceived early on and worked toward, or are the rumors true that Lindelhof and co never really outlined that far ahead in the writers room? And / or did something else happen forcing the ""it was all a dream"" (if I recall correctly) final episode?Speaking of recalling, it's been a loooong time since I watched LOST.

The very fact that this whole thing was made, 14 years after the finale, with nothing new, and is primarily composed of this delusional notion that there is anything of substance in the ending only serves to further prove the point that it was just bad.You think it was beautiful?

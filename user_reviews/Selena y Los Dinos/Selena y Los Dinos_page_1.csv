1,8,Beautiful tale of Selena,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.Selena Quintanilla is one of the most important Mexican-American singers of all time and how she shaped the music industry, culture and people has left a great impact. With this personal and emotional documentary, the director does a great job on exploring about Selena Quintanilla as a person, exploring through some of the most personal moments in her life, her journey and what made her music, and herself as a person, unique and interesting.Using perfectly balance of archival footages, discussions and presentation, it feels like a memory, a memory that is documented through a photo book. Where you find yourself reliving the past memories and seeing things you never thought you would, but now, are being seen. The atmosphere and direction this documentary tells is very good and emotional. You might know of Selena Quintanilla and her background but this documentary does a deeper insightful of who she was, her background and moments that will leave a shiny impact to those who adored Selena.As for myself, I am not the biggest Selena Quintanilla lover but having known her history and her impact, this one hits a bit close home.",False

1,7,Emotional,ducrueal,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is very interesting. We feel all the emotion and the pain of Jack Garfein in his voice. The relation between his own life and the film that he realized is explained in a very good way. The flashbacks which happened in the all film are powerful but it can also lose some viewers. We get closer of the character by learning more and more about his story and how he became a great realisator. To talk about the movie's realisation, it is original. The pictures and the music add an aspect of sadness and reality. That's why we felt like we were with him.Nevertheless, it was a little bit long.We recomand you this movie if you like real story and biopic.",False
2,7,Our point of view,perrinedupe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst, it was interesting to discover the life of a director that we didn't know and it was nice to follow all Jack Garfein's life steps. He lived a part of History : The Wold War ll. And unfortunetly he was a jewish so he was into a concentration camp.But it was a bit slow because in the movie there is no action so sometimes the story feel long. However it was emotional and the story of this man can touch us because this life was not easy every day. This man is important to the US cinema industry because it was out of the frame and this was detrimental to him and also that help him to became an important man.",True
3,9,Great film,madison-40215,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a very interesting movie that allowed us to discover the life of Jack Garfein. Tessa Louise Salom√© did a great job as she offered a unique view of Garfein's life. The Flashbacks were well introduced in the storyline as they were linked to the present. He was ahead of his time and his point of view on Hollywood was really interesting to learn. In our generation, we don't watch old movies anymore, but this movie made us want to discover some (The Giant for example). Also we find it kinda odd that Garfein's movies didn't get any success as they treat important subjects (like military issues, rapes,...).Too bad he died before directing one last movie.",False

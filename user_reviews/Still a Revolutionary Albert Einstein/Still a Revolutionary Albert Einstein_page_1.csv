1,10,Most Of The World Has Heard Of Him But Not Of His Activist Life!,silicontourist,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was told about this man in a science lesson in school, very briefly, and learnt nothing at all about him in history classes. That lack of proper educational topics is still rampant throughout world education today, but that's a topic for another time/place! I luckily found him to be a very interesting person just because E = mcÂ² fascinated me so, most of the information in this documentary I was already aware of from my research of/about him.He was much, much more than the Mr Theory of Relativity guy and, I would go as far as to describe him as possibly the most humane human being of the entire 20th century. He spent his entire life caring (something the majority of society today does not do) about humanity's lack of love and inability to live peacefully with one another. He is also famous for having said, quote, ""If we don't end Wars, they will end humanity""!.Everything this wonderful person thought and fought for as an activist has been exactly my way of thinking/life since I was a small child. Watching this will be the one of the best lessons you never got taught in school!",False

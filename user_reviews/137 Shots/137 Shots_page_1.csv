1,7,Coming from someone who's not an American,AaronRush9,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm from the UK so over here there's some police brutality, but not as casual as it is in America it seems the system is at fault watching this documentary seeing how some officers react to a situation and see red 137 shots thats absurd give a human a gun and they think they are a GOD that's the way I see it, not saying every single officer is unstable or racist but I think the system needs to background check and control officers that are coming in for example the man who jumped onto the car and fired at the two victims, served in a war in his eyes this situation was like he was back on the front lines, America in general is its own matrix I could never understand the politics and how guns are just essentials over there but it will always be runned by law loving politicians and there will always be corruption....",False
2,7,EVERYONE Should be ACCOUNTABLE,kvnnagel,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know that there is nothing anyone can say to Tamire Rices mother to besiege her anger or Sadness. A mistake is a mistake, sometimes mistakes come with dire consequences. Accountability is a TWO SIDED STREET. Now, I've never had any love for cops or police departments, I spent years as a career criminal and outlaw biker. But I also always recognized my own accountability in the actions I took ESPECIALLY when it came to incarceration. Police had a job to do, get me off the streets.. I tried to avoid getting caught.. There were bad cops, certainly there were. Dirty cops were Bad Cops. But then I had. Choices... if I jumped out of a car with a gun, I would EXPECT to be fired upon. If I had a car chase I would EXPECT a bad outcome. I remained ACCOUNTABLE for my actions. If I don't want to get shot by an over zealous cop I WILL COMPLY. If I had a weapon I told them I had it and I kept my fingered interlocked on my head. And certainly things still may happen, If you don't want to get shot don't force the cop to make that choice. I don't know if they will be AS ACCOUNTABLE as I am, but if you watch what's going on in the world right now it's a complete LACK OF COMMON SENSE if you think that attacking a cop will have a positive outcome. If you're being questioned and you want to be belligerent.. THERES AN OUTCOME to that behaviour.Criminals.. BE ACCOUNTABLE.., COPS be ACCOUNTABLE and if you have a choice to comply or attack UNDERSTAND that it has CONSEQUENCES.",False
3,5,"Not bad but not amazing, it is informative though",18Buddha,n/a,16/08/2025,"I see such split reviews with some accusing it of being woke propaganda and the other side applauding this documentary.Im asian n i have no love for cops at all and i was a troubled youth that got into lots of trouble with the law many times from the start of my teenage years into my young adult life.Racism with white cops is real n theirs alot of bad ones But theirs also many good white cops also, now I cant say if each of those cops who killed an unarmed black person was a racist or not but i think that the perception of black ppl being dangerous or bad usually comes from the community themselves.In my city most crimes on average are race divided, so for example :
most gun crime deaths are 8/10 times committed by black teens/adults and my city does not have an overwhelming population of more black people then whites like how in america does, so if black people represent an overwhelming amount of violent crimes in my city not being the most dominant in populace then imagine how it is in cities in america where blacks outnumber white ppl in population?? Their crime stats would be even higher by 10x! Or more!Most robberies with weapons on the street or at stores are also majority black, home invasions also are too, as well as brazen shootings in public places like busy streets or inside malls or wherever is also majority blacks as well.Of course crimes are also committed by other races too but in my big populated city the higher percentage for these violent crimes are usually done by black.These black gangs terrorize neighbourhoods n then the black community blames the cops for not protecting them and yet these same communities refuse too help cops solve murder cases to stop gangs in their neighbourhood out of fear. They want other ppl to do something n yet they wont themselves.BLM highlights nonstop the past racism from colonial years up to presently for causing how blacks are viewed but yet they refuse to acknowledge that even just viewing them only by the present year alone u will see them as dangerous, no need to even look further back to claim its a persistent racism culture.Now cops now n days get more edgy around black suspects because black criminals tend to kill someone over $1 even, because they themselves view their lives as worth nothing and they also carry the Hiphop culture of how its gangster to shoot ppl that wrong them.Other criminal groups that are white or east asian usually focus on money first before violence because their smarter that way n value their lives more thus they are viewed differently in the eyes of cops. Are their gangs that are white n asian that cause violence? Of course but its not common as black on black broad day light shootings.I have seen lots of racism by white people as a kid but i have seen just as much by black people if not more.I think the perfect saying goes like
""we lay in the beds we make""If u wanta stop black people from being percieved as violent or dangerous then u need to first focus on the overwhelming amount of black kids,teens, adults that join gangs. Only by fixing your community n making it better can u change perception.Even in the criminal world everyone knows u can do proper business with any race except blacks or white/asian gangs that chill with black gangs n heavily influenced by them, because all they do is try to rob people.Asian and white gangs not associating with any black gangs most often will do proper business.Just that mindset alone between the racial divide of crime groups behaviours should already highlight why cops fear black suspects more cuz they are willing to give their life over nothing.U wont see white kids or asian kids trying to rob ppl on the street for $1 or $5 or whatever, thats all black kids.Most cases where cops killed a black suspect often involved the suspect not complying or they make it difficult by trying hard to argue back.Yes theirs abunch of cases where they did nothint wrong but thats literally like 1 out of 10 000 cases. They can find 100 cases but thats still 100 out of 100k cases. BLM paints narrative as if everyone n All of them thats are black suspects is being killed and thats just false narrative.",False
4,7,Non-American's Opinion,brettsanace,n/a,16/08/2025,"Upfront - I am Australian.Yes, this documentary was largely one sided but any discerning person can tell that the police's behaviour during the various incidents, and in their subsequent interviews and court appearances was deplorable.But, in their defence ...If America had sensible gun control laws like the rest of the first world countries, the police probably would behave differently and often would not be put in these situations to start with.So whilst the documentary is mainly trying to blame the police for the specific incidents described a broader perspective, which was not considered in the documentary, could assign blame to American society as a whole.",False
5,n/a,This can't keep happening,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou could say this documentary is one sided however, we've only been hearing the policies side for SO LONG. It's important to take all information with a grain of salt, you can't take everything in this documentary they say at face value.As a non-american I think it's insane how easy it is to access guns. It's ridiculous that these officers who hold ALL the power in these situations can just claim to be scared and get away with killing people. The whole car chase and shoot out could have been easily avoided, why did so many officers circle one car with an unconfirmed shots fired call? The officer on trial clearly is not the type of person who we should want on the streets, claiming to ""protect"" people: Saying he was more scared of a single shooter in a car with multiple other cops around than when he served in Iraq is INSANE.These cops care more about themselves than the communities they are supposed to serve. Drug addicts and homeless people do not deserve to die, or be chased until they have a reason to be arrested. It's a horrifying story of abuse of power and police solidarity. Officers should not be proud they ""won"" a shoot-out. Isn't policing about prevention of crime? They are literally creating the crime, chasing people around who have good reason to be terrified of police. We should not have to be afraid of the people who are supposed to protect our communities.The justice system has failed everyone involved, putting these officers above the law and not holding them accountable. It's terrifying to think that children get killed in their own neighborhoods for playing with toy guns, but police officers can come in and kill anyone they perceive as threatening. I truly believe every single one of the officers who plead the fifth in this case are guilty. I cannot believe the ignorance and lack of accountability that they all have. By refusing to acknowledge the crimes, yes CRIMES, they have committed against the citizens they serve, it is continuing to create an unsafe environment for EVERYONE.No one deserves to be killed, and no one should have more rights to justify themselves for killing others.",True
6,6,Sometimes feels one sided,tarjmehta,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAt times it feels that the documentary has a biased view. My very first question is WHY Mr. Russel did not pull-over when the cops were chasing him. WHY he did not stop even after 50+ cars and 23mins into chase. WHAT did he had to hide? Cops will obviously find it suspicious and they will use the force to stop you.In case of Tamir, my heart goes out to his family and cops are to be held ACCOUNTABLE for their actions. Taking advantage of the 5th amendment is not a solution. Using the law for own good and destruction of civil society is not a step in right direction.The end speech by I guess father of the church (in black robe) was very much one sided. It seemed more like he was motivating people in wrong direction with the use of jargon.",True
7,6,No one has ever seen the flash on the other side?,hamidrezavaezi,n/a,16/08/2025,"I got the same question as the other reviewer has here? What's that light on the other side if the street just before the victim's car passing by?Check 45:06 on Netflix and you would clearly see it.I am confused tbh.Rating, although no one can deny the racism and corrupted police but why some should ran away from police?",False
8,7,What an embarrassment...,katyork-26478,n/a,16/08/2025,To the city of Cleveland these officers are. Just a bunch of bumbling idiots who end up murdering 2 innocent people. Brelo lies in his interview with police because he is scared as he knows he did wrong. He should be incarcerated for life for his actions. All these men and women will eventually pay for the taking of human life. Murder. Not self defense. Lasso is a laughing stock going to schools. What a joke. This documentary made me sick and so sad for the families of the slain victims.,False
9,10,Too many racists providing reviews about this documentary,Cleve714,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am white. I am in a Clevelander. I am a criminal defense attorney. I see the injustice every day in Cleveland courts. All the negative reviews about this documentary are by scared white people. We live in a state of fear that has justified police brutality. The documentary is not meandering, it is simply chronological. Black people in Cleveland rarely get justice. We need more justice for people of color, and we need more documentaries like this that tell the true story.",False
10,5,WOW. COPS ARE CRAY CRAY AND RECKLESS,jdbrunette,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have supported law and order all my life. I follow the law, except i occasionally speed or maybe cheat on the old taxxes a bit. But this doc shows clearly how cowboy mentality runs fervently within most police officers and how that can become tragic. When I saw the vids of 30 or more cop cars racing down the street after a single old car, like a nascar event, it was then I realized these cops were mostly low IQ, meathead, highschool jock, with hero complexxes and a need for validation. Well made doc. It avoids showing the false and fake cop narrative where they smear the dead. I would recomend it to most people.",False
11,8,Can 137 shots be justified? Simple answer: no,doc-away,n/a,16/08/2025,"If these Cops were in the military (...and I'm a 20yr vet) they'd have been charged with war crimes.An clear case of shoot-first-ask-questions-later, over a perceived, and by no means confirmed, threat.Sickening, but important, to watch.One hundred and thirty seven shots? Seriously 😡",False
12,6,A bit biased but eye opening to watch,souplahoopla,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm from the UK so although we do have police brutality it is just on a completely different level and scale to what you see in the US.This documentary clearly leans in bias against the police officers and prosecutors involved but it doesn't not give them a voice at all.I found it very interesting just how polarised the States are when it comes to race and police relations and how it is dealt with. I didnt agree with the underlying suggestion that the entire Cleveland Police Dept are all crooked, which is just ridiculous, and they did seem to find the very worst 'spokeperson' for them in terms of the union guy. On the other hand i found it incredibly disturbing watching footage of incidents and then the video testimonies of the officers involved; how some just blatantly lied or exaggerated the truth, especially in the case of the poor boy who basically got 'drive-byed' by the Police. And how they are not compelled to give testimonies to the court when they are the ones carrying out the law enforcement and should be made to explain and be held accountable for their actions. The fact that a bunch of people upholding the law and carrying lethal weapons can take the 5th when it comes to their job of protecting civilians is just crazy to me. But what would I know!Anyway in terms of watchability it was good, and kept a good pace and movement between both sides of the argument. I prefer documentaries that dont have a bias so I can make my own mind up, i lose interest when I feel like I'm being led into a conclusion (not that I didnt agree with the overall message of accountability), but it was still an interesting watch.",True
13,3,Started well but lost focus.,Mauseum,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doco is a mixed bag. It hooks you in with the main case and then introduces a couple more. The questions posed about these cases are warranted (was it murder/manslaughter, abuse of power etc) but don't fully explore them. However, about after an hour, it becomes far more politically charged with the BLM narrative at the forefront. This narrative becomes the focus and completely leaves the original narrative behind. I also don't understand why they purposefully leave out information about the cases, besides to appease to the BLM narrative which is poor form when making a documentary. It's completely biased and is a shame because there was plenty to explore within these cases to let the viewer make decisions for themselves. Lastly, the cut scenes of police, SWAT and other special forces using violence against people (not only black people) is to completely exploit the viewer, which was unnecessary and actually doesn't fit either narrative that the doco presented.My recommendation - just look up these cases through Wikipedia as there's more information ascertaining to them there and quite interesting.",False
14,n/a,totally one sided,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,I remember hearing about this on Fox 8 and this documentary is only telling one side of the story of what really happened. The Cleveland Police did their job. Great shots of Cleveland. Sorry this is not worth watching if the whole truth isn't going to be told. Yes i am from and live in Cleveland and we have a really good Police Force.,False
15,6,Even Cornell West's poetry can't salvage the myth of america,sdesavouret,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie should convince you that there is no rational possibility that a ""loving,peaceful"" resolution to the oppression of Black people in this country will ever be achieved.""No, I am not an American. I'm one of the 22 million black people who are the victims of Americanism..."" Malcom X.",False
16,10,"Not a communist, not black, not even a back lives matter protester. Just another white Scottish humanitarian !",chrislawuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't know if its about white, black, or pink poker dots, but these cops are the dumbest murderers ever to cross the silver screen. They formed a circle and started shooting at themselves.One officer jumped on to the bonnet of the victims car and shot 47 bullets in to the two occupants of the vehicle; Black Life Matters bull s**t, owe please! Then as an insult to injury he pulls a Rupert Murdoch defense in court, ""I don't recall that sir"". He was in his late 20's- 30's; whats his excuse, dementia? The only condolence is he got a voluntary manslaughter charge slapped on him, only to be later acquitted. He was the only one of the 13 officers whom fired, who got prosecuted. I take it the other 30 + bad reviewers of this excellent doc are all the bent
cops who took a shot at these unarmed civilians. They were guilty of a traffic offence, what planet are these reviewers on - they deserved to be shot for that? Straight out of Police Academy or Naked Gun. One sided lol.This sort of thing happens time and time again, and video evidence always appears online: homeless, mentally Ill, Kids, racist killings etc etc, gunned down in the most barbaric, over the top fashions imaginable. Of course the ones caught on video are only the tip of the iceberg.In self defence there is a term ""reasonable force"", which describes justifiable cause. How can anyone stand there and say that there was anything reasonable about these events. It was even proven that the officer who initiated the pursuit was lying, as he wasn't even following police protocol. The officers justification- they were ""scared"". Awe..., boohoo. There were 100 police officers in 62 patrol cars, armed to the hilt, vs a couple of civilians with a broken exhaust pipe.If Cleveland is a violent place, then I can see why. A history of violent policing and injustices, breeds more violence and disrespect for the law. Its a snow ball effect.In the Tamir Rice (a 12 year old boy) case covered in the 2nd segment, the officer pulls right up next to him and starts shooting. He was carrying a plastic gun. Impossible officer wouldn't have seen his age at that close proximity. Didn't stop for one second to assess the situation, just came out blasting like Yosemite Sam. Prosecutor McGinty is the epitome of the decay and decadence which has fractured the American Justice system. Retrograde and antiquated. Imagine, he called in the accused officers to sign pre-written statements before the trial.Loomis (no joke, that's his name. What he thing this is Halloween? Must be!) from Police Union should stop white washing his murdering colleagues crimes. Never seen such a bunch of self-serving, self-pitying, remorseless killers, and their accomplices, in all my days.The reason they don't take accountability is compensation costs money to the state, and a bad representation of the police force is politically damaging. The officers all evoked their 5th amendment right, ""to remain Silent"". Omerta! The code of silence, or ""the blue wall"" as it is adequately described as in the documentary. Usually a privilege reserved for the mafia.Give these police a broom and a brush and make sure they get double HazCom training to make sure it sinks in. They should be in jail, think themselves lucky and thank god every day.",True
17,5,One sided??,abc_off,n/a,16/08/2025,The facts were transparent and I mean starkly transparent. Well done doc and should be watched by every American. It screams reform for police departments. These unions included.Please don't let political convictions cloud your knowing right and wrong.,False
18,10,Only one sided if you believe unarmed people on drugs deserve to be killed by 137 bullets!,joiyao,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMy favorite part ""If you're scared get another job""...""if they have a badge and a gun they should be tested""... This was fair I just don't see how a chase deserved that many bullets. No one stoped!! Appalling!",True
19,4,Poorly handled by the prosecutors,meisterpat,n/a,16/08/2025,"If the prosecution really wanted to compel the police officers to testify against Brelo, then they could have granted them immunity rendering the fifth amendment moot. The producers treated them like heroes but it was obvious that the prosecution had its own agenda which had little to do with convicting Brelo.",False
20,10,This documentary is excellent and horrifying.,taienverdain,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before the right-wing troglodytes get here, let me say - Netflix didn't make those cops say the things they said in those clips....they just played them. It's pretty clear that some officers are horrible monsters and that some organizations of police fraternity keep those people safe. This is a huge problem if we as citizens are expected to respect the authority these people in uniform are to represent. This documentary is enlightening and disturbing and I recommend it.Black lives do in fact matter, and some are being taken by fearful children with low IQs (i.e. Bad police officers who should be working in gas stations, not firing weapons).-A white guy.",False
21,1,One sided,natemansur,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a poor attempt at a documentary. It was made simply to deepen the divide between police and citizens. It goes into minimal detail and zeros in on the details that mean nothing. The whole thing is set up as the victims families attacking the police.,False
22,9,Anybody,zacharykieler,n/a,16/08/2025,"The loss of human life here is tragic, anybody who attacks this film for telling the truth you don't have empathy for your fellow man. This whole system is racist from the judges to the police. This is about unarmed African American being gunned down. And nobody is held accountable. Is this America?",False
23,1,This document divide people more,zankkuli,n/a,16/08/2025,I mean only thing this document gave me is higher blood pressure. Nothing truly interesting and factual about these incidents there was missing so many evidence. I recomed who made this movie to move on scifi or some other things. Only thing this movie gave was these same narrow minded stupid people more fuel to blame all the thing they are missing because of theyr arrogance. Arguin with these people is the same thing than trying to proof earth is round like just waste of time and u just made them to believe it more!,False
24,9,Why would cops plead the 5th at a criminal trial?,toddshaw-35909,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone complaining this is one sided, why is Loomis's fat ass all through the film? The only one sided thing about this is how cops witness a crime and then plead the 5th. I bet they don't do that if you're are in trial for something. If there is nothing to hide you don't plead the 5th. You know who pleads the 5th? Guilty people or people who are covering for a guilty person.",False
25,5,Meandering like the Cuyahoga,leroysolay,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's hard not to cry or scream at the injustices documented in Cleveland and beyond. Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams' families get to have their voices clearly heard, as well as Tamir Rice's mother, Samaria. For that, the audience should be truly grateful. However, this treatment of tragedy is, as Dr. Rhonda says, as meandering as the Cuyahoga. RFK's image is superimposed on the River at the beginning, but without a coherent narrative we don't know why until the very end. Local radio host Mansfield Frazier's voice tries to hold everything together, but his post-credit scene leaves the viewer more confused. Interspersed throughout is a gritty photographic love letter to Cleveland, which seemed to be a sort of story of its own. I felt that Director Michael Milano tried to retell far too many stories simultaneously at the expense of almost all of them. He does rightfully take aim at both Steve Loomis and Tim McGinty, eliciting vitriol from at least this viewer. Regardless, the new material and contextualization of these murders makes it necessary viewing.",False

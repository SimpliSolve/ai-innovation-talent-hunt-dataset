1,7,A tender recap of a great carreer,Sil-Azevedo,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the short, Julia tells her story in an intimate, relaxed style, as one would to a friend. In fact, she uses a phone call as a pretext to narrate the entire film. The story is heart-warming, and Julia is a good story-teller, so the 32 minutes pass very fast as the viewer is enriched.This is not a spectacular film, the phone call feels a bit forced, but the story is so compelling and her narrative so sweet that it does not matter. It is easy to listen to her tell her story. I am not sure she was already battling cancer when she made this, but I suspect so. I am glad she did. We are all richer for it.",False

1,7,The Unseen Observer,alexander-je-bradley,n/a,16/08/2025,"More slideshow than documentary, I Am Martin Parr strings together the photographer's striking images with scattered commentary. Parr appears throughout, but his voiceover is rarely tied to a talking head. Instead, we see him at work-relaxed, spontaneous, blending into crowds like any other tourist. You'd never guess he was making the sharp, satirical images that follow.Many of my cinema-going friends didn't know his name, yet recognised his images-proof of their quiet ubiquity. The film avoids deep dives into his inspirations or class themes, instead embracing the idea that photography is often overanalysed, smothered in grandiloquent discourse. Why not just let the images speak?On the big screen, they do. Their poetry, humour, and sharp social observation shine.",False

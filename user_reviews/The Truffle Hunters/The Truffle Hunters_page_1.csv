1,7,warm and beautiful,mbrcf,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary is about as rare and strange a subject can get in a film which is the art and the cult of truffle hunting. Now chances are you know nothing about truffles, I know I didn't for that matter. truffles are some sort of auromatic subterranean fungi that can not be cultivated by man in any form or rate, but only be discovered and sold by a handful of old Italian dudes and their trained dogs.I personally crave for these sort of documentaries which reflect on something I wouldn't have crossed otherwise so I was absorbed and captivated by this film. It employs a beauctiful camera work, at times mounted on a dog, it is very warm and heartful and watching those old men and their dogs go on a hunting session on forests and fields had a very enigmatic charm in it. This is a solid documentary if you like food, dogs, old charming Italian men or wacky documentaries.",False
2,8,"Dogs, Adventure, Scandal and more! Fascinating and informative",rannynm,n/a,17/08/2025,"With all of the chaos in the world, this down-to-earth film, The Truffle Hunters, is perfect to sit down and watch with a bag of popcorn and enjoy. There are dogs, adventure, scandal and more-what's not to like? The Truffle Hunters is a documentary any dog lover will particularly enjoy, as well, since dogs feature prominently in the search for these underground delicacies that mainly grow in woods.The Truffle Hunters follows four truffle hunters: Carlo Gonella, Sergio Cauda, Aurelio Conterno and Angelo Gagliardi about their work finding truffles along with their dogs. This documentary takes viewers on a journey into the behind-the-scenes process of sniffing out truffles. It is an analytic and emotional exploration of how this indulgent treat is procured. These four truffle hunters are in their older years in life, but still carry an inspirational passion for what they do. Their dogs are no less amazing: Birba, Biri, Charlie, Fiona, Nina and Yari. There are so many elements to this film that make it unique, for example, the cinematography, done by Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw. The different camera angles and perspectives allow you to get a bird's eye view from atop a tree of a man and his dog charging on the snowy terrain or you could be seeing from the POV of a dog hunting and sniffing for truffles along with your human. These different perspectives allow audiences to really embody some of the characters.The Truffle Hunters was really fascinating to me, because I had no idea what truffles taste like, but after watching this documentary I can't help but imagine. Before the truffle ends up in a wealthy person's mouth, we are shown what happens along the way: the unbreakable bond between hunter and dog; the questionable transactions between hunter and seller; the selling itself, and oh-so-much sniffing by wealthy people looking for an expensive treat. My favorite part of The Truffle Hunters is with Carlo, and his loyal dog Titana. Every scene with them in it is sure to pull on your heartstrings.Perhaps ""enjoy the finer and simpler things in life"" is what everyone will take away from The Truffle Hunters. Or maybe the message is, ""sometimes it is good to stop and smell...the truffles."" This documentary does contain some description of mild violence, smoking and drinking.I give The Truffle Hunters 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

3,8,Great visuals that take their time.,ndewild,n/a,17/08/2025,"Great film with amazing cinematography. The story is original and interesting to watch but shots do run a little too long at times. It is not told in a traditional documentary format, which made me curious to what would happen next. Lot's of information was sneaked into my mind that I did notice until later in the film.I do wish this film was a little bit better, the idea and summery was very intriguing to me but because of the slow nature in shots I did tend to get bored.If one is a dog lover this is a much watch.",False
4,n/a,Observing old Italians hunt truffles.,n/a,n/a,17/08/2025,"To me this isn't really a documentary, there is no commentary, no explanation, we just see static camera shots of people going about their daily lives. One snippet of an old man washing his dog, both in a tub. A scene of an old man eating his dinner and giving a bite to his dog. An old man and his two dogs climbing a hillside in the woods. Two men bargaining on the price of a few grams of fresh truffles. Two men talking about the idiots who poison dogs.What all these have in common, they are involved with the ancient art of truffle hunting. I found it interesting but not captivating. It gave me a glimpse into a life and livelihood, or hobby, I knew nothing about. And I am glad about that. However if I were to assign a rating on the 1 to 10 scale, compared to other documentaries, I think ""5"" would be fine. It was satisfying to a degree but could have been so much better with a bit of work.On DVD from my public library.",False
5,7,A pleasant cinematic stroll,eddie_baggins,n/a,17/08/2025,"One of the most gentle and softly spoken documentaries you'd care too see, directors Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw explore the mysterious and unique world of truffle hunting in Europe by planting their cameras and letting the characters of this world take centre stage as they set about to find the biggest and best truffles imaginable.Featuring a colourful bunch of characters, many who are far too old to be traipsing around in the forests that are strewn across the countryside of the Piedmont region of Italy, The Truffle Hunters never bothers too deep dive into either the backstory of our central figures or the history around the whole song and dance that accompanies the truffle industry but despite the frustration of there feeling like a lot is left unexplored or barely considered, it's hard not to enjoy taking a seat and enjoying the scenes laid out in front of us.Beautifully captured by Dweck and Kershaw, with many of the films scenes framed in a way that would make them painting/picture worthy in their staging and set-up, The Truffle Hunters is the cinematic equivalent of a leisurely stroll through a picturesque environment and when you have such charming company as this documentary provides, the experience may not be life changing but its goodness is palpable and it's hard to think of a more nutritious documentary from recent memory.Keeping us at arms length from delving too deep into the motivations, history or circumstances that have made The Truffle Hunters real life cast the wonderfully colourful lot that they are, this documentary proves once more that for all the cinematic characters created for the big screen over the history of cinema, there's still nothing quite like being able to spend time with real life figures that have all their own eccentricities and ticks that need to be seen to be believed and if there's anything more humorous and heartwarming than witnessing an 80 plus year old sneak out of his window at night to go on a stroll through the woods so his partner doesn't catch him, I would personally like to know what it is.Final Say -There's a sense that The Truffle Hunter's could have deep dived further into its characters and subject matter but there's no denying this is a simple and satisfying documentary that is sure to leave a smile on your face.3 1/2 pairs of boots out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",False
6,9,Authentic,ferdinand1932,n/a,17/08/2025,"Old men and their dogs living a simple life in a rural landscape is what this film is about. To fill in time they hunt for truffles, but being in the country and the bond with their dogs is the essence of the story here.The landscape is where it all happens and the sense of place, of mood, even of smell, is captured in the scenes at various times of day. It's quite immersive with the action of hunting being a good part of the film and how the men connect with their beloved dogs.The men are distinct, but also, paradoxically they blend as one in many respects: their lifestyles, their lack of vanity and their bonds with their dogs. If there is one scene that summarizes the film, it's the man who resembles the ancient Leonard da Vinci trying to express why he's frustrated with truffle hunting. He wishes to go back fifty years to a time when being the country, and with the dogs, was what counted, not what happens today where greed is the key motivation. His analogy with seduction is both amusing and telling.The film is structured in short sequences photographed in a static setting, as if they were paintings, with the subjects composed accordingly. There is no voice-over telling us what is happening, no backstory, we have to understand it as the film develops and this works with excellent editing that expands the story while telling us a bit more about each man and his own personal circumstance. It's very direct, unmediated, except it isn't, but it feels that close, as if we are in their homes, in the musty barns, out of the paths and in the hills.The dogs complete the three key parts to the film and without them it would not be as an engaging. They are working dogs as well as much loved members of the family, even addressed as such, receiving birthday songs and treats. The dogs' relationship with the men is captured so well, so intimately and authentically, it is sure to make this movie any dog lovers' top film for a very long time.Many films crave authenticity; they say they are based on real events and inspired by a true story to appeal to our sense of what is true. This movie has authenticity down to the dirt under the fingernails and muddy paws.",False
7,7,A feast for the eyes,maccas-56367,n/a,17/08/2025,"Some of the best cinematography in a documentary you will see. Each scene was a feast for the eyes, and like looking at a beautiful painting.It felt very meditative. A simple way of life depicted in a simple style. But I couldn't look away. I felt increasingly more relaxed as I watched, and further transported away from my own life and into the hills of Italy.The eccentric old men touch your heart and make you laugh out loud. They're also to be admired for the way they go about life and pursue what makes them happy.I loved the relationships they had with their dogs, and the insight into the world of truffles was fascinating too. If you are into ""Slow TV"" type of things (or mindfulness) then you will probably enjoy this!",False
8,10,A documentary that feels like a film,mikeburdick,n/a,17/08/2025,"Honestly, I give out ten's sparingly, because most films aren't perfect, but this one certainly approaches perfection. The name says it all, it's a documentary about truffle hunters and their dogs, yet the film reveals a world most of us have never even thought about much less seen, and in such a considered, artistic way.Each character is so quirky and interesting, and the conversations are so authentic, it's almost as if the entire thing were a scripted film, but of course it's not. What contributes to this aesthetic is the lush photography, the considered framing and the almost art-directed natural look of rustic Italy, where it takes place.'The Truffle Hunters' utterly captivating, human and life-affirming, it's one you shouldn't miss.",False
9,7,Good but,maddox-richard,n/a,17/08/2025,SpoilerGood but I wonder now which dog was poisoned and that plot point I wish had a more satisfying conclusion. Except for the poisoning a good interesting doc. With the poisoning I kinda hope for a postscript which might give me some closure or hope for finding and prosecuting the criminals. Eg a postscript updating how big a problem this is and what the police or community are doing to protect these innocent dogs.,True
10,10,Every shot a treasure,cestead-21796,n/a,17/08/2025,"I love seeing a film showing something I know little to nothing about - and having it turn out to be not only informative but wonderful. The imagination of the photography is beautiful, but having the characters reveal themselves is remarkable. The last shot in the film makes you laugh out loud.",False
11,9,Stunning,lars-carpelan,n/a,17/08/2025,"Real. I just loved

12,4,It teaches you nothing,mwascholz,n/a,17/08/2025,"If you want to know all about truffles, how they grow, what are they, why are they expensive, where exactly are they found, why are they unique, the whole (clandestine) trade behind it, this documentary will tell you absolutely nothing.If you want to look at old men and their dogs in the forrest and dark alley dealings without having a clue who is who, what they are doing and why things that happen, happen; this is the documentary for you.It often felt like an old Marcello Masteroianni movie where not a whole lot happens but it is beautiful to look at and the slow pace fits the whole scene.But boy they could have made this more interesting.And I don't even like truffles.",False
13,10,A REFUGE FROM CHAOS,thunder1road,n/a,17/08/2025,The Truffle Hunters is a documentary with a lot of soul. Real people in real situations - gorgeous cinematography that makes me want to move to Italy - and a soundtrack that should win an Academy Award - Composer Ed Cortes is the heir apparent to Nino Rota and that's a good thing. The tragedy is that the score has not been released on CD - yet. I would buy the DVD just to transfer the soundtrack to my iphone.,False
14,10,This is a remarkable documentary,mounirjkiwan,n/a,17/08/2025,"We're all now very used to voice overs telling us exactly what is going on and building us up to know exactly when the crescendo/twist/emotional pull is about to happen. So, it's refreshing that this documentary just points the camera at amazing scenario, characters and conversations and let's us just work it out for ourselves. Ten stars.",False
15,10,Utterly beautiful,arveljoffi,n/a,17/08/2025,"This movie is stunning from the first frame to the last, and the bonds these old men-some sweethearts, some old codgers, but all moral-share with their dogs is beautiful.",False
16,8,A documentary of a metaphor,jpenha-75970,n/a,17/08/2025,The profound differences between the lives of four old men who have devoted themselves to their dogs and to truffle hunting is contrasted throughout the film with those who make their money and their meals by exploiting them.,False
17,4,Excellent movie for sleep,gorm-34291,n/a,17/08/2025,I knew it could be boring but expected a red line through the film. Cosy yes but no learning no excitement and too much of the same. The nice shots of nature pulled it 2 steps up the ladder....,False
18,10,Amazing movie!,rstolerman,n/a,17/08/2025,"Even being so far away from this particular trade the activity of mushroom picking isn't foreign to me, so this is what got me interested in the first place. When I started to watch it I quickly realized that this movie is truly a treasure that is very difficult to find within the pile of the junk produced today. It's deep, it's rich, it's amazingly done!",False
19,10,Real life,puretna,n/a,17/08/2025,"One of the best movies I have watched recent years. Its slow, maybe not much happens, but its same as ny own life. Ordinary days. Real people. Real struggles. Real weather. Great camerawork in this documentary.",False
20,8,A Fascinating Expose Of Some Unknown Mushroom Hunting Legends.,meddlecore,n/a,17/08/2025,"The Truffle Hunters is a wonderfully shot documentary, featuring some lovingly pure characters- and their beloved truffle sniffing dogs- alongside some rather more loathesome middlemen, who act to unjustly exploit them...in, what is quite unexpectedly, a rather dirty game.One complete with murder, and mafia intrigue.Which goes to show why Italian truffles are among the most over-inflated and costly resources known to man.As a long time mushroom forager, myself...I completely understand how it's ""all about the aroma"".And the grimey game that middlemen will try and play with you.Why I always represent myself, and deal directly with restaurant owners, myself.The truffle hunters, and their pup sidekicks, featured here, are among the most loveable characters you could ever catch on screen.From the 88 year old, who can't come around to listen to his worried wife. To a hardworking man and his two canine companions, he can't stop losing to rogue poisoners. And what seems like the lonliest man in the world (if it wasn't for his dog).These men live for the grind...and it just might be keeping them alive, not to mention limber, at their ripe old ages.Unfortunately, these men are not only the victims of the mafia-style actors working as middlemen...but also the goons who seek to murder their beloved companions...so as to give their bosses a leg up in the game.Something that is both tragic, and angering.Nonetheless, these men need to survive, and thus keep on struggling through all the hardships they face.But I've no doubt that God is on the side of these beautiful men- and their dogs- and will grace them with the most glorious afterlife...filled with hilled forests on which to continue their daily hunts for these most sought after treasures of culinary wonderment, for eternity.Because Lord knows they deserve it.What a magical collection of stories and all around beautiful film.8 out of 10.",False
21,10,I thought they were actors,aggern-52967,n/a,17/08/2025,"Before watching, I didn't check its Imdb page, and never thought it was a documentary. Wow, what a weird feeling it is to realize afterwards that all those people were REAL people, not actors. Strange feeling. Great film!",False
22,1,What am I watching here?,Jimpansy,n/a,17/08/2025,"I like slow, I like old men, I kinda like dogs, I like quirky, like Piemonte, looove truffles.But why am I seeing this?Old guys and dogs. Rain. A clip to something new every 30 seconds. Suddenly the cameras on the dog collar, It's NOT a documentary, it's an snotty art project, just without any relevante? Was I interested? Did I feel anything? Provocative? Funny? Beautiful? Anything?The answer is no. Nonono. Lazy, snoozy stuff. Like looking holiday pics of people you don't know.",False
23,10,BEAUTIFUL,ue-53660,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is a beautiful little masterpiece. The photography is simply stunning and it is an absorbing, relaxing, sweet, sad and funny little picture of rural Italy and the magic of the super expensive Alba white truffles.The language spoken is mostly Piedmontese dialect, a mix between Italian and French.The funny and sweet characters are beautifully depicted.A gorgeous perfect little documentary.",False
24,9,Visually beautiful beyond the level of authenticity,Nozz,n/a,17/08/2025,"It's as beautiful a movie, visually, as you could imagine. But I'm afraid I make a lousy audience. I look at a scene inside the farmhouse, and I think ""How much equipment did they lug in for the sake of that beautiful lighting? And how spontaneous could the dialogue really be with the crew standing around?"" Same thing with the street-corner (black market?) dealing in truffles. I can certainly understand the reviewer who wrote here that he hadn't realized the movie was supposed to be a documentary.And when the lengthy shots of beautiful Italian landscapes appear, backed by nice music, I'm the kind of guy from whom you have to hide the remote. Okay, I think, beautiful scenery. But life is short. Can we get on with the story?Not that there's a whole lot of story, and the cynic in me says that the final scene, although it's a satisfying conclusion, must have been staged by the filmmakers rather than reportorially captured.",False
25,8,Nicely shot but not really an educational documentary,deloudelouvain,n/a,17/08/2025,"The Truffle Hunters is beautifully filmed, that's the main positive thing about it. That alone made it worth watching. And the dogs of course, which was the main reason why I watched this documentary in the first place. Who doesn't like to watch dogs, clever ones in this case? As a documentary though I was slightly disappointed as I wanted to learn something new, like I always hope with documentaries. But here you won't learn anything really, not how dogs get trained to find truffles, nor where to find truffles the most likely, or any other interesting things like that. Instead you get good images of old geezers, truffle hunters and their beloved dogs. Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw, the writers/directors, should have made it more educational to be a perfect documentary, now it's a well shot nature movie, that I did like though.",False

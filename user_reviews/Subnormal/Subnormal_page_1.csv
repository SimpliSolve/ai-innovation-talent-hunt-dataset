1,1,Why Now?,heratyplant,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some sad stories caused by unintentional mistakes confabulated into a devisive story of race hate.Why now, this is around 50 years ago, what's the aim of this, no mention of misdiagnosed white children. The people shown as examples have also exceeded in education later in life regardless of this & merely report poor confidence, common to most people.The professor used to sift the evidence, Sally Tomlinson, is totally one sided & refers to things as bad that are so long ago, it's meaningless.If you can't recognise & accept that different cultures behave differently when mixed together & that this will cause problems, then you can't accept reality.Make no mistake this is totally disingenuous, as are many of the contributors & none of what is said is challenged, everything is bad & you can guess who's fault it all is. Anyone not paying attention would think that Educationally Subnormal was invented for black people, when it wasn't, how could it be it was from the 1940's.The result of all of this nonsense is clear at the end, identity politics, I can only look up to people who look like me WRONG!I hope whoever made this is proud of adding more mistrust & hate to that which already exists in society today, I hope your revenge sweet.",False

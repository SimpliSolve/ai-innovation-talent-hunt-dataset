1,8,"Very well done, informative, educational",monikamarie,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watch lots of true crime and this is one of the better ones. Good interviews with LE, family members, witnesses, etc.; lots of interesting background on the geographical locations. Tells the complete story but keeps the focus on the victims and how the crimes are solved. Hoping for more seasons!",False
2,7,Interesting... The People You Know are A Danger...,Mehki_Girl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSpoilers below...Very interesting cases that I never heard before. It can be a little repetitive as though there are commercial breaks and then they do a little recap, but it goes along pretty quickly. Most of these are focused on the family and not the criminal. One thing I've taken notice and be warned - you're a family and the people you know are where the danger lies.",True
3,10,Guilty pleasure..,umucspring,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this series. Covered murders that took out entire families and often times by the people closest to them. Quiet reenactments, meaning the actors dont speak, story is mostly told by the investigators and surviving family members. Be warned though there are several episodes that cover crimes against the most vulnerable family members such as infants and grandparents.Not for the faint of emotion and at times makes you question human nature. Every single episode has shock value even if your a huge crime investigation fan. Im hoping for a season 2 although its make's me sad to think there are still plenty of true crime cases involving entire families being annihilated.",False
4,n/a,Really well done...,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm very confused by the reviewer who rated this only three stars, as this show certainly does not deserve any less than six or seven stars. It is very well done, very informative and factual, and tries to steer away from unnecessary dramatics. I actually appreciate this, as I believe when you tell these stories, there is a lot of respect that needs to be paid to the victims and their families. By creating something that is overly sensational, they tend to ignore facts and make it all about theatrics without being substantive or accurate. If you're a true crime junkie, this will absolutely hold your attention, and have you wanting more. If you want something that's just purely production focused, go watch a movie.As a self-identifying crime junkie, this was impressively executed.",False
5,3,"Even for worn-out crime genre, the storytelling is rote",thegalaxylab,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not sure why Oxygen keeps churning out dry, drone-y shows without pushing the envelope production-wise. NETFLIX and others have raised the bar but Oxygen wants to make chaff. Good editing, but no emotion in the orchestration. Change composers! Writing is sometimes confusing but the re-enactings are really good, though.Seems like for a show called ""family massacre"" you would actually SEE violence/brutality. Guess what: you don't. You just see really boring cops with zero expression ""oh i walked in the house and saw a mutilated body, ho hum.""",False

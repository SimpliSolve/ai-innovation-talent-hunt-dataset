1,9,I didn't know Michelle was so funny :),tinytorso,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a Brit I must confess I don't follow American politics and first lady's normally but there is something about Michelle that made me want to watch this. I didn't know that much about her beforehand.What a positive lady, representing all the values anyone would want to see in a first lady, wife mum and friend. The way she talks about family, it's impossible not to love her. She was so real when talking about working on marriage and I love that not trying to pretend it's a fairy tale love story all the time.The little anecdotes she told about Barack and family were so funny, I was laughing along with Oprah and the audience.Hadn't heard of the book before the netflix show, defo going to read it.",False
2,8,Should At Least Listen To It Once,AJx91,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was surprisingly good. The current IMDb rating is unjustified, and I usually trust it with +/- 1-degree error. I mainly blame this because it shouldn't be a film but a podcast episode on Spotify.In this engaging conversation, Oprah delves deep into Michelle's recent book, 'The Light We Carry,' imparting valuable life lessons for young people, black women, and all. It reminded me of the self-improvement podcasts and YouTube channels that are so popular these days.I'll need to give it a 2nd listen to absorb more of its wisdom and inspiration. The depth of insight and connection between Oprah and Michelle makes it a true gem in self-improvement content.",False

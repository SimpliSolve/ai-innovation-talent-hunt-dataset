1,7,"Straightforward account of a crime, and an attempted coup",paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAt this stage, there's not much left to say about the 2020 election. Donald Trump lost; he told his followers the results were rigged, and attempted to abuse the system in every way possible to stay in power. In the mouth of John Eastman, one of his most odious followers, his case even sounds plausible: if the election was being stolen from you, then extraordinary measures might be justified; but of course, the only steal was that being attempted by those claiming to be the victims of theft. After the failure to bring Trump to criminal justice, in a few days we may see a re-run with potentially terrible results.",True
2,5,Poor narrator.,staggerstags,n/a,15/08/2025,"The single worst part of this otherwise decent film is the narrator. She is a lazy speaker when it comes to pronouncing her words properly, dropping Ts in every other sentence. And Georgia is pronounced Jall-jah, America is Omerrikah. She is very irritating and takes little pride in her presentation.The footage itself is okay and their are some insightful clips with chief characters. The story runs quite smoothly and progression is mapped neatly. But again, it becomes tiresome when you have to listen to someone who sounds like they dropped out of school early and never bothered to correct or improve their way of communicating verbally.",False
3,n/a,Why bother make this now?,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"He is now president of the united states, the filmmakers were a bit late with this one. Bold Trump, but yet the same director made a documentary called ' Defending Digga D ' about an actual convict who tries to become a rapper, all is forgiven for him though. Biased and hypocritical. I would take my words back if they made a documentary about the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop or Daddy Joe's multiple visits to Ukraine before the when he didn't know his microphone was still on and heard saying ' how much do we have to bribe these guys before they understand they don't have a choice? ' In reference to America putting rigging the Ukraine election.",False
4,9,Felonzilla will love this. . .,clivejamesrd,n/a,15/08/2025,"As far as he's concerned, he is being immortalized and that makes him great again!!! Oftentimes, abnormal psychology is not abnormal to the subject. To the subject the exeprience is just another day, so it's quite normal to him. And, get a lot of this, it follows that those who think abnormal psychology is in fact quite normal so they vote for this human imposter anyway, well they are abnormal too.My detractors say, ""You can't say that about half of the American people. Who do you think you are?""
And I say, I'm a rational man in the lineage of rational men that can be traced all the way back to Socrates and Plato and Aristotle and so it is my duty to point our that in a society of cannibals, thats a society that's 100% abnormal, 'mkay?So if a full 50% of the American electorate are abnormal, that's well within statistical accuracy. I yield my time to whoever magaloon wants to start bleating. Thank you very much.",False
5,3,"Quite unbelievable, but at least it's not the same rehashed tropes",imdbfan-7368056453,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't really like it. It felt too unrealistic at times. For example, why would the poorest people believe that a billionaire who inherited $400,000,000 from his dad is going to fix their economic problems? Just because he said he would? Cmon, people aren't that dumb. And even if he cared, he's a failed businessman who declared bankruptcy 4 times! I found that just a tad over the top.But all of that setup does make it pretty obvious he's got some tricks up his sleeve. I did love the acting, you really feel he is a malevolent conman who will stop at nothing to gain and hold onto power. Gave me chills! Wow! He could be a reality TV star, that main dude.Anyway it kinda devolved into a legal procedural in the last half. Most of the people I saw it with were out drinking beers and shooting guns in the parking lot by the time it ended. I'm not sure it really ""landed"" for most people but that's how these things go sometimes.I also didn't really love the OBVIOUS setup for a sequel - does EVERY movie need to be a franchise these days? Ugh. At least it's really anyone's guess which way it will go in the next one!",False

1,7,Good and enjoyable but might be biased,joeschwindler,n/a,16/08/2025,"My overall rating is subjective and not that important. I'm writing this review because of one very subtle moment I noticed at Ep4 42:00.The CIA officer Brian Latell says Fidel Castro wrote to Khrushchev: ""You must strike preemtively with all of your nuclear forces against american targets. You must not wait for the Americans to fire.""
Yet he conveniently omits the true context of the letter (that in fact did urge the soviets to strike) but only IF the americans invade Cuba first.This might not seem like a big deal and the interviewers opinion is not necessarily the one of the series.But such subtle details (and there might very well be quite a lot more) completely shape what kind of worldview the viewer takes away. Just wanted to tell everybody to be careful with the statements and the possible lens through which the story is told.",False
2,8,A gripping documentary to make sense of our current nightmare...,mdw0526,n/a,16/08/2025,"This new docuseries on Netflix might be the most important show you're not watching. We just finished last night and it's well worth your time; I loved it and learned a lot without much pain at all. It's a good compliment to ""Oppenheimer"" and the Einstein docuseries I previously posted about.A gripping documentary with amazing archival footage, this gives a great macro-level presentation of how we ended up with a Russian invasion of a sovereign Ukraine. The documentary lays out a long cycle of events that began with the atomic bombings in Japan in 1945 and how the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the USSR in 1991 signaled a false end to the Cold War, which has led to Putin's attempt to rebuild the Russian Empire in the 21st century.If you're any kind of history buff like I am, turn on this show. It really helped connect the dots, fill in many missing pieces, and frankly, made the current nightmare we're all currently living in more understandable, though no less tolerable. 😫",False
3,7,Should have been a higher rating but the propaganda element detracted from the overall impact.,charlesr-8,n/a,16/08/2025,"I nearly wrote my review at the halfway point, before deciding to see it through and ensure I was balanced. Unfortunately that didn't improve my impression of the series. There is a lot of great footage and history covered off - some fantastic insights and great scientific information too. But unfortunately they opted to inject some old fashioned propaganda into the final couple of episodes, after foreshadowing this in the earlier ones.In short, what was predominantly a ""nuclear paranoia drove the world wild with fear and led to idiotic levels of armaments at the expense of cultural, scientific, and social advancement"" (on both sides to varying degrees - Soviet citizens suffering considerably more) has an underlying message of ""orange man bad, Putin bad, Zelensky good, Government narrative on war is true, etc""
There's no question that the aforementioned personalities are fraught with issues - but having covered the propaganda, subterfuge, and shadowy behaviour from the cold war, it is hard not to question the way they glossed over how widespread certain actions from the 50's through the 70s were, along with the way they tried to paint current situation.I'm sure the military industrial complex overlords loved the ""war is for peace"" message that it felt like it ended on.",False
4,n/a,European viewer here,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,All in all good series. Does it's job as putting together the whole chain of events and giving the sense that we all just have to sit and endure the ride that the crazy leaders make us go through time and time again.One thing that bothered me was the last episode where the east Berliners etc. Were talking that people just need to be brave again in 2024 and fight back. I agree but a good start would have been for the documentarists to be brave enough to tell the whole story that is unfolding in Europe right now. There is one hybrid warfare measure that is being used and is actively destroying the whole continent. But it is so forbidden to talk about this that even this historical document series did NOT bring it up. So how are you expecting people to have the courage to go out on the streets. Very ironic.,False
5,10,I can't stress this enough,sofiiadibeo,n/a,16/08/2025,"It gives you a wide view of history narrowing down to the modern day as to why things are the way they are, and how by learning from this we can we prevent catastrophes from happening in the future.It's really important to watch it for us, as humanity, to understand our need for the ability to choose and speak freely, and how suppressing that freedom leads to dehumanization, excess patriotism, and personal selfish ambition.If you do disagree with something while watching it that's respectable, but in the end the best perspective the documentary can teach you is the understanding that in the end peace and freedom of choice is what humanity wants and needs.Really recommend it, and I usually don't review movies, but I can't stress it enough - watch it to the end. Because it helps you to form an educated opinion about the present day. And most importantly, how we can truly influence the future.",False
6,10,Exceptional Documentary,TomatoesareRotten,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm old enough to remember when all documentaries were made this well . The chronological facts are masterfully done , even when it leaps back and forward through time . In fact it has to on several occasions to make a very salient point . What surprised me , was the factual gaps in my own personal recollections going back to , as early as , the Sixties . Every day is a school day , as they say. We see the folly of armed conflict and its lasting repercussions , we see people in power who should be nowhere near , man's inhumanity to man but, most importantly, why we never seem to learn from our mistakes and repeat them again and again . I was left with the over arching conclusion , that there are no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"", we're all as bad as each other.",False
7,10,A must see Doc with Insane Footage/interviews from protagonists who were there.,the-webminster,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary covers pretty much all the major events that resulted in and from the Develpment of the Fission or Termonuclear bombs. With high quality footage, 1st person interviews with protagonists, or relatives who were 'there' when an event took place, some were even a key piece on it (journalists/activists) either on divided Germany, the Comunist Hunt in the US, the Cuba Missile crysis, the Bombing of Hiroshima/Nagazaki, Staline rise/rule to power, The Manhattan Project, the race to find how to split the atom and create a chain reaction during WWII. This doc series has it all, 9 hours of exquisite throughput of 80+ years of history and how close we were to face extinction with the press of a few buttons. A much see for both afficionados and everyone really, who seeks to understand the world we live in.",False
8,10,Those that cannot remember the past are bound to repeat it.,scb05,n/a,16/08/2025,"I lived this Cold War as a child in the US who learned to duck and cover, and now living as an adult in east Berlin, and as father to a Berlin child whose mother is from the DDR. I have heard the family stories directly, from Oma explaining propaganda in WW2 through the resistance against the STASI by my family and friends here in Germany.This is a documentary masterpiece of complicated truth and history.Every American and European must watch this series and as one who knows Ukrainians, I am a better person to now understand this complicated would view leading up to this very misguided and unjust war in Ukraine.""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" - George Santayana, The Life of Reason, 1905.",False
9,10,an overwhelmingly extraordinary...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDocument of, and about an era of world-, and especially european -history, a story that actually has been told in many ways, mostly by the 2nd w warwinners, in the decades after 1945, the 4 and a half decades thats called the '' coldwar''.A curruculum worthy insight you will get, and loads of us elderly will still feel the chill of the zeitgeist that ruled our safety norms back then.Its a tv serie that i would compare as valuable to view for the young generations as the thames production ''the 2nd world war'' were for me 48 years ago. It should stand out as a fear of war poster cause the horrors of combat warfare and war mongering tends to be forgotten for every 2.5 generation growing up, and the rise of new world emperors slingng their swords to raise nationalism to a surtain breakingpoint against socalled foes may fool the weak, poor and brainwashed digitized developed population and religious fundamentalists into something worse than armagheddon.To the history nerds that collects film and media material from this era, there arent much new stock footage and film , bare over with that cause its very well knit together. So spend some time on this netflix series is the grumpy old mans advice. Its a valuable reminder of how it was, and may become to an already brittle gen z and x, IF...",True
10,10,"OVERALL MESSAGE, ONE EGO OR ONE ERROR",nmskrkn,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a factual map from the atomic birth of the bomb during WW2 to the current day challenges we face and the ever looming threat of an all out nuclear war.The narrative is revolves around the two superpowers of America and Russia, and their well documented history, a lot of time is given to explaining the paranoia and proxy conflicts following WW2. ( Cuba, Vietnam etc) It is an unbiased documentary and the equal problems all sides have faced. Russia feeling threatened by the expansion of NATO enlisted territories and America, the modern rhetoric given off by Putin. I guess there is an argument for both sides. I myself served in Germany during the cold war.THE BOTTOM LINE... NO MATTER WHAT POLITICAL PERSUASION YOU ARE ,THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE ARE JUST THAT ... PEOPLE.IT WILL ONLY TAKE ONE MISTAKE ... EGO, TECHNICAL OR INSTABILITY.... SO MUCH POWER , BUT JUST ONE MISTAKE!",False
11,10,Been there done that and doing it again!,vinnybellucci,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spent 3 years in North Atlantic aiming our nuclear missiles at USSR! I don't like the idea of nuclear missiles but they were an effective deterrent towards MAD (mutually assured destruction). I would never want to see any of them launched and it's on us to make sure we always have the sanest, most trustworthy politicians leading us. Of course we always get the craziest of them all. This should be a must watched series for as many as possible. But destiny will always take its course and hopefully we don't need to vaporize any innocent civilians to make us realize we can all live together in harmony and in peace....before the oceans swallow us up!",False
12,10,Essential history and a reminder to all of us...,tscanlan,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the most compelling documentaries that I have seen, tying the development of nuclear weapons to our geopolitical history since that time. It is especially relevant to today's geopolitical situation worldwide, especially in Ukraine. It makes the case for continuing to support Ukraine in any way that we can. We should never have ignored Putin's takeover of Crimea. It's unthinkable that he continue to occupy any part of the rest of Ukraine. We need more than a cease fire. Russian troops need to leave all of Ukraine and Putin needs to be reminded by all freedom loving nations that this type of 'nation building' will not be tolerated. That is one of the major takeaways from this series. The other takeaway, even more important, is that nuclear wars must never be fought; no one wins if that happens.",False
13,7,It was pretty good,patmg-94539,n/a,16/08/2025,"Good historical context, quality documentary, jumps around in time are clear and purposeful. Definitely a quality, well thought out production that was well researched and has interviews that provide first hand accounts or with individuals that typically provide high quality information. Provides a large amount of factual information and I most cases does well to provide both sides on matters of opinion. The information gets somewhat less reliable in the last 2 episodes when getting more into current events but that's expected from modern large media productions. But at least they're not covering up and excusing the crimes of communism anymore.",False
14,1,Partial Truths: A Critical Look at Biased Documentary,ali-alnahash,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching Turning Point a documentary on geopolitics in the Western world led by the United States and Russia/Soviet Union, was thought-provoking but marred by bias. The series framed events through a specific lens, often oversimplifying or ignoring opposing views. Despite its high production quality, the series relied on emotional appeals and sensationalism, undermining its credibility. It failed to engage meaningfully with opposing perspectives, hindering a balanced understanding. Viewers should seek additional sources for a nuanced view of history, politics, and global affairs to develop a more comprehensive understanding.",False
15,n/a,Very Important,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every American needs to *actually* watch this. Put all their vitriol aside and consider the entire series before rating/commenting. I realize this is impossible, but I just had to state it so maybe ONE person will consider what we're all here for.This series ties generations together to make sense of where and why we are here, politically. It's laser focused, as far as I'm concerned, toward the very important wide view message that we need to fully comprehend what us humans have done in creating these massive annihilation nuclear devices.I truly think if you disregard this whole work, you are for the destruction of cultures, land, identity, environment, and humanity itself. Not a great place to be.",False
16,10,A wake up for everyone.,shanehantler,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is put together in a very understandable narrative. If you missed history class a few too many times, here's an easy to absorb summary. As a global community we are in a constant cycle of fear, with sycophant's directing our societal norms. It's a terrifying watch, but so is the daily news in 2025.I think Netflix should release this as a free to view for the whole world. Obviously it's told from a western perspective, but gives plenty of space for victims of these events/attacks/crimes to share the pain of atrocity. These docos are so important to bring us all back from the edge of the cliff and start rebuilding our global community.",False
17,9,"Of course it can't be 100% objective, but what an amazing documentary!",rklemm05,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's been a long emotional roller-coaster to watch all the 9 episodes of this captivating show. So instructive, even when you think you know it all already.What strikes me the most is how some insanely small ego-related problems, personal feuds, even misunderstandings, have had such tremendous repercussions on the history of the world as we know it, the infinitesimal stories that made History.And how many times did we unknowingly come so close to the precipice? Makes you dizzy just thinking about it.Also, looking back on what happened since WWII, I'm flabbergasted by how everything we live today has its roots in what we refer to as long past.The show does an incredible job at pinpointing how one thing literally led to another, in a never-ending chain reaction. Watching this is definitely time well spent.",False
18,9,Great documentary - Well Balanced,craigusmaximus-72689,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great and important documentary. I'm not sure why so many people say it's very biased or pushing agenda when it appeared to be very well balanced and mentioned many great facts from history (although most I already knew). In a nutshell... Nobody can win a nuclear war, Putin is a modern day Hitler and America must also learn from its mistakes as it doesn't always set the best example and others think they can follow suite. That's not biased against America in any way as they are a great nation. Mistakes have been made and we must all learn from history or there is not future.Something I've researched and spoken about for a long time is the use of social media to promote Russian propoganda. You just need to look at their bots on YouTube or X to see the Kremlin at work. They aim to divide and they clearly succeed and dividing opinion online. I'm glad this among many other things is discussed. There is a reason they banned social media.",False
19,10,"If you think history is boring, try this series!",spocksdirective,n/a,16/08/2025,"There were sequences in this series that left me speechless, spellbound, with more emotional punch than slickest creature feature or superhero movie that have just about crowded out all other types of low budget or thoughtful, meaningful pictures in the theaters of America.Even though I grew up along with these events (born in the 50's) I have been sort of clueless as to what has been going on in the world all these years. Often, I've just gone along with the prevailing opinions, or opposing opinions because I consider myself to be a rebel. But, watching this series showed me history I had either ignored, been too busy to care about, or being misled by outright lies, well it was a real eye opener.These filmmakers have gotten their hands on footage that was way too graphic for network TV, so most people never saw it as events developed. How often do Americans get to watch Russian TV? Putin with a big smile hiding that devil inside as he appears on TV daily, lying about everything, the people just lapping it up with tremendous applause?Much of it is the work of dedicated and courageous reporters and cameramen and writers and publishers who often put their life on the line to get the truth out. A lot of them died in the process.This series is all about courage. How important having courage is. Not being afraid to admit your mistakes and errors, being willing to change your mind if it becomes obvious you are wrong. How tyrants become who they are. And being willing to stand up and fight for what you believe in, even if it kills you.It's the best historical drama I've ever seen.",False
20,10,Outstanding Documentary,richardstirling,n/a,16/08/2025,Netflix have some great documentaries and this may be the best of the bunch!Starting off from the second world war and taking you up to the current situation this is s documentary that moves at just the right pace and never gets boring!!Most people have a reasonable idea about the main events of the Cold War but this digs a little deeper and gives you the backstory to what is probably the most fascinating piece of modern history!The film has some brilliant first hand accounts and some brilliant footage of events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union.Highly recommended!,False
21,10,Chilling yet relevant,dfmhanes,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc is chilling-and honestly, way too relevant. It does an incredible job of breaking down how we got here, connecting the Cold War to so much of what's happening today. Watching it, you really get the sense that history isn't just repeating itself-it never actually ended.It's one of those series that should be required viewing in schools. The way it lays everything out makes you see current events in a whole new light. If you want to understand the world we're living in, this is a must-watch.Living in Europe the last 10 years, it all feels that much more on the edge of conversation and the horizon of tomorrow.",False
22,10,Fantastic Documentary,peterwalsh321,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would compare this to ""The World at War"" documentary, which was made in 1973.The difference is this new documentary tells what happens after WW2, right up to the Ukrainian war. The old footage is remarkable to see, it is put together so well and shows the importance of how history can be enjoyed through these television documentaries for infinity.It's the type of series you will find yourself going back to watch again and again. Also you will find you will be telling friends and family who have an interest in history to watch it.Well done to all involved, 8 episodes of brilliant TV 👏👏👍",False
23,9,Required Viewing for Everyone,abbash,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary explores the Cold War and its significant impact on today's world politics, including the current states of Afghanistan and North Korea.The documentary also covers the current war in Ukraine, explaining why it is happening and tracing the events that led to it beginning with the fall of the Soviet Union.I appreciated the unbiased reporting, which highlighted wrongdoings on both sides during the Cold War. It emphasized the paranoia of the US and how close it got to authoritarianism during the McCarthy Era. The documentary provided me with a better understanding of why the US was involved in the governments of so many other countries. I had never grasped the reasons behind America's involvement in foreign nations, orchestrating coups and overthrowing governments.The interviews with world leaders, government officials and individuals directly involved in the events provided valuable insights.Overall, this is an excellent documentary not only about the Cold War but also about the shaping of current world politics.",False
24,6,Quite slanted,frankmannarino,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerAnother slanted Netflix documentary with high production values. Everyone knows Japan was ready to surrender. An invasion of the mainland was unnecessary. Nevermind the Japanese military wasn't ready to surrender even after the second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Ronald Reagan rides the wave of fear of the Soviets into the White House. Korea Air 007 was downed due to the tensions created by the US government and military. They never mentioned that the Soviets secretly recovered the black boxes from Korea Air 007. The Soviets hid them in a vault for a decade.I couldn't make it past episode 5. Interesting but clearly has an agenda.,True
25,5,Decent series derailed by misinformation and bias,kbrenkb,n/a,16/08/2025,"It started out quite well, there certainly was some bias on display in regards to certain ideologies and the actions undertaken during war. However, the last episode was a complete farce; outright stating that Russia was involved in some way in the 2016 US elections, something for which there is no actionable evidence. The fact that Trump is still the boogeyman for so many far left leaning people is shocking to me. You can have your leanings but be honest about what you purport to be factual information to people who don't know.If you're a left wing Ideologue this is probably the show for you. If you value the truth then you may be shocked by what you see.",False

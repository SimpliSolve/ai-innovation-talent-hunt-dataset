1,8,World Star Liv,dakjets,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a Norwegian, I am particularly happy about this documentary series. Because I know that many people in Norway are unfamiliar with Liv Ullmann's long track record. This series deals with her very interesting life in the service of film and theatre. Her transition as a director. As well as her great humanitarian efforts.The series focuses on both her famous achievements (such as Persona) and her more or less unsuccessful American films. It's fun to hear her talk about the action movie she did with Charles Bronson. Liv Ullmann shares with humor and insight about both ups and downs.In the series there are interviews with several colleagues such as Jeremy Irons, Cate Blanchett and John Litglow. They provide insight and fill in the picture of why Liv Ullmann is so great, but it's best when the main character herself speaks and explains. Fortunately, there are also many clips from her long career.For many (especially in Norway) she is best known as one of Ingmar Bergman's favorite actors. And it was Bergman who made her famous, so it's right in a way.At the same time, the series also gives a wider perspective on everything she has undertaken, both as an actor, writer and director. And it is well deserved. Liv Ullmann has qualities as a film actress that are unique to her, and this series gives us some answers as to why we never tire of her.",False
2,8,I knew so little about this cinematic icon!,septimus_millenicom,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is shocking how little I know about Liv Ullmann. For example, this documentary reveals that she was barely 25 when working on _Persona_ (3 years younger than costar Bibi Anderson) when her character is supposed to be so much older! Ullmann is one of those actors who seem to be born whole and entire as a mature artist and never age a day afterwards.Well she does age eventually, and evolves into a graceful writer, director, and humanitarian. As a UNICEF ambassador she has visited 40 countries and given a speech at Clinton's inaugural. She has rubbed shoulders with Nixon in addition to Ingmar Bergman -- and, spiritually, Strindberg, Ibsen, Tolstoy, Tennessee Williams too. It has truly been an extraordinary life.As an actress, Ullmann is known for her unrivalled transparency (as if she has no skin, as Jessica Chastain opines here), the way she can reveal the depth of her characters' soul without say a word. Her supreme intuition, sensitivity, and empathy inform her art and her charity work. In person she can be the opposite of her calm, introspective movie persona; she is surprisingly childlike, airy, constantly mocking herself. At the same time she can be a ""prima donna"" but in a good way (as one of the talking heads claims). There is almost no mention of her acting process or how she interacts on screen with costars.One disappointment I have is that the film omits her recollection of directing _Miss Julie_, which is the most adventurist and formally beautiful work she has done (among those I have seen). I wonder if the version I streamed is truncated (at least 30 minutes shorter than the listed 2+ hour run time). Or if she has become disillusioned with the film's poor reception (looking up her Lincoln Center interviews, she was excited about the film at the time). While Samantha Morton gives a Nordic interpretation, both Jessica Chastain and Colin Ferrell push the maximalism boundary, so different from what she herself might have done. Chastain's work in _Miss Julie_ is arguably one of the greatest in her own storied career. Ullmann and Chastain are such different actresses; Jessica is an intellectual (although she tries to hide it), a self-described ""nerd"" and student of acting who can talk for hours about her craft and the way she works with costars. Perhaps that contrast between the two extraordinary and iconic women is the documentary's most fruitful takeaway.",True

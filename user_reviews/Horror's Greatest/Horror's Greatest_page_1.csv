1,10,It's apolitical and fun for fiends,christinemccloud-87743,n/a,16/08/2025,"Horror is a genre filled with freaks and weirdos and horror fans are, by and large, freaks and weirdos. Mostly nice freaks and weirdos. But if you don't like seeing a few black faces mixed in with white faces and you have a problem with people with vaginas and you suspect some of the speakers may be gay, you may not like it so much. But if you're NOT a hateful troll who can't get a date, you'll probably like it, because it's just a bunch of people who make and love movies talking about must-see horror films in all kinds of subgenres, like Giant Monsters and Japanese Horror and Space Horror. It's not heavy and it's not political. It's fun. It's horror. Lighten up.",False

3,2,Typical 2024 trash,jamespetenbrink-89576,n/a,16/08/2025,I knew not to even give this thing a chance but being a horror fan I decided to. Mistake. It's not about horror films at all it'd just political nonsense. Lea Anderson some brainwashed student actually said Texas Chainsaw Massacre was about capitalism. Then they want to push the black Character always dies which as a life long horror fan I know this is not true. The examples they choice were very weak because it isn't a true troupe. The final girl troupe which obviously is true but one girl said it shouldn't be a final girl that all the women should work together to survive. So I guess in her movies either nobody dies or just the men die. They couldn't have gotten less intelligent people if they tried. This is Hollywood in the 2020s though. Everybody is a victim.,False

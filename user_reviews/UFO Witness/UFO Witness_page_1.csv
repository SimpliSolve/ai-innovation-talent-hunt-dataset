1,7,Not a bad show,deand3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can't avoid comparing this one with Unidentified: Inside America's UFO Investigation. While the creators of Unidentified choose to focus on a recent history and specific set of witnesses and interviewees (current and ex military and gov agencies employees), UFO Witness has much richer history to explore and wider circle of mostly credible witnesses and interviewees.UFO Witness partially relays on Project Blue Book, their archive and it's former investigator Jennie Zeidman. I found that a great choice because PBB is a treasure cove of credible and unexplainable ufo cases.
They also explore more recent sightings, government coverup, alien tech and related gov programs and more.Biggest minus for me is tempo, too often they rush through cases and topics that deserve much more examination. Overdramatization could be also taken down a notch but it's not insufferable.Worth a watch, 6.8",False
2,6,BACKGROUND MUSIC,alb-57868,n/a,16/08/2025,The background music is way too loud and very annoying. PLEASE STOP. Most of the program it is difficult the hear people speaking. I stopped watching because of the loud background music.,False
3,7,Interesting content...atrocious production.,kqjgzmn,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a former journalist, and now Information Technology professional at a major research university, I appreciate the attempt to be fact-based, and the compelling content. But good gawd...I'm also a musician, and whoever did the audio mixing needs to be immediately fired...it makes the series almost unwatchable. So much absolutely unnecessary ""dramatic/cinematic"" noise that it makes hearing the actual dialogue almost impossible at times. My wife and I saw something we can't explain the the skies of Southern Illinois for over 45 minutes a few years ago and we'd like to know more about this phenomenon...I don't need the nonstop, inane cinematic scoring drowning out what everyone is saying. Whoever mixed the audio needs to find a new profession.",False
4,n/a,Good Watching BUT !,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoy the program BUT , The background music is always so loud that you can hardly make out what the people being interviewed are saying ! Come-on , trun down the music !",False
5,7,To Serve Mankind,L_Garou,n/a,16/08/2025,"It gets a 7 for the genre alone which people are starving for. Also the personal credibility with the early on (40s, 50s) military family connection and the real life people. Everyday people are sooo much more believable than celebrity egoists. Hey, we're not in the 20th century anymore, Toto. The real 21st century question these days might as well be . . . Who hasn't seen a UFO?",False
6,9,Best UFO TV Show In Many Years,AudioFileZ,n/a,16/08/2025,"UFO Witness is a solid new UFO show. The host is good without theatrics and useless experiments like clogged UFO Hunters. Concentrating on actual witnesses in both known and unknown UFO events is key to keeping things very real. I was ready to write-off UFO TV productions, but this one was truly interesting. I hope it can continue and dive ever deeper.",False
7,6,Real bad sound,d_keenan1,n/a,16/08/2025,"The program is better than most ufo programs, but the background music is simply to high. In some parts of the program you'll find it very hard to hear when the people are being interviewed. Just a pity as the program is good.",False
8,2,Meh... not bad but there's a few dumb problems I have like this...,Sean_Biggins,n/a,16/08/2025,"He goes to the Dulce Indian reservation in New Mexico and claims there is maybe a UFO base at the top of the mountain (which is easily scalable) where the aliens are experimenting on humans and cattle etc, but then he stops half way up the mountain and gives up? ...WTF is with that? Obviously there's no ufo base up there at all -- just some microwave towers and electronic crap. He claims there's 'plumes' of heat coming from the top of the mountain but my dad did diesel installations like that during the cold war in the 1950's and there are engines that run all the time supplying the the power to the equipment, so if there is heat being kicked off, then it could just be fumes from generators running. But my point is, why not just go the hell up there and confirm it? I just found that whole angle RIDICULOUS because the very first thing he should have done was to go up there and see WTH is going on but instead, the show ends with him 'wondering' what might be up there. How bloody stupid.",False
9,8,"Ignore the haters, it's a good show!",XxXhAcKeRXxX,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just ignore what these haters think about this show and how they whine about it. This is a good show for those who love watching shows like Ancient Aliens, Unidentified: Inside America's UFO Investigation, etc. Watched 6 episodes so far and probably 1 episode was not that interesting but the other 5 episodes was interesting to watch.",False
10,6,This could have been a really interesting show.......,ucantfoolmez,n/a,16/08/2025,"This could be an interesting show but the ""end of the world"" drama from the host and the loud suspenseful type music is ridiculous. It would have been great if it was more like an actual documentary instead of it turning out to seem like a stupid ""crazy conspiracy"" type show. It is awesome that they have actual eye witnesses but their stories are never documented in full.....just poorly edited cut up bits. LET US HEAR THE WITNESSES STORIES IN FULL. Now I believe in UFOs. I have seen one myself but this show does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to change anyone's mind from them believing it is all a bunch of ""crazy conspiracy freaks"". It is nothing but poor filming and directing........a real shame.",False
11,4,Poor Production Decisions!!,heratyplant,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting new show, in a crowded sector, with some strong witnesses, hence the title & good evidence, even if we have seen some of it before, the stories are told well, the presenter is engaging & with his own backstory to add weight to the show.However, this is all marred for me, as we listen to 'actual' testimony from UFO witnesses with dramatic, not-so-background music, & idiotically devoid of subtitles!! I could barely hear 10% of what was being said, just a muffled voice & loud music. Why was the commentary not transcribed into subtitles, it seems so obvious that this is required, the omission is just beyond belief.Upon watching other episodes, loud music over muffled old recordings happens over & OVER again; such a shame as they're really interesting people talking, it's like an intern is making production decisions on this show. Dramatic music is fine, but not when it's a louder than the most important thing on the show - witnesses telling their story - ridiculous!!The vast choice of things to watch in the 21st century, means that there is simply no room for schoolboy errors such as this & it damages enjoyment of this otherwise fascinating subject matter.",False
12,8,UFO potential threat?,franckmhd,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like this show as I'm eager to learn but a bit too intense and dramatic.Like it is said, reports of UFO are from centuries ago. So why talking about imminent potential threat?What are they waiting to attack? What reason they have not yet done it?I do understand people suffering if they think they were abducted by aliens.But why the aliens let them go alive after the abduction? To talk about it in TV shows?Is it part of the invasion plan?Based on the witnesses reports, aliens technology seems well advanced. But still no clear communication to the people from earth? Why?Just wondering.But it's good to have such shows and investigation done, just wish one guest could challenge some comments during the show.",False
13,6,"Im not saying its aliens, but....",anthonyvetaas,n/a,16/08/2025,"(Based on 2 first episodes)Thank something that there are actually some UFO docuseries that have an actual investigative approach.Very interesting the people interviewed, most of them credible eyewitnesses, ex officials, and ex US military personnel. The host himself also presents himself as serious, and investigative, even though he clearly believes.Also interesting to hear about some of the actual cases fictionalized in TV series ""Project Blue Book"".The negative? The usual sensation/dramatic commentary, and sound/music effects that follows most (""reality"")shows coming from the US/Canada.",False
14,3,Music is horrible,cyndieishman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Good program, wish they would turn down the volume on.the background music. Makes it hard to actually hear what they are saying. It's called ""background music "" for a reason!.",False
15,6,"Starts Strong, Loses Momentum.",drisley-72230,n/a,16/08/2025,"I will say that the presentation of this series is above average for the UFO genre. The series starts strong with some good new evidence, and really peaks in Ep 3.But after that, things start to go downhill and I often find that they are really ""reaching"" to try to connect various cases.I fell asleep during the final two episodes.I actually enjoyed Aliens In Alaska more than this.",False
16,10,A must watch,emojiekdost,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great series, One should watch it to see the reality which government has hided from us since years",False
17,6,Nancy Lieder,lulucrerar,n/a,16/08/2025,Just wanted to ask .... why has No-one contacted nancy.,False
18,3,Typical us V. them BS,jhorva,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ugh. So tired of the USA mentality of ""It's us versus them!! Yee haw!!""
Just beause aliens might be real it doesn't mean they would act the same way humans do, pretty sure if they've achieved FTL technology their probably also light years ahead in their brain functions. This show just keeps the cycle of aliens being bad guys going and it's pretty tiresome. Maybe try some originality once in a while.",False
19,9,Igone the haters,parmaanalam,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerIt's totally great show. Great real stories. Not showing real aliens but imagination was good and many times real ufo shows. You can watch and enjoy it. I am sure you can love them this show.,True
20,6,Research,dlonghurst-28194,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're hosting a show about UFO sightings, shouldn't you do research on the subject? He asked someone on a case if he'd ever heard of governments or military attempting to cover up or dismiss claims of sightings before. He was genuinely shocked when he heard the answer. Seriously? Were you born yesterday? It's a commonly known fact you could hear from the average guy on the street. The media has been conned for decades to help with the smear campaign. Shouldn't you have done research on this aspect of the subject you're supposedly investing? At least watch another show on the subject? Hell, watch the X-FILES! You also did an experiment with swamp gas, which was laughingly used as an explanation for the sightings. You failed to point out that swamp gas doesn't spontaneously combust. You need to work harder.",False
21,2,Background Music/Noise!!!,tadted,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tried watching this but it's difficult to make out the dialogue because of the ""dramatic"" background noises drowning it out. The guy doing the investigation is a bit ""hammy"" too but I could put up with that if it didn't have the unnecessary noise.",False
22,8,Good show with some unfortune choices,lostangelz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been into the subject ever since I was a kid (48 now). Doesn't mean I believe everything that is being said. I'm incredibly picky. I need some kind of proof, credible witnesses, preferably multiple witnesses and what have you. There are so many ludicrous stories out there, so many misidentifications (planet, meteor, sundogs, planes, insects... I can go on and on.)I like how Ben Hansen talks with the guests in the show; calm, easy and comforting.What I don't like, and many have mentioned this already, is the over-dramatic and too loud background music. And then the audiotapes, completely inaudible.What bothers me most is the voiceover, talking about threats, invasions, attacks and malevolent aliens, based on absolutely nothing. It's just sensationalizing done wrong. Why always look for a new enemy? They have never shot down one of our planes, destroyed something or killed anyone. Really, lose the voiceover and the threat narrative.All things considered I feel this is still a good show. It's Ben who makes it good. I'm starting episode 6 of season 2 now. I hope for less threat scares and more videos, documents, stories and maybe something I haven't already seen or heard in my decades of reading books and watching shows about UFOs/UAPs.@ The producers and all involved: For a possible next season, p.l.e.a.s.e.(!!!) lose the voiceover. Seriously.#EyesOnTheSkies.",False
23,3,"Loud background music, too loud!",tsimshianman,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am watching some early episodes for the first time. The frustration I am experiencing prompted me to find somewhere online to voice my frustration about how the show is produced. The loud music drowns out people talking. It is inappropriate and distracting me from following the stories. I was not surprised to see many reviews on here that make the same point. How on earth can that noise be approved let alone entertaining?So Now. You won't let. Me post this. Because there aren't enough characters?So I must add more to make you happy.What a waste of time doing this. There, are you happy?",False
24,9,Truth or Falsehood - what do they represent.,astrohog,n/a,16/08/2025,"The alien agenda, who are they and what they want. They are not what people think they are, there actions give them away. Logic dictates, why would a highly advanced race treat another intelligent race like lab rats? I believe they wouldn't so who are they? Our world and the human race have a spiritual connection with God. The Bible tells anyone who wants to read it who they are and want they want. What do they want? The destruction of humanity and slavery. They are masters of the LIE and the truth is not in their actions. Do not believe them, they will tell you what you want to hear which Is a lie. They are not aliens from another planet wishing us good will and bringing humanity help. They serve another master with evil intentions and will demand submission or deal . The TRUTH is out there and it's in the Bible.",False
25,3,We're they even in the Ozarks?,mrburrfoot,n/a,16/08/2025,I've lived in the Ozarks most of my life. Grew up in Springfield mo. Nothing they showed was in mo the mountains in the back ground are not the Ozarks this show and the host are just Hollywood drama Queens that will say anything for a paycheck and the so called ex FBI agent just more proof that cop's Lie. I promise this is not Springfield mo. I've noticed a lot of other garbage this host has said he is either very stupid or he is selling his soul for a Hollywood paycheck. He claims that a 1964 lunar lander would not have radiation. He finds evidence he never investigates the guy ignores all the facts but then that is what cops do. They lie.,False

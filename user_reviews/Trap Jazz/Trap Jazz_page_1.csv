1,4,HuLu does it again!,mrz_nr1,n/a,16/08/2025,Trap Jazz is a documentary film directed by Sad√© Clacken Joseph that follows Atlanta musicians behind some of the biggest names in music who embark on an uncertain journey into the spotlight with a new genre of music that fuses trap music with jazz12. The film is produced by Hulu and will be released on August 23rd 20232.The film is probably one of the best Hulu productions to date. So I guve it a 4 of 10! The movie has poor acting from recycled mainstream actors who do not fit the roles or deliver the emotions. The movie has poor casting choices that do not match the characters or the story.,False
2,9,Outstanding documentary on a new musical movement,awcollis,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't understand the review just before mine because they said something about actors... there are no actors in this movie. Because it is a documentary, I fine one at that. It has a lot of heart. A lot of soul. And a great sense of style that works well with the subject matter. Beautifully shot. Edited in a way that keeps you feeling the journey of the main characters. And the music is outstanding.I saw it with a huge crowd, and everybody loved it. Laughing at all the right places. Crying too. The subject matter is really unique in that a melding of hip hop and jazz is very new. Most of all, the characters and their families are just great. Check it out. (And you should watch it alone just to see this high school jazz instructor who is just wonderful and hysterical.)",False

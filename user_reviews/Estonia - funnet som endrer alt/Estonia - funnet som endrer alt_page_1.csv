1,10,Documentary of the year,simonsafferson,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you haven't watched it yet, go right ahead. This is by far one of the best documentaries I have ever watched and very interesting to see how the goverment of Sweden tried to cover up the truth for so long.It will be almost impossible for them to rely on the old rapport once these new discoveries have been made.There are some follow up questions that I think should be addressed:Why did military equipment transport on an civil ferry from old Soviet countries to Sweden?Why did the timeline of the witnesses on the boat and the timeline that responsible ministry not match up? Did they not believe that the passengers onboard were capable of making their own predictions of time?Why did the Swedish goverment spend 300 million SEK of tax payer money to cement the entire ferry?There are clearly more questions to be asked but the big issue with all of this is that there is not enough transparency from the goverments side. Either you reveal the truth to the people or conspiracy theories will grow bigger and bigger as time goes on.Set the truth free.",True
2,10,Thats the abolute top quality You get when You research the content 15 years,hannes-maasing,n/a,15/08/2025,"The director Henrik Evartson who is now in Sweden under criminal invetigation because of the making this documentary (first time in Scandinavian history) have put 15 years his life, his passion, his energy and his time into this. The result is documentary with abolute top quality what characterizes with 5 words:
Genuine. Precise. Sad. Shaking. True.
Especially when covernment of country - Estonia under whos flag the ferry sails, calls up the new investigation even with possibilty to take wreck up. Thats the work of lifetime. Thats when You get the documentary what are talking about hundreds, thousends and tens of thousands people. years later. Absolute briliant work.",False
3,10,Amazing storytelling through 5 episodes!,quistrosen,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first 2 episodes starts out fairly slow and lets you in on the story of the M/S Estonia incident and what happened in the eye of the public. As the documentary proceeds, the 3 coming episodes unveil dark thruths about the decisions the Swedish goverment made to try and hold back the truth from reaching the public.Netflix is sleeping on this one.",False
4,10,The Best I have seen,framboise-8,n/a,15/08/2025,So well done documentary and you see how much efforts its put in this to give answers to survivors!,False
5,10,Absolutely amazing,jkf-12583,n/a,15/08/2025,Probably the best documentary I've ever seen. I take my hat off for this. Something everyone needs to see!,False
6,10,Absolutely fantastic,deame-ltd,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fantastic piece of investigative journalism. An investigation that cuts deep to the core, and battles to expose the truth. Through very tough aversion tactics, that so many people believe is just too insane to believe.What a tribute to the 852 loved and lost.Rated hundreds of shows/movies on IMDB. This is first review. Enough said!",False
7,10,Amazing piece of investigative journalism,gsharmaind,n/a,15/08/2025,"5 episodes, so amazingly pieced together to investigate which might be one of the most deceptive coverups in the European history. Being a non-european, it boggles my mind how the Europeans who lost their loved ones got deceived by their own governments who claimed to follow the 'law of land'.",False
8,10,Amazing doc,johannahenriksson-21710,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary highlighted a catastrophe that I've always heard of growing up but never really knew what happened.
The storytelling, that was fantastic, together with the amazing photography made the film something special.Hope Netflix buys this film so more people get the opportunity to watch it.",False
9,10,Amazing!,DaggerDan,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an amazong piece of work.
It is very hard to watch because of all the feelings that appear, but it is time to find out the truth!",False
10,10,The best documentary I've ever seen,kevin-166-337466,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was born i 1995, over 1 year after Estonia, I don't have a relative who died in Estonia, I don't have any connection to it whatsoever. The only thing is that I am from Sweden. I have been well versed in how the swedish government lies and deceives just about everyone as soon as they get a chance, but even I had no idea they were this disgusting and downright evil.Without a doubt the most shocking and frightening documentary I've ever seen. Everyone has to see this. Don't imagine that Sweden is some sort of democratic heaven with rule of law. It isn't. Now my country is attempting to imprison journalists for actually doing their job (which they almost never do).The swedish government seems to have only scorn and contempt for its citizens and for the ones who died that tragic day in 1994. It has always been the bane of my existence that swedes are so servile and just accept to be spat on and humiliated. I really wish everyone would watch this documentary and realize that Sweden is no less corrupt than, say, Putin's Russia.",False
11,9,Fantastic journalism,oldie-butgoodie-391-56522,n/a,15/08/2025,"This captivated me right from the beginning. This was an event I had heard of but, knew nothing about. Really brilliant journalism üëè with huge research and large number of people from all sides given the opportunity to give their side.",False
12,1,So.. what exactly is the truth..?,chocolateslut,n/a,15/08/2025,"What complete and utter shait. No proof of anything and no thing to back up any claims either. This is an utter breach of journalistic ethics.
The boys made up the title before actually starting with any research or filming. This becomes a bit of a problem when there's really nothing to tell. So one must make up remarkable conspiracies and unbelievable fairytales to entertain.
And entertain they do, because people buy to watch entertainment- because this is entertainment, not journalistics. The sad thing is, many people tend to forget the difference between a remarkable story and truth. A rule of thumb is to think: ""remarkable stories require remarkable evidence"".
This sci-fi story calling itself a documentary doe not give evidence, let alone explanation.",False
13,10,Game changing,steph-29867,n/a,15/08/2025,"To Chocolateslut, I can only surmise you are, despite your user name old school USSR (or pining for such times). Never been tempted to write a review before, and certainly not one for conspiracy theories normally. Absolutely fantastic viewing. Watched as I had seen a previous documentary which not only excepted the bow doors theory, but went to great depths to justify the conclusion. How shameful that our European intelligence services have covered this up (although many would add to be expected - anything to protect the secrets likely to destroy a 'democratic' country). Watch this, you feel almost every tired but still passionate emotion of all those involved - survivours, family members, politicians (with credibility), specialists and journalists. Please let justice be served. Well done Henrik.",False
14,10,Best documentary ever!,ashratempel-62893,n/a,15/08/2025,"10 stars!!! This documentary is off the chain! 5k quality, good old material, interviews with survivors etc",False
15,9,Top notch M/S Estonia documentary,hrsowhat,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentaries about the Estonia catastrophe before this one hasn't revealed anything at all about what could have happened that night of the ""accident"", they only left us with even more questions than before. This documentary on the other hand confirms that we weren't overreacting with conspiracies to lay the blame on someone just out of frustration. Here you'll see that foul play actually could be the reason for the ship to sink and not just by an random accident.This is a must-watch documentary for all of you that have had an interest in the M/S Estonia catastrophe the last 25 years.",False
16,10,The Swedes are cold man.,dhooley-12359,n/a,15/08/2025,"This really puts into perspective why the Swedish government didn't do a total lockdown during COVID-19 to protect their vulnerable citizens, their motto seems to be 'if they die they die' they endangered they lives of almost a 1000 human beings and let 852 dead loved ones just rot at the bottom of the ocean. Just cover their asses. Wow.",False
17,10,Single best investigative documentary I've seen,bjorckman-72653,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a shocking, relevant and extremely thoroughly put together documentary series about the sinking of the M/S Estonia in 1994 and the continuous mysteries and controversies surrounding the accident and its aftermath.The collection and assembly of source material is absolutely immaculate, and the score is one of the best examples of music perfectly matched to images and story you will find in the genre.Not only is this top-tier documentary as far as the craft goes, what is by far most impressive is the bravery of the production in serving public interest. The sacrifices they have made (two members of the team have stood trial and faced conviction in Sweden directly related to the production) in search of the truth are heroic.This is the single best investigate documentary I have ever seen.",False

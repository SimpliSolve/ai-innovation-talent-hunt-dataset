1,n/a,"Supposedly anti-consumerist ""Anarchy-lite"" for fake hipster consumers",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"The identity of Robin Gunningham, aka ""Banksy"" hasn't been a secret for many years now. He signed his early works, including cassette-tape album graphics as Gunningham at the beginning of his career. And several of his buddies from his early graffiti career have confirmed his identity. His name also appears on court documents having to do with trademark and lastly the movements of Gunningham correspond to the appearance of Banksy works. (interesting that a person who wears his ""anarchism"" on his sleeve, and doesn't believe other people should profit from their intellectual property has several times sued people for using his in copyright cases. The supposed mystery and claim of anonymity is a obvious fake hype. That is another irony. This ""artist"" is all about hype and consumerism while claiming to be anti consumerism. The wealthy consumers who buy his art and a few hundred million worth have been sold, are his audience. He also complain that some of his work has been painted over by other artists, when he painted over other artists early in his career.""Most wanted"" has the look and feel of a PR piece. Essentially a long mind numbing infomercial.",False

1,4,A bit contrived,mcoats-71101,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not a fan of Real but nor do I dislike them - I support a team in England's 2nd division so have never even met them in a game! But I was naturally interested in this documentary to see what life was like at this huge and mythical club and to hear what some of the legends of the game had to say.Of course it was all scripted and contrived from the very first scene. The bunch of legends playing table football, in slow motion, with lots of fake laughter and then having an 'impromptu' sit down chat....all put together by a video agency who have probably never even played the game.There is some good footage but if you want a rosy view of a big club, with loads of talking heads, using soft focus camera lenses and dramatic music then this is for you - but if you wanted just a proper multi sided documentary about the club then this isn't it.",False

1,9,Absolutely loved it,brightness-69347,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved seeing the behind the scenes of Jungkook's solo journey even though it was heartbreaking seeing how sick he was for a lot of it & how rushed his short promotion period was. He worked so hard last year and knowing that he saw how loved he is was very comforting and reassuring.My only complaint was that some of the footage seemed very rushed and therefore it was a bit difficult to follow. It would also have been great to see more of the recording process. There were also some crediting problemsOverall it was a very enjoyable, if emotional, viewing though. I hope to be able to watch again.",False

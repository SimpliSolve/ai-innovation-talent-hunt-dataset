1,6,Not Much New On The Mothman,wandernn1-81-683274,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bizarre. There's actually a Mothman museum??? I remember seeing the Mothman Prophecies at the theater, the Richard Gere movie. Is there really a 'Moth Man' in Point Pleasant??I guess it's an update sort of on the Legend of the Moth Man. Not a lot of new information however. 6/10",False
2,1,The Mothman Legacy: More fiction,Platypuschow,n/a,16/08/2025,"PlotA documentary about the Mothman phenomenon. A direct sequel to The Mothman of Point Pleasant (2017).CastMade by Seth Breedlove, a man with a penchant for the absurd. From Mothman, to Aliens to Sasquatch he's done a documentary for each.VerdictThe Mothman Legacy is the same as it's predecessor The Mothman of Point Pleasant (2017) as if one of these wasn't enough. Namely it's full of interviews with people who claim to have seen ""Something"", a lot of speculation, a history lesson and some credits.You see the moment this ""Documentary"" began I was hit with an advert. No, I mean there's actually an advert as part of the documentary instantly after the credits. Bad start! Never seen something so absurdly unprofessional.And then it begins and it's everything you'd expect from a documentary about something wholly fictional. Local yokels ranting about what they saw but never caught it on camera, local ""Experts"" who also can't provide anything but alleged background and references to Hollywood movies that feature this fictional creature.Seriously, do you not have anything better to do?RantsThe Mothman doesn't exist
Ghosts aren't a thing
Sasquatch is fictional
Aliens aren't probing buttsDo I need to continue? Grow up and engage with reality.BreakdownFascinating creature
Boring
Accomplishes nothing
Fiction dressed as fact.",False
3,1,"Endless babble, no new information",taedirish,n/a,16/08/2025,"My first impression of this was that it seemed pretentious. The 10 minute long intro had me immediately questioning my decision to watch. If you know nothing of mothman and don't mind an overly dramatic and a loquacious narrator, you might find this an alright experience but otherwise I'd strongly recommend passing on this one.",False

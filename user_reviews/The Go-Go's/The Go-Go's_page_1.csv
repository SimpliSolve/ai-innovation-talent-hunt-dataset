1,7,Terrible pacing by the director. So disappointed.,brandonsmuxx,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first 45 minutes focus on their formation, punk roots, and breaking through. It's excellent..but it also ruined the film. Let me explain.. 45 minutes in, the focus is on Beauty and the Beat. That's great. Loving it. But then you realize you're halfway through the film. The casual fan/viewer won't see a problem. As a hard-core fan, however, you'll be wondering how the director can possibly do justice to the rest of their history. She can't. The 2nd and 3rd albums, the turmoil, Jane leaving, and the breakup are all crammed into about 30 minutes. Worse, so much isn't even mentioned. Belinda's solo success? About 2 sentences and a picture of the Heaven album. The 1990 reunion? No mention. God Bless the Go Go's? Nope. I could go on and on. Instead, we immediately jump from 1985 to 2000. Next? About 3 minutes later, we jump from 2000 to 2020. No mention of literally anything during that 20 year gap. You then get some final thoughts, hear their new song, and the credits roll.
Bottom line:
To casual or new eyes, you'll probably love it. Maybe that is what the intention was.
To dedicated fans, you will 100% be disappointed.
The solution, because of the slow and detailed formula used for the first 45 minutes, would demand the film to be well over 2 hours.
But, would the casual viewer want another hour? Unlikely.
The length and how the director chose to allocate the time was a formula for disaster. HOWEVER..let me be clear..the first 45 minutes are incredible. The problem is that the film needed about 90 more minutes because of those slow-burn, thorough 45 minutes.
This would have been an INCREDIBLE 2 or 3 part documentary. As it stands, you have an amazing 45 minutes followed by an incomplete, rushed, and frustrating 2nd half of the film.
10/10 for the band, though. Maybe a director's cut will be released..I don't see it fixing the problem, however.",False
2,7,Brave to Show Huge Flaws and All,quitwastingmytime,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was pretty brave of them to trash the image that was sold to the public in the 80s. Pure bubblegum pop, presented as fun close friends, almost a Monkees for the 80s.IRL they constantly fought. The singer had a huge ego. The main songwriter was a junkie who almost died. The other songwriter was bipolar and suicidal. All of them were heavy drinkers and drug users and had their share of guy groupies.That's much of the appeal. It's like an extended Behind the Music episode where you find out the Partridge Family had drug problems and the singer hated his father and being a sex symbol. The Go Gos hated the happy smiley front they had to put on.Some of the pretensions and claims made by the doc and band are laughable. Best selling girl group? The Supremes. The first to play their own instruments? Runaways, for rock. Actually there were all female jazz groups since the 40s.First all women punk rock group? The Slits. Really the list of accomplished famous and influential women musicians better than them is long, going all the way back to Odetta and Maybelle Carter in the 20s.And the Go Gos were never punk for the year and a half they claimed to be. They were just barely new wave. They hung around the early scene, played three song sets, and could barely play at all by their own account. But their songs had none of the anger of punk, and they were already pop by the time the scene turned hardcore.In some ways they were posers. You hear them talking about ""England where punk began."" Are they kidding? Never heard of the Ramones, Dictators, MC5, or Stooges? Or for that matter, punk goddess Patti Smith.So yes, ""successful pop girl group in the 80s for four years."" They definitely don't deserve the RNR Hall of Fame. But it is interesting to watch them tear apart their own good girl image.",True
3,7,Good Overview But Pretty Standard Rock Doc,SteveHerold,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was really looking forward to this one. I had read some good things about it and was stoked to find it already available on Showtime app ahead of its August premiere. It's a good film but really nothing more than the standard rock doc. Without insulting the film it gives you exactly what you would get back in the day on an episode of Behind The Music. It feels like some history is glossed over or skipped entirely (no mention of God Bless The Go-Go's.... Why?) I'd love to see a director's cut of this. I'm not suggesting the Go-Go's need some crazy 4-hour long career examination like the films about Petty, Eagles and Rush but they certainly warrant another 30 minutes or so. It was nice seeing original band members interviewed and it's hard not to feel bad for original manager Ginger who Jane probably rightfully suggests they should've stuck with. Worth a view for sure but here's hoping maybe a longer version will see the light of day in the future.",False
4,n/a,A lot of glossing over......,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Showtime does subpar documentaries in comparison to their rival, HBO, but this one was okay. Just a lot of glossing over relevant information. So, Charlotte has a massive drug problem. How about you tell us HOW that was and how it affected everything and everyone around her? Band members repeatedly state Charlotte was out of control, even saying, ""She was so out of control, Ozzy Osbourne banned her from his dressing room."" And that's it. No details, whatsoever. Now THAT'S a story everyone would want to hear. Outside of those details, it was fun watching all the footage of these adorable cutie pies. I didn't realize how many of their songs I actually knew, probably because they appeared on so many movies and tv commercials. Worth a watch if you're an 80's baby and general music fan.",False

6,6,Rollicking documentary doubles as HOF application statement,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Go-Go's"" (2020 release; 98 min.) is a documentary about ""the most successful female rock band of all time"". As the movie opens, we are reminded (for the first, but not the last, time) that the Go-Go's are the only all-female rock band to write and perform their own songs who scored a Billboard No. 1 album. We then go to ""Los Angeles, 1979"" as the local punk scene is small but ferocious and a number of the eventual Go-Go girls are very much a part of it (check the footage and photos of Jane Wiedlin attending a show at the Masque). We then turn to Belinda Carlisle as she too came up through the SoCal punk scene. ""The punk scene was safe and welcoming"" she comments. ""You don't know what you are doing? Just do it!"" At this point we are 10 min. into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from long-time documentarian Allison Ellwood. Here she brings the story of the Go-Go's, very much like those erstwhile VH-1 ""Behind the Music"" episodes. The documentary's first 45 min. are absolutely flawless, benefiting from the amazing amount of archive footage and pcitures from the early days. The band's first (1980) tour of the UK (opening for the Specials and Madness) gets ample attention, and rightfully so. Equally transfixing is the band's evolution from punk to new wave to pop. Confesses Charlotte Caffey (on writing ""We Got the Beat""): ""I was sacred. I thought the girls would throw me out of the band for writing a pop song."" Absolute genius! The band's meteoric rise is as dazzling as it is dizzying (reaching No. 1 on the Billboard album chart with their 1981 debut album). They would never achieve such heights again. The second half of this documentary isn't nearly as compelling as, predictably, it focuses on the band's in-fighting, drug addictions and ultimate demise (and return). The biggest flaw, or annoyance, of this film, though, is the repeated pleas to get the Go-Go's in the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame. Do they belong? For sure. But hitting you over the head with this in a documentary isn't really the way to go.""The Go-Go's"" premiered a few days ago on Showtime, and is now available on SHO On Demand, Amazon Instant Video and other streaming platforms. If you are a fan of the Go-Go's from back in the day, or simply are a music fan, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
7,10,Loved this documentary!,cody-fein,n/a,15/08/2025,Always loved them and their music. But now I love the band and their achievements.,False
8,7,Good ...,Reviewer99,n/a,15/08/2025,"Enjoyed hearing their their insights about the the LA Punk scene and their first UK Tour when they were starting out. After that there was little new information except for the amount of drug use they admitted too and the firing of their original manager.Seven years together, four albums, followed by intermittent reunions ... sorry ladies, but wait your turn for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",False
9,10,We Got the Beat,Screen_O_Genic,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fun, zany, colorful, glitzy, girly and of course rocking like the girls themselves, ""The Go-Go's"" is Rock n' Roll itself told from the female perspective. The first all-girl band to play their instruments and write their own songs to hit the top of the charts the band are prime for a tribute and a telling of their legacy and they do it compellingly. Chronicling their origins from troubled teens to honing their musical chops in the L.A. Punk scene to superstardom the cool ladies relate their story belying their senior years retaining the verve and energy of their youth. The tales of success, drugs, sex, infighting and of course great music bring your great Rock n' Roll tale with a cute and feminine touch. Priceless footage and images of the band throughout their career and the topnotch music make this a feast for the senses. Interviews from their peers and associates highlight the impact the girls had on the music scene at the time. Just like the gals and their music this doc is a well-paced no filler all killer tribute to arguably the greatest female Rock band and a visual and musical document on a great time and the individuals who made it so.",False
10,6,"From ""punk"" to major label Sellouts",buzzknutson,n/a,15/08/2025,I mean the documentary isn't bad but some of the content makes you sick to your stomach. Somehow they thought they were special when all they really amounted to was another cookie cutter pop band in the 80s. It is interesting listening to how their first major label picked them up based on image (didn't care if they were good) and then made them change their sound (oh all of our songs are pop songs when we play them slower). I mean anything can be a pop song if it's played like a pop song lol.Also the way they talked about being misfits and finding each other (family) really seems like a bunch of hogwash when in the next scene they kick out members for no better reason then money and fame.The whole mess just seems like the brain washed ramblings of a band that once had an impact. Also the pacing of the documentary is horrendous. With proper editing it could have been much better (stylistically not it's content).,False
11,8,band doc,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a documentary about the 80's girl band which broke some glass ceilings and ends up breaking up themselves. When band members make their own doc or biopic, one is always concerned about the truthfulness or any slanting of reality. They do bang the drum hard on their groundbreaking nature. It's a well earned badge but maybe they hit it too many times. As for the truth, they don't skip their drug-taking or the infighting. In that sense, they are relatively truthful. The years have mellowed them and given them introspection. That probably helps. At its core, this band fell into the same traps as most others whether girls or not. They may have run into different issues but the road they traveled on are very familiar. Also, they have some fun songs.",False
12,7,"OK, we get it, you were punks at one point ...",smithnumber,n/a,15/08/2025,"I liked the Go-Gos as much as anyone back in the day, but really, they were no more than a come and go band that played catchy music for a couple of years in the 80s - like many other bands at the time. Having said that, this doco really does create a really interesting exploration of the foundations of the band. They all seem to rabbit on about what great rebels they were and what crazy punk stuff they did, but that's not why they became famous. It was their American pop princess music and image that got them there. It has all the usual elements of pop band life - kicking people out, drugs, jealousy and fights over royalties. It's a very familiar tale, but still interesting to watch.So why is there still some interest in this band after all these years? I basically think that it was because Belinda Carlyle cleaned up, became super hot, had a few hits and this helped maintain an interest in the band. They also tour every now and then and really emphasize the punk/party animal aspect of their lives which is ultimately more interesting than the popular music they produced. As for their campaign to get inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, it will probably happen, proving that anything is possible if you hang around long enough and change your narrative to whatever is fashionable at the time.",False
13,3,Punk Wannabes Turned Pop Stars,chas437,n/a,15/08/2025,"Knowing a lot about the late-70s early 80s LA Punk music, I did a lot of cringing during this documentary. The Go-Go's didn't have much if any punk credibility. They were laughed at, spit on, etc., and it wasn't just ""White Nationalist"" skin heads, it was most in the punk scene. They might say it was misogynistic white men ridiculing them, but the fact was they weren't a good punk band, they were just the first all female act. That's it.The Go-Go's were first and foremast a pop act that grew in fame with MTV in the early 80s. They were a gimmick act in the eyes of many, They weren't professional musicians, in fact, outside of Charlotte Caffey, they could barely play their instruments.They did do a lot of drugs, so there's that. Belinda Carlisle's decades long coke habitat isn't even mentioned here. I have the feeling that many things were left out in this revisionist documentary.So, they were the first all female band that actually wrote and performed their own songs. That's at least something. They didn't make a lot of music, but I'll say one thing in their favor, there are worse acts in the Rock and Roll HoF.",False
14,n/a,The rise and fall (and rise?) of the Go-Gos,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Alison Ellwood's (Laurel Canyon) Documentary does a pretty fair job of covering the story of the all-girl band who made good in the early 80s. It's an authorized Doc with the full participation of all five main members, but they do speak pretty openly of their the squabbles and feuds which led to their breaking up after only three albums. Two founding band members who were fired before they hit the big-time are also given time to speak their minds, as is the group's original manager who was forced out when they were at their peak of fame. Still, there are obvious gaps in the storytelling (including a major lawsuit by bassist Kathy Valentine that kept her out of the band's reunion shows for a few years), and while the two guitarists, Jane Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey, talk openly about their personal issues, singer Belinda Carlisle is very circumspect. Gina Schock is refreshingly candid.
As someone who was a big fan of the band when they hit the scene, there's a sense of sadness about band's story. For a band who's music and public image was all big and bouncy, one comes away feeling that they didn't enjoy their couple of years of fame. Sure, the sex, drugs and booze standard rock 'n roll rise and fall story applies to many bands, but, the Go-Gos rise and fall tale seems to have happened on speed dial. Indeed, the unspoken message here is that it was their comet-like rise to the top that caused them to crash and burn even that much more rapidly. They were the first all woman band to play their own instruments to have a Number One album (and still are!!), but the pressure to cash-in on that newfound fame caused jealousies and divisions within the band and accentuated Wiedlin and Caffey's personal demons to the breaking point.
Still, for all the turmoil, Ellwood shows that the women have patched things up. The band also shows personal photos of the good times they had together. They do seem to be, if not content now, at least more at peace with themselves - and each other. And, their new song, 'Club Zero' ain't half bad, either.",False
15,9,Perfect retrospective,mfouts-02268,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'd been waiting to see this for a while, cause I like the directors other docs. This was everything I'd hoped for. Nothing really new, but it's fun and complete.Highly recommended for new fans of the group. It's also a trip for old fans.",False
16,7,We ask too much of bands,frukuk,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watch this if you want to understand the trials and tribulations of being in a band, whether or not you're a fan of the Go-Go's.A great documentary: all the important players are interviewed; there's plenty of interesting content and it all moves along at an appropriately fast pace.I do think we ask far too much of bands. We not only want them to write great songs and give great performances, but we also seem to want to have pretty much full access to their lives. I do wish we could be kinder to musicians, to the people whose music so enriches our lives.",False
17,7,Bravo,hammerhedd,n/a,15/08/2025,I recently discovered their first album in a thrift shop. Thought I would give the documentary a view. W0W what a great history lesson!! A must watch for any music buff.,False
18,7,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Go-Go's,burlesonjesse5,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""Oh my god. This is gonna be huge"". Yup, it's gonna be ""Double-Platinum"" huge. The Go-Go's (my latest review) is about a band that was the cat's pajamas, well at least during the early 80's. ""Go-Go's"" is a documentary with said band consisting of five no-BS women. They were the first all-female new wavers to play their own instruments, sing their own songs, write their own songs, and top the Billboard album charts. ""We Got the Beat"" indeed.So yeah, I've seen The Go-Go's on a docu before. It was an episode of VH1's Behind the Music circa the year 2000. 2020's The Go-Go's is a little longer in length, a little more subdued, and provides about thirty minutes more in terms of insight. ""Go-Go's"" even shows the girls jamming in present day while writing some new material.The Go-Go's while chronologically time-lined in its approach, effectively revels in zoomed-in archive footage, uninhibited interviews from the band members (along with managers and rock critics), and punk rock attributes that were their initial identity. The storytelling may be a little straightforward and clean but that doesn't mean your not drawn to Belinda Carlisle and her four other, tough love besties.Not a shameless ploy but fair, the question at the end of the film is this: Should The Go-Go's be included in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame? Sure, why not. Nirvana got in and like The Go-Go's, they only put out about three to four albums.Bottom line: The Go-Go's similar in journey and duration to The Mamas and the Papas, are relevant today despite not having a hit record since 1984. Otherwise there wouldn't be a ninety-minute flick green-lighted that talks about their tumultuous experiences. See The Go-Go's on Showtime with interviewee F-bombs attached. Go-Go's drummer Gina Schock waives any kind of ladylike filter. Rating: 3 stars.",True
19,5,Gives You An Idea of Pop We Probably Already Knew,lambiepie-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"What is so interesting about this documentary is that it isn't very interesting at all, and that is not a bad thing. It's a documentary about pop artists that ran their course, split up, got back together after time apart to give it one more shot into their old days for their fans.I guess the most interesting thing to pull one to this documentary is to bill the Go-Gos as ""the first female rock group"". I never thought that then, and don't think that now, however all the trappings of any pop group was bestowed upon these ladies, and what pulls one in is that they could keep up with the rest of them with the drugs and alcohol. Who didn't? But again, no new territory here. And members who didn't get along for the same old reasons that eventually they never get along once popularity hits from hits. And the solo career of their lead singer, no new territory there either.Again, a pop 80s documentary to add to the list of 80s pop documentaries out there with no new territory to cover, just a 'nice thing to know, if you care to know, if you already didn't know in the first place.",False
20,5,None of the Usual Rock-Doc Dummies,fredshuster,n/a,15/08/2025,"Terrific, consistently entertaining doc, especially good because -- for once -- these colorful media creations are seemingly telling the truth. Very welcome is the perspective of ex (and first) manager Ginger Canzoneri, booking agent Miles Copeland, and founding bassist Margot Olavarria, who was jettisoned early because she didn't want to follow the yellow brick road to pop success. Thankfully, ubiquitous rock doc dummies -- Grohl and Rollins -- are not included, although a Rolling Stone writer nobody has ever heard of is given screen time. The band is expected to launch its annual farewell tour next year.",False
21,4,From hits to hypocrites.,Ionian1973,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a tough documentary to get through only because the go-gos themselves come off so unlikable that it's hard to have any empathy for any of the hardships they talk about.They love pushing the feminism thing and girl power but then when they were told about the extra money they could make when other managers came sniffing around - male managers at that - they had zero issue tossing their longtime manager to the curb and eagerly doing what the so-called male managers told them to do. Not so much girl power and sisterhood there, eh? It just makes them look bad as they double down and say how they needed a more experienced manager. Hello? Your original manager knew enough to fight stiff records to keep your publishing when you knuckleheads would have given it away. She deserves some respect just for that alone.So when later on in the doc when they all start crying about how they felt betrayed about what happened in the band, it's hard to feel any empathy for them in any shape after seeing how they treated their manager.Then at the end of the doc they're trying to noodle through some badly written new song and they're still talking about wondering about ""woman's place in the future"". Ok, can the feminist crap. You showed who you really were when you canned your manager and ran eagerly to a male one when a few dollars were dangled in front of your coke-covered noses.Overall I walked away just disliking the go-gos, especially as people. I guess that's how it goes. Worth a watch just for being able to see all that glitters is not gold and watching first hand how a huge band can just implode and fall apart.",False
22,1,"Not a fan, and wasn't swayed after watching",tiffanie_says_stay_in_your_lane,n/a,15/08/2025,"I happened to catch this on the CW channel. I saw a bunch of girls with hair dyed all sorts of colors and wearing zany outfits, so I became fascinated. I had no idea who they were, and then I recognized them once I heard the name. I'm a self-professed music junkie. I'll listen to pretty much anything, excluding classical and country. I'm actually not a fan of the Go-Go's. I only knew about them because I get Music Choice on my TV. I had heard a couple of their songs - ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" and ""Vacation"" - when I happened to stop on the 80s channel as I was flipping through. I love to see all-female groups. Like a lot of other industries, the music business is male-dominated, so they don't receive much attention. For that reason, I was open to learning about them. Unfortunately though, as hard as I tried, I just couldn't make it through the whole thing. I watched it for about 45 minutes or so before I lost interest. I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that I don't care for punk rock. I'm a fan of rock music from the counterculture movement of the 1960s. I love The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, Fleetwood Mac, The Eagles, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, as well as British groups, particularly Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, and The Who. I've also been listening to some grunge lately. I can't identify with the whole anger and poed attitude that defines punk rock. I also found the documentary itself to be pretentious. I'm sure the group had challenges, but it just seemed over-dramatized. I echo the sentiments of another reviewer - the whole girl power thing did seem fake. They ultimately broke up due to issues with collaboration, and poor social cohesion. Not saying those aren't legitimate reasons, but most other bands break up over some heavy stuff (death of members, substance abuse, etc.). While drug addiction did play a role in their breakup, a lot of it sounded like typical relational drama that's characteristic of women. Kathy Valentine said it hurt the most because of the way it was announced, and Gina Schock felt like it wasn't done in such a manner that would be expected after working with someone for so many years. Makes you wonder if they got along behind the scenes. I didn't even know they were supposed to be a punk band, to tell the truth. Their songs have a pop sound to them. People have just gotten brainwashed into thinking they're a punk rock band. The only aspect of punk they embodied was the lifestyle. Their environment and experiences were huge factors that caused them to gravitate towards hanging out with a punk crowd. They had a crappy childhood, which led to mental health problems, like suicidal ideation. Their middle and high school years were filled with loneliness and confusion. Going to punk rock clubs was like an outlet for their pent up rage, and gave them a sense of belonging, leading them to form their own band. How they lived is what made them punk, but their music didn't match their lifestyle. Not only do their songs sound nothing like punk (besides pop, they have a surf/beachy vibe going on too, if you listen closely), but the subjects and themes aren't related to the genre either. Punk lyrics communicate frustration with society. ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" is about people who gossip, and ""Vacation"" is about a girl who's in a relationship, willingly takes a trip by herself, but then starts missing her boyfriend. What does that have to do with punk? I guess I would recommend this to fans only. Just as a warning though, if you're not a fan, but you're interested to learn about them, it's quite tedious to get through. Similar to The Beatles, I feel like The Go-Go's are overrated. There's a ton of other bands to explore, so you're really missing out if you're only listening to what's promoted by the media. I honestly think this will speak to people who are fans, and/or like punk rock in general, but it won't influence people who have never heard of them to become fans.",False

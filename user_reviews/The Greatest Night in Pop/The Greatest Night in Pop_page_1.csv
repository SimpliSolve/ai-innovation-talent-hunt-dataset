1,8,A fly in the wall,raf_dcs,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started watching knowing nothing about the behind the scenes. I knew there was a bunch of famous artists, I knew about the french parody and I definitely remembered Bruce Springsteen's weird face while singing.I was instantly fascinated by the whole thing, it's a great watch, a lot of fun facts I loved to hear about. It's the kind of story that's so absurd it shouldn't have worked out but in the end it did.There are some heartwarming moments, the Belafonte bit was beautiful or whenever they would cheer after someone sang. Most of them seemed genuinely excited to be there and the doc makes you feel like a witness to it all.However I do wish there were more speakers, they should have reached out to more singers, I would have loved to see footage of the singers talking about the project afterwards.It also makes you question why those songs don't happen anymore, can you imagine Beyonce and Taylor Swift coming together to raise money to a cause?And then I remembered that most artists nowadays won't set foot outside North America and Europe when they go on their ""world tours"" so I'm feeling bittersweet about it all but it's still a great watch.",False
2,9,Couldn't Stop Watching,sectionmaven-08824,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't recall the last time I watched a film from beginning to end without taking a break or even thinking of taking a break. And this has nothing to do with the quality of the ultimate product, although the film made me appreciate ""We Are the World"" far more than I did at the time of its creation. The experience of seeing how this event was created, assembled and carried out was mesmerizing, engrossing and tremendously moving.The film enlarged, exponentially, my knowledge and understanding of the individuals who participated in creating the song and video. For example, I appreciate, for the first time, the scope of Lionel Ritchie's talent, which extends far beyond singing. Wrangling pop stars is more difficult than herding house cats, but Ritchie proved to be a master of the art. He was the film's star, with Stevie Wonder and Quincy Jones close behind. The scenes showing Stevie's interactions with Ray Charles and Bob Dylan were, at the same time, hilarious and moving.The film also enhanced my appreciation of the level of talent that participated in the project. As a contemporary of most of the participants, I realize now that they were a lot more talented than I might have thought back in the 1980s.From a technical standpoint, condensing a ten-hour all night recording session into the last hour of a ninety minute film was no mean feat. The editing of tons of archival material into a coherent narrative was masterful. If Netflix can mount more retrospective documentaries of similar events from the late twentieth century, I would welcome the endeavor.If I have one criticism, it is that I wanted to know more about the selection process, about the artists who elected not to participate, and about the one, Waylon Jennings, who walked out. Madonna was mentioned once. And maybe Waylon was there because he lost a bet to his pal Willie, and of course Prince was Prince. But Waylon and Willie were the only representatives of a genre that IS music to millions of Americans. Were any others asked?But on the whole, the film was an Oscar level documentary and should be recognized as such.",False
3,9,Watching Music History,DrRumack,n/a,16/08/2025,"In 1985, We Are The World was huge. We saw the video over and over and over again.We all had the album and listened to it countless times. It was on the radio non-stop. It was an immensely powerful song.Watching this documentary and learning how the song came about and how they managed to get all the biggest names in Music together, it let me re-experience it all. Watching it was both nostalgic and entertaining. But also sad watching the great artists who aren't around anymore.It's a Must See for anyone who was around back in '85.And, after nearly 40 years, I finally learned why Prince wasn't there.",False
4,10,A Glimpse Into Something Real,malachiweaver,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is everything I want from a documentary. It was both informative and entertaining, and it gave me a brief glimpse into something raw and real. It effectively captures the feeling of being in that recording studio on that specific night in the company of the biggest names in music at the time - the exhilaration but also the pressure and tension felt by everyone in the room (Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Quincy Jones, Bruce Springsteen, Cyndi Lauper, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Diana Ross, the list goes on and on). I felt like I got to know each of these artists a little bit better because of their raw emotions and vulnerability that were on display in the footage.I wasn't alive when ""We are the World"" was released in 1985. However, I distinctly remember when the 25th anniversary rendition was released in 2010 and being instantly enthralled by the sheer power of so many iconic voices united for one important cause. I've watched that video over and over, and I get the same visceral feeling every time. This documentary adds depth and context to that feeling, and I now have even more appreciation for the original song.",False
5,10,Magnificent! Wish I'd Been There!,beckschemu,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is Chefs kiss. I love Michael Jackson's songs and We Are The World is no exception. It's so catchy and I love harmonizing along with the artists. I enjoyed this documentary. I had always wanted to see something like it. To go behind the scenes, and it did not disappoint. From the song creation process - which is something I always wonder about as a music listener, to the retakes to the teamwork to the balancing of egos. I appreciated the no-holds-barred , honest interviews and I'm so grateful they took videos that night. I resonated with what Diana Ross voiced ie she didn't want that night to be over. I didnt want the Docu to be over either. When it began, you could tell they were all nervous, but as it went on, it became everybody's favorite project and everybody brought their A game. Lionel Richie as a narrator is so good. Great sense of humour and sharp memory. You could see from the documentary that the artists cared for the cause and cared even more for the craft and had an admiration and respect for each other, despite their differences in ages , skin color or accolades. Loved the autograph scene. I loved that all the artists were trying on such short notice, and adapting their vocal ranges as they went along. Hueys narrations were vivid and beautiful. He is a captivating storyteller. MJ came across as so humble and a perfectionist, Quincy Jones = a genius, Al was hilarious, and I loved that he and Stevie are multilingual. Bruce Springsteen got the Midas touch and aging like fine wine. Stevie Wonder - how does he make playing the piano and singing look so effortless? It truly was a highlight for me, seeing him work his magic. Harry Belafonte, God bless you for thinking of this concept. Ray Charles, iconic. Lionel's voice as the song starts, is absolutely pristine. MJs voice is angelic. Cyndi Lauper coming through with the harmonization has always been one of my fave bits of the song. It's interesting to see that part play out in the Docu. Tina Turner - goodness, what a goddess. I love Prince but I know most artists are like Bob (Dylan) and Prince, introverts who'd rather work alone so I understand. I'm grateful Bob Dylan showed up. It was for a good cause. A great cause. It was great to see how demanding artists are of themselves even when they are top of their game. They are still perfectionists. I learnt something there. Loved MJs outfit and as a dear fan, I really appreciated insights into his songwriting process. Seeing him collaborate with Richie to come up with the melody was awesome. So casually too. Geniuses make it look easy. It's nice to see his siblings there to support him. Steve Perry's vocals - wow. James Ingram. I could go on and on. This docu had everything: the tea, the laughs, the love, the tears, the emotions, the high notes, just...a delectable mix. I enjoyed it and it makes me sad that we are at an age where the icons have left or are leaving us. Nothing lasts forever but it was good while it lasted. I'm glad this song is here with us. Two quotes I loved from the show, to paraphrase: 1) How music is something spiritual that traverses space and time to come touch your soul 2) Be happy when you comeback home because one day there'll be no home to come back to. Whew! That last one was emotional. I LOVED the Docu and I LOVE the song. Shout out to Bob Geldof for the inspiration. #TheGreatestNightInPop #Netflix.",False
6,10,Informative and emotional,camimr-55885,n/a,16/08/2025,"Simply and shortly put, this was incredible.We are being introduced anew to this important piece of history.Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie was a power duo in making this happen, for such an important cause.Enjoy learning from A to Z just how impactful this really was, and still is.Netflix needs to release more of these, so that the younger generations truly understand the value of music history, as it was. I wish music could still be like this, about something greater than yourself. The act of giving, caring and unity. Todays artist have a lot to learn from this.Thank you... ""We Are The World""",False
7,10,A Captivating Journey Through Musical History,aa_agreene,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix's 'The Greatest Night in Pop' delivers a mesmerizing journey through one of the most iconic moments in music history. This captivating documentary offers an intimate look into the making of 'We Are the World,' showcasing the brilliance of the artists who came together for a cause greater than themselves and the sacrifices made by all involved. With exclusive interviews, archival footage, and behind-the-scenes insights, the film transports viewers back to that historic night, highlighting the passion, camaraderie, and sheer talent that defined the recording session. From Michael Jackson's visionary leadership to Quincy Jones' masterful production, every aspect of this monumental event is explored with depth and reverence. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the artists involved or simply appreciate the power of music to inspire change, 'The Greatest Night in Pop' is a must-watch. It not only celebrates the magic of that unforgettable night but also reminds us of the enduring impact music can have on the world.",False
8,n/a,The Big Unanswered Question,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I waited 97 minutes to find out why Dan Akroyd was in that recording studio. I still don't know. As much as I loved the Blues Brothers, that doesn't make him a singer.The only two huge stars of the time missing were Prince and Madonna. We learned about Prince in all his solitary weirdness but Madonna was mentioned only for a split second.For anyone who's been in a professional recording studio, Cyndi Lauper having to remove her jewelry was hilarious. The microphones pick up everything, even the proverbial dropped pin. To anyone questioning why she was there, take a quick look at the pop charts from say 1983 to 1986 - there's your answer.",False
9,7,Lovely throwback piece that makes you want to know more! [+72%],arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Netflix documentary takes you back to a certain night - January 28, 1985, to be particular - when legendary musicians of the time came together to create a (now iconic) song that'd contribute to a charitable cause. The story behind the conception and production of the song, narrated with buzzing energy by Lionel Richie, is one where you wouldn't anticipate multiple layers. For starters, to bring all of these musical geniuses (..and I'm talking the likes of Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Diana Ross, Cyndi Lauper, Ray Charles, Huey Lewis, Kenny Rogers, and many more) under the same roof to record the track over the course of a single night - that sounds as fascinating as it is stressful. You gotta give plaudits to producer Quincy Jones for keeping them in unison all through the night, even when there were hints of things going awry.I can't envision something of this kind happening in today's music scene. Even if a producer wanted to compose a universally resonating track featuring a hundred artists of this generation, it would all be made with modern software technology that'd make it easier to dissociate from, as a music lover. The sheer energy that we can see leaking in the archival footage is something that's hard to replicate. There's even a moment where blind musicians Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles accompany each other to the restroom - like, where else would you hear that kind of a story? I also like how Richie confidently plays the role of a pacifier within this large group; that too on the same night he hosted the AMAs and won half a dozen awards.Admittedly, the piece does show signs of indulgence towards the end, but it's clever on the makers' part not to keep it too lengthy and unfocused. In its current form, it's a delectable throwback piece that'd simply wow you with all the wonderful footage, the unquestionable charisma of these incredible artists, and the production crew that managed to keep the tightrope steady for some of our favourite musical legends to seamlessly walk on. They created art that night, and we still appreciate it almost four decades later!",False
10,10,"The Greatest ""Dream Team"" Of All Time!",spasek,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe greatest collection of musical artists of all-time is still something that is talked about 40 years later, and it will continue to be talked about for another 40.We have seen many duplications but none have reached quite the same level as this group that volunteered and came together to do something for the good of others. It was a selfless act that would end up becoming one of the best-selling singles ever recorded.""Check Your Egos"" at the door was the sign that Quincy Jones put above the door. While this was a challenging night for the artists, the producers and crew were under even more pressure, knowing that they had only one night (a few hours, actually) to get this done.The behind-the-scenes footage along with many stars talking about their experiences, is mesmerizing as well as chaotic, which only causes the viewer to have an even greater appreciation for how it all came together within just a few hours.I was amazed at how Quincy Jones and the crew were able to find the unique combinations of singers to put together for the verses (well, half a verse!). We look at the finished product and just go, ""Wow!"" But to see how it all came together is an even bigger, ""Wow!""I've listened to this song hundreds of times, and it still makes me emotional to hear it. Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson did such an amazing job with the music and lyrics. I also loved seeing how much profound admiration and respect the artists had for each other.However it was Bob Geldof who set the tone by explaining to the artists why they were there and why the song was so important. Almost immediately you could see the look in each artist's eyes as the realization sank in. This would be one of the most important things they would ever do, and easily end up being, perhaps, the most amazing collaboration of all-time. It's hard for me to think of anything that surpasses it.With one night, this song united the world, even if for a very brief time. People don't realize what an incredibly powerful thing that is, and how it can, indeed, change the world and change lives. What can be a more nobler purpose than that?",True
11,7,Interesting Documentary,mchl88,n/a,16/08/2025,"Solid documentary with some funny asides and interesting insights. I knew a lot about this night from my research for my book On This Date in Music, but there were still a few surprises (like the impromptu ""Day-O"" song and Huey Lewis singing Prince's line).The best part of this was seeing how awkward Bob Dylan was in a room full of celebrities. He was, at the time, the royalty of American pop music and yet he seemed so out of place and nervous every time the camera found him. Guess that's the difference between an artist and a performer.If you have Netflix and are old enough to remember this era in pop music when artists thought they could save the world, I'd recommend this documentary.",False

13,7,"Surprisingly entertaining .. ""Check your ego at the door""",paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""The Greatest Night In Pop"" (2024 release; 97 min) opens, we see a bunch of pop and rock superstars getting together to record a benefit single. We then go back to ""December 23, 1984"", and Lionel Richie gets together with Harry Bellafonte and producer Quincy Jones, to prepare for an all-star charity recording (to combat starvation in Ethiopia) barely a month later, the same night that the American Music Awards are held in LA. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the documentary...Couple of comments: if you are a certain ago, you will vividly remember the era, as the British and US single releases of ""Do They Know It's Christmas Time"" and ""We Are the World"" aimed to raise millions for the starving population in Ethiopia. This documentary captures how ""We Are the World"" came together, with a particular focus on the night of the recording itself, when 47 of the biggest names in the music business gathered. As I was watching this, this reminds us how pivotal Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson (who co-wrote the song) were. Also how petty Prince was (he declined to participate for no good reason, frankly for no reason at all). Also how extremely uncomfortable Bob Dylan looks the entire night. Also the immense pressure on getting it done in a single evening, as there was only one night to get it done, period. And last but certainly not least: how insanely young everyone looks (Springsteen, Billy Joel, etc.). It is frankly hard to imagine how this could ever happen again, at least on this level of magnitude. And whoever put up that sign above the entrance door to the studio ""Check your ego at the door"", kudos to you! All that aside, I must say that I was surprised how surprisingly entertaining this documentary turned out to be.""The Greatest Night In Pop"" premiered just a few weeks ago and the Sundance film festival. It started streaming on Netflix earlier this week, and I just caught up with it last night. If you are a music fan, I'd readily suggest this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
14,4,"Unfortunately, this biopic was boring and added nothing to the conversation.",WordUnheard,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love the fact that everyone came together in 1985 and made a song that benefited so many in Africa. It was an amazing event to live through and witness as it was happening. The same with Live Aid. So I was hoping that this documentary would reveal a lot of little-known facts and behind-the-scenes footage.I didn't get that. There were some behind-the-scenes footage, but I'd already seen it. It only highlighted how lacking this song really was. Without the names, this song would have never been successful. I hate to say that about a song that has contributed so much, but that's just my opinion.I love the event and I love what it contributed to Africa and the R&B, pop, and country music culture. It deserves a lot better than what this has to offer.",False
15,9,I Was Surprised,Hitchcoc,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have no qualms about praising this piece. It is great that after over thirty some years, we get to see the effort that went into producing this record. Of course, there are critical comments about how these big ticket stars could have opened their pocketbooks and sent a bunch of money to Africa. It's interesting how the first thing out of some people's mouth is to put down the effort that was made. The moneys that came from this far exceeded anything these people could have contributed. The beauty was the herding of cats in a venue that was being constructed on the fly. Lionel Richie had to be in way over his head at times. It was also interesting to see that some of the performers, famous as they were, became frightened that they couldn't deliver a one or two sentence solo. Of course, others didn't like the people that were there. Bob Dylan is frequently criticized. But we all know how he sounds and he was contributing for the overall impact of the production. I have to say that when I watched this, I didn't think all that much about Huey Lewis. He becomes a major contributor to the documentary. Anyway, what an effort to draw these people together. Leaving a major awards show and heading off to do this. It will never happen again.",False
16,9,Wow! It gave me goosebumps.,wjcvdb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seeing all this talent come together for a great cause is truly heartwarming. Lionel Richie, a fantastic storyteller and host, alongside Quincy Jones, skillfully managed this remarkable group of artists, ensuring a seamless flow. The homage paid to Harry Belafonte as the initiator was particularly touching. Watching the writing and recording process with Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie is great fun. MJ's voice is incredibly pristine. I'm grateful that this has heightened awareness about issues beyond our safe environments, specifically combatting famine in Ethiopia, and has raised a substantial amount of money. Thanks to Netflix for creating this wonderful documentary. It really gave me goosebumps.",False
17,8,They left their egos at the door,Judy-B31085,n/a,16/08/2025,"My kids were 5 and 10 when We Are the World was released. They couldn't get enough of it probably because Michael Jackson was a big part of it and they knew the money was going to feed kids in Africa. This behind the scenes account of how Harry Belafonte inspired Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson, and Quincy Jones to make it happen is beautiful and funny with some very personal commentary by many of the dozens of artists who did the marathon recording. Their effort seems like something that would never happen today even though we surely could use the love and selflessness they embodied the night they gathered in one studio to record the song. The reflections by Richie, Bruce Springsteen, Smokey Robinson , Cindy Lauper and others make this a special film. It's a little long but worth sticking with it.",False
18,10,Amazing behind the scenes view!,conceptscreator,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere is so much to go through for this docu!But one thing it really showed well is the process of how that song was made, what it was made for, how they managed to get those people in a time where it was far harder to do so!And then to write the song in such a short time and then even in a shorter amount of time to record it all, with so many different people and ego's that had to stay outside!I think this shows how Talented Michael Jackson was as songwrite as well as Lionel Richie!Yes Quincy is a big part of it, but without a doubt those 2 made that very important groud layer for the song, and of course then the whole idea of doing it so many artists was an amazing idea as well from the team!It was an amazing peace to watch, and of course unique views we haven't even seen before, including of course from Michael Jackson!I would easily recommend this to anyone!",True
19,n/a,precious gift,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw it with the desire of resurrection of beautiful memories about one of precious gifts from my childhood under Ceausescu regime.And , indeed, it is a precious gift for people attached by 80 decade because it offers more than behind scene details but precise portraits, attitudes and the roots of impressive work, an idea inspired by Harry Belafonte, sustained by Lionel Ritchie and Michael Jackson, personalities and answers to a great challenge, a night modelling world and a powerful message. Something very near miracle. And the precise traits of a period, with all its aspects.Difficult to define it.Only the joy, details and the steps to the final show are real significant.So, a precious gift for the inner child living in me.

20,7,Wonderful Documentary for People with No Real Knowledge of the Event,dbrown-74934,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved ""We Are the World"" when the song came out in 1985, and while I enjoyed the documentary, I was a bit disappointed because there was hardly any new ground plowed, but rather a rehash of what is already in the public domain about the song and its genesis. The filmmaker used a lot of footage from ""We Are The World: The Story Behind The Song,"" the documentary that came out in 1985.There were a few little tidbits of new information, e.g., what Kenny Loggins said Paul Simon said about John Denver, mention of some musicians that weren't able to participate, and the reasoning behind how the musicians were chosen for various singing parts. With that said, it is amazing that the musicians interviewed still seemed to relish their participation in such a monumental event almost 40 years later. Huey Lewis, especially, seemed to still be awed by his involvement. Both he and Lionel Richie also seemed to remember the events like they just occurred yesterday. Overall, it is a wonderful documentary for someone who has no real knowledge of the event and loves the song.",False
21,10,My Personal Humble Opinion,g_lisbeth,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mr Dylan was so lost, it seems to me he was stoned 🤣
Very nice work with legends. A classic !!I grew up listening to this song and I always wanted to know more about the production of the video with the legendary singers. In this documentary you can find nostalgic, pure talent, and the best: the reunion and meeting of the most popular and historic singers in world music !!! I almost cried when I saw the video, it brought me memories when I was 6 years old. I was born in 1978 so 80s was my thing. The documentary is essential in everyone's 80s people soul. You must watch it! You will not regret and you will feel it in your blood...",False
22,6,Bit Hyperbolic But Not Bad,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not horrible but listening to these people talk you'd think they saved the world-the song was average, I think it was more that all these 'shiny people' were all together at the same time. So many iconic artists that have withstood time but some of the people included had no business being included (Cyndi Lauper, Dan Akyroyd, to name a few) and the song was more a giant promo for Pepsi than it was anything remotely associated with Ethiopia. All these people could have kicked in enough money to really make a difference but they're asking people living paycheck to paycheck to throw money at them so they could take credit for the donation. 'We're saving our own lives'? Seriously? There's so many wonderful artists who weren't even considered for this (John Denver or Dolly Parton anyone?) but people like Dylan who absolutely talk-sings, and DOES NOT sing with a choir, they lost Waylon who was an actual legend, over being completely unorganized, but somehow they were able to pull it all together and make a song. They did raise incredible amounts of money and did so in a way that dispersed it in very intelligent and creative ways that utilized the funds in a wonderful way, all because Harry Belafonte had a vision and wanted to make a difference. And for that, it's pretty cool and I'll give it 6 of 10.",False
23,8,"Exemplary documentary making, a must watch!",MarkLotinga-1064,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not going to lie, I always regarded We are the World by USA for Africa as very much the poor relation to Band Aid's Do they know it's Christmas?And although they are vastly different types of song in the main I still hold that view.Having now watched this documentary I can at least hold this effort in higher regard.This is not quite riveting stuff but close to it, I was a bit 50/50 on adding it to my list, could something really be referred to as The Greatest Night in Pop?My answer is, quite possibly, yes.Over just shy of 100 minutes we are taken across the journey of this song from Harry Belafonte's first ""idea"", through the pivotal roles that Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones and Stevie wonder played.Through to the tortuous execution in that room at A&M studious that went on ""all night long"".Excellent contributions from Lionel in the main, Bruce Spingsteen, Huey Lewis and Cyndi Lauper, it always helps to hear from the people that were actually there at the time.The extensive archive footage was invaluable too!Of special note and I am far from Bob's biggest fan, the seemingly impromptu speech that Bob Geldof gave before recording started was about as spot on as one could imagine or hope for.The talent on display here dwarfs that on hand for Band Aid by some margin, so many genuine icons and legends.Last but not least, facts are facts, Bob Dylan cannot sing and I still do not know why Dan Aykroyd was involved.All in all, this is exemplary documentary making, a must watch!#TheGreatestNightInPop.",False
24,6,Just Okay,DVK1234,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember the global pop artist movement for Ethiopia back in 1984-85, beginning with Bob Geldof and BandAid and ""Feed the World"", to USA response, ""We Are the World"", to Canada's ""Tears Are Not Enough"". As an unenlightened teenager, I was struck by the title of the US song: ""We Are the World"". It triggered me: is USA intimating that ""they"" are the world? Now, many years later, I realize that the theme of the song is that when part of humanity suffers, we all suffer. I think that my original perception about the US effort being self-serving and indulgent was somewhat accurate; given the idolatry bestowed to the American pop star, it could not help but be so.For the most part, the documentary doesn't paint the participants in the most positive, altruistic light. ""Check your ego at the door"" needs to be written as a reminder to them...I would submit that no such sign was displayed in Britain or in Canada. ""Is Prince coming?"", ""There is a rivalry between he and Michael"". An upset Sheila E. Tells viewers she was ""used"" to get Prince to participate. She's not getting a coveted solo, and she leaves.Stevie Wonder asks that Swahili be inserted in the song, only for the group to have a revelation that Swahili is not spoken in Ethiopia? Oh dear, perhaps learn a little something beyond your front yard.I watched the whole thing. The artists are truly talented, and the song was very good. I always preferred the UK and Canadian songs, but that's just me. I found it interesting that they didn't show us the finished music video. I had to go to YouTube to find that. Actually this doc was very boring, and I'm not sure what the hype is about it.I don't recommend.",False
25,3,We are the Weird,Lejink,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just a wee bit of exaggeration in the title to this documentary, methinks. The night in question related to the date in early 1985 when effectively the American version of ""Live Aid"" was recorded, at a studio in L. A. featuring some of the best known popular music acts past and present Stateside.Presented by the main driving source behind the enterprise, Lionel Richie, this was a sometimes sentimental, sometimes hyperbolic and if I'm being honest, often quite boring reminiscence of how the hit song ""We are the World"" came to be recorded. Bruce Springsteen, one of the major participants, makes the retrospective point, diplomatically you feel, that while the song itself might not be to everyone's taste, including his own you suspect, at least it did a lot of good with the substantial funds it raised to help feed the hungry in Africa.As documentaries go, there's really not much to see here. Richie talks about writing the song with Michael Jackson, interestingly after Stevie Wonder was given first refusal and then corralling one of the top musical agents of the day, a guy called Ken Kragen to bring on board other big-name acts, including Quincy Jones as producer, to make it effectively an all-star affair.Only of course it wasn't quite an all-star affair with no Madonna or Prince, two of the biggest stars of the day, despite the latter being invited. Still, they managed to enlist some genuine legends like Harry Belafonte, Ray Charles and Smokey Robinson who are put together alongside the young Turks of the day like Cyndi Lauper, Kenny Loggins and Huey Lewis, none of whom, I think it's fair to say, will ever be called legends.Amongst those lined up to look back today were Richie, Springsteen, who must be catching up with Rick Wakeman in the number of rockumentaries in which he's appeared, plus the afore-mentioned Lauper, Loggins and Lewis, as well as a bunch of technical guys who helped out on the session itself.I'm not struck on the song personally although I likewise didn't care for ""Do They Know It's Christmas"" either, which reminds me that Bob Geldof makes a ""no show without Punch"" appearance very much as you would expect. Other moments of minor amusement occurred when Stevie Wonder tried to insert a line in Swahili, causing an obviously befuddled Waylon Jennings to promptly walk out - you just see his stetson disappearing into the foreground - Cyndi Lauper wearing about a million necklaces around her neck unaware they're causing sound interference every time she moves her head and best of all a completely out of place Bob Dylan who after Quincy tells them all not to sing if the key is too high, keeps his mouth firmly shut while all around him are emoting for Africa.Like I said it was all for a good cause and maybe I'm being too critical but watching this bloated music video certainly wasn't the greatest night of my life.",False

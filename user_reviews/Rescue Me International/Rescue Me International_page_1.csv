1,8,RSPCA Title?,rcshaw-79646,n/a,17/08/2025,"The documentary itself highlights the work of dedicated individuals and organizations caring for abandoned felines in the UK; however, one thing seems to have slipped by the writers and/or editors. Is RSPCA really the Royal Society for the Protection and Cruelty to Animals or is it the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals? The presenter calls it the former at least twice, but the RSPCA website is different. This may appear to be a pedantic criticism; however, given the work that the RSPCA does, especially in regulation and prosecution, it may be worthwhile to make an edit. Having said that, the documentary is helpful to those who should be informed about the legal aspects of cat breeding and care.",False
2,10,Feline rescue,jmorrey-1,n/a,17/08/2025,Watching this made my heart melt! How can some people mistreat or abandon animals! Its interesting that there are so many local cat rescue centers out there that do just as good a job as RSPCA and Battersea but never get the credit. These rescue organisations are run by volunteers relying on charitable donations,False

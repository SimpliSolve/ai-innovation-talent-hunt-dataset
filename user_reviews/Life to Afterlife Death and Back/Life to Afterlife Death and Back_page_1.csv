1,10,MUST WATCH,vserrano,n/a,16/08/2025,"OMG I don't know where to even start. My wife and I watched this film and we ended up balling our eyes out. We are a Christian family and were raised believing jesus's Lord and savior. But there's always this worry that you may not be living up to his standard, and the grace versus works. Battle continues day by day, but these testimonies have opened our eyes to the goodness of the Lord. I truly am a changed man now and I praise God for the people that testified in this documentary, and had the courage to come forward to explain that God is good. Even to the atheist he gave grace and a lot of second chance. And now we see there is a second and third film to watch which we are eager to start right away. Thank you so much!",False
2,6,Solid,qballsmith,n/a,16/08/2025,A decent dive into the subject yet the format makes the same mistake other shows on NDE's make like I survived beyond and back. I've never understood why they feel the need to jump from story to story in sections so just as your following along and getting into one of the stories they stop and go to another person's experience. It makes it feel a little disjointed and disrupts the flow of the story telling and doesn't let you settle in and absorb the stories. Would prefer to just follow one experience at a time personally. Other than that it's pretty good. All the experiences seem very heartfelt and told with great detail.,False
3,n/a,Bull,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Religious propaganda. Designed to frighten you into submission. All the same stereotypes, threats, fears. If God is all loving and nonjudgmental why does hell exist? If you don't believe in God you will be punished for eternity. I am wondering what religious sect the producer is connected to. And who paid to have this documentary"" made. My first clue was when the woman said ""she almost was in hell"". Then the nurse said "" the Doctor was an atheist. The next clue was when the old man said "" I was a selfish atheist"" What is it that makes an atheist selfish? Come n people this movie was advertising to believe or else!",False

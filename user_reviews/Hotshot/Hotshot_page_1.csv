1,10,Profound on a Variety of Levels,baumannjeremiah,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the definitive film on wildland fire.If you're a wildland firefighter you will find yourself emotional at experiencing your work and culture finally shown with fidelity and affection.If you're not a firefighter, you will see:
1) Incredible cinematography of the remarkable natural phenomenon of extreme fire behavior.2) A heartfelt personal story of a filmmaker's relationship with an extraordinary firefighter and his improbable subsequent journey into filming the elusive and misunderstood world of wildfire and hotshot culture.3) Important and moving elements of documentary filmmaking that properly situates the subject matter (Interagency Hotshot Crews) in time and history and sociopolitical context, and profound wisdom applicable to wildfire and far beyond.What a tremendous undertaking: to film what was filmed, over 6 years; then to carefully and truthfully build context around that footage.I believe this will be an important film right now, as numerous issues are addressed, and for generations to come, as fire itself and firefighting itself both contain timeless elements inexorably tied to physics, nature, and human nature...and as a timepiece marking this era of fire as the other constantly-evolving elements of wildfire develop and change.This is *the* definitive wildland fire film.",False
2,10,Nothing else like it,JayMoore1171,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not a traditional documentary. It flows like a movie, LOOKS like a big tentpole narrative feature. The cinematography is spectacular, and the obvious theme here is ""show, don't tell"", as there's no time spent on talking heads, no interviews, nobody tells you what a fire tornado looks like, they go in and show you.The pacing is very unique, and there is a lot of contrast to what can sometimes be truly horrifying and devastating imagery. But it's all presented in a very poetic, sometimes hilarious way. A genuine tribute to the roughnecks who do the insane work of putting out wildfires by hand.Absolutely worth your time. A haunting, thought-provoking picture that you have to see several times to unpack fully.",False
3,10,Brilliant Work!,billharsey,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a 4th generation logger from Oregon, our whole family has been around wildfires for a long time. Many of us have worked on them.When loggers are asked to work on fires it's usually bad.. It's also a part of life out here in the big timber.Yes i call some Hotshot firefighters good friends and have profound respect for what they do at work. You will see why.I never expected a movie to be as good as this one. Hotshot is hard hitting and shows some uncomfortable things but is worth every second.I can only compare the quality of this project to that of the late Japanese filmaker Akira Kurosawa in that it takes the viewer on an epic journey in a brilliantly filmed but dangerous landscape that these men and women work in.The brief news stories of wildland fire are never even close showing what is really happening out there..
It's hard work that can get one injured or killed fast.Hotshot (2023) illustrates the part the news media can't.Buckle up, drink some water and keep your eyes open.It's one hell of a ride.",False
4,10,Exquisitely captured real lives of Hotshots,frangiepod,n/a,16/08/2025,"Told with a thoughtful but honest narrative. You just get the sense this was a labor of love in more ways than one. It draws you in and makes you feel the dedication and sacrifice of these ""forest technicians"". They are truly our superheroes of the forests who deserve our deepest gratitude.This is some of the best cinematography I've ever seen of a world I knew very little about. The footage was stunning. Artfully captured the filmmaker made fire look like a dance that captivated your attention at every moment. I remember the movie Backdraft by Ron Howard and how he captured the fire and made it seem alive. It was the first time any film had done that. This is Backdraft 2.0, but real life. Bravo!",False
5,2,Filled with inaccuracies,lchotshotter,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an ex Asst. Supt. This video over exaggerates being a hotshot. The director fails to adequately portray what occurs during the initial 2 week training and the comradery that's build among the crew members. His understanding of fire, the issues in forest management, politics, and urban sprawl is pronounced throughout. While he has done a better job than most documentaries, he fails to really describe a hotshot, and the basics of fire behavior. He portrays fire suppression as happening because everyone wants their part of the pie and completely misses the fact of urban sprawl, of which California is the worst culprit.",False
6,10,Unbelievable.,toepherchris,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a avid documentary watcher and love the art of filmmaking. I have no training or excellence in the field other than my own thoughts and novice reads. This doc is one of the best that I have ever seen! As a former wartime Marine, I love to see docs in the realm of events that I have participated in and been through and this is right up there with WAR. I gripped a towel the entire time I watched because I am so high strung and was loving every minute of what I was watching. The educational value and what could be learned by watching this film is worthy of a rent/buy. I'm not sure what the correct words are for it, but the 'scenery' and 'fill' scenes are unbelievable to see and make you appreciate this world we live in. I think this doc is right up there with the likes of 'Free Solo' and other Academy award winners...it definitely has my vote. ***I purchased this doc strictly off the trailer and my love for Hotshots, Firefighters, etc.",False
7,10,"Exceptional, beautiful, cinemtatic immersive documentary of the world of wildland firefighting.",GnarlesC,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stunning cinematography, heartfelt personal storytelling, and profound contextual understanding to create a film that resonates deeply with both seasoned firefighters and the general audience.It shows more than tells.The film provides a rare and authentic portrayal of their work and culture, offering the recognition they rightfully deserve. It captures the raw emotions and unwavering commitment of these heroes as they face the challenges of the front lines.Even for those unfamiliar with firefighting, the film offers a breathtaking visual experience. The cinematography showcases the remarkable natural phenomena of extreme fire behavior, immersing the audience in the heart of a wildfire's raw power and beauty.The documentary also follows the personal journey of filmmaker Gabriel Kirkpatrick Mann, whose touching and improbable relationship with an extraordinary firefighter adds a compelling human element to the narrative. This personal touch humanizes the larger-than-life world of hotshot firefighting.It provides a comprehensive exploration, offering insights into the history, sociopolitical dynamics, and universal wisdom related to firefighting and wildfire management. It goes beyond mere documentation, offering profound insights that extend far beyond the realm of firefighting.The dedication of the filmmakers is evident in the meticulous six-year filming process and the careful construction of the narrative. Hotshot is not just a documentary; it's a timeless piece of cinematic art that captures an era in firefighting history and the unending battle against nature's fury.Hotshot stands as the definitive portrayal of wildland firefighting. It addresses critical issues of our time while capturing a timeless essence tied to physics, nature, and human nature. It's a mesmerizing, emotionally charged film that explores the relentless battle against fire and the indomitable spirit of those who brave the flames. A must-see for its captivating storytelling, emotional depth, and profound impact.",False
8,10,There will never be another film like this one.,bestplacego,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Behind the scenes"" is an understatement. You'll see the good, the bad, the ugly, and more truth bombs are dropped than you'll be able to process. Unlike most documentaries, this film doesn't need to make anyone look good, the content itself is so powerful the major points to the story are apparent for all to see.Yes, you'll get a glimpse the film's character's personal lives, but you'll also get a mid level view, then a bird's eye view of the fire problem sweeping across the western U. S. More than any of that, you'll see some of the best video of fire behavior anywhere. The footage is not like other video you've seen, it was only captured because the film's creator spent years imbedded with the crew to see the fire world through their eyes.",False
9,10,Artistic masterpiece,andymartin000,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's hard to say what Mr Mann intended here, which makes this all the more impressive. Not that I was confused or distracted. Quite the contrary. More to it, I was consumed, as if by fire. And maybe that's it. Maybe he was looking to create an immersive experience. If so, fire, or his seat at the fire is a breathtaking beautiful experience. The poetry and nuance of this production is pure music. And, as fits, for a documentary, a substantial education on nature's most powerful equalizer. We are reminded that as a planet, a people we were born of fire. You will see a 1,000 things you have never seen before, and though, the subject is God cursed fire, it is strangely gorgeous.",False
10,10,"Hotshot (2023) is an insightful, opinionated, visually stunning masterpiece.",echorelicart,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hotshot (2023) is a film is absolutely rife with some of the most incredible footage of California wildfires, quite possibly ever taken. But it's not simply enough for a film to have distinctly stunning visuals. Hotshot opts to be a uniquely informative film that covers a lot of significant issues in the exploitation of committed and determined Hotshop crews (or as the FED calls them:""forestry technicians"") who put their lives at risk weeks at a time to combat some of the most devastating wildfires in modern California history.As someone who grew up under the smoke filled shadow of and studied California wildfires myself, I find this film quite honestly to be one of maybe only two genuinely authentic deep dive documentaries into California wildfires in a way that documentary should but rarely do. (Fun sidebar-- even without the filmmakers explicit acknowledgement of which fires he'd film for certain shots, I was often able to tell which fires he'd filmed simply based on the landscapes and fire behavior he'd film. Most of these fires were filmed in the devistating 2019-2020 fire season. Mad props for showing up to the Apple Fire in Banning back in August 2020, Gabriel Kirkpatrick Mann.)There is however one aspect of the film i don't fully agree with and that is sort of the climate change denial that is occasionally sprinkled into the film. But I can't deny that while I may not agree with some of the climate aspects that this film occasionally presents, Hotshop very much makes up for that with countless far more informative hot takes on both the exploitation of hotshot crews by the US government, the reckless burn banning policies that has lead much of California to being in a decades-long burn-debt, and even exploitative nature of the media who rapaciously captures footage of wildfires for headlines regularly.It's a film that operates much unlike the standard documentary formula. There are no interviews with any set of individuals andno redundant graphics or statistics. There are simply an insightful and emotional monologues by the films creator, Gabriel Kirkpatrick Mann, throughout as they personally shoot incredible footage of countless wildfires and the equally incredible men and women who push their bodies and souls to the limit to fight the beast hand to hand. These monologues are often introspective as much as they are a critique on the wildland fighting world and lend itself to this film having a spark of soul much like wildfires themselves. Definitely worth the watch and definitely worth seeing again.",False

1,3,Pretentious,andrez-5,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerPretentious ""I and Antarctica at the background!"" documentary film.For documentary film it lacks facts, for feature film it lacks an idea. Many scenes are repetitive - ship's keel breaking ice again, and again, and again.Part of the trip was to fly to the southern pole and to film flags standing around it. That budget could be much better spent on a footage of Antarctica wildlife, and nature.At the same time the film is educationally useful - after watching it, it became obvious why Sir David Attenborough was so good in anything he did.I liked black and white choice and good camerawork though.",True

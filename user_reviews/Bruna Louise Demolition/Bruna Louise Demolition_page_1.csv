1,1,Gave up after 15 minutes,eunbi0530,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tiresome act with a draggy text, Netflix added too much laugh tracks because either people weren't laughing enough or their mics weren't capturing their laughter. Couldn't stand more 45 minutes of a lousy performance with a terrible material.",False
2,7,Brazilian naughty jokes - what's not to like?,ella_kelbert,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bruna Louise is a Brazilian comedian who started telling jokes on YouTube and gradually made her way into stand up comedy.In this special she talks about what women still have to deal with in the 21st century. She talks a lot about sexual encounters so maybe conservative people didn't like it much.A joke you will hear is, for example: ""the other day I had sex with a guy who then stole my TV to buy drugs. What upset me is that my Netflix was logged in and his drug dealer watches programs I don't like"".She makes some faces that aren't always funny but many jokes make you laugh a lot. So I really recommend it!",False

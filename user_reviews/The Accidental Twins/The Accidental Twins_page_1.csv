1,7,Accidental Error,DVK1234,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary chronicles the mistake that happened in a hospital in Bogotá, Colombia. One set of twins, Jorge and William, were born there. The other set, Carlos and Wilber, were born the next day in Santander. Carlos was ill, and had to go to NICU in Bogita. While there, he was accidentally mixed up with William, who needed up going home to Santander instead of Carlos. So two sets of identical twins were accidentally switched. A friend of Jorge realized that someone that was his doppelgänger was working at a butcher shop. That turned out to be his twin, William. They discovered that they each had a brother who looked identical to their twin brothers. Was it possible that a grave error was made back in the hospital in Colombia 25 years before?A story of hope, compassion and love. These two sets of twins now each have three brothers, not just one.I recommend this doc.",False
2,10,wow,splashwog,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, i just wathed this from Greece, sorry for my poor english, but I was moved to tears so many times from this story. This is such a beautiful film, im so glad i found this documentary randomly on netflix. What I watched for the last 90mins will stay with me forever. Four altruistic dudes and such an amazing story. Really emphasises issues like famil, brotherhood, blood relations, but more importantly?? It makes us realise blood is not everything. Brothers can be bro's without same blood. Im soooooo glad i watched this. If i myself found me in the same situation? I do not know how i would react. But i would want to believe that a brother is a brother, regardless of blood. This is a must watch!!!",False

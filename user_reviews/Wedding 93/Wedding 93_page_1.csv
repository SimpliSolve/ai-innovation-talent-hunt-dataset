1,10,masterpiece in cinema,kenshoukenzu,n/a,15/08/2025,This film should go down in history as extremely unique. The intensity and stress of the storyline creates a tension that has big payoffs throughout this movie.,False
2,9,Saw this at the Culver City film festival,fuzzyflower,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI saw this a few months back at the Culver city film festival in Southern California. I didn't see many people attending it which was probably expected. The festival had COVID-19 measures in place so you couldn't get in without the festival without proof of vaccinations. Which is nice, didn't want to be around a lot of people.About the film, not sure where to begin but keep in mind, this documentary is in the Khmer Language but it does have English subtitles which you can follow pretty easily. My overall experience about the film was good, but it did leave me with a lot of questions. I'm not Cambodian so I might not understand the culture but my main thing was why keep recording if there's a person in distress? If this is stage, I would understand but I get the impression that it's not. I had to do a Google search to see whether this was real or not. I couldn't find much information about the film. Here's a spoiler alert, there was a part in the film where she fell down from a tree. That was a real fall? It looked like it hurt. Also seeing her climb that tree did give me the creeps. I still have a lot of questions and I might try to watch it again and give it a more thorough review. It's not a long documentary so everything kind of went by fast.",True
3,5,Wedding tape.,morrison-dylan-fan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Finding Honeycomb (2022-also reviewed) to be the second film I saw at the Cine-Excess Festival, I started to hope that third time would be the charm, and got set to go to a wedding.View on the film:Note: Review contains some plot details.Not listing any of the cast and crew in the credits apart from the director/ producer, director Paul Zagaris tapes a very good Found Footage rough appearance, with the grainy, VHS warm fuzz overcoming forced jump-scares and the picking up the camera/ continuing to record when most people would run away, to successfully create a tense mood of being in the middle of an unfolding horror.Spliced together from (fake) wedding footage and interviews of a Cambodian wedding, the screenplay by the (un-credited) writer, keeps details on if the wife is possessed to a minimum, to instead focus on the more realistic horror of her being treated as a possession, forced into marriage shortly after the death of a close friend, with no family member caring about her well being, all at this 1993 wedding.",False

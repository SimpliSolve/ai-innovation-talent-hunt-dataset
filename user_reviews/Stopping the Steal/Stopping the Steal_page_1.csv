1,8,A litmus test for Americans still clinging to reality.,hqmqynmk,n/a,15/08/2025,"A comprehensive and narratively gripping recount of MAGA's attempts to pressure, intimidate, and smear Republican election officials into overriding the will of the American people. If you know anyone who didn't follow the events of the last election closely and still isn't quite sure what happened, I implore you to show this to them.Behind the act, the man portrayed in the testimonies here is the real Donald Trump. A dangerous, self-obsessed narcissist who would have never taken no for an answer - even if he'd decisively lost every state in the nation.Let it be a warning of things to come should we make the same mistake again.",False
2,8,"Chilling and horrifying, and a very timely reminder",paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""Stopping the Steal"" (2024 release; 90 min) opens, we are in Arizona, a key swing state in the 2020 presidential election, and the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, controlled by Republicans, are facing increased pressure to declare Trump the winner, even though he lost. At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: most critical in this documentary is that it is entirely seen and assessed from the Republicans' perspective. Not a single Democrat or independent voice is heard. Indeed, the remarkable thing is that the open and blatant attempt by Trump and his crew to throw out the will of the voters is thwarted primarily by... elected Republicans. We hear them time and again lamenting ""we're simply doing our job"". The documentary captures all the classis moments from election day to January 6, and to see it laid out so clearly is both chilling and horrifying. Of course we all know that Trump never has been, or is, or will be, a Republican. He simply hijacked the GOP for his own purposes and interests, and the GOP just let him do it. The timing of this documentary, released less than 2 months before the 2024 presidential election, is no coincidence of course. Already we see Trump cast doubt, every single day, that the election is ""rigged"". The fact that there is no evidence of that is of course nothing but a minor inconvenience, just like in 2020. It remains to be seen if our Republic can survive another open and blatant attempt to overthrow the will of the people...""Stopping the Steal"" started streaming on Max 10 days ago, and I finally found the time to watch it the other night. If you have any interest in politics, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
3,8,Surprised how good--and uplifting--this was,hf201-208-607317,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was hesitant to watch Stopping the Steal because I already knew how crooked the attempts to overturn the results of the election were. The likely outcome of my viewing, I thought, would only be further agitation at how many people bought the lies and took their displeasure to violent extremes. But I loved it and actually felt encouraged after watching it because A) it's very well done and B) I forgot and was partly unaware of how many heroes stepped up (Republicans, mind you) to ensure the election results were secure and ultimately honored. The makers went to the trouble of including a few Trump diehards who are still not convinced of the validity of the results, but their participation really just served as a reminder that there's still a range of opinions out there (regardless of how rational they may or may not be). People should know the names of the individuals who disregarded any sense of party allegiance in favor of allegiance to the process that makes America great--yes, already great.",False
4,9,Painful to Watch -A Must See,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,15/08/2025,"Anyone can make a film where they embolden confirmation bias by interviewing people and presenting evidence that only supports their own position. That is part of the disease of today's social media culture. The strength of this film is that it presents a hypothesis-that Donald Trump knew he lost the election, and there was no evidence to support it and proceeded anyway, from the position of pre-Trump supporters, State Officials, and Washington insiders. These people all wanted Trump to win, but they believed in truth more, The film shows how they were systemically targeted and vilified as they could not find any viable evidence to support the outrageous allegations made by the President's election team. It really is heart-wrenching to watch. Mike Pence, whom I was never a fan of, is a hero. He is a hero, for not only not overturning the election, but, as you will see, by not abandoning The Capitol while under siege, as he could have. This is a must watch.",False
5,10,"Great documentary, a must watch for everyone.",aesquiviambm,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is not a biased, Dem-Propaganda documentary. The people in this documentary are from people who were directly involved, and all Republicans. I highly recommend it and wish everyone would watch it. It does not have anyone from the Democratic Party, and does not have any Democrat voters. The people in this documentary are Trump Administration Staffers and Aides, and elected Republican Officials from states like Georgia and Arizona. It includes Republicans who were contacted in the weeks following the election, it includes Republicans who were on Trump's side.. but most importantly it shows the truth. It is absolutely a must watch documentary.",False
6,7,Good to see there are Still Republicans with a strong moral compass.,kellylangille-44180,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerIt's so clear the manipulation the Trump campaign was using to spread the lies that the election was stolen. The MAGA easily believing their cult leader. I feel sorry for the unwilling people that were tricked to believe the false allegations. It's heart warming and makes me believe that there are still strong patriotic republicans in the USA. Good for you for standing up against the extreme pressure to falsely agree that the election was stolen. I hope these man and women are held to the highest regard in history. Good bless them . And because of them. America is great And except for that time when a grifter and his entourage tricked a large percentage of vulnerable people. It always has been.,True
7,10,Most Interviewees are GOP Insiders,fayandray,n/a,15/08/2025,"How does anyone say this is a biased doc when there are no Dems, only Republican insiders that are interviewed? One really has to wonder about their critical thinking skills.I mean really, Bill Barr is part of a conspiracy? When he has admitted that he's voting for Trump in 2024? He's straight up telling the truth here. Everyone is, except the conspiracy theorists (who believe they're telling the truth). The doc has to include the conspiracy theorists in order to show why they believe the Big Lie. So be prepared to either be frustrated (left and ind) or confused (right and ind).I hope this doc gains traction because there are a ton of people (half the country) that need to be deprogrammed. They also need to watch the 60 Minutes segment on fake electors - it's what made me understand why this ""steal"" conspiracy is so insidious and egregious. It's really scary how easily they could have been successful. It behooves all of us to understand history, lest we repeat it.Thank god for Republican officials who have a moral compass and still believe in facts. Honestly, it's nice to see, because I had lost all faith in members of the GOP.",False
8,n/a,Entirely watchable but ones own bias determines the overall enjoyment.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerYeah i fell for it again hopeful to see a documentary with little bias.Don't get me wrong the overt bias in the presentation is fairly minimalized or more accurately hidden from plain view.Still its a long exercise in the usual limited inputs and only discussing half of the factors on a topic.It continues to make typical biased conclusions while not being overall wrong painting a far worse picture than reality in classical partisan biased fashion.They for example often make claims against its own premise. At times they might point out how there wasn't enough direct voter fraud to account for the steal claim.Naturally you link one piece of evidence to a following premise as support even though it is only partially in support of the erroneous premise to follow.Next they expand from not enough voter fraud found to account for a stolen election expanding that the election was entirely fair and proper.Naturally they don't include any discussion about the many factual problems discovered after the fact about illegal funding tech interference and more. Yet they will use a piece of information that covers only a fraction of the premise to support the whole. Its quite specifically like trying to tie down a tend with only one peg.Mind you i still remember the first day i noticed the vaunted tucker engaging in the same sort of false reasoning.Facts are its all biased and while you find an endless series of reviews telling you how it is or what to think all i want is for you to learn to recognize bias bad reasoning and how to see through it by practice.While i admit i am ever so moderately pro trump i could never quite swallow the steal notion myself as presented.The very idea that the election could have been stolen on voter fraud alone directly would of course have to be a conspiracy and turning point in governmental corruption becoming so pervasive one could no longer have any faith at all in any government leadership.This documentary is a fairly quality exercise however in recognizing clever well masked bias pretending to be an objective and informative discussion on the matter.Sadly it has one goal to sway the election outcome and public perception or reinforce existing ones.Another troubling scene was the general persistent vilification of all things trump and gop.Despite nothing happening the mere presence of citizens following their legal rights to be armed and protest are carefully described as ""making people very angry"" or some such feels nonsense.I found that to be the most hilarious crack in the sky. A politician or government representative being actually incensed merely over the peaceful exercise of peoples rights misguided or not.That tells the real whole story you need to know about government.Or perhaps rather the shameless depths of inconsistent ideologies from one party that is without fault or imperfection. The only party that has never known corruption or told a lie!The only thing being stolen is the ability for individual reasoning often from those who struggle generationally and familialy achieve it.",True
9,9,Trump is a fraud and a criminal,Bmore-Hero,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stopping the Steal is a gripping documentary that exposes the dangerous consequences of lies and manipulation in American politics. The film takes an unflinching look at the insidious ""Stop the Steal"" movement, spearheaded by none other than Donald Trump, a man who has shown a complete disregard for truth, democracy, and the American people.What makes this film so compelling is how it meticulously unpacks the events that followed the 2020 presidential election. It showcases how Trump's baseless claims of a rigged election were not only detached from reality but also a cynical ploy to cling to power. Watching his supporters-misled, emboldened, and manipulated-unfolds like a slow-motion train wreck, but the real tragedy is the damage done to the nation's democratic fabric. Trump, a man whose ego apparently outweighs any concern for the country, comes off as nothing more than a sore loser who weaponized lies for personal gain. His rhetoric has inflicted irreparable harm on trust in American institutions, leaving a trail of division, chaos, and violence.What elevates this film beyond mere documentation of events is its careful dissection of how Trump's narcissism fueled the entire movement. His refusal to accept responsibility is shocking but unsurprising. Stopping the Steal expertly captures his ability to exploit fear and stoke the flames of division-something he has been doing throughout his entire career.While the subject matter is disturbing, the filmmakers deserve immense credit for their sharp narrative and focus on the facts, driving home how easily the fragile nature of democracy can be shaken when leaders like Trump act without integrity or accountability.The only reason it's not a perfect 10 is that I wish they had gone even further in highlighting the ongoing repercussions of Trump's actions. The stain he's left on American politics, unfortunately, goes far beyond January 6th.In short, this is a must-watch for anyone who values truth and democracy, and a sobering reminder of what can happen when a man like Trump is given power.",False
10,1,May as well have been produced by The View,arizonathc,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was only a matter of time before HBO rolled out some thing like this. Of course.Let's see, how predictable can something be. Extremely. All of the normal suspects are in here, all of the pretend Republicans coming forward to make everything seem credible. It's not. Obviously.I feel when people who are Trump supporters say there are things being stolen and election interference. This is exactly what they mean. And it is 100% true. The entire media complex is designed to get everyone to vote against conservatism. It's very sad actually. Movies like this are the exact problem. It's all poisoning the brain and swaying the minds of simple people who get their politics from memes.",False
11,9,Surgical Removal of the Emperor's Clothes,mdknight-19617,n/a,15/08/2025,"The amazing effort Dan Reed put into this project is surpassed only by his brilliant result. It's the trial America has been needing. A verdict is soon to be rendered and this film will most certainly ensure a better outcome. Stopping the Steal was so engaging it was easy to lose sight of one's own perceptions and convictions; although, some extra name tags would have helped my brain recall all the players. The interview with Rusty Bowers stole the show and was especially inspiring. Of course, re-living Rudy Giuliani's drippage just made me lose my snot. In the end, it wasn't about presenting evidence, it was about revealing intent. Mr. Reed did the job well. Remaining denyers will either have to step out of their echo chambers and seek a new master, or find even more emotions to persuade with, because all reason has now been exhausted.",False
12,10,Character Matters,theerroco-97783,n/a,15/08/2025,"Shines a light on the courageous people (all of which are Republicans) who 'held the line' after the 2020 election and acted with honor and integrity. Stark warning at the end, to ensure that we elect honorable people who respect the rule of law and the constitution into positions of power. Somehow a large chunk of Americans don't seem to care about that going into the next election though ... this documentary serves as a good reminder of why you should care. We need documentaries like this to ensure that the shameful conduct and actions that many took part in after the 2020 election, culminating on January 6th, are not forgotten.",False
13,10,This man should be in jail,cubsbaseball-19103,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show shows even more so why people think Trumpers are a cult! They have no idea what to do or think unless their leader tells them. You guys blindly follow your leader regardless of what he does or says. He's done everything but kill someone in broad daylight and even then they would excuse it. No matter how many lies, disinformation or conspiracy theories with no facts he told, it doesn't matter to these people, they still follow and believed every word out of his mouth like it was gospel. They always say he didn't say it, and if he did say it then he didn't mean it, and if he did mean it then it's hey look at Kamala Harris or Joe Biden. The twice impeached felon Trump was a pathologically lying narcissistic who exploited democracy and the people.",False
14,10,How anyone can like this p.o.s. is mind boggling,uscfan-10927,n/a,15/08/2025,"Trump has had fostered hatred within our nation. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the minds of a significant portion of the population, he has convinced the more susceptible that their lack of happiness or success is a result of actions by those in the opposing party. He consistently portrays himself as a victim and consistently criticizes and intimidates anyone who opposes his quest for absolute power. Saw a great meme yesterday. Shows somebody interviewing Trump. The caption states ""Let me get this straight. You got fired from your last job as a top executive? Then you refused to leave called all your friends to vandalize the workplace, and on the way out of the office took a lot of the company's confidential documents. When you got caught you refused to give many of them back. And now you're reapplying for the same position?"" He talks like a child and thinks he knows everything. He's just a few of his highlights, ""I know more about the military than anyone."" ""I know more about the economy than anyone."" ""I know more about health care than anyone."" ""I alone can fix it."" He's going to to throw a tantrum when he loses again this November.",False
15,1,it's almost laughable,donaldjlynch-29009,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've read three different books on the 2020 election.And certainly a large volume of the claims made that the election was stolen were at best and exaggeration and at worst a complete misrepresentation.However,
There are many substantial verified claims including prosecution of individuals, who pursued illegal acts in the 2020 election.Let's forget that for a second.We know now for a fact that the hunter Biden laptop hoax was actually true and was actively suppressed as a story that would have easily swung the election the other way.This is not up for debate even the New York Times has verified this.The the 60+ court cases referenced in this movie has been found to support their claim that the election was fair and free is also laughable.They dismissed nearly all of them on standing.In other words, they didn't even look at the evidence.I recommend reading Mollie Hemingway's book ""rigged"" as the best volume on the election to show what I'm talking about. She's quite fair in showing where people got things wrong and certainly those issues are brought up in this movie.That's not the problem, it's what they left out,
and there's a lot of it.",False
16,10,Brilliantly Told and Fascinating,DisinterestedWisdom,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary fills in much that many people may have missed about the Trump efforts to overturn the election results at the state level (Arizona and Georgia in particular) in 2020, culminating in the 1/6 riots at the capital - the final, failed attempt to steal the election. Fascinating and authoritative, it features many of the individuals who were then responsible for delivering the elections in their respective states - for example Brad Raffensperger the republican Secretary of State of Georgia. That the plan was so deceptive, so cunning while at the same time so ham fisted is astonishing really and shows how ready the outgoing president was to sacrifice anyone in order to achieve his objectives.",False
17,10,Democracy Prevailed on Jan 6th,fluffcat,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary shows that it was clear-eyed American patriots who held the line against Donald Trump's corrupt pressure, amplified by his phalanx of liars and bullies in the days after the 2020 election through the January 6th attack on the electoral certification. It illuminates the undeniable courage displayed by state-level election officials who did their jobs without fear or favor because of their moral convictions. It also shows that Democracy is a fragile thing. Be very careful who you choose to sit in the White House, America. There may not be enough clear eyed American patriots available or willing to hold the line next time.",False
18,10,Save our Republic,Odgencr,n/a,15/08/2025,This is so hard to watch. This selfish man went very far to try to stay in power and he abused his followers for his coup attempt.We were lucky there were Republicans that maintained their oath to the Constitution BUT we won't have that in a potential second Trump administration in which he will be surrounded of only his minions.The documentary is good at retelling the facts with commentary of key actors and some of the footage we all have watched but that unfortunately many have forgotten or don't want to remember.I hope the USA will recover from Trump's toxicity in politics and his undermining of the American democratic institutions.,False
19,10,Who knew HBO was so fantastic!,nzdavidmiddleton,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Stopping the Steal"" is an exceptionally balanced documentary that explores the widely accepted integrity of the 2020 presidential election making it the most secure given Trumps promise to do so after the reported loss of the popular vote in 2016.The film offers a fair examination, portraying republicans as they should be whilst acknowledging their contributions and dispelling myths surrounding the election.It provides a well-rounded view, much like a pizza with an array of toppings-representing various viewpoints and evidence.For viewers seeking a thorough understanding of the events, this documentary serves as an insightful resource.By all accounts, this movie inevitably and demonstrably needed to be created and helps us all stay well informed especially this close to the election.The directors are clearly very concerned about Americans' discernment and thus, this is a must watch.Especially for Republicans.",False
20,1,A One-Sided Narrative That Misses Key Points,vermaakpetrus,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary Stopping the Steal claims to offer a detailed look into the events following the 2020 election, but it falls short by failing to present a balanced perspective. While it focuses heavily on dismissing claims of election fraud, it ignores the legitimate concerns of millions of Americans who felt something was off in the process.First, the documentary overlooks the irregularities that were reported in several key swing states. Many people were concerned about the rapid changes in election laws, last-minute rule changes, and the unprecedented expansion of mail-in voting during a pandemic. These were real issues that deserved thorough investigation, but instead, the documentary brushes them off without giving them serious consideration.It also fails to address the sheer volume of affidavits and testimonies from poll workers and voters who witnessed questionable behavior at polling places. These claims weren't just fringe theories; they came from regular people who felt disenfranchised and deserved to be heard. Dismissing them as conspiracy theorists only deepens the divide in the country.Moreover, the documentary seems more intent on discrediting Trump supporters than examining why so many people believed something went wrong. Whether or not widespread fraud occurred, the concerns raised by these Americans should have been explored more thoughtfully, rather than reduced to a simple ""debunking"" exercise.In a time when trust in institutions is already fragile, it's essential for documentaries like this to present all sides fairly. Stopping the Steal misses the mark by failing to engage with the concerns of those who felt their voices were dismissed, making it feel more like propaganda than an objective analysis of a deeply complex issue.",False
21,10,Everyone needs to see how republican officials were attacked,tomthomas-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Every single voter needs to be made aware of the actual events, documented here, that went down after the 2020 election.I felt the film was well referenced, factual, and included testimony by many officials that were all involved in the aftermath of the election and the denial of the results by Donald Trump. Just mentioning that name causes many people to automatically make a judgment that this film is part of the ""witch hunt"" against said person, but there are plenty of testimonies of former allies here. These are people that are staunch Republicans, just stating the facts of what happened.",False
22,1,More twisted edited hitpieces against Trump,stevepaluch,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's obvious to ANYONE who does real research into all the voter fraud & election interference from the 2020 USA election that it was stolen. One simply has to ignore all the lies CNN & the Left keeps pushing.Attempts on his life, invasion of his home, lies & kangaroo courts after him 247 which are thrown out & proven as targeting him for running against the Left.Stand Tall America, Dominion systems & the Leftist cheat are not on our side !!!!This year, 2024, there have been more ciminal attempts at smearing or even ending President Trump for fear that once he is in office SO MANY evil criminals of the swamp & music/Movie industry will fall.",False
23,1,Terrible,jdigg-50964,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI can't believe this. It was like watching a car accident, so bad but I couldn't look away. I wish they wouldn't do this right before an election. It just doesn't feel right and I think it shows how much the media really does affect things like elections. I don't believe it was fair the way they portrayed trump. They didn't show anything about the other candidate. So why do we need this terrible view of Donald trump aired on tv right before an election. The producers were clearing against Donald trump whether republican or democrat it didn't matter and it was unfair. I think any fair person would see this.",True
24,1,"We saw, we laughed",prolead,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well, as an outsider who is not from the US, the 2020 elections was a complete mockery of the election system in the US. Things that we only experience in third world countries was live on TV for the whole world to see. It wa so obvious that the US elections were stolen from Trump and the Democrats lost badly. Yet, the media and the Democrats somehow wanted to push the picture that a Senile old man that could not get a room full of people to his rallies actually won with an overwhelming majority. LOL. That was the day the world understood what a joke the US was becoming and what a joke the election system was.",False
25,2,That was awful,jaysmoke,n/a,15/08/2025,"The low number of comments here truly is inspiring. Thank God the American people aren't falling for this shameful piece of work.The only thing Donald Trump and his team were wrong was actually thinking they could overturn a rigged election. I mean, do you even know the shear scale of implications surrounding such an event if found to be true? So many people would have to be rounded up and put in jail.The only way to win, is to win by a huge gap, so big that they can't rig it and I hope that this election does that, if not, they can forget it. They rigged it whilst you are in office, how much more now that they are in office.",False

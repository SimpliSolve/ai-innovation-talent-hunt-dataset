2,10,Fascinating historical account of the battle of Amritsar,sukiworld-54314,n/a,15/08/2025,"A must watch for the whole Sikh/Punjabi diaspora. Actually- for the whole of India, because events are replaying themselves with the current government. A very well-made documentary with great use of graphics and interviews to show the Background to and the build up to the 1984 battle between freedom loving Sikhs and a vindictive, oppressive and genocidal government.",False

5,10,A sensational documentary filled with facts and truth,navrupkaur-50179,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is so well made. The documentary's starting point is key to helping the viewer understand the true narrative of what took place in June 1984.The detail is phenomenal, allowing the viewer to step into this time in sikh history and gain a better understanding of the sacrifices, bravery and comradery of the Sikhs.The subtitles are brilliant with my 7 year old and 13 year old able to follow the entire film. Both audio and visually - I haven't seen anything like this in the sikh sphere before !Watch it now!",False
6,10,An emotional and empowering reflection.,manks-34431,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary experience is an emotional and empowering navigation through the intense days of the greatest battle fought by Sikhs in the 20th century. We hear first-hand witness accounts with the most compelling revelations which has never been shared on screen with actual detailed chronology from 1st to 6th June 1984 .The documentary introduces us to the sophisticated tactical and strategic positioning of the Sikh resistance scattered around the entire Harmander Sahib complex and ensures the context and build up to 1984 is also presented and clearly articulated by historians, from precursor events to the legacy of the battle today.",False

8,10,Well constructed and highly recommend,sutejsingh,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was pleasantly surprised by this documentary. It can't cover everything relating to the events of 1984, but does a good job with the areas covered even going as far back as 1920 to provide a context. Emotional and eye opening at times with information I was not aware of from eye witness accounts. I cannot recommend this documentary enough and give thanks to the team behind the project. This will enlighten the current generation and empower future generations so is a must watch.",False

11,9,How to watch it in India,gurvinderpalsinghgps,n/a,15/08/2025,"Tried really hard to watch it in India but was unsuccessful. If anyone knows the method to watch it in India kindly reply to this review.Being from the Sikh community I need to watch it to understand the late 20th century era in India particularly in punjab. Punjab has suffered immensely in the past 40 to 50 years and that can be experienced in the environment and the air. But still Punjab and Punjabis stand tall against all adversities and provide food to other parts of the country , prepare their youngest population to serve in the Indian army . No where in the world we can see this kind of sacrifice!",False
12,6,"Good effort, missing vital details",Agency9893,n/a,15/08/2025,Overall a very good effort on a grassroots level to tell the other side of the narrative (vs White Paper). Film/documentary fails to address two major points for viewers: 1. Why did Jarnail SIngh Bhindranwale migrate to the Akal Takht? 2. Why should we care about Operation Bluestar today? What relevance does it have in our lives? What can we learn from this annual observance? What do we gain from reflecting every year instead of just forgetting about it?Film does have important details and does well to appeal on an emotional level to viewers. Trailer gives too much away and leaves only emotional ramblings left in the film.,False

1,6,never flip a coin...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"That you cannot hold on to, its a complex story of decieft and murder within the league of cryptocurrencies,and how governmental agencies strives and fumbles like a blind wallaby whitewashed with bleech called shell companies and dark matter of the web searching for money that arent there other than the fantasy pockets of a criminal monopoly player, well worth viewing.",False
2,7,Well done documentary,Snakeskinzjr,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had never heard of QuadrigaCX , so the subject was interesting to me from the start. The film does not answer all the qustions , because the investigation is ongoing. You will definately come away with your own opinion as to what happened to the money and is Gerald Cotten dead or alive? At the very least the audience is left with a sense that something shady and dishonest was happening with Gerald Cotten, Quadriga, and his ex felon partner Michael Patryon. I thought the film was very well made , and was engaged till the very end . Wether you are familiar with cryptocurrency or not you will definately learn from this documentary, that the industry is ripe for fraud and abuse. I would recommend.",False
3,8,Great soundtrack,didier-20,n/a,15/08/2025,This story still requires a part 2 because the insinutation is that the story is far from over. The real treat here is the for-purpose designed soundtrack by Sung Tien Kao and co which really needs some exposure. Up the soundtrack onto youtube and do yourselves a favour folks.,False

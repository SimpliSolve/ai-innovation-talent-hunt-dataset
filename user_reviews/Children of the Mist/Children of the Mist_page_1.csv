1,9,Kicking and Screaming,wasabiteabag,n/a,16/08/2025,"Torn between rural cultural traditions and the status quo in Vietnam. As an outsider looking in, it's hard to see what is right for the people in that community, but I do believe it's a universal rule that when someone (female) is kicking and screaming whilst getting dragged away (by men) is absolutely wrong.",False
2,10,From a Vietnamese person: An incredible documentary,blisteryfingers,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis review will be more on the personal side, as I believe other reviews from critics have already said all there is to say. As a Vietnamese person (born and raised in Vietnam), I find this documentary very impressive and delicately done. On the surface it's about a teenager who's fighting against an outdated tradition of bride kidnapping - but the mindset portrayed echoes the gender imbalance and discrimination that my own mother and her grandmother went through, just one/two generations ago. And so I feel deeply sympathetic and surprisingly relatable to the characters.I'm not sure how a Western or Western-educated audience would understand the nuances of the dynamics of the family. To me it echoes my own relationship with my parents - they've had such a hard life, and it's not a cultural norm for them to be emotionally aware about their vulnerability and feelings with their children. So they switch between words of advice from one moment to shouting harsh words in the next. I don't doubt their love, but there are certain things they cannot escape from.A little about the director: She came from another ethnic minority herself (TÃ y) while the ethnic majority of Vietnamese people are the Kinh people.As for the fate of Di after the film: According to an interview, she got married at 17, to a person she loves.",True
3,2,From a Hmong person: Exploitative and borderline unethical documentary,thaohm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Director Ha Le Diem should receive some credit for shining light on the harrowing practice of bride napping among the Hmong ethnic minority group in Northern Vietnam, but her attempt is exploitative and her post-production decisions unethical.Viewers may be easily fooled given that Director Diem and the other Vietnamese characters are Asian like the Hmong family front and center, but there are long-standing power dynamics at play that the documentary does not address. The Hmong ethnic minority community portrayed is poverty-stricken, living in the uninhabitable, resource-deprived hills of Vietnam. You then have a Vietnamese director and some Vietnamese teachers who come in to try to ""save"" a poor, uneducated little girl from her own community. Switch the Vietnamese characters with White people and you can easily see the white savior framing bulldoze through.The most problematic issue with this documentary is the harmfully incorrect English captions and apparent lack of cultural competency involved in post-production. At best, the Hmong to English translations are 70% accurate. Diem and her translation ""team"" chose to insert vulgar language to portray ""crass"" parents who don't care about their daughter, protagonist Di. As examples, Diem and team liberally added F-words to the Hmong mother and father's dialogues when there is no such equivalent word in the Hmong language. The team sprinkles in derogatory and misogynistic remarks when the parents address their pre-teen daughter, but these words were never said. There's high doubt that a professional translator was used at all, given the lack of culturally competent translations. It's unclear whether intentional or not, but the sinister translations and depictions of the parents frame them as 'bad guys' to blame for the bride napping. This has fueled the popularity of this documentary. If you thought the documentary flowed like a film, the framing is likely intentional - to the detriment of Di and her family.If you never read the English captions and rely solely on the Hmong conversations, you'll find that Di's parents care about their daughter like any other parent would. They nag and tell her to stay away from boys - she's too young. They tell her to help around the house but let her be on her phone. They cry and are sad when they realize she might be getting married. In a poverty-stricken society with no support from the government, Hmong subsistence farmers rely heavily on the financial and social support of other Hmong families. Di's parents were stuck between a rock and a hard place: they want to dissolve the bride napping for their daughter, but they don't want to be ostracized by their community of Hmong families in doing so when word gets out. It's not as simple as not wanting to ""lose face"" - as many ""professional,"" culturally incompetent critics would like to believe.The second problematic issue with Diem is the consent and boundaries she crossed over and over again while filming. Numerous times, when told to stop, she turned her camera back on to film. She was never a fly in the wall as she so wanted to believe. Her opinions and actions directly impacted the protagonist family.It's appalling that this documentary is short-listed for the Oscars. If Diem wants to provide some justice to the poor Hmong family that welcomed her into their homes for 3 years, she should hire a fluent Green Hmong and English translator and overhaul the captions completely. If she wants to be a better documentarian, she needs to think deeply about power dynamics and cultural competency.Heck, the easiest first step is to stop calling the protagonist ""Di"" in English. Her name is Jee (pronounced like the letter G).",False

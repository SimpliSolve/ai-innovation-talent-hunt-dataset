1,8,"A fascinating portrait of a prickly, obsessive musical genius...",mdw0526,n/a,16/08/2025,"You may not know Diane Warren's name, but you definitely know at least one of her songs. ""Relentless"" is an apt title for this sharp, revealing documentary about the hit-making machine behind power ballads for everyone from Celine to Cher. Warren is a prickly, obsessive genius: deeply routine-driven, proudly on the spectrum, and having never been in a relationship, yet capable of writing about love in ways that resonate across decades and genres. The film doesn't sand down her edges, but instead leans into them, showing how single-minded drive can fuel greatness. If you're even remotely curious about the people behind pop music's biggest moments, make time for this one. And watch next year to see if she's been nominated for an Oscar; she's been nominated 15 times, including the past six years in a row, but has never won one.",False
2,10,A true story of an unknown woman whose music entertained millions.,amreinfeld,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is so interesting as it follows the life of Diane Warren. I had never heard of her but knew and loved many of her songs.It has a well known cast of singers, entertainers and others in the music business whose names we all know.It is the story of a woman who was different than her friends and who because of some of her differences was urged to become a secretary or a teacher but followed her own path.It's her story of growing up in California with two much older sisters. Her early educational life is somewhat troubled as she did not like school. If she wanted her grades could be excellent but if not they were barely passing.Her persistence never failed her.I highly recommend it.",False

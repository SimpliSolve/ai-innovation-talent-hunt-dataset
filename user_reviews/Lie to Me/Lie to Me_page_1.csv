1,7,Blockchain Docu,loveankerry,n/a,15/08/2025,"The clever title places the responsibility for lying on the subject who is defrauded, as a statement of the way in which it is easy to lie because others allow themselves to be lied to. This idea is represented in the last part of the film when, after numerous arrests and some murders related to the OneCoin scam, the rebirth of the company continues to attract investors who have even lived through that entire chaotic process. This is the main topic of a documentary that manages to clarify some basic concepts, such as what the hell a blockchain is, but that becomes unbalanced in an execution in which it doesn't seem to be clear whether to take the matter as a joke or seriously. Too many times the director uses film clips and archive images as visual support, such as when a situation similar to a spy movie is referenced with an image of James Bond. But these resources are not only unnecessary, they don't contribute to the effectiveness of the moments when he wants to get serious.",False
2,9,Definitely worth watching,heikkihy,n/a,15/08/2025,"So, stumbled upon this as freebie on YouTube. But that just sweetens the deal. I'd very much recommend it if you're interested in multilevel marketing schenanigans, or crypto fraud. But under that it's still a human story of the fates of the participants, and the grim manipulations of the scammers.The documentary takes many angles, from victims to a mufti who issued a fatwa on OneCoin. Of course, the investigators are front and centre in the story.This is a well-structured documentary. Obviously the verdict is already out, we know that it was a scam all along. But this documentary still brings worthwhile stuff on the table.",False

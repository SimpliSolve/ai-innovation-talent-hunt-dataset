1,7,Wolfs can't skateboard...,tlght,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI remember a friend of mine telling me I had to see this movie. An eyeopener on todays youth (in 1995). The movie unsettled me for multiple reasons. Mostly for seeing kids that were left to themselves in 90s NY.I did not like the initial movie at all and seeing this documentary puts the 1995 movie even more into that perspective (manipulative toxic sensational piece of polarize gar...). The shock value was the big effect on the audience, with giving the impression that, that the younger generation, was going into a bad direction. The 1995 movie looks so much like a documentary. It feels like we are in those kids intimacy, instead of the directors/writers perspective and intellectual property overreach.I'm happy I saw the documentary, it rectifies what was implied about that group of individuals. Showing a more transparent background and what those kids were trying to build, a pseudo-family, is so much more inspiring and interesting.",True
2,8,Very good doco with a wholesome but sad reveal at the end and shows Larry Clarke and Harmony Korine for who they really were..,glencoe-96237,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGood documentary and yes a lot of it paints Larry Clarke and his sidekick, Harmony Korine, in a bad light, but one can't help to think they deserve it after they exploited the main cast.Larry Clark has always come across as creepy, even though as a photographer I can see why he hang out with his subjects to study every little thing they were doing at the time.But once he got what he wanted, he bailed and so did Korine. To then show up the way they did at the film festivals sans the leading actors was too obvious of what they had done. But then again listening to Larry at the press conference not being able to even articulate the reasons why he made such a raw movie sums up Larry Clarke.I think the end reveal was nice. I have to wonder why Justins mother kept who his father was for a long time. Things would have certainly been different if she allowed Justin to know who his real dad was. I guess distance played a huge role as well.As for the reviewer asking where were the two other girls? Well we know now Chloe was Korines gf and we all know what Korine made Chloe do in front of the camera a decade after this was shot. So it just could be Chloe wanted nothing to do with appearing in this doco because of the trauma she might still being going through after what Korine made her do.",True
3,8,The Shocking Truth,Ms_Carter,n/a,16/08/2025,"So after watching KIDS
I was looking up Justin Pierce
Because I was fairly sure I had seen him in some other movies
Anyway this documentary about the movie came up
So I decided to watch it
(Not that it changed my opinion of KIDS)
But it did make me feel bad about what the actors went through
Larry Clark is a low life scum of the earth
Who took advantage of street kids with little or no education
It was tragic to learn of the deaths of Justin Pierce and Harold Hunter
Very informative and interesting documentary
I would highly recommend watching this
Strictly my opinion
But I think it's better than the actual movie.",False
4,n/a,It could have been shorter,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a good documentary that, unlike what typical bros from IMDB would say, is not for ""the era of whine"". It does talk about the entire cast, even those who someone says here are suspiciously silent, but this is not about the rest of the teenagers who were part of the cast. It's about those who had the power and basically used the life stories (AND IMAGES) of these kids, while filming them naked and using drugs. I have never been a fan of Harmony Korine, and now I dislike him even more. The creepy aura around Larry Clarke does not surprise me. This old dude talking with a teenager about another grown man wanting oral sex seems more like a way to bring that topic up. I do believe that Hamilton Harris, being the writer, wasn't able to objectively edit many of his conversations. The monotone can get a little bit tired.It's not the best, but it's worth watching, especially for those who are unable to put themselves in the shoes of teenagers from ""the wrong side of the tracks"" (Of course, that's not the user base of this site)",False
5,6,Adds some very interesting context to Kids.,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've not watched Kids since it was released. I was 18 and it shocked me. It shocked a lot of people. I'd not seen anything like it. No one had. What is this? Was a common question? Is this real? Was another. Whether you liked it or not, there's no denying it was fresh and thought provoking. We Were Once Kids is a documentary about the film, its cast and its production. I've wanted to see this for a while, but it's not easy to find in the U. K. In fact it's near impossible, I had to watch on DocPlay via a VPN. Kids is quintessential 90s, but as this doc explains, it's about youth born into 70/80s New York. A place to aspire escape from. That escape is skate culture, bringing people of all types together. One of the big questions of Kids was, where are the parents? These kids are wild! The truth is the parents were wilder. Drugged up or dead as crack exploded through the city. Much of this back story comes from writer Hamilton Harris, he had a smaller role in the film, but he's a big part of this documentary. Painting a vivid picture of a society that's the very definition of dysfunctional. So was it real? Yeah kinda. Some of these people were friends before the cameras rolled. More than that, they were family, replacing what was absent at home. It's fascinating to hear how organically it grew. Kids bonding over skating, weed, a simple need to have someone to hang out with. Hamilton, meets Harold Hunter, Harold introduces Harmony (Korine) a kid from out of town. Tobin Yelland is hanging around and introduces an older dude, Larry Clark into the mix. He runs a photography workshop, loves skateboards, wants to make a film. You can see where this is going. It's all a joke to begin. Larry's gonna shoot a movie, Harmony's gonna write it, we're all gonna be in it. Just a laugh right? Not everyone from the film speaks here and some like Leo Fitzpatrick who played Telly tellingly doesn't feature at all, others are referred to via archive footage alone and there's a lot of archive. Like Justin Pierce, who it's said always wanted to act, he's not interviewed as he took his own life at the age of 25, but he and Harold (who also died young) are the ringmasters, bringing kids to Larry to be cast in the film. It's weird, they know it's weird. Who's this old dude hanging around with a bunch of kids. But it's exciting for them and what else are they going to do? That is unless you're a girl. Highlyann Krasnow (great name) reads Harmony's script and clocks it for its ""rape and misogyny"". She wants no part, so the casting net widens. Enter people like Jon Abrahams, who talks about going with the flow, doing what Larry says, being stoned while shooting. Javier Nunez, no idea how old he was at the time but very young, smoking a load of joints then passing out. Honestly it's troubling. Most of these kids were from broken homes, vulnerable and it's clear they were taken advantage of. The shoot wraps. They watch a screener and have a party, sign some papers, except some cash. ""We were left where we started from"". The film goes to festivals and boom! What are these kids doing on screen? How old are they? Are they old enough? Larry Clark doesn't have the answers, because clearly some of them are not. To him, it's just a movie, but it's not is it. It feels real because so much of it is, there's no fluff, it's handheld lofi doc style screams authenticity and it connects. In America at least, audiences bond with it in the same way that those kids bonded before Larry even turned up. The fallout is intense. Some feed off it, like Harold who laps up the limelight, others feel exposed and used. Others choose to distance themselves from everyone. ""I remember watching Harmony transform into a person I didn't recognise"". The leads, Justin, Jon, Harold, Rosario Dawson, ChloÃ« Sevigny, all have opportunities, it's a stepping stone. Everyone else, it's a dead weight. The movie is a hit. It makes millions. Guess who's cashing in... and who's not. It's a tragic story and very little positive comes from Kids. We Were Once Kids is enlightening, but it's not an easy watch and with that in mind, now I'm going to rewatch Kids.",False
6,9,This is an essential companion to Kids,christidal,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched kids when it came out, being a kid myself, when I was 16 years old. The movie itself was kinda weird, though watching these kids was impressive. The storyline was total nonsense, evem to a 16-year-old. What was much more memorable was when my friend and me got out of the cinema, we were attacked by two kids who had riled themselves up watching the movie. Not a nice experience. Now this documentary felt to me like the missing piece to Kids. We used to skate, too, and like the actors describe it here, it was indeed our only way to be productive and not get into trouble. Obviously, living in a small town in Germany, we weren't nearly growing up in such dire conditions as them, but skating did mean that much to us, too.It was interesting and sad to see how ""Kids"" impacted qnd changed these kids' lives, kimnd of destroying the feeble ""community"" that they had built themselves around skating. Had a much more profound effect on me that watching Kids back in the day.",False
7,9,Will Change Your Perspective,leriwid,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've always been a fan of kids. The period in New York this film depicts and the skate culture is what initially drew me in. I know that it is a controversial film, but I always assumed that it was because of the subject matter being shown. While there is nothing lighthearted about the subject matter I was unaware of the total lack of respect and taking advantage of the kids in the film. It is heartbreaking to watch as they are left in the dust while Larry Clarke takes all the credit and money. Hamilton Hariss does an incredible job at explaining everything that has happened to these kids. If you have scene kids you should watch this as well.",False
8,9,Well worth a watch for fans,chrislawuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"I did not know about the death of 2 of the lead characters. I have to say it is not really surprising. Coming from that background and environment, it was highly likely going to happen to some of them.I grew up in a small town in Scotland, and many of my friends I grew up with are now dead at 45; suicide, drugs, the same old same old. Like a universal principle unfortunately. The location changes, but the stories the same. It can be easy to shift blame, but drug addiction and broken families were the largest factors I suspect in their early death. This is not to say that Hamilton is wrong. My feelings are that the movie helped some of the cast in the long run, and had unintended consequences for others. Over all though, was the effect positive or negative? Without stepping foot in an alternative reality, we will never know for sure. Changed the course of participants lives for sure.For sure they were under paid, but at what point does Harmony and Larry's responsibility end. There were a lot of kids in that movie to adopt. Maybe its a glass half full, half empty scenario. I see them all as legends: cast and crew.I thank the cast of Kids and all the crew members, as it was a important movie for me, and film that really made me think. Unfortunately the camera verte approach, simply could not have been replicated through paid professional cast members.Kids was a bold movie, and many do say unethical. From my view, a part of cultural history would be missing without this movie. No one would ever know in future generations what it was like to grow up as an underprivileged kid in New York in the 90's.Fantastic movie, fantastic follow up documentary. I'd be up for watching more if they can get hold of more cast and crew.",False
9,8,Touching,jfo-95056,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie kids, tho great in many ways, is an emotionless affair. Literally characters who find out they have aids don't cry, they just kinda panic. Nobody seems to, or is depicted to, feel anything in that world.We Were Once Kids is like the photo negative of that. It's emotionally raw, very vulnerable, pathetic even, embarrassing. And I mean all that as a compliment. Here we see young men grappling honestly with regrets, unrealized dreams, friendships, and new realities, they aren't too cool to walk us through the process of finding adult perspectives on hard childhoods, lost childhoods, opportunities - particularly one stinging reveal that was and is forever lost. Even cast wise: the side characters are the stars, the stars mostly absent.It's a great depiction of the chance to be in the moons orbit and never getting to land there. The filmmakers are in tremendous company.",False
10,5,It is what it was.,fogofanalog,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't believe Larry Clark had a hidden agenda. He clearly was in awe of how this crew of loyal skaters were living life raw and unedited. It was after meeting and reading Harmony Korine's screenplay he felt it had potential to be a full length motion picture. So turning to his connections in the film industry such as Gus Van Sant, for example to make it happen. At this point is when i felt some of the cast got taken advantage of in terms of pay being the classic it still it to date but on the other hand $1,000 is a considerable amount for those who hardly had any screen time. I don't agree with Clark turning ghost after filming completed since it was a community of people who value friendship, loyalty and commitment from eachother. I understand life moves on for everyone but I'm sure some of the kids just felt dismissed by Larry & Harmony. But neither should be a scapegoat for anyone's failed career since half the cast are now very well established actors/actresses. This is my outsiders perspective, for what it's worth.",False
11,5,no Chloe?,jonmichaelkieran,n/a,16/08/2025,"As much I otherwise enjoyed this little documentary, it is incomplete without including Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson. As another reviewer here wrote, there isn't a single scene, clip, photo or even name-drop of them in this entire film. It's almost as if their lawyers and managers threatened to shut down this entire project if their likeness appeared anywhere in it.At the end, there is a note that says Larry Clark and Harmony Korine refused to participate in this project, but obviously SO DID Chloe and Rosario, so what's your point? Leo Fitzpatrick also isn't anywhere in this, not even his name!So how are we supposed to interpret that? Seems there is some bad blood between those ""kids"" who found Hollywood success after, and those who were left behind.All in all, it's worth a watch - but anyone expecting behind-the-scenes film-making insight into the making of Kids will be disappointed. The actual production of Kids is glossed over in under 5 minutes; the rest of this doc is a hit piece against Clark and Korine and also a portrait of Justin Pierce and Harold Hunter's tragic pre- and post-Kids lives.",False
12,1,ChloÃ« Sevigny and Rosario Dawson's silence is suspicious,jojalyde,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would like to know why ChloÃ« Sevigny, Rosario Dawson, and Leo Fitzpatrick were given hall passes on their culpability in the demise and deaths of Justin Pierce and Harold Hunter?Not only did ChloÃ«, Rosario and Leo (the only actors/stars to emerge successful out of Kids) duck out of being interviewed for this doc, but their names are not even mentioned once. And I mean literally NO mention of them AT ALL, as if they never appeared in Kids.Instead, the producers and director chose to focus their ire and blame strictly on Larry Clark and Harmony Korine, holding the duo over the fire for abandoning their ""kids"" so that they could reap all the accolades and financial fruits for themselves. And in doing so - this documentary argues - Pierce and Hunter were left all alone to flounder and eventually fail (Justin later killed himself and Harold OD'd).I don't think anyone disagrees that Clark and Korine exploited their cast of then-unknown street urchins in order to get Kids made. And after watching this doc, you'd be hard pressed to defend (or even like) Larry Clark (Korine was equally heartless in his unscrupulous treatment of the Kids cast, but unlike Clark he's still making $$$ for Hollywood, so I think people are a bit more lenient of him as Clark's former accomplice).But it seems grossly unfair of this doc's filmmakers to have such a blatant double-standard of blame - that Clark and Korine could have but didn't help Justin and Harold get set up in Hollywood following the success of kids - all the while categorically ignoring just how huge ChloÃ« Sevigny and Rosario Dawson went on to become in La La Land.Seriously, where were ChloÃ« and Rosario when Justin Pierce and Harold Hunter were also trying to get roles? And where were they when Justin and Harold, having failed to make it in show business, fell on hard times? Sure, you could argue that ChloÃ« and Rosario had no responsibility for them and were just looking out for themselves as they became popular in Hollywood (both actresses are now A-listers and multi-millionaires).But then you'd need to grant Clark and Korine the exact same exemption, because they too had no obligation to help out the cast after paying them. After all, at the time Clark and Korine were just two scruffy wannabe filmmakers trying to make it in this industry. Not until years (and decades for Korine) later did they finally find some success.In fact, if you examine and compare their respective career timelines, ChloÃ« and Rosario were cast in big-budget Hollywood movies immediately after Kids - long before Clark or Korine found enough financing to make their second films. So who at the time really had the ability and opportunity to help out Harold and Justin?Again I ask: why did the producers and director of ""The Kids"" (aka ""We Were Once Kids"") choose to let ChloÃ« Sevigny, Rosario Dawson and Leo Fitzpatrick off the hook by not forcing them to face the camera and ask them the same hard questions asked of Clark and Korine? And not just let them off the hook, but completely leave them out of this doc with nary a whisper of their names? (the end of the film states in writing that Clark and Korine declined to participate; since Sevigny and Dawson also declined to participate, why doesn't it say so?).Re-watch this documentary with all this in mind and I think their agenda/narrative will make itself more obvious to the viewer: Clark and Korine were low-hanging fruit, but to also go after Sevigny and Dawson would have risked upsetting the Hollywood powers-that-be who finance their films and have the ability to crush aspiring indie filmmakers like Eddie Martin and Hamilton Harris.I personally think it's shameful and hypocritical, but y'know, I doubt anyone else will ever think this deep about this relatively obscure documentary...",False

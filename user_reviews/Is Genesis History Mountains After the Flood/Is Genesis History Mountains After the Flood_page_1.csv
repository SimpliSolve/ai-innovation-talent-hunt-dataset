1,3,Nice cinematography for faulty beliefs,hoveydn,n/a,16/08/2025,Excellent filming for some really outlandish creationism beliefs. Really enjoyed the great shots of Utah and Arizona's scenic wilderness areas but the film falls apart with trying to convince everyone of the Noah's flood theory. To me they fail with their soft rock fast creation by collapsed lakes theories. At least we don't have to hear how it was created 5000 years ago during the film even if they do keep mentioning the flood (as it pertains to Noah) to try and convert you to their beliefs. Can't give a high rating to a film centered on propaganda but it is worth watching for the cinematography.,False
2,1,Desperate lies that will fool some,shanerodneyarnold,n/a,16/08/2025,"Truly appalling nonsense that is a disgrace to our collective intelligence. It would be laughable if it wasn't so dangerous. These are desperate lies that will fool some, and for that we must stand up against this evil.1 star for the wide shots, they're quite beautiful, and inversely proportional to the propaganda in this film. Religion has been a stain on all humankind for thousands of years, and this is yet more evidence. The producers should be ashamed of themselves, as no doubt some who were involved with the production would be.Look for their next so-called documentaries - The Earth Is Flat, Witchcraft Is Real, Vaccines Send You To Hell.",False
3,10,Excellent analysis of rock folds!,gmorganhome,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI loved Mountains after the Flood! It tells of the collection of rock fold samples and the analysis that shows that the sediment was clearly soft when the folding occurred. From the trip down the Grand Canyon, to collecting the rock samples, to preparing the samples for microscopic examination, the whole story is fascinating! Plus explaining when various mountain ranges were created as well, from those created during the Flood (like the Appalachians) to those created after the Flood (like the Rocky Mountains). If you're at all interested in geology, especially Flood geology, this documentary is a must.",True
4,10,Very informative!,proverbs-34773,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIs Genesis History? This well-done and thoughtful documentary answers just that, as it walks through a Biblical perspective of the flood and what happened after the flood and what would that world look like and behave. They explain in great detail the scientific evidence that showcases the geological evidence that supports the flood theory from the fossils, to the mountains, to the unique folds in mountains and various rock formations around the world. The detailed explanation was very helpful and informative. While most critics will simply ignore the evidence and criticize the scientists completing the research I would encourage everyone to look clearly and in an unbiased way Christian and atheist alike.",True
5,10,Exploration into how the World was reshaped,pcsheppard-44637,n/a,16/08/2025,"After viewing this film I walked away amazed. Ait goes through the science of how this world was reshaped after the flood. A great sequel to the first movie. It explains in depth the Biblical view of
how the earth was designed by a intelligent creator, not a process that took millions of years. A must see to answer how to defend your views scientifically.The movie prooves that a Christian's view can be addressed with n a scientific way. It painstakingly takes you through the steps in the science of Geology to prove there was a worldwide flood. It starts where the first movie ended, n the Grand Canyon. With it's massive canyon walls pointing the way to an intelligent designer creating our world in a short (less than millions of years) view of creation.",False
6,n/a,Excellent presentation,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Mountains after the FloodThe definition of the word 'Bigot' is one who has no tolerance for the opinions of others. To not be a Bigot, one must be willing to hear other opinions and evaluate them in an honest and unbiased way.Watching ""The Mountains After the Flood"" was an enlightening experience for me. One must consider that educators have been teaching something completely different for as long as I can remember. That goes back a long way since I am almost 80 years old. I had believed that those who wrote the Bible were inspired, but wrote in a way that could be understood by their readers at that time.I had considered God's 'day' to be figuratively speaking and not literal. With the geological reasoning shown by the examples in ""Mountains"" I can see and understand the Literal meaning of the words in the Bible. It all makes sense to me and has strengthened my faith even more.Now, will the geological studies presented cause the 'unbelievers' to reconsider, or will they show their 'Bigotry' and refuse to accept the solid geological evidence presented in ""Is Genesis History"" and ""The Mountains After the Flood""? I wonder. Let's see what time brings.",False
7,10,I enjoyed it.,oleglankin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this film when it just came out on streaming, and it is the best movie showing how creation science is done in the field. I love how it takes you along as they collect samples of bent rock layers from multiple locations, beautifully animates their hypothesis of how the rocks came about, shows how they turn the samples into microscope slides, and explains exactly what we are seeing on slides, making the viewer the scientist. It presents the studies and explanations of the rocks given by naturalist scientists, and presents their own findings with beautiful and easy to follow explanations of just what happened during and after the flood to produce the mountains and landscapes that we see today. I very much enjoyed it.",True
8,9,Informative and understandable,countitjoy-62891,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film shows how scientific work is done. Working from mental models, researchers notice things in the real world that either seem to fit or clash with the models that have been proposed. Then, they plan ways to use techniques and technologies to rule out parts of the various models in play. The scientists in this film are on the cutting edge of model building from a creationist perspective. The film documents from hypothesis to conclusion, their investigation of folded sedimentary rocks in the Grand Canyon. They set out to discover whether those folds were formed under the kind of conditions in which hard rocks can be bent--slowly, under pressure, which produces metamorphic rock--or whether they were formed while the rock layers were still soft. The evidence shows conclusively that the folds happened while the layers were soft. This rules out some parts of the conventional model for the formation of the rock layers and the uplifts that caused the folding. If the conventional model were correct, the folded regions should show signs of the pressure and heat necessary to fold hardened rock, and they do not. The film shows all this with beautiful scenery and very understandable interviews. Did it leave me in tears or ecstasy? No. It's a documentary, intended to get a clear message out to a lot of people in a bite-size chunk of time. As an armchair scientist and student of creation, I'm grateful to get an up-to-date dose of what's going on the field of creation science. This is inspiring and encouraging for believers who might not know how the evidence is stacking up for the Biblical model of origins.",True
9,10,A true Gem that comes from the Rock,stonelesstemple,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mountains After the Flood is an inspiration to all free thinking people, it is so encouraging to see True Science finally beginning to catch up with the facts, instead of supporting a tired-old Darwinian false narrative. Thank you to the 'Is Genesis History' team for all your hard work, and honesty. This film is truly a gem that comes from the Rock.Movies like this one will inspire a great deal of new knowledge and theories. Discoveries that are just waiting to be uncovered. I have been so discouraged in the past with the false science supporting the tired-old Darwinian false narrative. This movie, and others like it will give us all the encouragement that we need.",False
10,10,Looking for another Perspective on the Flood?,jcasparie,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Biblical recording of the Flood is probably one of the first miracles in the Bible to be refuted by science. One learned scholar once reported that, if all the water held in the Earth's atmosphere were to suddenly rain down, there would, indeed be a flood. But the depth would only be ~1 inch -- barely enough to float a canoe, much less a giant ark. The scientists who produced ""Is Genesis History?"" show, in amazing and convincing detail, how that theory doesn't work with the facts of what the geological record shows.If you'd like to find peace between what your Bible says and what science verifies, WATCH THIS FILM!",False
11,10,Excellent documentary,georgesherrmann,n/a,16/08/2025,"This well-produced documentary is well worth seeing. Truths are hidden in the small details. We need more films like this.In Switzerland, we have geological folds that are far more impressive than those shown in this documentary (for example, the ""Petite Dent de Morcle"" or the ""Ferdenrothorn""), but I can hardly find any research documents that give such clear and precise explanations. We need geological scientists like Dr Andrew Snelling and Dr John Whitemore in Europe.When someone tells you about these folds, most people believe in the paradigm of hundreds of millions of years without having any critical sense. Science needs to be critical, especially forensic science.Thank you for this documentary.",False
12,10,Must Watch Creation Science,djbarna,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a wonderful follow up to the first movie where we get to see the process of how creation science is done. I had been waiting years for this movie to be released after it was announced and it did not disappoint. Creation science is often mocked for not being ""real science"" and this movie does a great job of showing the process that is used and how data is collected. After watching the film it is reassuring to see that creation science is as real as it gets and it is the conventional view that has to overlook real data to support their position. It is amazing to see the power of God in his creation and this movie showcases a group of men truly seeking answers that confirm the bible.",False
13,10,The future of science,garrettpleague-12476,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't make it a habit of trotting out my credentials, but here goes. I have three degrees in biology, including a PhD. I've conducted research at the highest levels of my field. I have published in high-falutin peer-reviewed journals. Go ahead and Google me if you don't want to take my word for it.I say this because what I am about to say may come across as naïve hyperbole, rather than what it really is: a considered, well-informed opinion. This documentary represents not only the future of creation science research, but of scientific research in general. An audacious statement, but I can back it up.In the first film, Is Genesis History?, we were given an overview of the various disciplines of creation science through interviews with leading researchers in these fields. In this sequel, we are provided an intimate, in-depth look at what real ""boots on the ground"" creation research looks like in the field and laboratory.By following the collaborative efforts of several working creation scientists testing a novel flood-inspired hypothesis with far reaching implications, the audience is given a master class on the scientific method in action.You want testable hypotheses based on Biblical historical data validated by innovative creation research, complete with all the proper sample controls and microscopic data you can handle? You've got it. Want to see seasoned geologists think outside the stale, outdated materialistic paradigms holding back the modern scientific establishment from making truly breakthrough discoveries? Check. Want to see powerful confirming evidence that the catastrophic flood model could revolutionize our understanding of earth's history? Done.I know, I know, the haters will still find fault. Let them. Pick up Snelling and Whitmore's scientific papers and dissect away. They are there waiting for you when you finish your scoffing.The fact is, creationists are doing science. They are subjecting their ideas to falsification based on real facts ""out there"" rather than merely pointing to cuddly images of a ""bathtub ark"" in a Precious Moments Bible. Forget all that kitsch. What these scientists are documenting is real and cannot be so easily dismissed.In fact, this film gives us a glimpse into where mature ""science,"" that is, knowledge, is heading after a several-centuries-long adolescent pipe dream of explaining everything around us without recourse to the divine. What fool's errand that has turned out to be.Make no mistake about it: The ""God hypothesis"" is back folks. And we're just getting started. This movie will show you why. It will show you the future.""For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea."" - Habakkuk 2:14.",False
14,10,Evidence for the Biblical Flood - It's Real.,michaelhgray-81758,n/a,16/08/2025,"Real observational science and scientific evidence that supports the actual historicity of Noah's flood. I loved getting to see the folds and samples up close showing how they were formed, seeing the scientists do their specialized work, and the ad-hoc fossil discoveries. This seriously challenges the evolutionary paradigm which all of us are indoctrinated with today, for those who are open minded enough to consider another scientifically substantiated perspective.This documentary follows Creation Scientists as they conduct their scientific research from multiple perspectives showing clear evidence of a global flood, including evidence on a local and intercontinental scale, including a behind the scenes look at some scientific processes that most laymen never get a chance to see in action. Powerful documentary, highly recommend.",False
15,10,Want Proof? Here it is.,elroop,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Grand Canyon is a majestic example of the power and glory of God. It tells us the history of a tremendous underwater event precipitated by cataclysmic seismic activities never before or since occurring on our planet.What happened and why? The Bible relates the word of God describing the great flood that covered the entire earth. Water broke forth from the great deep, and it rained for forty days and nights. The planet was completely covered for an entire year. God did this to obliterate all mankind except for righteous Noah and his family, along with pairs of all the animals to repopulate the earth after the flood.Now we have the history of the flood and aftermath in the rocks. They tell us that the entire Bible is true in what it tells us. The earth was resurfaced by the flood not in millions of years but in likely less than a year. All the layers we see in the Grand Canyon were laid down in a very short period of time - days if not hours in many cases. The enormous bends in the sedimentary rocks could not occur unless the layers were still plastic. If they had hardened over centuries they would have shattered. There is no evidence of metamorphic changes due to heat and pressure.This film is a remarkable story of creation scientists passionately performing their craft and proving the historicity of the Bible with irrefutable proof in stone.",True
16,10,"TL;DR: The rocks cry out, ""The Bible is True!""",jhsrjfdnw,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Is Genesis History? Mountains After the Flood"" is a remarkable work of scientific documentary by filmmaker Thomas Purifoy and hosted by Del Tackett. The film does an amazing job of bringing you into the world of practical science by leading you into the field with geologists Andrew Snelling PhD & John Whitmore PhD, into the lab with geochemist-wizard Ray Strom, and an amazing helicopter segment with Steve Austin PhD. The film presents clear evidence that the rock layers around our world point to a young earth. The data supports the Genesis account so well that an honest assessment of the conclusions will challenge you with the question: Is Genesis History? True history.This film compliments the first ""Is Genesis History?"" film. If you have not seen it, I strongly recommended you watch that one first as it provides the general framework of the creation model upon which the second film builds. The first film shows, from the data, how Noah's Flood provides the best explanation of the world we see around us. And how everything we see in the earth around us and in the geologic column were formed rapidly - not over millions of years!Although you will find many interesting concepts from the creation model in this film, the focus is on one specific scientific study: the huge folded ""hinge"" rock layers that exist in Grand Canyon - how did they form? By the end of the film, you will see how something called OOIDS are a telltale sign of underwater deposition, how all the mud-rock/fossil bearing layers were formed rapidly and were soft together, then raised up, then eroded away on an enormous/global scale, as Grand Canyon bears stunning witness. Come watch ""a hypothesis with extreme explanatory power"" unfold before your eyes. You will be amazed!",False
17,9,A truly groundbreaking documentary.,fitforfaith-ministries,n/a,16/08/2025,"This second film is not just an additional film, it is the most systematic and didactic approach seen so far. It was now a very positive surprise to see Thomas Purifoy and his team taking the viewpoint of the ordinary Christian, and really going to the basics.It was especially helpful that they explained more in detail the crucial bending process and its implications, and not just presented results as so often seen in other documentaries.Especially valuable is chapter 16 and 18 with Ray Strom, and my Spirit rejoiced when seeing this. We now finally see how scientists generate those samples and in great detail how they are able to not disturb the mineralogy of the sample as they go through the cutting and grinding processes, a question which resulted from earlier documentaries but was never answered.Chapter 18 then is groundbreaking in showing the absolute proof why those bended rock formations can not have been composed during an ultra-slow evolution of time. Hallelujah!CONSThey did not explain why it is sufficient to constantly take samples only from accessible layers, meaning samples previously exposed to the weather and so to say scratched from the bare surface. Would it not be helpful to use equipment which is used in many commercial constructions in order to make core drillings? Then they could go at least 300/400/500mm into the rock and we would not only have the microscopic level, but also be able to see the change in structure with our own eyes. Why does every ordinary kitchen countertop (granite) have a much greater visible spectrum than those results they present?ADDITIONAL INSPIRATIONWhile the catastrophic dam burst of the reservoir behind East Kaibab Monocline would explain the final shape of the Gran Canyon, we still have not answered where the material for the sediments came from.It is surprising that American geologists, although they have the Pacific Ring of Fire sitting right beside, have not realized the very probable connection between this and the flood.1. 90+% of the flood waters came obviously not from a hydrological cycle, which -as its name already implies- is a cycle which cannot suddenly multiply its volume of total water contained. Vaporization played a very insignificant part in covering the earth with water. It is abstruse to assume that the majority of flood waters was hanging for ~2200 years somewhere over the clouds (the theory of Whitcomb et al), and we should not add in our minds the possibility that the water came in a supernatural manner through space.2. 90+% of the flood waters came from the abyss, and ordinary springs and fountains spread all over the world would have hardly been sufficient to spontaneously flood the world. Even if all the existing springs would have multiplied its 'output', it would have taken years to cover the highest mountain before the flood (although much lower than today).3. We have enormous fields of sediments in North America, and specifically in the Grand Canyon plain.4. The question is: Is it sheer coincidence to have the Grand Canyon sitting mere 800 km next to the Pacific Ring of Fire? Two of the world's most particular structures next to each other and no flood scientist having noticed this?Should we not strongly assume that underwater fissures along the Pacific Ring of Fire would have been not one of-, but probably the main source for the flood waters spilling out of the mantle of the earth, while simultaneously carrying on its way enormous amounts of other materials which resulted in the highly unusual elevated plains in North America?QUOTE OF THE DOCUMENTARY""... this is just incredible evidence that the Coconino was made underwater. You can't make these kinds of things in a desert. I presented this at a national geology meeting and I had a scientist come up that knew I was a young earth creationist and was skeptical about all the work I had done. And every geologist would look at that and know that those were ooids, except-- - Except if Coconino was in front of the name. - Isn't that interesting? - Yeah. - As soon as it was Coconino-- - So it was just, ""I don't want to see this."" - Yeah, he just would not look at it, would not admit, would not even study them to see if they were ooids or not. And he just said, ""Nope, those can't be ooids. ""Those aren't ooids."" And wanted to drop the subject almost immediately. I pressed him on it a little bit, but he didn't want to go any further on it. - That's what happens when someone is captive in a paradigm. They don't want to see any evidence that's contrary to that paradigm, and that's what was happening to him. - Yeah, that's one of the neat things that we do as creation scientists. We have a different way of looking at things, and so we tend to collect data and look for data that probably other people miss, or probably they might've seen it, but they really don't think very deeply about it and think about the implications.""",False
18,9,Fascinating but Flawed -- A Far Better Format Exists,slocumkent,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are reading reviews for this film, chances are that you have already seen the first film in this series, ""Is Genesis History?"". If you haven't, most reviewers would probably recommend that you go and watch ""Is Genesis History"" first, then return to this film. However, I would offer an alternative (and perhaps life-changing) piece of advice: Don't waste your time watching ""Is Genesis History."" Shocking, I know, but hear me out.Whether you are a Christian looking for further confirmation of the veracity of Scripture, a skeptic seeking solid scientific evidence of the Biblical account of Creation as recorded in Genesis, or someone who wants to figure out how people can be so stupid as to fall for this crazy Creationism nonsense, the original ""Is Genesis History"" film will be of little use to you. The editing is uneven, the conversations are often boring, the location changes are arbitrary, and the overall story is incohesive at best and incoherent at worst. While this sequel (""Mountains After the Flood"") improves greatly in all of those areas, it still falls short of what I believe the producers had in mind.In order for you to understand what went wrong, you need to understand how the production of this film and its predecessor proceeded: Dr. Del Tackett, the narrator of both films, interviewed a large number of scientists and specialists in various locations. These interviews were then condensed down and edited together with transitional landscape shots, some music, and a few animations.As you can probably guess, a film almost entirely composed of interviews and dialogue between two people requires very tight editing in order to keep viewers engaged and help them remember key points. Much like a PowerPoint presentation, documentary-style films need to regularly review what has been covered in order to remind viewers of the most important information. This is often helped with title cards, on-screen subtitles, and regular recaps. However, ""Mountains After the Flood""--as with the original film--was not properly editing for comprehensibility. The content is excellent, but the sections that were selected, and the order in which they are presented, do not flow together smoothly.I must disclose that I watched this film before its general release, and after providing my honest feedback to the production team, I was disappointed to see that no major improvements were made to the overall flow of the film. My disappointment has nothing to do with my ego and everything to do with my concern that this latest installment in the ""Is Genesis History?"" series will not be clear, concise, and engaging enough to reach a wide audience.However, all is not lost. In an ironic twist, the production team behind these two films have unintentionally solved the pacing and editing problems by releasing the original interviews in unedited form. At first glance, it would seem that watching the original interviews in their entirety would be overkill, since the films are simply a ""greatest hits"" editor's cut of the same interviews. But the editing of the films does a great disservice to the original interviews, sacrificing depth and clarity for breadth and speed. Picking the interviews that sound the most interesting, watching them one at a time, and taking time to think about each one before beginning another solves all of the problems that I have with these films.Instead of forcing a narrative onto the scientists, this new format allows the original interviews to speak for themselves, thus making them far more convincing. The scientists themselves are also fascinating, and letting them speak uninterrupted actually improves the logical and emotional impact of their interviews.The interviews from the first film were remarkably numerous and varied, so they have been released in three volumes, based on subject matter:
-Volume 1: Rocks & Fossils (geology, paleontology, atmospheric science)
-Volume 2: Life & Design (biology, genetics)
-Volume 3: Bible & Stars (archaeology, astronomy, history, culture, theology)All together, these three volumes are appropriately called ""Beyond Is Genesis History"", because they provide an opportunity for viewers to delve deeper into the real substance of these interviews.The upcoming fourth volume (Mountains & Microscopes) will continue the series of ""Beyond Is Genesis History"" by releasing uninterrupted interviews with the scientists and specialists featured in the second feature film.If you take my advice and watch some of the excellent content in the ""Beyond Is Genesis History"" series instead of getting confused by the two feature-length movies, you will be rewarded with an unparalleled understanding of just what science truly tells us about our world.Let me be clear: if it weren't for the ""Beyond Is Genesis History"" series, I would not be writing this review. Because these volumes of original interviews exist, and because their episodic format is so much easier to understand and digest than the choppy full-length films, I can confidently say that the ""Is Genesis History"" project is definitely worth your time. Just not the films. Especially not the first one.",False

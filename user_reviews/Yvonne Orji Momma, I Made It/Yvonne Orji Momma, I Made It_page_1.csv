1,8,How can you not laugh?,billsoccer,n/a,15/08/2025,"My wife and I both found her funny - clean humor, based on her experience in an immigrant, very religious family. I've never caught her show so not sure if that's any good, but this special was",False
2,10,Laughing Out Loud,mpmunoz-62990,n/a,15/08/2025,"It takes a lot to make me laugh out loud and Yvonne Orji's HBO special did just that. After watching her show I had to record it and now I rewatch it every time I need some joy in my life. I wish her the very best that life can offer, especially because she honors her mother and father so beautifully......I love her parents too. They bring that warm and fuzzy feeling into your heart, making you smile like a fool.",False
3,10,Pure Happiness,yashuabroomfield,n/a,15/08/2025,"An insightful look at the experiences of a Nigerian american. Even more so, we witness the common interactions that happen across the immigrant community. Her upbringing reflects a much higher standard of success and shes a woman that can look back and laugh at the impossible bar she once met. The joy she holds will be impactful for anyone that watches.",False
4,9,Laughed more than I expected.,ladykiraau,n/a,15/08/2025,"Honestly, didn't expect to find this as funny as I did. Yvonne is very funny in a relatable way. Her jokes are for a specific audience and she uses that to her advantage.She is that funny home girl in every friend group. Her comedy will continue to evolve as long as opportunities continue to present themselves.",False
5,10,Perfectly blended mix,mbakarey-31141,n/a,15/08/2025,Yvonne is a great actress (Funniest Nigerian is America). She depicted this movie in a typical Nigerian and American would understand.,False
6,2,"If you're not Nigerian, or Nigerian-American, you're not going to ""get"" this",asc85,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love Yvonne Orji on ""Insecure""...she's the best thing about the series. So I really wanted to like this special. The problem is that she does her act in Nigeria, so her act is for a Nigerian audience. I am not Nigerian, so her act went right over my head. Why on earth would HBO make a show like this for an American audience? My only theory is that Orji is such a talent, and they want to keep working with her in the future, so they did this for her. But if you're not Nigerian, or Nigerian-American, this is unwatchable.",False
7,10,Hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,guyadiangold,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yvonne Orji is hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!! She and other Nigerians like Gina Yahshere, Luvvie Ajayi, Godfrey, etc., are captivating and injecting excellence, energy, and culture into the entertainment industry which was so lacking!It is beyond time for Black comedians, actors, writers, entertainers, etc., to shine! They just needed the gatekeepers to get out of the way!!!! No more bull about no one being interested in their product.For decades I had to settle for dry, humourless, old white dudes like carson, letterman, leno, and others. Thank goddess they are going extinct!!!Let the good times and fun times finally roll.P. S. I am not Nigerian or Nigerian-American and I got it!!!!!!!!!! It was the so-called humour of carson, letterman, leno, etc., that always went right over my head. Finally this is material I can relate to!!!! Keep up the excellent work my people. Wakanda Forever!!!!",False

1,8,Deniers Gonna Hate This,live-and-let-live,n/a,15/08/2025,"The creative team has met the challenges of this film with nuance and journalistic integrity, depicting its subjects' views accurately while applying a sharp critical lens. BATTLEGROUND respects that people have come to their deeply-held positions on abortion from diverse backgrounds, experiences and beliefs. Viewers from all sides will probably strongly disagree with some of the voices in the film, and that's OK - hearing from people with different points of view is a healthy part of our democracy. However, imposing one's personal beliefs on others' healthcare decisions through gerrymandering, stigma, voter-suppression, misinformation and other methods is not.BATTLEGROUND is fundamentally the story of how a minority of people are manipulating the levers of power to subvert our democracy and advance their agenda against the will of the majority. While the film depicts the clash of abortion and politics in America, it is really about the erosion of our democratic systems and the disintegration of the separation between church and state.The team behind this film are unwilling to accept an America where women's and pregnant people's lives are gambled with for political gain. If people do not understand the motivations and machinations that have created this situation, we will be unable to change it. That means fostering civic engagement at all levels, shifting culture, engaging the next generation with the same vigor as the anti-abortion movement is and exposing the detrimental outcomes when abortion is politicized.As the producer and writer of Bully and the director of Netizens, I have a record of creating films that transcend political affiliations and catalyze measurable change. BATTLEGROUND is a unique opportunity to unleash a national dialogue about the future of American democracy and abortion rights - and inspire audiences to effective and focused action.",False
2,1,Idiocracy of the Left! (Update: Roe Vs Wade Overturned!),jackkern-862-993699,n/a,15/08/2025,"""American democracy and abortion rights"" have Nothing to do with each other, the two are irrelevant in every way. Where is Democracy when Tax Payers are forced to Fund Abortions, the abortion clinics, and the salaries of staffers? There is No Transparency of where our tax dollars are used at Planned Parenthood, there are numerous scandals of tax dollars allocated for PP clinics going to fund Democrat party initiatives.""Justice Alito's majority opinion not only sustained the Mississippi law but also said that Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that affirmed Roe's core holding, should be overruled. The reasoning in Roe ""was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences,"" Justice Alito wrote.

3,1,Biased propaganda,kcitraro,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this to understand both sides. This documentary only highlighted pro life. There was little mention or filming of pro choice. It presented the people in a way to make everyone believe that the majority of America are pro life conservative evangelicals. Are you kidding me? 70% of Americans feel the rights of women to make their choice is their preference. They may or may not choose this for themselves, but the right should still be there. Unbelievable that they did not show any of that information. Nothing about the impact of losing that choice on the lives of the woman. How many now die by suicide or mangled self abortion now? What impact did the overturn of Roe V Wade have on everyone? Should women now die from a life threatening pregnancy? Fact. It's happening. Women are dying now. That kills the unborn and the mom. That leaves her other children likely parent less. Now orphaned. How much money is now spent on welfare recipients due to keeping an unwanted pregnancy? How many abused children of psychologically imbalanced women? How many unwanted rape children will there be? What impact does this have on the man who got this woman pregnant? Just a BS propaganda documentary of one side. Pro life. I starred the writer and director so I can make sure I never watch anything from her again.",False
4,2,its infuriating...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"When watching documentaries about some of the most important issues in life, the choice between to live or let die for the benefit of the human kind. I do have my standpoint, but want claim that to you, but the way this documentary kisses and hugs the prolife side is just a propaganda rally, cause it 5 % proabortion and the rest of the mike belongs to the holy wrath upon thy who kill movement., its a truly a develish battle for sure, waving the 2000 year old rights written in the scriptures against the human rights law of modern times, the doom is that you go to hell anyway, and every argument is waived away using the book...this is unfortunately pure propaganda, and if youre proabortion and pro women rights without the threat of dantes visions of hell you may be set out. Im just devastated by the divide in our largest allie nation, its barely an alien nation to some extent, a no recomment from the grumpy old man to this screaming holy rallying for life...",False

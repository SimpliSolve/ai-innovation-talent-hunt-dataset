1,9,Mesmerizing,beemtoaustin,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's not often that I rate a film this highly, but Contemplations deserves to be seen, more accurately, experienced, not only for its mesmerizingly spectacular, wholly immersive visuals -- a tapestry unlike anything you may have seen before, running parallel and in complete harmony to this documentary's expert interviews and opinions -- but also to be applauded for its sensitive and balanced approach to what is perhaps one of civilizations least talked about but rapidly evolving movements, the psychedelic underground, here focused on Australia's psychedelic experience, but with implications worldwide. A cautionary tale, masterfully displayed.",False
2,9,Aussie psychedelic doco that is for the whole world.,francsoisfouche,n/a,15/08/2025,"This captivating documentary excels in its genre, presenting superb production values, breathtaking visuals, and interviews filled with sincerity. It shares profound insights gleaned from years of exploration in psychedelic substances. It's a must-watch and offers more depth than Michael Pollan's documentary.Centered on the Australian psychedelic movement, though its themes are universally applicable, this film reveals that the director's vast experience with these substances significantly impacts the subjects' lives, often positively. This documentary is definitely worth your time. I got a lot of value out of it.",False
3,10,A well crafted and unique masterpiece,heatseekerdale,n/a,15/08/2025,"A very iconic and unique Australian documentary featuring a cross section of some of the mainplayers in the Australian Psychedelic underground.This is a both a journey into the psyche and an introduction to the felt experience of psychedelics. Refreshingly, it is more focused on the spiritual, transpersonal, paradigm shattering, esoteric aspects of psychedelics - rather than the current mainstream rhetoric around the trauma healing aspects of these uncanny plant medicines.Add to this a well crafted, visual feast of special effects and articulate commentary and you have a unique and special documentary - well worth a watch.Well done Julian Palmer and team.",False
4,10,Balanced and profound insights - really enjoyed it,jonathontse,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thank you, Julian and the team for putting this well-thought-through documentary on the journey of a psychedelic experience and what impactful benefits it can potentially have for someone's overall wellbeing!The diversity of the people on the screen shared some very troubling and touching histories and in my view, anything that can improve (and sometimes drastically) someone's time on this earth, the better!Sometimes it's just not possible to see the forest through the trees and
that can cause a lot of (and somewhat chronic) negative emotions and moods and lead to poorer health outcomes.Highly recommended!",False
5,10,Very fascinating way for portraying psychedelic experiences into film,heidileopardskin,n/a,15/08/2025,"It can be merely impossible to imagine or describe one's psychedelic experience to others whom may have never tired or fully ventured in the psychedelic arena.""Contemplations: on the psychedelic experience"" gives you an excellent way to visually comprehend a psychedelic adventure, whether it may be encountering and/or becoming a god or unveiling the secrets to the universe, to describing one's distressing decent into madness.Julian Palmer has a way of conveying his film into layman's terms so that anyone can understand and appreciate. The illustrations married seemingly well together with the stories and experiences being described.I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",False
6,10,Contemplations celebrates the uplifting stories of those transformed by psychedelic experiences,indiewrap,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerContemplations: On the Psychedelic Experience is a 2022 feature length documentary written by Rak Razam and directed by Julian Palmer. The documentary dives deep into how psychedelics are gradually becoming part of the mainstream in New Zealand and how individuals from all walks of life are finding their lives changed for the better through these substances.Combining face to face interviews with CGI, animation and real life nature imagery, the documentary is an interesting beast. Masses around the world have been wary of psychedelics for quite some time but recently, the narrative is gradually shifting as these substances have been found to be extremely beneficial for a lot of conditions such as PTSD and trauma. With public opinion well under transformation, Palmer's documentary comes at just the right time to get the conversation rolling. Psychedelics are here to stay and Palmer's feature shows just how important they have been in changing lives across the globe.The best thing about the documentary is how earnest it is. Palmer manages to focus on a large and diverse group of people, from all walks of life, who found their lives improved massively as a result of these substances. Contrary to popular opinion, the people focused on here are not stoners and deadbeats. Rather, they represent the pinnacle in their respective careers; from computer engineers to medical professionals, it seems everyone can improve themselves using psychedelics. Finding spiritual connections to their souls, the various individuals focused here feel visibly stress free and in touch with themselves. The documentary is so effective that it will convince even the most ardent of critics to take another look at how these substances are changing lives for the better.Psychedelics have always been about leaving the material weight behind and embracing the spiritual. Upon taking psychedelics, people have reported losing their egos, their day to day stresses and severing connections to all of their possessions that have essentially owned their lives uptill now. The documentary makes an effective case for this as person after person explains how his or her life is now a lot more grounded and carefree than it used to be. Palmer knows what to highlight and in making sure the audience knows what the specific benefits of these substances are, he is effectively convincing the masses to take the leap.Julian Palmer, the director, approaches and structures the documentary in a way that even those who have been on the line about psychedelics for now, will not be turned away. The narrative pacing is perfect and this is important for a documentary that is almost two hours long. Palmer makes the subject interesting, ensuring that the audience is hooked from the start. The deep voice over in the beginning sets the tone for the rest of the feature and as user after user shares his and her life changing experience, one cannot help but find his point of view changed.Any feature dealing with psychedelics should be a visual delight and Contemplations manages to hit a home run in this regard. The film features a barrage of insane visual candy that accurately depicts both the highs and the journey of an individual taking these recreational drugs. It is often said such a trip is unlike any other, assaulting the senses of the user in a way that few things manage to do so. Some people have reported to have an out of body experience whilst others have found themselves in a kaleidoscopic wormhole that goes eternally deeper. Contemplations manages to visualise all of these experiences and more and the insane visual candy depicted is perfectly complemented by a soundtrack that deepens these visuals.This audio visual assault on the senses is extremely effective and the audience find themselves sucked into a psychedelic experience of their own as the feature progresses. From all perspectives, Contemplations is a home run. Julian Palmer's documentary is insightful, fascinating and a sight to behold. From its heavy voice over to its fantastic visuals, Contemplations is an accomplishment that needs to be seen. The film is philosophical, metaphoric and hopeful all rolled into one and soars way beyond we expected it to. It will convince the naysayers to take notice of this new avenue in human exploration whilst providing the masses the push they need in order to experiment with these substances for the very first time.",True
7,10,This Was A Surprising Documentary,CeeJaySupernornalizedDotCom,n/a,15/08/2025,"Julian the director, has found so many great angles on the psychedelic experience directly from experiencers which to my mind is the best source rather than static stuffy scientific studies.The alchemy of direct questioning drawing out an understanding that is personal to the speaker which then engages the viewer is clearly engaging.The topics explored are done so with a sensitivity that only a long time journeyman in these spaces could do. I really enjoyed how the interviewees were treated and it is apparent that many are long time friends of the director with something to share that is important and timely.High credits to all that worked on this. It is inspirational and yet offers cautionary tales that reign in the unwary. Very well done!",False
8,10,A deep dive,evsie-35239,n/a,15/08/2025,"In this documentary film Juilan Palmer has put together quite a fascinating dive Into the world of psychedelic medicines and their wondererous teachings , this film is beautifully presented and will leave you pondering on many facets of why we are here and experience. Jump into the world of the unseen and mavel at this masterpiece.

9,10,Fantastic,samrichards-86843,n/a,15/08/2025,"Contemplations: On the psychedelic experience is a fantastic dive into the psychedelic underground. It's a warts and all documentary that details lots of people's first hand experiences with psychedelics. It includes some cautionary tales which are important to listen to
and also documents lots of profound, life changing experiences which are very common in the psychedelic world. I'd strongly recommend it to anyone who's in anyway interested in exploring or deepening their understanding of the potential therapeutic risks and benefits of psychedelics. It gives a truly unique insight into people's worlds and experiences which I haven't seen before in any other psychedelic documentaries. I've found value in others that I've watched. But they haven't gone into anywhere near as much detail when documenting people's first hand experiences. This one definitely does and is definitely worth a watch for anyone who's interested in the subject matter.",False
10,10,Excellent Documentary,mwcurran,n/a,15/08/2025,"Austrialian produced documentary on the wonders and benefits of the psychedelic experience on those who have tried them. A psychedelic experience (known colloquially as a trip) is a temporary altered state of consciousness induced by the consumption of a psychedelic substance (most commonly LSD, mescaline, psilocybin mushrooms, or DMT). This film is recommended by anyone who wishes to expand their knowledge of these substances and to learn more about their many healing qualities. For anyone who has ever wondered about these mind altering substances this is a film well worth watching. Detailed accounts of personal experiences give insight and knowledge of these little-understood drugs.",False
11,10,Essential viewing for anyone interested in the psychedelic experience,donbenito_cm,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've just only started to dabble in the plant medicines and compounds mentioned in this film. The people interviewed in the film come from all walks of life and give an open and unbiased view on their experiences.Julian Palmer is much more than an interviewer, he has lived the life of a facilitator, plant tea brewer and individual experimenter for the last twenty plus years. This film covers the frightening, the heavenly and everything in between. There are cautionary tales, and first hand accounts of meeting gods. These are brought to life by the excellent animations, this is an impressive feat all by itself because just articulating the experience is hard enough, let alone reproducing it for others to understand.If you are interested in the effects of ayahuasca, magic mushrooms or LSD, then this a great place to start. There really isn't another documentary like it!",False
12,10,Somehow managed to articulate the sublime,daniel_mclean,n/a,15/08/2025,"Definitely worth a watch if you are interested in the true nature of the psychedelic experience.Julian is a pioneer, ahead of his time, and this shows in this piece of work. Whilst the mainstream is talking about medicalisation, without understanding the spiritual nature of the experience, the well articulated journeys described shed light on topics like entities, 'bad trips', oneness with God to name a few.If anyone is qualified to document the underground in Australia, it is Julian. The visuals are quite amazing in and of themselves.Somehow this doco manages to articulate the sublime, and I highly recommend it.",False
13,10,👌,bauerianabiz,n/a,15/08/2025,"This doco is truly inspiring. Listening to the stories of many people and their connections to plants and psychedelics helps form a culture and a guide to those seeking/ experiencing other realms.From watching this doco, I have found company in past experiences that have been isolated from human connection.I have gained a sense of direction as to how I can enhance connection to other lifeforms from listening to others. I am grateful to be able to listen to these stories in this context while enjoying the epic animations that somehow seem to transcend the usual barriers of communicating other worldly experiences.🤙",False
14,10,One of the most Authentic psychedelic documentaries ever made,koohyar-11587,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can relate to Julian Palmers work deeply since I experienced synthetic mind-altering medicines in the early 90th during the psychedelic renaissance in Germany and continuing in Americas with sacred plant-based medicines.This documentary is empowering, liberating, full of honest wisdoms and beautiful images.The subject is much bigger than experiencing psychedelic medicine. It contains a potential cure for a world which is heading to self-destruction and self-alienation. More and more people are finding self-healing true mind-altering medicines. This documentary will help them to understand the potential of integration of their experiences.Juian Palmer is a pioneer of our time.",False
15,10,Worth your attention,bnwhitwell,n/a,15/08/2025,"Contemplations is a profound journey into the world of psychedelics through intimate, firsthand accounts.Thoughtful and considered questioning by the Director draws out unique perspectives from each of the participants, creating not just personal understanding but a shared experience for the audience and I enjoyed being able to relate.Julian's deep knowledge and genuine rapport with his subjects shines through, showcasing a nuanced exploration of diverse topics.

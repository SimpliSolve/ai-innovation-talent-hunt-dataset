1,7,A Raw Look at the Human Cost of the Death Penalty,pinkmanboy,n/a,15/08/2025,"""I Am Ready, Warden"", directed by Smriti Mundhra, is a short documentary that focuses on the days leading up to and following the execution of John Henry Ramirez in Texas. While it fits into an overused genre, the film succeeds by humanizing the discussion through characters who carry the scars of this reality. The portrayal of Aaron Castro, the victim's son, is especially striking. By centering the narrative on Castro during the execution, the film provides a painful and honest perspective. His mix of skepticism when hearing Ramirez speak of redemption and the weight of his sadness after the execution show the emotional complexity of the death penalty's impact. This moment serves as the moral heart of the film, a powerful reminder that regardless of one's views on justice, lives continue to be torn apart.The film also stands out for including a diverse range of characters, offering contrasting perspectives on the justice system. In addition to Castro, we meet figures such as Ramirez's charismatic godmother and a prosecutor who now opposes the death penalty. This multifaceted approach gives the audience a broader understanding of the layers involved in the issue of capital punishment. However, the narrative avoids romanticizing Ramirez or attempting to justify his actions with superficial arguments about his potential redemption. The film's message is clear: opposition to the death penalty shouldn't depend on the character or ""goodness"" of the condemned. This direct stance is one of the film's strongest points.On the downside, the choice to include a sentimental-heavy soundtrack weakens the natural power of the scenes. Moments already filled with emotion don't need melancholic piano music to drive home the impact. The gravity of the subject matter is enough on its own, and the music feels intrusive, almost underestimating the audience's ability to absorb what is being shown. Even so, ""I Am Ready, Warden"" offers a valuable contribution to the debate, not only by reinforcing the cruel and outdated nature of the death penalty but also by reminding us that at its core, every execution is just another tragedy that perpetuates cycles of pain and violence.",False
2,6,"I am Ready, Warden",CinemaSerf,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nobody has been executed here in the UK since 1948 so it's quite difficult to get my head around a society that not only still condones state killings but, more disgustingly from my perspective, has a television programme called ""Execution Watch"". This short documentary follows the last week of John Henry Ramirez who has spent years on death row for a killing he openly admitted. Now he has found Christ and the new DA has requested that the death penalty be commuted to life without possibility of parole. It's not because he's a Christian that he has asked for this, but more because he has his own moral objections to this whole process of punishment. This new approach has it's supporters and detractors and we hear from both - including the murdered man's family. It's presented clumsily and as if it were an hastily cobbled together news feature - complete with repeated soundbites and lingering photography that made it look more like a staged drama than a serious look at how people deal with something quite this visceral when it touches their lives. There's always going to be debate about this ultimate penalty, but I am afraid this does little to inform that discussion and is really quite disappointing.",False
3,6,"""I don't know that execution is the right thing to do."" - District Attorney Mark Gonzalez",classicsoncall,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThough it may be its intent, I'm not sure if this film short will change minds on either side of the death penalty controversy. Convicted murderer John Henry Ramirez expresses his responsibility and regret for the stabbing of a victim twenty-nine times when he was an irresponsible teenager some fourteen years earlier. As he sits on death row, he recognizes the horror and pain he caused for members of the Castro family, and somewhat to his credit, does not plead for mercy or break down in tears in a manner to elicit sympathy from the viewer. He was prepared to go to his death in dignity for the suffering he caused, leaving a recorded message for the son of the man he killed expressing his regret. A conflicted district attorney weighs in with an attempt to withdraw Ramirez's execution without success, and as the viewer, one is left with his or her own views which may or not be altered by the sad facts of this case.This work is a 2025 Oscar nominee for Best Documentary Short Film. I was fortunate to attend a screening of all five nominees in the category at The Paramount Theater in Middletown, New York. I don't know how I would have ever come across them otherwise, and here they were all in one place.",True
4,7,Actions = Consequences,imdb-696-3176,n/a,15/08/2025,Not sure how Texas feels about electing a DA that opposes capital punishment. I understand that some people are capable of change but I'm hopeful that people might think prior to committing murder when watching this type of documentary. John Henry Ramirez showed empathy and regret. We will never know how genuine or true it was. He seemed to find Jesus and right his life as much as is possible sitting on death row. It seemed that his death did nothing positive for the victims son of the world we live in. I'm sure if a loved one is taken too early all of us would have mixed feeling and emotions on how that assailant should be treated.,False
5,5,Decent but Overused story.....,661jda,n/a,15/08/2025,"I went in-knowing what this was about. I came out NOT being moved. How can a person who stabs another person 29 times -19 of them mortal wounds-then elude the law for 4 years and then say ""I believe in Jesus and I'm sorry""??? Not Sorry - No compassion. By commuting his sentence, all you do is prolong his misery in a captive environment, and put stress on the penal system for care and stresses the victims family. Stress on the penal system for health care, lodging, food, security: Inmates receive better care than homeless people in this country. I could think of a million things to argue, but this, like a number of other similar docs and features, doesn't sway opinions: It's a polarized topic.",False

1,8,very much enjoyed,BABSBunny24,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have enjoyed Fortune's works since I first saw her in 2020, and I look forward to many years more. Something that strikes me about her stand-up is that she puts on a grown-up show without being vulgar. She manages to be tasteful and down to earth at the same time. Dont get me wrong, i love me some vulgar, but it is kind of a breath of fresh air nonetheless.She seems like she'd be an awesome person to hang out with, not just because she's funny but because she makes people around her feel good. And thats the kind of vibe her comedy has to me. I dont want to spoil any of the jokes so i'll leave it at that.",False
2,9,Couldn't stop laughing,wmnielsen,n/a,15/08/2025,"A really classic standup. Her stories about her vacation in the Maldives, struggling through the Hardee's Drive Thru, High School and the school choir are so funny. I tried to catch my breath, but she started talking about buying a house and the laughs kept coming. She talks a lot about her relationship with her mother that everyone can identify with. And her mother makes an appearance during the closing credits and reinforces all the earlier stories. Very funny show.",False

1,8,Grim and necessary,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe war in Gaza is a terrible thing. All wars are bad, but the objectives of the Isaraelis seem to be clear: to make Gaza uninhabitable for its Palestinian population. This documentary focuses on medics who have come under attack. The story is unsurprisingly grim, although the programme doesn't quite make the case that the hospital system has been specifically targetted amid the general destruction. What is does show us is how ""Hamas made us do it"" provides an all purpose excuse for the Israeli army. The programme was banned from the BBC and it's hard to see why: while obviously it is providing us with a Palestinian point of view, the razing of Gaza and the death of thousands of its people is an incontravertible fact. What it isn't is a tale that will leave you with a happy heart.",True
2,10,A devastating but vital testament to bravery amid inhumanity.,gulahmed,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gaza Doctors Under Attack is a harrowing and essential documentary that exposes the brutal realities faced by medical workers in Gaza amid relentless conflict. Through raw footage and firsthand accounts, the film highlights the courage of doctors and nurses who risk their lives to save others while their hospitals are bombed and supplies dwindle.The documentary doesn't shy away from graphic imagery, forcing viewers to confront the human cost of war. Interviews with traumatized medical personnel reveal their resilience and despair as they operate without anesthesia, treat children with horrific injuries, and mourn colleagues killed in airstrikes. The film also condemns the systemic targeting of healthcare facilities, raising urgent ethical and legal questions.While emotionally overwhelming, the documentary is a powerful call to action, demanding accountability for war crimes and solidarity with Gaza's besieged healthcare heroes. A must-watch for those seeking unfiltered truth, though not for the faint of heart.",False
3,n/a,Documenting the Indocumentable,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gaza: Doctors Under Attack is a documentary in the truest sense of the word - not just an account, but a record. It focuses on medical professionals working under conditions few of us can imagine, where the idea of neutrality is tested not in theory, but under fire.The film avoids sensationalism. It doesn't try to moralize or dramatize - it simply observes. In doing so, it offers a rare kind of insight: not into policy or politics, but into consequence.Some may debate context or framing, but the footage speaks clearly. These are not actors, nor rehearsed testimonies. These are people doing their jobs while everything collapses around them.That the film was not broadcast by all major outlets is noted in the coverage surrounding it. But perhaps that absence makes the documentary more vital, not less.Watch it not to pick a side, but to understand what it means when infrastructure fails, and those meant to preserve life are left unprotected.It's not comfortable viewing - and that's precisely why it matters.",False

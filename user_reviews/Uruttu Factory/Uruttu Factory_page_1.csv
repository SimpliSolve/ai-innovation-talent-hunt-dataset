1,9,A Dangerous Deception: When Influencers Lost Track,navingenius,n/a,16/08/2025,"In an era where social media influencers wield immense power over their followers, their actions can have far-reaching consequences. A recent incident involving a popular influencer has highlighted the dangers of prioritizing personal crush over ethical considerations.The influencer in question, known for his engaging content in a specific genre, has been accused of inadvertently promoting a scam. However, the circumstances surrounding this incident are particularly troubling. It appears that the influencer's personal feelings for a family connected to the scammers have clouded his judgment, leading him to disregard the potential harm he could cause to his audience. What can we expect after all? The influencer even kicked his own brother out of the joint company.While the influencer may have been unaware of the scam's true nature, his support for it has inadvertently legitimized it in the eyes of his followers. Many of his fans, trusting his judgment and expertise, may have been tempted to invest in the fraudulent scheme. This is a stark reminder of the responsibility that influencers bear to their audience.It is imperative that influencers prioritize the well-being of their followers over personal connections. By promoting scams, even unintentionally, they are putting their audience at risk of financial loss and emotional distress. It is crucial for influencers to conduct thorough research and due diligence before endorsing any product or opportunity.This incident serves as a cautionary tale for all influencers. It highlights the importance of maintaining ethical standards and considering the potential consequences of their actions. By prioritizing personal relationships over the welfare of their audience, influencers risk eroding their credibility and damaging their reputation.",False

6,10,RIP Ego,aswaothers,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an A2D fan, the movie was an eye-opening experience.It revealed how misleading an influencer can be.This is a clear-cut demonstration of confirmation bias.A man who considers himself good at R&D is proven wrong, and his ego gets smashed.The movie shows that no matter what you do, there's always someone better than you.With nonstop twists, the director takes the audience on a rollercoaster ride from start to finish.I hope the hero understands that he was biased and chooses to do better with his life.Instead of chasing subscribers and posting nonsense, he might go back to posting tech videos like he used to.He wanted to support Tailor Akka, but that backfired on him. I'm sure the hero won't try to justify his actions after this, as he's been checkmated now.",False
7,10,"Urrutu Factory' Unveils the Truth Behind Online Deceit!""",jjawahar-56788,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Urrutu Factory"" is a gripping expos√© that dives into the world of online deceit. Directed by Sid, the film focuses on Sid's mission to uncover the truth about Nandhakumar, the owner of the YouTube channel A2D. Armed with thorough research and compelling evidence, Sid reveals how Nandhakumar misleads his viewers into believing in a scam orchestrated by Dhayalu Designs.The direction and cinematography are outstanding, particularly the twist at the interval block, which left me on the edge of my seat, and the climax was nothing short of ultimate. The film carries a crucial moral: don't blindly believe everything you find online. Instead, do your own research and be cautious about whom you support.While I enjoyed everything about the movie, the sound could have been a bit louder. Despite this minor flaw, I wholeheartedly recommend ""Urrutu Factory"" to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and entertaining watch.",False

12,10,Narcissistic and Egoistic Nandha got exposed,amazonaffiliatesin,n/a,16/08/2025,"1. Champion of Anti-Promotions... While Selling Pirated KeysNandha has publicly condemned paid promotions on YouTube, but at the same time, he has been involved in the illegal sale of pirated software keys. This contradiction is not only unethical but also unlawful. It exposes a significant gap between his public stance and his actual practices.2. Narcissist Extraordinaire: Sabotaging Others' SuccessNandha exhibits clear narcissistic behavior, as he consistently undermines others' achievements. His inability to accept that someone else might excel or succeed reveals his fragile ego. He seeks to elevate himself by dragging others down, including members of his own family.3. Brotherly Love? More Like Career DestructionNandha's toxic personality has even extended to his own brother, whose career he has deliberately sabotaged. This goes beyond typical sibling rivalry and highlights a disturbing pattern of jealousy and spite, where his brother's success was seen as a threat to his own self-worth.4. Misinformation Maestro: Manipulating People with Half-Baked ""Research""Nandha has built a following by manipulating people through poorly researched and misleading information. His half-baked research not only misguides his audience but also encourages them to support illegal businesses, including the sale of unauthorized medicines. This unethical practice puts the health and safety of others at risk.5. The Real Scammer, Playing the VictimNandha has a clear political bias and frequently spreads negative rhetoric about North Indians, painting them all as scammers. Ironically, he himself has been exposed as a scammer, making his accusations not only hypocritical but also a reflection of his own unethical behavior.",False

17,10,Must watch movie for every Soldier,sharanajay-28822,n/a,16/08/2025,"A narcissistic person is someone who always thinks highly of themselves, craves constant praise, and doesn't care much about others' feelings. They tend to control situations to their advantage and often try to silence or belittle those who don't agree with them. Now, it's clear who is a bad influence - someone who doesn't mind stepping on others to stay in the spotlight. This behavior can be seen in how A2D, a well-known reviewer in the tech and design community, has been blindly supporting Dayalu Design without paying attention to any criticism or negative feedback.One recent event makes it clear how far A2D is willing to go to protect his interests. Sid, another popular reviewer, who is known for giving honest and unbiased reviews, pointed out several flaws in Dayalu Design's recent projects. Sid didn't hold back and explained how some designs were faulty and even questioned the ethical practices of the company. Many people in the community supported Sid's points, as his arguments were based on facts and examples that couldn't be easily ignored.However, instead of addressing these concerns, A2D decided to block Sid's content on his YouTube channel, even marking Sid's work as a SCAM. This wasn't just an ordinary disagreement - A2D was trying to shut down a valid opinion that didn't align with his own. By doing this, A2D showed that he wasn't interested in having an honest conversation or even considering the possibility that Dayalu Design could have made mistakes. His main goal was to defend his own position and continue supporting Dayalu Design, no matter the cost.This action by A2D reveals a lot about his personality. Just like any narcissistic person, A2D seemed to want complete control over the situation. Instead of allowing people to hear both sides of the story and form their own opinions, he manipulated his platform to silence any voices that didn't support his narrative. Blocking Sid was a way to ensure that the audience would continue to trust him and Dayalu Design without ever hearing about the issues Sid raised.By labeling BM's content as a scam, A2D wasn't just protecting Dayalu Design - he was also damaging Sid's reputation. It's a classic tactic that narcissists use: discredit the opposition so that no one believes them. This, in turn, discourages others in the community from speaking up or sharing their true thoughts for fear of facing the same treatment. It's like creating an echo chamber where only one voice is heard, and that's a dangerous thing in any industry, especially in the world of reviews and design.People like A2D, who use their influence to protect their own interests rather than provide honest feedback, can cause long-lasting damage to their community. By refusing to engage with constructive criticism, A2D not only hurts the integrity of the design community but also encourages mediocrity. Dayalu Design, feeling shielded from negative feedback, has no incentive to improve or learn from their mistakes. Meanwhile, those like Sid, who offer honest critiques, get sidelined and labeled unfairly.This behavior also reflects the problem with certain influencers today. When personal or financial interests come into play, they sometimes ignore their responsibility to provide honest opinions to their audience. A2D's blind support of Dayalu Design is a clear example of this. He seems more interested in maintaining his relationship with Dayalu Design than in helping his audience make informed decisions. This not only affects his own credibility but also weakens the trust that viewers have in reviewers and influencers.In the end, A2D's decision to block Sid and blindly support Dayalu Design has hurt his reputation. He is no longer seen as an impartial reviewer but rather as someone who uses his platform to serve his own needs. His actions have also created a toxic environment where honest feedback is stifled, and only praise is allowed. For the tech and design community to thrive, it's essential to have open discussions and allow room for both positive and negative feedback. Unfortunately, A2D has shown that he's more interested in protecting his image than in fostering such a space.This incident highlights how damaging it can be when influencers like A2D fail to stay objective and transparent. By trying to silence Sid and protect Dayalu Design, A2D has shown that his reviews can't be trusted. The real issue here isn't Sid's critique - it's A2D's refusal to allow open conversations and his blind support of a company that may not deserve it. For those who follow these influencers, it's important to remember that not everything they promote is perfect, and sometimes, you need to seek out different perspectives to get the full picture.",False

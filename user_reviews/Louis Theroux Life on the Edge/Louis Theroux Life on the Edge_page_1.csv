1,8,"Context for the recent USA ""happenings"" - an insight into a splintered society.",Higgy52,n/a,16/08/2025,"This provides an interesting overview of how the USA got to where it is now - very timely, even though the timing was accidental. Yes, I have seen a lot of these previously, but this series provides a snapshot of a vastly different society than what we might expect from a wealthy and ""advanced"" society. If you have an inclination, you may like to read Fantasyland by Kurt Andersen, or search out some of the in-depth reviews.",False

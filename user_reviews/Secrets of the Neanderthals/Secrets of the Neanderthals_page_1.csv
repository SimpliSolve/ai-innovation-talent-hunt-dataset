1,6,Generates more questions,jwdwqbxb,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI thought this documentary will give me more evidences and details about Neanderthals, something based on scientific studies and research, DNA analysis for example!It is full of emotional stories, a lot of assumptions and theories. The whole documentary depends on one or two locations where the scientists found remains of the Neanderthals, then started asking questions about their life and religion more than giving clear explanations or answers!I cannot say it was a waste of my time, but it did not explain anything new, just new assumptions.Netflix has much better documentary contents to watch comparing to this one.",True
2,7,Not Enough Information,LaughingTigerIMDb,n/a,15/08/2025,"I feel like this was an opportunity to show off more hair and makeup skills based on what we know Neanderthals to look like. We keep getting reminded that they were not a stupid species and they had thoughts and feelings, and the hair/makeup/costume team stepped it up to show that much.I had read that upon meeting homo sapiens, that that the Neanderthals were actually a bit more advanced than they were, and had already established a way of life that involved jewellery, for example. Neanderthals were creative, and found ways to adorn themselves, and showed humans how to emulate what they knew.Instead, this documentary shows a rather polished-looking group of homo sapiens coming into contact with Neanderthals, who look like they've all had baths and their clothes laundered before arriving. What this is suggesting in this documentary is that humans may have been a bit more refined. But is this true? This contradicts what other archaeologists have found.""We all carry Neanderthal DNA"" is also not true. This is true for those of European descent, but not African, Asian, or Native Americans.I did enjoy the re-enactments from the actors who were dressed up to show what a typical Neanderthal may have looked like and to see what they were doing. But I really wished there was more of that. They hinted that they had language, and yet not a peep could be heard from the actors. It's as if they were told not to use dialogue together. Maybe the mouth prosthetics made it impossible? I don't know. But it would have been nice to see and hear them making sounds in conversation, rather than motioning to each other, capturing the quintessential stereotype of the caveman/meat head type.I also enjoyed listening to Sir Patrick Stewart. It gave the documentary some warmth that added to the idea that the Neanderthal people were compassionate and emotional themselves. As for the information? I felt like so much was being held back, just to enhance the information we already know about with computer work and costuming.",False
3,7,Very good introduction to modern thinking about Neanderthals,robertasmith,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some of the comments from reviewers are strange in that the reviewers seem disappointed there are assumptions. Of course there are. That's archaeology. I am a post graduate archaeologist and making assumptions is part of the process of interpretation. The modern evidence is showing Solecki's assumptions were partly incorrect and I have no doubt that in 50 years the science will have advanced so that new interpretations and assumptions are made. However, this wonderful documentary is a fantastic introduction to the world of the Neanderthals and what we currently know about them. For instance, it's only in the last 20 years we have established they ate plants. Kudos to the international team that have made these wonderful discoveries and long might they prosper.",False
4,7,Lovely perspective,unaantovic,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is exactly what you can expect from a documentary on Neanderthals. I see too many reviews saying it should be more precise and less speculative because ""science is not speculative."" Do you know how hard it is to even determine the sex of old skeletons, let alone anything else? Archaeologists, in most cases, can't say anything with 100% certainty. Of course, it's speculative. Until you know something with complete assurance, you don't truly know.With all this said, I'm very satisfied with this documentary. I heard about it from someone who called it a ""series,"" and I was excited to watch something longer than this, but nonetheless, it's totally worth watching. The scenery is absolutely amazing.",False
5,7,Unveiling Our Mysterious Cousins,haomaa,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're curious about Neanderthals, BBC Studio's new documentary ""Secrets of the Neanderthals"" offers a compelling look at these enigmatic human ancestors. Narrated by the ever-intriguing Sir Patrick Stewart, the doc delves into recent discoveries that challenge traditional views of Neanderthals.The focus on the Shanidar Cave excavation in Iraqi Kurdistan is particularly captivating. Here, we see archaeologists unearth new evidence that sheds light on Neanderthal behavior and rituals. The documentary also explores intriguing sites in France and Croatia, adding depth to the Neanderthal story.While some sections might feel like a refresher for those already familiar with Neanderthals, the fresh research and engaging presentation make it worthwhile. However, the film could have benefited from a bit more on the reasons for their eventual extinction.Overall, ""Secrets of the Neanderthals"" is a solid documentary that will leave you wanting to know more about our closest extinct relatives. It's perfect for a casual watch and a good fit for anyone interested in human evolution and prehistory. (7 out of 10)",False
6,7,Not So Secret Neanderthals Doc That Unveils a Complex Past,visualsbyalan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Netflix's ""Secrets of the Neanderthals"" isn't exactly breaking new ground in documentary filmmaking. The familiar troupe of talking heads and sweeping nature shots is present. Yet, there's a certain charm to this BBC Studios production, fueled by a genuine fascination with our extinct cousins.The documentary hinges on a recent excavation at Shanidar Cave in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We follow a team of archaeologists, led by the enthusiastic Professor Graeme Barker, as they unearth a remarkably well-preserved Neanderthal skeleton - the first of its kind in the region for over 25 years. This discovery forms the narrative spine, allowing the exploration of Neanderthal life through the lens of this individual.What elevates ""Secrets of the Neanderthals"" is its focus on debunking outdated stereotypes. Neanderthals are no longer depicted as knuckle-dragging brutes. The film effectively highlights their complex tool use, elaborate burial rituals, and potential capacity for symbolic thought. This revised image is bolstered by impressive CGI reconstructions that breathe life into these ancient humans.However, the documentary falters slightly in its pacing. The Shanidar Cave excavation, while significant, can feel drawn-out at times. Additionally, some scientific explanations could have benefited from a touch more simplification for a broader audience.Overall, ""Secrets of the Neanderthals"" is a solid and informative documentary. It serves as a timely reminder that our understanding of human prehistory is constantly evolving. While not a groundbreaking masterpiece, it's an engaging watch for anyone curious about our enigmatic ancestors.",False
7,n/a,Dismal Failure,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I do not understand the point of this documentary.You learn nothing about Neanderthals.You DO learn way more than you want about the people studying them.The weird thing is they don't even bother to ask the questions most viewers might have about the subject matter, much less answer them. Questions like how did they live? What happened to them?Apparently the filmmakers thought Neanderthals liked to roll around in the mud.... I started laughing about it.There are some interesting sites they visit (eg beautiful caves) but it is too little too late. The scenery plays second to the scientists roaming around in it.I seriously don't know why they bothered to even make this. It is boring and uninteresting.The best part was that Sir Patrick Stewart narrated it.",False
8,7,Science and speculation,evanjones-10395,n/a,15/08/2025,"This one hour and 20 minute long documentary mixes paleoanthropology with speculation, as do most programs of this type.I very much enjoyed the depictions of Neanderthal caves, habitats and tool construction . But as soon as a scientist says ""maybe..."" I tune out the rest of their thoughts, because it's going to be speculation with no basis in scientific fact, merely extrapolations leading to one potential explanation (among many) for their findings. That is not science. Since the program wanted to present speculations about Neanderthal behavior, it would've been much better served to offer several alternate explanations for each speculative conclusion.Sir Patrick Stewart is far too old to be the narrator for this program. His voice is shot, and it really shows. I was kind of embarrassed for him.",False
9,10,"My opinion as a history lover, please watch",foxylady-81968,n/a,15/08/2025,"After watching this documentary now, my first thought was to come here and leave a comment. I really felt like I had to. The fact that this is only rated as 6.5 is absolutely absurd in my opinion. Documentaries like this one is not necessarily something you rate at ""movie quality"" ratings, which I did find good here as well, but more of the knowledge that you gain. I finished watching this documentary with actual tears in my eyes, wanting to get a DNA test just to know if I have the honor of having some Neanderthal DNA as well. This is a phenomenal piece of our history which has incredible value.I have an enormous amount of appreciation for all of the researchers who made this idea, this part of human history, their life's mission, and are making these unbelievable discoveries. Thank you all.I recommend this documentary to any history lover who is truly interested in the human history. Maybe you'll find something new.We are not that different as we sometimes think 😊",False
10,7,Feeling of the time,David Elroy,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's not heavy with facts, but that's to be expected since hard evidence of Neanderthals is scanty. (Depending how you count, only about a dozen complete skeletons have ever been unearthed.)It tries hard to give Neanderthals the benefit of the doubt, seeing them as peaceful and intelligent as much as the evidence will allow. We know they had tools and clothes, and we know they gave some attention to burial of the dead. But we have no definite evidence of art (carvings, paintings, necklaces).What I like best is the re-enactments, including the images of landscapes and coasts. Sir Patrick Stewart sounds tired in his narration, but the gentleness in his voice conjures a simpler time.Nothing groundbreaking in this movie, but a good respectful treatment of a fascinating topic.",False
11,4,Questionable Assumptions as Fact,charlottestreet-28346,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Secrets of A Neanderthal"" presents itself as an intriguing exploration into the lives of our ancient relatives, the Neanderthals. However, while the documentary offers fascinating insights, it falls short in its tendency to present assumptions as facts.Throughout the film, viewers are bombarded with speculative assertions about Neanderthal behavior, culture, and interactions. While these hypotheses are certainly thought-provoking, the documentary often fails to distinguish between established evidence and mere conjecture.One of the most glaring issues is the danger of presenting theories as concrete truths, especially when discussing events that occurred over 50,000 years ago. The limitations of archaeological evidence and the inherent biases in interpretation should caution against such definitive claims. Yet, ""Secrets of A Neanderthal"" seems to disregard this, leading to a potentially misleading and overconfident portrayal of the Neanderthals and their world.Viewers would be wise to approach the film with a critical eye, recognizing that many of its assertions are, in fact, speculative in nature.",False
12,8,The Neanderthals are still here.,bmasteller,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this because I'm very interested in the history of the world. The Neanderthal did not just disappear. I wanted to watch to see what happened to them because I did a DNA test and I have 231 variants that trace back to Neanderthal. So, they are not gone. I would love to see the cave and look and touch the bones of my ancestors. It was surreal to watch and think am I related to any of them? It did scare me that they were cannibalizing each other. They must have been starving. I think the ones who traveled out of Africa mated with the Homo Sapiens they met and their DNA is in humans now.",True
13,6,Assuming.,Ahmad_Yaseen97,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary was quite enjoyable, but it leaned more toward the human side of the discovery than the scientific aspect. While this was fine, it left me wanting more depth and detail on the Neanderthals' fascinating world. The human element made it relatable, yet it could have used a bit more focus on the scientific intricacies that could have taken the documentary to a higher level.The topic is incredibly engaging, especially when delving into who came before us and exploring how Neanderthals lived, interacted, and eventually disappeared. Although the documentary touched on many interesting points, expanding the scientific explanations would have added more layers to the narrative, making the experience even more rewarding.Overall, it's a solid documentary, but there is untapped potential to elevate the storytelling by integrating more scientific evidence and theories. Nonetheless, it's a great watch for those intrigued by our ancient predecessors.""Assuming""",False
14,4,Neanderthals accomplishments,loki-95273,n/a,15/08/2025,"Soooo...neanderthals and denovisians roamed the earth for 300,000 years before home sapiens yet the upwards of 90% of modern invention started right after the middle ages in Europe in the last 600 years. Welp, thank god for Europeans! I would love for thos show to have delved into how the neanderthals lived a bit more.Seems like i need to meet some rediculois requirements of required character counting quoto mechanism to meet a satisfactory number of required characters that is far too wordy for the review of a dull and exigent netflix mockumentary, so here i am filling a void of time and space and paragraph.",False
15,7,Secrets of the Neanderthals,snoducky,n/a,15/08/2025,"A decent documentary.Although I'd like to see some more depth of information in this documentary it does give you the basic knowledge behind Neanderthals. The documentary is very brief and surface level, it lacks any deeper understanding which is a shame if you want to delve into the history behind them. It does use some nice visual representations but sort of forgets about the detail, the documentary is more mainstream and fitted to society as a whole rather than the people who really are interested in this topic. There are lots of other documentaries about Neanderthals which are heaps better. Overall no bad.",False
16,7,A fascinating and interesting doc about distant relatives...,mdw0526,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary, by the same producers as the recent ""Einstein and the Bomb"", is a really interesting watch, and I actually learned a bunch of new stuff. As was discussed in the show, we usually consider Neanderthals to be a slur, thinking of them as nothing more than brutish cavemen, but new research shows they were much more complex than originally thought. There's great footage of Shanidar Cave in Kurdistan and the Bruniquel Cave in France, and the facial reconstructions they did based on recovered skeletons was remarkable. I've always found paleontology interesting and am endlessly fascinated by the evolution of mankind, so I definitely recommend giving this doc a watch if you're feeling a little education-minded.",False
17,9,Nuggets of progress in archeology,HlenSki,n/a,15/08/2025,"I took this documentary as an update to previous understanding. Science including archeology is always some degree like solving a puzzle with just a fraction of the pieces. When you find new pieces, some old pieces are invalid and yoi have to re-arrange.I find the connections made to religious practices quite fable, but understood that spirituality as a word perhaps explains some things better. I guess humans and the like have a tendency to symbolic acts, especially in regards to perished loved ones.This was a very interesting update on the idea of our own ancestry. It also had reflections of humans often lazily putting themselves above others. This trait could well be one of the reasons we prevailed, but it's a trait that's starting to turn against all humanity.So, the documentary does not go into that much detail scientifically but there are plenty of other documentaries that do.",False
18,2,Full of unbased speculations,danamitkov,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are too many assumptions they regard as conclusions. Not every circle is evidence for religion, and not every corpse in a cave is sacred burial. There could be so many other explanations for things, but it feels the show just chooses the most poetic ones as truth. Someone was found dead in a natural pose in front of a rock? Ahh he must have been put there as a religious ceremony and this is probably the beginning of religion.If they have better reasons to why the jumped si high for these conclusions, they didn't explain them.Also, i found the reenactments cringey, and the pacing is off. There are some parts that have modern world updates that are really longer than they should be. No, i don't need a 5 minutes update on the history of iraq just so they can tell me that that archeologist didn't come back to the site...",False
19,2,Not what I expected,martyam,n/a,15/08/2025,"As an archaeology student I was very disappointed with this film. Like former documentaries I expected to see a film with Neanderthals living, and a voice over. There was no discussion on the various theories about what happened to the Neanderthals, very little in their way of life, and very little footage of them actually living. The point of a historic documentary is to get a feel of that creature's way of life. This film was mostly about the archaeologists' techniques and how they felt, and very little about the actual Neanderthals. I've seen much more informative about Neanderthal on YouTube.",False
20,2,Slomo Neanderthals...,DaveModer,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was awful. You learnt almost nothing about Neanderthals, but heard about the feelings and premonitions of the scientists... I was fast forwarding nonstop. It is a documentary not an action flick, why do they have to use all these slomo shots. The music is also overkill, what you see and hear is not matching. This one hour gave so little information. If you want to see proper documentaries about Neanderthals just go to YouTube. I highly recommend the ""The Last Neanderthal"" from BBC Earth. This is about the very last Neanderthals who lived in the Gibraltar caves. You actually get to know how they lived and eventually... perished. Yes, it was the climate change, because they had nothing to eat, the last of them died of severe malnutrition. What a huge secret, isn't it?!",False
21,5,Didn't enjoy it.,wolfghostninja,n/a,15/08/2025,"Patrick Stewart is the narrator of this light ""documentary"", and the posh received pronunciation accent starts to drone quickly. British accents have oversaturated the documentary landscape. I can't abide listening to them for several hours anymore.I've read that the Scottish accent is the most desirable in terms of call centres, and that is due to its pleasing lilt.Anyway, aside from the tedious voiceover, there's really nothing much here, and it seems to be a hair and makeup exhibit more than an educational journey into an interesting topic.And now I shall keep writing until the required character limit is met. Thanks for reading.",False
22,3,History Bias and War Footage and in Neanderthal Documentary,rachel_bullen,n/a,15/08/2025,"While diving into 'Secrets of the Neanderthals', I found myself confronted with a jarring and utterly irrelevant 2-3 minutes of intense war footage from Iraq. The inclusion of such content not only shocked and disgusted me, but raised critical questions about the editorial integrity behind such decisions.An American voice declares ""this is not the United States against Iraq, this is Iraq against the world"". This represents a biased view of history from a Western perspective rather than presenting an objective historical account.The sudden bombardment of war imagery felt manipulative and sensationalist, veering the narrative off course and into the realm of propaganda.Rather than enriching our understanding of Neanderthal life, it seemed aimed at inciting emotional reactions.Is this an attempt to rewrite and influence historical narratives or justify past actions? There surely must be transparency and integrity in media storytelling, as sadly, I perceive this segment of an otherwise intriguing documentary as propaganda.",False
23,3,"It had potential, but I learned nothing new!",IdriesH,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTo be honest, they really drew me in with the scenery, the Iraqi man, the music, and the vibrant HDR colors. However, I watched this documentary to learn more about the Neanderthals, but I came away with more questions than answers. I literally learned nothing new. It felt like the filmmakers were more focused on the emotions of the archaeologists and laboratory workers rather than on educating the audience. Their hypotheses were poorly explained, and there was a significant lack of scientific depth in this documentary. It seemed more intent on conveying emotions and feelings rather than providing substantial information, especially towards the end when they showcased the sculpture. Frankly, if I wanted to see a sculpture and people's reactions to it, I wouldn't have needed to watch this. Also, the title doesn't align with what is actually presented about the Neanderthals. I wouldn't recommend this documentary to anyone looking for knowledge or hoping to learn something about Neanderthals. If you enjoy emotional content, perhaps this might be for you...",True
24,2,It is a lost one hour of my life!,mansourkhalil-88456,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is replete with assumptions, lacking any concrete evidence to substantiate the religious claims it explores. Initially, it raises an intriguing question about why certain Neanderthals vanished, but disappointingly, this point gets lost and remains unanswered by the conclusion. The presentation hints at a profound exploration but ultimately fails to deliver any robust scientific insights, serving instead a series of misleading assertions.On a positive note, the production quality is outstanding. The 3D designs are particularly impressive, reflecting commendable skill and creativity from the design team. The artistic rendition of the last face depicted in the documentary stands out as a notable achievement.Overall, while the aesthetic aspects of the documentary are praiseworthy, it falls short in its factual content, underscoring a significant gap in what it promises versus what it delivers. This piece exemplifies the disconnect between archaeological interpretations and the actual historical pathways, leaving viewers with more questions than answers.",False
25,1,WTF I couldnt hear anything of worth,skyyyyywalker,n/a,15/08/2025,As the Others told I can't hear anything More then asumptioms. Its the Same like the Last documentarys on netflix about human history. They say things conclude from these things to something only to hold up a narrative Even if they used some real historics and anthropologists. They just say hey Look could it be and continue the narrative as it would be real science I'm a Little disappointed that so much Money flows to fiction believes/ critical' thinking and you have the Same as history channel. Or as I mantioned its Like. Ancient apocalypse Form the psych Graham Hancock which is completlie debunked by milo From miniminutemen. I Need to say if you want to sleep Well its slow Pace enough.Everybody who Wants this to watch for scientific reasons dont Go to Netflix to have a real overviewI Hoped it would be ok but its just fiction maybe thats the thing of Netflix Now for documentarys.,False

1,6,Harry: The Interview,studioAT,n/a,15/08/2025,"As Chandler Bing once said - ""can open, worms everywhere"".Prince Harry doesn't just open the can he drops a word bomb right over the Royal Family and then sees what will happen next.Is he misguided? Is he just speaking the facts from his side of things? Either way ITV seemed to think he was worth listening to, bumping their ratings hit 'Midsummer Murders' to make way for it at the very last minute.The book will sell copies by the million, Prince Harry hopefully will have the good grace to let the words soak in a bit before launching the next round.He may want to come to a resolution, but right now that doesn't look likely.",False
2,7,"Harry, what are you doing?",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Journalist Tom Bradby interviews the most talked about man on The Planet right now, Prince Harry.The Simple truth, an explosive book, and the content is toe curling, he's speaking about many, many different subjects, including drugs and losing his virginity, a surprise let's say.We've had the Netflix series, we've got the book, and now the interviews. I will give credit to Tom Bradby, for asking the right questions, he didn't hold back, he wasn't afraid to ask Harry all manner of questions.Some of it was interesting, some of it made me want to hide behind my hands, and I know full well what a lot of people will say after this goes out. Some of it is absurd, schoolyard dramas, almost unpalatable.I'm not sure Harry will ever reconcile with his family after this, every bridge seems to have been burned, and judging by this, I don't think he's done with the matches yet, he says he wants a relationship with his family, and yet he reveals such information as this, I am flabbergasted by the revelations.Harry's account of his brother, I found that genuinely sad, all families, especially siblings have problems, that nonsense with the beards....they really are a family from another world.Some of it was quite moving, that moment where he spoke about the death of his mum, that truly was upsetting, and you really do get a vision of a man haunted.Unlike the Netflix series, this wasn't boring, Harry said the saddest thing was his family, for me the saddest thing is that he takes absolutely no responsibility for anything at all, every single thing he talks about, is someone else's fault.What would you share if William was watching this? I won't share that.....no, but you are happy to share everything else.Seriously sad. 7/10.",False
3,1,Watching water boil is more exciting..,racheljonz,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sorry, not on my top 10 list. I really struggled to watch this interview to the end, it was so boring. It is basically a regurgitation of any interview Harry has done. I don't think the interview was hard hitting at all. No punches pulled by the interviewer regarding Harry's hatred of the press, while Harry and Meghan continuously do interviews and draw attention to themselves. The interviewer obviously got a list of questions ahead of time that were approved.Spare yourselves and skip watching this interview. It's pretty hard to listen to someone who has never really wanted for much to complain about everything. After watching this interview, I will definitely spare myself from Spare.",False
4,7,"Good interview, misguided motivations",anthonyjlangford,n/a,15/08/2025,"I for one have not been a fan of the couple's continuous circus over the past few years.Here's a simple equation to consider.Is it the entire royal family? Is it all Meghan's family?Or is it one person? The other being too close to be subjective.I did watch this all the way through and I also feel more compassion for Harry now than before. I truly believe he thinks he's doing the right thing. He also has his wife in his ear and no doubt surrounded by a bunch of self serving sycophants who are giving him bad advice, or at least not challenging him or them in any way.Having said that, he's very clear on his path and one can hardly blame him given the English press' horrendous reputation (like most media to be fair), plus what happened with his poor mother. He's imbued with persecution complex fueled by Meghan, who also has her own persecution paranoias. If he thinks taking them on in multiple lawsuits is going to be good for him and the world, then he's wrong. For people who are already so overwhelming sensitive when it comes to others and public perception then lawsuits and public battles will be detrimental to their own mental wellbeing. Time will tell.I do feel for the guy but airing your dirty laundry in this way, continuously, is not the way to bring reconciliation with your family. If he thinks this will help, he's sadly deluded. He may have irretrievably damaged all relationships with his family.They will be unable to respond to this in any way. It's bad enough already. And there's really no recourse for them other than to simply keep quiet. They must be fuming and who could blame them.So far, it's all been one way.In all these type of situations, you simply have to look at the numbers. Is it the whole world against you or is it one person, or couple? A couple is as good as one person as they always share the same views. Harry's trying to shield his family as any good man does but the damage was really done way back when he first began dating her. He was too close to see the red flags that others certainly did.It was a thorough and decent interview. It's just sad to see a good person destroy his life.'The road to hell is paved with good intentions.'",False
5,1,Painful to watch.,plan99,n/a,15/08/2025,"I struggled to watch this all the way to the end as it was toe curling to watch Harry seemingly convinced that the world revolves around him and his wife, news flash for him, it doesn't. It was just as bad as expected, as he seems to be unaware of the wise saying, when in a hole stop digging. The race card is played a lot, for the millionth time it seems, as it suits (ho ho) them to do so. When I first saw Meghan on TV with Harry a few years ago I remained unaware that she was bi-racial only becoming aware when some told me that she was. Harry and his overbearing wife are experts at making world salads as very little of what they say actually makes any sense. I look forward to King Charles stripping them both of their titles. The book ""Finding Freedom"", borrowed from someone, drew them in a very bad light, as has this film, and I have no doubt that his book ""Spare"" will make them look even worse. I am half way through ""Spare"", borrowed from someone, and Harry has done himself no favours. About a third of the way through it I had to take a break from it and I read Audie Murphy's autobiography ""To Hell and Back"" about his service in WWII. Audie was a real man and the most decorated American soldier of WWII at the age of just 19. Audie mentions none of his medals in his book. Harry is just a silly wee spoiled whiny boy by comparison.",False
6,9,Fight through your prejudices and confirmation bias and watch this.,subaroo,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am surprised at the number of people who have developed a toxic attitude to Harry & Meghan to the point they refuse to watch their Netflix doco series, and probably this interview (and boycott his forthcoming book), based on tabloid sensationalism and confirmation bias via social media.Indicative of the times - and human nature - I guess.I suspect there would probably be a subconscious element of fear of not wanting to hear something that might cause them to change their mind by listening directly to the main protagonists.Ostriches.Those who rate this interview poorly probably belong to that mindset as it is hard to fault someone who has risked so much for his wife and children - and his own mental well-being - and wears his heart on his sleeve in this expos√©. Those unmoved by such a story would have to have hearts of stone.Even the naysayers should fight through their prejudices and confirmation bias and watch this with an open mind. It might just change your opinion of Harry and Meghan ... and indeed, others in the Royal family - the latter, not so much in a good way.",False
7,7,Royal Interviews: Destined to Destroy,mike_olley,n/a,15/08/2025,"I know of not a single in depth interview, by a major Royal, that the Royal comes out well, after it's broadcast. I watched the Prince Andrew one, as I did both Diane, and the Prince Charles interviews. All great insights, and highly entertaining. Problem is the ""devil will cite scripture for his own purposes"". And they will, they of course being the media - all shapes and sizes.So Harry is candid, a little naive and certainly a little precious, but he is a bright able fellow. This interview, is if viewed, from a neutral posture, is entertaining, with one or two awkward moments. Yet, of course, I'm afraid Harry runs the risk of being seen as a pious, privileged, pissy, ginger whinger.Who couldn't wish Harry, Megan and the kids, well (maybe not - 25 families in Afghanistan...) ? The test of this programme, however, will be determined by the global media. It's provides a massive resource for them to paint this family, as they will. The pendulum at the time of broadcast is not in the families favour. But of course pendulums swing ...Good watch, and good luck Harry and family....",False
8,10,"Historic, groundbreaking interview",AmorLucis,n/a,15/08/2025,"I applaud Harry for shining a light on the dark dynamics that contribute to generational trauma in so many families. His savvy refusal to accept the assumptions of the loaded questions fired at him by the press is impressive and inspiring to watch. The amount of press and pundits shaming him for whistleblowing just shows how dysfunctional our default cultural ideas are about family dynamics. Good for Harry for speaking up and speaking out. I think this interview is very brave and will help many others to speak out about their experiences of normalized bullying and abuse within their own families. I agree that the silence of the royal family in responding to Harry's transparency speaks volumes. Healing cannot begin without accountability. I hope the royal family steps up. Thank you, Harry. You are a prince in name and in deed.",False
9,10,So happy for Harry,artpspdesign,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm so happy for Harry.. finally he can express himself... finally he's free and above all finally he's happy... I've been waiting for this since his mum died.Soldier Harry stood up and saved the lives of his wife and son. That's wonderful. I was very worried in 2019...I was afraid that he would sacrifice Meghan and their baby for this family and this country like all the other men in his family did. He pleasantly surprised me and we all jumped for joy when he decided to leave.Seeing all he accomplished in my lifetime is wonderful...too bad no one, no one in this country (which is now an ally of the Taliban) helped Diana back then. Also disturbing to learn that the firm and the government told him not to look further into the circumstances of Diana's death.",False

1,10,"An honest, raw and poetic documentary about one of the best Spanish singers & poets",antoniatejedabarros,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fernando León de Aranoa (El buen patrón, Loving Pablo, A Perfect Day, Amador, Princesas, Los lunes al sol, Barrio Familia) has succeed again in creating a wonderful documentary (watch his stunning documentary ""Buenas noches Ouma"", Invisibles). Joaquín Sabina is, I would say, the Spanish Leonard Cohen: he's a poet as much as a musician. Sintiéndolo mucho is honest, raw and poetic, and shows us Sabina without his bowler hat (Sabina says: ""Tengo un problema con el tipo del bombín que se sube al escenario; por eso no me he puesto bombín hoy"" (""I have a problem with the guy who wears the bowler hat and goes on stage; that's why today I'm not wearing one""), and laughs. I'm afraid that one has to know the Spanish culture in order to properly enjoy this film. I personally missed a bit more of his personal life (for instance, his two daughters don't appear in the documentary), but, overall, it's a very beautiful documentary (10-15 years on the making), sincere and genuine. The new song (Sintiéndolo mucho) is both delightful and sad, and reflects, as well as the documentary, on the musical, poetic and human trajectory of Sabina. Bravo, Fernando. 10/10.",False
2,4,Anecdotic documentary,gades_noctem,n/a,16/08/2025,"Joaquín Sabina is one of the greatest Spanish musicians, and his lyrics have a complexity and beauty that are hard to describe without hear them and think deeply about their meaning. However, this documentary looks like a raw production, with many intrascendent moments and Joaquin speaking about different topics without any order (sometimes without any coherence).I suppose that if you are a hard die fan, you can enjoy it feeling that you are there with the artists, his girlfriend and his mates. But it doesn't show anything relevant, don't explain anything. It is like a long and a bit tedious interview with many images from the last years. I wanted to learn more things about Joaquín, but the documentary don't helps you to do it in a meaningful way.",False

1,7,Good but very repetitive,laurie1580-594-442360,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very good series but very, very repetitive. This you can only assume is a time filling option by the producers. It's also very American, the assumption that after every ad break you have to be minutely reminded of all that went on before. The episode I watched tonight about the murder of a Sikh man was no exception, the same photograph of the burned out car in which he was killed was shown about 8 times during the programme. How is it I can watch something like 24 hours in police custody and not have constant recaps of what I was told 5 minutes before? It's infuriating and detracts massively from the programme. I think the series is produced by CBS Reality which I'm assuming is American and therefore we have to suffer this terrible format.
That said it's good to see how the detectives work and crack each new case.",False
2,6,Interesting to follow the Police work.,KhunKai,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is very interesting to watch how the police detectives do their investigation, and with who they cooperate with.Also like to see the participation by the news people how they experienced the cases, and hoe they themselves worked with the cases in the news papers.However, it is very evident these episodes were also shown on regular tv shows, with plenty of commercial breaks. When put together in a streamed series the episodes becomes extremely repetitive, so we hear the same over and over again.But that is not the most annoying. That is Donna Youngs - Criminal Psychologist, whom talk to the camera in an extremely patronizing and arrogant way, as she is would talk to children. She alone basically destroy the entire experience of this so potentially very interesting show.One minor thing is the fact the otherwise good narrator has big problems pronounce non Anglo names. That is disappointing when it comes to his quality.But the show is still worth watching if you just fast forward passed the ""shrink"" talking about stuff we already knew.",False
3,3,The music ruins it!,aprilfromolalla,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like informative, intelligent criminal investigations. This series would have been interesting to watch but for the absurd soundtrack LOUDLY overlaid, drowning out the dialogue. The only time I didn't object to this annoying feature was when the criminal psychologist Donna Youngs was spouting her ""intellectually superior"" opinions as if she's explaining to an audience of children. I've seen her in shows before and she's consistently nauseating.Too bad the people that make these shows don't actually watch them.",False

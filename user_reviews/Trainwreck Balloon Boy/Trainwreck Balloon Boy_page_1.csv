1,6,Still dont believe the family,wesperkins,n/a,15/08/2025,"The episode isnt bad, but the first half is told from the family point of view, as if it was real. The dad is not likeable and the kids are only marginally better. I remember this but forgot the Larry King Live interview part. It was not as good as other episodes, but if you are too young to remember Ballon Boy or never heard of it, it is an interesting watch. I remember thinking it was a hoax at the time and after watching this, I still do. Hard to believe they are still going with their story, and they do try and sell it as it was real, but more likely it was all a set up for attention. I enjoyed the trip down memory lane, but they didn't convince me it was real.",False
2,6,Are you not entertained???,ciara_dale,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yes, yes, Richard we were entertained. However, everyone knows you lied and that the whole family was in on it. Think its about time to give up the ghost. Kind of crazy how this one little stunt affected the way the entire family acts. There's a certain greasiness about all the kids now, sort of slimy attitudes you can't really trust due to this ingrained behavior brought about by this story their father told them they had to always stick to no matter what. They all sort of have that Wolfpack vibe now too, arrested development type thing. No surprise at the end that they are live in this gated compound now, afraid of the world. Hopefully that pardon makes them all less paranoid. I will give props to the wife though. That man found a woman that will stick with him through all of his crazy antics. Got to appreciate that I guess, he's found himself a real one. Also thanks to Netflix for not dragging this one out too long.",False
3,6,I still think it was a hoax,stephaniequarmby,n/a,15/08/2025,"My rating is based on the fact that while well produced, the father is an awful individual and difficult to watch. I also found this not quite up to the same calibre as other trainwreck instalments so I'm a bit disappointed, poop cruise is a tough act to follow.I'm not sure if the family thought doing this show would change public opinion of them. The father is thoroughly unlikeable, and if he wasn't 'acting' then his so-called genuine reaction ('I was PISSED') and behaviour towards his wife is abusive and extremely worrying. He certainly appears as a narcissist, a liar and a bully and this doco leaves me believing nothing that comes from his mouth. Mayumi blink twice if you need help.",False
4,n/a,Keeping the kid's life status is disgusting,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerEven if you believe up front this all to be true and happened the way it is presented it's still pretty horrible.A kid gets trapped in a homemade balloon and floats for a while until it comes down only for him not to be there and instead in the attic the whole time.Story over - except there's another 30 minutes left. Why?They kept Falcon off camera until he appears in the timeline of the story where he is somehow able to fully recount exactly what happened when he was six years old. The interviewees were probably told to not talk about him in a present-tense to keep him being alive a mystery which is so messed up I couldn't keep going after that. Vile tactic on the filmmakers part but maybe not as vile as the parents themselves for staging this in the first place. Which if that is the case why give them this platform? That's exactly what they wanted.Something tells me there will be another documentary made about this family one day with a far more darker connotation.,True
5,7,Bizarrely entertaining.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Richard Heene alerts the authorities that his son, Falcon, has climbed into a homemade UFO balloon. The giant silver, helium-filled structure flies off at a pace; it becomes a major news story. The balloon is tracked by the authorities, officials, and seemingly most of America.This was such a bizarrely entertaining documentary, one of those where you almost watch in horror, but not for the reasons you may be thinking. Someone please explain to me why and how so many people were taken in by the story.There was a lot of fascinating footage, including the initial lift off scene.I thought Richard Heene was wonderfully charismatic and entertaining, but there was no way on earth he didn't know that Falcon was not in the balloon.Richard definitely had a desire to grab a little bit of fame; why else would he have appeared on Wife Swap? His behavior on that show was designed to get himself noticed, no other reason. That moment where Falcon told the cameras that it was all a game was so revealing.Did anyone truly think that Falcon was in that balloon? Genuinely? Let's be honest, this could only have happened in America.7/10.",False
6,7,We did it for the show,natashamasters,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary literally shows the world how innocent children can be even when they've been told to lie!Firstly I will say though I really enjoyed it. I knew nothing of the story of balloon boy before I watched it and found the way that it was put together was a nice easy watch. I believe that the bad ratings are coming into play because the family are clearly lying, but rating as a show I enjoyed it.The family clearly are liars and just trying to get on a get rich quick scheme. From the child admitting ""we did it for the show"" to the mother saying ""my English wasn't as good then"" it's really apparently they are lying. The police said the mother had a degree in English and had further been to an English speaking collage. I cannot believe for a moment the word fraud was not mentioned anywhere. I went back and watched the wife swap they were part of too to get more of a picture of the family and the dad is clearly unstable, I'm not surprised they mentioned removing the children from them!One of the main things I found annoying though was the oldest son's swearing in his interviews. I'm not saying it's bad to swear just the way he casually through swears out in gaps not really needed was unnecessarily. You'd have thought he could have kept a clean mouth with the little speaking parts he had.All in all I stand by my rating, it was a good show and I enjoyed watching it. It's just a shame that now it's all been said and done that they still can't admit the truth.",True
7,3,Shame on Netflix for Giving them More Spotlight,hidavegeorge,n/a,15/08/2025,"This family is disgusting. They are such terrible actors. Why would Netflix give them more publicity? From the start of this ""documentary"" really just ""Crazy Family Storytime"" the family is just putting on a show for the cameras. Every time they're on camera it's like watching a bad TikTok skit. Falcon himself is completely without credibility. He has gone on record saying the whole episode is foggy to him and that most of what he remembers is from videos. Yet he recounts minute-by-minute details of the day in this program. Give me a break. This show is beneath Netflix. This family should have never been heard from again.",False
8,7,Better Trainwreck Doc,maybeahottake,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter coming from Poop Cruise, this is a definite step up.A local story that became a worldwide sensation for a day when a homemade aircraft flew into the sky...with their child believed to be inside. I personally remember when this story happened, but I believe it was a perfect story to make a documentary on (unlike poop cruise) for people who don't know what happened.Most of this documentary actually speaks on things that happened *after* the event and what the family is up to. It gives many different opinions and sides into what people think actually happened.Great docu and I'm loving that the 'trainwreck' series is keeping it short and sweet. What bothers me is the people reviewing this. The documentary offers all the differing opinions so you as a viewer can form your own opinion on the incident and the true motive of this family. But your opinion shouldn't affect the rating of your review....",True
9,4,This family still wont own up,MajBlade2,n/a,15/08/2025,"I lived in Colorado when this happened as like many others that day I watched it all play out on TV news. When it all came out that the kid wasnt in there, people were not happy. And it quickly turned on the family when no one quiet believed the story. This guy was what would now be called a social media wannabe. That whole family was bred and raised to further his attempt to be TV famous. From the moment this guy got caught he did nothing but obfuscate, throw his kids under the bus, and outright lie. It was like if baby Jessica had been a hoax. People in Colorado immediately turned on him and the family. He got his 15 minutes but now one in that area will ever forgive this family for the hoax.",False
10,7,12 Monkeys,hkgxukw,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are two times in my life thus far in which I lost trust in the news media. I won't name the second but this fiasco was the first.I remember while the nonsense was live on TV and proclaiming "" there's no boy in that balloon!"". All i could think about was the movie 12 Monkeys with the boy in the well and all the while he was in the barn.The fact law enforcement did not search the attic is mind blowing at best. The parents stated the kid was always hiding yet nobody bothered to look in the attic or any other known crawl spaces? The fact the parents had no idea the kid had a hiding spot in the attic is also pitiful.I am not convinced the parents made it up but I'm not convinced they didn't either. This is a family that lives life on their terms but doubt they would go to this extreme to become famous. How could they even have imagined a hoax like that would garner national attention and ultimately prosecution. Good on the family for moving on with their life and not allowing this ridiculous moment to define who they are.Shame on the ""news"" media!",False
11,2,Creepy,HilaryC-01,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Train Wreck series is pretty cheesy. The documentaries and sensationalistic and tacky. This one, Balloon Boy, goes above and beyond.The father is clearly manic and is basically a clone of Cody from Sister Wives in temperament and ego. He is screaming for attention 24/7, even whwn he already has it.The mother is clueless in every way a person can be and is completely controlled by the father. I don't know what happened to her that makes her that subservient, but it's pathetic to witness.The sons are misogynistic tools, programmed by daddy. Beware.Watching the documentary, and especially the father, made my skin crawl.",False
12,8,There's a good reason to give the family more attention,vandalz,n/a,15/08/2025,"Why give this obviously lying family more media attention? To remind everyone they are a pack of liars who played the world in an attempt for fame. Instead of achieving fame, they became infamous. Sixteen years later, the world had mostly forgotten the events of Oct 15, 2009, the family could have (should have) refused to take part in the Trainwreck documentary, and remained mostly anonymous again.No, Heene family, we don't believe your story. We don't believe the parents, and we don't believe the sons who continue to tell an obvious lie. There were two times the family spoke truth: When the youngest son admitted on Larry King that it was a hoax, and when the father entered a guilty plea.The lousy acting during the launch, the parent's reactions to the youngest son's admission on tv that it was a hoax, the father's cringy polygraph footage, it all adds up to one inescapable truth: the parents were hoping for a reality tv show, and exploited their children in the process. People will forgive if an apology is sincere, but this pack of liars seems pretty adverse to telling the truth. So, if they aren't going to admit and apologize to the nation, a reminder of their many lies is the next best thing.",False
13,7,"Poor family, great inventors",UltraNeptuneCat,n/a,15/08/2025,"What would be the point of faking this whole thing. They literally moved away, almost had kids mom deported for a petty 'crime'. Sure people can lie but this was not dramatized they freaked out thinking their brother and kid is going to die way up in the sky.This is a shorter documentry just a movie long. But It has everything you need to know. The neighbors knew they were just clevor family having fun, they wanted to make a cool sauscer as anyone would want to try and imagine when they that old.These are just the ideal family of wanting to explore things then the media dissapproved of risks and every one wanted to take away that sparkle.",False
14,3,This was the worst doc of the trainwreck series,eric_kohli,n/a,15/08/2025,"The interviews with the family throughout were not useful in any way. They talked about this as if we already didn't know they were all bs artists. They were still sticking to the story that this was all true. It was bad and I am dumber for having watched it. One of the kids just swears constantly just to hear himself swear. The mother saying she didn't know what the word ""hoax"" meant just put this over the top. That her ""confession"" wasn't really a confession because the officers confused her. It was all silly. The conversations with the police and neighbors brought some information to the documentary. But that was about it.",False
15,7,"Enjoyed the story, despised the protagonists",bt698nhj,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really struggle to rate a show where I don't like the featured people. It's a real conflict. If I give the show a good rating does it mean I'm endorsing the people in it? Of course not. But it feels like it.I think the family or liars. That's where I fall on it. Your mileage may vary.I had never heard this story so it was very interesting to watch it unfold and to see the aftermath.ABOUT MY REVIEWS:I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable.",False
16,7,What a Hoot!,andbrittain,n/a,15/08/2025,"This Doco is very entertaining and a lot of fun especially if you are a fan of UFO's, mad scientists and Hoax's and I tick every box. One of the best things about this production was all the extensive home video recorded by this eccentric loving family, I was moved by their interactions and all their activities were imbued with a effervescent sense of fun. For me this show was a real sugar hit however I can imagine it rubbing more serious and responsible adults the wrong way. The production was well crafted to trigger the full gamut of human emotions and ramp up the drama, well done. I really don't have a strong opinion about the truth of the situation at the core of this story but I enjoyed it none the less and I will say without crazy characters like this living amongst us the world would be a poorer place and a lot more boring.",False
17,2,Doesn't belong in Trainwreck series,merlijntouretta,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's more about Americans being dramatic than something that actually makes sense. Why always the craziness about aliens, problematic parents, dramatic media and trials? Very hard to watch, boring and almost couldn't get through it. In the end it isn't really a topic: there was not a boy in the balloon. Instead of moving on, Americans need their fair share of bombastic frenzies to blame someone.The worst of the Trainwreck series so far. The other ones have an actual topic about something that happened (in stead of what didn't happen) like the poop cruise, project x, woodstock and the canadian mayor. Those were fun to watch! Now we watched an hour of nothing.",True
18,1,America = Clown Show,GSK23,n/a,15/08/2025,"Netflix thinks we like stupid people because we are stupid people. Shame on them for making this utterly miserable and irresponsible ""documentary"". It's total BS.Thanks to this series and other docs (and, frankly, every news show online or on tv), the world now thinks America is Idiocracy realized. Yet, since most of us DO tune in to Tik Tok stunts and bad Netflix tv shows, we have become just that.No one shames these people. Instead, they do indeed get their 15 minutes of fame because we demand it.This family is embarrassing beyond belief. Unintelligent doofuses that can't see reality unless it's falsely presented on a screen. All I have to say to them is thank gawd I'm not them!!",False
19,1,"Shameless Then, Shameful Now",Fredolow,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is one of those documentaries that leaves you questioning not just the subjects at its centre, but the platform that decided to hand them a spotlight. Trainwreck: Balloon Boy revisits a story that should have stayed in the annals of infamy-a shameless hoax orchestrated by a family so hungry for fame that they faked their own child floating away in a homemade balloon. Emergency services scrambled, millions watched in horror, and the world was duped. All for a shot at reality TV.What's worse is how the children were dragged into the deception, coached into lying on national television while their parents grinned behind the scenes. It's exploitative, irresponsible, and still hard to watch even knowing how it ends.That Netflix has chosen to repackage this disgrace as entertainment feels tone-deaf. Some stories deserve scrutiny, but Trainwreck: Balloon Boy walks a fine line between exposure and enabling. Instead of thoughtful reflection or accountability, the show risks offering yet another platform to people who don't deserve it.Disgraceful behaviour then, and arguably just as disgraceful to give it this kind of publicity now.",True
20,8,A true Trainwreck,AsgeirJonsson,n/a,15/08/2025,"Review of Trainwreck: Balloon Boy (2025)
As a frequent viewer of documentaries, I was genuinely impressed by Trainwreck: Balloon Boy. Despite knowing the story in advance-that a father falsely claimed his son was trapped in a runaway balloon-the documentary still managed to captivate and surprise.What stands out most is how fairly and thoroughly the film presents both sides of the story. Director Gillian Pachter does an excellent job of not pushing a single narrative but instead allowing space for both the defense and the critics of the Heene family to be heard. This balance adds depth and credibility, giving viewers the room to form their own conclusions.The documentary is also technically well-crafted: sharp editing, strong pacing, and clever use of archival footage, including the infamous live broadcast and follow-up interviews. The emotional and psychological undercurrents of the story-fame, manipulation, and family dynamics-are handled with nuance.Now to the question of how to rate it. I often face the classic dilemma when reviewing documentaries:
1. Should I rate it based on how interesting or outrageous the topic is, even if the filmmaking itself is poor?2. Or should I reward documentaries that are masterfully constructed, even if the subject matter is unsettling or morally questionable?In this case, many seem to have leaned toward the second option-recognizing the skillful filmmaking even if they were deeply uncomfortable with the subject. And I agree. Although the protagonists' behavior is hard to sympathize with, the documentary itself is exceptionally well-executed.On IMDb, I would personally give this a solid 8/10, not because I enjoyed the content in a conventional sense, but because it's a compelling, well-produced, and thought-provoking piece of documentary storytelling.",False
21,3,The BIGGEST load of bull I have heard in a long time,Jamiec523,n/a,15/08/2025,"Keep in mind, before seeing this documentary I knew NOTHING about this story, not one thing. So I went into this documentary the same way I try to go into a lot of them, with a neutral mind and I prefer not to immediately judge.From the moment the 9-1-1 call started, I felt something was off. I'm not a parent but if my child snuck into a balloon that went up like that, I would be in hysterics. I know everyone reacts differently so I put that to my mind and gave Richard the benefit of the doubt. But when I saw the video of Falcon actually ""going up"" and the rest of the families reaction, particularly Richards when he was told Falcon was in there, that was some of the worst acting I've seen since I saw 2003's movie The Room. That's when I got major red flags in my mind but again, I wanted to see how this played out. There was also just something about the interviews from Mayumi and Richard that felt very disingenuous for some reason. Then I felt the same thing from Falcon when he came around. I found it interesting that they evidently couldn't afford cable but they could afford, as Richard stated himself, ""Hundreds of dollars"" to build that balloon. I found it interesting that Richard evidently didn't want to do anything with the media but he chose to do an interview with one of the biggest talk shows in the world, and I emphasize ""the world"" as Larry King Live was global. I'm sure he regrets that after what happened during that interview, let's just say ""The cats out of the balloon"".I could go on about how full of it Richard is but I don't want to ruin it for those that want to watch this dumpster fire of a story. But for someone that knew nothing about the story and doesn't like to be too skeptical, its amazing how on point my feelings were about this. Shame on this family for wasting all those police resources and messing with the emotions of so many people that genuinely cared about Falcon's wellbeing. Also Netflix? Please stop giving fame seekers like this a stage to continue their fictional performance, it's beneath you.",False
22,2,a string of lies and bad acting,elifseymademircioglu,n/a,15/08/2025,"I like the Trainwreck series. It's kinda cheesy but fun to watch. But this... this is a disaster.I'm sorry, but I won't buy it. It's clear every second of this is a script the father has concocted, forcing every family member to act. Absolutely bad acting, to boot. It's a terrible way to garner attention, and everyone noticed it, and they didn't give them the attention they wanted. But then years later, Netflix comes around and says, ""Here's the attention you ordered."" It's a huge disappointment that Netflix would give something like this a run for its money.I feel bad for the kids, Richard and his wife are showing us what bad parenting is, moment by moment. And the man shamelessly acts like the victim, oh my God, how is such shamelessness possible?",False
23,3,Re-hashing the past to try & rewrite history,LilyWai,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe other Trainwreck docos have been pretty good...but this one was a bomb. The interviews with the family were contrived & clearly led by their legal advice of their ""I'm a crier' attorney (his wiping away of the non existent tears was pretty bad acting).I understand people wanting to save face when their rep has been damaged but this was a pandering piece. I just kept thinking of that old saying 'where there's smoke, there's fire' comes to mind & the evidence against this family wasn't just smoke - it was a blazing forest fire.I will give them their dues, they tried EVERYTHING to plead their innocence here, from the video of the initial take off (which would be comedic if the acting wasn't so bad), to the 'I didn't understand English' defence of the wife (despite having a degree in English) to the Dad's polygraph conduct (I have a diabetic Father so I am well aware of the signs of true hyper/hypoglycemia) & so many more.To me this was another planned effort by the Heene Family to yet again gain some attention, squeeze some more money from the incident, shape the narrative to their own version & play victim of the judicial system that punished them.Let it go, you tried something, it didn't work out as you'd hoped & you got badly burned because of it. End of story.",True
24,1,Shame on Netflix,pure_ambition,n/a,15/08/2025,"This family was given the spotlight YET again. No surprise he dude uprooted his family to Florida, its the only place that would accept this kind of blatant sociopaths. I hope whatever he tried to ""plug"" at the end, fails. This families deserves nothing more from the public.

I feel bad for the kids being raised by parents like this and I'm sure the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Hopefully this is the last we will ever hear from this family.The obvious coaching and staging in the show is blatantly obvious.

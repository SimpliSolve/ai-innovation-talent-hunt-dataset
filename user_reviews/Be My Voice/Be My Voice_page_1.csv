1,10,The life of Iranian women,ramezanpanahs,n/a,17/08/2025,"Thanks to Masih Alinejad for expressing the life and suffering of women in Iran in this documentary. A life in which we do not even have the right to choose our clothes. All the freedoms you have in your daily life have become a dream for us. Many women in Iran have been imprisoned in the prisons of the Islamic Republic in order to one day be able to experience these freedoms. Saba Kord Afshari, Atena Daemi, Narges Mohammadi and hundreds of other women should be introduced to the world.",False
2,9,A passionate commitment to Iranian women's fight,alexbahman,n/a,17/08/2025,"Persson's previous documentaries, especially My Stolen Revolution, had considerable merit, but her portrait of Alinejad is more emotionally resonant and there is a greater sense of urgency in every scene that was missing in previous films. Although Be My Voice was finished before the news of the plot to kidnap Alinejad was released by the FBI, there is a clear sense that danger lurks around the corner.Alinejad's social media savvy has made her a particularly annoying thorn in the side of the Iranian regime, and her prominence has cost her dearly. Cyber trolls shadow her every move and create fake narratives (as can be seen in some of the other fake reviews here).The film's greatest strength and weakness is Alinejad's emotional rollercoaster as she tries to stay optimistic amid the chaos and threats around her. We can see only too well how deeply she feels everything.Very highly recommended.",False
3,2,A fake voice from iranian women,shka-film,n/a,17/08/2025,"It is kind of a reportaged film ,and who knows where the funds and expanses are coming from(maybe islamic republic himself ), as always before massih alinejad takes advantage of iranian women who are suppressed by Islamic republic ,shame to all who fund her for such a low quality pre-ordered documentaries.",False
4,10,A tour de force,vahidyucesoy,n/a,17/08/2025,Imagine growing in a country where your worth as a woman is half of men's. Imagine this situation being enshrined in the laws. And then imagine the same discriminatory political regime deploying its lobbyists in the West to sugarcoat this abject status quo.Masih Alinejad chronicles her journey of giving Iranian women a voice. She does it by amplifying the voices of women from within Iran. This documentary is a tour de force and it will open your eyes to the heroic fight of Iranian women and Masih's ability to relate to them through her childhood and her resolve to change the status quo.,False
5,1,massih alinejad is big charlatan,amitisgfx,n/a,17/08/2025,"Im from iran, I tell the factsshe is big charlatan
She is a very skilled liar.She has deceived many men and women of my land.It has a direct effect on the operation of arresting and torturing and killing all political prisoners.Do not be fooled by this filth
She is not a representative of us Iranian people
She is a double agent - from the side of the Islamic Republic of Western security systems, she has been assigned to destroy and collapse Iran.Please register my message if free speech is really important to youThe only person we know as our representative and lawyer is Prince Reza Pahlavi. Our king.",False
6,10,A true depiction of Iranian women in a fascist regime,zabasseri,n/a,17/08/2025,"I had seen another documentary, ""The Queen and I"" by Nahid. Similar to that one, her new creation is a sincere and clear depiction of the subject matter. As an Iranian woman I can testify the oppression we endure under the misogynistic theocracy of Iran. Thanks to fighters such as Masih and the film director herself, now we can get our long-time silenced voices heard.",False

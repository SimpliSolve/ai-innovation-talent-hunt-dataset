1,8,A welcome addition to the Missing 411 portfolio,kylejwillmott,n/a,16/08/2025,"Paulides approaches Missing 411 The UFO Connection with his usual detailed, analytical and critical thinking hat on. Like the two previous films he has successfully woven a layered and thought provoking tapestry, which like the topic itself, leaves more questions than answers.Whilst the most ardent skeptics can and will dismiss 85% of the content as mere coincidence and hearsay, Paulides presents enough strong material that the remaining 15% will leave viewers quite literally astounded.As the topic itself is evolving you feel these films evolve and offer different perspectives. Missing 411 The UFO Connection certainly feels like a strong turning point for the series and research, but certainly not the definitive end.Production values are very good and the film is extremely professional. I would encourage viewers to do their own research into the stories and topics post viewing and follow Dave Paulides as he continues his journey into Missing 411.",False
2,8,Compelling,wemartist,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether you have an interest in the UFO phenomenon or not, one thing you have to admit is that there's truly something strange going on. Some of these cases are just bizarre. Almost too bizarre, which in my opinion brings more credibility to the phenomenon. If you were going to make up a story, you wouldn't want the story to be so ridiculous that no one believes you. Well, as you'll find out there's a lot of wtf factors that these cases share with one another. While the movie lacks physical evidence (which you'd kinda expect with alien abduction cases), it more than makes up for it w/ credible testimonies. For example, the FBI agent that was interviewed. If what he said didn't give you chills, you might be a bit too closed minded. ""The government won't admit to things that they can't control."" If you have a deep interest in UFOs or maybe just a good unsolved mystery, I think you'll enjoy this. Even if you don't buy into this subject matter, it's still a great watch. One more thing... If you're German, don't go Elk hunting in the wilderness alone. Sounds way too bizarre right?",False
3,7,Finally Addresses The Elephant In The Room,AudioFileZ,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed the 2nd of these more than the first and now I find the third installment quite interesting too. This stuff makes the best campfire stories ever, but there are people who have lost loved ones and this is bracing and very real. Ever since I happened on the first visit of David Paladins on Coast To Coast AM I've felt there was some kind of paranormal element to quite a few of the missing folks in our national parks. Finally, Dave addresses this front and center. He picks some real mind-benders as well as the usual near immaculate disappearances with nothing to follow. I'll give Mr. Palaides points because he pretty much goes off on a real Twilight Zone one with the hunter who in the seventies was abducted by an alien with one cone for a hand! That one is really out there and is almost beyond anything I've heard. The others are downright believably spooky. While this serves as a kind of entertainment to most of us I come back to the lady who begins the documentary and is revisited at the end. You can see the devastation in her face due to losing her loved one to something that has no closure. For every missing person there is a trail of tears the family and loved ones must endure. While it's easy to brush-off a lot of this stuff when it's not your loved one, it is entirely a different matter as we see here. All viewers must process this in their own way, but I find it highly interesting and quite disturbing.",False

UFO's all over the wilderness .Missing people and the ufo connection definitely seems like it . I believe people will think this is his best documentary . I agree .Very good , I enjoyed it . I give all these ufo type shows a max 6 . They lose points for not proving anything . Dave is pushing 7 on this . Getting close to something .Skin Walker Ranch and Missing 411 cases maybe something there .Presented ,vary well , scary, fascinating , and makes you want the sequel .Prion disease is just crazy and ufo's are testing cattle and wild life ?

5,7,Missing 411 UFO Connection,DeusWar,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDavid Paulides has once again created a high quality documentary in continuation with his previous ""Missing 411"" movies. However, this documentary takes a different route from others in that it delves into the ""Supernatural"" world of U. F. Os in their relation to missing people.Anyone who has been watching Paulides has seen his passionate presentations as well as excellent story telling skills demonstrated on his YouTube channel. It seems like he has been waiting to bring out his true feeling which lie with the Supernatural explanations of these mysterious disappearances. Whether they be ""Bigfoot"" or ""UFO"" related, Paulides pushes the viewer into considering these explanations for the missing person problem.He attempts to describe the UFO phenomenon in physical terms as opposed to spiritual terms, however he does allude to the possibility of other dimensions for the origin of objects. I think he should have considered more of the missing subject's belief-systems and UFO/New Age connections during the interview process. It seems that some of the missing had UFO beliefs/contacts prior to their gone missing, which likely contributed to their future issues.Joseph Jordan who works with MUFON and has a group called CE4 research, has done extensive interviewing and research with alien abductees and has found a lot of truth that could help Mr. Paulides. I hope they can connect sometime in the future. He has helped a lot of abductees. If you are suffering from any alien related issues, please check out CE4 research.Otherwise, this documentary is a good place to start to ask questions about what is beyond our physical realm.",True
6,6,"Tittilating, but ...",dmdcheney,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMissing 411: THE UFO Connection is as titillating as it is interesting. Who doesn't llove a good Bigfoot/alien/mystery film? The quality of this film is on par with David's other projects. I am a fan, generally speaking. But more the skeptic when it comes to details.With regard to the claims and innuendos, I think some are over-reaching. Paulides does not make his case, for me. I'd love to hear what a statistician might have to say about the number of Elk hunters and people with a Germanic surname going missing are in comparison to the wider pool of missing persons in North American forests and public parks. The statistician's *paychecks should NOT be signed by David or any of his associates in order that people get a complete, uncompromised picture. More often than not, the opinion of ""experts"" is in line with their paymasters.And, I have to ask ... Why would inter-dimensional beings, or extraterrestrials, prefer German elk hunters? -Or German scientists, per another Paulides suggestion. I mean, really?!?",True
7,10,Strap In For a Mind Bending Reality Check,mikeheslin-10805,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was immediately sucked in to this field of research one night after hearing ""Missing 411"" being mentioned by a guest on JRE. That same night, I searched missing 411 on streaming platforms and I began watching both of Dave's first 2 documentary's.As someone who grew up on a big farm with 20 acres of woods, the Missing 411: The Hunted really shocked me. Not to mention now having a 2 year old son, the original Missing 411 about the missing children also left me shook.Now with the newest documentary, Dave never leaves anything to be desired. This one is just as gripping. These documentaries will challenge your views of the reality around you, and that's as powerful as a documentary can be. I look forward to whatever he puts out. Subscribe to his YouTube channel ""Canam Missing Project"" for weekly content. Well done Dave.",False
8,10,Eye-Opening and Informative!,praisngod82,n/a,16/08/2025,"This Doc was extremely well made, filled with eye witness testimonies and interviews held on location of the strange events. Dave Paulides takes his methodical investigative skills as a Police Investigator and applies them to this unconvetional but fascinating subject; producing a fact-filled documentory I couldn't take my eyes off of. I'm going to watch it again and again. I appreciate this filmmakers courage in following where the facts lead, regardless of where that is.It's been a long time since I've seen a doc that deals with this kind of subject and not have it desend into a series of crazy speculations leading no where. The film maker respects his audience enough to present the facts and leave us to our own conclusions and opinions.",False
9,4,This deserves no more than 4.5,scfitandfabulous,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have to disagree with everyone I'm afraid. Nothing I expected and I wish I watched something else.I don't disbelieve were being visited by something we don't understand. My parents and I saw something in about 1979 over the hills in Wales England but this program just seemed like a lot of coincidences put together.We have to believe everyone on the show was a credible source for anything to be more than a coincidence. There are some credible people but they're only giving their opinion on things, nothing is factual. I think there's also some not so credible. I think they're desperate to believe something has happened to their loved one to try and make sense of something so awful that they've experienced. They said goodbye expecting to see each other a day or so later yet they never see their loved one again ......... but so many people go missing everyday.The elke thing is just random. Out of all the animals in the world the aliens are obsessed with are Elkes! Lol!Lots of coincidences and clutching at straws don't make a good watch for me. There's also serious lack of actual video footage except for clips that are already all over the internet.",True
10,10,Another great Missing 411 movie,sperare-30224,n/a,16/08/2025,The Missing 411 movies are captivating. Dave does a fantastic job of not only bringing a spotlight to these missing people but exposing the oddities of each case. This movie is no exception. Some may discount it because of the UFO angle but I found it very interesting especially the gentleman who was abducted and then returned. I'm surprised his case isnt more well known. Dave has written a ton of books about missing individuals so I recommend reading any one of them as they are just as good. He also has a youtube page where he talks about missing people which is also recommend. Enjoy the movie.,False
11,1,Very sloppy,taxicamream,n/a,16/08/2025,"First thing .When your in the first few minutes and in the basement I assume . You have these talking points of German ancestry,males,near granite etc.... And you have one that is elk hunters . Fine cool. But on the desk you have a fallow deer shed. Fallow deer are native to Europe. In fact fallow deer are naturally resistant to CWD. No problem with it being on your desk I just like continuity and consistency . Many won't pick up on that .When your showing the 4 elk getting abducted by the ufo . You have two elk cows and one elk bull AND a red stag . Red stag are native to Europe . Not anywhere in the USA . Whoever made your movie in the field of things needs to do some more research and paying attention .When there is a scene where you discuss CWD you show a video of a fallow deer doe . Like mention they are cwd resistant and not even native to USA or huntable other than game farms .Later in the film you show a hillside with cop cars on there with people out looking . That's in Spain that footage it says policia and I've seen those same views and habitat in Spain not in America . That's more Mediterranean than America .Then you show a whitetail deer doe and talk about guys hunting them . They aren't hunting whitetails in the north west of Pacific north west they are going to hunt black tail and mule deer a whole nother ball game . Whitetails are out that far west .Onto the guy that that went missing that you interviewed his girlfriend . The full story wasn't told. There wasn't any evidence represented like a cell phone that showed tracking data or ""pinging"" no photos or descriptions or depictions of what the scene looked like.The whole cwd thing has absolutely no connections to aliens or missing people . If anyone that's a hunter reads this or sees this. Knows that diseases have been around for millions of years and CWD isn't as deadly to normal people and animals as he makes it out to be.The animations and recreations are very bad. This is like high school kid cgi.The only thing good about this movie was the lighting and scenery for the in person interviews .The things in the movie are sloppy and clear any American or outdoorsman didn't overlook it and edit this .You don't list or show your sources for the data . And the raw data isn't shown or discussed.This guy edits his YouTube channel to delete discriminating and challenging comments. He doesn't address the said comments. Go look for yourself you never see any comments that challenge his stories . This was a money grab movie. He couldn't cut the cheddar and went to the ""craziest"" foolish easily swayed people on the planet the ufo people .Even in those YouTube videos there's no hard evidence or sources . He just angrily states go look it up I've put it in my books. ""Believe me "" . This is an older guy going through a midlife crisis . Imagine you get on Facebook this is the guy the the ""boomers"" get taken advantage of and buy the books and movies. He says the key words like Tucker Carlson does and gets them hooked.Make sure you do some background checks and Google searching on the guy before you hero worship. I am interested in the missing person cases but once you look at other sources and people doing the same work almost all these cases are explained and as much as I want them to be paranormal or unexplained they are very explainable .This was a very disappointing movie . The guy all the time hypes it up and demands people see it to get the 10 bucks out of people . I'm a sucker and I paid the money.This guy gives a bad name to the subject.",False
12,10,Next Level Film,tianew-73363,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched Missing 411 The UFO Connection and it's by far the best documentary of 2022 perhaps the best documentary on the subject of all time. I've watched nearly 75-80 documentaries on this subject alone. The way Dave Paulides lays out each story is what draws me back to the Missing 411 series. He's professional, asks great questions then connects each story with a common denominator. If you've never seen his other two films on the missing I suggest you watch those first.The best film thus far on the entire subject. Don't miss this one folks, you truly won't be disappointed. Watch the entire film including the credits as Mr. Paulides has included full interviews thereafter.",False
13,10,Third time is the charm!,danfurtado-11221,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like most of daves work, watched his three documentaries and a couple of his books so I am a fan. I would say without a doubt this is the best of the bunch and his most interesting documentary.I don't believe you should accept his every single word as gospel but many strange things happen once you get above the treeline. Their are alot of counter arguments to davids theories but few of the cases he covers get's a real satisfactory explanation.If you spend any amount of time in the woods camping or hunting you should probably take a grain of salt and take a look at his work. Draw your own conclusions but in regards to The UFO connection I find this the most likely paranormal explanation in regards to his work.Interesting cases, good interviews and nice cinematography, the quality got better with each release. If you have to pick one it's UFO CONNECTION, The Hunted, Missing 411 in that exact order.",False
14,10,Dave is real one,jacroll,n/a,16/08/2025,The best one yet. I really consider Dave at the forefront of the investigation into the phenomenon. In this one he minces no words and directly connects the Missing 411 phenomenon to the events at Skinwalker Ranch and UFOs. Daves open mindedness and matter-of-fact investigation technique is at the forefront of bringing us closer to understanding this deeply disturbing presence that seems to come and go from the world we inhabit. This is best in class content in the field of the phenomenon and the paranormal. The only critique I would have is Dave sometimes you need to slow down and let the audience steep in the mystery 9/10.,False
15,1,Still no theories,stacethecase,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've followed the 411 for a while now and have always been interested in the cases. After all this time though, there's never any scientific research to find out what the 411 really is. After finding errors with the creators ""research"" many times and no updates when missing people were found, it seems like this is nothing mysterious. While some turn tragic, they are more along the lines of unsolved mysteries than a deeper, mysterious phenomenon. That would be fine, if the creator didn't try to dupe his audience. I'm sure they would still follow his work, and appreciate the integrity.Instead, the viewer is going based on stories and interviews the creator leads and makes fit his narrative. There are no sources named to back up the stories other than by someones word. Then looking into the cases reveals details are wrong or omitted. The missing people stories are intriguing yes, and there probably are people seeing strange things in the sky. But arranging the missing stories to fit the profile and throwing in some ufo stories to try and create a deep mystery behind the victims disappearances is not a credible discovery. To sum it up, they are interesting stories to hear, but not backed by any evidence that convinced me there were UFOs responsible for the vast majority of the cases.",False
16,9,"Ridiculously better than I thought it might be, based upon reading the film by it's poster!",medwards-85263,n/a,16/08/2025,"David Paulides is one of the most interesting characters working outside of mainstream journalism/publishing/documentary film making.A former police officer of 20 years, a person who has two Master Degrees and worked for a number of years in HR for big tech companies, his road to doing this has been a long and winding one.Whilst working in HR, he was approached discretely by the owner of the company, a multimillionaire, who was interested in contracting Paulides due to his police and detective background. The owner of the company had seen what could only be described as a Big Foot out in the woods many years ago, and being rich now, wanted to task someone with doing a real in-depth research project and sorting out real sightings from BS. Paulides initially turned him down, only to be persuaded to do it by the temptation of making a book out of his findings. Paulides went on to engage in tireless and deep research and publish two books about Big Foot.It was whilst in a National Park investigating another fringe topic many years later that Paulides was approached by two off-duty park rangers, who told him about their concerns over the amount of people who had disappeared under highly unusual circumstances in their park during the nearly thirty years of their service. They told him how initially there might be huge coverage both by SAR and press, but once any search had been called off, interest soon waned. Yet they never forgot, and were concerned that, even though many people never, ever turned up, even as a dead body or remains, there were never any follow up investigations.Paulides called some detective friends of his to check out the veracity of their account and soon found there was indeed serious grounds for concern.After he had investigated many hundreds of different disappearances he began to see a disturbing repeated set of circumstances surrounding these events, or as he terms it, profile points. He eliminated from his list any case that was demonstrably the result of criminal activity, animal attack or anyone with a reason to have run away.He started to self-publish books detailing accounts of all the people who had disappeared, using newspaper and police/coroner reports from the time gained through Freedom of Information requests, and where he was able his own investigations interviewing witnesses, police, SAR team members etc.After he had published about eight of these books, his son encouraged him to start making shorts video clips going with a camera to where someone had disappeared and outlining the basic details of the case, placing these clips on a YouTube channel. This was partly I believe in response to and popularity of the uploading on YouTube of various radio interviews Paulides had given over the years (most specifically to Coast to Coast) listened to by tens of thousands of people (myself included).Eventually Ben Paulides persuaded his dad to take a step further and make feature length documentaries. Ben co-directed the first of these, the excellent Missing 411 from 2016. It was a brilliant film, concentrating on children who had gone missing and had turned up, in most cases sadly dead, many, many miles away in very unusual locations (such as halfway up the side of a scree field on the side of a mountain) that in no way should a lost child have been able to get to themselves especially in the time frame between when they went missing and when they were found. I would personally rate this first film 7 out of 10, as whilst it is brilliant, it airs on the side of caution a lot, and it is possible to dismiss it as 'okay, unusual, but not impossible'.The second film he made came out in 2019, and to me it was a massive improvement, as it focused on people who have a large amount of experience in the woods/nature, pretty honed survival skills, and are armed! Missing 411: The Hunted, I would rate as an 8 out of 10.It was much more thought provoking, and try as I might, I just could not rationally explain how any of the cases outlined could have happened. Also, there is a brilliant section were Paulides talks to experts in the wilds and gives a very detailed list of what you should do and what you should take to make sure you yourself do not end up one of Paludes cases. This to me, goes above and beyond just a documentary maker telling a story, this is educational and preventative measures, well done Mr. Paulides.Now we come to this film. It took Paulides three years to compile this work! Hampered in no small part by the outbreak of CoVid 19 and the incredibly sad death of his own son through suicide. According to Paulides this film took the most amount out of him both financially and logistically. It was a long, arduous and difficult journey, but for me, it was incredibly worthwhile.I would personally rate this documentary as a 9 out of 10. So you can see for me there is a steady progression in quality for each of his feature length films. I must confess I was worried about the nature of this film looking at the poster. I am an incredibly sceptical person, and do not just believe in any conspiracy theory just because it is intriguing. It is one of the prime things that attracted me to the work of Paulides in the first place. For many, many years he has refused in interviews, in his books, on his YouTube channel and in his documentaries to be drawn on what he thinks the root cause of these mysterious disappearances. Partly because he genuinely did not know, he could not figure out one thing that made sense across all the cases. He was also quite open to the idea that there could be several different route causes that just happen to all coincide with the same result (i.e. People going missing) partly because he did not want to be wrong in his estimation, only for his idea as to the cause to later be disproved and therefore all his work discredited.As a former police detective, he understands the importance of evidence. After all many of the people he arrested over the years would not be able to be prosecuted if only circumstantial evidence was provided. Therefore, before drawing any conclusions, he has always demanded that there be real, tangible proof of the concept.So it was, seeing the image of the UFO and the name of the documentary, I was quite worried that this would be a massive departure from his usual cautious approach. I need not have worried.Paulides has already steered us to the conclusion in his previous work that there is no satisfactory standard explanation for what is happening, and that, without a rational reason for these bizarre disappearances, we should look for the not-normal, the paranormal as it were. This is simply more of the same. As the title suggests, Paulides is presenting us with connections, he is not definitively saying that UFOs are responsible for these disappearances. He is not even saying that UFOs are definitely the work of alien creatures. He is merely presenting us with the startling coincidences' that seem to suggest there might be a connection.I am sceptical, but I am also open minded. Three times in my life I have witnessed things in the sky that I could not readily explain. Two of them I am fairly sure are misinterpreted human technology. One of them, well, it was so bizarre I too am drawn towards a paranormal explanation being the only option.Whether you believe in the 'paranormal' implications of Paulides work or not probably depends on your state of mind, which probably depends on whether you yourself have ever encountered anything unusual and how you have gone on to explain or rationalise that.I am a scientifically minded person. I believe that everything, eventually will be able to be rationally explained to everyone's full satisfaction by pursuing the scientific method of gathering and analysing data.Even as a sceptic, I can see how sometimes thing happen or are seen that you simply cannot explain. What was it we witnessed that day I cannot say. I have never again seen anything like it. Therefore, I am open to the witness accounts of some of the things described in this documentary.I urge you to approach this with the same open mindedness, and you will be richly rewarded. Paulides talks to some very, very credible people, most notably a former FBI agent. All of whom seem to confirm that there are things happening that just defy any kind of rational explanation.This documentary is well planned, executed and again, incredibly thought provoking. I am sure just by having the name UFO in the title it will put many people off, but I am also sure that it will open many more people up to the truly intriguing Missing 411 phenomenon than have ever heard of it before. I really hope Paulides is not only able to make his money back on this investment (don't forget these are really self-funded/crowd funded type docs - there is no central big studio or TV company behind them) but not only that, make a healthy profit so that he can spend more time making more documentaries. I genuinely think he is one of the best documentary makers out there right now. If the trend continues, I guess his next documentary will have to get a 10 out of 10 from me.Thank your David Paulides. Keep up the good work.",False

20,3,Not up to its predecessors,mreha-09209,n/a,16/08/2025,"I actually really enjoyed the first two Missing 411 movies, but this latest entry in the series is less about investigation and more about credulity and completely outlandish speculation. It cherry picks a very small number of cases, all of which involve wildly imaginative and unsubstantiated stories. Worse, Paulides simply takes every bit of these fantasies as fact, without even a handwave towards skepticism. The documentary proposes some kind of connecting between alien abductions and chronic wasting disease, although it's unclear what they're suggesting is the connection exactly. Apparently aliens are hunting elk and fishing because they're hungry? One particularly memorable moment is when a hunter's cartoonish drawing of an alien with antennae and a cone for a hand is accepted as absolute fact, case closed.Paulides credentials as an investigator are part of the draw of the series, but it only works if he actually investigates. This one was a real disappointment - I suspect he's just pandering now to credulous viewers for the profit.",False

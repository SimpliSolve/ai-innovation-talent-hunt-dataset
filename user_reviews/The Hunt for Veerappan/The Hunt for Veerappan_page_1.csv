1,9,The Way It Happened - Finally,VeekeyBharti,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very well documented timeline of this dreaded criminal. From late 80s until early 2000s. How so many different people involved in his life from wife to police to STF personals to friends to villagers to negotiators to traders account for his life is something you cannot find in any movie or book so far done on him,Personal note not amounting to the rating given: I remember while growing up in Bangalore the stories of Veerappan and his atrocities were norm. I was in 2nd year of my college when Rajkumar was kidnapped and the days followed were horrific to say the least. The thing was that it took a kidnapping of an actor, though well revered to take this man more seriously than ever. Not that there were no sincere efforts were being taken to nab him but it all were failing due to many reasons which this documentary has shown quite aptly.",False
2,7,Close to truth.,sosrivi,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is produced in accordance with international standards. Congratulations to the technical and direction teams. The documentary strives to be objective, but if they go into further detail, Veerappan may become a hero. Police violence has never been presented in detail; what Walter Devaram and Rambo did to the people has never been shown. The state police and the gang never care about the people caught between the two. Even after 35 years, the village and its inhabitants have not changed. There was no development to improve their standard of living. The climax was not fully explained. They appear to have agreed to a police-created cover-up scenario. No one is born a criminal; society and their environment shape them. The only thing I admire about Veerappan is his ability to survive in the forest. No one has gotten close to him in nearly 20 years of searching.",False
3,8,A fascinating watch!,TreeFiddy53,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a kid growing up during peak Veerappan times, during the kidnapping, all I remember about the whole thing are the features on Sun News and what the elders used to talk about. I also remember the ""Veerappan ah pudika vakku illa"" dialogue from Kaakha Kaakha. Given my limited knowledge about Veerappan and all the events from back then, this was a very fascinating watch.This is a 4-ep documentary, not a biopic, about the approach that the police forces from TN and KA had to capture him. Several individuals directly involved in the process, including Veerappan's wife Muthulakshmi speak in this doc. The editing and the storytelling in worth the 3.5-4 hours. The narration is slow but worth it. The original doc has a mix of English, Tamil and Kannada narration, but there's a full dub as well, in case you're wondering.",False
4,10,Interesting and spine chilling,Biswas_,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's no doubt about one thing , the life of Veerappan and the major attempts made by the govts of Karnataka and TN itself is a full real life movie experience. Witnessing it unfold in this documentary was no short of a blockbuster thrilling movie.I had the basic knowledge of Veerappan that he was someone who was difficult to catch but how and why I never really bothered to research , after all why would I research about a criminal. This is why I decided to watch this documentary which presents a pretty detailed picture of who exactly Veerappan was, what he did, what turned him into the monster he became and simultaneously what were all the efforts made by the police to nab him. All was extremely interesting yet spine chilling for me to hear.The spine chilling parts were especially to witness the constant defeat of police force and the rare pictures shown in this documentary of the bombing or killing sites . Veerappan was always one step ahead of the police. The fictional character Pushpa (Allu Arjun ) is heavily inspired by Veerappan actually and one realises this when one sees both characters. It was quite shocking to see Veerappan make the govts of two states dance to his tunes , something I was never aware of.Many narrators present in this documentary from policemen to journalists to insiders of Veerappan gang narrate the tale and it's always interesting to hear it directly from their mouth but the makers struck gold by getting in the wife of Veerappan Mutulakshmi who manages to give us an insight into a never heard before Veerappan's mindset and what he used to think from his pov , for example when his men got killed how angry he used to feel which forced him to take revenge against policemen like Shakeel Ahmed . You will see a sense of no remorse on MutuLakshmi's face when she says what Veerappan did was absolutely right which again sent shivers down my spine .Go watch this series if you want some insight into Veerappan and all the hohum around him . Literally this man was exactly what Osama was to US . This documentary is your time worth spending !",False
5,10,Brilliant!,lakshmanselvaraj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great series. Not able to sleep without watching complete series!!!Must watch series if you're interested in crime thrillers.It's all about the Indian bandit Veerappan.I'm a 90s kid. We have heard a lot about Veerappan from the early age of my life. That gave a eager to watch this series

6,8,After The deepest breath Netflix stuns with this one too,aman01091986,n/a,16/08/2025,Was waiting for this series from long time. The actual timeline with the most accurate details makes this documentary so good. You will be glued to it until you finish it. We all in our childhood heard a lot about Veerappan(Indians) here is all the details and all the crimes he committed we only know him for the smuggling of chandan but it was way more than that and Netflix makes sure that every detail is shown as accurate as possible. You will feel the fear and you will feel the anxiety the only thing you will not feel is the time as it is a pure entertainer and even if you are not into documentaries I assure you this can be exception in your watchlist.,False

8,7,Unmasking Veerappan: The Enigmatic Anti-Hero's Life Journey,iknafilms,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix's gripping four-part documentary 'The Hunt for Veerappan' delves into the life of the notorious and mysterious forest brigand. Veerappan, known for being a bandit, activist, poacher, smuggler, and murderer, leads a gang responsible for numerous casualties among police and civilians. The visually stunning portrayal explores his world of Chandankath smuggling and horrifying ivory trade, while skillfully presenting key moments like the kidnapping of Kannada Megastar Rajkumar. However, the series lacks clarity on the reasons behind Veerappan's early criminal activity and avoids depicting his background. Some viewers may also notice a toned-down representation of police brutality and find the ending puzzling. Despite these points, the expertly crafted docu-series captivates and leaves a lasting impact on the audience.",False
9,9,HUNT FOR VEERAPPAN,iyerravikumar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw the Netflix Movie, ""The Hunt for Veerappan"", the most dreaded man called sandalwood Verappan! He was said to have killed closed 220 people 50 policemen, killed 1000 elephants in a span of 20 years so!!The Docufilm was very well made laced with interview from his wife Muthukakshmi, close associate and living policemen who had been part of STF to nab him. An objective enacted film without taking any sides of the two state govts or policemen or Veerappan and his gang.Though one may argue that he was a southie robinhood, in my opinion at least, there can be no justification in glorifying his actions ""as a hero""! A society cannot evolve n survive with gun culture- one wrong cannot annul another! And this holds good for both Veerappan and the police who were deployed by cunning looting politicians who ruled both the states during the time...
We know for a fact that any smuggly -remember in 1990s till 2004 killing of 1000 elephants n felling of lakhs of sandlewood trees ,now reduced to 25%,could not have been achieved without connivance of politicians n police with the gangster like Veerappan!!!But i liked the objective way the producers n director have made it. KUDOS TO THEM. ..
In fact it is far far better than Oppenheimer the holywood hypocritical docubio!!",False
10,7,"Well made, tons of interviews, evil man.",deloudelouvain,n/a,16/08/2025,"I must not have paid too much attention at the news at that time or maybe it was too far from my bed but I don't remember anything from that manhunt. Interesting documentary though, well made, and consisting mostly of interviews from people that were involved in that case, whether it be sympathizers, family, media, or government agencies. Everybody has an opinion about him, from evil to almost saviour, the truth is that he wasn't a good guy, neither were the government agencies nor his wife. Amazing that it took them so long before catching him. I sincerly doubt he would have made it that long almost anywhere else in the world.",False
11,10,simple and neatly presented,pbrajsg,n/a,16/08/2025,"A simple editing choice, a momentary musical cue, or even the decision to give one talking head more screen time than another can alter a viewer's perception of the story. But after a moderately engaging three-and-a-half hours during which you can almost sense director Selvamani Selvaraj bursting at the seams to appreciate Veerappan's pluck, he makes the unambiguously bold choice of conveying his true feelings by including a decisive verbal comment made by the man interviewing Veerappan's widow - it's unclear if the interviewer is Selvaraj himself - and declaring that the manner in which the gangster was killed wasn't 'brave'.",False
12,7,One of the better Indian true crime documentaries you'll find on Netflix! [+70%],arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"The one thing the makers can be proud of when it comes to this 4-episode miniseries is that it's solidly made and put together. It offers three perspectives: that of Veerappan's acquaintances (including his wife Muthulakshmi), the special task force that was hot on his trail (but never quite close to nabbing him) for nearly 20 years, and the media folks involved at the time. While this paves the way for a well-rounded approach, some questions are still left hanging. We get to know near-to-nothing about Veerappan's upbringing and what drove him to become a poacher, a smuggler, and eventually a kidnapper/murderer (except for greed and notoriety). The episodes are neatly cut and sorted, with each chapter proving to be decisive in the lives of Veerappan and those that revolve around him.On the bright side, we get finer details regarding the ""Dr. Rajkumar kidnap & release"" saga. When you hear one of the victims say he remembers all the details 23 years later, you know how pivotal those days in capture would've been. It also paints a more humanized picture of Veerappan, shedding a fair amount of light on the people he may have inadvertently helped out while he was carrying out his 'revolutionary' antics. The STF's losses, the conflicts between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Veerappan's gradual change of mind when he spends time with his wife and daughter - all of this is given ample time.There are some incredible visuals on display too, be it of the forest or the subtle reenactment of events. Of all the folks interviewed, the clear standout (by a mile) is Muthulakshmi, whose strong, bold demeanour is evident all through, whether it's how she responds with composure, the way she laughs, or just her sitting posture. Add to that, we get to hear from Veerappan himself through various cassette tapes he shared with people over the years. A few doubts remain about the killing of Veerappan, but that's left as a loose end. Selvamani Selvaraj, the writer-director, is an interesting filmmaker to watch out for. He's making his next with Dulquer Salmaan.",False
13,1,4 Hours of Misinformation - My First review,rameshviscomer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler1. This is the neatly stitched police story. Nothing is new here. The 4 episodes are just the compilation of various exclusive news channel content.2. They didn't do any deep research. They failed to provide detailed content.3. Even though the series is completely based on the police narration the makers failed to provide those in detailed manner.4. Kolathur Mani's many hours of interview was trimmed and intentionally juxtaposed to create an image that the death of Veerappan was relief to many.5. Everyone know Why that DFO was killed. Selvamani seems to be the blood relation of that DFO; Selvamani put his hardcore efforts in the first episode to Glorify thhat DFO.6. This Docu-series is the complete trash. It lacks details in every aspect.7. 4 Hours of misinformation. Nothing more than that.8. Only good thing in this series is a police officer partially admitted the STF atrocities including rape, torture and enconuters.9. There are more than 60 rape victims, who openly spoke about this and some didn't want to speak about sexual violence committed against them(So,60+). There are more than 150 people killed in fake police encounters. These all happened during ""The Hunt for Veerappan"". But, this series failed to cover those information and voluntarily suppressed.10. Trasho! Trash!!!",True
14,8,Unexpected,abhishek-dann,n/a,16/08/2025,"Started watching this with no expectation, but it was a surprise. Never expected such details and perspectives of all these people being shown here , his wife, ex gang members and the police officers involved, their stories were explained very well so that we understand the motives behind their decisions or actions, the third episode seems a bit dragged but things get back on track in the final episode, was hooked to the story throughout the series as this is the first time veerappan's story was explained so well. Definitely worth a watch and must watch for people who don't know about veerappan's story.",False
15,10,Better than a movie versions,gmmurugan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great experience overall. It's engaging like a thriller with lot of visuals, audio and real facts. Must watch and awesome work entire team. The records, videos, political news were very informative. Lot of work gone there. Background score is awesome. Also the visuals to simulate the places.People who worked and faced all the struggles showcase their emotions in their native language.Officials and both victims played their part and spoken to the heart.As usual the man of crime and his death ends
as a mystery. Wish there should be an extension uncut version of this or some making video of each important things.",False
16,10,"""Unveiling Veerappan: A Riveting Dive into India's Most Intense Manhunt""",raj5251,n/a,16/08/2025,"The hunt for Veerappan is a gripping and insightful exploration of the relentless pursuit of one of India's most notorious criminals. With in-depth interviews, archival footage, and a well-structured narrative, the documentary provides a comprehensive look at the challenges faced by law enforcement in capturing the elusive bandit. It delves into the complex socio-political landscape surrounding the manhunt, shedding light on the moral dilemmas and ethical questions that arose. While occasionally pacing slows, overall, the documentary offers a compelling and informative account of the efforts to bring Veerappan to justice.",False
17,10,Gripping and captivating! Well done Netflix,ankit-iitkgp07,n/a,16/08/2025,"Veerappan was India's Pablo Escobar. He challenged the state and honestly, in his prime was more powerful than state.The Netflix series has done a great job to depict this story with full honesty without taking sides and exposed the brutality of Veerappan's techniques especially when it comes to killing police officers and STF.It's a must watch to understand this dark chapter of South India's most wanted fugitive and appreciate the brave efforts of STF officers. The shows ends on a balanced note and leaves the viewer to decide whether the failure of our society to take care of the most poorest of its citizen are the reason for someone to become Veerappan.",False
18,10,Unprecedented.,bhanwisingh,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can't remember the last time some content made me feel so deeply. Call it an attempt to glorify a ""criminal"" but he was a hero, character and grit and bravado, unlike most living people who sacrifice their spine for a job. WHAT AN ABSOLUTE PHENOMENON. Took a long moment after it was finished. If he were alive, I would have gone and met him if I could. THE DOCUMENTARY DOES ABSOLUTE JUSTICE TO THE LARGER THAN LIFE CHARACTER IT WAS, while also covering the other side of the story. I just wish he didn't kill those elephants, thats all. May Maa Kaali lap you up Lion King. UNMISSABLE, MAKERS! YOU HAVE MY HEART.",False
19,9,When it comes to an Indian doc Netflix never dissapoints,appusnikhil,n/a,16/08/2025,"Once again Netflix have proved that they are the best in the field of making some classy Indian documentary. Especially documentaries like this one are very good for people like me from the Gen Z cohort. There used to be times when the whole household used to talk about Veerapan and everyone has seen that long mustache image of Veerappan in news and the Internet. But we the Gen Z generation never knew the story of Veerappan and here comes the documentary.Now coming to the documentary- It is a very well-made documentary. The creators give us a comprehensive story by interviewing most of the living people connected with Veerappan. Rather than taking a side, the creators are trying to convey the complete story, and its our role to choose the sides. I'm not going into spoilers, do give it a watch. Thanks!",False
20,4,Dosent go beyond headlines,ksdp-68285,n/a,16/08/2025,"Could have been riveting piece of India's biggest manhunt ,the makers missed a chance by sticking to conventional and know narrative of forest brigand
Especially the drama the tension that was unruffled after abduction of actor Rajkumar merely followed the headlines and news clippings not explored what actually led to the kidnappings and it does not address the widely prevailing speculation that he had backing of Tamil Nadu government
Dosent speak about his political patronage he received from both the states ,merely relies on assortments of newspapers headlines and tv clippings

24,10,Revealing and scarring,hemanthsingh-56980,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was, like everyone in my generation, violently exposed to Veerappan's misadventures. I've lived thru the Cauvery issue riots and when Dr. Rajkumar was kidnapped, the lava almost bubbled over. News about Veerappan ebbed and flowed and as is the norm, the general public were aware about a few bits of the whole operation. Only the govt bits that the govt wanted us to know.The documentary ""The Hunt for Veerappan"" on Netflix is a scintillating piece of work. This series takes the threads apart one by one and exposes the intricacies of the entire drama and reveals quite a few immoral acts of the STF and Karnataka govt.It's been brilliantly shot and every frame is an aura in itself. A special mention for the background music. Oh! If the language and visions aren't enough to chill you, the BGM ensures that you shiver your bones off. Absolutely love the theme song!Get yourself a brand new set of earphones, shut yourself for 4 hours, and soak in the documentary.It's revealing and scarring.",False
25,8,The Forest King,EntertheRaptor,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting documentary. Veerappan is a name that everyone who grew up in the 90s in South India knows. I remember hearing the news about him kidnapping the actor, Rajkumar, when I was in Manipur in Northeast India. Before that, he was mainly famous for being a sandalwood smuggler, but that kidnapping added to his notoriety.It's hard to fully understand someone who takes on the law because we only get to see and hear what the media reveals. Yet, living with the primitive inclination of an eye for an eye is something anyone in civilized society frowns upon. In the most simple terms, that is what Veerappan was. He lived like the law did not apply to him. For some of us who secretly fantasize about anarchy and a lawless world, that is the ultimate level of truth. No pretense, no justification, just pure cunning and violence.There is no excuse for the murders he committed and the elephants his gang poached. Those who live by violence will die by it.Many villagers and police officers were killed, and families were traumatized by the fiasco of capturing Veerappan. In the end, he left behind a devoted wife and two daughters that he never got to spend time with. If he had a moment to look back at his life before he died, I wonder if he felt peace or regret.",False

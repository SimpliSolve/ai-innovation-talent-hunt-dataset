1,8,The gaming documentary I didn't know I needed!,memphisspence,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you are an 80's kid, you'll love this documentary! Mortal Kombat, Narc, and NBA Jam were staples of our childhood. This film captures the essence of that historic timeframe.The psychology behind game design is front and center here. Every detail that you wanted to know about Midway, their competition, the games themselves, and so much more is also present in this documentary.I personally didn't know that there was as much drama and friction inside of the Williams/Bally/Midway collaboration. I'm not sure that some of those guys like each other to this day.Overall, getting to know the names behind the early movement in the video game industry was the documentary I didn't know I needed!",True

7,9,I thought it was good,timbennet,n/a,16/08/2025,"I might be a little biased as I am a really big fan of the Mortal Kombat Franchise. Overall I really enjoyed this documentary.

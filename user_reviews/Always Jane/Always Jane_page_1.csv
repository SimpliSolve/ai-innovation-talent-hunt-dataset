1,7,Good but too long,nhermida,n/a,15/08/2025,There are 4 episodes and it could have been done in max 3.Wonderfully supportive family. Rare. So very nice that their support is shown to others who may not understand what the LGBTQ people generally go through.,False
2,6,"An Important Series, Could Have been Shorter",Sil-Azevedo,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the story of a fascinating young woman about to have her confirmation surgery. Along the way came some surprises, which tested Jane's resolve. For some reason the producers decided to stretch this series into four episodes and diluted the impact. Some scenes are repetitive, interviews are drawn out at times, other scenes are not so interesting. My feeling is that there was enough material for two episodes, three max. Still, this is such an important story in our times that I recommend it. We all need to hear Jane's story, which represents so well what so many other teens and their families are going through in America.",False
3,9,Good insight into a transgender woman and her family-minor spoilers,Q-Man,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have to say, that if you start watching, stick with it and watch until the end. As a gay man, I never felt that I had my own "" coming out"" experience, but I think it must be more difficult to come out as trans. Coming out is never easy, and it must be much more difficult to be trans than to be gay.The first two episodes are almost overly cheery. Jane is lucky to have a very supportive family, and, in episodes 1 & 2 it seems like they were always perfectly OK and gender dysphoria was no big deal. It is only in episode 3 that you see that there were, indeed, painful moments for the family and certainly for Jane. Jane had a long journey and was lucky to have her family with her on that journey. The emergence of COVID coincided with the time of Jane's surgery, which made the hospital stay more difficult. Again, the support of her family, even from a distance, helped her through. The Nourys are truly a loving family, including the Grandpa and the dogs.The series is well worth watching and conveys a positive message. Our society would benefit from more understanding of individuals and their differences.",True
4,1,Trash TV,robert-634-396598,n/a,15/08/2025,"I honestly did not care if Jane was trans or not. If this was about a biological female, it would be just as superficial and boring. It felt like the same quality of programming as 16 & Pregnant or any other formulaic MTV style garbage. I watched the first episode in its entirety but I can't imagine wasting my life watching 3 more episodes of this drivel. Hard pass.",False
5,10,A beautifully told story,annie-robert,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a refreshing, positive, and encouraging docuseries about the journey of Jane Noury and her supportive and loving family. Instead of sensationalizing the subject matter and going the traditional ""reality TV"" route, Always Jane is beautifully shot, almost feeling like a movie at times. The intimate peek inside the Nourys' everyday life left me feeling so positive, even through life's more difficult moments. We've all heard the dragged through the mud stories, but we needed stories like this one to be told because they too also exist. We needed to see how an accepting family, even if they don't always have the answers at first, can change the entire experience. These days, we need to support each other - through the small things...all the way to big life-changing decisions. My hope is that Always Jane gives the courage to more teenagers going through difficult situations like Jane Noury to know they are not alone, and to find the strength to preserver. A+ for storytelling and beautiful imagery!",False
6,n/a,"Exploitive Housewives' of NJ style junk, and the three ten star reviews are shilled",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Firstly the three ten star reviews here by supposedly different users reviewers are all use accounts, with a review of this being their sole activity on IMDN. Also using identical phrasing. Hmmmm....Secondly this is simply the overlaying of every cringeworthy trope of ""reality TV: ie obviously 100% scripted pretending to be spontaneous.It is as if this series is setting up strawman that presupposes the parents of a kid who is trans would be deeply dysfunctional. And then knocks down the strawman. What is the point??There isn't an interesting or compelling moment in this series, there is an overwhelming sense of fakeness in every scene. It isn't brave, it is junk3/10.",False
7,1,Exploitive of Trans People,fdmqkhpw,n/a,15/08/2025,"The main character is SO privileged it demeans people not in her socio-economic class, yet in the same situation. Shame on Amazon Prime for calling this a Documentary! What is the point?",False
8,10,Beautiful story about family love and support,henriquegavabarreto,n/a,15/08/2025,"This docuseries shows a great perspective on a transition, focusing not only on one person, but specially on their family members and support. It is amazing to see the power of love, care and compassion in a person's life.Instead of going through the path of controversy and conflict, leading us to think how awful the people in the world can be, the team behind the series show us that love, respect, and happiness still have a place on earth and how better that is for people going through difficult times.It is not hard to find stories in the LGBTQIA+ community of people being phisically or verbally hurt just for them being who they are, sometimes even inside their homes. The Noury's are a good example of what a caring and respectful family can look like.",False
9,10,"Thank you, Jane",darrahblanton,n/a,15/08/2025,"Must see documentary. You will laugh, cry and learn something from this heartwarming and uplifting series. What the worlds needs now. Thank you for sharing your story, Jane and family, can't wait to see what you do next!",False
10,10,"Moving, Positive, Needed",unckles,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary series (not a reality show) really moved me. Things can be so hard for trans people, and I loved seeing how much better they can be in the context of a loving family and supportive group of friends. In particular I love Jane's mom, who is always there for her daughter and who clearly loves her with her whole heart. It's hard to come away from this show not wanting the very best for everyone involved.",False
11,10,Courageous...a must see for everyone,lorianneguajardo,n/a,15/08/2025,"I applaud Jane and her family for sharing their story and opening themselves up to a world which needs to be educated on the transgender community. The docu-series does a phenomenal job the way it was filmed to take you on this difficult journey with the Noury family. It shows all aspects of acceptance, unconditional love and the heartache it takes to get to where the Noury family is today. This film will change lives and help those going thru different stages of their transition. I thank Laura and David, as a parent myself, for their candor and strength to open up to the world. Thank you to Jane, her sisters and friends for their honesty and love. All should be proud of this docuseries and I pray we get to see more of the Noury family!!",False
12,10,Family Over Everything,stephystacks,n/a,15/08/2025,"I absolutely loved this docu-series! To see a family not just standing behind their trans daughter but right there beside her is what the world needs. My favorite part of the series is when her Mom so eloquently says, ""Open your heart and your mind and educate yourself."" If more people would apply those principles to life, we'd be living in a better world. So do yourself an empathetic favor and watch it. It's a beautiful journey.",False
13,10,My best friend was a transwoman so I know that Jane's story is REAL!,edmowrey,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're trying to decide if you want to watch this mini-series, believe the 10/10 reviews. I agreed with every word they say. Then after you watch, let me know.I'm so glad I found the series and watched it. My best friend, Holly, was a trans woman and I walked with her during the difficult post-surgery years. She taught me so much about embracing one's true self, no matter what. That's courage! I'm still working on it. She passed away 6 months ago, aged 73. At her funeral, I sang the chorus from ""Everything Possible"" by Fred Small, the best words I could find to honor my friend: ""You can be anybody you want to be...and know that I will love you still."" Her extended family lover her, and accepted her as Holly even while recalling stories from the years before her transition.I have compassion for transphobic folks who judge and criticize transgendered people--in this case by trashing the film. They are letting their fear win. I suggest they watch the series again, because watching ""Always Jane"" with an open mind is a great insight into the courage it takes to come out as trans. Thank you, Jane, for sharing your story with us!",False
14,10,"Love, love, love it.",skyetoolate,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am only twelve minutes into the first episode and I'm totally in love. The place I grew up had bad attitudes I'm so glad I am not there any longer. I'm a bi guy, I could fall in love with the right person, no matter the gender but being trans must be so much more difficult.I'm so happy to finally live in a world where people can be who they are meant to be.Rock on Jane !",False
15,10,Real Reality TV,crazylegs-98522,n/a,15/08/2025,"Only one episode to have watched so far, but the story being told here is compelling. The big difference in this slice of humanity with so-called reality TV is that the people here seem to be genuine, sharing real experiences, not made up ones. I can't wait for the remaining episodes.",False
16,10,Beautiful story,kathleenjordan42,n/a,15/08/2025,"Always Jane is a beautiful, buoyant, and uplifting story with so much texture... it's inspiring and expertly made. Very bingeable. It's definitely a must watch!",False
17,10,Binge-worthy for sure! A really thoughtful & heartwarming story,kimberlylandry-27822,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved everything about this.We meet Jane during her senior year of high school where she's about 4 years into her transition. From the opening scene, we see how silly, personable and relatable this girl is. Through the series you fall in love with Jane, and amazing her family as they support her on her journey.At the end of the day, she's just a girl trying to live her truth and it's really cool as a viewer to be invited into her world for a few hours.A must-watch for sure.",False
18,10,Almost finished it in one sitting,aschartner,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jane and her family have such a fun dynamic!! This is well edited to be a fun story out of a girl's real life. I look forward to sharing this at my college's lgbt group. We're always looking for real representation, and Jane's story does a good job of that.",False
19,10,Binge Worthy,kathym-47124,n/a,15/08/2025,I couldn't stop watching. After the second episode I didn't want to. Loved it.Director Jonathan C. Hyde managed to steer a verite course without getting into the reality TV territory. He made me love this family.,False
20,10,Honest Story...beautifully told,jenmac-86062,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not only was this story visually beautiful to watch but the content was inspiring. Just a normal family, loving their child. There is nothing more beautiful to witness...great job Noury Family. Bravo!!",False
21,9,"""Open your heart, open your mind and educate yourself""",laserwiz77,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love learning about nouns... you know- persons places and things. That's why I enjoyed this documentary about a young Trans woman, her supportive family and her transitioning process (a.k.a known as her confirmation surgery). Like the grandfather, I've always considered myself to be 'broad minded' about things and this documentary was a well done guide for me to better understand more about this subject. The haters will hate but the compassionate and empathetic will congratulate this young woman and her family. Bravo!",False
22,10,"""Always Jane"" ... Refreshing!!",ianesca,n/a,15/08/2025,"A wonderful piece normalizing a scenario often thought of as abnormal! This series was shot beautifully and honestly. The families love and support of Jane was inspiring. Even though there were challenges in their journey, their love for their child and sibling was unwavering.",False
23,10,Beautiful,music_dragonfly,n/a,15/08/2025,Watched all episodes in one sitting. The world needs to hear more stories like hers. Hope we hear more from Jane and her family in the future. I think they are pretty awesome.,False
24,10,Enlightening,bohemiapat,n/a,15/08/2025,I was so enmeshed in the first episode I watched all and wanted more. Jane is a very brave lady who has so much to look forward to I hope that life is good to her and she continues to have support from family and friends. Life is hard enough and even harder when you are not born into the body of who you know you are.,False
25,9,Uplifting story over a traumatic time,bill-68410,n/a,15/08/2025,"I cannot belive that any family would find one of their members going through trans surgery to be a walk in the park but somehow the Noury's manage to show the emotional maturity and poise that I could only dream of. The documentary definitely has it faults and is perhaps a bit too glib at times but I found Jane's story to be touching and I salute her determination. We were left at the end wondering how she starts to explore her womanhood outside of the drama of school and transitioning. If anything, that is going to be much more difficult - though perhaps hard to believe.Recommend people watch this and see life from a very different perspective to most of us!",False

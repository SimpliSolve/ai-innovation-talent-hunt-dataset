1,7,"A fine glimpse into Sofia Coppola's ""Priscilla""",Rodrigo_Amaro,n/a,16/08/2025,"Short and simple, this making of Sofia Coppola's ""Priscilla"" offers us interviews with the director, the leading star Cailee Spaeny, and
Priscilla Presley, all talking about the story's conception, real life and the recreation of it, intertwined with a tour view on the Graceland set
and the many costumes wore in the film going through several decades as retelling the marriage of Elvis and Priscilla.Most of what's shared relates with the composition of events and composition of characters, the feelings and experiences of each moment and how
ideals were developed; but there's also time to experience the fun and humor from the cast and crew in between takes. Seeing the behind the scenes
covering the period recreation (1950's to 1970's) was amazing, with countless details from the art-direction and props that aren't possible to be
seen in the film as they're hidden in the background or sometimes distant from view, unless if you keep pausing the film. The research done by Sofia
and crew was brilliant.The awkwardness of this short documentary is that leading man Jacob Elordi wasn't given time to share anything about Elvis and how he composed
his version of the rock n'roll star. His moments in the making of are brief moments preparing to film some sequence, often in a good humor. I understand
that the film's point of view relates to Priscilla's point of view of things, her turbulent life next to the king and the film became a massive antithesis
of Baz Luhrmann's colorful and glamourous ""Elvis"" to the point audiences running away from Sofia's film (which is also really great); but to ignore the
male actor felt weird. We understand Elordi is playing a darker and problematic view of a beloved musical/historical figure, but it'd be interesting to see him
talking about his approach on the character, the challenge of performing the musical acts and stuff. Aside to this negligence from the filmmakers (and
the fact the real Priscilla doesn't make any comparisons about her book, the reality and the film), it's a watchable making of. 7/10.",False

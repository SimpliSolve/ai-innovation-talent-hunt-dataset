1,7,a place of history,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Apologies in advance for any improper labels or descriptions included here. This documentary dates back fifty years to when the term ""gay lifestyle"" was acceptable. Further to the point, the focus is on Studio One, a West Hollywood disco for gay men. It took a while for the doors to open for other persuasions in what is now referred to as LGBTQ+. Filmmaker Marc Saltarelli really delivers a history lesson - not just for a landmark building, but for an era when gay men were sometimes arrested for simply walking down the street together.The archival clips and photos often feature sweaty torsos dancing to disco music in a cavernous warehouse located on LaPeer Drive. So why does this particular disco warrant a documentary? Partly because of when it opened (1974), partly for how long it lasted (19 years), and mostly for the people who played and worked within those walls. In 1974, this was one of the few places gay men could hang out together and party. And oh my, did they party! We hear stories from patrons, performers, DJ's, and bartenders ... stories that include feeling safe and free and cutting loose with music, booze, and drugs (etc etc).It wasn't all dancing and gyrating. Studio One became a key force in the Gay Rights Movement, as well as the war against AIDS. Additionally, once the ""Backlot"" was opened upstairs, it developed into a popular performing spot for musicians and comedians, plus as a hangout for celebrities. Boston Optometrist Scott Forbes founded the club, but the building itself had quite a prior history. In 1929 it hosted a movie camera factory, and during WWII it served as a munitions storage facility. In 1967, ""The Factory"" opened as a private club partially owned by actor Paul Newman. It was 1974 when Forbes opened Studio One, setting in motion a cultural shift for southern California.When the film opens, we are informed that a real estate developer has petitioned the city to demolish the building. Those with so many memories of the place work to defend it. Ultimately, a surprising compromise is reached. Along the way, we hear from Chita Rivera, Bruce Vilanch, Liz Torrez, and others as they discuss the impact of this hot spot, and how it evolved into a stage for top performers - including Joan Rivers during her cause to help find a cure for AIDS. It was also a hangout for A-list celebrities like Cary Grant, Rock Hudson, and even Bette Davis.Disco music and discotheques went out of style many years ago, yet the most startling revelation of the film is in the club's own policy of discrimination. When it began, Forbes envisioned this as a place for gay men to experience each other. We even learn his preference was for blond gay men. Not so welcome were people of color, lesbians, or others outside of the preferred demographics. The club (and its owner) was racist and sexist ... quite surprising from a group that society had so severely discriminated against.The history lesson continues with a segment on the filming of CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC at the club, and how Steve Rubell was influenced by Studio One when he founded the infamous Studio 54. The emotions run deep as our talking heads recall those who were lost to the AIDS epidemic, but the smiles are present as they reminisce about the good times. The film provides an unusual look at a specific time in history ... one that shifted society.Available on Digital Platforms beginning January 6, 2025.",False
2,10,Ghosts 10k men speak through this film....,user-16988,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLast night (New Years Eve 2024) I wanted to do something special for my husband, so I ordered from Amazon Prime, a 2023 documentary on Studio One in West Hollywood. He frequented it often, as well as the Probe (where part of American Gigolo with Richard Geer was filmed). That all said, 6 men did the overview, they talked about their experiences working at the club or being a part of it. The admission was like Studio 54 in NYC, where you had to be a celebrity or good looking to enter. Many couldn't get in; my husband said he never had a problem. At the Probe, you had to buy a membership, which he did, and was always admitted as well. So many men frequented Studio One, the purpose of the documentary is the fight to save the club, now torn down, a building which goes back to the silent film era. Although there was a movement to save this piece of Hollywood history, (19) years, it was for naught in the end. Studio One was around much longer than Studio 54 in NYC. Studio One was all gay, Studio 54, was for the most part, a celebrity venue. As the film progressed, they talked about an abandoned garage at a bungalow apartment building in West Hollywood where the owner had died (my husband lived in West Hollywood). They finally cut the locks, and inside were about dozens of boxes of slides. What was on the slides? Photos of Studio One in its heyday from the 1970's to the 1980's, 100's and 100's of images, photos of the dance floors shoulder to shoulder with gay men dancing to disco hits, 90% of which our now dead. This window of history could have easily been lost if not for one historian who was able to obtain and document them. I told my husband, ""I bet you could be seen on some of the slides"" he said, ""yes, as I was there all the time"". Now for the heartbreaking aspect, at the end of the film, the men talked about all the gay men who didn't make it, those who died of AIDS/HIV, 10,000 in West Hollywood alone! Each one would break down in tears, unable to cope, even today, with the losses, friends, some who died within days. The dance floor soon emptied out, whereas, the patrons all died. The men interviewed suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), several even, in therapy for years. I looked over at my husband, who kept wiping tears from his eyes, at one moment, he broke down sobbing. He lost 100 friends in West Hollywood and Palm Springs (where he also lived), the latter, where he would entertain 100 men at a time around the pool, now all gone. When I met him in '93, he too was in therapy for PTSD. He told me one never gets over it.... never! I wanted to share this film with him as I knew it was an overview of the life he led in West Hollywood frequenting Studio One in the 70's and 80's. I was so na√Øve and had no idea it would bring back so many memories and make him so emotional. This all said, there's so much I learned about Studio One and all the men who danced into the night there, I was overwhelmed by the overview. So little is gleaned from my husband who rarely talks about those times.... The men who walked around the now torn-down club are just but a few who survived..... my husband is another. Every gay person in this country, and straights too, should watch this film!",True

1,9,"Engaging, important and surprising!",lisko-00745,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSome documentaries, especially political ones, preach at you. Some are just boring because there's no storyline - just someone pushing their viewpoint and you either agree or you're a monster.
Mighty Ira is different because of it's presentation. We learn the story of the Nazi march in Skokie and why the ACLU supported it. But the kicker is that all parties, in the end, respect the other side and demonstrate that we really can agree to disagree. And more than that, genuine friendships can develop between the most unlikely people. No one is cancelled, no one is disrespected (well, maybe the ACTUAL Nazis).
This is a political movie that REDUCES stress. How rare is that!?",True
2,10,"Timely Past, Present and Future",youngjg-95909,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is a fascinating look at the trouble that can arise from advocating unapologetically for free speech. While those problems come into focus, the documentary makes a clear case as to why those troubles are worth taking on.Ira is a captivating speaker and personality. He is comfortable in his own skin and great at articulating his thoughts clearly, concisely and kindly. We could use more Ira's.The other takeaway that has stuck with me is the importance of sticking up for your beliefs, even when unpopular, while remaining calm and congenial even when those who you are arguing with are not.This is well worth a couple hours of your time!",False
3,10,Very Interesting and Well-Paced,jordanomiller,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a (former) member of the ACLU I was curious to learn about the organization's golden era, which I'm informed took place under the stewardship of Mr. Glasser.
The doc doesn't disappoint--Glasser's life story is fascinating, the historical footage is well used and the defense of the 1st Amendment is perfectly articulated..",False
4,10,What does it mean to fight for civil liberties in America?,zgreenb,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Might Ira"" answers this question definitively-it means fighting for the rights of those you do not agree with. Drawing a line from Nazis in Skokie to white supremacists in Charlottesville, this movie shows its viewers what free speech looks like, and why it is so important that it is vigilantly defended. The arrangement of historical events, sprinkled in between a menagerie of interviews from those across the political spectrum, illustrates how the defenders of civil liberties do their work. It's an inspiring movie for anyone seeking to fight for First Amendment principles, or interested in understanding why this fight must continue to be fought.",False
5,10,Excellent Documentary,jrouse2688,n/a,16/08/2025,"Now, more than ever, advocacy for free speech and the uninhibited exchange of ideas is essential to the maintenance of a free society. Perrino and FIRE do just that with this documentary. 100% recommend this film for spreading the contagious idea that more speech, not less, preserves a free and open society.",False
6,10,A beautiful human story,airbladeorange,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mighty Ira shows how a principled man can make all the difference.Ira Glasser looked a Holocaust survivor in the eyes as he told him he will fight for the right of a Neo-Nazi group to exercise their First Amendment rights. Glasser is a man to admire because he chooses to do what he believes is right in an honest, compassionate, and uncompromising manner.The story, pacing, and cinematography are all well-done. The film does not try to be anything other than it is-a story about a man who believes in the ideals of liberty and navigates his way through a messy world in order to live up to them.",False
7,10,Great movie,theninjashooter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great movie, it raises awareness to something most people don't know, along with teaching us how freedom of speech is for everyone, not just the side you are on.",False
8,10,Wonderful film for Everyone!,thusonculver,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was as entertaining as any I have seen, even if you are not usually a Documentary fan. Getting to know Ira and learning about some of the historical challenges to the First amendment was perhaps even more relevant today than in the 70's. No matter your political inclination, it shows how we can disagree and still have powerful discussions that lead to valuing and supporting the foundations of our democracy.",False
9,10,Powerful Advocacy for Free Speech,aharonschrieber,n/a,16/08/2025,"A wonderful and powerful documentary about the importance of free speech. Not only does the film show how the best way to combat dangerous or hateful speech is with better speech, but it also shows to how to keep humanity even through ideological debate. I particularly appreciated learning about Ira's friendship with Buckley, and the conversations he has with a Skokie resident who survived The Holocaust. The film showed how people can disagree respectfully and still laugh together and enjoy each other's company.Learned a lot not just about one man, but about a way of life and thinking that needs to be reintroduced to our hyper partisan world.",False
10,10,A Feel-Great Film,lenore-51133,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a joy to meet Ira Glasser, the down-to-earth, extremely funny and intensely principled hero of this joyous doc. I'm appalled that I would have known nothing about him without this movie (and my parents lived in Skokie!!!). So glad I got to ""meet"" Mighty Ira through this very warm, inspiring film about free speech, and its importance to the left, right, center -- the very heart of America. Makes me proud!",False
11,10,Worth it!,howardegreenbergesq,n/a,16/08/2025,Timeless story of a First Amendment freedom fighter and the ACLU. Many of the issues are as relevant today as they were in the 1970's. Commendations to Nico Perrino and his colleagues at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) for making this important film.,False
12,10,I'm a high school student and this rocked my world,aminmatariyeh,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a movie everyone should watch and a concept everyone should know. It teaches us about how to lead and what we can do to make a positive effect on our community.,False

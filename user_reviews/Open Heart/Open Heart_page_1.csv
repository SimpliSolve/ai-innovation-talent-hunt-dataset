1,10,King on New York,imperialwalkrnyr,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a diehard New York Rangers & Henrik Lundqvist fan; this documentary exceeded expectations. Beyond being a fantastic look at Hanks career and what he meant to New York - there is such a positive message about perseverance & mental health.To someone who isn't a Rangers fan, the term 'King of New York' may have come as a surprise without a cup. However this documentary exemplifies why Hank earned that title & what he did for Rangers fans & New York as a whole.The journey through his Goaltending career reminded me how much joy, heartbreak & thrills his time encapsulated - growing up with Hank defining what it meant to be a Ranger.Highly recommend to all hockey and sports fans. Seeing that all humans struggle with the same things - & watching Hank face those challenges - leaves you uplifted and inspired.",False

1,8,Great documentary,Chainchain1,n/a,16/08/2025,A well made documentary. It is mainly about Palestine Action but also a lot about different companies in UK and how they support or produce Israeli weapons used in Gaza and West Bank. It was interesting to learn about it and also to get an insight into the group and the history of the group and their actions. They were very detailed about how much damage they have done and how much of Israeli weapons were destroyed which I found interesting. The only negative is that the group was at times quite naive and sometimes it was a hard watch. Their reasoning and arguments were at times a bit off. The group is of course extremist and incites violence so maybe not surprising.,False

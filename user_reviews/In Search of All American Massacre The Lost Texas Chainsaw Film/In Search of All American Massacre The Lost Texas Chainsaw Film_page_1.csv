1,8,Very Cool Underground Doc,brettd-ennis,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary introduced me to and got me invested in the future of a film that I didn't even know was in the making; one that, as it turns out, very few people know was in the making. It's rad that this doc is now a piece of the lore behind this lost film, and will remain connected to its history if we do one day get to see All American Massacre in full.This doc is a gem for horror fans and fans of lost media, made by those very same fans. I think the story told in this documentary appeals to collectors, seekers of the obscure, and those who want the in on the secrets of underground projects. Very cool watch.",True
2,9,Super fun ride!,AshleyUnder,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was really fun! As a fan of the genre, I was always curious to what happened. Edward interviews several people and tracks down various leads as to what could've happened to the footage and it's really fun to go on the journey with them. I don't wanna give any spoilers away, so if you're a fan, you need to see this!To be 100% honest, I'm really hoping that he finds even more out about this movie and the crew/cast that worked on it. I want to see more and I'm hoping that someday, the film itself will actually be completed. A bunch of us would sit down immediately and watch ""all American massacre"" as soon as it premieres. Tell your friends!",False
3,9,So much I didn't know!,aknuckle-60569,n/a,15/08/2025,"For years I considered myself a big TCM guy. Man was I wrong. I had no idea about this sequel until watching this doc. Considering how little the people involved in ""All American Massacre"" were willing to discuss the movie it's a miracle that the doc was even made let alone being as good it is. They were able to fill the spots with film makers and horror icons that help explain the rumors surrounding the movie and it really makes me curious to see what's out there. I now have a new holy grail to add to my list of movies I need to see before I die. I'm a fan of documentaries in general and this one will go on my list of documentaries to recommend for sure. Thoroughly enjoyed. Great work.",False
4,9,Really Interesting to Learn About,kraigkrueger,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a horror fan I feel like I'm pretty knowledgable about the history of the genre, but I was pleasantly surprised when this doc introduced me to an installment of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise that many of us have apparently missed out on.The creators of this documentary obviously put a lot of work into researching this and clearly had a personal connection to the material. The documentary did a great job going over the mystery surrounding this unfinished film, and I really hope the releasing of this doc helps create enough buzz that All American Massacre finally becomes available to the eager masses.",False
5,9,A tale lost to time.,tdmartin-97048,n/a,15/08/2025,"A compelling story about the long lost All American Massacre movie. Bringing attention to it is paramount to hopefully getting the film released. You have many different players who give their opinions and more context to the story itself. The mystery surrounding it is the main draw as one would be curious to why we have never seen this lost Texas chainsaw massacre film. Edward Payson did an excellent job compiling data from a few people involved and even joining in the hunt himself. If you are a fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre this lost film will be of much interest to you and who knows, you may have the film yourself and not even know it!",False

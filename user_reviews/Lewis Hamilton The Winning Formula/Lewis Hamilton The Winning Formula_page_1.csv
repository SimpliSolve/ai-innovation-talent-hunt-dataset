1,6,"""My mindset is the same as it is every year... I want to win.""",Popcorn_Media,n/a,15/08/2025,"There's not a lot of new information in here for anyone who's already following F1 or the World Champion and the few interviewees they have featured in this doc do tend to keep repeating the same lap over and over, but it's still a half decent insight into the life of one of the best British drivers there will ever be.",False
2,2,I bet I'm gonna get hate for writing this comment but...,hackervideogamer,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been Mclaren fan since 2006, so of course I've watched Lewis since he started and I have to say I really don't understand this - Lewis was backed by Ron from a young age (13 I think). Yes he came from a poorer class than the rest of the field, but that's nothing compared to how Checo or Ocon got to where they are now. I get that sometimes he gets racist abuse from a small amount of Max fans but both he, his fanbase and even Mercedes for crying out loud exacerbate all of it by making out he gets death threats. Whereas people who actually have had death threats were Timo Glock after what happened in Brazil 2008 and quite recently Latifi of which those incidents where NONE of their faults.",False
3,9,He's more than just a racing driver.,katieA-42827,n/a,15/08/2025,"An interesting documentary, which while did not contain a lot of new information for avid F1 fans, it was a good watch. The overall rating of this title is not surprising given some individuals personal vendetta's (which is a shame), people need to grow up a bit.",False
4,7,2.5 really ???!!!!! Come on.....,portal1790,n/a,15/08/2025,"In the current Formula 1, in which the results are negotiated between two teams at the expense of regulations, I understand the anger of those who really like motorsports. I was also disillusioned since the negotiation communication was shown in the broadcast to space from all over the world. And I even understand who doesn't like Lewis Hamilton. Personally I think he is one of the most gifted F1 drivers ever. But this documentary should not be seen and classified as a fan or not of Lewis Hamilton. But as a documentary as a whole and as such I don't understand such a low rating in a very interesting documentary. I liked.",False
5,10,Don't listen to the racists and haters,patrick_05,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you enjoy Formula One and are a true fan, be sure to check out this documentary. If you liked the Netflix show, Drive to Survive, also check this one out.",False
6,9,Low rating because of ulterior motives?,sireelknight-42325,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before I watch any show/movie/documentary, I always check IMDB for the rating, and by and large it's served me well. Now, I'm a big fan of motor racing in general and F1 in particular and when I was made aware of this docu I had to give it a try despite the low rating. I'm glad I did because there's NO WAY this show should rank so low. It's well made and paced nicely. It's informant and more importantly, entertaining. Makes me wonder about all the 1 ratings. In a case like this it reeks of overkill for those who dislike Hamilton personally. What Hamilton has achieved is absolutely ground breaking and I can't wait to see what else he can accomplish.",False
7,8,A good documentary,romeshw,n/a,15/08/2025,"Whether you like Lewis Hamilton or not, this is a good, well produced documentary. It's a shame that many people have rated this based on their opinion of the driver rather than whether it is a good film. I'd even hazard to guess that many have even watched it and are holding petty resentmentWhatever your personal views, no one can argue that Lewis is one of the most successful drivers of all time and this is a good exploration of his entry into and his ups and downs in his F1 career. If you're a an F1 fan and can appreciate talent regardless of who you support, you'll enjoy this.I definitely prefer documentaries like this that cover the facts rather than over-produced 'docu' dramas like Drive to Survive.",False
8,10,Great documentary,alpheusmatsebula,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you are a F1 supporter, you will enjoy the documentary. Max and Red bull supporter may choose to skip, but it all about the sport, not personalities.",False
9,10,"Dont trust the rating, just salty haters.",dtgxbbh,n/a,15/08/2025,Sir Lewis Hamilton is the best driver in F1 history. Amazing to see how dedicated to any cause this guy is. What an inspiration and sportsman he is. The salt is just by the haters with 0 knowledge of the sport.Interesting and entertaining documentary. A must see by everyone who loves racing.,False
10,10,Worth watching for any F1 fan,hannes-visagie,n/a,15/08/2025,"Didn't expect the racism and hate to reach into these review scores, but here we are. Nothing really new if you're following F1 or Lewis closely, but still a joy to watch. Some people still think that Lewis is somehow privileged, they have it entirely backwards. He has to fight every prejudice and preconceived subconscious notion of what it meant to be a formula one driver. Everything he had today is the result of consistent decades long effort, determination, and sacrifice.Lewis, like Michael, will probably only be appreciated by his haters long after he retires. But there is some element of race motivated hate that will sadly never go away.",False

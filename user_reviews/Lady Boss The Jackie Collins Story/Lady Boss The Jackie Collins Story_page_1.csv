Greetings again from the darkness. What's it like to grow up in the shadow of a successful older sibling? What if that sibling is the famous actress Joan Collins? Documentarian Laura Fairrie profiles Joan's younger sister, Jackie, who overcame challenges to become one of the few novelists to sell more than 500 million books, with 32 New York Times best-sellers. But Jackie's impact isn't limited to book sales, as her work empowered women in society and in the bedroom.Jackie wasn't always known for her big hair and leopard prints and risqué writing. In fact, she wasn't known at all before she visited Los Angeles for the first time in 1956, during which she was referred to as Joan's little sister. Ms. Fairrie spends some time with Jackie's childhood and family life, and then takes us through both of her marriages, the career, and her illness. Much of the source work is provided from Jackie's lifelong habit of writing in her diaries, and although much of what is read doesn't dig too deeply into Jackie's psyche, we do get the gist of her focus on observing people and turning those observations into stories that millions loved to read.In addition to the diaries, there are interviews with Jackie's daughters, her brother, her long time literary agent, her business manager, her personal assistant, and her sister Joan. Some of her (""best"") friends also offer insight, including Barbara Davis, widow of oil man and former owner of 20th Century Fox, Marvin Davis. Some segments feature these folks reading passages directly from Jackie's books, but it's their personal recollections that come closest to adding substance.Therein lies the biggest hurdle with the film. It succeeds in tracking Jackie's rise to the top as an author, but it doesn't go deep enough into her books' influence on society, and we get even less about Jackie's personal makeup. She was a woman succeeding in a man's world, and she carefully crafted and cultivated a public image that included plastic surgery, so that what they read is what they see. One of her daughters states there were ""two sides to this mom"", but even that doesn't result in the breakthrough we hope for.Husband number 2, Oscar Lerman, encouraged Jackie to write her first book, ""The World is Full of Married Men"", and that was the start of an incredible writing career. Sister Joan's interviews are in line with the rest of the film in never going too deep, but she does make the comparison of ""a marriage"" to her relationship with Jackie, and maybe the best insight is the difference in how Joan describes their father to how Jackie's diary entries do. By assembling the bits and pieces we do understand Jackie had significant insecurities behind her public façade.Clearly there were times a sisterly rivalry was in play, and that's somewhat offset by the fact that Joan starred in two movies based on books written by sister Jackie (""The Stud"" and ""The Bitch""). In the 1980's Joan's career got a huge boost playing Alexis in ""Dynasty"", while at the same time, Jackie was enjoying the success of one of her biggest sellers, ""Hollywood Wives"". As a ground-breaking author, Jackie Collins deserves this documentary profile, and towards the conclusion, there is a segment where she faces a live audience in a televised talk show sometime in the 1990's. The audience is vicious in their attacks on Jackie's writing, but she remains strong in the face of adversity ... a trait that was every bit as important as her book sales.The film had its World Premiere at Tribeca Film Festival and will air on CNN Films in late June and on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer later this year.",False
2,7,Lady Boss: The Jackie Collins Story,Prismark10,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jackie Collins was destined to live under the shadows of her old sister Joan Collins.While Jackie did not make it as an actress despite plastic surgery. She made it as a writer. Even as a kid in the late 1970s I was aware of her through the film adaptation of books such as The Stud (starring Joan) and the The World is full of married men.The movies were soft core mainly because her books were full of sex. Jackie Collins was never going to rival Graham Greene but she knew how to spin a yarn and fill it with the sexual exploits of the bronze and the beautiful.This was a warts and all documentary showing footage that Jackie shot over the years. There was sibling rivalry, domineering men. Jackie's and Joan's father certainly ruled the roost in his household.Despite appearing to be a strong woman. Promoting female empowerment in her books. Jackie married two unsuitable men. Only her second husband, a nightclub owner showered her with love and even moved to America in the 1980s as Jackie wanted to have a serious crack at America as a writer.This was surprisingly in depth and mischievous. It helps that family members appear to be candid and that includes Joan.Jackie Collins sold a lot of thrashy books in the 1980s. By the 90s that type of books were saturating the market by others, including Joan.There is a clip from the British discussion show Kilroy where both men and women slate her books. Still Jackie persevered, she was a tough woman and knew how to sell her books.Even close to death she made one final visit to Britain to see old friends and family. She even made a few promotional appearances on television.",False
3,8,Loved it!,Analog_Devotee,n/a,16/08/2025,Documentaries about writers are a big soft spot for me and this one was fantastic. Can't believe I've never heard of this woman! Definitely ahead of her time; I'll be seeking out some of her novels soon.,False
4,6,She WAS a powerhouse,kellyq12,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a fan of Jackie Collins' writing style (the actual prose - not critiquing the stories themselves because I don't read the stories due to not caring for the writing itself) BUT, BUT I'm a fan of who she was - a bold trailblazer who wrote the stories she wanted to write! You have to respect that whether you personally like her writing or not.The documentary was interesting but it didn't do a good job of anchoring events to the timeline. It jumps around a lot so you may find yourself looking up info online to better understand the chronology (I did). I also thought it was weird that early on the filmmakers made it seem like it was going to be a story about a woman who was so brave, bold, confident, and sexy in the public eye, but behind closed doors, they were going to show she was so broken and so different than the public image. Oh, the scandal! Except there was no scandal. Jackie Collins was human, which is to say she endured some tragedy and loss and had some insecurities and doubts. Like all humans do. But to accomplish what she did time and time again shows she WAS a brave, bold, confident, and sexy woman. It was like the filmmakers wanted to undercut that somehow by implying that she was a mess behind the scenes. I didn't see a mess. I saw a complex human. Hats off to Jackie Collins, the legend AND the woman.PS. Jackie was also VERY pretty, both before & after plastic surgery. Her grumpy, rude ""friend"" who kept saying things like how Jackie had a lot things to ""fix"" sounded like a very sad, sour grapes person. Definitely not a true friend. More like a jealous frenemy who wished she'd been as cool as Jackie.",False
5,6,Sound mixing was TERRIBLE!,garfarkle-83769,n/a,16/08/2025,"The dialog and background music were often at the same level making the dialog very hard to hear for an old person (yes, I had my hearing aids in). Background music should be in the background, not in the foreground. Other than than that complaint, the show was good.",False
6,8,The Storyteller,Dragonborn64,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very good, if unoriginal documentary of a fascinating woman who for a writer had movie star celebrity. If she was riddled with secrets and anxieties, beyond the usual stuff, it didn't seem so. She was lucky to have a very supportive husband and a very good work ethic. I don't know if her novels were groundbreaking or helped women as so many claim but her easy to read, sexy books were obviously loved by millions. She seemed like a decent soul, much more real than her sister who always seems ""on"". And seeing her out selling books on talk shows a week before she died, so thin, did make me realize she was a champion.",False
7,5,Badly edited,jakethesnake-42007,n/a,16/08/2025,What can I say about this documentary hmm cheaply made I think that's the right thing. I loved Jackie Collins and still remember where I was when I found out she died. I remember when I started reading chances and got hooked on it and her books. I was excited to watch this documentary and what a let down it was. It was poorly directed and edited. It seemed it was done on a Poor budget. The way it was edited really annoyed me. It could of been done so much better. It's better then nothing but still it was a big disappointment.,False
8,5,Confession,wisewebwoman,n/a,16/08/2025,"I only ever read one of her books. Out of curiosity to see what all the fuss was about. I was NOT impressed and I am no prude. She wrote that particular book from the male sexual side of things which was a huge disappointment. I suppose it was ground-breaking she was writing so graphically and having independent women as her heroes.My curiosity in watching this was in the sibling relationship she had with her sister and their origins. A famously beautiful sister and the comparatively plain (quite attractive actually) writer who invests in plastic surgery to make herself prettier.Interesting when the tables are turned after many years and she becomes more famous than Joan.Interviews are fairly flat apart from those with Joan. Her daughters are candid on her subsequent marriage after the ""love of her life"" Oscar dies.Her perfectly crafted persona was a sham, but then again that is nothing new for performers of any kind.5/5 I'd like to see a film about the sisters. Their father sounds like a monster.",False

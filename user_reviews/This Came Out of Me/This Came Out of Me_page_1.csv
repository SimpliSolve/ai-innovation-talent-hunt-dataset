1,10,Very Informative,kat-10065,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a now disabled medical professional, I really enjoy this show! Be prepared for a few moments that might be a bit much for the squeamish, but there is a lot to learn from this show!",False
2,5,No blurring please!,windsorenquirer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very interesting show and I would give it 10 stars but this ""blurring"" is very annoying and unnecessary. It only happens in American reality tv shows. If it's a British show... there's not blurring ever. If you don't want to show some parts of the human body then don't include such cases or just blur the faces of the patients so their privacy is protected.",False
3,3,Censorship kinda ruins this show,spawnreaper,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love medical shows. I watched ""bizar ER"" on bbc that was very well done. This show has the same setup with a big difference. The American censorship blurs a lot. So they don't show the exact thing they are working on if it's near any private parts or butt's. It's an interesting show, but less so the Bizar ER.",False

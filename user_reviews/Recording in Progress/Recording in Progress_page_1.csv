1,3,Spot the Dog goes to the recording studio,davewenborn,n/a,15/08/2025,"Synopsis, here's a grocery store, they sell groceries, lets have everyone tell us how they like going to the grocery store. Lets look around the grocery store and have people who work there tell us how they like working there...repeat ad nauseum.Its like a film about dentistry you see in the waiting room of a dentist.If you want to see and hear proper information, youtube all the famous recording studios, they'll give you the run down.",False
2,8,Recording Studio Doc for Music Lovers!,cdwelcome-51-56444,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love this film on so many levels. I am biased as a musician who has recorded in many studios and has seen the changes over the last several decades. One of the wonderful things about this film is how much the people being documented love what they do. Kudos to the director, and I am certain many music professionals will enjoy this.",False
3,10,An amazing effort for a first time filmmaker,Karl_Withakay,n/a,15/08/2025,"One thing I really like about this film, whereas a lot of documentaries will filter and edit the material to guide you towards the filmmaker's opinions and conclusions, Recording in Progress provides a spectrum of viewpoints about the recording industry and recording studios and lets you form your own conclusions and opinions.You can enjoy this film even if you have no knowledge of or particular interest in the recording industry.",False

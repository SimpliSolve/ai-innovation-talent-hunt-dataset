1,8,A spoiled person,paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thanks (in part to many documentaties), the world now knows the full truth about child-absuer Jeffrey Epstein and his enabler Ghislaine Maxwell, who has ended up taking the legal rap following the suicide of her partner in crime. But this one is still worth watching, as many people who knew Maxwell speak, quite frankly, about their association with her, and it is quite revealling: what comes across is how, even before her father died (and was subsequently revealed as a fraudster), Maxwell delighted in using her sexual and financial power as a social weapon. Her youthful behaviours provide insight into how she later became Epstein's procurer-in-chief. Someone who knew her as a child says she was ""spoilt"" by her monstrous father, but the spelling ""spoiled"" feels more appropriate. In general, I don't favour punitive justice, but it's clear she was not a passive victim, but motivated by her sense of self-satisfaction at keeping Epstein serviced and herself in the position she had always been accumstomed to. Incredibly, she is still denying her guilt and she appeals against her conviction.",False
2,7,Maxwell Louse,Lejink,n/a,15/08/2025,"Maybe I have a slightly ghoulish interest in the abuse and trafficking cases brought against high and mighty individuals Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew but I also feel angry that they entrapped usually young people into their sordid world and generally act as if personal power, fortune and privilege isn't enough for them but that they also have to have other people do their bidding even down to participating in disgusting and depraved sexual acts.This three-part documentary focused on Ghislaine Maxwell but naturally took in her ill-fated relationships with the two others mentioned above. The programme started by retracing her origins as the daughter of the wealthy press magnate Robert Maxwell, where we learned that as the youngest of his many children, she was his favourite as evidenced not only by the many pictures of them together but also by his naming of his private luxury yacht after her, which turned out to be the one from which he probably committed suicide.Only in her early twenties at this point, Maxwell reinvented herself by moving to New York and working in magazines through which she began to socialise with the high and mighty there. This is how her path crossed with Epstein and she quickly became his lover and partner. Epstein was a fabulously wealthy investor who hob-nobbed with the rich and famous, including ex-President Clinton, future President Trump and of course most infamously Prince Andrew of the British royal family. He even owned his own private island in the Caribbean which he treated as his own playground, although the games he would play were very dark and very sinister involving as they did the procurement of very young girls allegedly in-gathered for him by Maxwell, to enable Epstein to meet his self-proclaimed target of three orgasms per day. So it was that girls as young as 14 and usually always in their early teens were brought to the island ostensibly to massage Epstein but in reality to be sexually assaulted by him.Justice finally caught up with Epstein when at the second attempt in 2019 he was arrested and while awaiting trial for his deviancy, committed suicide in his prison cell. But if Maxwell thought it would all go away for her with Epstein's death she was wrong as the same accusers now pointed the finger at her as his procurer and occasional participant in some of the dreadful practices against them. Maxwell's defence was that she didn't know anything about his activities but from the evidence and testimony presented here, it was no surprise to me when in late 2021 in New York she was convicted and sentenced to over 20 years in prison, a decision which she is currently in course of appealing.With very few exceptions, almost everyone here presented in front of the camera seemed to find it completely plausible that she knew exactly what she was doing in Epstein's service.Of course some of the big fish appear to have got away as witness Prince Andrew's recent settlement with his main accuser Virginia Giuffre, but for me there is satisfaction in knowing that at least Epstein and Maxwell's huge wealth and power in the end weren't able to protect them from the ends of justice.This documentary made no secret about which side it took in this matter but even so seemed to me to do a good job in building up the case against this duplicitous and ultimately totally discredited individual. Perhaps if her blood had been blue she too might have found a way out of her predicament but in the end, I was encouraged to see all the victims interviewed here getting some sort of satisfaction and I hope closure from her likely lengthy incarceration in jail.",False
3,3,What? No List?,PartialMovieViewer,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI really don't care about this person, but there is a list of rich and powerful that needs verifiable exposure. Interesting documentary about a privileged co-abuser of children; delivered in a softball manner. Don't get me wrong, the documentary is not this non-stop cheer-a-thon, but there was a side to this show almost wanting to excuse a disgusting predator. Maybe that's a bit harsh, but the film's creators seemed to want to lay the entire blame on Epstein. Don't get me wrong, Jeffery Epstein is a monster carelessly destroying children at every chance. 'Every chance', how were those orchestrated? It sure seems like Ghislaine held that batton. What a horrible piece of filth. Anyways, not horrible, but we need to see the list - who of these holier-than-thou sex-guests actually are? Ruin their job? Not as bad as destroying children.",True
4,9,Successful documentary about a serial abuser,dakjets,n/a,15/08/2025,"At the same time as Ghislane Maxwell's trial, this three-episode documentary about her came out. I, like many others, have asked myself how a woman like her could become involved in such grotesque and serious crimes. Her society background, famous father and family relationships have been widely discussed. In this documentary, however, more extensive background material is given about this woman in the first episode of the series. For a documentary to be good for me, it must provide insight and learning. The creators succeed here in that a large proportion of Maxwell's circle contributes information. It provides insight, but of course no complete answers as to how she ended up the way she did.Later in the series, we follow her life after meeting Jeffrey Epstein. This episode gives an undisguised insight into how abusers think and process their victims. Here, many of their victims come forward and talk with horror about the stress they were subjected to and the abuse the couple subjected them to. The documentary highlights the victims' stories and an eerie picture of wealthy people who had no respect for other people in their sick need to satisfy their needs. The documentary also shows that even people who believe they are above the law and judgement, are also caught and prosecuted for their abuses. After watching this series I sit back wiser, but still incomprehensible to understand the evil and sadism behind her actions.",False
5,2,Fairly bad.,NullUnit,n/a,15/08/2025,Simply boring and uninformative overall.More information can be gleaned from a simple internet search and 20 minutes of reading.... no need to sit through 3 hrs of this...,False
6,9,DISGUSTING EPSTEIN & MAXWELL get the CHOP !,lyninbyron,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hooray, Epstein is dead and Maxwell will rot in jail where she belongs!Maxwell grew up with an abusive father and she became an high and mighty, gold digging, self entitled abuser herself! Epstein, did he commit suicide or was he murdered? If he had cameras in every room of his home, then that would explain why he got such a light sentence the first time around. I'm thinking he had thousands of hours of video tape on the comings and going's of the filthy, deviant, child raping elite men and the log book was kept, with names, dates and times to make it easy to review tapes and compile an insurance policy.With all the high society child rapists attending The Epstein house and island, I can only imagine that these same people managed to orchestrate a short sentence for Epstein, who would have threatened to publish the damning evidence.My big question is, why didn't the FBI initially lay charges 26 years beforehand? Who was the guy that said bury that child's statement and move on. I'd also like to know why Trump, prince Andrew, and all the other high profile people weren't implicated and questioned.It seems the FBI can't find its bum with both hands! Useless! The shows producers should have asked the FBI
to ""please explain ?""There is a whole lot more to this story!",False

1,7,"Nice slice of life documentary of a dying mall, but could use more context.",charcas67,n/a,15/08/2025,"All in all I enjoyed this documentary about a dying mall in Jasper Alabama. The film offers a cross section of people who work there and shop there as well as efforts (generally not successful) to increase foot traffic. I just wished occasionally the film makers had pulled away from the mall setting to give us some context about the larger community where the mall is set. Sure, internet commerce has hurt malls across the country, but are there shopping areas in Jasper that are prospering, such as downtown or the area where the jewelry repair shop moved to? Or is Jasper overall an economically depressed area that has gone severely down hill since the hey day of Jasper Mall in the 80s and 90s? The film would have been a much more rewarding experience for me if such contextual interludes had been provided.",False
2,7,Equal parts nostalgic comfort and dystopian apathy,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,n/a,15/08/2025,"The epitome of a slice-of-life documentary! Jasper Mall offers such straightforward Middle America vibes that anyone who's never left the big city they grew up in might find this pretty alien. It's so low key, so go-with-the-flow, so ""real time"" feeling that it manages a dreamlike quality. Of course, the dreamlike pace also comes from the disciplined editing, the reflective ambient score, and the beautiful photography. There is an endearing quality to this doc, but also an underlying melancholy all the way through.I think the average person would think ""nothing happens in this movie"", but that's beside the point. What it comes down to is: I never thought I would see malls become a thing of the past in my entire lifetime. Now, suddenly, we're here, and slowly, one by one, they're gonna start shutting down. What's the primary reason for this? Amazon, of course. Where did I watch this movie? On Amazon (Prime Video) - how meta is that?The fact that this was shot in 2019, the year before the pandemic hit, also adds another element of surrealism to the viewing experience. It's almost like a precursor to the vacant vibes we were about to face. It makes you wonder - is the pandemic really expediting the obsoletion of so many things that we've been accustomed to our whole lives, as much as we think it is? Or, would most of this be happening soon any way?In the end, I don't think you will walk away from Jasper Mall remembering many of the specific scenes for the rest of your life, maybe none of them at all, but it's an equally comforting and eerie thing to watch in our current state (nearly one year into the COVID-19 pandemic). It floats in this strange limbo between nostalgic warmth and dystopian apathy. It's a tasteful doc - subtle but with great purpose.",False
3,8,"Funny, touching, sad and important.",celestialrob,n/a,15/08/2025,"My son and I fell like we were watching a car wreck in slow motion. A group of lovely people caught up in an inevitable economic tragedy that is coming their way. The cinematography and editing is very well done. Admittedly, this is a minor film, but worth every one of the 86 minutes you'll spend watching.",False
4,7,Uniquely sad and simple,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,15/08/2025,"If I live to be in my 80s, I'm probably going to become that old dude telling corny jokes at the mall, except I'll be reciting old memes from the 2010s.That young couple at the fair were pretty adorable. Even though I don't know them personally, I hope they're still together.I also liked those old dudes playing dominoes in the mall. Kinda looks like a fun time by elderly people standards tbh.I wish I could believe in heaven as easily as that guy in the motorised wheelchair near the beginning.This is the kind of thing I might've found really boring if I was in a different mood, but I quite liked it. No logical reason why I dug something like this but hated the much-loved Grey Gardens, for example, which Jasper Mall is a little reminiscent of, in some ways.It achieved and sustained an odd sense of melancholy that was quite unique; never depressing exactly, and not necessarily nostalgic, but never quite happy, either.As a result, it was one-note (likely by design) and a little repetitive, but I have a feeling it could stick with me for a while, thanks to the quiet but admittedly unique emotions it made me feel while I watched it.",False
5,7,Dying world,BoynamedAndrew,n/a,15/08/2025,"I remember when I was young always being at the mall. Whether it was just hanging out or hitting the food court, it was the place to go in a small town. The traditional mall is a dying world and this documentary captures one example of this. Great film, it's a must watch.",False
6,8,"A nostalgic, heartwarming, and equally heart-breaking documentary",MinistryofDoom,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jasper Mall was an entertaining look into the life of a mall. It's both heartwarming and tragic. As a child of the 80s, I spent much of my adolescence in malls like Jasper Mall making friends, hanging out in the food courts and the arcades, and just spending time there. So when I began watching this documentary, it brought me back to a time and place in my youth who's memory put a big smile on my face. At the same time, I was saddened and heartbroken by the fact that these places are disappearing. They weren't just places for shopping. Malls were where you met your first love, where you went on your first date, where you met your best friends, where you made so many memories, and they're going away because American culture has changed. Jasper Mall is a time capsule for the future, where one day we will look back and say ""remember when we used to go to the mall?"" It's a both a story of a mall as a physical entity but also as a reference point in the lives of all these invdividuals and their personal stories, from the Zookeeper turnded security and custodian, to Robin the retiring florist, and young starry-eyed interracial couple, the old men playing dominos, the tattooed hair stylist who wants to escape Jasper to do great things in her life. They all have personal stories and they're all part of the life and times of Jasper Mall.",False
7,7,Let's talk shop! Although this movie did capture somewhat of a year in the life of a dying mall with its patrons & employees. It's still not quite an informative watch.,ironhorse_iv,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerUnlike the semi popular 'Dead Mall' series from the likes of Bright Sun Films and others YouTube Channels that goes into great detail the history of the titular shopping centers from its humble beginnings to its painful demise. This documentary directed by Bradford Thomason and Brett Whitcomb didn't really give much of any educational, scientific or historical value for the audience to look over. The documentary doesn't show much of any of the staff talking about the negative impact that online shopping has done to the mall nor was there any information about why their two anchors stores K-Mart and JC Penney left before the movie started. The filmmakers don't even give key data like where this mall is even located. It would had been nice to know that one of the reasons why the mall in Jasper, Alabama is having trouble keeping afloat is the fact that it's located on US 78 North, far away enough from big cities like Birmingham and even further east from its prime city. Furthermore, one of the main causes that the shopping center get overlooked is because after the completion of interstate 1-22. It moves much of the major traffic away from the mall. To add onto the mess, the shopping center itself sits in a predominately rural mountainous forest area with barely any locals due to the location's violent tornado patterns and borderline economic poverty problems. Another thing that the film doesn't point out is how many times, the mall went through foreclosure and who currently owns it. I assuming that Kohan Retail Investment Group still own the property, but who knows. None of these questions were answer or explained in this documentary. Truth be hold; the filmmakers only gave the viewer a few glimpses that something was a bit off about the Jasper mall. Such examples are the amazing analogically-like footage where mostly elderly customers order funeral flowers, play dominos in an empty food court, sing contradicting gospel music and unable to connect with modern technology. It really does symbolic representative, this dying mall's detachment with the more common younger online driven patrons. The absence of youth culture throughout the film is really alarming; seeing how in the 1980s & 1990s, malls would be the ultimate hangout spot for children, while older people were more interested in local ma & pa's downtown stores. The roles had changed here and it's somewhat surreal. Instead of expanding those key moments a little more to fit the overall narrative of the shopping center creeping closer to its own demise. The movie took a sharp right turn into focusing on nearly unrelated issues. One such example is the filmmaker's request in telling a teen couple's story about the struggles of starting an interracial relationship in the deep south. While their tale was somewhat interesting. Race relations doesn't really connect with the overall mall narrative at all. There weren't any signs of the shopping center being chauvinistic. If there were some underlying racism, the film didn't show it. After all the mall was alright with having children of minorities sit on Santa Claus' lap. Added to that, the couple are not really employees nor persistent shoppers at the mall. They really looked out of place. A good example of this was their appearance in the food court toward the end of the film. That moment felt awkwardly staged reenactment as they look like they secretly have no clue why they agreed to meet there rather than at home texting. It's seemed out of character for them to interact at that location. To tell you the truth, the movie would have work better if the filmmakers focus more on the life of the teenager custodian. As his story relates to what's going on with the mall. Sadly, that subplot was abandoned. Another story that seems to go nowhere was the nail saloon lady. We never did find out if she left her job and travel the world. Maybe the movie should have focus on that, rather than wasting film footage on the manager/security guard's Mike McClelland romanticizing his past job as a Tiger King type zookeeper. While this was never uttered in the film. The mall does love to host Jungle Safaris events even after they been cited numerous times by the USDA. The reasons why are because it didn't meet minimum federal standards for the care of animals in captivity that was established by the Animal Welfare Act. Because of that and other controversial events like selling hand held weapons in order to increase foot traffic. The mall is viewed as being notorious passe than modern. You can tell by the look of the shopping center. The mall had not been remodeled since it opened in 1981. The lack of people around with the incandescent lighting makes the antique layout of the location look really haunting. There are long shots where the camera lingers on shots of the empty location with nothing really going on. While some people might think of that as boring. I kinda like the petrifying nostalgia feel, those visuals give. It's surprising more riveting than watching highly staged moments where people ruin shots by staring straight at the camera as they talk to other people. That was annoying because it ruins the illusion of observation that the movie was trying to build. Nevertheless, the music that went along with the film was well used. The collection of songs by the musicians HAHA Mart, Chayse Porter and Baker Knight were easy on the ears. Overall: to close shop. This documentary is not quite good enough to be putting on your shopping list. It's only good for a quick browse.",True
8,10,Unexpectedly moving,kmaloupe,n/a,15/08/2025,"The filming and editing of this documentary stood out. I felt like I really new the people and their stories. Jasper is really a unique town, and I hope this film brings people together to make a difference, and try to get Jasper Mall back to its former glory.",False
9,7,Worth watching,name99-92-545389,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'll be the first to admit that, in some sense, you're not going to learn anything from this that you didn't already know. Even so, I think it's worth watching to be reminded of how the other America, flyover America, may not be exactly what you think it is.A cruel or stupid person can find a lot to mock here, but what I saw was whole lot of people trying to be decent under difficult circumstances. In particular the combination janitor/security guard comes across as a real hero, battling on so many fronts to keep the place viable, doing a job that seems way above his pay grade.It's inevitable that anyone seeing this is going to veer off into their own analysis: why's it happening (my theory of economics), what should be done (my theory of politics), why are people responding as they are (my theory of culture).
But there's value, at least occasionally, in switching off your theory of the world and just observing the situation, acquiring some new raw data and perhaps even, god forbid, modifying your theories of economics/politics/culture in response to that data.",False
10,5,Emotional,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA lot of the YouTube videos that Becca and I watch are either trips to dead malls or videos of the past glories of malls. We were excited to see Jasper Mall, which is the story of one year in the life of one of those former shopping destinations and while it starts strong, it seems to hang on way too long, which is...well, a lot like a dead mall.Directed by Bradford Thomason and Brett Whitcomb (who worked together on GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling and The Rock-afire Explosion), I do have to say that I enjoyed a lot of the people within the film, like Mike McClelland, the custodian of the mall who was once a zookeeper. Also, I have no idea what accent Mike has, which sounds British at times, Southern others and then by the end, it comes and goes. It's baffling!I really wish this movie was about twenty minutes or so shorter. There are some magical moments here, like the Jewelry Doctor rocking out before he closes his store and the camaraderie of the old men that play dominoes.Jasper Mall is still open, amazingly, after watching this film. I can't say the same for places like the Towne Mall - yes, I realize there are a few shops still there - or Century 3. There was a time when my entire non-school existence was spent at the mall, buying music and movies, seeing the latest releases and expanding my pop culture knowledge at Waldenbooks. This movie brings back those feelings and more. It's not perfect, but there's some heart here.",True
11,9,A touching documentary.,lisajdeloach,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie was so unexpected to me. I kept rooting for the store managers that have put their lives into their business. A few key retail places moved so the whole mall is dying. It is a touching story of the mall manager, who used to keep wildlife in Australia, to the older white men who like to play dominoes at the mall. It is a clip, a small view into what makes our communities work. It is worth watching..make some popcorn and watch the Jasper Mall.",False
12,7,Was craving a little more context,robertkdb,n/a,15/08/2025,"Cinematography, editing and musical score were on point.
I found myself wanting to know a little more about things.
Kudos to the filmmakers.",False
13,5,Sweet but needs historical context,dutchie-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"I enjoyed this doc and its showcase on a dying mall, many of which are in the same sad state across the country. The cinematography was perhaps the best aspect of the film, and they use it in the place of narration often and brilliantly.I would've appreciated a more linear perspective that also showcased clips and videos of the mall in its prime, instead of the brief scene of one of the tenants flipping through a photo album of news clippings that are hard for the audience to even see.Accordingly, I felt the overall story didn't serve those we see on screen in present day. Someone who is young and never experienced mall culture when it was at it's height in the 80s and early 90s would be completely bored by this film since it lacks all context from the past.",False
14,6,Something special,ks-60500,n/a,15/08/2025,I think it's a documentary but it looks like a movie. It's quite unusual for this production and kinda warm feeling for people inside the mall.,False
15,6,The slow death of shopping malls,stylss,n/a,15/08/2025,"Simple, nostalgic, touching, and sad look at the slow death of shopping malls, specifically Jasper Mall in Jasper, Alabama.Kinda wild to watch this on Amazon Prime Video considering how Amazon is one of the primary contributors to their death.",False
16,10,Low frills documentary,milesjohnson-45855,n/a,15/08/2025,"Documentaries like ""Jasper Mall"" are why I initially started getting into watching docs. No voiceovers, no thematic soundtrack, just pure cinematography and story telling. This doc creates heroes and people you want to root for just by showing their day to day lives. For someone who grew up with their local mall being their ""go to place"" as a youth, this brought back both memories and sad realizations. The Jasper Mall has its glory days in the 90s and early 2000s, and many of the people who work there now were around for those days. There is held out hope that somehow with the right store, department, or entertainment, the glory days will come back.
This doc is admirable, sad, and hopeful. The director did a great job in letting the story play out, accompanied by savvy camera work. Half way through I found my self wanting to take a road trip down to this mall just to purchase things from the people showcased. There is something simple and poetic about the plight of middle class America, and this puts it into portrait form. I know that several malls across America are experiencing their own ""Jasper"" reality, but the key to a great doc is getting the audience to care about the subjects. That being said, goal achieved.
Anyone wanting a stirring and nostalgic trip down memory lane that becomes a real slightly sad real world story, this is a perfect doc. Don't waste your time on Tiger King, this is real America.",False
17,6,Great documentary about slow people,jamesiha3,n/a,15/08/2025,"Documentary was well made but not much content to be had in the Jasper Mall. They highlighted that the most action they get are from homeless (druggies) looking for shelter, old people looking for a place to walk, and old men playing dominos in the food court. When the security/maintenance/sales rep called for more food businesses, he said he needed it because the tenants wanted a place to eat. The tenants, not the mall shoppers, or mall walkers, or mall dominoes. That makes no sense as a business. They need stores that can't be replaced with online sales, like clothing stores (for the ladies) or appliance and technology stores (for the guys). And it has to be high end, because people who have money spend it all the time. People who shop at JCPenney aren't buying new clothes all the time, it's once or twice a year. People who are buying Gucci are buying constantly to keep up with the trends. But people in Jasper, or within 300 miles of Jasper, aren't buying from Gucci. So the malls will fail, and the mom & pops will make a resurgence as stand alone establishment's. Leave Gucci and mall settings for the big city's, because there is no middle class anymore to buy at the suburban malls. The only thing they're good for is pooping on the floor on video and posting it to Tik-Tok.",False
18,8,Sad but poignant.,harryokin,n/a,15/08/2025,"A very sad but poignant documentary about a dying mall in Alabama. It captures the struggle of everyday life brilliantly and without narration, but there is always hope tucked away if you look.",False
19,7,Mall documentary or Reality show?,deedee0,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film had potential but blew it. We were expecting a documentary on the current state of malls in the US. Instead we saw a film on the life of a mall over a year which is not what the Amazon description stated. Surprisingly we really enjoyed the film except when it strayed too far into the reality show world with the random hair dresser, Santa, and teenage couple. The scenes of the crying girl on the carousel, Santa getting dressed, and desperate teen begging her ex to call her with promises of money were completely unrelated to the topic, creepy, and cringeworthy. The film really shined when it stuck to following the mall and store owners.",False
20,3,A cruel and unkind documentary.,jonathanowen-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a cruel documentary. It's like watching something die.It's not bold or brave. It's not interesting. It says nothing. It's just...inevitable.And then it puts the camera in its face as it gasps its last few breaths. It knows the sadness of what it's looking at and doesn't look away. It can't help itself. Like the little girl on the carousel screaming in fear and whose mom keeps telling her she's okay. Or the two large women vibrating in massage chairs. What does this image communicate?There's no compassion. There's no love for the subject.It's hard to care about these people we are seeing when the camera is always quick to put their dying small town America front and center.Keats said, ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty,-that is all
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."" This documentary is all truth and no beauty.",False
21,10,GREAT DOCUMENTARY GORGEOUS FILM,stcygrl-67142,n/a,15/08/2025,"Amazing documentary about a mall built in the 80s and the state of the mall today. So interesting! And it brought back so many memories. But what I love about this film is how it captures the human aspect of the mall and how it's future will affect its occupants. The cinematography is brilliant. It captures the moments and then some. Leaves you thinking about your mall days! Being 58 myself, this captured so many memories of my days hanging out at the mall. I've watched it twice so far and am just so mesmerized at how the camera captures the moments!",False
22,6,"Melancholic, bittersweet realistic observational cinema",JustHavingALook,n/a,15/08/2025,"What I find impressive about this production is that they could convince real people to be so open about their life in front of a camera.It's the main strength but also the main weakness.Reasons:You don't get to know any of them well enough to actually care about what they are up to.Sure, we follow the main caretaker during this year, we know his past and his values, but it's dispersed in an ocean of people, hence watered it down.No goals, no conflicts, no stakes are presented. Yes, it seems the mall is going to be shut down. So what? What does that mean for them?There's a scene where a store owner is set to relocate...that looked promising but it went nowhere.Yes, there are deep emotions on display but unfortunately there's no story to follow.Photography is well done; the soundtracks were picked intelligently; the pacing is personally too slow sometimes (since it is not motivated by any conflict or.The fact they did manage to film for an entire year is commendable.Overall it's like one of those nice paintings you see in your friend's living room.

23,5,This isn't about the mall.,tina-262-320202,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's been a while since we moved from Jasper. The mall is not as ""dead"" as i thought it would be.
That being said, this is not really about the mall or its history. In fact, very little about that is included here.
Instead, we have unrelated clips about random people filmed in and around the mall. We did see a few people we knew, which was kind of fun.
Would have been far more interesting had it included more content about the mall and less about the uninteresting people shown in the footage.",False
24,8,Sale--Owners Retirement,randomcha-179-678218,n/a,15/08/2025,"A beautifully structured observational documentary. Each vignette is a little gem. You really feel as if you know these people.

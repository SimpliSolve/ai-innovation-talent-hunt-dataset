1,10,7 minutes and 27 seconds,robert-mihoc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hello you IMDB reviewers! I have never did a review myself and right after starting the movie on HBO Max, I went to imdb and checked the people's opinion on it, and I was surprised to see that there are none. Thinking nothing about it, I went back to the movie.Knowing what happened there during the last 2 years, I knew what to expect.Now...keep in mind that as a father of two, I'm seeing this maybe with different lens, but after 7 minutes into the film, I had to pause and ask myself if I can actually do this, as in watch it. Seeing all the life stories from different people, praising the city and it's city life, it's quality of life and how things started to look better, one can only sit and wait for the tragedy to hit the wiewer so hard, that you just realize that it's not a blockbuster action movie where even if you enjoy seeing headshots, you KNOW that at the end of the day, everyone is safe and that those are stunts. You know that the city is not raised to the ground and it's just special effects.This is different because you know that at the end of making it, people won't cheer with a glass of wine for a job well done, cash the check and see about their lives. You know that those that fell as victims, they are real. The loss is real. The pain is real. And what's worse is that's irreversible.Now, I'll pull myself together and see the rest of the movie.",False
2,10,"Russian ""way"" of distruction",razvan-477-836095,n/a,16/08/2025,"The deep drama illustrated in this movie gives another occurrence, besides the countless ones, to understand the russian devastation of civilans lives in Ukraine. If anyone was needing another reason to see and consequently despise the russian aggression and destruction in the the last 20 years, here it is.The visible lack of care and reapect for human life by the russians is undoubtedly pictured in this movie, depicting civilian recodings during the siege and destruction of the city Mariupol and the randomly and merciless acts of cruelty against the civilian population. These grotesque acts will stay forever in the hearts the Europeans and this movie is another archive of what the purposeless vanity of Vladimir Putin does to the neighboring countries.",False

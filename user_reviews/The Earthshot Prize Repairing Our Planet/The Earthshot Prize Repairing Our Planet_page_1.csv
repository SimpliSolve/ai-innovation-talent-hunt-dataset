1,9,I like this Series,farshidkarimi,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just don't understand the low rating. It deals with the harrowing fact that we humans are wreaking havoc on this beautiful planet. What is wrong with it? It IS a FACT. Sir, David Attenborough is laying bare the destruction we are inflicting on the Plant and presents solutions.We thoughtlessly consume we carelessly exploit resources, quenching our lust for more and more and we do not look behind to see the trail of destruction we leave.",False
2,10,Super sad to see this incredible show with such a low rating,mydworld-26008,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's as if some people hate science and want to see humanity fail. I doubt most of those low scores even watched it. They just review bombed it because that's 'their politics'. Regardless, this show would have FAR more views if it listed David Attenborough as 'Self' on this. He's all over this show! Please change this imdb!",False
3,10,I loved it! I don't understand the lower reviews....,johnnybravoctk,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel like some people really want humanity to be destroyed. Lol. What about cleaning the air, sea, wilderness etc. Hurt you? This is really an Attenborough show by the way, for those interested in giving it a try. William. Prince William narrates the very beginning and end but in between is almost all Attenborough, which is awesome of course!",False
4,10,The Earthshot Prize: Repairing Our Planet,MrFilmAndTelevisionShow,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPerhaps I am biased but if I see David Attenborough I give a ten, if I see the Royal Family I give a ten. If I see bother Attenborough and a member of the Royal Family I give the highest ten imaginable. Prince William is doing the country proud. What a hero he is and with the enlistment of Attenborough to help we can all be glad the the world is moving another step in the right direction.",True
5,1,Hypocrisy knows no bounds,leehopkins-45843,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love to know what uncle Daves carbon footprint is?? Need I say more????????Okay I have to add more characters. This is exactly what is wrong with the world right now. Hypocritical dummies telling us plebs that we're ruining the planet while they travel around the world with huge entourages to ""show us said plebs"" the chaos that ""we're"" causing. He's not the only one by a long shot but after nearly 80 years of doing what he does he's one of the worst. How much carbon has he added to the atmosphere? No that doesn't matter because it's posh Dave and we all love him. Well I don't. He can stay home and I'll fly to Spain for 2 weeks in the sun.",False

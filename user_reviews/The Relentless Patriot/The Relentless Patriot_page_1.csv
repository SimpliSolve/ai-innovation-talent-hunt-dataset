This film tugs at my heart for all the right reasons. It will make you cry, it will make you angry, and the most important aspect...it sends out the message of hope. A message that is clear for everyone. Honestly, one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.As a veteran myself, I signed that dotted line to serve my country for the love of the people. Some didn't make it back home. It's about helping those who are less fortunate. This is why that flag matters.",False
5,10,PURE MAGIC,john-13043,n/a,16/08/2025,"Scott and his brilliant team of unwavering patriots have assembled a piece of American History. I hope this film awakens all who have been contemplating getting involved to do so- what we have is unique in this world and we are letting it slip away. Scott reminds us that what we have is precious and that's worth stepping up to the plate. Bravo to all involved. I have followed not only Scott but Christopher Martini who bravely embarked on a project ripe with critics and obstructionists along the way attempting to derail this project. In the end of a grueling five year plus project, Christopher Martini has blended over thirty years of Scott's activism into ninety minutes of pure energy. The music incorporated into this film is straight from the heartlands of America from some of the most talented patriots around. Their music, vocals and messages tie in beautifully. Can't wait for this film to be available for purchase so we can play it when we need it in times of need.",False

American artist Scott LoBaido has the desire and passion to show every service man and woman and all first responders that they have a country they can be proud of by painting and displaying the American flag where ever they can enjoy it!This movie is a powerful statement about one American who wants to make sure no one who lives in the United States, forgets what our flag stands for: liberty, justice, freedom, love of country and national purpose. Having served in the United States Navy along with my father and uncles who made it their life careers, the Stars & Stripes makes us feel a sense of pride and dignity. This movie opens a small window for all to see such passion and love of country still exists!",False
7,10,Inspirational!,robyncamp-86569,n/a,16/08/2025,"We saw this last night and it is amazing! We need more Patriots like Scott LoBaido who care about our country, and our veterans.

9,10,Just in Time,jonathanoswaks,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Relentless Patriot is one of those films that comes around maybe once in a lifetime, if you are lucky. It reminds us of where we came from and it reinforces that the heartbeat is still there. The film chronicles the life work of artist activist Scott LoBaido as he so openly reminds us of how and why we enjoy the freedoms and liberties we take for granted. Watching Scott travel the US paintng Old Glory for all to see in prominent places harkens us back to a slower and more simple time. A time the film reminds us that is slowly slipping through our hands. I entered with the hope of being entertained and left with a renewed sense of purpose and patriotism. God needs us to see this film, God put these good people together to create this film and God rarely disappoints. I can't wait to see it again and gift it to friends and family. God Bless Scott LoBaido and all who helped bring this to a grateful nation.",False

13,10,God Bless Scott LoBaido,horn-11610,n/a,16/08/2025,"What can I say? He made me feel bad I haven't done close to what he has done. Then again, no one has. What a guy. Passion and patriotism. I loved it. I'm flying my flag more proudly today than ever before. We absolutely laughed, cried and cheered! As an Italian American born and raised in Brooklyn, I felt like I knew him. As a retired cop who served New York City proudly for 21 years, I related to his drive and frustration. As a Trump supporter I felt his pride. My goal now is to save some cash to buy an original Scott LoBaido piece of art. I will hang it proudly in my house til I die. God Bless you, Scotty!",False

I got quite emotional several times while watching. Felt like Scott was really speaking to my heart and soul. He's such a talented artist, a great motivational activist, and a really great guy. I've met him a couple times and he was nothing but friendly to me. Doesn't matter which party you are apart of we are all Americans. We should all heave the drive and passion Scott has.

15,10,GO SEE THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW,barballen-77604,n/a,16/08/2025,"Do NOT give up on this country, and do not underestimate what each one of us is capable of doing. That's what this film has to teach us all. It's a reminder we all need- especially me. It's been extremely brutal watching the country my husband died in service of and my kids grew up without their dad in, being dismantled from the inside out. It's been painful to witness and experience seeing the flag that was folded on my husband's coffin being so disrespected by citizens and politicians alike (I'm talking to you, Pelosi) So Scott LoBaido is a breath of fresh air, complete with the sarcasm I love. Thank you to everyone who gave so much to make this happen. Everyone else- get your asses up and go see this film.",False
16,10,"MAGNIFICANT, TIMELY",bvdmorris,n/a,16/08/2025,"Christopher Martini bravely and masterfully executes the most pivotal topic of this generation through his documentary of the conservative, patriotic activist Scott LoBaido, who for more than 30 years has been a force to be reckoned with, expressing his love for America through his energetic artwork. Millions have served and died for this country for the values that shaped our nation as a Republic, and we continue to hold dear, yet are on the verge of losing. Whatever emotions it engenders in your soul, the message is clear. Collectively we must not let that happen, and his fight is OUR fight! The enemy is within our ranks. Kudos to Chris and to the Guiding Force that propels him to use his remarkable talents, his film-art medium, to bring the same level of energy to rise up ALL patriots and rally them to the cause.",False
17,10,Awe Inspiring Love Of Country. God Bless The USA,jeffevangelista,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love America, you must see this movie. If you hate America, you must see this movie. If you live in America, you must see this movie. If you don't live in America, you must see this movie. Scott LoBaido loves the USA, and thinks (and I agree with him), that the American Flag is the greatest piece of art ever made. Christopher Martini lets us in to see the life of a true patriot. Scott fights the battles, we all wish we had the courage to fight.

18,10,I am truly inspired and have a reignited passion for our flag and country,skibum-21490,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went into this movie not knowing what to expect. I came out wound up and inspired to be more vocal and interested in standing up even more for our flag and our country. The apologize culture has to stop. We need to stand up and be the bold Americans our grandparents were. We need to be the GIANTS that the rest of the world stands on the shoulders of. This film hammers that home. We need to call out and cancel the obviously corrupt and this fim hammers that home. It truly hits so many points square on the head.

If you have children, pardon the language in the film but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get them in front of this type of passion and dedication to our flag and our country.",False

Whether you are right, left, independent, or whatever; this is real art! I laughed a lot, I cheered out loud, and there were some really heavy parts that had me in tears too in regards to 9/11 and our veterans. Scott Lobaido is an American Bad-ass! 100%. I had never heard of this artist until I saw this film listed at my local AMC where I am an A-List club member. Its honestly refreshing that a corporate movie chain will play a film like this, with wild content.

A man who won't sit down or be quiet just because someone tells him he should.

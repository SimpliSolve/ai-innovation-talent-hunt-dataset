1,6,"If you slow down at a car crash to look, you will like it.",mabakerhtx,n/a,15/08/2025,"Is it a drama? Comedy? Tragedy? It is a a crazy mix of desperate Americans (mostly women) claiming they found love while on vacation with a hookup. The show is about their delusional thought process on how they are going to turn their vacation fling into marriage. Most go against the advice of their realistic friends and family. The drama unfolds as they discover that the one night stand may not be a cornerstone for marriage. Cultural differences, language barriers, financial motives and sexuality all play into the attempt at finding love.",False
2,7,Not that bad,meiramelamed,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't know why the negative scores, it's a reality show not a documentary but, still, interesting. The beautiful locations of the Caribbean, the young and stupid love we all had on vacationing abroad, the hope for a never-ending love story, its life and there is nothing wrong with that.",False
3,6,Desperate people,robinnation1,n/a,15/08/2025,Never seen any more desperate people trying to strong arm these people into coming to the USA where they will nag. Cage and try to manipulate forever. Pathetic.,False
4,8,I Have Never Encountered Such Selfish Women Before,destiny_west,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am definitely enjoying this branch off series from 90 Day Fiance - Love in Paradise. This series takes you through couples that have fallen in love with one being based in the Caribbean and what the next step is in their relationship.The absolute selfishness from some of these women involved blows my mind completely.You go to the Caribbean on holiday and have sex with a worker and not use protection? Seriously, I know accidents happen, but seriously? Then you basically want this man to move his life to be with you. Okay, it takes two to tango in any situation and he should have been cautious himself. It just blows my mind that people are still doing the unprotected thing with complete strangers.I won't go on, but definitely watch this series. It is worth it. I am hooked.",False

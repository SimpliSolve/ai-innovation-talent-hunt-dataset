1,1,Extremely biased,LizardKing97051,n/a,16/08/2025,An extremely biased look at what happened on Jan 6th 2021. The headline reads that it 'resulted in the deaths of 5 people' which has already been proven false by both sides of the political spectrum. This is a completely moronic and bigoted look at what activists with a micro-budget and their dad's camcorder can do when they don't have real jobs.,False
2,1,Mostly biased and false information,rosevalley12157,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film was mostly biased and very left leaning. The majority of people interviewed of course had to bring up racism, BLM and white supremacy. They thought Jan 6 was worse than the country being burned down by BLM all summer. It also presented false information saying 5 people died that day which is a blatant lie. It was said protestors brought in weapons, guns and explosives into the White House which is a blatant lie. One woman went so far as to say anyone who was at the Capitol that day should get 10 years in jail!! At least some people questioned why the Capitol police opened the barriers and let the people in. If you want the real story watch the Jan 6 Tapes on Epoch Times.",False
3,2,Dishonest portrayal of the day's events,rayblack-09413,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unfortunately this film offers a revised portrayal of the day's events. While the day was tragic, it did not result in the deaths of five people as the tag line insists.The film does have some interesting footage, and at the time of the film were no seen. However as time has progressed we know a lot more of what really happened. This film is basically obsolete now as it does not have a complete understanding of the events and the people that were involved. Yes, some were violent, but most were just there as a protest, similar to the peaceful protest of the BLM movement.Overall, this is a completely accurate film and should be dismissed as a film to understand the entirety of the day's events as it misses a significant portion of what happened.",False
4,10,Well done,Annie2121,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGreat documentary. I liked how it covered the reactions and witness accounts of what occurred the very next day after the Capitol Hill riots. Looks like there is even footage shot in the middle of the night after curfew, whoa. Nothing beats being in the scene of action as it happens. Makes you feel like you are actually there and on location. Because the news usually show you one side of the story I like how this documentary helps balance the narrative and show you another side. I enjoyed watching from beginning to end.I feel like some of the ""1"" ratings are fake. Almost like a bot wrote it. Trump supporters perhaps? Can this simple documentary be that much of a threat to warrant this kind of attention? Can this footage be used in any of his trials? Who knows. That's what I like about independent storytelling. Very little room for tainted information, just raw truth so everybody can make up their own mind. Like I said, well done.",True
5,1,Biased and not a complete accounting of the events that day.,bucksmba,n/a,16/08/2025,"The description of that day under the title should let you know this is not a serious film and highly biased.The film wants you to believe that five people died that day. But that is not true. There was only one and only fatality that day and that was Ashli Babbitt.The rest of the film offered film clips from that day. While there was a large amount of violence that day, the part that was not covered was the large amount of federal employees that were there that day and actively incited the violence. We know for a fact that federal employees were involved during that day. And we know that federal employees actively planned and encourage the the kidnapping attempt of Michigan governor.While this film was apparently released in 2021, there has been a large amount of film that has been released that was kept from the public. Now that that all of the video has been released we can see that most of the people involved that day did not participate in the violence.This is a film not worth your time.",False
6,10,Amazing Film! VERY NON-BIAS!,AntoinneDessalines,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is riveting, enlightening and super entertaining! The originality and in depth storytelling behind the drama /film noir feel is legendary!In the cover of darkness, on a jet plane the story kicks off, and we touchdown right at the center of Washington DC. Mayhem ensues..You won't find another film that is able to cover the real story from the very first moments the event took place to the chilling and tense aftermath. The eye witness testimony can't be denied, the unique footage that hasn't made it to news yet is a testament to the skill of the filmmaker's behind this film.",False
7,10,"Epic Film! They tried to give bad score, but truth is its awesome!",DeborahHan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gripping dialogue and supercharged visuals. This film is probably one of the best documentaries you will watch on the Capitol riots. It doesn't pick a side it just tells you what happened from the eyes of those who were there during and afterward. The filmmakers who covered the event also give a cool investigator voice over that really brings you into the climate and sets off the mood. Very cinematic touch.The best part is when we visit the church, and the lady gives her take on the issues at hand. Very raw emotions and honest criticism.The eyewitness testimony from both sides also is a highlight.",False
8,10,Truth hurts,kstephens8,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are those who will continue to deny the gravity and horror of what happened on January 6, even with the truth staring them in the face. It's shameful. Video footage of this day will live forever, a reminder of the actions of a depraved, self-entitled group of people who call themselves 'patriots'. Cognitive dissonance is real and readily on display in this violent invasion of our Capitol and the subsequent denials by supporters of this infamy. It shows in real time how different some citizens are treated when they behave in a violent manner as opposed to those who protest peacefully. We are a democracy and it must be protected from extremists.",False
9,10,Best Doc on the Riots! Very Bi- partisan !,EdwardLex67,n/a,16/08/2025,The film is for sure one of the best documentaries you'll see in regards to the events that took place at the Capitol. A lot of the interviews and commentary are from normal citizens who don't have the same limits that news organizations have to spread a certain narrative. Very real and very dramatic type of stuff from those featured.The best scenes was probably the narrative montages as the director traveled under the lock down and recorded all the Secruity. That was some high level footage no one got to see in news. I will edited and the fact it's short makes it a lot easier to watch and enjoy.,False
10,10,Must Watch,bryantruano-57597,n/a,16/08/2025,Must watch documentary. I loved the footage in the night after curfew and reactions of witnesses. Watching this in 2024 reminded me of the events that happened.Really good footage of what happened in Washington on Jan 6th that has never been seen before. Loved the film maker investigation/detective narrative.I remember when the riots took place and how chaotic it was. This documentary does a good job explaining the events leading up to the riots and what was going on a day after the riots and finally the aftermath.Whatever side you're on just remember we're a democracy and it must be protected at all cost.,False

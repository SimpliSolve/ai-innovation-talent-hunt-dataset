1,10,A must see documentary,PaulThomasA,n/a,16/08/2025,"Children of the Cult is a haunting and poignant documentary that delves into the hidden truths of the Rajneesh movement, a cult that gained notoriety in the 70s and 80s. Directed by Maroesja Perizonius, herself a child of the communes, this film is a powerful exploration of trauma, neglect, and abuse suffered by children within this controversial organization. The film is not only a must-see for those interested in cult dynamics but also serves as a crucial counter-narrative to the Netflix series *Wild Wild Country*, which largely overlooked the experiences of these children. Perizonius bravely takes on the task of connecting with fellow former commune children, and together they shine a light on a dark chapter of their shared past. Their stories are both heartbreaking and enlightening, revealing a society built on an alternative moral code where the most innocent were often the most vulnerable. The contrast between happy childhood pictures used in the documentary and the stark reality these people face today is deeply moving. It's a testament to how trauma can leave lasting scars, as these former children grapple with the legacy of their upbringing in a world where boundaries were non-existent. The documentary's impact is further amplified by its unflinching examination of the perpetrators, as Perizonius demands accountability from those who were once close to the cult's inner circle. It's striking how many Osho followers remain loyal to their master, often employing cognitive dissonance techniques to defend the actions of a man who facilitated an environment rife with abuse. This blind loyalty is particularly disturbing, underscoring the lasting effects of the cult's ideology on its adherents. In conclusion, *Children of the Cult* is a brave and essential work that challenges us to confront uncomfortable truths. It serves as a reminder of the importance of accountability and recognition of past wrongs. The documentary's reception, including its high ratings, reflects its powerful message and the urgency of its subject matter. This is not just a film; it's a necessary dialogue about the often-overlooked experiences of the most vulnerable members of society. Maroesja Perizonius and her contributors deserve commendation for their courage and commitment to unveiling these painful narratives. In short: a must see! Tip, also watch Perizonius first film about this subject.",False
2,10,Refreshing AND distressing,qppgqb,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have seen so many cult films but this one was outstanding because it was made by the former cult children themselves who had been deeply injured by their experiences. Their pain and the power of their stories made me both sad and proud. They seem to be holding their abusers accountable in a very simple factual way. Therefore it was not exploiting the sensationalism of the cult, simply presenting the unintended consequences of their (probably) well meaning parents. This was a very well made film based on solid research and the team seemed to have traveled big distances - historical, emotional and geographic in order to bring this about. Well done to the entire team. If you are interested in cults and the aftermath of the promiscuous hippy era and cults that touted ""free love"" (meaning sex) then this is for you.",False
3,10,A powerful telling of a painful and damaging history.,dk-movies,n/a,16/08/2025,"The stories of abuse and neglect from within Osho/Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh's communes around the world shine a raw and penetrating light into a world most known for pursuing enlightenment, sexual freedom and the crimes committed at Rajneeshpuram in Oregon. This film, told by the survivors themselves, paints an even darker picture that one cannot deny because of the pain and suffering seen and felt in the stories of those brave enough to tell them.A well paced, and quietly disturbing film takes viewers on a wave of retelling the life of the children of the cult... The other side of ""Spirituality"" from the world of Osho, where clearly no one was protected.",False
4,10,A Must watch!,lisamccamillo,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Children of the Cult"" is a powerful, heartbreaking, and essential documentary that sheds light on the horrific abuse suffered by children within Osho's cult. It is both deeply disturbing and incredibly well-made-brave, raw, and unflinching in its approach. The survivors' testimonies are gut-wrenching, and I found myself in tears multiple times as they shared their trauma and lifelong struggles. Their courage in speaking out is admirable, and the way the filmmakers handled their stories with sensitivity and respect makes this documentary even more compelling. It's shocking that this cult still exists today, operating as if nothing happened, with no real justice for the victims. How can this be allowed? This film is an urgent call for awareness and action-everyone must watch it, and something needs to be done to hold those responsible accountable.",False
5,4,Not quite . . .,units_hoopla_u,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who was involved with this group, and who has long since left it (and has no bias in favor of it), I felt this documentary was misleading. It is true that there were instances of pedophilia, and it is true that the teacher behind the group made all sorts of quite stupid, ignorant, and dangerous remarks about how to raise children. But I was very put off by the early statement in this film that ""everyone knew."" Everyone did not know. That is generally how these things go. In addition, the film maker seems to have belonged to a particularly toxic sort of sub-group -- a commune in Holland where children were sent sexy notes by adult men. She seems to extrapolate from this that all men were doing this to all children, which is patently not the case. There were very many deeply decent men and women in the community who would have been appalled to know such things were going on. The woman at the end, who underwent sexual abuse from Rajneesh seems to have rehearsed her outrage a bit too carefully. On the other hand, I thought they did an excellent job of getting Ma Anand Sheela on the record saying that children being sexually abused was their own choice.",False

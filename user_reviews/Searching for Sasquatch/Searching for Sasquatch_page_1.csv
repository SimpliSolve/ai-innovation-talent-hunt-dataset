1,4,"The ""researcher"" MUST be on drugs",Dottsylove,n/a,16/08/2025,"If he's not then my apologies. His behavior is completely erratic and unprofessional. . The guy is in the woods some of the time, so I guess you can say he's doing some searching. But even if he got a really good blurry video --no one would ever believe him.Oddly enough --- the people he interviewed have some of the more credible reactions (in terms of re-telling the story) that I've ever seen... Which is the only reason this gets a 4 and not a 2. And the only reason why I would have given it a 2 and not a 1 is because he at least did this program on the Sasquatch (and that's a plus in my book)",False
2,1,This entire series of mockumentaries are just silly.,swcolt-58235,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have to laugh at the reviews that claim Jason Kenzie is funny or has a good sense of humor. He is energetic, I'll concede that, but he has no wit at all. His humor is limited to lame, unfunny, immature quips made in response to comments from by people he is interviewing. It's like watching a smart aleck 12-year-old trying to be the class clown. And what is with his head? It's shaped like a semi-deflated volleyball, except bigger. Make that a basketball.As for the Bigfoot stuff: they get all excited about ""eye shine"" and footprints, but that's about all, other than eyewitness accounts of experiences nobody ever manages to get on film. Nothing new here.",False
3,1,As idiotic as you can imagine,jmrecillas-83435,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is like that serial from History chanel on what a bunch a morons believe that Hitler survive and went to Argentina to live undercover. The same idiotic plot, but with Sasquatch. Avoid at any cost like covid.",False
4,9,Seminal work on Sasquatch Crossing in BC,Bigfootbeliever000,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an entertaining and unique investigation into the possibility of the presence of Sasquatch in Western Canada. The interviews Jason hosts are believable, and his response of direct field work made me feel like I was going along with him into the beautiful back country of British Columbia. I found the aerial footage of the crossing breath taking. I have to admit Jason may not be the best person to investigate Sasquatch but he is very funny, engaging and seems like a very nice person. If you are looking for a great documentary on Sasquatch I highly recommend this one.",False
5,10,Hahahaaa Love his humor,JenaGroverOfficial1,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you start in the beginning of Jasons career you can watch his journey and love for animals expand. I have enjoyed getting to know him through his experiences.One of my favorites is when he rode an ostrich hahahaaa... oh man if you have time you should check into his beginning. His pictures and videos of animals are incredible! He has definately lived an exciting life ðŸ˜€
Jason is honest to goodness a good guy who works hard at living his best life and I think that's an incredible feat in itself.It is evident Jason lives for the moment and I LOVE that he shares his adventures with us!I recommend watching it all ;)",False
6,10,MUST WATCH! Highly Recommend,shesquatchers,n/a,16/08/2025,"Must Watch!!! Definitely not your regular boring bigfoot documentary! Jason Kenzie brings his funny sense of humor along for the ride. Some may think he should be serious all the time, but hey, most people aren't sticks in the mud and absolutely enjoy his humor. I do! Jason has a contagious gung-ho attitude which often reminds me of Steve Irwin. His dedication for the search is palpable and dives deep into some truly beautiful remote places as he is ""Searching for Sasquatch."" He talks to witnesses of all kinds, doing so without judgement, giving viewers the opportunity to make up their own minds as the info is provided for them to do so. I love this whole ""Searching for Sasquatch"" series of documentaries. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! ðŸ’ž",False
7,10,Such a fun series!,TammyTreichel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jason Kenzie is amazing! In a world full of researchers that are so busy browbeating each other over whose views are the only truth (kind of sounds like reliogion, huh?), Jason has a fresh approach that doesn't claim anything other than the search continues.Jason's videography talent is apparent throughout his documentaries. He has mad skills, and gets all the angles.His personality makes such a difference. He keeps the viewers engaged and his sense of humor makes you laugh right along with him!Such a pleasant documentary compared to all the competition to be the best. 10/10 recommend the entire series!",False
8,8,Such a fun and refreshing take on Sasquatch,sarah_Putnamfd,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this documentary on Sasquatch. The host was very funny at times and very relatable. Most documentaries on Sasquatch have more talking heads than out in the forest. The landscape images were stunning but I do wish the host would have shown more of the footprints in the lake.When I first read the other reviews (The ""researcher"" MUST be on drugs ) and (As idiotic as you can imagine) I had my doubts about wanting to watch this documentary but when I looked into the other movies they made reviews about, they seemed to be writing negative reviews about every movie they watched. I just figured that they were just bitter, angry people that probably hate their lives. Maybe jealous that Jason does some very cool things. I mean think about it! For somebody to write must be on drugs when they don't even know the guy is just straight up being a bully.The one thing that could have been better in this documentary was the lighting, when Jason was interviewing the native guy.I'm very happy I watched this documentary so If you like adventure and crazy fun humor, than this is a must watch.",False
9,10,Very Entertaining,lawsontoni-74088,n/a,16/08/2025,I don't know if I believe in Sasquatch and it's great to find a documentary that is also searching for the truth. I think Jason is funny and entertaining but also interviews credible witnesses that give the viewer reasons to believe. The scenery is gorgeous and I found the film to be very entertaining and fun to watch.,False
10,10,A different kind of creature feature...very nice,sphpssn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Right out of the gate Jason caught my attention, he is very energetic. Seems like a nice guy with a great sense of humor. I have watched many Bigfoot Documentaries and they are kinda boring with little adventure and to much old guys sitting in front of the camera talking. Searching for Sasquatch has a fast paced non stop energy that is different from other films.The footprints in the lake was a very cool find I only wish Jason had focused more time on them.If you are looking for a Bigfoot Documentary that will make you laugh out loud and have you feeling like you are on a journey through some very beautiful landscapes don't pass this one up.",False

1,7,Fascinating bad behavior BUT SKIP PETER NYGARD!,thejdrage,n/a,16/08/2025,"They are all awful - but Nygard is nothing but a filthy rich vile, foul dirty old man.Now I need to go take a shower. You will too if you watch this.It's disgusting. He's disgusting.",False
2,8,Rich and Shameless (Girls Gone Wild),trimbolicelia,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo far the only episode I've seen is about the creator of Girls Gone Wild, Joe Francis. What struck me most is the similarity between this franchise and its creator and the Playboy empire and its creator. Both these situations are about powerful men and the victims they choose, young women who don't know the score and are hungry for what they think is fame and fortune. At least Hugh Hefner had a little more finesse. Both these men weasel out of difficult situations, of their own making, With beaucoup bucks, super star lawyers, and starstruck judges and D. A.s who live for the art of the deal. The most telling and uncomfortable incident in this episode is his attack on his significant other, which was verbally caught on a phone. One of the most repellant things is how superstar celebrities are best buds with Francis. You'd think these people would have a brain in their heads and keep away from negative controversy and its creator. Especially controversy that exploits women in the most denigrating way.",True
3,3,Interesting... but lacks massive amount of details.,keyedaw,n/a,16/08/2025,They could give us so many more details. Like how much Martin Shkreli bought the HIV pharma company for. How he could afford it after his first two or three companies made no money. How he got his money to begin with. They start in the middle and leave out so much. How can they not get Gerald Cotton's body exhumed? He was a $200 million cheat but they can't get one judge to exhume his body? Gimme a break.Do better reassert and a more in-depth story telling. Otherwise great idea.,False
4,1,Bad,tlharrison-59546,n/a,16/08/2025,"I tried watching the first episode but I found it to be very boring. If you are familiar with Pam and Tommy's story, then there isn't much more to learn about it from this episode (though I only made it about twenty minutes in, so I can't say that definitively).I was very interested in the Girls Gone Wild episode. I am old enough to remember the constant late-night commercials for the DVDs, but not informed at all on the whole saga regarding the founder of GGW (Joe Francis).I usually look back to the 90s and aughts fondly, but this episode was an in-your-face reminder of how young women were treated and looked at in pop-culture at the time. And it was gross. Seeing clips of Joe Francis being praised by ""journalists"" of that time, for his genius idea of exploiting young women in exchange for tacky merch made me feel physically sick.Of course I shouldn't give this series one star simply because Jenny Jones complimented Joe Francis twenty years ago, so I'll speak more about the actual show.The intro song is horribly cringy. Re-enactment scenes are done with barbie dolls. Seriously. Barbie dolls. Why not just use press photos? Brooke Burke has emerged from the cocoon she has been living in since 2002 to remind us how ""WILDLY POPULAR"" -HER- tv show was back then. While I do recall Wild On with Brooke Burke airing often on E! In the age before the Kardashians, I don't remember knowing anyone that actually watched it.Why is Brooke Burke being interviewed about the founder of Girls Gone Wild? Because she met Joe Francis a couple times while filming her wildly popular show? She didn't seem to have anything of substance to say about him. Granted, I couldn't watch longer than fifteen minutes.I didn't watch any other episodes. It's just so hokey.",False

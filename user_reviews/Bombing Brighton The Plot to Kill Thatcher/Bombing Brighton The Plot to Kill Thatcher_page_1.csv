1,7,A somewhat interesting look at an event anaesthetised by history,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Brighton bombing, which nearly killed Margaret Thatcher, then the British Prime Minister, was arguably the most audacious of all the I. R. A.'s terrorist endeavours. Forty years afterwards, this documentary lets some of those involved speak. It's somewhat interesting, but somewhat hagiogrpahic regarding Thatcher, while Patrick McGee, the bomber, is essentially unrepentant (although he has since developed a slightly odd mutual understanding with the daughter of one of the victims) and refuses to disclose any operational details. Ultimately, Thatcher and other senior members of her government all survived, relagating the incident retrospectively to just one of the numerous atrocities that occured during the Troubles. One can only hope that they never return.",False

1,10,A Great Show,lilstrawbaby-78787,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have never been one for ""reality"" shows, but Hatcher Family Dairy is wonderful! I love how it's about family and caring for the animals, not just business and making money. The entire cast is warm and personable, it's a show you can allow your children watch and know they aren't going to be exposed to age-inappropriate subjects, unlike almost everything else on tv today. This show brings back happy childhood memories of my Grandpa's dairy farm and the time I spent there during summers. Because I happen live in Tennessee, I can say proudly that I purchase milk from the dairy as well and it is wonderful!",False
2,10,I can't get enough of this family,randymcbeast,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the America I'm proud of. A hard-working and loving family that opened up their lives for us to get a glimpse into, and I'm so glad they did.Each week, you get to see how they work and interact with each other and the animals on the farm. There are emergency situations where they all pitch in and the run of the mill life on a farm activities which are just fun to watch. I certainly have moments where I wish I could just pitch in and be a part of it.This is a very well done reality TV series. It's captivating and you just fall in love with this family. I wish them many centuries of success and happiness and I hope we always have a world where this kind of lifestyle is possible, protected and supported. It's just sad that trash like the Kardashians, MTV-reality and the Vanderpumps are what people are watching when they should be appreciating the life of the Hatcher family.",False

Having Hatcher's in our ancestry makes us feel even closer.I do appreciate the hard work and dedication this family puts into their work. It's truly a calling to farming, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine and a life lived on the farm.Thank you for giving us this insight into a world so few of us get to see.God bless!",False
5,10,"What a LOVING, TERRIFIC FAMILY",Lostsocalgal,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yep, I admit it,
I am just plain and openly jealous of Mary Morgan.I want my husband to call me LOVINGLY by my first and middle name. Instead of SOME of the ' other' 'names/words' of his choosing of that day or situation. Mary Morgan, you are one VERY LOVELY AND LOVED Woman. Now, I admit that I am TOTALLY SO NOT capable (or willing ) of shoveling manure, or pushing/scraping it into a pool of watered down manure. Nor, am I willing to chase chickens OR cows with cute names, even if it means that my husband is going to to START to oh so lovingly, and quite possibly call to me ENDEARINGLY by my first AND middle name!! Let me be TOTALLY clear, I am ONLY jealous of YOUR first and middle name rolled oh so LOVINGLY, AND starry eyed from your husband!! AND your VERY COOL Mother in law and KIND Sister in law, who is as WONDERFUL as my veterinarian that I have to PAY a LOT OF MONEY to!! Oh, Mary Morgan, I see a VERY, VERY cute as the dickens puppy bearing your name!! That way I can have my very OWN Mary Morgan.Oh, and your Charles, (does he have a middle name?) who works his you know what off is WONDERFUL!! Any man that is GOOD, KIND and LOVING to his mom and sister too, best not burst my bubble, I will never be the same. I so ADMIRE and ADORE YOU ALL. Saturday night is now my FAVORITE DAY OF THE WEEK ðŸ˜Ž. Oh you cutie Mary MorganðŸ˜‡, couldn't resist!!",False
6,10,Great Show - Impatiently waiting for Season 2,swray55,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoy the small family farm and the family cast is wonderful. Great characters who really love & enjoy what they do. Dr. Jennifer w/ her Vet practice & Charles running the dairy farm plus other family members like Mary Morgan & Sharon are perfect. The season was too short...please expand with more episodes per season and hurry with Season 2.I love the way they name all the cows with human names and actually call them by their names like family members. You can tell they all really care about thei animals.Good job finding the Hatcher Dairy Farm. I hope we get to meet more family members next season. Hurry up, can't wait for more episodes.",False
7,10,Please renew for another season!,cheeseplease-83381,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't find myself binge watching shows much... but this one I did!! I love their little family and how inspirational they are! The Hatcher family is so fun to watch! They are comfortable on camera and show us what working hard and playing hard looks like. The filmmaking is also beautiful and very uplifting. Great job, editors! Another beautiful thing about this show is that it makes me appreciate the food we can so easily access in the store. So much work, love and care goes into every glass of milk! Please please PLEASE bring this back for more seasons! Everyone wants more Hatcher Family Dairy!",False
8,10,Great family and show,sharonasexton,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a good wholesome show!!! It's always wonderful to see family farms doing what they need to do to keep their farm thriving. Sadly, in todays world the ""family"" farms are having a hard time competing with the corporate farms... that could care less about their animals. I'm hoping that someone / another network or production company picks up their show for more seasons. The Hatcher Family Dairy, shows that they care about their cows, they care about animals, they care about family and they care about their community. If I lived closer I'd definitely be purchasing my dairy products from the Hatchers!",False

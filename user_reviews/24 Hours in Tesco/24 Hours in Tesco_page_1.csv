1,4,"Wow, this was so biased.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fly on the wall look at 24 hours at Tesco Cheshunt.What planet is that manager on, 'we have staff to help customers?' get a job in Tesco, and see how much time you have to help customers, you don't, you have a huge workload, I'm stunned Nikki had time to talk to the cameras.To start with, this isn't a documentary, there's no balance, this is basically a PR exercise for the giant retailer, I imagine they show this video to new starters. There's no balance, it's all about how incredible Tesco are.The clubcard, it simply serves as a way of capturing data, basically giving you Asda prices, you may not be getting the bargains you think you are.I'll hand it to Tesco, they have really turned things around over the last few years, it's a business model to applaud.Cookies, if Tesco hadn't won that competition, I'd have pulled the plug off the TV, at least they had the cheek not to make the Tesco one beat Heinz.4/10.",False
2,4,Not a being the scenes so much as a trumpet blowing expose,Kimsy1724,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWell this programme was definitely a bust. I was actually really interested to watch it because I thought it was going to be a genuine insight into how the store actually worked like a ""behind the scenes"". I enjoy watching programs like ""inside the factory"" to see the magic behind how things happen and how processes work so I thought this program was going to be the same.Very quickly I realised that this program was nothing more than one big advert for how amazing Tesco think they are. There really was little to no actual insight or information about Tesco and how it works. The only thing I found interesting was how they very first came about and how they came up with the name.Tesco definitely took this opportunity to attack Aldi as often as they could. In the first 10 minutes of the program they had mentioned them 4/5 times and it felt like a desperate attempt to prove that they were every bit as good. To me this really just advertises that Aldi is a major threat to their business model because all the supermarkets now pride themselves on making sure they are ""Aldi matched"". If that doesn't highlight how successful a supermarket is that everyone's clamouring to say that they can match your prices, I don't know what is.The ""cookie tasting"" was ridiculous because the Aldi cookies had positive responses from everybody, the Tesco cookies had compliments but the last one (can't remember if it was Waitrose) had really negative feedback but yet when the results came in surprisingly Tesco came out on top and Aldi came out on the bottom? That didn't match the results of what people said.The beans tasting was another ridiculous point. Tesco clearly came last in comments about their baked beans. The people tasting them said that they were soft, without any texture or taste and they came out at the bottom but then the argument was that they were cheaper than Heinz and that was a good selling point. We all know that a stores own version is going to be cheaper. Heinz have spent years perfecting baked beans and it's one thing that they are known for so quite honestly, you would pay more for the brand name and the expertise of the product. It seems like a really really pathetic attempt to argue that their product was cheaper and therefore that didn't matter that it didn't taste as good and you were getting a tin of soggy pulp.The last one when they tested macaroni cheese ready meals was just ridiculous. Some eclectic singleton who is all too familiar at ordering ready meals because apparently being single means you don't cook and macaroni cheese takes an absolute age to make? I'm no cook but a cheese sauce takes minutes to make while boil some pasta and then mix it all together and bake in the oven for 20 minutes. This weirdo proceeded to eat one portion sitting on her sofa, one portion lying in bed in her dressing gown and then weirdly the last portion was eaten in a ridiculously awkward pose lying in the bath whilst trying to cover her modesty with the plate. She was all but completely lying flat trying to stuff macaroni cheese down her throat. Once again Tesco came out on top which I'm sorry to say against Marks & Spencer's, is absolute rubbish. Having tried two of the ones featured, I can guarantee the Tesco's one is definitely not as it was portrayed in this documentary.It's to be honest the entire thing of taste testing their products against other brands just felt like a constant last ditch attempt to prove that their products were the best. It just seemed cringeworthy.The segment on the Clubcard was weird because they made out like it was such a good thing and I myself have a Clubcard which I scan when I visit my local Tesco but they did themselves the disservice by showing that realistically you don't actually save much money using the special ""Clubcard holder prices"" and these are largely affected by which brand a store is working with and that's the same across any store when they have products on offer. Really all they've highlighted is that their club card is used as a way to get data on you, which at the end of the day we all know that. For me personally I would much rather, have Nectar points from Sainsbury's which I can use to pay for my Christmas shop at the end of the year. They even had some food blogger go in and do her normal shop and once again they price matched themselves against Aldi but I noticed that they didn't compare all products; only sang about the ones that actually came out cheaper than Aldi which is laughable. In the end with the Clubcard prices, they still only just matched Aldi on a shop and if you don't have a Clubcard, it would've cost you Â£5 more than Aldi.At the end of the day there is a supermarket for everyone and I myself enjoy visiting numerous different supermarkets for different stuff. Mainly I shop at Sainsbury's because I have one local to me and I like the products they offer but I like going to Aldi to see the different ranges that they have, I like looking at the Continental foods that I can find in Lidl and Tesco is the only place that does a dairy free and gluten-free porridge pot which I buy in droves to eat for breakfast every day. In a world where everybody needs to buy food and drink, there really is enough customers for everyone so this program really didn't provide anything other than a cheap effort at trying to self promote.Had this program actually been an insight into how the store worked from choosing stock lines to how they manage the amount of stock to how they stack the shelves... I would've been interested to have that insight but this just felt like a program where everybody had been paid to say that Tesco was the best. Even when they were doing blind taste tests, if Tesco didn't come out on top there was some stupid reason why they didn't come out on top.Where I live there isn't a large Tesco so I don't see even 1/3 of all the products that the massive Cheshunt store offered. I have to travel over 30 minutes to get to a store that holds clothing ranges or household ranges so perhaps if I had a bigger one on my doorstep, I'd feel more positive. I don't think they're a bad supermarket and I think they have some really nice products but this program just really put me off of them quite honestly because it wasn't 24 hours in Tesco's. It was an hour on why Tesco thinks they're great and that they can beat Aldi.",True
3,2,Documentary?,morganrlloyd,n/a,16/08/2025,I wouldn't call this a documentary. It doesn't indulge into anything. I was disappointed with this as I wanted to see a true insight of the Tesco lifestyle yet all I had was already publicised news and nothing beneath the surface. It reminds me gravely of a student film or a beginner YouTubers documentary. I'm not sure what the budget on this was but it most certainly wasn't enough. The people interviewed was brilliant along with the stores manager. It just lacked that information that a documentary requires to be successful. In all honestly you'll watch this leaving with no more information of interest than as you went into it. It's sad to say but this will not be a recommendation of mine.,False

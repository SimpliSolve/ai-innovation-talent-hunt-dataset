1,6,Last Flight Home,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is quite a touching, if very intrusive, look at the final weeks of former entrepreneur Eli Timoner. Being the victim of a freak stroke during a routine massage, his career was quite literally stopped in it's tracks as he, and his wife and three children, had to adapt to his increasingly disabling mobility issues and to the concomitant financial consequences of his inability to work. Now, at the age of 92, this lucid and engaging individual has had enough and so wishes to avail himself of his right to a medically assisted death. The political aspects of this documentary illustrate well the trauma the man himself and the family are put through as the regulations require clinical evaluation and for him to physically administer the doses himself - one heck of task for this frail gent. Doubtless this thread of the film will elicit a great many views on the right to die, and taken objectively this has valid comment to make that clearly contributes to that debate. Sadly, though, as we begin to follow the final days of his life - on an almost day-by-day basis - I found myself feeling increasingly uncomfortable. Not with the topic, but with the intimacy of the filming that was, essentially, none of my business. Daughter Ondi, who was behind virtually every aspect of this production, seems intent on sharing the most private moments of this rather emotionally charged environment. Her style of story-telling is supremely self-indulgent, and her attitude to her mother (who comes across as less enthusiastic participating in this audio-visual farewell to her husband of a great many years) really annoyed me. Indeed, as the documentary concluded I found the whole thing became less and less appropriate for general viewing. An ideal video-eulogy for the family, certainly, but for ordinary cinema goers it just felt that I was trespassing on their familial ordeal and, ultimately, grief. Perhaps my attitude is tainted by my own beliefs regarding euthanasia, but this film quickly stops being about that and develops into something I found became far more about the daughter than the issue at hand.",False
2,7,"Intense, but a bit held out",MayuMG,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler-Great message to raise awareness about voluntary death laws.-Well-edited.-Such a tear jerker. You'll be bawling at every moment.-I'm sure it was fine, but it just doesn't feel personally right to make a film about this? It just felt a little exploitative.-It did drag on a little.",True
3,10,A life affirming and inspiring film,davidmgale,n/a,16/08/2025,"Last Flight Home is a profoundly moving and emotional film that so wonderfully captures the life of a beloved
father-the kind of person we all wish we had in our life. It's an important film on the issue of assisted suicide but it's also life affirming and inspiring for anyone who's loved or lost someone.",False
4,10,How to define a life? Ondi Timoner's loving tribute to her father and family is as profound as it is personal,bradleyglenn,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Last Flight Home"" is a deeply moving film that is destined to start conversations between people and families and will shift the debate around right to die laws in the United States and the world. Timoner invites you into her family, a sprawling tribe of creatives and personalities, and through impeccable technique using personal archival video and images allows you as the viewer to see her father as they see him, as the ""good man"" he always strived to be. As her father battles his inner demons talking with Ondi and his daughter/rabbi, the viewer is asked to reflect on what it means to life a life worth living. What makes a ""good life""? This simple film asks the deepest questions and is a moving portrait of a individual and a family coming to grips with loss by injecting a man's last hours with buckets of joy. Don't miss this film. Share it with your friends and family and see where the experience takes you.",False
5,10,Poignant documentary,lucydblum,n/a,16/08/2025,"Last Flight Home is a documentary that had me thinking about it long after I finished watching. I felt as though I was a quiet observer in the Timoners' living room, watching fifteen days go by filled with grief but mostly a huge amount of love.",False
6,5,Good intentions but kind of exploitive,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Originally Premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival in the Special Screenings Selection""Last Flight Home"" is about in his final days, we discover Eli Timoner and an extraordinary life of wild achievements, tragic loss and most of all, enduring love. LAST FLIGHT HOME shares a stunning verité account of a courageous family confronting life and death. ""Last Flight Home"" is a documented by Timoner's family members regarding with his last days before his passing and the film examines the historical background about his career and family life. While there are a lot of interesting things to know about him, unfortunately, this wasn't the documentary I was hoping to look for. The presentation is pretty good, the sound designs are pretty nice and it was nice that subtitle's were provided for moments that were difficult to understand.Timoner is an interesting man and knowing about his history and important makes the concept more interesting. The topics exploded were interesting such as the voluntary death laws and family. But the problem of this documentary is that it kind of doesn't know where to settle and what tone it wants to be. The topics were not as explored as I want it to be as it could of keeps going side to side. The soundtrack ruins the entire experience because the music doesn't fit properly to the film's tone and personality and it only just makes it annoying and highly preachy for what it is. The interviews were both of a mix and bad as some of the interviews from relatives and friend gave good insights while the rest felt like they were misplaced and not necessarily informative to what the point it. Honestly, it kind of felt a bit exploitive and a little disrespectful for him.I'm sure people will like this one and I can understand it. But I wish there was more to offer.Rating: C+",False
7,10,Beautiful and universally impactful,atstellato,n/a,16/08/2025,Last Flight Home is such a personal and intimate guide on how to live your life and how to end your life with love. Bravo to the whole family for allowing such an important document to exist during their most vulnerable time.,False
8,1,An exploitative take on the end of life experience,fdxmypzjp,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's nothing fantastic about the death of a loved one no matter how it comes about. I lost my dad 15 yrs ago and I feel that this film is exploitive and glorifies assisted suicide. Although it is beautiful when you have time to come together as a family to celebrate one's life before they die as I and my family did, it is still tragic that they would not trust life to end in its own time and terms. Pain is part of life just as joy is. That's what makes us human and how we learn to deal with what life throws at us. . There is a set time for everything under the sun and the need to control every aspect of life is foolish and unnatural. We should not consider ourselves to know best when it's time to go. Only God does- ""He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end"". Ecles.3:11.",False
9,10,"Poignant, soul stirring and everlasting",tucia,n/a,16/08/2025,"My wife and I just watched LAST FLIGHT HOME and it was incredibly powerful - wow what a truly extraordinary documentary! The director did such a tremendous job capturing the candor, humor and depth of those last sacred moments with her father, and with the family, his legacy - so poignant, so soul stirring. And what a powerful way to humanize the right to die too. Pure genius.I was particularly moved by some of the moments with the director's mom, and the journey they both went through about whether she was connecting enough with her husband in his final days. It's interesting because the viewer also recognizes this almost immediately, the way mom hovers in the background, the chronic storytelling, the incredible place of pain it must be coming from. And when the director prompts her mother to just BE with him, we're all right there in the room with this family. Yes, just be with him, don't report back, now is the time! And yet it's all coming from such a place of unmistakable love. It's those raw uncomfortable moments that make this film so real, so familiar, so important.And the relationship between the director and her sister is incredibly moving too. There's a moment when the sister (a rabbi) is leading their father through a final conversation of healing, of shedding his shame before he dies, and the director begins to contribute to the conversation, which frustrates her sister to no end, and there's this moment of subtle confrontation between them where the director ultimately recognizes where her sister is coming from, contemplates the importance of what she was trying to contribute, her role as the director maybe, yet yields the floor - the history between them is palpable, the history of sisters.The history between the rabbi and her father is so poignant too, without gobs of backstory - just a beautiful bite about the irony of her father's initial reluctance to her becoming a rabbi, versus her own reluctance to truly recognize him as her father. But in his last days, she does finally connect with him as her father, and alas, he keeps calling her rabbi, rabbi, rabbi. It's so painfully clear that he is also recognizing her, validating all the choices she's made in life. That just slayed me.The visual storytelling is extraordinary too. Like a beautiful transition from their dying father's bruised hands (from the IVs), to an old home video clip with his younger hands folded over his grandson's. And the posse of teenagers who ham it up in the yard, yet their final moments with their grandfather are so tender, so heartbreaking. Exceptional work on every level.Plus, the patriarch of this family is not only hyper intelligent, but incredibly perceptive about the world around him, with a wry sense of humor that is everlasting. Some of his hilarious one liners are still floating through my mind... ""horse's ass"" ""fully oxygenated"" ""bunch of saps"" - my god what a remarkable spirit he is, and always will be. Thank you for making this film, for sharing it with us, and the rest of the world.",False
10,9,"A caring, touching and brave masterpiece",evolves,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerKudos to the director for taking us through the last days and seconds of her father's life and her family's experience. Her courage and bravery in documenting the entire process - through the moment of his death and the cleansing ritual afterwards - capture a life experience that we as society don't provide any preparation for. Typically, only when you have experienced the death of one parent are you in any way prepared for another, although not really even then.The film goes a step beyond ""How to Die in Oregon"", which introduced us to the concept of Death With Dignity. ""Last Flight Home"" shows us how an individual and family can deal with an inevitable death with respect, grace and humility. Choosing the moment of our own death is the penultimate personal right. By being in control one can say one's goodbyes and avoid the trauma that a sudden departure inevitably imparts on one's survivors.",True
11,9,A very moving experience,mstellato,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Last Flight Home"" is a very moving experience. It illustrates perfectly the right to die debate. Although everyone agrees that people have the right to live life as they choose it, there is no agreement on the right to choose how to end one's life. Where the law allows it, all these rules and procedures are put in place. This movie illustrates the affect these 'safeguards' have on the people involved. It leaves you thinking long after the credits roll.....",False
12,10,Fabulous film!,miriamnparker,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerOndi has done a fabulous job in speaking about a very difficult subject. It was such a personal look at a family dealing with the end of life in a thoughtful and meaningful way. I felt that I was in the room and involved in the process with the family as they said good bye to their Dad. I was captivated from the start. Very well done!,True
13,10,Bold and moving,hayleybennett-98740,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie tackles a difficult subject in an intimate space with the audience. It changed my perspective and will be something that will open conversations I would never have otherwise.,False
14,10,Redemption of faith in humanity,amyteitter-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI had a unique experience watching this film, as I've had the opportunity to meet and spend time with Eli and the Timoners during his final years. Eli was everything portrayed; a kind, wise, witty man who kept his sense of humor to the end. I did not know him prior to his accident, but had heard many stories of his greatness and loving heart, through the best and worst of times, which this film captured with perfection.I had not experienced or witnessed this type of supportive family where I come from, it's more of an anomaly. I had the pleasure to work with Ondi on her film, Mapplethorpe, where we became close friends. The Timoners embraced me from the start, making me feel welcome and providing me a much-needed respite; a safe and comfortable place to join in some of their celebrations, allowing me a window to a new world of positivity and kindness. My previous life experiences, for the most part, demonstrated codependent trauma-bonding, conflict, divorce and people inflicting pain and sadness on each other. I've always been blessed to be ""adopted by"" or ""welcomed into"" open-minded families, such as the Timoners, who allow themselves to experience joy and had values more consistent with my own, where I could receive validation and witness, what I believed to be, a bit of sanity.The pandemic prevented me from traveling to LA when I received news that Eli had decided to end his life so I attended the funeral over zoom. It was extremely difficult for me to watch the funeral alone from 3000 miles away so I knew the film would be equally painful. I decided to invite my friend, Nena Thurman (formerly Nena von Schlebrugge -wife of Robert Thurman and mother of Uma) to watch the Sundance premier with me. I had filmed a project in her home over 2 decades ago and she had become another parental figure and rock for me at crucial times; bestowing invaluable information on me when I became severely ill from toxic mold exposure at work. With our current medical system still in the dark ages, I attribute my current state of health to Nena introducing me to literature and a protocol that saved my life. I believed she would appreciate this film, because, much like Eli, she has lived an exhilarating life of work, travel and accomplishments, while also falling victim to painful and paralyzing health complications, which kept her in hospital for several long months. She related to Eli's state of mind and respected his decision, the families' support and execution of his wishes. As one of my favorite esteemed critics, she had many compliments for Ondi's film, her family members and the final days of Eli's celebration of life. We were moved by his grandson who asked for advice on ""how to live life"", to which Eli responded ""Love those you know and respect those you don't"".To summarize Nena's commentary; this was a refreshing embracement of reality with depth and compassion, as opposed to the shallow redundancies that Americans are so prone to; something that is uncommon to see portrayed in the states, in life or on screen. To quote Nena, ""This was a unique and important film that should be seen by everyone and deserves to win awards"". I full-heartedly agreed.America is about preserving life until the very end possible moment, despite the quality. Nena and I agree that people should be allowed to choose to end their suffering with dignity. I watched my grandmother suffer for a decade longer than she should have (or wanted to) at the hands of our ignorant and corrupt medical system and it was far from a positive experience. I will always appreciate having seen this film.I will also add that we found the film and Q&A so compelling that neither one of us could find an appropriate time to go to the kitchen for tea, as we didn't want to miss a moment. Well done and thank you to Ondi and the Timoners for allowing themselves to be filmed during such a private, emotional time and sharing it with the world. Love to Lisa, Jukie, Rachel and the rest of the clan.",True
15,10,A huge fan of this beautiful man and how it's done right,fqrpypfv,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film should win every award ever given. It is so up close and personal, such an intimate portrayal of a family with so much love and respect for each other.I held on to every word Eli said; he was so very lucid in the body that held him prisoner, and his quick and hilarious wit will never leave him. He was the same kind, funny and thoughtful man he had always been. His lifelong-loving wife, Lisa, and his children and grandchildren loved him so, and were a constant in his life.We cried because he felt bad about his past grievances, and because it hurt so much to see him in so much pain (but still putting out the quick quips). His daughter, Rabbi Rachel, assisted him in letting go of his guilt and shame,; to allow his soul and spirit to become light.It was just such a private peek at how a wonderful man lived his life, the decisions he was very clearly insisting on, and all of the immediate support and true love his family and loved ones and close friends gave him. He set a lifelong example for others to emulate and share.Eli was the real thing. He is loved and missed by thousands of people whose lives he affected positively. After this film is out, hundreds of thousands of people will get to see what a moral, unconditionally loving, extremely intelligent man he was. The way our planet of humans should live their lives, every day.Al in all, it truly does deserve an award. The best independent non-fiction film we have ever seen.",True
16,9,A thought provoking,rosalbazingarelli,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am extremely moved by the family's bravery and willingness to welcome us into their home at a most difficult and vulnerable time in their life. We watched it as a family and the conversation continued and still continues. It was truly thought provoking! This documentary has triggered us to dig deep and reflect on our personal meaning of life, death, love and dignity.It is a conversation everyone will need to have and this movie has encouraged us not to be afraid to talk about it. Thank you to Eli and his entire family for sharing their experience with the world.",False
17,10,An Emotional Look At The Last Days of a Great Man,randall-21767,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've followed Ondi Timoner for years and this is her best as she bares her soul when her father decides it is time to die. She takes us inside his home as she and her family prepare for his death. At first it feels invasive, but soon you are part of the family's emotions and Ondi creatively tells the story of her father's life as he says goodbye to friends and family. There are times you laugh and other times you cry but the end is very uplifting as her sister (a Rabbi) exhorts us all to get rid of self shame and blame long before we die. It is something Eli Timoner finally did on his death bed. This is a must see, life changing documentary.",True
18,10,A Life Affirmed,isaelluke,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn Ondi Timoner's stunning documentary Last Flight Home, viewers are given the gift of spending time with Eli Timoner and his family. While the film is structured around the last weeks of his life - after he decides to pursue his right to California's end of life option - what unfolds is a celebration of a life well lived. Eli Timoner was a philanthropic and business icon in Miami. He started Air Florida, which became the fastest growing airline in the world at the time. When his wife Lisa first saw him, she thought he was beautiful. They had three children, Rachel, Ondi and David, and life was magical until an injury disabled him. Showcasing her award-winning storytelling skills, Ondi Timoner provides us a seat right next to her family so that we too bear witness to how they reconciled celebrating life in the shadow of a death chosen. And it is through this unflinching intimacy that Ms. Timoner allows us to discover the universality of their experience. We see our own parents, children and siblings, sharing stories and experiencing moments of joy, sadness, regret and even laughter. While his body is failing, Eli's mind is sharp and his quick wit provides many moments of levity in the film. We also have the privilege of watching him say goodbye and dropping pearls of wisdom to the many people in his life whom he touched. Keeping watch throughout the film, Eli's wife prefers to stay in the background. She is happiest when witnessing the organized chaos of her large family, like a conductor who knows that her orchestra is in pitch perfect tune. Team T, as they call themselves, will renew your faith in what we can do for each other in life and in death. It is fitting that Eli Timoner started an airline because he will take you on a journey that will have your soul soaring.",True

20,9,A compelling and heartfelt story,grantaparker,n/a,16/08/2025,"Last Flight Home takes the viewer into the deep questions that humans have the ability to ask now. It is a very intimate movie an will tap into the viewers own experience with life and their families. It requires the viewer to ask themselves a question they may have the privilege to ignore until watching. It is powerful and doesn't provide an answer for everyone, but shows a family struggling to find the answer for them.",False
21,10,Ondi has done it again!,sophietrue,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerShowcasing the extraordinary superman that her father, Eli Timoner, was, Ondi intricately weaves her audience through the journey of a brave, yet harrowing decision he chooses to make. Never have I thought of death as artful or so intimate, yet 'Last Flight Home' highlights the rollercoaster of pain and tragedy as such in a tremendous way.The film's score (created by Ondi's fiancée, nonetheless, whom Eli grants a blessing over their love), combined with the shots of sunny suburbia both highlight the close attention Ondi pays to any and every detail while curating a story. Stepping into the role of both daughter and filmmaker, her strength is unparalleled.Although obviously heart-wrenching, this documentary is filled with hopeful symbolism, religion, a sense of familial union, wisdom, and courage. 'LFH' serves as a memento to the past, present, and the future, leaving its viewers both moved and blown away.",True
22,9,One cannot walk away unmoved,KUChad2,n/a,16/08/2025,"You can not walk away from this movie wo feeling all of the love and strength, not just from Mr. Timoner, but from the entire family. Going from the highest of highest to have their world fall out from under them in an instant, the Timoner family still managed to win by maintaining their unbreakable bond with each other. This film reminds us that one does not need to be weathly to be rich, does not need material things to maintain class and does not to have it easy to have it good. I so look forward to seeing all of the things that this film does in accolades, but also how much it touches other people's lives!",False
23,9,"Extraordinary, fierce, courageous, one-of-a-kind documentary",kouneva,n/a,16/08/2025,"Words fail to express what a transcendental experience watching Last Flight Home was for me. It's an absolutely extraordinary, fierce, courageous, one-of-a-kind documentary.I enjoyed learning about Eli Timoner. One of the most indelible lines was him saying how all banks turned him down, after he's given so much to so many earlier in his life. Above all, the love he gave to his family, and how much he was loved resonated through the entire film.In our culture where death is a taboo I admire Ondi Timoner for her incredible courage to create such intimate, visceral, multidimensional experience of death in real time.

It took us in their home & hearing all the discussions amongst them & the doctors. The love of the grandchildren around him, the caretakers and friends who visited.

This is an up-close heart-wrenching documentary about someone ending their life, i.e. Assisted suicide.

It's very difficult to watch, but also impossible to stop watching. I appreciate that there were no politics involved, no discussion about the end of life rights and laws. Just a family carrying out a dying father's wishes.",False

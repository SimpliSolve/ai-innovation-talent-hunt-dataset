1,9,A must watch,unNeil,n/a,16/08/2025,"A timeless yet contemporary documentary that interweaves bith heartwarming and heartbreaking narratives, creating an emotionally rich experience that will leave a lasting impression.Employing a 'fly on the wall' storytelling technique, the documentary offers an unobtrusive and intimate look into the lives of its subjects. This allows one to fully immerse themselves in the stories being told, heightening their emotional connection and creating an unforgettable viewing experience.As the film unfolds, one prompted to ponder the potential impact of adopting a more philosophical mindset in society. By challenging our preconceptions and encouraging reflection and introspection, this documentary invites us to reevaluate the way we perceive and engage with the world around us.In essence, this documentary is not merely a collection of stories but a transformative journey that explores the depths of human emotion and the potential for the development of a creating harmonious society that comes from embracing a more thoughtful and reflective approach to life.Young Plato stands as an essential viewing experience, one that will leave you both moved and inspired, with a newfound appreciation for the power of storytelling and the complexity of the human experience, through the lens of a boys school. The key message being that 'violence breeds violence'.With its captivating narrative, emotionally evocative moments, and a thought-provoking themes this documentary is unmissable and compelling.A classic documentary that's both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.",False
2,9,"Positive message, perhaps needed more grit",bjhex1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Quite an educational and heartwarming documentary about utilizing philosophy to change a culture of anger and violence at a primary school level.It's well made and clearly is heartfelt in its delivery. Having young boys learn to think for themselves and apply conflict resolution techniques can certainly resonate with parents worldwide, not just Belfast.But while the presented conflicts come primarily from backsliding boys and a pair of rambunctious cousins in particular, it becomes apparent there is an entire other, more daunting, obstacle to be tackled. Namely the parents who adhere to the old ways. It's only tangentially touched upon in the film, and clearly was omitted to maintain the positive energy of the message. But, in my opinion, confronting *that* is what would have been necessary to lift the film above an aspirational story for a new generation, to a landmark document for sea change, (a 10 star rating from me). And it can't be overlooked that for all the talk of philosophy and freethinking, they are still at a Catholic boys primary school, notably sidestepping any discussion of the culpability of religion in the matter.",False

4,10,One of the most poignant documentaries of the decade.,liamconnolly-41205,n/a,16/08/2025,This film shows the innocence of growing up surrounded by politics that costs lives. The way the headteacher tries to embed a new way of thinking to potentially save lives in the future is incredible.Easily 10 star rating.Beautiful music throughout to evoke emotion.,False
5,10,"Heartwarming, human movie.",brendan-fogarty,n/a,16/08/2025,"In multiple levels this is a super movie. One has to be in the right frame of mind , it ain't a Holywood blockbuster now.To me it impressed in the followingthe importance of teaching / early years pastoral care in sculpting future adults.how 1000s yr-old philosophy has still to teach us as we continue to make the same mistakes today as they did in Ancient Greece.a glimpse of what life would be like in theabsence of the safety net of schools/teachers ie in Covid lockdown, and how children would suffer.a history of N Ireland conflict.Wonderful teachers and personalities who restore your faith in humanity. There are no heirs, graces or falseness, just a unsullied passion to help others. Wonderful to see this world where there are no hidden agendas or internecine plots that one may see in so many other areas of life.",False
6,10,Both heartbreaking and uplifting,suemcarpenter,n/a,16/08/2025,"We know from Dead Poet's Society or perhaps personal experience that one teacher can make an indelible mark on students that can positively influence the rest of their lives. In this film, we witness this influence in the making, as the head teacher at a boys' primary tackles playground incidents and upsets in the Philosophy Room, encouraging students to work out why they acted in a certain way, and to think in alternative ways. It was brave for the parents and boys to consent to show their vulnerability, but made for a hugely emotional and touching film, with powerful lessons for us all.Sensitively shot, in a purely observational style, letting characters and storylines unfold, set against a lurking background of historical religious violence. Do watch.PS I don't know the filmmaker!",False
7,9,An Inspiring Educator in Every Way,Sil-Azevedo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such a tender documentary about a gifted and exceptionally dedicated educator who is busy healing the wounds from decades of violent history in Ireland. Kevin McArevey is a fascinating man on a mission: to raise a new generation who thinks for themselves and who will be ready to create a better future. The film is beautiful shot, following McArevey as he goes about his business visiting homes, connecting with the community, and changing lives at the school. Little things like the dancing Elvis doll on the dashboard (he's obsessed with the icon) bring a colorful dimension to the character that makes the film a joy to watch. As a former teacher and filmmaker, this hit the spot for me. I think it will inspire anyone who wants a more peaceful world.",False

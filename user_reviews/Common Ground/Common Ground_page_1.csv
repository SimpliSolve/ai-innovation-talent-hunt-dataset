What sets ""Common Ground"" apart is it's approach to deal with such controversial topics like the ongoing Roundup Trial. The film sheds light on the injustices and the environmental consequences, giving a voice to those who have been affected.

2,10,Common Ground now common knowledge,RalphR-67,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is the kind of cinematic documentary you hope that everyone watches and not just for the purpose of entertainment. This movie has great potential to inspire a brighter future for everyone. A romantic view, I know, but a true statement, through the progression of the narrative of cold facts and intimate stories envelops us. It feels like we finally get to see the secrets behind the root of the issues plaguing the agricultural industry. For many, these concepts might be new, and to those mature enough to handle the truth, queue up this movie and get ready to have your eyes opened.Put simply, our Earth's health is in crisis, largely due to the inconsideration of the harmful effects caused by the malpractice of large-scale agricultural farming and ranching. Animals aren't the problem. Neither are the farmers. Misinformation is at the root of the issue, and until recent years, many professionals like media and scientists who spoke out have been silenced for trying to share there findings. Many ranchers are hesitant to make the change out of fear of being unable to make returns on their land. Conventional farming practically promotes a guaranteed profit through subsidies, so many don't consider the change as necessary. But results from the trailblazers farmers and ranchers in this documentary who made the change are found great results. A remarkable difference in plant life cycles, which help make a difference for the environment, and it's all centered around the soil. When we take care of the soil, all stand to gain from it, the rain cycle, plant life, and in turn, a cutback of the money necessary to cause both. The very chemicals intended to help grow these plants actually help destroy the nutrients in the topsoil. Take Gabe Brown's farm for example. In the film, we see a considerable difference in the health of his land and the neighbors' besides him, a huge difference in quality soil. Also, Rick Clark, a large-scale farmer, switched over to no-till and removed pesticides. He saves roughly 2 million after changing to regenerative ranching. This could help diminish a developing health issue in farming and rural areas. The chemicals find their way into the water supply, poisoning it and causing unhealthy births but that's just one major problem. That's why people with a voice are important to spread awareness, that's why I appreciate the influencers like Jason Momao and Patricia Dern for being passionate advocates for this movement. Overall, it's an enticing piece of cinema, and the world is lucky to have such experienced directors like Joshua and Rebecca Tickell working to help make a difference in regenerative agriculture.The results of the switch to regenerative farming are amazing. Seeing the long-term effects come to fruition, like dust lands returning to grasslands. This was made possible in Chihuahua, Mexico, which gives an uplifting feeling in contrast to seeing the harsh reality of those who continue to conventional agriculture practices. My hope after watching the film is that more people see the success of ranchers like Alejandro Carillo in Chihuahua and recognize the ability to reverse the effects of desertification and add longevity to the planet's climate health through the regeneration of the soil. Many desert areas need water, and through scheduled grazing and diversifying plant life, you can restore the soil health and reinvigorate the surrounding area's rain cycle. It's truly a life-saving process restoring plant life through soil treatment. Except that this isn't a mirage oasis in a desert, it's a potential reality for the whole planet. I have no doubt this documentary will do great things, motivating farmers to consider making new strides toward healthier methods, towards what is important, growing things the best way possible.Just sharing this movie with friends and family doesn't seem enough for me. The dire message and the stories shared rattled my complacency, reminding me that even though I'm an individual in no way causing this problem, my efforts can make a difference in helping solve it. This information might change someone's life for the better in the future, and for that reason, this inspirational piece of cinema is a great place for a mature mind to start their interest. IF enough people adhere to the documentary's message, it could end up adding longevity to the future well-being of everyone. Very rarely does a documentary hold such a strong potential for positive change. Those who have tried before had not yet been informed or cultivated so concisely with such an influential piece of fact-based cinema. No longer must you turn a blind eye, or be misled. Sit back, queue up this movie, and get ready! The story is happening as you read this, and it starts with the ground right underneath us.",True
3,10,An Environmentalists' Must-Watch,IsaiahA-071,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the moment the film opens, Common Ground demonstrates a mature self-assuredness in its message. The film's impressive suite of familiar faces, such as Rosario Dawson, Jason Momoa, Laura Dern, and Donald Glover, each kick off the film by composing letters to the future generations. These letters serve as both warnings of the impending climate disaster, and also promises to make a difference now, before things get worse. There's a problem, and we must solve it. That problem is climate change, and if humanity can't work together for a solution, there's no backup Earth.The damage to our environment in the wake of industrial agriculture is difficult to hear about, and even harder to imagine fixing. Green grasslands and forests are turning into deserts. Soils in our farmlands are turning to dust. Carcinogens from pesticides and herbicides are leaching into our food. In the face of these threats and challenges, long-time eco-documentarians Joshua and Rebecca Tickell offer what few other climate documentaries of this kind can: a real, actionable solution to climate change. A solution that doesn't just halt the destruction, but reverses the damage already done. A solution that's been hiding just beneath our feet.Through the testimony of regenerative ranchers and incisive contributions of soil experts, Common Ground reveals a better way to go about farming known as regenerative agriculture. This approach to farming involves managing farmland for soil health and avoiding practices that damage the soil microbiome. Where conventional agricultural practices such as pesticides, herbicides, and tillage kill microorganisms in the soil and rip up the delicate root networks that allow carbon to be stored in the earth, regeneration offers a wholesome alternative, strengthening plants against pests by natural means such as managed grazing, fertilizing with manure, and sowing seeds without damaging this natural system. Regenerative agriculture harnesses the power of photosynthesis to siphon dangerous amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, drawing them down into the plants we grow and storing it securely in the soil, reversing the damage of climate change.The film further illustrates through stunning close-ups and sweeping landscapes shots alike how regenerative methods improve human nutrition, enrich rural communities, and restore the water cycles vital to life. This beautiful cinematography enlivens an assortment of impactful real-world examples from successful regenerative farmers. While his neighbor's conventionally managed field remains an expanse of barren dirt, Gabe Brown's regeneratively managed property stands as thriving pastures and cropland. In Williamsport Indiana, Rick Clark saves millions of dollars per acre through regenerative methods, showcasing the potential for regeneration to enliven rural economies across the nation. Meanwhile, Alejandro Carrillo brings life back to the arid Chihuahua desert, harnessing regenerative soil management through managed grazing to literally create rain! These methods are having a tangible impact on the places they are implemented, and Common Ground invites us to witness these transformations first-hand.With a contemplative and moving soundtrack by Jacob Samuel Snider and Jim Fairchild, and the beautiful cinematography of Simon Balderas and Joaquim Pujol, Common Ground offers a narrative that transcends mere exposition into artful revelation. Shots of sprawling fields and mountains give a holistic, birds-eye perspective on the landscapes affected and changed by these natural processes. Orchestral swells and punctuated silences lend the movie a feeling of belonging amongst even the most affecting cinema. Common Ground is impactful, insightful, and shows us what real solutions to climate change look like! Thank you Joshua and Rebecca Tickell! And thank you, especially to Gabe Brown! Here's to regenerating the future!",False
4,10,Important message,JHK-008,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a follow up documentary after Kiss the Ground (2011), which is somewhat inferior in standards of documentary-making and seem to target a younger viewer's range, but with the same important message: that we ruin the earth and our topsoil with current practices of industrialized farming. Furthermore, companies like Monsanto in particular but the food industry as a whole play an abject role in applying propaganda (attacks on whistleblowers), manipulation (funding farm colleges and rogue science) and bribing of government officials and government-policies through campaign funding. The cost in terms of public and ecological health is alarming. We have to turn this around or we will go down as the generation which leaves a gigantic mess for the generations to come.",False

6,9,The power that can be clumped from the garden,JoshuaH-925,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a letter. A letter that serves as a warning for the future generation. For our world. This is how the documentary Common Ground chose to start the journey with the audience. Starting off with a somber tone that many documentaries follow while discussing environmental health. But where Common Ground branches off is how by the end, the audience is left teary eyed and full of hope that it is never too late to start making a better future. And that letter then serves as a promise that we will never give up. Common Ground stands as its own piece of art that delivers a clear environmental message and how we can change the world. Just from using soil.The directors Joshua and Rebecca Tickell dives into one of the most powerful tools that can heal the world's and human health which is regenerative agriculture. This is the process of reshaping the ecosystem so it can be used to produce benefits for humans while aiding the world's health like reducing carbon from the atmosphere and bringing animals back to an ecosystem. We experience the power of regenerative agriculture as the documentary takes the audience across America to meet insightful experts on the subject. In North Dakota, regenerative rancher Gabe Brown compares his luscious farmland full of animals chirping to his neighbor's land that has turned into a gray block from modern agricultural practice. Up north in upstate New York, regenerative rancher Leah Penniman brought life back to an ecosystem that was deemed to have the worst soil health in the area through regenerative practices. Far west in California, Founder of Ecdysis Foundation Jonathan Lundgren teaches the truth of regenerative agriculture from the lies that he was taught from the agrochemical companies control of the agriculture education system. All of these narrative elements are guided by the stellar narration of Laura Dern, Rosario Dawson, Ian Somerhalder, Donald Glover, and Jason Momoa.It's not just Tickell's directing skills that shine in the documentary. The production gets to show their love for the cinema arts through their own work. Zianna Milito's detailed animation provides visuals for Tickell's writing to make the different insights of regenerative agriculture more understandable. With some animation moments, it feels as if we are part of the explanation as the camera travels through interweaving roots and flowing with the carbon dioxide which has the audience stay engaged with the explanation. As stated before, the documentary travels in the U. S. as the main setting. This containment doesn't just allow the audience to follow the documentary's story, but also show them how close these individuals are to each other. It gives a comforting and hopefully feeling that these like minded individuals are not scarce throughout the world. It feels that the documentary sways regenerative agriculture as a collaborative effort with anyone can engage with the practice and heal the world. And this is the biggest accomplishment of the documentary: encouragement. At the end, the letter at the beginning ends with a hopeful promise that we won't quit in healing the world. This statement can spark hope within us and aid in the battle for a better world.Common Ground chose to do what many documentaries could not: bring hope. Through the content and filmmaking, the documentary is a great watch for any person, and I hope they found hope as I did for the environment.",False

However, we are living in a society that is so incredibly divided that we forget this simple fact. Despite all of our differences, we all share a common ground, the soil in which we live upon. It's from the soil that we are sustained. Common Ground by Joshua and Rebecca Tickell, dives into the fact that soil is what is keeping the environment stable.

1,n/a,It ain't much but it's honest work,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"TLDR: Nothing astounding in terms of content and cinematography, but still a powerful image of dystopian future on our threshold.Movie balances on the verge between vox pop and personal take on the topic by the creator, mr. Rahul Jain. Interviews with ordinary Delhi residents intersect with his off-camera thoughts, supplemented by scenes with a courageous journalist woman.Documentary takes its time, giving us time to watch the everyday scenes of Delhi occupants life. Even if duration of the film wraps around only 70 minutes, the long, static takes make the film seem to last longer.It is rather a depressing image of one of the least human-friendly places on earth, a postcard from hell, made with precision and factual adherence. Not very groundbreaking stuff for people interested in ongoing climate catastrophe, but still an important image and reminder for what is about to come if our leaders will not wake up.Watched at Docs Against Gravity 2022.",False

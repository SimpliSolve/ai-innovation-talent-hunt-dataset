1,3,An unremarkable documentary,andrewshvidkiy,n/a,16/08/2025,"As for me, the film turned out to be lackluster; in real life, I would compare it to late autumn. Stanislavsky, a great man, thought that in this documentary I would see something more and something that was unknown, but he was completely no different from the usual videos on YouTube about him. I also noticed that at first it is about Stanislavsky and suddenly it turns somewhere into the wilds and you can no longer hear about the main character of the documentary. Bottom line, a lot of unnecessary material was added to this creation, and as for me, you can safely reduce the film's time to 30 minutes and not lose anything, not even the aesthetics itself.",False

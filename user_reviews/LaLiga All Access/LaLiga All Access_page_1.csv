1,7,"La Liga version of Drive to Survive, with less of the forced drama",xvandenw-28837,n/a,15/08/2025,"Laliga: Mas all√° del gol does a good job capturing the different backstories, rivalries and development of the LaLiga season in a relatively short amount of time.It's always a challenge to cover every team in great detail, but I feel the correct stories have been chosen to highlight in the series. Also, quite a lot of big names (David Villa, Iker Casillas, Xavi, Lewandowski, Rakitic, etc.) are interviewed to shed their perspective on things which is always better than ""outsiders"".What I also like is that the drama is not forced. If you have some football knowledge you know that most of what is being said is true. Therefore, liking it more than the sometimes ""forced"" drama of for instance Drive to Survive.Overall a pleasent watch, although no groundbreaking or shocking reveals throughout the series.",False
2,7,"A very entertaining and interesting watch, but the fake commentary is awful",philip-f-reid,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm a little bit addicted to sports documentaries, as they usually provide fascinating insights into how the sport really works and the personalities behind the football clubs or the teams. And this one is no different. I didn't know much about La Liga before watching this and now I'm super interested in that league. I like how it focuses on all the teams in the league, even those battling relegation. If you like sports documentaries then this is a great one, except that it has this fake commentary when they're showing excerpts from matches which is just infuriating and awful. It's the same annoying voice every time.I hope they improve this if there's a season two, but definitely worth a watch overall!",False
3,4,A series about a championship without the champions,gergio,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe series manages to provide a sometimes intimate BTS insight into important identification figures of clubs or the clubs themselves. The juxtaposition of Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad, and what makes the two Basque clubs different, is one of the highlights of this documentary series. The small Catalan town of Girona and its surprise team are also given a wonderful portrait.What falls by the wayside, however, is the momentum of the sport - the Spanish championship. A few sporting moments are picked out and the league table is mentioned in between, but that's about it. There is no feeling of being part of the sporting ups and downs of the Spanish championship.It's also a shame that the Spanish league champions barely feature in the documentary. The reason for this is that the club refused to allow the documentary to be made and did not allow the cameras to see it. No fault of the production team or Netflix. But... In narrative terms, however, this breaks the documentary's back. It's almost ridiculous that in the final episode, ""The Finale"", the embarrassing overtime/dismissal reality show segment of FC Barcelona with its coach Xavi Hernandez is given more space than the victory of the best & most dominant Spanish team of the 2023/2024 championship season.That's not all access.",True

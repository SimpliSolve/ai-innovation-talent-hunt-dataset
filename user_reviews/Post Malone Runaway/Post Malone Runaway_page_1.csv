1,8,This Tour is Unforgettable,toseale,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't keep it a secret that I absolutely love Post Malone's music and person. From the collection of tats, iconic aesthetics, record-shattering music, and so much more, this man is a legend. And maybe that makes me biased to the Post Malone: Runaway documentary . But I don't care. Did it have a whole lot of depth? No. Did it really need a whole lot of depth? Also no. Post Malone is one of the greatest rockstars to exist, and my opinion, the greatest. This documentary encapsulates just who he is and how unforgettable the Runaway Tour was. Posty stood with some of the best artists alive today on stage every single night of that tour, and seeing that through a documentary was amazing. The behind the scenes really showed what it's like to be a great artist after every show, and I loved that aspect. This documentary is a sunflower in a field of roses.",False

1,8,My kids love it,klowkristy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have a 7 year old boy and a 5 year old girl and they both love it.It can be hard to get kids to watch documentaries some times but my kids were glued to the screen for every episode. They give each insect a story and that along with the amazing camera work makes it feel like a movie which helps the kids stay engaged.It isn't the most ""educational"" in terms of just throwing facts at you but it's a good one to introduce your young kids to if you want them to learn about insects as each episode teaches them about bugs that they will see in their back yard or city and what their role is in the city environment and made my kids want to go outside to see what insects they could find.Nothing wrong with the voice actor but if you don't like Awkwafina you may not like it.",False
2,6,Funny view on learning about bugs,standedulleofficial,n/a,16/08/2025,"""A Real Bug's Life"" (2024) is a docuseries about what the title implies, bugs. This series is a not too serious view on the lives of bugs in 5 episodes.The reason why i say: ""not too serious"", is because of the silly music, and sound effects. For example zooming in on an ant trail and it sounding like a highway with cars or a spider webbing up it's sleeping space and it sounding like it is taping up something with scotch tape. This can be amusing in a childish kind of way, but it is not what I specifically am looking for in nature documentaries.Casting Awkwafina as a narrator was good in my opinion, she has been getting a lot of big roles so this is a good change of pace. The only thing that bothers me is the way they went with the dialogue, this is definitely not my cup of tea.The humor and music they use in this series is not particularly amusing to me, hearing rap or them making a joke about a spider dreaming about seeing a fly in all of it's eyes is not the thing i am looking for when i am wanting to learn about certain critters and creatures.I really enjoyed the close-ups on every creature so we could really enjoy what they look like in high quality footage, this is done with the latest and newest technology of course.I get that it is called after a beloved Pixar animations movie and that the goal is not to be too serious, but in my opinion this is what makes it less like something i want to watch.",False
3,8,Eye-Opening Fun,rabbitfish63,n/a,16/08/2025,"We've only watched the first season so far, but we love it.This show is extremely well structured, written, and edited. Every episode carries you along with great confidence. This is a show that is obviously aimed at kids, but we enjoyed it as well. Even when we were seeing things we are already familiar with, like the lifecycle of the monarch butterfly, the intimacy of the cameras, the details were all a revelation.It is completely incomprehensible to me how people didn't enjoy Awkwafina's narration which was funny and sweet. The writers gave her some corny lines, and she pulled them off beautifully by not overselling.",False
4,10,Great series about bugs and jumping spiders,mlewis-17754,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI first heard about the show when my mom texted me about it at work and I found about this show about bugs and spiders on Disney plus overall I finished watching all 5 episodes in one day and it was fun interesting and enjoyable my favorite is the jumping spider one in episode 1 a big city and the jumping spider üï∑ looks exactly like the one I own but scenes with the horse fly and fly scenes were gross especially in episode 1. We're the fly lands into the dog poop then flys in to the cheeseburger to transmit the bacteria from the poop then the dog owner's eats the hamburger üçî the whole sequence was disturbing and made me feel uncomfortable however I still love it and enjoy it it's interesting see to how bugs see the world in there perspective because of how tiny they are I highly recommend that children and adults watch this that it's full of the lot of interesting knowledge about bugs üêû and many types of spiders.,True
5,n/a,"Great video, terrible narration!",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"My favorite nature documentaries are about insects and microscopic organisms. So I was pleasantly surprised to watch these over the course of a few days. I thoroughly enjoyed the video footage and cinematography but the narration from Awkwafina, the narrator, ALMOST killed it for me... and not in a good way.I think that she could have been a decent narrator for the series but needed to take the role more seriously. The childish script from the Disney production team was a part of it but her tone and ""jokes"" really pushed it over the edge.Video Score: 8/10
Audio Score: 3/10Total Score: 5.5/10.",False
6,8,A Journey into the Depths of the Psyche Through the World of Insects,adorerreza,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Real Bug's Life"", produced by National Geographic and narrated by the lively and witty Awkwafina, is a nature documentary that defies conventional categorization. On the surface, it appears to be a simple exploration of insect life, but at its core, it is a multi-layered sensory and emotional experience that encourages a fundamental reevaluation of our relationship with nature. I rated this documentary 8 out of 10-a reflection of its exceptional quality-but I believe its full depth only becomes visible when approached from a psychological perspective rather than a strictly factual one.From the very beginning, it's clear that A Real Bug's Life aims to do more than just inform or amaze. By utilizing cutting-edge macro photography, drone tracking, photogrammetry, and ultra-slow-motion footage, the series reveals a world both strangely familiar and profoundly alien. This paradox-of recognizing something we never truly saw-offers the first opening into a psychological reading of the film. Psychology, one of the mind's fundamental mechanisms is projection: we cast our internal conflicts, fears, and aspirations onto the external world in order to comprehend or tolerate them. In A Real Bug's Life, insects are anthropomorphized-given personalities and roles that mirror deeply human narratives: the lonely spider in the city, the selfless ant in crisis, the nomadic beetle in search of home, the nurturing bee.This storytelling device isn't just for entertainment; it serves as a symbolic bridge between the viewer's psyche and the natural world. Audiences unconsciously identify with these creatures, as their behaviors reflect archetypal themes-cooperation, perseverance, isolation, metamorphosis-that are deeply embedded in the human subconscious.Another psychological strength of the documentary lies in its playful, child-friendly tone and narrative style. While some critics have dismissed this approach as overly simplistic or lacking scientific rigor, I would argue that it is precisely this childlike perspective that makes the documentary powerful. It invites the adult viewer to once again see the world with the wide-eyed wonder of a child-curious, open, and unburdened by intellectual filters.What A Real Bug's Life offers is a return to what Jung would call a ""pre-rational"" state of mind-where intuition and sensation are prioritized over logic. The show does not dumb down its message; it simply communicates through a different language: that of emotional resonance, symbolic storytelling, and visual poetry.One of the documentary's most subtle psychological effects is its reconfiguration of scale. In modern existential psychology, one source of anxiety is the individual's sense of insignificance in a vast and indifferent universe. Interestingly, this documentary flips that dynamic. Suddenly, beings we usually ignore or step on become epic protagonists in their own narratives.In this inverted world, the viewer is no longer a towering, central figure-but a humbled observer, peeking into a microcosm of complex survival, ingenuity, and community. This shifting of scale offers a quiet psychological relief: if a beetle can thrive in the face of chaos, maybe we can, too.Each insect species in the series acts as a symbolic figure drawn from the collective unconscious:
Ants symbolize sacrifice and collaboration,
Bees represent structure and social order,
Butterflies embody transformation,
Spiders reflect solitude and hidden creativity.The documentary taps into these archetypes without being didactic, allowing viewers to engage with them intuitively. In this sense, the show becomes a mirror through which we see parts of ourselves that are often buried beneath the surface of daily life.When viewed through a traditional lens, some criticisms-such as the overuse of CGI, cartoonish narration, or simplified storytelling-may seem valid. But A Real Bug's Life isn't trying to be Planet Earth or an Attenborough documentary. It is part of a new generation of ""experiential documentaries"" that aim not just to educate, but to transform how we feel, how we connect, and how we interpret the living world.Rather than evaluating it with outdated benchmarks of objectivity and seriousness, we need a new framework-one that acknowledges its role in shaping perception, evoking empathy, and reawakening wonder.",False
7,5,Concept and camera work is amazing but...,arangibbs,n/a,16/08/2025,The narrator and script really let this production down. It is clearly aimed at 8-10 year olds (not surprising for Disney) but the voice over track was very annoying to the point where muted it half way through series. The script lacked proper facts and any depth of detail.Captions for the names of the bugs including common and scientific names along with a fact sheet would have enhanced the educational nature of the programme. And instead of sitting on the fence 'suggesting' bugs are good and necessary it should have been at the forefront of the narrative.This would have gotten 2 star if it wasn't for the amazing camera work and my love of bugs as macro photographer.,False
8,4,Not an Awkwafina Fan for Narration,jorta,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe first installment of this series, highlighting the lives of inner city critters, was not the best choice in my opinion, featuring flies enjoying pet poop then transferring its bacteria back to the pet owner's own hamburger. Then we get to see baby cockroaches hatching! No wait, according to Awkwafina's offhand narrative, baby ""cocka-roaches."" You're never going to hear David Attenborough say Cocka-roach, which is another thing that sets this show apart--it's not the most educational of the bunch; it's more like a kid-friendly PR piece for the insects most urban kids are likely to encounter, with enough gross details thrown in to hold their interest. The impression I got was, ""Look, a bug! Ewwww."" Did it make me want to see more? No, but I don't think I'm among the target audience for this show.",True
9,4,"Looks great, terrible narrator.",justinaaronharper,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never watched a wildlife documentary that mentioned twerking. Seriously.This narrator was literally as bad as it gets. Of all the wonderful voices out there why would they choose this women, her voice was very distracting and ruined it for me. My kids didn't seem to notice but for the adults I have to say it took away from the story.Positives, it looked great. Most Disney stuff looks great. I have noticed Disney's quality in everything has gone way down over the years. Everything LOOKS amazing but that's not good enough. Everything else was good but ruined by the narrator and some of the dialog.",False

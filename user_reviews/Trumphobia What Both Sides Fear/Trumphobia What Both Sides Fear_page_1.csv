1,8,Effort to show several POVs,kariannec,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watch a lot of telecasts from Braver Angels, a bi-partisan group dedicated to getting a tone of civility back into politics. This film was discussed at one of their programs-you can find it on UTibe, look for Braver Angels.Contrary to what several below are suggesting, Carolina said she is a liberal, and set out to get several points of view, outside of the so-called ""echo chamber"". I was impressed with her and haven't seen the movie yet but plan to watch as soon as I have an opportunity. I appreciate her effort to make it possible for all of us to get a glimpse of all sides of the issues.",False

1,6,already dated,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a National Geographic documentary on the US-Mexican border. My guess is that it's filmed a few years ago with the caravan and all that. It's early in the Trump administration and there's probably a reason to release it right before the 2020 election. There's a quick and dirty history of drug, corruption, and American interference in Central America. It follows a group from Hondurans concentrating on the only girl, Ludy, in the group. It also follows a family with small kids. With history rushing past so fast, it's obvious that this is looking backwards and it doesn't even mention Covid. It has some good stories and good cinematography but it's already dated.",False

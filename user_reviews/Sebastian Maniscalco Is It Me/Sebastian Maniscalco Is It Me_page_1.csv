1,7,"Sebastian ""rolled the dices"" at Vegas and comes up short!",LouSmiles-129-719334,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had high expectations of this Netflix Special, Is It Me.Loved the premise of #Throwback-Vegas. I was expecting something different. This special was not one of his best. There was nothing close to his ""passover"" or ""airport"" or ""dance moves"" storylines that made you laugh and left you talking about those segments many months later! Middle part was good, but the beginning and end were weak.Love the guy. Follow him on IG. Doing the ""Special"" on ""Vegas Stars"" of the past 50 years would have been hilarious!Sebastian, time to step out of your ""comfort zone"". How about including your cooking and grilling experiences, your parties with your neighbors coming over, the difference cultures in your travels, how Canadians are different than Americans, eh! Music tastes or the habits of musicians, etc.In my books, you are always a 10. However, when I compare your previous work to this ""special"", this was a 5. If someone is not familiar with your previous work, it was a 7.Looking forward to seeing your next show in my city!#LouSmiles.",False
2,6,Doesn't quite hit it for me..,privatelyed,n/a,16/08/2025,"A little mellow all around, and to have performed as such in Vegas, didn't quite hit it for me. Not on par with his previous venues..not as animated..not as loud..and, frankly, not as funny. Need to come up with new materials not involving family members..sometimes, it can br a bit tiring hearing about stories involving his wife and Father. I thought for a minute old Vegas would be the subject of the show since it started out to be leaning that way but, it turned out, not to be..I was going to pay the price for this show since I was in town during the segment, I'm glad decided not to at last minute. A few laughs, but nothing spectacular//",False
3,5,Even the greats have their lesser moments.,macc99,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sebastian is one of the great stand-ups but no stand-up can catch 'lightning-in-a-bottle' every time. Maybe he lost a little form through the lockdown, maybe he got a little flabby through playing stadium gigs. Or maybe not - comedy is an elusive art-form and there's no formula for making it work every time.There are great moments but it's quite far into the show before it starts to catch fire; such as when Sebastian nails the absurdity of his local schools' inclusivity policy. He also has a lot of fun playing with the audience's over-sensitive reaction to an ethnic reference, and the story of his trip to see ""Hamilton"" is a reminder of how good he can be. But on the whole the show never really takes off.Disappointing, but he'll be back one day with a killer show - he's one of the best and great performers like him don't stay down for long.",False
4,7,Starts off strong then dips hard quick,ammar456,n/a,16/08/2025,"I haven't followed Maniscalco's stand up in general, but I caught a glimpse of this and got intrigued. The 'reservation' bit was hilarious, I reposted it, kept using it in a few of my general convos, and couldn't wait to watch the whole thing.When I finally got around to it, I think the show started pretty well. The throw back to when people 'dressed up' to go out was nice and nostalgic, some good relatable relationship stories, and his demeanor for the show was pretty amusing. Laughs in the crowd, all was good.By half way mark, he somehow lost the crowd. I think it was around the 'dog' story. From there on, everything became less and less relatable, and the crowd kept getting quieter and quieter. Couple of mild laughs here and there, but overall was very hard to watch.Would def recommend watching the first half of this, but then go back to whatever you're doing and leave the second half to play in the background. Definitely interested in watching more of his previous material now though to see what I've been missing.",False
5,1,It pains me say this about an A+ comedian...,daniellepwilks,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was so excited to sit down for the evening and watch this special as I have watched every special that Sebastian has put out - his work is AMAZING (you know the voice, gefilte fish amazing, lol)Something here just didn't work - I am 45 minutes into the special and haven't laughed once. I would like to say I am exaggerating but I'm not.Material wasn't funny, delivery was off or overdone, routine felt very out of sorts, a lot of anti pc points came across weird....Didn't watch the rest. I know comedy is super hard but Sebastian set the bar high - this one just wasn't even close to his usual.",False
6,8,He's Never Disappointed Me,breathinglifehouse,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sebastian has always been a riot. I discovered his comedy at the height of the pandemic. He's on my top list of comedians. This special is hilarious, just like all his other specials. He's the most consistently funny comedian out there right now. I love how he makes fun of the overly sensitive American culture and tells it like it is. He pokes fun at everyone, which is how comedy should be. I actually had tickets for his Cincinnati show last year but decided not to go due to Covid concerns. I won't be letting Covid stop me next time he rolls into town. Watch this special and prepare to be entertained.",False
7,4,It IS you,SixteenFiftyNine,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a big fan previously. This one was way, way below past stand-up specials. Bits start and seem to not go to a real punchline moment. Feels like he forgets where it's going midpoint. Sebastian's stand-up has typically been laugh out loud loudly funny, this one was good for snickers. His eyes appear red and many have suggested maybe he was stoned for this performance which may explain how the bits end with a whimper and no good punchline. The greyhound bit just seemed to evaporate after the visual bit, that was all there was? Disappointing. Giving it a 5 might even be generous for me. I'm almost surprised Netflix deemed this to be suitable for streaming, everything felt unfinished. I hope this is not what to expect in the future. Had I paid to attend this show I'd have been rather irritated.",False
8,8,Lots Of Negative Reviews...,genious-35413,n/a,16/08/2025,"From people that sound like they don't know who he is, or they don't like that he had evolved and changed it up a bit. To say that this special is 'painful' to watch is ridiculous. Hearing him talk about 'Roary the Lion' was a great bit and a great middle ground for where everybody SHOULD be when it comes to this latest challenge in society.But of course, some will always take issue with something and they are free to 'change the channel' as they claimed they did. I'm not sure what 'channel' they had their TV on but... okay.His mannerisms and exhaustion with the annoying people in this world makes for an enjoyable hour. So stop reading useless reviews like this one and watch it at least through the bit about Roary the Lion.",False
9,4,First draft,cdc123,n/a,16/08/2025,"Good grief that's hard to watch. He thinks that making faces, bold gestures, talking like a working class Italian immigrant is funny. The bits have no arc. There's a beginning and then he flatlines. The most forgettable stories with no insight. His observational skills are puny compared to Seinfeld. Someone close to him needs to tell him, don't do that again. I kept thinking of Steve Martin talking to John Candy in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"":""And by the way, you know, when, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea. Have a point. It makes it so much more interesting for the listener!""",False
10,1,"Wow what happened? Use to love Sebastian's stand ups, switched the channel midway.",dayana421,n/a,16/08/2025,"Husband and I loved Sebastian's stand up, watched each episode a couple of times. But so disappointed and surprised with Is It Me? Netflix special. What happened to sharp, witty, clever punchlines, ethnic warm humor that made us laugh, it felt like it never took off. Although was not funny at all we watched it awhile, after all it was Sebastian. Midway my husband turned to me and ask if I want to go back to the movie we were watching before and put it on hold to watch Sebastian. Wow what happened?? So disappointed , so many stand up comedians that are not funny but Sebastian was a huge exception, hoping that a talent like Sebastian will go to his original zesty humor that everybody loved so much..",False
11,10,FUNNY AS ALWAYS,sianoanna,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't believe all these negative reviews. As always, Sebastian has me hysterically laughing at every joke. He is making fun of a lot of the ridiculousness of the politically correct extremes. Maybe the people writing the negative reviews are ""offended"" or ""triggered"". He isn't afraid to say what anyone sane is thinking. I feel sorry for those of you who will pass on this. He is one of the funniest comics today. A lot of people just don't have a sense of humor anymore. I get it. He appeals to a certain demographic. Those that don't understand his humor need to lighen up. I'm so glad I didn't listen to all the negative reviews.",False
12,4,Flat,durrah-19014,n/a,16/08/2025,"Didn't really feel much like a stand up special. Just some guy who tells stories and is a little funny. Lacked punchlines. Some of the stories even cut short. I was waiting for the Asian punch line and got nothing, it's almost as if he forgot the joke, ""it matters he's Asian"" then he gets dude tracked by another story and forgets to go back to that one. But the hardest part was the ending. Like a soda can without the bubbles is the best way to describe it. Genuinely bad climax and just random with no point. In all honesty I would have given it a two, but some of the stories gave me a couple of chuckles. But yeah that's about it. No good.",False
13,10,Funniest comedy on Netflix,iamjamalwhite,n/a,16/08/2025,This guy slays. Old fashion classy comedy that makes you uncomfortable but laughing. I have COVID-19 this week and am watching all the funny. This is the best of the crowd. Doesn't shy away from controversy but doesn't push bad politics on the crowd. No pumped in laughs. He is relatable and we were dying. Gotta wonder if he is this funny in life. He talks about how silly liberal schools are. He relates his wife using heels in the snow. He talks about guns. It is all good. He brings the funny. Feel bad for children who find him offensive or say he doesn't have punch lines. The best comedians don't spoon feed you. Watch this!,False
14,4,"Overdone boomer ramblings, no punchlines, just mild stories a 50 year old might consider ""wacky"" enough to be funny",backup-50362,n/a,16/08/2025,"The start is poor, he comes in with his usual mentally challenged voice doing very slow, very banal jokes about ""my wife / my dad"". He's done this countless times, I was hoping for something new and better.The special picks up steam near the middle, though, and has its moments and fun stories, although not a single one to actually make you audibly laugh, like someone like Bill Burr or Patrice Oneal can...Sadly the ending is as poor and generic as the beginning, just once again - yet another ""my dad"" tale that wasn't even a joke, just a story without really a punchline.It feels about as bad, overdone and generic as Jeff Foxworthy and Jim Jefferies' last specials. Speaking of Jim Jefferies, at least one joke here felt like it was copied from Jim, which is some Inception stuff, because Jim himself is quite the joke stealer. Another two jokes felt pretty similar to Bill Burr bits.So this wasn't really worth the excitement I felt for finally getting a comedy special on Netflix from someone recognizable and generally good.I think it's time to change things up, Sebastian.",False
15,3,Geez that was painful to watch,venividivintage,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not sure what's going on with Sebastian but geez that was painful to watch. I'll be honest with you, i only made it half way through and i FORCED myself to even get there.I will say that i loved all 3 of his previous specials and have watched them multiple times each. It was such a gut punch watching this - i didn't laugh once. Even the people in the audience didn't seem all that into it. It seems like maybe the fame got to his head, he was very low energy. It's like he thinks he doesn't have to work for it anymore - you're an entertainer...you have one job...be entertaining!This one really just missed the mark, much like Bill Burr's last special, this was cringe inducing.Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Sebastian should take his own advice and ""Stay Hungry"".",False
16,8,Solid set from one of the best,hazzaboombatty,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this, not sure why so many people haven't but I have a fair idea. He states a few things in this set which may not sit well with the identity politics people. Personally I laughed many many times during this one and am about to watch it again.I do recognise though, that there a flatness to this one. Not sure what it is, think it might be the gold and the bright lighting set which isn't very interesting to the eye. But yes there is a slight flatness here that his other specials don't have.But overall I think this is a solid set from the great man. Few F bombs in here too so... slightly more confrontational than previous sets which I thought were quite tween friendly.",False
17,2,Dr Sebastian Mr Maniscalco,Hegezip,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been a fan since 2014. Went to see him twice live in Montreal. This guy has literally opened up new comical territories for me and as an immigrant married to another immigrant I have always related to his skits to the highest point.But this was NOT it. This felt like some random guy had 2 shots of espresso then swallowed a whole tab of antidepressants and tried to impersonate the ""real"" Sebastian Maniscalco.It was so painful to watch I actually felt bad for the guy. I still respect him so much for everything he's done. But after this one there's gotta be someone around him to tell him that this is so cringe he's going to need to take some time to reflect, enjoy some family time and come back stronger than ever with FRESH content and his usual energy.I legit thought that his lack of enthusiasm was part of a skit and then he was going to ""wake up"" and make a joke about himself or something. But realizing that this was really ""him"", I actually got sad.They say you should never meet your heros. But I'd like to meet him one day and tell him it's not over, there's still time for him to redeem himself after this Mascarado.",False
18,10,Love Sebastian!!,mhasso,n/a,16/08/2025,"He's the best!!! Loved every minute. He has his own style and if you really know people and his style, you will love him. Every comedian does the same thing. They repeat their styles. Bill burr rants all the time. Sebastian makes fun of people and cherishes his family. I love that and so will you. He's great! His kids, wife, parents and siblings are his life. What other comedian would you wanna see?? He's right about Hamilton. Overrated. I mean he's honest. It's great. You also need to watch his podcast. Him and Pete correale are great together! Watch this special. He is a class act. Anyone that doesn't like this special is taking offense to the truth.",False
19,2,Fame Has Gotten To His Head,priscilla-02867,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have always been such a fan! I couldn't wait to watch this special! I literally signed up for Netflix just to watch this. He seemed low energy compared to previous specials. I get the ""old time Vegas"" theme and applaud him for that as it was very classy but it's almost as if he had a cockiness about him. I loved the material but the delivery was very dry and seemed like he was just waiting for moments to make his cool gestures, so he knew he could move on to the next storyline. It honestly seemed like he didn't want to be there or that he felt entitled to get a better reaction from the audience. I'm still a fan but I hope he can try to stay humble.",False
20,4,Tries too hard and still not funny.,gina_gemini,n/a,16/08/2025,"He tries hard, one might say too hard and always have tried too hard but his act just isn't funny. Really never was.His whole act is starting a story, doing some physical stuff and voices and just leaving it for the next one with no real punch lines. Can't remember a single laugh, the most was probably a single chuckle somewhere....
And after all these years does he himself know what exactly he is trying to do? Is it a persona or a poor impersonation? Because it feels a lot like the latter.I still can't watch him and not get reminded of Dice. But that's just the extent of it. Dice was on a whole other level and sadly even after all these years Sebastian has failed to improve his act above an opening act.",False
21,10,It's NOT You Sebastian!,DVK1234,n/a,16/08/2025,"So funny! Of course the woke left here would have something to say about him commenting about the Asian dad, or the foreign bus boys.He got it right about stupid parents bringing their kids to school dressed as furries, my daughter has kids dressed like that in her school. What can you say except the parents must be morons?Talking about his wife in the car, at the restaurant, at Hamilton--pure comedy!Going for hipster coffee with the barista with the belly hole hair? I could totally see that happening and he made it even more hilarious in his description!Going to the public washroom with his prostatic enlarged dad. So funny.Don't listen to the haters. This was funny and people need to lighten up.",False
22,3,How the mighty have fallen,mikey79,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a shame - I'm a huge fan of Maniscalco's earlier work, he was razor sharp in the early part of his career and midway through he developed and added a touch of panache to his comedy and delivery, he was becoming more finessed, more lightning quick, but not at the expense of his comedy...his take on life, and his stories. They were both excellent.I feel now, and with this special, something has changed. Has he been too famous for too long, too rich? He seems more distant from his audience, perplexed by people who aren't like him, moaning about banal occurrences or little quibbles which he can't now turn into a funny story. It ends up sounding just like a middle age man whining for the sake of it. He also looks in terrible shape, like any kind of movement on his part would set him off on a burping fit weirdly. He even touches upon it during the stand up that he's out of shape.Hopefully this is a minor blip but I guess it shows nobody stays funny forever, as their circumstances change they change as people and lose what made them hilarious in the first place.",False
23,9,Entertaining,fambs,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have watched all his specials and seen him in person and he never disappoints. I always watch them with my dad, mom and siblings and we laugh so hard! Yes, he tells stories, but they are relatable to my life and family and nowadays, I think a lot of people will be able to relate to it. Our country is too PC and comedians need to be able to tell jokes without constant worrying about the cancel culture out there.At some points we were crying we were laughing so hard.Thank you Sebastian for putting together a great special we will watch again. Your comedy helps relieve the stress of the day!",False
24,1,I'm still waiting for the punch line,marycompagno,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm I the only one that feels he's just not funny.The restaurant opening went know where.The lion joke was ridiculously not funny. .
I'm at a lose as to who is advising him this is good material.The dropping his kids off at school had no point of comedy.The part of his kid taking his shirt off?Was there a point to this?He needs to go back to his roots.Talking about his wife and kids doesn't hit the mark.Talking about his Italian father and family is hysterical.Maybe the Italian heritage is what I was down too but this material is a hard watch. Absolutely not one launch cane from a room full of people at my house.He's material during Covid lockdown was getting old.I hope his next special is better.",False
25,2,Tell me you want to use racial slurs without telling me you want to use racial slurs,danny-altered-natives,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a first review outside of movies for me. I absolutely love stand up comedy and have watched previous shows of his, and this one was by far the worst of his already mediocre turns. It was how I imagine you would write if you were invited to perform for someone like Donald Trump, with the crowd pleasers being the lamenting of the often annoying liberal white call to question every past poor treatment of any non-white race or group by being outraged on behalf of whatever group or race.Sebastian Maniscalco freely admits he's dumb, which shows when his whoops and applause are all from poor jokes which platform his questionable views on any group beneath or outside his race or age group. Sebastian clearly yearns for a world where racial slurs are still a currency deemed harmless by the user and questions progression embarrassingly like a man twice his age. I never laughed once sadly, placing him in the same pile of non-funny terrible comedians, drawing from the likes of Iliza Shlesinger (reverting to stupid voices for laughs), Amy Schumer and Hannah Gadsby (if she were a miserable white man). Every topic in this show is from the viewpoint of an overly aged 50 year old man, lambasting anything that is and has threatened white male control and masculinity. From hipster coffee, covid masks, kindergarten teachers, being an alpha male dad who doesn't do goo goo voices with his kid because he's a real man to his boringly unfunny family stories, there was absolutely nothing funny or amusing about this show.I hate not laughing when the purpose is to laugh, this show is on par with a terrible sexual experience that just leaves you shocked, confused or dissatisfied, where hours after you question, why did that happen?",True

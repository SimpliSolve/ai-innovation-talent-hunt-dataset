1,8,A real Phenomenon...,Thanos_Alfie,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Money Heist: The Phenomenon"" is a Documentary in which we watch how ""Money Heist"" became so popular around the world and the influence that had on people and in their lives. There are also some backstage scenes and some beautiful interviews.I enjoyed this documentary because it contained plenty of information regarding the way that ""Money Heist"" followed from its start until the end of the fourth season. It also contained some very good interviews of the cast, something that I found very interesting since you could see and observe the main characters of the series talking about it and their feelings. The direction which was made by Luis Alfaro and Pablo Lejarreta was simply amazing and they presented very well both the actors/actresses of the series and the explained some parts of the plot. Finally, I have to say that ""Money Heist: The Phenomenon"" is a nice documentary and I highly recommend it to any ""Money Heist"" fan but I advise you to watch after finishing the series and not prior.",False
2,8,Nice To see all the work that we cant see in the final result,AvionPrince16,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed this movie about Money Heist Or la Casa De Papel , because we can see all the struggle of the producers , the writers , the actors , the visual effect supervisor and more of them struggle to bring these images that we see in the final result . All Their work have some problem and they try to resolve them in a short amount of time . I enjoyed to see that , it looked more authentic and we can see thats not easy to do a TV Show like this :always a problem that appear even if we don t expect it . The Movie talk also about the different part of The TV Show : the symbol, the songs , the names , the plot , the characters and their behavior , the different locations . Very interesting and informative about the process of la Casa De Papel.",False
3,7,Want more episodes,sasugandhi,n/a,16/08/2025,"I want to see , how more episodes were made and phenomenon behind it and small stories behind the sets, it was fun .",False
4,9,From Earth to Sky,umarali30,n/a,16/08/2025,"As money heist fan it was inevitable to watch this documentary and not only I'm amazed by the story but also got to know about the characters and their personalities.
Basically it tells you about the show and how it was a failed TV series and after 3 season the show was over and everyone went back to their normal lives. Also, you'll be able to see behind the scenes footage of filming some famous scenes of the show.
When Netflix bought this show they didn't know that it will become a 'phenomenon' and they just added in to their list without any advertisment because it was k flop show in Spain. Then suddenly it became popular and hundreds of thousands of people started to watch the series and hence it became most watched Spanish TV series outside the Spain.
According to characters such as Professor, Berlin, Denver, lisbon and so on, they had a few thousand followers on social media and suddenly they were getting hundreds of thousands followers per hour. Jamie lorente Lopez aka Denver has now approximately 12 million followers on Instagram. With the success their lives were changed. Similarly very interesting stories from the professor, Berlin and others about interaction with the fans and how they're so grateful for the success they got suddenly. Making of different famous scenes is also very cool. Also, you'll see about the impact of this series around the world whether it is a protest or any celebration. How it has become a symbol of resistance.",False
5,10,An Inside Look at a World Wide Phenomenon,pweston-64845,n/a,16/08/2025,"No, the series does not have Emmy award winning actors. However there is a big ""YES!"" for this documentary showing us when these unknown actors became totally immersed in their either redeeming, or unredeeming, characters, big commitment, and big change happened. Which, in an equally big turn, brought them from total obscurity, to world wide - and unexpected - recognition.I fell in love with this addicting series because even the worst situation, or character, was not all bad. It was the slow unravelling to the dark, or even light side, that made my attraction to the series even more compelling. The writers made the situations unique, and the characters 'flawfully' human. Which made it all the more identifiable, as it is colorfullly explained by all, in the documentary.This series, and even this documentary, gave me a new appreciation for problem handling, and how to spend ""quality time"", with not so quality people, and unsavory politics...There are real movements, against all kinds of oppression, that the lives of these fictional characters have influenced. We learn, in the documentary, that not only the cast, crew, and actors, but people from everywhere have, and are being changed, because of the imaginative, and heartfelt writing and directing (and let's not forget producing) from this emotionally charged series.This documentary will show you how it all started, and the even more addictive ""behind the scenes"" looks that will help lock you into to each character, and storyline, even more.Thanks to all of the the writers, producers, and actors (on Netflix, and everywhere) who continually keep righting wrongs, and publishing writes, that help keep us emotionally involved - and motivated - while ""self isolating"" in this boring interlude, of what is supposed to be our ""active lives"" .",False

8,10,Amazing series that really surprised me!,josefsnabb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh boy!! I am picky regarding series and I was a bit sceptic about this one but boy this blew my mind! This is one of the best I've ever seen, how can this not be more hyped? The creative and intelligent story is so well thought through, the excitement and tension is crazy good. The writers behind this plot is as genius as the smart minds described in the show.There is a perfect balance between high pace excitement and slow scenes. Neatly jumping between past and present, seamlessly connecting the dots. You constantly get surprised of how you think things are. You get to know a high number of interesting characters in depth, all amazingly well acted. You will for sure be glued to this show, wanting to know the end, but at the same time not wanting it to end.This is one of very few series I award a rating of 10.",False
9,1,The irony of the storyline,Shrekery,n/a,16/08/2025,"So what can be ironic about a TV show that generally is about fighting injustice, inequity, and oppression? It is that the actors recently showed in a TV interview with an Israeli TV channel and sweet-talked about Israel that commits numerous crimes against humanity on daily basis, also praised the TV show Fauda, that beautifies the Israeli crimes committed in the West Bank!In short, this is a show against injustice that supports injustice :) !",False

15,10,A-W-E-S-O-M-E,kartikku-78353,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rating (10 out of 10)
The best show I've ever seen. Everyone must watch this. JUST MASTER PIECE, SUPERB, MAGNIFICENT, SPECTACULAR, Unbelievably great show deserving of every award available. Character development, credibility, direction, sets, all so well done. Supporting casts excellent. Never have I come across such a MASTERPIECE!!! Worldwide acclaim is well deserved. Highly engaging thriller ""Money heist "" is another brilliant masterstroke from Netflix .Stellar cast is most important part of this amazing edge of seat thriller , kudos to director and screenplay writer for creating an impeccable gripping thriller which gets more intense by every season passed . Cinematography , editing , performance , direction , music , action sequences everything is amazing. I think it's the first show where the characters are so accurate and represent so well real-life humans. You'll see, the writers created people with atrocious flaws but with beautiful qualities, which are actually how people are. In Money Heist, there's no good or bad guys. Everyone is everyone and you get to see it. You'll be surprised by how a mean and selfless character is actually on your top list. I thoroughly enjoyed each episode I have seen up through season 4. I liked every character, even the ones with minor roles. I did not have a favorite. The characters are so beautifully portrayed that you can feel their emotions, you'll laugh with them, cry with them, lose your mind ,be sacred , be ruthless and at the end fall in love. It is one of the best TV series ever made.",False

19,1,I don't mind a poorly made movie if the storyline is Good,robhingston,n/a,16/08/2025,"The only thing this movie seems to have is a strong soundtrack,
Other than that you're looking at very amateur actors, with a poor storyline, hard to believe that Netflix is entertaining this",False
20,1,Absolute Garbage,imaltsev,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just wow.Millennials will love this.Hate the fact that this has been promoted so much on Streaming platforms, not sure what happened but this has put me off from watching anymore Spanish movies.",False

23,1,The worst actors,e_vision,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI have never seen such bad acting all the occasions that happen are expected if you really want to watch something sophisticated and not naive like this better watch prison break if you haven't watched it yet,True
24,1,Not Even Remotely Plausible,asfhgwt-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLet's think about a few issues in just the first episode:1. The dubbing and dialog are awful.2. There are too many people (crooks) involved in the heist. Someone in the team is bound to do something dumb or gripe about something.3. Female lead does do something dumb -- walks too far away from the mint's door and the police start shooting before she can get back inside. Worse, she shoots back, as do her pals, wounding two policemen and losing their ""Robin Hood status.""
4. Forty or so episodes is far too long for the premise.5. The safecracker guy somehow knows exactly where to blowtorch a small square in a million-dollar(?) bank safe -- and simply turn a gear to make it open!6. The safe was practically empty, except for one pallet of paper Euros.7. As usual in caper films these days, it's super-easy to break into any company's computer system, and have access to every camera, etc.8. Equally common, there's always one member of the thieves who oversees all his cronies from afar.9. Some of the crooks took their masks off before all the people in the mint were blindfolded. Oddly, the blindfolds have white crosses sewn onto them.10. There was at least one bed in the mint.11. Female lead can't resist and actually sleeps with twerpy kid 12 years younger, who proposes marriage to her.12. At least one of the mint employees/patrons would panic immediately and have to be subdued. Didn't happen.13. The mint apparently doesn't have any cameras in the place, since the team takes their masks off once the employees/patrons were blindfolded.",True
25,4,Season 5 is quite boring - disappointed,mary_mads,n/a,16/08/2025,Nothing really happens until the last episode. A lot of repetition and scenes reprised. Poor dialogues. Very disappointed compared to the beginning of the series.,False

1,10,Overwhelming,martinaframmartino,n/a,16/08/2025,"The most amazing show I've ever seen. In GIFT skating, music, dance, plays of light and storytelling, all of the highest level, are combined to create a whole that is much more than the sum of the individual parts, and which is unprecedented in history. The emotional impact is very strong, both for the beauty of the whole and for its depth, because the story told is at the same time the story of the protagonist and that of each of the spectators. GIFT is a new form of art, capable of taking your breath away and which deserves to be relived over and over again, to better appreciate the perfection with which every detail has been taken care of and to relive an emotional journey that digs deep in the human soul crossing joy and pain, to finally arrive at that light to which we all aspire.",False
2,10,Revolutionized Figure Skating Ice Shows,debruhlee,n/a,16/08/2025,"GIFT is a genre itself, it's a beyond a figure skating ice show in every aspect: Never an ice show before could tell a complete story to touch people's heart so deeply, it feels personal although it's performed in front of 35k live audience; The music, the stage and lighting were not only exceeding any previous ice show' level, but also didn't take away the main attention, which is Yuzuru's performance himself, the perfect balance. Tbh, I think if Sapporo wins the 2030 winter Olympics's bid, they should invite Yuzuru Hanyu to direct the opening ceremony. On the skating side: Yuzuru has performed 7 quads, 6 triple axels, skated the 2 hours ice show all by himself; the successful redemption to Beijing Olympics' short program again showed his courage and never ending forward moving spirit. Yuzuru, thank you so much for the GIFT you brought to the world!",False
3,10,"An immersive, fascinating dive into Yuzuru Hanyu's insane world",teajjeje,n/a,16/08/2025,"Look, the show has a live orchestra, band, dancers, stage direction and coordination by experts in the field, etc, so it looks and sounds gorgeous. It's already worth watching for this alone. But.Above all else, it's Yuzuru Hanyu delivering his signature quality skates-beyond that, each program connects together in a stream of consciousness that transports you into his world and guides you gently through it.It made me realize that the Yuzuru we saw in competition was such a small glimpse of his talents.Of course he can skate and he skates beautifully as ever. He brings a competition level program just before the midway point and it's as heart-pounding as ever to watch it live not knowing how it'd go and praying for the best. He's insane for doing this, by the way.But he's also an excellent artist, storyteller, narrator, and none of this could ever hope to be judged or presented properly in any of the years we've seen him. Here, I think we finally get the true inkling of what he's capable of.All of these talents for his skating, to take the presentation of his skating to greater heights by weaving a beautiful and haunting narrative of his journey, struggles, and redemption. And through it all, his joy for skating is the most evident. Maybe he even lost sight of it once, on the journey to get here, but he reclaims it anew. The dome packed full is a beautiful sea of lights and the ice loves him back.GIFT is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It's got the spectacle and grandeur of Tokyo Dome and the terrifying ephemeralness of a top athlete in his prime whose presence shines brighter than any flashy lighting you could cast on him, and it's truly made for this place and this one night.Although there were regrets in the past, although he learned that regrets may be inevitable, he keeps moving forward everyday.I never imagined an ice show could be like this and I still think he's insane. I also haven't moved on from this show since it happened almost a week ago, so maybe I'm becoming a bit insane, too.",False
4,10,Beyond Expectation,liasari-74192,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have never watched any ice shows before I meet Yuzuru Hanyu. I watched his other ice shows before I watched this. This one is different. Truly a genre of it's own. I didn't expect this from an ice show. It's not only an ice show. It's a story about human journey. It is his journey. But, probably almost every person feels what he tells in the monologue. It's just we respond differently. His monologue really captures me inside his story.The orchestra, the lighting, the rink, they all are very beautiful. They are even better from his previous ice shows. But, Yuzuru still be able to make himself as the center of attention. His stamina, incredible. His skating, it's not supposed to be mention anymore how beautiful it is.",False
5,10,Yuzuru has proved to the world that he goes way beyond being a figure skater,shirleyyi,n/a,16/08/2025,"To those who don't understand why Yuzuru is THE BEST figure skater, go watch GIFT. Who else, professional or amatour, can put on 12 performances with such high quality in two and a half hours? If that's not enough, listen to his story told with 100% honesty.To those who are already a Yuzu fan, this would be a chance for you to fall in love with him again. He is still in his prime, with 4 programs and a 6 minute practice - he can still do Rondo with perfection, with every jump landing so beautifully and that redemption 4s. This is the sweetest revenge in the world!To those who are curious as to what Yuzu has done, he doesn't only perform, he has single-handedly planned and produced the show, and has had a moving, soul-touching story told, and has shown the world what he went through - his vulnerability, his weakness, his struggle, his fight, his redemption, and his trust in the light, in the fans who really care, who take time to help him to heal.This is a legendary ice show; none comes close and none will. Yuzuru Hanyu is a genius and wherever he puts his heart in, he succeeds. He is an phenonmenal athlete who is exceptionally smart. With his brain, his bravery, his great execution, I can't even start to predict what a world he will lead us into in the future! GIFT is only a start!!!! Love from China!",False
6,10,Probably the very best show ever,stephlim-90899,n/a,16/08/2025,"GIFT exceeded the boundary of an ice show, the combination of sports and art have redefined what ice show could be. The mesmerising visual effect and projection mapping on ice were stunning and perfectly done. The sound effects are amazing too, there's no delay and you can literally hear every musical instrument during the show. Above all, Yuzuru Hanyu's figure skating is out of the world. He always deliver, his figure skating brought audience to the world only he can reach, he upgraded what figure skating could be, precise execution of difficult elements & dancing on ice. You could watch this show tirelessly for more than 5 times and still discover new things. The story was connected with narrations and figure skating, he performed with figure skating, bringing a world view and never bore you for a single second. What a wonderful show, what a wonderful performance. GIFT is probably one of the greatest creation you could ever imagined, until the next self-produced solo dome show, I believe no one but Hanyu Yuzuru could surpass Hanyu Yuzuru.",False
7,10,A heart-touching story.,kirishimaaira,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is a masterpiece. The programs, along with the costumes, music and lightnings and the stages are aesthetically beautiful with all the orchestra, band and side dancers.But what I love the most is the story he tells with the show. As someone has said, watching the show feels like flipping through someone's personal diary/journal where he expresses his internal struggles. It follows the story of the MC as he struggles with existential crisis, trying to deal with his loneliness, trying to accept the support from people. It was beautiful watching how the main character finally accepts himself as a person and accepts the light he once believed he doesn't deserve with open arms. The directing by MIKIKO and acting and narration by Yuzu himself is beautiful and couldn't be better.",False
8,10,Groundbreaking innovation in entertainment,paola-85240,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gift is primarily a showcase of Yuzuru Hanyu's outstanding skating programmes. The innovation comes with the concepts of story telling through the medium of beautiful narrative prose, animated sequences, collaboration with top performance artists, musicians and lighting effects / projection mapping and of course all presented by Hanyu himself. Each of the stories is exquisitely wrought. Combining all of these performance elements gives the viewer of Gift a distinct and unique perspective and experience, with the spectator fully involved and very emotionally invested in the performance. The entire event is a magical experience from the genius mind of Yuzuru Hanyu, performer, creative talent, producer, director. All accolades and praises are fully deserved.",False
9,10,Figure skating elevated to status of performing arts,wintekeastsky,n/a,16/08/2025,"GIFT is an ice show like no other. The content is delivered as a unified story where ice skating, live music (Tokyo Philharmonic and GIFT special band), visual effects and dance are combined to present a deep introspection on the theme of aloneness and pursuing dreams. GIFT is a fully immersive experience where the viewer can interpret the meaning of the images, narration, and ice skating programs from different viewpoints. Hanyu is the solo skater performing with the technical quality and expressiveness that has characterized his career. In GIFT (where he is also the producer), Hanyu creates a new genre of sports as performing arts.",False

11,10,A once-in-a-century ice show created by a once-in-a-century athlete,sheena-18527,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yuzuru Hanyu has had a storied career as a competitive figure skater but the ice shows that Hanyu has created as a professional figure skater show that his competitive career is just the tip of the iceberg for this legendary athlete. Yuzuru Hanyu's GIFT seamlessly blends figure skating and performing arts to create a genre-defying ice show of jaw-dropping brilliance.Hanyu collaborated with some of the biggest names in Japan's arts industry -Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, MIKIKO, Satoshi Takebe, Rhizomatiks - to create a visual and musical masterpiece at the mecca of Japanese sports and entertainment - Tokyo Dome.GIFT is an extraordinary feat of athleticism- a solo ice show (unheard of before Hanyu decided it was possible) with 12 programmes skated with Hanyu's inimitable style and technical virtuosity. It is a show that never loses its soul. At its heart, GIFT is a poignant story about hope and dreams, loneliness and despair, courage and love.GIFT gives us a glimpse of the creative and artistic genius of Yuzuru Hanyu. It is a show that makes you feel that even greater heights await the GOAT of figure skating. The dragon who had been trapped in a well has broken free of his shackles and is soaring freely into the sky.",False
12,10,An absolute masterpiece that transports viewers into a realm of pure enchantment.,annatang-60919,n/a,16/08/2025,"This legendary one-man ice show showcases Hanyu's exceptional talent as he effortlessly weaves a captivating narrative reflecting on his own journey that resonates with people from all walks of life. Through his mesmerizing performance, he ignites hope, dreams, and courage within the hearts of his audience, leaving them spellbound and inspired. The show's live music by Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, the exquisite lighting effects and impeccable production values elevate it to a realm beyond imagination, creating a visually stunning spectacle that leaves you awestruck.

13,10,I was blessed to be there,wlanporn,n/a,16/08/2025,It is a show that I will never forget for the rest of my life. I'm his fan. Be able to join his solo ice show in person at Tokyo dome was a bless. His skating is in another level. It was so impressive as always. He skated so many programs and some new programs that was created for this show. The production is really good. Yuzu told his life story there. Other than his skating that you will enjoy for the entire show you will also see his acting which I must say he did a great job really. He should try to act more 😊. I will definitely watch it again and I wanna see behind the scene and interview too.,False
14,10,A show that you have to watch at least once in your life,roroellies,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ice shows usually are all about having fun, an entertainment for those who enjoy watching figure skatings. However, GIFT is an ice story, so it's like watching a movie, a musical show and also attending a very huge group therapist all at once. It has all the required elements to make it an unforgetable and ever lasting show that will left a trace in my life forever. All the monologues, the programs, the musics, carry the viewers to our deepest state of mind. The theme of loneliness and struggle of finding the meaning of life, which a lot of us experience, accompanied by beautiful skatings and musics, made me sheds tears throughout the shows. Yuzuru is the bravest person I have ever known, barring his souls like that in front of thousands people, taking us to the deepest part of himself as well as ours. This is why Gift will always be ""the friend and the place to come back to"" as stated by Yuzuru, esp for people like me who also struggling with loneliness.I'm so thankful to Yuzuru, the genious producer, who created the world of GIFT for his fans. Standing ovations too for the creative director MIKIKO-sensei, the music director Takebe-san, THEE Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, and all party involved. GIFT is a MUST WATCH, even for those who are not interested with figure skatings, this show is like one of those movies you have to watch at least once in your life.",False
15,10,Super star,linlin-42595,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to get tickets last month to see GIFT at the Tokyo Dome, and GIFT was the greatest ice show in the history of figure skating! I was sooo moved and my heart was shaking. Yuzuru Hanyu is a one and only superstar. He was by far the shining star in the packed hall. You must see the fast dance number he choreographed himself in the middle of the show! It was so sharp, and he looked so cool like a K-pop star, I was impressed. And the ""Let Me Entertain You"" before that, I thought he was a rock star!! It was really exciting! He is the only person in the world who can dance so cool on the rink. He also teamed up with MIKIKO, Japan's best director. The video is also stunningly beautiful, and the fusion of Yuzuru Hanyu and the images is wonderful, so don't miss it.",False
16,10,"analysis of GIFT from a Chinese writer, majoring in films",yuzupooh1207111,n/a,16/08/2025,"There has never been an ice performance, which has a rigorous play structure to show the personal theme. I cried several times when I watched it. As a person who studied movies, in the era when the masters withered and the movies were dead, GIFT comforted me deeply. I really want to pack it for Cannes Film Festival and for all the best directors in the world, letting them all have a look at this real work of art. It is natural, sincere and natural.Before GIFT, all ice shows were actually platter ice shows. That is, this program has little to do with that program, and does not constitute a narrative as a whole. This form is also an extension of the competition program.Prologue produced by yuzu is the predecessor of GIFT, which is a pre version that is not yet fully mature, but it also generally has the concept of structure, that is, trying to string the program together organically with VCR, but the inside is relatively loose. This is also the reason why we can't understand ""Final Dream"" in Prologue, but we fully understand it in GIFT.Final Dream, like all the programs in GIFT, is part of the big narrative structure. Yuzu also mentioned in the interview of Prologue that ""Final Dream"" may not be a program alone, but it is OK to present it as a whole.I can't understand those who have watched GIFT, especially those watching GIFT live, can still miss competitive events. In my opinion, the ice show of GIFT has directly overturned the century-old foundation of ISU, and since then the figure skating competition has lost all its imagination.Because it is impossible for any other player to make such a thing, at least within a hundred years, which is not exactly a matter of visual effects. This is a work of a truly passionate soul that uses exquisite artistic language. This is a work that only Yuzuru Hanyu can do, and NO OTHERS can do it. To be honest, how much the artists who cooperated with him love him can be so unified and touching.Some people compare GIFT with the opening ceremony of Beijing2022. These two can't be compared. Let me put it this way, the opening ceremony of Beijing2022 was an excellent work, and GIFT will be a masterpiece. It has touching beauty and tremor.GIFT has completely surpassed sports and is a truly mature work of art.Through GIFT, we witness a great athlete and an outstanding artist. The artist here is a noun, not a rhetoric. It's different from ""This game is really art"". What Yuzuru Hanyu did was the real art.Human miracle.Figure skating is not at the same level as yuzu. It was figure skating that was out of yuzu's league.Yuzuru Hanyu is still too underrated.",False
17,10,GIFT is magical,e_p-22449,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is seriously astounding. The lighting, projections, music, costumes, and of course the skating by the GOAT of the sport... all incredible. It's an emotional roller-coaster - ethereal and delicate one minute, exciting and loud the next. Yuzuru weaves his poetic musings throughout the show in the form of dialogue videos and animations, bringing new depth to well-loved programs and creating a beautiful and heartbreaking 'storybook'. His skating is as dynamic as ever, and with the stage crew, he creates a world that draws the audience in from the explosive opening. GIFT was created with immeasurable passion, love, talent and care.",False
18,10,"Genius, Best Show Ever",pianistliz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not only the best ice show ever produced, but one of the best shows in any medium I've ever seen, combining orchestra, rock band, interpretive dancers, projection mapping, special effects like fog and fire, and cinematography and anime-style animation sequences. Oh, and figure skating by the best skater in history. All bound together flawlessly by a poetic story that examines the core of why we humans do what we do, the value of connection, and is all based on Yuzuru Hanyu's own feelings and experiences. If you have never watched figure skating before, watch this. There is truly something for everyone, but be careful, watch Gift and you may find yourself subsequently binging all Yuzuru Hanyu's performances on YouTube and turn into a hardcore figure skating fan.",False
19,10,GIFT is Treasure,iceyfb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Since December 5th, when I knew he was going to give us this GIFT. I have been looking forward to this magnificent show. It is world-renowned and unprecedented. I couldn't stop crying and cheering when I saw it on the big screen in Hong Kong. He had done it. We had seen a figure skating show that no one else had ever seen it before. Even until now, I will go to the aftertaste of it every day and feel the shock brought to me. Each of the 12 programs has Yuzuru Hanyu's unique style. But either way is his inner monologue and messages to us. It's not just his fans who can feel the emotion, but anyone, who knows him or doesn't know him, will be moved by his performances. Yuzu created a new miracle for us, let us see another form of figure skating, it's Yuzuru Hanyu's figure skating, from which we can feel his real and unreserved spiritual world. He trusts and cherish us so much. We will continue to look forward to his greater miracle with this kind of cherish! Of course, this performance is worthy of immortality. I will cherish this precious GIFT as a treasure forever!",False
20,10,The greatest of all time,duongbichly,n/a,16/08/2025,"GIFT is magical, stunning, beautiful, heart wrenching, soul soothing. From the GOAT of figure skating, a show only Hanyu can do. It made me smile. It made me cry. It made my heart ache. It gently stroking my soul with a feathery touch that sent me to the meadow if heaven. It contains so much humanity and courage. Who else has the bravery to perform Rondo in front of 35k audience, and on live streaming, knowing just one mistake would damn his career to hell? Only Hanyu has that courage. A magnificent show, both in the art if story telling and in skating. Hanyu has proved yet again, that he was and still is the best male skater this sport has ever seen.",False
21,10,"GROUNDBREAKING, GREATEST HISTORY EVER MADE ON ICE",suvechssa,n/a,16/08/2025,"GIFT is the most versatile, spectacular & the biggest historical event in the world of figure skating. Not just figure skating, Yuzuru Hanyu created something unprecedented & extraordinary in terms of art. From the production to the story telling, every little detail was created so precisely. From Live music played by a full Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra to every program, stunning lighting & visualization, everything is brilliant. It is something that has never been done before & Yuzuru Hanyu showed a world of figure skating that is beyond the realm of anyone's imagination.

22,10,Creating a new genre,OodlesoDoodles,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yuzuru Hanyu has already proven himself to be an excellent skater and performer. With GIFT he's now proven himself to be an artist. The combination of skating, writing, live music, dance, and projection mapping creates an entirely unique experience that only someone of his talent could pull off. I was in awe from beginning to end. The overall story was deeply moving and emotionally affecting. Normal ice shows are shallow cheesy fun but this show had me feeling anxiety, grief, serenity, joy, and awe.I also want to add, I have some light sensitivity and the dance section after LMEY is sometimes a bit triggering for me, so be careful or skip if that's an issue for you.",False
23,10,A show like no other!,anggriyaniasri,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the best show I ever seen in my whole life. The music, story, skating programe, costume, flow, lighting, and every thing about it is so well thought, planned, and executed. I can't wait to see another show by Yuzuru Hanyu. The show is not only for those who enjoy figure skating or Yuzuru Hanyu fans, it's for everyone who enjoy great performance executed in a very high level way. A must see!You can not categorize it just as an ice show because it offers much more than that. Live music from Tokyo Philharmonic, special live band for gift. Amazing lighting works that you can compare it to an Olympic opening show... Very extravagant to the tiny little details. Just watch it and you will see it with your own eyes.",False
24,10,An unprecedented event in figure skating history,ngochanedu,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show involved top tier figures in production such as well-known director MIKIKO and experienced music director TAKEBE, especially the biggest star of the Okympics - Yuzuru Hanyu. The stories were told by Hanyu himselves. Each part was connected with each other fluently and appropriately. Hanyu presented charming, meaningful programs which were taylored made to fit the senses that Hanyu would like to convey. Hanyu is not only talented in skating skills but he also possesses the abilities to make his programs more interesting and memoriable through various facial expressions. Hanyu self produced this show which is far beyond his fans' expectations.",False
25,10,I can't contain my love for this man,sophroome,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yuzuru Hanyu proves yet again that he is the greatest figure skater of all time, the greatest athlete of all time, and in my opinion the greatest artist of all time. The way he pursues his ideal figure skating, becoming truer to himself and his skating, is inspirational. I am in awe of him as a person, his attitude towards life/the world/his passion is admirable. Retiring is the best thing Yuzuru could have done, he's free from the underscoring, the mistreatment and the doubt that came with it. We can see him shine brighter and brighter, improving day by day, truly touching the hearts of anyone who watches him. The way he makes his fans feel, no one can replicate that. The honesty, the beauty, the love, the elegance, the emotion, it all comes into one feeling that only he can invoke in you. I always wonder, 'how could a person like him exist?', and now, with GIFT, he's blown me away yet again. The storytelling, the lighting, the graphics, the live orchestra, it all comes together and compliments his skating perfectly to immerse you in his world, in his story, it all feels so honest, so raw. I will be rewatching GIFT time and time again, and I can't wait for what he does next.",False

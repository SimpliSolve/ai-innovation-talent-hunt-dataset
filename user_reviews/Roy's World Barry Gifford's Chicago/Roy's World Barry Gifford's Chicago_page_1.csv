1,10,Beautiful film,farglow-47149,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally watched this and I loved it so much. The archival footage. The jazz. The incredible prose and narration. I felt transported to a place I've never been and a time I never lived through.The film creates a beautiful atmosphere and tone that feels so true to the hypnotic writing and memories shared by Gifford. It creates a real sense of place and feels like a looking glass into the world of the past, that world being both Gifford's personal story and also the city of Chicago itself.In a time when we are oversaturated with documentaries on all the various streaming services, this stands out as a true work of art.Not just for fans of Barry Gifford but if you are a fan, this is absolutely a must-watch.",False

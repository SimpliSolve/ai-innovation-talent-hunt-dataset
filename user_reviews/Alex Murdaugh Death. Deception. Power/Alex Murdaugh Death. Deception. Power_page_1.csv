1,7,Things are not always as they appear,pmaynard,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is all about Southern justice and southern power. Alex Murdaugh is not alone when it comes to corruption here in the south. My question is why would any insurance payout check go to the lawyer? Don't think he is the only one that has done this either. This documentary is no better or worse but the opinions are projected as facts. Like the opioid use. We are all different when it comes to tolerance and yes he can ingest enough pills that would make another person overdose. And you would never know he had taken them. That is a fact. Also the justice system here is prejudice and discriminatory. This is a fact We are not all equal when it comes to being equal in the eyes of the law. It matters how much money you have ,the power you have, and who you know. I live in the lowcountry and it does matter. When laws can be ammended solely to protect those in power for their immoral and unethical behavior without any consequences, this is unacceptable. And I don't believe Alex killed his wife or son. This was about Paul and what I'd call a act of southern justice by those who knew he'd get off. This is what happens when our court system run by those with power will not do the right thing. I don't believe Mallorys family was involved nor her boyfriend but a group that gave the Murdaughs a swift sentence of southern justice. And then it gave those in power the opportunity to pin him to the wall for the embarrassing acts he did do., the accusations were just an added bonus. I am in no way siding with him but this was an opportunity to put Hampton County on the entertainment media map. Crime does pay and it oays well. And things are not always as they appear. Those films and thos documentary either censored or has no clue of the secrets that the law enforcement and South Carolina's legal systems power and corruption. Things are not always as they appear. I could write a book on it but I might have to pay the price. The documentary portrayed the Murdaughs as though they were the only and most powerful corrupt law firm family in the south. Ridiculous!",True
2,4,first and foremost...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"Id like to say that the way oxygene is treating this case is close to murder of reputation, there are next to none statements from legal prosecuters nor sheriff's or police departments. Also its a case that hasnt been thouroughly treated in the justice system yet, and i feel that the head investing journalist in this oxygene special loves to shine like a sun on the tv, and loves to spin the wheel of the devil of intricacy and enshroudment thats coming close to the border of impertinence. So dont take your mouth too full of whats the'' facts'' in this case, they shouldve awaited the finish of the planned trials and make their investigative conclusions after that.Having seen this soap opera of classic south carolinan aristocracy ruling and tampering its neighbourhood with good/rotten deeds with all kinds of damage done with or without the help of...you name it... i may say that it is very suspicious acts done, and there maybe something within the heresays and clues, i hope a sequel will come that may indicate that they were true in their speculations, im just so grumpy and old a man that has learned the competence of patience and not squeeling out loud that this is the killer without doupt when the doupt are still there.Watch it and think a little ,is this good true crime journalism?",False

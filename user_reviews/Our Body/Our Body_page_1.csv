1,8,Worthwhile Documentary to Watch,jbondono,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a really great documentary of health care workers and their patients in a gynecology hospital during Covid as they dealt with abortion, gender transition, help with pregnancy, IVF, natural childbirth, cesarian birth of twins, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and menopause, among other things.The part about IVF was particularly enlightening to me, and the births were very emotional, as was the last segment in the film about a different subject.Several doctors are followed through multiple patients, and at the end of the film the narration expounds that each patient has only one story, omitting the fact that each doctor and nurse has multiple patients day after day, making them true heroes.Available now (March 2024) on CriterionChannel, I recommend this highly.",False

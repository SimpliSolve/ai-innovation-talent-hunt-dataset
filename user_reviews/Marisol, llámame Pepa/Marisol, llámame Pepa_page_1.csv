1,6,An emotional and memorable documentary about the former child prodigy who later became Pepa Flores.,ma-cortes,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary that describes Marisol and Pepa Flores like never before. Documentary on the life of iconic Spanish singer/model/film super-star, Marisol. Her career as Pepa Flores was restarted once she broke free from her perceived ""child star"" Franco era image. Through women who feel represented by the artist, we discover Pepa Flores, who has remained hidden in the shadow of the figure of Marisol. Everyone knows Marisol, but few know Pepa Flores, a woman who decided to turn off the spotlight of fame in 1985, when she was only 37 years old. Until then, her image was a constant on the screens, on the covers of magazines, an overexposure that together with her sudden de-attraction from show-business turned her into a myth. The documentary analyses her impact on society from becoming an image promoted, exemplified and idolized by Francoism to becoming a figure also directed by her then husband, as an unwavering follower of communism and Trotskyism, and participant in all the ultra-leftist parties that were common at the time.In order to tell us who Pepa Flores was and analyse her impact on society, the documentary uses unpublished archive material and interviews with people close to the actress. Like her sister Vicky Flores, the dancer Cristina Hoyos, producer Enrique Cerezo, director Fernando Méndez-Leite to politicians like Esperanza Aguirre, Cristina Almeida and to interviews with people who have been influenced by her, such as the writer Elvira Lindo or the singer Amaia.¨Marisol, llámame Pepa¨(2024) also made a broad review of her life, which in summary is as follows: Marisol was an appealing Spanish actress and singer .

1,8,F the potato farmer,mustangguy3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very informative documentary, shows how it will take a collective effort to stop these ""murder Hornets.
Oh and that potato farmer is a complete d-bag.",False
2,8,Fascinating...terrifying.,reichjon-23828,n/a,16/08/2025,"First, I'm going to just agree with a couple of the other reviewers, that potato farmer is a colossal piece of shhh... Some people are just born to suck.Other than that, though, this documentary was a blast to watch. Informative, interesting, and even a little freaky (I found myself a tad jumpy at the end of the film).I don't have much faith that we can eradicate all of the giant hornets, but I do hope we can find ways of protecting the world's honeybees, not only from the hornets, but from the many other things causing them to die off; they're more crucial to the planet than a lot of people realize, and it would be a shame to lose them entirely.Anyway, check out this documentary, it's a great way to pass some time during a pandemic. And stay safe, everybody!",False
3,7,Scary! And lots of personalities,flurbinflarbin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Truly horrifying creatures. Just when we have enough to worry about, huh? And the bees are already suffering from chemicals...
Very interesting documentary!",False
4,7,Important message clarion call for community effort,justin-mulvey,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show identifies the problem, but more importantly, shows you how you can help. The documentary is well made. There is one religious bee keeper who can't seem to decide if these bees are god's plan or ... not god's plan... or part of gods greater plan. There is also some useful science.",False

7,5,"Good doc, but the score is too loud",Mykle_Ykle,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a fun, entertaining and informative documentary, but it's score is overkill and too loud. It's a bit anxiety inducing because of the volume. Otherwise it's a good score resembling Daft Punk.",False
8,10,intense...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most facinating story.whack em all,good luck.f you hate wasp,see this",False
9,10,Serious stuff,astrologygoddess,n/a,16/08/2025,"Intensely fascinating, very well done, would love to see a follow up. Should be shown in schools. I enjoyed watching some of the world's bravest people confront such a deadly predator. Better than science fiction.",False

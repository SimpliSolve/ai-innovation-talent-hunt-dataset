1,5,Missed opportunity,jcprimeau,n/a,16/08/2025,"The subject had good potential, Lucio Dalla was a talented singer and songwriter but this effort mostly misses the mark, with some emphasis on the so-dated 1970s political environment. The choice of featured songs is rather baffling, the filmmaker seeming to focus Dalla's duds, like a bizarre (and very long) song narrating a car race. His probably greatest hit, Caruso, was totally ignored. It is also surprising that nothing was said on the aspects of his personal life that became known after his death. Overall not very interesting, unfortunately.",False

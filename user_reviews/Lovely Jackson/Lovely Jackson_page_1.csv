1,9,Simply wonderful,elleniedavila,n/a,17/08/2025,"The film had a way of bringing you in and making you feel like you were a part of it. It tugged on your heart and the way it was edited was so immersive. After finding out the actors improvised large portions, I'm even more impressed.The story of Rickey Jackson is most certainly a roller coaster of emotions. It brings such a human element to the prison system and shows you so many things you really didn't want to imagine would happen to a good person but did. He is a tough, kind person and it is shown throughout the film.Congratulations on a wonderful film to the entire crew involved. Best wishes to Mr. Jackson in all of his future endeavors.",False
2,10,Powerful & important film,ahernciara,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is a gripping story, shot and paced in a way that - even if you're familiar with the real-life events - you are on the edge of your seat the entire time. What elevates a remarkable story and filmmaking approach further: Ricky Jackson is an unequivocally amazing person. You will love him, cry for him, and want to fight for justice on his behalf.Jackson is a powerful example of what a rise-above mentality looks like, and how ""taking the higher road"" benefits not only a person wronged - but also spreads a potentially endless positive ripple effect outwards. He consistently chooses to lean into the good (compassion, empathy, kindness, forgiveness and love) over the bad (anger, resentment, revenge) - and this choice enables him to live a joyful, loving, beautiful life despite every possible obstacle. Something we can all learn from.As our very young country continues to grow and evolve, this is also a movie everyone involved in the shaping, maintaining and enforcing of our legal system should watch.",False
3,10,A Complete Original! Blown Away!,dwaldeck-23901,n/a,17/08/2025,"This completely original approach and transformation of a documentary, combined with the sheer power, emotion, and density of the story itself, combined with the incredible authenticity and open expression by the protagonist himself in his own story, will fully remove you from anything else you are thinking, doing, or worrying about for the duration of this movie... and well after! This movie will change you.",False
4,10,"Raw, Gritty and Captivating!",snelson_snelson,n/a,17/08/2025,There are very few movies that will provoke genuine emotions from beginning to end. The cinematographer angles helped to intensify some of the most important moments in the film. This docudrama is infused with intense and light hearted scenes that will have you emotionally charged.,False
5,10,This movie is a MUST WATCH!!!!!,slackerm,n/a,17/08/2025,This is a gripping and fascinating story of how Ricky Johnson was wrongfully accused and sent to prison for 39 years (the longest in American history) and never broke his spirit.,False
6,10,I admit. I cried. A lot. POWERFUL FILM!,chg-64421,n/a,17/08/2025,"What an incredible story... I have found myself thinking about this one for days after seeing it. Very intense, and even had a number of twists and turns.The production and fx really were a nice addition to the already incredible story.Cannot believe this man spent 39 YEARS in prison for a CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.",False
7,10,A Must-See Film,mireillealbilleh,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerRicky's story has changed my view of the world in numerous ways. From his long and seemingly never-ending time in prison for a crime he did not commit, to his positive attitude and outlook once he was free again. I will always think about his ability to forgive and embrace his newfound freedom by talking to people about his traumatic experience. I believe this movie perfectly portrays his story and the emotions he went through in the 39 years he spent in prison and his time on death row. As I'm writing this, I'm only 20 years old. Imagining the fact that Ricky spent twice my age in isolation is something I can't even try to imagine. For any of you reading this review who hasn't watched the movie, I highly suggest you do so immediately.",True
8,10,riveting. powerful. this movie will blow your mind!,sammcnulty-07988,n/a,17/08/2025,We sat transfixed in the dark theater on the edge of our seats the entire time.

9,10,Hits you in all the feels!,jackwaldeck,n/a,17/08/2025,"I wasn't sure what to expect when sitting down for this documentary feature film. What I for sure did not expect, however, is the emotional roller coaster that ""Lovely Jackson"" provides the audience. I can't remember the last time I cried so much!But it's not all sad: you'd think a movie about a guy wrongfully imprisoned for 39 years would be a complete ""Eeyore"" of a movie from start to finish. But it's not. I cry-cried, almost sobbing, but then there were laugh-cries too. Really hard to be the tough guy seeing this one, but thankfully the theater was dark and Mom brought tissues.The only tough guy in the room was Ricky Jackson onscreen. And rightfully so. He earned that moniker for life though I'm sorry he had to.The way his story is conveyed takes you through all of RJ's emotions, experiences and breakthroughs. There is an amazing mix of true life grit with artful presentation. The film should speak to all walks of life in so many ways.This is one of those films that will and should stick with you, constantly at the forefront of your mind. It should serve to remind you that whatever life throws at you, for however long, nothing can be as challenging as what Mr. Jackson faced. And, to see how he copes with the after affects and everyone is his life should serve as an example of how everyone the world over should behave.Cheers to Mr. Jackson, filmmaker, cast and crew for being courageous enough to show us all how to live ""happily ever after.""",False
10,10,Heart Wrenching Story Rivets You to Your Seat,jwaldeck-44756,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerFrom beginning to end this true story about remarkable Rickey Jackson never lets you go. Why? Because Rickey himself is a never ending pillar of strength who purely by chance avoids the electric chair and you are living with him every step of the way. A journey that you literally want to take with him even though it is a killer every step of the way. But when you are finished, you could not be more proud, relieved and elated.",True
11,10,Powerful and Informative,nmdwdkzj,n/a,17/08/2025,Not often do you get to see the story of an exonerated individual told in such an intimate manner. Rickey Jackson playing himself in this movie allows for the story to be genuine and for the viewer to understand obstacles he faced in prison.The raw emotion presented by Rickey in the film is something I have never really encountered in films concerning the same topic. This is an innovative form of storytelling that provides the grounds for people to engage on the topic of the wrongfully convicted.This film is informative in the sense that it touches on several issues of the American criminal justice system through the story of just one innocent man!,False
12,10,I AM NOT EASILY IMPRESSED,jaburiban,n/a,17/08/2025,"Not a sentimental or emotional person, yet I cried 3 times. The story is a 10/10, pacing a 10/10 and the visuals are so well done and real 10/10. I will go as far as to say this is my new favourite movie and will be watching this again soon. The editing was top notch and the immersion is real. A way of entertaining yourself while educating yourself. This movie is hands down the best movie of all time. I can't stress enough the after effect it left on my after watching it and the timeline follows through super well. I'm not a fan of documentaries and thought this would be one. They acted out the exact events and made it into a drama movie. The movie has its laughs too. Thank you for this movien.",False
13,10,Please watch this movie,KatieW-61,n/a,17/08/2025,"This film shows the emotional and human impact of wrongful incarceration. Rickey Jackson shares his raw and heartbreaking experience of being wrongfully accused and in prison for 39 years in an incredibly moving way. I have never seen a documentary filmed in this way. It is a unique art piece that depicts loneliness, endurance, and navigating the justice system in what can only be described as ground breaking. Somehow this film encapsulates the emotions and experience of almost four decades of wrongful incarceration in under two hours. The range of emotions you go through while learning about Rickey's experience will have a profound impact on you. Please go watch this movie on amazon prime it will change your life.",False
14,10,Wow,SiegeTO,n/a,17/08/2025,"The art that came from this pain is phenomenal, heartbreaking, inspiring, and humbling. The story is unbelievable, and the artistic portrait is outstanding. When you consider it's the director's first film, it's a masterpiece.I was lucky enough to get to see this at the Toronto black film festival and let me tell you, it was the perfect selection to start off the festival. I would definitely recommend this film for everyone to watch. Such an interesting viewpoint on systemic injustice, but also a wonderful narrative achieved in a documentary format. I can't wait to share with all of my friends.",False
15,10,"Compelling, touching and inspiring!",ginathompson-46314,n/a,17/08/2025,"I just saw this movie last night and have to say I was completely touched by it. The emotion, mental fortitude, reality and integrity that this docu-drama told through the eyes of Ricky was just incredible and so strong that it will sit with me forever.The director's use of imagery, music and story telling was on point.

17,10,Stories like this need to be told,jvasil2,n/a,17/08/2025,"This compelling docudrama tells not only the story of a man who was on death row and spent 39 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, but also the triumph of his soul by not allowing bitterness or hatred set in when it would have been easily justified.This film gives the full picture of what happens at the time of wrongful conviction, serving time as an innocent person, the parole process, the ultimate struggle to find advocates to seek true justice, the release, and trying to adjust to life after prison in a world that is much different from the last time of freedom.Anybody involved in the criminal justice system needs to see this film.",False

1,6,Drive to survive girls version,armanker,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was a fun watch mostly, you see the background stories of some girls so that you start to care about some of them. I wish actual racing got a bit more screen time. In the end they should admit the fact that girls in racing is not much different than women's basketball or football. It's great that girls do those sports but the top level is men only. I have just checked the results of Abbi and Bianca in GB3 '25 and they're not even in midfield. OK, they're rookies in GB3 but it's highly unlikely that they progress much higher in motorsports world. Again I'm a fan of Iron Dames in WEC racing. I hope the girls can make a career in motorsports but all those F1 talk is too naive to say the least.",True
2,7,Missed some key points but was an alright series,jhayley,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was entertaining enough from a film perspective. Nothing too special, but they didn't do much wrong either. Although, the hype music started to get on my nerves after a while, and I wish there was a little more actual racing.As an F1 Academy fan, I had mixed feelings about what they chose to highlight. I lost track of how many times they mentioned that Lia used to do rally. I really wish that, instead of dragging a storyline out over the whole season, they made one single episode dedicated to each story they wanted to follow. I also wish that they talked about more of the drivers, because it seemed like Bianca, Lia, and Abbi were mentioned in almost every episode while people like Nerea Marti were barely mentioned. Maybe the most important thing that they didn't mention was the controversy surrounding Doriane's performance in Jeddah. It actually seemed like they went out of their way to avoid it, which I thought was odd, especially since I was curious about Doriane's mentality after the fact.Tldr; it's a fine show that I wish was structured a little differently. Absolutely recommend it to anyone curious though, I think more people should watch Junior categories like F1 Academy and this show is a fine way to get started.",True
3,7,Good race movie documentary not a 7 part show,SOCOMBrae,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed the racing parts and getting to know the girls back stories, but there was just too much fluff. They took a two hour documentary movie and made it a 4 hours show. There was a lot of stuff you could cut out that just made it pretty boring. The racing was exciting and fun to watch the parents coaches and drivers get upset and get excited when they won. I did enjoy the show and I think it was worth watching. It was pretty obvious who the rich kid drivers with no skill were and who the best driver was. I just had to fast forward a lot. They really did need to do more editing and the show would've been a lot more enjoyable.",False
4,10,Great to see!,cjc-41796,n/a,16/08/2025,"""F1: The Academy"" delivers a compelling and much-needed spotlight on the next generation of female motorsport talent. This docuseries is a testament to the sheer dedication and raw skill of these young women who are breaking barriers in a historically male-dominated sport. The narratives woven throughout the series are incredibly engaging, allowing viewers to truly connect with the personal journeys, triumphs, and struggles of each driver. You see the grit, the determination, and the sacrifices they make, from countless hours of training to navigating the intense pressures of competition. It's inspiring to witness their unwavering commitment to their dreams, proving that talent knows no gender.Beyond the powerful storytelling, the production quality of ""F1: The Academy"" is nothing short of exceptional. From the sleek on-track footage that captures every exhilarating moment of racing, to the intimate, behind-the-scenes glimpses into their lives and team dynamics, every aspect feels meticulously crafted. The cinematography is sharp, the editing is tight, and the sound design immerses you in the roar of the engines and the tension of the paddock. It's clear that significant resources were invested to ensure this series stands shoulder-to-shoulder with other top-tier sports documentaries, providing a polished and professional viewing experience. This high level of production not only elevates the stories of these athletes but also legitimizes the F1 Academy series itself on a global stage.",False
5,10,"Phenomenal, great insight in F1",juditbartalis,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBrad Pitt is a natural!F1 is a high-octane sports drama that follows the turbulent journey of young racing prodigy Leonard ""Leo"" Faulkner, a fiercely talented but impulsive driver, as he rises through the ranks of Formula 1. The film, directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Brad Pitt and Jerry Bruckheimer, is set against the backdrop of the 2023 F1 season and blends real-world racing footage with cinematic storytelling. Pitt also stars as Sonny Hayes, a retired F1 legend lured back to the paddock to mentor Leo and revive their struggling team, APXGP, a fictional new entrant in the F1 grid.",True
6,1,Not for screen,kispe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anyone who's taken the time to watch an entire F1 race weekend - from free practice through to qualifying, the races themselves, and the post-session interviews - can clearly see the gap. These female drivers, while ambitious and clearly passionate, are light years away from the level required in Formula 1. The raw pace, race craft, wheel-to-wheel confidence, and consistency simply aren't there. And it's not just the drivers - the entire environment around them, from the teams to the engineers, seems aware of the huge difference in quality and preparation that separates them from real F1 contenders. The sad truth is that this series, rather than elevating women in motorsport, often ends up highlighting just how far they are from the top level. The intention might be good, but the execution falls short. As it stands, the F1 Academy risks discrediting itself by showcasing talent that, frankly, doesn't belong anywhere near Formula 1 - at least not yet.",False
7,9,The way all formula series should be!,me-79664,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a clear sign that the personalities and branding shows the value to engagement. Having watched F1 Academy last two seasons with intrigue finding the method and formula itself engaging (especially with the major teams and new brands). This series allowed potential favourites to be followed in more detail, without this series I was wondering who was where and why. Now we know! This kind of approach should be taken throughout academy to F4-F2! The brands and approach make it far easier to follow and instead of confusing sponsors and team brands you can see lineage. People now care more about this than they do F4-2 because they can get behind a team, see progress and understand it, rather than teams who have academies with third party teams (sometimes different brands on car for same team and even same academies). I wanna know the up comers are in a McLaren or red bull and see the change and exchange between teams , not random forever changing team names and brands , I also want to be able to engage with the back staff teams and drivers throughout the follow there story. This F1 Academy series does exactly that! Best new product out of F1 for decades! Fully invested and seeing performances this year to last can follow these drives through ....F4-2 get your branding and team alignment correct or F1 Academy will rapidly superceed!",False

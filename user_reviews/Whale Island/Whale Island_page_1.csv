1,8,I felt connection,FeiChiao,n/a,15/08/2025,"I live in inland. I've seen many BBC-made ocean documentaries . To be honest, This movie is not as good as those. There aren't many spectacles and ""once in a lifetime "" moments.But maybe because of the Chinese narration or the Chinese characters, when I finished the movie I felt the connection to the whales and the ocean.It seems their life is not far away from me.BTW
Wouldn't it be cool to have a scar hurt by a whale!",False
2,5,It's just an ordinary documentary film of 2020,marsg,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerPros:
1. The scenes are amazing, and nice to see the whales and dolphins are cruising freely in stead of seeing in aquariums.2. The movie promotions are great - well designed posters and movie score, grabbing people's attention into the movie.Cons:
1. This documentary is an overrated as the storyline isn't really about story of ocean but 3 people. Also, the stories among the three men are sluggish - very trivial stories about what projects they did or why to do etc. Unless you did some studies about these people.2. I thought the 3 men were dedicating to environmental protection works but unfortunately no, so this film is more like a portrait/autobiography film instead of ocean documentary.3. Their actions to the ocean in some extent is intruding wild sea animals' lives - whale/dolphins watching isn't a sea animal friendly activity - you may see cruisers are getting very close to the animals instead of keeping some space.",True

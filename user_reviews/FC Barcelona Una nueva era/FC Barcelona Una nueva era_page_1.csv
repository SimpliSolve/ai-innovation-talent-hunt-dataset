1,10,Visca Barca,Kritiker6969,n/a,15/08/2025,"Visca barca y visca catalunya. What a show that shows what happens in my favorite club behind the scenes. It felt amazing seeing how things are running behind what the camera shows. As we all know barcelona are facing difficult times and I think that it's perfect that they made a documentary that shows what's happening so that the fans can see the atmosphere in the club during that time plus the potential rise of the club. A new era begins in this football club and I am here to witness it, both on the field and off the field through documentaries like this one. I hope they continue making these in the future.",False

In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy.

3,5,"So, so annoying!",sanatirmizi23,n/a,15/08/2025,"The English voice overs make you want to do a poo. They are definitely not voice-over actors, someone has turned up to a 21st birthday party at 3am and recruited the biggest idiots there. It's almost as though the voice-over actors are taking the mick. The worst one was the one translating for Pedri and his family that were on the Skype call. I wish it was just subtitled instead, then it would have been a really good documentary. I still prefer the Arsenal and Tottenham series as it seemed much more intrusive and raw. I did wonder after a while, who on earth would want to be a president of a football club, it seems so stressful!",False
4,4,Ruined by the worst voiceovers ever,mdoorley,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was exited about watching this doc on the struggles of the once night Barca but the footage is utterly ruined by the voices used to narrate the action. Genuinely sounds like they ran out of money and decided to pass the mics to a few drunken blokes in a pub and said ""just do your best lads"". As a result the drama of the footage is cheapened and ruined and I ended up turning the sound off and just reading the subtitles instead. Needed a voice of authority and gravitas on there to bring it to life. Perhaps it's reflective of Barcas's financial struggles these days.It's almost comedic. Embarrassing.",False

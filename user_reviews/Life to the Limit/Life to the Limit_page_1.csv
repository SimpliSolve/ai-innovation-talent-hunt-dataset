1,10,Provides a greater understanding to Westerners of how we got to where we are,quiltysmith,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting perspective that shows how we got to the 2022 Russian full scale invasion from events in 2014.The impact of this extremely long conflict on the country of Ukraine and her people is one that the west should see in order to have a much more full understanding of the current conflict.This also lead me to watch Winter on Fire to understand the Revolution of Dignity and has helped me understand what my Ukrainian friends have explained to me over the past 2 years about their experiences from Maidan to present.The format is one that is not expected from a documentary, but works.Please watch this it is important.",False

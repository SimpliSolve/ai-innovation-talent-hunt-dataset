1,5,Hypnotic Lava Splooshing And That's It.,samxxxul,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fern Silva's first experimental feature tackles quite a few interesting and controversial topics that has Hawaii positioned between two or more extremes taking into account the history and culture. He weaves everything from cosmology to geology to ethnography and highlights the controversial establishment of a telescope on Mount Mauna Kea, one of the most sacred sites in native Hawaiian culture with opposition from the indigenous activists. I re-watched this today and still not convinced with Silva's experimental discourse on Hawaiian tradition, indigenous cosmology, the environmental concern, cosmopolitical view of the world, pop culture and the future. I know Fern Silva has put lot of research for the film, but it feels too much as it falls flat. The problem is not with the genre but with the structure, the soundtrack and is engulfed with overuse of everything. The choice of songs and music genre, indeed, that is one big problem. I was not able to finish the movie in my 2nd viewing. Better watch his short films. Tooo tired *yawn*It's 5 stars for the ethnography and for the Volcano, i'll also suggest to to take a look at a brilliant documentary by Sara Dosa titled ""Fire of Love.""P. S. I'm sure Dwayne Johnson is likely to prepare an emotional Oscar speech for his role in upcoming multiverse blockbuster King Kamehameha (pun totally not intended)",False

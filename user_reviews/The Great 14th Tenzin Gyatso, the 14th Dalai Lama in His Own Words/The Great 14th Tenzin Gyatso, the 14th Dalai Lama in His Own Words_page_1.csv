1,10,Utterly Compelling,angiemstewart,n/a,15/08/2025,Hearing the 14th Dalai Lama talk about his life is just wonderful and the old movie footage of him as a young boy and as a young man is simply amazing.,False
2,10,Beautiful and inspiring film with remarkable footage,christian_steinert,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is a very beautiful, quiet film which traces the major milestones in the life of the Dalai Lama. The words within the film are his own and told in his own voice which makes the film very endearing.The Dalai Lama's grounded and warm-hearted style and his calm determination that allowed him to deal with so many challenges throughout his life makes this very inspiring film that is definitely watching. It is an inspiring example which shows that each of us can be so much more if we try to bring out the best that we all have inside of us.There is remarkable old footage from the Dalai Lama's time in Tibet and his early time in India. A lot of it has been colorized in a remarkably good way. This footage really impressed me.",False
3,10,WHAT A REALITY REBOOT,golick-506-390819,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched this three times during free online opportunity and it was a life-changer. Each viewing revealed more undersanding. It's as if the experience was a transmission ~ a reboot in consious awareness and Soul connection. I hope many, many more people will have the opportunity and be inspired to see this docu.
and also, that it will soon be available for us to purchase in DVD format, PLEASE ðŸ’—",False
4,10,A Must See!,Emily-Kelley,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie was absolutely wonderful. It was so special hearing His Holiness speak of his life, and to see old images of him. It was put together beautifully. What a truly inspiring man. I will definitely buy it when available.",False
5,10,"Inspirational, touching, highly educative experience",catvaage,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerExtremely well filmed closeups, creating the feeling of HH the Dalai Lama being in the same room with the viewer. Kundun's words as presented here, are a wonderful integration of HH's own personal life experience, on the background of the historical events and practical situation of Tibet. There were many archive images from back in Tibet and the beginning years in India, that were new to me. Lovely to see Kundun hiking up Triund.... I saw the film three times in a span of two days and would see it again and again. I took some notes, and there were more notes I wish to take, next time I can see it. Intertwined with jokes and factual information, Kundun gives important teachings. Such as what the Avalokiteshwara statue told HH in a dream, about keeping ones courage and determination, and making a continuous effort. Or when Kundun talks about the importance of 'calling the spade a spade', HH says... something like 'things are difficult. No time to say nice things. Say things as they are'..... And there were many other such inspiring moments during the entire film. I wish for HH to have the third prophetic dream come true, so one day it could be possible for Kundun to return to Potala in this lifetime, without any danger. Gratitude to everyone involved in making this film. I hope it will reach many , and touch many. We are incredibly fortunate to be alive at the same time with such a great being.",True
6,10,Original and Real,bonniecmint,n/a,15/08/2025,"There have been quite a few filmed documentaries of the plight of Tibet and the role of the Dalai Lama. But The Great 14th is the first one I've seen that offers this history and its consequences via the voice of His Holiness. Not only is the film unique in that way, it is also beautifully done in every possible way. I did not want it to end.",False
7,10,Great experience,samd-14380,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerIt was a beautiful documentary film for all time. pleasure to get a chance to seen this kind of film. Dalai lama ji is such a inspirational personality for this time era.,True
8,10,Great documentary,livingdove-224-13175,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is great. I learned a lot about the Dalai Lama, in his own words. He is such a wonderful person. I highly recommend it.",False
9,10,Beautiful and moving,jtebmala,n/a,15/08/2025,In this beautifully crafted film the Dalai Lama talks about his life and beliefs offering us both inspiration and hope. The footage showing old Tibet is also wonderful. This film preserves an important record of a rare and precious being.,False
10,10,More than an adoration,lauridenyer,n/a,15/08/2025,"What I loved about this film, which my partner and I watched twice during the free period, was that the Dalai Lama's thoughts on so many subjects are now on record, along with the beautiful, clear way he understands and sees the world. Even if he were an ordinary person, which he clearly is not, the qualities shown here are so educational and encouraging, that that alone, not curiosity or devotion, make this film so valuable to see.",False
11,10,A very essential film for our times,alisonclarke-84101,n/a,15/08/2025,A really great documentary and a very essential film for our times.,False
12,9,A LIGHT IN EXILE,vitamanzanilla,n/a,15/08/2025,"His Holiness the Dalai Lama has been a Light in my life even before I entered into the Path of Buddhism. I went to Tibet, I prostrated in front of His empty throne, I cried bitter tears of what the Chinese have done to the country, to the people and to its temples. His life is a LIGHT in the hearts of all Tibetans everywhere, and for us who maybe were Tibetan in the previous life. I pray that He may realize his last dream of returning to prostrate in his temple in Tibet. I pray and hope...",False
13,10,Watched Twice In the Same Day. Remarkable.,cpitko,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm filled with emotion as I begin to write this review, just as I was within the first few moments of this film. I have struggled to find the ""right"" words to explain what this movie means to me.Hearing him speak of his life in this way forever changed me. There were parts that I had to stop and rewind to listen to again. The Great 14th is medicine for the soul.The history and footage of him as a child and young adult is captivating. I learned so much while also feeling motivated and hopeful. Thank you for this beautiful masterpiece.",False
14,10,Such a treasure!,lisa-24062,n/a,15/08/2025,"Kudos to this project for allowing us to see such precious historical footage of HHDL, and hear in his own words and voice what it was like! Unbelievable treasure for the ages. So many gentle words of wisdom, as if he's speaking to us personally. I've seen him speak in person multiple times, and yet this film succeeds in bringing out so much valuable material - my heart swells in gratitude.",False
15,10,A medicine the world needs now,lisa-77451,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a beautiful film! The message of His Holiness the Dalai Lama is a medicine the world so desperately needs now. The message of compassion and love so elegantly simple, yet with a profound ability to change the chaotic trajectory we are on. Can we hold his words in our hearts and remember what it truly means to be human?",False
16,10,An Oscar-Quality Film,trishthompsonasia,n/a,15/08/2025,"Beautiful and moving film of historical significance. At 85, HHDL is sharp and witty and wise. The filmmakers did their research. With the exception of a couple of shots, the footage is new to even the most avid followers of His Holiness, and includes fresh images, as well as fresh information regarding Potala Palace intrigue and the early years before being forced to escape Tibet. This is a film to watch again and again.",False
17,10,Inspiring,gonzolama,n/a,15/08/2025,Wonderful film that brought me even closer to Tibet and the Dalai Lama.,False
18,9,A fitting tribute and a real achievement,sarahdelfont,n/a,15/08/2025,"Whilst these were the words of HH the Dalai Lama, the film is a tribute to the man himself. I don't think he would see it that way! His humility, his wisdom, his humour, his compassion, his intelligence and his clarity shine through. The filming encompassed so many aspects of a life of such breadth and depth in a very short time. A true achievement. My only reason for not giving it a 10 star rating is the title itself. HH the Dalai Lama divests himself of so many trappings of the external 'greatness' of his role in this world to reveal a deeply human being, reflecting his true greatness. The title jarred for me as it somehow smacks of 'celebrity' - though I am sure it is not intended this way.",False
19,10,"A Film for the Ages, A Legacy for Every Generation",bluemoonavalon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rarely does a documentary transcend mere storytelling to become a guiding light for humanity. The Great 14th is one such masterpiece-a deeply moving, beautifully crafted tribute to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, one of the most beloved and inspiring figures of our time.This film is not just an exploration of his life; it is an invitation to witness what true compassion, resilience, and unwavering dedication to human rights look like. Through breathtaking cinematography and deeply personal reflections, The Great 14th captures the essence of a man whose very presence radiates peace. His teachings on kindness, forgiveness, and the interconnectedness of all beings have never been more relevant.For those seeking wisdom, for those yearning for hope, and for those who believe in the power of empathy to change the world-this is a film that must be seen. A testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit, The Great 14th is not just a documentary; it is a beacon for all generations.A film for the ages, for every generation.",False
20,8,A balance of head and heart,bbruneau-75274,n/a,15/08/2025,"Toward the close of this film, the Dalai Lama says he continues to practice the Two Accumulations--(i) he analyses his experience of the world, gaining insight into the way things really are, and (ii) he generates the strongest possible compassion for beings caught up in that reality. From childhood in a remote Tibetan village, to political power in a backward feudal society, to diplomatic experience with the Chinese, British, and Indian governments (and then with the whole world), to daily service for his Tibetan citizens-in-exile--all of it seen with a thoroughly Buddhist sensibility--a kind heart, and a remarkable intelligence. It matters that Tenzin Gyatso had the equivalent of a PhD in Buddhist studies in his early 20s. The Dalai Lama puts strong emphasis on the power of education to combat materialism and egoism, with many practical examples scattered though the film to make that point. The film recount the three main stages of Tenzin Gyatso's life (birth in Tibet, exile, world fame) but without losing sight of the ethical and spiritual framework that has guided him throughout. Even the segments showing his visits to China in the 1950s and the USA in the early 2000s display gentle-but-deep understanding of the historical situation, and real sympathy for everyone--even those who some might call ""enemies"" or ""the other."" The film succeeds partly because of its high production and direction values. But above all it succeeds because it is presented in the words of its subject--the Dalai Lama himself. I was moved by this film as by no other film on the Dalai Lama (and there have been many such films).",False
21,10,Incredible footage,s_mcgrane,n/a,15/08/2025,This is the best doco I've watched about HH life. Incredibly well put together. And hearing only HH's words throughout the doco is very moving. Thank you a million times over for the people who have brought this incredible doco to life.,False
22,10,Elegant film rich in History and Character,jan-19140,n/a,15/08/2025,Can't say enough good about this film. I have heard HH Dalai Lama tell his story and seen other movies about his life. This one told in his own words elegantly juxtaposes his history with film and photographs of the events. It differs from previous films by his narration from the perspective of his now 80+ years. I know of no one who has lived a life of such great honesty and integrity. The film is a true inspiration to all to live a life of compassion and wisdom.,False
23,10,Inspiring,vivduckett,n/a,15/08/2025,"Beautifully made , informative , heart-touching hit .

24,10,Watched it once then watched it again,thecoronas-84071,n/a,15/08/2025,"So well done. Some footage I've never seen, brilliantly included into the narrative. His Holiness telling his own story including some incredible dreams....one yet to come true! May it come true and may His Holiness live a very long and healthy life!!
Perhaps you could add Chinese sub titles - it could be very helpful for Chinese viewers. Many thanks for making this film.",False
25,10,"Wow, Amazingly well put together!!",ziggyheuer,n/a,15/08/2025,"Loved every moment of this documentary, What a legend!!
Probably the best movie I've ever seen that showcases His Holiness The Dalai Lama's life.",False

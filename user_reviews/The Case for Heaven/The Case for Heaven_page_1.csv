1,5,Wanted to love it,Vickiblair-46-901886,n/a,16/08/2025,It was disjointed. A few touching moments. Seemed to run in too many directions and didn't make a case at all. I wanted to see more about NDEs. But a lot of random pieces thrown in that didn't have anything to do with the topic. But the movie itself was VERY well made. Just didn't have the right ingredients. Anti-climactic.,False
2,6,Had potential,outpix,n/a,16/08/2025,The film seems to be haphazardly put together with not that much new information/thoughts on the afterlife. Having said that it's not a bad starting point for someone who is a novice to Christ. It makes some deep and profound points but they are made somewhat insignificant due to the constant and self indulgences/biography of the lead characters.,False
3,7,A movie that takes an objective look at the possibility of a Heaven,wlb,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, let me say that I am a Believer. However, I have seen a few of these movies aimed at the Christian audience that simply quote scripture to reaffirm one's belief. I saw one a few years ago of a little boy who was clinically dead describe what he saw.I don't need an affirmation, but was curious to see if the writers could effectively use an objective means outside of scripture to make the case for the existence of Heaven.Of course, nobody can scientifically prove that Heaven (or Hell) exists, but the movie did have some good moments that would make most viewers pause with thought.I will say too, that among Christians they run the spectrum of belief - outside of the essential things, of course. And some of Christians are critical and even condemn anyone straying from their own beliefs.If you think that, for example, Hell is full of fire and brimstone and tortured souls, and ready to condemn or ""correct"" anyone not holding this belief, this movie is not for you unless you at least are willing to consider another thought.The movie had its slow moments, but it had 3 highlights for me. I enjoyed the interview of a Cambridge neurologist who tells us what our neurons can tell us and what they can't, but we perceive anyway.There was an interview with a retired Christian singer, who filled stadiums, tell us how he had a crisis in faith. He describes what became his own view, using his love for his own son, how the Father loves us.Don't want to be a spoiler, but I will say that his using his own love for his son, and then saying that should he want to remain ""behind the scenes"" in his son's everyday life, is that love diminished if the son strays?"" I am not using the most accurate example in rephrasing, but will say that the man's argument gave me some pause for thought.Of course, the near death experiences were interesting and compelling, and some of the interviewees weren't Christian.In summary, the movie isn't ground breaking, nor could it be. But there is enough it it to make both believers and non-believers cause to reflect.",False
4,6,"Good film, but doesn't stay on track with theme",donllance,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've read the wonderful book by Lee Strobel, and found it provided answers to the many questions that people have about what happens after a person dies, and what heaven is like if it's real. I was excited to hear about a movie based on the book and did not want to miss it.I found the movie very good and would recommend it to anyone. A concern is that the movie did not seem to be on-track with the ""case for heaven"" as the book, and at times it deviated into areas that were not in the book. Occasionally I found myself asking, ""How does this support the case for heaven?"" The answer was not clear to me. Also I noticed that several topics in the book (such as whether there is evidence for reincarnation instead of heaven) was not mentioned at all.Is it a good movie you should see? Yes. Does it represent the material in the book well? Only partially. So even if you see the movie, be sure to read the book as it contains so much more I wish had been included.",False
5,10,Mind blowing and Moving.,mbeckhart,n/a,16/08/2025,Such a great film for those who are seeking answers and had some misconceptions growing up in the church. Even those who did not grow up in the church this is a great investigation into what happens to us after we die. Never stop seeking. I was so fortunate to be able to see this film during the three days it was out in theaters. Looking forward to it streaming. Would love to be able to see the extra's.,False
6,1,No evidence and contrary to Scripture,mmarks72719,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a mess of a ""documentary."" Some segments seem entirely random and disconnected from any apologetic aim to the point of a ""Case for Heaven.""
Lee desperately needs to get back into Scripture and away from this X-Files ""the truth is out there"" babble. A line he claims in this program would be the one thing he'd tell his younger self if he could...The true evidence for Heaven is not based on pseudoscience NDE stories and stats - how about the fact Jesus spoke of both Heaven and Hell, and the credibility of the realities of both places is grounded in His authority as the Son of God? And that authority is substantiated by many means Lee's written of years ago.The vignettes are haphazard and frankly confusing. An apostate songwriter who walked away from Christ is given free and UNCHALLENGED time to express breathtaking ignorance of Scripture and of a true relationship with Jesus - for what purpose?!I have studied and taught apologetics for over 30 years and this was the most shallow, destructive representation of a case for any aspect of Christianity I can recall by someone of such former stature in the faith. Truly disappointing on so many levels.",False
7,10,thoughtful,Penguins273,n/a,16/08/2025,"I appreciated the well rounded POVs the film provided, so that believers and non believers alike could relate to it with giving an opportunity for those who don't believe to consider asking certain questions. The fact that believers are the most critical means they think this film was meant for them alone. But just like the church is meant to be for the sinners.... So this film was meant for hearts to be opened and I appreciated that so much. I love that the book and film go in different directions, allowing the viewer to not feel like they've wasted their time rewatching what they just read. Strobel mentioned that in several interviews leading up to me watching it- that it would offer more and differing things than just what his book discussed. Honestly, I left the theater wanting to see more of each interview and would pay for any of the extended interviews. I can't explain too much here without giving too many spoilers, but I cried and related to many of the different stories. I love the artistic point of views of different walks of life and how faith impacts generations, so ONE person's near death experience and their coming to Christ would affect so many generations to follow. It's beautifully done, and the music made you want to feel like you could hear John Burke talk about heaven all day.... And eager to be there with Christ asap.Anyways. Loved it. When can we see more?",False
8,1,Skip it,33muir,n/a,16/08/2025,"I study near death experiences. I read everything I can about them. This was rubbish. There was only two near death experiences in this, the rest was a load of drivel from the two men who thought their views on things were so important and interesting, and I couldn't even get through it. It had to keep speeding through, hoping for more actual near death experiences, but there was none. There are much better shows than this, like- I survived beyond and back - Familythat has actual near death experiences it's not biased towards Christianity. I believe in god and an afterlife but there are so many ndes that have different religions in them, I feel if you're going to make a documentary about near death experiences you should cover all of the different kinds, different religions, good and bad ones, hell, people who experience the void etc. They all lead to the same place which is love/heaven, but this focus solely on Christianity, which I think would put a lot of people off.",False
9,10,Fantastic documentary,jqwppfhmg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Recently I had the opportunity to watch this film. Let me start by saying, the cinematography is beautiful, the music , beautiful. The movie based on Lee Strobels book The Case For Heaven . Lee's research and investigation of Heaven . The movie does not condemn or put others down . Rather offers hope to maybe there is a better place when we pass . Science, psychology and faith, all of these were used to illustrate a bigger picture. I'm short it's a beautiful documentary.",False
10,3,Do Yourself a Favor and Just Read the Book.,alex_woodruff,n/a,16/08/2025,"This had so much uncapped potential. The framework was laid out, but they never dove into the details written in the book. I was left scratching my head during so many moments of this movie. They utilized unorganized cinematography to try and create an ascetic that was never needed in the first place.The only part that I enjoyed was when they interviewed John Burke, who wrote ""Imagine Heaven"" based on his research of Near-Death experiences.As a believer, I was very disappointed.And if I were an unbeliever, I would have not been spiritually challenged.Do yourself a favor, and just read the book.",False
11,10,Excellent!,kevingn,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a wonderful, thought-provoking movie. Since it was only in theatres for a 3-day release, I felt fortunate to have seen it on the big screen. The cinematography is fantastic. If you watch this movie with an open mind, you will truly enjoy it.",False
12,3,Do you believe in Heaven?,colonialquills,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would very much like to be able to recommend this, especially for non-believers. There are some really moving pieces, especially about near-death experiences of both heaven and hell. Lee's story and the Christian message are absolutely excellent, but this movie itself we found to be long, drawn out and somewhat disjointed. We were quite disappointed in the way that it was made, but the message is spot on. If you have the time and can wade through it, the teaching points are well worth it.Thanks to Pure Flix for providing a sample of the product for this review. Opinions are 100% my own.#CaseForHeavenMIN #MomentumInfluencerNetwork #BooksYouCanFeelGoodAbout #ChristianMovie.",False
13,10,Powerful Movie!,bethanylord,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWow. I had chills throughout the whole movie. I even found myself in tears at the end. The way they broke down the film into sections allowed viewers to really track with the information being presented. They also did a fantastic job of blending personal stories with larger anecdotal evidence and scientific evidence.So thankful this movie has been done. So many people are afraid of death and truly believe there is nothing after death. This is a must see, especially if you're a doubter or truly don't know where you're going after you die.",True
14,n/a,Full of wonder,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,The wonder and beauty and glory of Life Himself is beyond comparison. I got a little teary when I watched this movie. What a sweet reminder of the gift we have in Jesus! The soundtrack by Eric Owyoung (Future of Forestry) is stunning. And Mani Sandoval is the real deal. It's a beautiful film!,False
15,4,"Wanted to love it, but definitely didn't.",rlleigh,n/a,16/08/2025,"Full disclosure, I am a fan of Strobel's ""Case for Christ"" and a true Christian who has been saved by the Lord of Lords, Jesus Christ, so my expectations for this move were high. But this movie was a miss, not a hit.While there are Believers who have interesting comments in the film, I wasn't expecting to listen to 'fair and balanced' personal viewpoints made by people who are not Christians. This movie was made from a vantage point that is ecumenical, and at times, secular.A singer who was a ""Believer"" was featured; he abandoned his faith because, he admitted in a round about way he never truly was born again, and in his way of thinking, ""His God"" wouldn't send to people to Hell. Nothing original about that, straight from the Rob Bell School of Bad Theology. Why he was given a platform in this movie is bewildering. I guess to present another point of view?! Interesting, we get the alternative view, day in and day out by the vast majority of people who don't believe in God, Jesus, Sin, Heaven, or Hell. That viewpoint is everywhere, it is the norm in today's society, and it's clearly the broad path to destruction.There is a focus on Strobel's marriage and family, which didn't fit well into the storyline nor made the case for Heaven.Overall, the quality of the film was not good; the plot line was disjointed, and at times it seguayed toward the irrelevant. The movie wasn't well edited and clearly had a low budget. No, it didn't need to be a big production, but the sound track didn't even match the mouths of the speakers...pretty annoying.I went to this movie with friends from my church; we were looking forward to seeing it together. If I hadn't been there with them I would have walked out at the halfway point because, lamentably, it lurched along from the dull to inane.Sure, I'd still recommend this over a Marvel franchise movie, or any of the rubbish being produced by Hollywood today. But on it's merit alone, I can't recommend this movie. It's highly unlikely it will compel anyone to come to Christ or to look forward to the glorious eternity God has planned for those He loves and who believe in His Son.",False
16,10,Thought Provoking,celiasommer,n/a,16/08/2025,"A series of diverse heartfelt interviews bring to light some thoughts and emotions about our existence after death, offering a variety of perspectives on Christianity, Jesus, Heaven, and the existence of Hell. The film intertwines near death experiences, personal revelations, scientific research, and Lee Strobel's own compelling transformation from Atheism to Christianity in a creative intertwined thought provoking exploration.Raw human emotion on matters of the soul and eternity are captured with beautiful cinematography, bringing to life humble thoughts about the existence of Heaven.As a neurobiologist and someone who has had a near death experience, I was curious. This is a must-see movie if you want to provoke some thoughtful contemplation about life after death.",False
17,1,Terrible,ggray2003,n/a,16/08/2025,"I came away from this documentary thinking ""if god were merciful"" he would have made this movie 10 min long. There we're so many irrelevant scenes. Odd special effects. This could have been so good if they had actors ""act out"" six short stories about near death or out of body experiences that related to God.",False
18,10,Great Presentation of the Evidence that there is more to life than just our experiences on Earth.,ckeener-79344,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Case for Heaven is a great presentation of the evidence the there is a life after death. Lee Strobel brings the evidence together in a very logical way that I think helps to point out some of the road blocks that people may have that cause them struggle with overcoming the idea of Heaven or Hell.Those making negative comments regarding the interview with the former Hawk Nelson band member must have missed the proceeding scene where Lee Strobel addresses the issues he brought up. He explains how God is not unjust and unloving who sends his children to hell, rather it is our choice, he is offering us the gift of Heaven with him but we have to accept that gift, otherwise we choose the alternative. Scripture makes this very clear, and I think the film also makes this argument very well. I think it was good to have the Hawk Nelson band member featured because many who watch the film may struggle in the same way he is, and will get to hear Lee Strobel address those very issues.Overall I really enjoyed this film and hearing all of the testimonies and the near death experiences first hand by those interviewed in the film. I loved hearing each persons unique insight and responses to Mani's questions and I think Mani did a great job guiding the conversations throughout the film.",False
19,1,Disappointing,nkrfnfdf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Case for Christ is a Christian classic. Unfortunately, this film was nothing like I expected from Strobel. It was a poor quality, disjointed production that was confusing to me even as a believer. It had some interesting moments,but other parts left me shaking my head. Such as, a Christian musician who decided he wasn't a believer after all and got much understanding,love and support on social media for his stance. Strobel includes his wonderful testimony of salvation ,but the way it was included didn't mesh well with the "" case for heaven "" . .I I have enormous respect for Lee Strobel and often recommend his books and works. This is not one of them.",False
20,10,"A beautiful, emotional film with an encouraging message",benbeckhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a beautiful, emotional film that shared powerful testimonies from many different people. The testimonies are moving, relatable and all very unique, as they grapple with deep and important issues of faith. The scenery and the cinematography in this film is absolutely incredible. Overall it was encouraging and moving, and I'd highly recommend it.",False
21,1,Was hoping for a new story line,brianbaucum,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unfortunately this is going to cover a great deal of information that you probably already know. I'm not sure who the audience is for this documentary, but if you don't already know the information given in this film you haven't dug very deep. I have nothing against Christian beliefs, the Bible, Jesus or any other religions that help you live a healthier happier more productive life. But this has nothing to do with whether there is proof of heaven or not. This film consistently spouts out scripture and Christian beliefs that have been peddled for centuries. Again, it has nothing to do with proving whether there is heaven or not.",False
22,10,It Was A Blessing To Watch,AudioFileZ,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been a Christian throughout my life. I have felt struggles with desires not congruent with being a Christian. I have let guilt enter. Through it all I believed. Believed, not meaning I had no questions, but choosing Faith over letting those questions tear at the core of believing Jesus Christ is my personal, as well as the world's, Savior. So many worldly and personal imperfections sometimes arise to tear at this core Christian belief. I understand much is due to having original sin in a world that also is shaped by this. It makes me need my Savior more. To get encouragement is always a blessing when it comes to Faith. I find this excellent documentary centering around journalist Lee Stroubel very much a blessing of encouragement. The way the filmmaker, Sandoval, goes about telling his story is moving. The side stories are eternal life affirming. The whole is a blessing to watch even coming in as a Believer. It is with great hope that others, including those who are absent of Faith, to find that Blessing too. I am truly moved.",False
23,2,"I Though it was something real and scientist. But no, only catholic trash",urkus,n/a,16/08/2025,"All Catholic trash. I am an atheist and and Don't believe in any religion. If what we have when we die is heaven and hell and christ, what happens with other religions?? Other cultural diversities??? What happens if you are a buddist?? You see Christ?? Come on...It is treated from a point of view of catholic church. I was finding somethin real for everyone. I Don't believe in any cultural Different religion. How could it be that your atheist friend was death and he was with god? I can't belive it.I was hopping somethin scientific, but everything was North American Catholics trash. This documentary doesn't tell you the truth. The truth is different for everyone. I think we will develop energy, cause thats what we are and I will not be in heaven or in hell. They told you they will talk you about scientific things, but it transforms in something that is a lie. Didn't like it. Catholic church lies in every minute. Very bad done. I stopped watching it because it was horrible.2 stars out of 10.",False
24,8,Not the movie I was expecting - thought provoking and beautiful,mamamoore,n/a,16/08/2025,"The question ""what happens after we die?"" is what begins the journey down the rabbit hole. After looking at why people are afraid to die, the movie looks at what we do to ""live forever"" or leave a legacy, and how we know there is something after this life. From interviews that feel like two friends having a conversation to recounting stories of near-death experiences, witnesses offer testimony to support the case for heaven.I already had my answer to the Case for Heaven, but that doesn't mean the movie was boring in an ""I already know the ending"" kind of way. The use of such a variety of witnesses makes this quite a thought provoking movie. Each person has their own testimony - and they aren't all saying the same thing.The movie is made even more enjoyable to watch because of how beautiful it is. It is very well done, the various locations, the buildings (gorgeous churches, cemeteries), the music, etc. Come together to create a movie that is a delight for the senses.",False
25,10,Impactful,elizabethtorres-25977,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved that it wasn't the usual storytelling - or what I expected to see in a movie regarding Heaven , but rather people from various walls of life sharing their story and really making you see this topic from so many angles. . Very thought provoking and really resonated with me .",False

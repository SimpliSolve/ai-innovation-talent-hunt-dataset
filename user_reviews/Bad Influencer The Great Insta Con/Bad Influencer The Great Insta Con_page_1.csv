1,3,Just watch her 60 minutes interview...,christophschilling,n/a,16/08/2025,"Honestly, this was stretched out like many Netflix ""documentaries"" these days. The story itself is interesting but why do we have to hear about menial details and opinions of people who were barely involved? Is Netflix so determined to waste our time? Many of the shots are recycled a few times during the episodes and in general it feels like very little content to fill 2x90 minutes.I started skipping towards the end of the first episode and stopped in the second. I decided to watch her famous 60 minutes interview because there you see much more of her delusion and the skilled journalist who confronted her about her lies. There is not much background told in the 60 minute interview, but to be honest, what they have in the documentary is not that interesting.",False
2,8,Left me wanting more,Wistfull,n/a,16/08/2025,"A compact, surprisingly broad documentary about the fraudulent wellness influencer Belle Gibson. It felt like this could have been twice the length, as many things only got a superficial look-in. An even broader and much deeper analysis on the entire topic of wellness would have contextualised this individual story better.Still, worth a watch!",False

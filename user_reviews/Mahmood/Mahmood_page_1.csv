1,4,Meaningless and distant.,Waedliman,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I make a documentary about a person, I have to have something to tell, an intention, a plan, what I ultimately want to communicate to the viewer. I don't blame Mahmood for saying little about himself and trying to express this through his songs, which, if you don't speak Italian, seem to have confused lyrics that don't necessarily make sense. Even after the documentary ended, I didn't get any closer to Mahmood as a person, as if the director was deliberately keeping him at a distance. So I can say for myself that the whole project has unfortunately failed. But I don't begrudge Mahmood his success and would have liked him to win the song contest.",False

1,8,Smart and Concise,toonf8,n/a,15/08/2025,"As usual, Tubi originals Evil Among Us: Ted. Bundy is well done. Informative and entertaining it presents the information in a way that is easy to follow, with interviews and historic film clips it captures the mood of the country while Bundy terrorized the west toward his explosion of violence in Florida that ended his blood soaked career. I remember when the press covered every part of his reign of terror, but as slick and greasy as Bundy comes across sadly some of the Florida law officials don't come across much better. From Ken Katsaris, who's petty vindictive behavior destroyed any chance for the state to maintain the high ground, he proceeded to attempt to use the atrocities committed in his part of the state as a springboard for his personal career. I always find it creepy AF when law enforcement calls a criminal evil. Always says more about the police who do it than it does the criminals they use it to describe. Everyone knows what Bundy was, but Ken got down in the mud with him and came away dirty. Even in this documentary you can hear his self congratulatory attitude as he promotes him self. Pathetic at this point. The usual experts provide commentary throughout and as usual, the charming Tristen Engels is captivating. Her insights are brilliant and spot on. She is always a high point in the Evil Among Us series. I hope to see her in any future ideation of the TV show. She is truly outstanding.",False
2,3,Evil Among Us,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter more than a decade of court cases, Ted Bundy confessed to 30 murders committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978 but may have murdered even more. He used charm to win over women, often meeting them in public and asking for help before beating them and taking them elsewhere to be killed.Written by Adam Meyer, this Tubi original breaks down his murders, how he was caught, how he escaped and how he was caught again and tried.If you watch true crime, you know that he would go back to the dead bodies and keep making love to them, as well as keeping their heads as trophies. He was so horrific that even a member of his last defense, Polly Nelson, said, ""Ted was the very definition of heartless evil.""I still can't believe how many times he escaped the police. He jumped out of a window at the Pitkin County Courthouse law library and no one caught him for some time, leading him to Florida and even more murders.He also turned his trials into entertainment, even using one to marry Carole Ann Boone. He also offered his services to those seeking other serial killers as he kept putting off the death penalty until 1989, an event that was celebrated by some like a public holiday.If you already know all that, you may not need to watch this. If you don't, this is a good beginning for a horrible person.",True

1,10,Must watch for every youth,ksr-91822,n/a,16/08/2025,What a motivational heart filling documentary. What todays youth needs is this kind of training and discipline which will shape up their lives. Ladakh scouts - salute to you. The instructors - double salute to you. God bless ! I hope HRD dept recognise their services and design similar courses and must be made compulsory for all the youth. I am so glad that I watched this great documentary.,False

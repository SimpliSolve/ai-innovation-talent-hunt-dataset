1,9,One of THE BEST true crime drama series to come along...,carnagecarney,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watch all the true crime I can get my hands on. ""Crime Beat"" is one of the best true crime series I have ever seen come out of North America. Period.Very fast paced, re-enactments move the plot forward, every scene has a purpose, great narration and true commentary by real life detectives add that layer of authenticity without falling into ""the boredom trap"" of many other similar shows.Every episode is gripping, suspenseful, terrifying...this series brings it all, in spades.Highly (highly) recommend - cannot wait for season 2 (looks like it was just released!!!)",False
2,8,The Brentwood Five Massacre,firballblaze-69689,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf those buttholes murdered my son or daughter and they let them walk free, I would say ok go ahead and set them free. Then I would hunt them down and put a bullet in their forehead, plead insanity,and obviously I would walk free because I'm insane right? As long as I take meds I'll be good right? :) That's the message they're sending!!!",True
3,8,Excellent Series-Poor Presenters & Music,jayydee3,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed watching this series as it is about crime in Canada.What I didn't like is the horrible music that starts the program. Some of the presenters on different episodes are very bad and have terrible speaking voices. If these two dislikes were eliminated I woud give it 9 out of 10. It seems that the series is done on a low budget and thus the terrible music and poor presenters. Good that they have a show focusing on Canadian Crimes for a change without all the ""drama"" on the usual on all of the standard American TV crime shows. Anyways it is certainly worth watching and I do hope they will continue the show .",False
4,10,Straight forward Crime reporting ...,mingo59-241-858761,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a somewhat continuation of the PodCast by Nancy Hixt. It is a reporters view of some of Canada's most heinous crimes. Each reporter re-investigates their own crime. There is no sugar coating of this topic, and can be quite emotional. A+",False
5,10,Best true crime show,laurali-20838,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm quite fascinated by what people are capable by killing other people. It is so very hard to fathom. I watch alot of real crime shows.Crime Beat has to be the best crime show I've ever seen. And I've seen tons. It is done very well. Very educational in telling the story. It is done so much so much better than the USA crime shows.Great detective interviews and interviews with family members. I have been sick in bed and have watched 3 days straight of this show.Fascinating stories of crime victims and the hunt to find the killers. I think the most fascinating stories in Canada. Look forward to more seasons of this show.,False
6,9,One of the Best True Crime Series,portal1790,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is nothing like ""Snapped"" or ""See no Evil"" but the formula is the same. The difference is that all episodes are about powerful true crime events and not so repetitive format as so many true Crime shows.",False
7,10,Crime Beat is great in podcast and on TV,kelaj-70057,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI came here actually to place a comment on a particular episode but for some reason the content isn't up to date on imdb.I like that the stories are Canadian and produced well but at the same time it reminds me of how poorly run our justice system is. After the police find these people they are often released or have very light sentences.The episode I am currently watching is ""Against All Odds"" where a German family is mistakenly targeted in a drive by shooting. I truly fell for this family and was struck by the fact that they said the doctors in German couldn't have helped their father as much because they just don't have experience with these injuries involving bullets. Let that sink in.Then the person responsible is a teen and we can't release his name because poor 16 year old ""Billy"" is still developing and we don't want to hurt his future. Seriously? If you're old enough to do meth and fire a gun into a passing car, you're old enough to have your name our there and suffer the consequences. We aren't talking about sealing a chocolate bar from the 7-11 we are talking about murdering a person with a modified shot gun!",True
8,4,OH CANADA.......,jreeders518,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show is very repetitious, could have been presented in a half an hour. Violent criminal's in Canada have a lot going for them. Mass killer gets a full release. Guy cuts off another guy's head and then eats him in front of people, is free. The families of these victims are in disbelief. Who can blame them. These rules are incredible. I saw on Family Guy them making funof it all of the time.",False
9,4,Pick up the pace Canada,gypsy-87293,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe narrator is extremely slow. The episodes have at least 20 minutes that are totally unnecessary. This series, though, has exposed the Canadian judicial system is actually worse than America's. America, overwhelmingly, puts minorities and poor people in jail. Many punishments are unfair, far too long, or outright false. But in Canada it appears you're innocent even if proven guilty. The episode about the guy allowed out on bond AFTER being found guilty because he intended to appeal is tots insanity. Does not make any sense.",True
10,1,Too slow moving and not genuine.,bevinkates,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't get into Caryn Lieberman's episodes, it's clear she doesn't really care and is doing a poor job of acting as though she does. I just can't watch when she's hosting so I don't.",False
11,1,Global Keeps renewing this is a crime,cdeanroane,n/a,16/08/2025,"3 season in still one of the dullest true crime shows there is. If the pod case is as dull and lack luster as the TV version, it would put the listeners to sleep or worse yet into a coma! Antony Robart robotic delivery is just bad. This is a show only that could get air time in Canada as it is that dull!",False
12,1,"A dull bland true crime show, Seems to a be a filler because of CoVid virus!",cdeanroane,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you have watched a fair number of true crime shows you will fine this show somewhat tedious and dull. The reporters at time seem to want to make their coverage of a crime more important then the work of the police working the crime, This show has gotten a season season with both first and second happening in 2020. This show is based off a pod cast which I have not listen to, and this show gave me to reason to want to listen to the pod cast. I feel this is show that was quickly put together as filler for shows being shut down due to CoVid 19 virus.",True

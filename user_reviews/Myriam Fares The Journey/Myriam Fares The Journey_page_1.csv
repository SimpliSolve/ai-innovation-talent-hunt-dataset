1,1,So shallow and irritating,isamnasr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Couldn't finish as I can't Stand fake people
Sad how she collected all her social media videos and decided to make a pointless movie. Or documentary about nothing really.",False
2,1,A wish,zaidmahmood-45451,n/a,16/08/2025,"I rlllly wish if I could give lower than one
That would be great
Its not a documentary most of it are staged and acted obviously.",False
3,1,Cheap acting,abnamisraa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I could not finish .Cheap acting , everything was fake.",False
4,1,This is horrifically bad film,amirasalameh,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the worst things you could watch on Netflix or TV in general. Honestly, it's not easy to create such a horrifically bad production, from the storyline, depth of conversations to acting. Something Tommy Wiseau would be proud of.",False
5,1,A Learning Experience!,workoutsmurf,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want a crash course on what complete narcissism and idiocy looks like, this ""movie"" is for you! One woman manages to make a 71minute Instagram or TikTok post and call it film. I have never seen a more self-obsessed and vapid person praise herself and her ""achievements"" more than Myriam. Congratulations you had a baby, yeah, so have billions of other women, and even for hundreds of thousands of years before you! This ""film"" is what happens when a narcissist has too much free time on her hands, and needs to boost her ego. The videography was jumbled, there was basically zero storyline, NOTHING to connect the viewer on ANY level, unless you are also narcissistic. Save yourself this ""journey"" and watch something else far more educational and entertaining. This is an exercise in nothing more than self-absorbency.",False
6,1,Silly and fake,ammarb-16423,n/a,16/08/2025,Netflix must delete this fake and silly thing as soon as possible. This is the worst documentary on earth.There are hundreds of celebrities to make a documentary about. How did they choose this one?,False
7,1,Just a pretty face.,sheslider,n/a,16/08/2025,"She's sensitive in a way that it's all about her. She spent 1/10 of the film sewing a garbage bag. Posing by the pool , posing during her kids 6th bday party. Jayden sings and then she forced a hug. She's this doting mother that emphasizes how important her kid is to her while we really didn't see anything of the kid's personality.. The son and father's face are never seen in the documentary to protect their privacy while they video the poor little newborn upclose and personal the moment it drops outa mom. She's a beautiful face and like 80% of the Lebanese nation has great sense of style and knows how to bewitch the camera .",False
8,1,I mean it's really bad,bellatrixn,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI didn't see anything that life shattering to make a documentary about it. She is a narcissist who has an abundance of money, a mansion on the water, partnership, a beautiful child, a thriving career, and now a Netflix documentary while people literally don't even think of having a partner, child, or hobbies because they were literally dying during COVID. We were burying our parents in giant freezer bags in a truck, and her big tragedy of her son not having a big holiday party with family or having to homeschool the child she actually raises is insufferable.Narcs don't need a special documentary. They're starring in their own show 100% of life.The nerve of giving her a documentary when the city itself exploded but ""well thank god that's not our house."" Pretending to cry in one shot then practicing yoga and swimming with her kid in the next scene while the city around her was in strife. It's just disgusting.",True
9,10,Good job Myriam!,karimtarekyoussef,n/a,16/08/2025,This is the first documentary to be based on Arab singer. I'd generally describe it as light and cute. Myriam filmed and produced the whole thing herself.,False
10,10,Emotional and full of stories.,AdamMohammed41,n/a,16/08/2025,"Myriam had presented a huge surprise for her fans... This documentary revealed many secrets and parts of her life that she didn't tell about before, also, It is in the way of reality shows.Main focus was her family and the time during Covid-19 Lockdown period. She was super natural and like what we used to see her.",False
11,10,Bravo Myriam Fares,zezoabd-71752,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love the documentary very, very realistic and natural and has a very beautiful family. I wish her well and wait for songs from her new albums, and I want to add something that she deserves to reach the world and proved it in many of her artwork, whether singing, acting or professional dancing, remembers that she's one of her most important singing work, Ana wel shoq , 2003, Nadini, 2005, and Enta btoul Eih 2008 , Albums, 2011, Min Oyouni , and Aman, 2015, and acting Selena and an accusation, and her global collaborations with the stars of Florida, Maloma and star Nicki minaj . Xoxoxoxoxxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxox.",False
12,10,Very personal,projectvcairo,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is shot on the way of reality TV. It's very personal and showing another side of Myriam. It's nice to finally see and Arab singer on Netflix and Myriam was definitely the right choice. Myriam is considered one of the most influential female singers in the MENA region and this was well deserved.Myriam's undeniably successful career in the music industry has been the talk of the Arab world for years, with her songs like ""Ghmorni"" becoming huge hits; in 2014, she also made her acting debut in the television series Itiham. To add to the list, she is now the first Arab artist to star in a Netflix documentary.",False

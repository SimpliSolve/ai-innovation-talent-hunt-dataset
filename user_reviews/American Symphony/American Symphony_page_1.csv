1,8,A Beautifully Touching Film,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Creating a great work of art is very much like creating a heartfelt, loving relationship. Both take work and commitment, both in good times and bad. The challenges can be difficult, but the rewards can be incalculable. Learning how to successfully maneuver through them, as well as how to strike a harmonious balance that keeps both ventures moving forward, is a skill that takes an array of abilities and aptitudes s to master, but, as documentary filmmaker Matthew Heinenman's latest so deftly illustrates, it's an attainable goal, the prevailing highs and lows notwithstanding. The film follows the extraordinary year experienced by musician/composer Jon Batiste and his wife, best-selling author Suleika Jaouad. In 2022, they came face to face with both ends of the spectrum of life. Batiste, an artist with an impressive musical range and repertoire, was reaching new heights in his career, winning five Grammy Awards while serving as band leader on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and seeking to complete work on an ambitious composition aimed at reflecting the breadth of our national music, diversity and culture, American Symphony. At the same time, though, Jaouad suffered a recurrence of the cancer she battled a decade earlier, an illness she chronicled in writings that would come to launch a career; now, after a 10-year remission, she was facing a second, potentially risky bone marrow transplant to treat her condition, not to mention an uncertain future. With such seemingly polar opposite fates befalling them, Batiste and Jaouad struggled to get through their respective challenges while keeping their love and art alive, putting their successes into perspective in light of what they were up against otherwise. This intimate, heartstring-tugging documentary gives viewers a candid, up-close look at what a truly loving couple can experience under such diverse, trying and bittersweet circumstances, but without becoming manipulative or melodramatic. This beautifully photographed story provides an unfiltered depiction of the range of emotions that each partner goes through, particularly when it comes to its depictions of the philosophical insights observed by each of the spouses. It also showcases Batiste's wide-ranging musical styles, both in his performances and in his composition process. Admittedly, a few of this offering's sequences meander a bit, but the overall production is skillfully edited and sensitively portrayed. ""American Symphony"" is a beautifully moving film, one that reinforces what matters most in life and what makes it worth living, during both good times and bad, as long as we have each other to make our way through it, bringing new meaning to what our marriage vows are ultimately all about.",False
2,8,Wondrous journey into two souls,rickchatenever,n/a,16/08/2025,"2022 was the best of times, the worst of times for Jon Batiste and Suleika Janouad.Both. Everywhere. All at once. In every moment.It was the year the couple married. It was the year Jon left his high-profile gig leading the band on The Late Show with Steven Colbert. He would go on to win five Grammys, including the coveted Album of the Year, which hadn't been won by a Black artist in more than a decade.Although Suleika's bestselling ""Between Two Kingdoms: A Memoir of a Life Interrupted"" would be acclaimed as one of the best books of the 2022, she would spend most of the year in hospital beds, receiving chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant and other treatments for the recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia, a rare condition that had first stricken her a decade earlier.On September 22 of that year, Jon Batiste premiered his ""American Symphony"" in Carnegie Hall. His wife was in the audience.These events provide the framework for Matthew Heineman's powerfully affecting documentary that shares the title of Batiste's musical creation. Its Higher Ground production company was created by Michelle Obama and her husband in 2018 with the goal of lifting diverse voices in the entertainment industry. It's playing on Netflix.It feels meant to be, writing about ""American Symphony"" after recent blogs reviewing ""Maestro"" and ""American Fiction."" They have a lot in common. Like ""Maestro,"" it presents a loving marriage of creative giants, the husband fulfilling his artistic genius, the wife beset by setbacks and pain beyond belief.Like ""American Fiction,"" it focuses on a brilliant Black artist staking his creative claim in a society built on a foundation of the enslavement of his race. (The similarity of the films' titles is unfortunate, confusing and diluting each's powerful impact during this awards season.)
Except, unlike the other two films, ""American Symphony"" doesn't have actors. It has the actual people. They're not acting, they're living their lives.Filmmaker Heineman is the third member of their marriage, capturing an intimacy that rarely makes its way to the screen. He's there with them in their bedroom or her hospital bed, as they grapple with everything coming their way. In one light-hearted interlude, Suleika takes Jon to the snow. He has never sledded before. We ride down the hill with them, lost for a moment in giddy, silly escape.But not for long.Pain, isolation and discomfort are givens in Suleika's illness. What's not expected is the resilience, philosophical strength and occasional bursts of humor she finds to face them. In her bed she starts painting giraffes. They quite good, actually.By her side supporting her, Jon is also up against a different set of challenges. Scion of a New Orleans musical dynasty, his gifts transported him to Juilliard en route to a rarified place in the musical hierarchy where fame itself may become his greatest danger.Heineman - and his three co-cinematographers - transport us into his brain, recording telephone sessions with Jon's therapist flowing into voice-over commentary that unflinchingly probes his artistic process, and the insecurities besetting artists no matter how much acclaim they achieve.The documentary was filmed in the time of Covid, but finds endless expressiveness in its characters' eyes. When they remove their masks, their faces are visually striking element in the film's grand design. Jon's smile is sunshine; his dance moves are joy itself.The creation of Batiste's symphony provides a plot of sorts, as he mines deep ore in all the cultures that have produced ""America,"" beginning with the Indigenous people who were here when the Whites arrived, bringing the Blacks in chains a short time later. He melds their sounds into a musical masterwork that defies labels - classical, jazz, roots, blues, bebop, hip-hop and a hundred others - because it's them all.But the film's real symphony isn't just the music. It's the two people/ at the center of the story, bravely leading us on this wondrous journey into their souls.",False
3,8,So moving,masonsaul,n/a,16/08/2025,"American Symphony is an incredibly personal documentary that strikes a very strong balance between its portrayal of the artistic process and a beautiful relationship. It may be conventional but when it's so well crafted and its story is so emotionally resonant it's near impossible not to be moved or affected by any of this.Jon Batiste is very open here, showing so much in what feels like a very real look at his life and struggles. A magnetic presence when on the stage yet so humbling and relatable in everyday life. It's so interesting to watch his ideas forming in real time whilst his relationship with Suleika Jaouad gives the film its strongest moments.Matthew Heineman's direction manages to be very cinematic in its construction whilst still being able to maintain a consistent sense of intimacy. The structure of the film is really good too, building to the titular symphony in classic biopic fashion which gives it so much weight. Batiste's music and closing song really compliments everything and further foregrounds his undeniable talent.",False
4,7,peek inside the curtains,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Musician Jon Batiste is composing a symphony while his wife/writer Suleika Jaouad undergoes cancer treatment. This is a documentary. I know Jon Batiste only through ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"". My surface take on him is radical positivity. It's more than being Ed McMahon. He seems like a guy who reacts with a smile no matter what the situation. This movie lets the audience a peek inside the curtains. There are moments. There are big moments of anxiety and doubt and depression. It may be small little peeks, but they are enough to paint a picture of the man and his relationship with his wife. Those extra paint colors really sets off the climatic musical performance.",False
5,6,American Symphony,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not being terribly steeped in my ""American Roots"" I was wondering just who Jon Batiste actually was and whether, Aaron Copland-style, we were going to get a modern day illustration of a man writing an art-form that would seem to have long gone out of fashion for the mainstream audiences to whom his Grammy-nominated music appealed. Sadly, not. What we get here is rather muddled documentary that tries to show us a little of the real man, of his wife Suleika - who is undergoing some pretty torrid treatment for leukaemia - all whilst we watch him write, have rather pained sessions with his shrink - ""this is the train you are on!"" but actually we see precious little of just how the man functions as a musician. As a creator of what he hopes will be a modern orchestral masterpiece to be showcased at a full Carnegie Hall, we just don't get anything like close enough to what makes him tick, what inspires his creativity. Clearly lockdown didn't help - nor are face masks great for microphones capturing dialogue - but the whole thing is a sprawl of a film that actually left me feeling that Batiste was a man who vacillated from the earnest to the entertaining as if it were a switch that was being turned on. Some of the hospital scenes were just downright intrusive - I felt distinctly uncomfortable being a fly on the wall for some of the consultations! I fear the technical simplicity of creating these sort of access all areas, fly-on-the-wall, documentaries is going to lead to many more of them in the coming years, but if they are to work they really do need a strong, independent, director who can construct a narrative that informs the audience, not just showcases the personality of star. It's worth a watch, I suppose, but there's not too much symphonic going on.",False
6,10,Incredibly moving,bdb-76814,n/a,16/08/2025,"Suleika and Jon are each incredible, multi-talented artists and we see that in this film. But beyond their talents, we see the incredible people they are and the incredible love that they share with each other and with the world all while going through tough challenges with her health.I cried throughout this movie. It's been a while since a show... and these two beautiful people...moved me like this.Thank you for sharing this, for being who you are, and for showing us what's possible when you open your heart and allow yourself to be vulnerable. I will watch this again and I urge others to watch it.",False

8,4,Emotionally manipulative,deanosuburbia,n/a,16/08/2025,"A self indulgent delve into an artist who is clearly talented. I don't profess to know anything about Jon Batiste, I have heard his name mentioned every now and then. The synopsis for this documentary described it as deeply intimate but that intimacy is mostly at the mercy of carefully set up scenes in my opinion. Batiste seems like a nice man but my word the makers of this documentary made him look like a bit of a self centred and pretentious individual.It got about an hour in and I found myself talking to the screen, clearly I wasn't falling for the nonsense. I must say that the film picked up from the Grammy awards section onwards, which is good as at that point I was verging on awarding the film a 1 star review. Jon's wife Suleika Jaouad was clearly going through a terrible cancer ordeal of which I have full empathy. I did find a lot of the scenes extremely set up especially the wedding, some of the hospital sequences and Jon on the phone to his therapist.The part when he is performing at the piano (not during the power cut) and he waits for what feels like an eternity to begin to play was something of a low point. The audience didn't look too thrilled to watch his show.I am unlikely to further my education into Batiste, but I am happy to part company with him knowing that I didn't dislike him as much as I did during the first hour of this documentary, than I did at the end.At one point his wife mentions that the music playing is ""emotionally manipulative"", I think this sums up American Symphony perfectly.",False
9,10,"Jon is a musician's musician, this film is an artist's art",hopemustakim,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have thoughts in response to the one review claiming it felt too staged / too amateur with camera angles that were out of focus or too close up, and the message didn't focus enough on ONE issue... but then the reviewer spoke on the few scenes that stuck out and made them feel deeply and we're beautifully filmed.Isn't that life?Isn't film... art?Art is supposed to be open to interpretation, and make you feel something personal to YOU, and not to lead you to extract something specific. The artist is simply expressing and hoping to evoke some type of feeling in you, but most painters/drawers/sculptors will never tell you what their art ""means."" They'll ask, ""what do you think it means? What does it speak to you?""
I think the way it was filmed though, is intentionally a representation of life. The director wasn't going for ""professional,"" clean, consistent, etc. It's apparent he was demonstrating the very thing Sulaika profoundly stated - ""I feel like we're living a life of contrasts.""
And THAT, to me, was THE main message of the movie. No, not just their relationship, cancer being so hard, him breaking molds and records as a Black artist, or that he's a ""broken"" man (which... If that's what you considered broken, you must be living under a rock lol). He's a man who feels deeply but his brain sometimes gets anxious when he isn't staying present in his body, in his soul, in his inner knowing that everything is always changing. ""God gives and takes away"", he said in one scene. Coming to grips with that, and practicing non-attachment, is key. Especially considering the immense amount of pressure he was under, his anxieties are normal and real. This is the human condition. His wife is also a woman who feels deeply, and is very intentional about not wanting to NOT feel every ounce of the highs and lows of life that make it the HUMAN experience. (notice Jon's band is named ""Stay Human""?)This film reminded me of my deep love and connection with music, HOW it saved me at many points in life, and how and why cultures and traditions across the globe find peace, strength and joy in it and through it. Resilience, hope, and relief.And how sometimes in the most intimate, honest moments of expression, there just aren't words to suffice. Silence spoke so loudly in this film and that touched me deeply.Lastly, i want to speak on how this reviewer called Jon pretentious. I wonder how Jon's jubilant, confident, cool demeanor would be received if he weren't a Black man from New Orleans. Sure, he knows he's a genius. Good for him! And he also gives honor and credit to God/Source and the people who have shaped him. Why is it a bad thing that a little Black boy grew up with the acute awareness of just how excellent and magical he is? Is he not kind? Generous, encouraging? Loving? What is it about the way that he carries himself that is negative? He is a young King that honors his queen and loves people deeply. (We can all think of another intelligent, cool, confident, witty Black male who has been in the spotlight since 2008 who also was called ""pretentious."" smh.)
I don't imagine the reviewer shared the same skin tone as Jon. But if so, there's an internalization of a mindset that's caused them to play small their whole lives that they're projecting outwardly. And if not, I think the subconscious concern is more about how dangerous it is when people of Color, especially Black folks, know just HOW brilliant they are, and ACT on it with full faith and confidence. It shifts the frequency of the entire globe, and that shifts power. And people who have historically held all of it, don't want that change. But like Jon said in the beginning of the movie, (summarizing here:) we're all a part of something happening in and around us, an unfolding. A shift. Whether we want to see and acknowledge it or not.",False
10,5,Why did it have to get to me?,mickeythechamp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Once again, I am trying to get ahead of the Oscars and watch some of the movies on the short lists that are out. This time around I'll start chronologically with what I found, so that's the best documentary and this is the first on the list.So American Symphony is a doc I had to really let hit me over time. After my initial watch I was not impressed and had a lot of problems with it, especially for it being a documentary, but then some of it´s elements stuck with me and there are moments filmed here that really got to me. It made me lover my guard a bit and appreciate it a bit more. I still have a lot of issues with it, but I most say it´s worth a watch.The musician Jon Batiste is working on his next big thing, a symphony called ""American Symphony"". At the same time, his partner is going through cancer treatment.This documentary has one of my deadly sins when it comes to the documentary style. To me, you really have to be careful when it comes to framings, question and footage, as to not make it too fiction filmy and this movie has a bit too many scenes that feel and looks too set-up by the crew and the people involved. It is a tough balancing act to show reality in an interesting way and making a compelling narrative, and this movie fails to convince me that it isn't set up. Look, I know nearly all documentaries have some elements of authenticity that feels tampered with, but a good documentary makes you forget that you are looking at a guy asking leading questions and editing. This is as said the hardest part of doing a documentary, but there is just too much forced footage here.The only thing I found authentic, but super annoying, was the ugly camera work. Seriously, there are so many out of focus elements, too many ugly frames, so many close-ups. While it makes it feel more real, it feels more like a kid picked up a camera and filmed a home video rather than a professional documentary.I think another huge problem is the story it wants to tell here. It is a movie about the hardships of cancer, about making it as a black creator, about a symphony and about a broken man. It just never really focuses on one grand aspects and becomes more like a following a person for a year and edit together what we got. Furthermore, it's like the editor didn't know what they wanted either out of the movie. Because there are some excellent aspects here, and focusing on just one of the elements mentioned above would be sufficient for a documentary. It also makes the doc feel longer than it is.Following a guy like Jon Batiste is interesting, and I feel like I got to know a person I knew nothing about a little but better. He seems like such a life happy guy and someone that is hard to beat out of course. That's why it´s interesting to see him being challenged to the max here. I also found him extremely pretentious as a person, but that's more of a personal gripe with him. We need to see all facets of the person we are following in a doc to really make it feel real.But the doc got to me as said. After thinking about what I saw, a couple of aspects touched me. The dancing sequence. Jon playing this wife. It really moved me and created aspects of finding cinema in reality. The way it´s framed and pretend is absolutely high filmmaking, and that comes from a documentary I was a bit frustrated about to begin with.For these few incredible moments, American Symphony is worth watching. Sure I have a lot of issues with it, but not every movie gets under my skin like this did and that I admire movies for, when they actually make us think and feel. This doc can seem kind of amateurish at times, but that also raises the authentic moments a bit. I don't know, it´s a mixed bag, but one that got to me in the end.So, Oscar predictions. Since I only know this is on the short list, it´s hard to guess what will happen. I think this might have a chance to be nominated, but I surely hope there is a better documentary from last year than this, even tough I see the emotional value in this and some clear elements that will speak to the comity. There is also some behind the scenes aspects in terms of people knowing each other that makes me think this might have a chance of being nominated and winning, but I surly hope there is something a bit stronger this year.",False

It is a must see inspirational testament to overcoming insurmountable obstacles and turning poison into potion. Watching the story arch build you get an intimate peak inside what makes Jon Baptiste, the person behind the music, and his highly collaborative creative process. As well as Jon Batiste the family man.

12,10,Felt all the feelings,moviesbio,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jon Batiste was first imprinted in my mind during Covid when The Stephen Colbert Show closed for the night. The undeniable positive, creative energy. A beautiful human who heals souls. I am not a religious person but now and again you come across humans who are just that.Clearly the documentary shows you the other side and the very real struggle to not only helplessly stand by while your partner suffers but everything else. Eternal hope and realism and pure love.This was my first introduction to Suleika. What a force and gorgeous artist. She makes me want to pick up my paint brushes again.They are making quite an imprint in this world. Individually and ultimately together.Thank you for making this movie.

13,10,Not at all what I expected but exactly what I needed!,pamelatak,n/a,16/08/2025,"What was I expecting? The typical rock star vibe, I guess. Absolutely wrong! Not even close. This is an amazing film about a person who is more than we suppose him to be.John Baptiste is an amazing human, amazing musician, so much feeling expressed through thoughts, actions, movement, embracing everyone, leading everyone. Feeling expressed as action, music, words, thoughts. It is a heavy burden to carry. This film portrays all of this so well that you feel what is happening. You do not just watch it. And it is not all happy but it is moving towards a better outcome.Now, I want to know more about this interesting person through his music, through his good works, through his writing. Our world is made better, larger with him in it, I feel somehow. I need to experience his music to understand more. And this film, this documentary, is an exceptional way to experience the mystery that is John Baptiste.",False
14,10,Powerful and Moving,deesestone,n/a,16/08/2025,"What can I say? This movie was amazing. I couldn't watch it in one sitting, that is how powerful it is. Both of these people are amazing, her simply admirable and him also, supporting her, living two lives as he puts it - one the fame and the glory and then the real life with her, the reality of her illness, it made me cry. They are both so talented and supportive of each other -- puts your faith back in love. I always thought him amazing but when I found out about her, I was blown away, she really is, as the Doctor says, unique. I love her art and how she uses it to help her through the rough times. A beautiful woman in all respects.As to the symphony itself, hard to judge that except to know he is very talented.",False

In the sadness there is joy to be found. You can not watch this without seeing John Babtist and his partner as pure joy. For in even the darkest times there is joy. That's the theme here and it's beautiful. As a documentary I'd say it's more of a piece of art than a documentary. Touching at every turn. The good the bad , the really bad and the well deserved super good! Watch the first 10 minutes and you'll know if it's for you. I'm betting it is. I'm betting on you. By the end you'll be feeling the increased desire to be the best you can be, find your love, be a blessing to others and find the joy. Bravo!!!",False

His wife, Suleika Jaouad, who he met during their years at Julliard, gets a second cancer diagnosis (leukemia) after being in remission for a decade & now needs a second bone marrow transplant. At the same time Batiste is up for a record number of Grammy's, including Album of the Year, where he's favored to win a buttload as he also mounts a performance of the titular work at Carnegie Hall during the Co-vid wave. What becomes an odyssey of perseverance for both parties is a testament to the enduring love between two individuals going through the direst of pressures that would kill lesser couples w/good music (& art from Jaouad who takes to painting canvases during her hospital downtime) thrown in to boot & not let the viewer drift into maudlin depression.

17,9,"A beautiful, touching, and insightful documentary...",mdw0526,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film was our pick for a recent Sunday matinee and was a good choice for a sunny afternoon with bad air quality. It was a documentary about the super-talented Jon Batiste and his creation of a symphony to be performed at Carnegie Hall. But it was also about the unexpected recurrence of his partner's (and now wife's) cancer from a decade ago. I love movies about the artistic process and how artists and musicians create their work, and this didn't disappoint in any regard. Batiste is a joyful, uplifting person no matter what they're going through and the love and compassion they have for each other is truly inspiring.This is from the Obamas' production company, Higher Ground, and you can see their spirit if not their hand in the finished product. We weren't sure if we were going to enjoy this as we thought it would be sad, but it was ultimately beautiful, touching, and insightful. It's a bummer it didn't get a Best Documentary Oscar nom but I definitely recommend it, playing on Netflix.",False
18,10,powerfully beautiful love letter to art and music,stevencsmovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sometimes people need a reminder that art is subjective. It's never just one thing. Everybody has their own interpretation of a piece of art or a piece of music, even a piece of cinema. That's the beauty of it. It depends on feeling. The new documentary AMERICAN SYMPHONY is a love letter to the art of music and its various meditative facets. It focuses on musician Jon Batiste and his life partner, author Suleika Jaouad, as they navigate through a harrowing experience together using different forms of art. This is a beautiful movie, somehow being both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. It's edited so well I was entranced the entire time. Jon is a unique individual. I've been a fan of his since he was the band leader for Stephen Colbert's late night talk show. Since then, he's won multiple awards for his music. I love how Jon uses music as a coping mechanism, expressing his complex feelings through his music. In the public eye, he's so positive and upbeat. This movie lets us see all sides of him. Everybody has problems, obstacles they face as they go through life, and various ways of overcoming them. I guess you can say mine are movies and video games, escaping to another world for a bit. Wow, that got deep. I never really thought about that before. Huh. Self-therapy aside, AMERICAN SYMPHONY is the best documentary I've ever seen, and I believe it's a must-see. I'm absolutely shocked it's not nominated for Best Documentary Feature! You can find it on Netflix now!",False
19,10,this is what should be,lee_eisenberg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jon Batiste has been famous for a few years as the lead musical performer on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"", but you might not have known much about his personal life. ""American Symphony"" is a look at his personal life, his musical talent, and his wife Suleika's battle with cancer. Basically, Batiste's passion for music is rivaled only by his love of his wife. Over the course of the documentary, it becomes clear that Batiste is one of the great minds of our era (as if we didn't already know that).All in all, this is a true masterpiece. Everyone who wants to know anything about real music - the kind that comes from the soul as opposed to getting mass-produced - should see the documentary.

21,9,I cried at the end,keshawndevon,n/a,16/08/2025,"I believe documentaries about music artists and their projects can sometimes be very difficult to succeed in since they're such different forms of creating; one is recording and using what you have available to create or reveal a narrative, while the other is actively creating through experimentation surrounded by themes, topics, specific expressions, etc. But, this documentary does both beautifully, connecting the two in a unique way. Watching the film I felt I could read the music score actively while the scenes played out, attaching what felt like the intention behind the music to what was on the screen. This created an overall cohesive narrative that absorbed you in his world. But not only just visually, emotionally too.",False
22,8,Quite Touching,Hitchcoc,n/a,16/08/2025,"When evaluating a show such as this one needs to separate the subject matter from the success of the film. I really like John Batiste (although there are times when his honking and shouting get to be a bit much). I also was not aware of his wife's leukemia that took a good deal of joy from the equation. This was his best year ever, winning all those Grammies and performing his Symphony. My only hesitation has to do with the editing and some of the concert material. Things were a bit jumpy and disjointed at times. I was a little disappointed in how the final performance was put on film. Anyway, I remain a big fan and look forward to his next major work.",False

My Rating 7.5/10
NetflixAnother fine documentary produced by the American Film and Television company Higher Ground Productions founded in 2018 by former American President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.The goal of their company is to lift up diverse voices in the entertainment industry.I've been impressed with other of their documentaries such as Becoming, 2020 Descendant 2022 and the Oscar winning 2020 documentary American Factory all from this production company

""Soul"" Jon Batiste begins to compose a classical American Symphony hence the title . He also wants to have it performed at the famous Carnegie Hall in New York which it was in September 2022 with a 63 person performing ensemble .He even gave up his lucrative band leader gig on The Stephen Colbert Late Show to have time to devote to his composing and support Suleika his wife with her illness.It's a very inspiring documentary I always enjoy learning about new music and the musician's that create it no matter if it's not in my spectrum of appreciation so I recommend American Symphony.",False

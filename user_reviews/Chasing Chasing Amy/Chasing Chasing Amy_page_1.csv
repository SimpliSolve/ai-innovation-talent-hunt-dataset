1,9,When You Outgrow Your Lifeboat,JasonScott,n/a,16/08/2025,"What's special about Sav's documentary is how effectively he shows how a flawed inspiration is still an inspiration, and coming to terms with that is everything. The film is about Chasing Amy, but also much more about what Chasing Amy represents and what place it held in the world, and since. At the center of the documentary, though, is Sav. We go on a journey of Sav's life and progression in this film, and when Kevin Smith (and Joey Lauren Adams) have his back, you know it's going to be a great one.The documentary is polished to perfection and told from the heart. A definite critical addition to the View Askewniverse canon.",False
2,10,"An honest, real, inspiring story",micahself,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw chasing chasing Amy with my sister to support her as she's recently come out. I am a straight, white man but I found the movie very relatable and moving despite its focus on the LGBTQ+ community. It was very honest and vulnerable and true to the human experience. Sav Rodgers does an incredible job balancing his own story and growth throughout the movie with others input and personal experiences. I hadn't seen chasing Amy before seeing chasing chasing Amy (I have seen it now), but Sav's vulnerability to show his emotions and highs and lows made that a non-issue. You can't help but be caught up in Sav's excitement, joyous spirit, and energy while also relating to his struggles and fears. I cannot express what a positive impact this movie can have for so many people.",False
3,n/a,I blame the goatee,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI loved the documentary. I too had my Ben Affleck phase when I was growing up. And now I'm a queer woman, so it was a nice touch, a nice memory.I was a child when I watched Chasing Amy, and I remember liking it, but something felt off... Now I can figure it out, of course.It's a very honest documentary, with a lot of different perspectives, and very touching.I really resonate with Kevin Smith's brother because when I watch movies I can put myself in them -- a white man, a straight couple, a horse (I love you, Bojack).And the plot of the movie mirroring Rodgers' life is almost uncanny. I mean, his wife identifies as a queer woman, even though she's married to a man and that's ok!So all these stories of humans and love, that's what matters, after all (I know it's a cliche and saying that some cliches are true is also a cliche, but I'm standing by my words at the moment).",True

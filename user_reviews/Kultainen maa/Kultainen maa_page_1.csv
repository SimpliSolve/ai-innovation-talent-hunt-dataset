1,9,Very interesting,ArisSil,n/a,17/08/2025,"The documentary is referring to various issues both in Finland (I thought this country doesn't exist) for immigrants and in Somalia with corruption. My objection is that I would like to get something more. I felt that it scratches the surface of these problems, although to be fair it was not the theme of the documentary to analyze them. I just wanted more explanations.The documentary follows Mustafe Hassan and his family that they decide to move to Somalia to exploit their literally Golden Land. I really enjoy this trip through this reverse immigration and especially of the way the kids were treating the whole situationAfrica is the richest continent in the world and it is too bad that African people are not the ones to take advantage of it. This is actually the story of African people to take advantage of their own land!",False

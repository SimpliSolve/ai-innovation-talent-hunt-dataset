1,8,Very Interesting,Mehki_Girl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPrimarily we have talking heads; but we also very a lot of footage that was carefully chosen and edited to tell the story of the upbringing and character of Prince Andrew, described variously as spoiled, handsome (when young), good soldier, the queen's favorites, old fat, out of shape, gray, the spare heir, self entitled, a wannabe, sleezy, inappropriate, broke, dependant on mummy, weird (what's up with the teddy bears?), rude, stupid, an idiot, a sexual predator, a liar, etc.There's one hilarious scene when they name the guestlist for one of Epstein, a convicted sexual offender's, parties, that read like the who's who of sexual predators! The only one missing from the list was Roman Polanski!Highly recommended, if only for purient interests. The queen backed up her favorite son for as long as she could until Prince Andrew's predatory tactics and idiot moves in the press became too much and she dumped him and basically kicked him to the curb.Mummy and daddy are dead now and the rest of the family wants nothing to do with him, so... What's next?",True
2,8,The Spare Is Snared . . . .,sundayatdusk-97859,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is a decent enough overview of the life of Prince Andrew and his fall from grace. Even though some of the topics are indecent, this Peacock documentary deserves much credit for refraining from using indecent language and photographs. (Some of the photographs are a bit risque, but not too much.)We basically learn Prince Andrew was his mother's favorite, was spoilt, had a purpose in life when he was in the Navy, and it all went downhill after he left the Navy. He liked the good life, but did not have his older brother's money or position in life. This resulted in very bad choices, including a close friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.The film jumps around in its interviews with various individuals, but not in a confusing way, like so many other documentaries of its type. It does focus on his ""sex addiction"" and Virginia Giuffre's lawsuit, but, once again, not in a sensationalized way. Peacock does indeed deserve praise for not making a sleazy type film, but one that provides a lot of facts, as well as a concise picture of Prince Andrew's life.",False
3,6,I was excited to see this but... was disappointing.,LukeCustomer2,n/a,16/08/2025,"A lot of the Jeffrey Epstein docs are disappointing because there really is no information. This too is similar. The people they interview are mostly people who don't have any actual information and are largely speculating based on what they know. Here we talk to people like Tina Brown and Dickie Arbiter. They don't know that much.We go through the history of Andrew and, if you don't know this stuff, it might be interesting but most of what they cover we already know. There is no one they talk to who knows Andrew and can offer meaningful reasons why this stuff happened. Or even offer any defense. For instance, the. Virginia Giuffre lawsuit was settled when Andrew's team demanded the original photo of her and Andrew... humn... does seem that is evidence the photo was doctored but no one is touching that fact.Just a very basic shallow documentary, piling on to the news that is already out there.",False
4,7,A few new facts and revelations,catnapbc,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAlthough it might have been more informative within a longer format, this short documentary does give a fairly good overview of the whole sordid downfall of this particular 'ex-royal'. Like numerous others of his ilk (most recently ex-king Juan Carlos of Spain), many of these privileged and 'entitled' (in their own minds) types squander whatever advantages they have. In Andrew's case, it seems he just wasn't interested in being an active participant in the British royal family's many public duties and instead remained the spoiled, narcissistic and immature 'boy' who just wanted to play. The most revealing aspect of this documentary, because I didn't see or hear it, was his self-appointed interview, which clearly showed an uncomfortable and evasive ageing playboy trying to cover his tracks. His stuttering and incomplete answers, as well as his body language, spoke volumes. You can blame his mother, the pressures of the position, the lack of purpose, but in the end, he had and made choices that he alone must take responsibility for. To feign naivety and innocence about Epstein and Maxwell's activities around the many very young women is just laughable. Sad too, as he seems to lack both intellect and common sense when it comes to life outside the structure of the palace or the navy. This man lost his way early on but always chose the path of least resistance. Being a royal is not an enviable position, but his brothers have shown a different course, and he has no one to blame but himself.",True
5,7,Consequences indeed,magdalena-80416,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA boy who grew up in a world where there was no consequences, and became a childish man who STILL believed he didn't had to front some consequences...Then consequences will bite you in your royal arse and when he then did front them, he didn't know how to and then his hiddious persona was on every front page in the world and he still kept on lying because he i the Royal Favourite!!!Mummy will make everything right, but this time mummy said ""you're on your own, I can't help you. I have to save the crown, and compare to the crown; you are negligible.""
So the spare bacame very much used and sacrificed to the media.",True
6,10,An idiotic narcissist,roxlerookie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very interesting documentary. One wonders how Prince Andrew s life would have turned out had he married this pretty actress Koo Stark.The documentary shows how a spoiled child is literally spoiled, like rotten.A mother who had him as her favourite for understandable reasons. An environment where nobody will ever tell you anything but ""yes"". The pain inherent to being a number two (think of that South park episode with Bono).It was clearly very easy to find people close to him to talk smack, so much that it was quite remarkable. In fact, it's mentioned several times that nobody liked or likes the guy, which is made very understandable.The poor guy ends up looking like an entitled imbecile with no redeeming qualities. You would have thought that over the years he'd have had the smarts to get involved with a noble cause, not unlike Alfred Nobel wanting to NOT be remembered as the guy who invented TNT, or so many (all?) billionaires attaching their names to well-meaning foundations.But not Prince Andrew, apparently. Just a sad horny intellectually inferior narcissistic loser in a downward spiral, whose life peaked as a helicopter pilot when Britain was still waging wars.The saddest thing of all: how much sleep did his shenanigans cost the Queen, and therefore did he precipitate her passing? Hard not to think about that after watching this documentary, given the sequence of events.I'm not surprised that rich men are horny and that vulnerable women are preyed on by powerful men, because I don't live under a rock. But the depiction of sense of entitlement, stupidity and lifelong series of poor decisions of that man was really quite staggering.",False

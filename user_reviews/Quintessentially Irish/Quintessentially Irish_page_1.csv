1,1,Quintessentially NONSENSE,slydon13,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm an Irish woman. Born here, raise here, lived abroad but working here again now. All my family are Irish.This 'documentary' includes more than 5 male people who are listed as participating , only one of them has ever claimed to being Irish (in fairness, Mr Irons is living here and can claim honorary status). However Sinead Cusack is in fact Irish and isn't known to be camera shy. Surely her contribution would have been valuable ! Instead they invited her more famous English husband's opinion.If you watch the thing, contributions of hardly any women were included, when Ireland is 51% female. The contribution of any famous man who may or may not have encountered an Irish person in his life, was ranked.How would Mr Bolt feel if I (a white Irish woman) had an opinion on what was ' Quintessentially Black'?? Or 'Quintessentially Athletic'?? I've never been to Jamaica but let me share my opinion, based on bobsledding movies !!!Even that image on the cover is more 'Disney diddlie iddleie' than actually Irish!Grace Kelly's grand parents were Irish (and moved to the US) so her son' great grand parents were Irish. This certainly doesn't make his opinion of what is 'Irish' more useful than all the women actually living in Ireland.I suspect somebody wanted an excuse to spend time with famous people and he cooked up this excuse. Perhaps his next project will be interviewing male supermodels to answer for the definition of 'Quintessentially female'.Now - if you are happy to hear what famous people (who are mostly older non-Irish men ) think it means to be Irish, then this is the documentary for you. Perhaps you'd be the kind of person when told its lucky to grope the statue of Molly Malone, you'd think that's OK.From start to finish the thing is offensive to Irish people and Irish women in particular.",True

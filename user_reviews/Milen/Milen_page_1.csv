1,10,Impressive person well documented,linskiden,n/a,15/08/2025,"I learned a lot about the personality of this well known, highly respected and loved by the auditory journalist. His personal life was never of my concern, but I appreciate knowing something about his family and friends too. It is a great representation of the life of a person who we all miss, because he was always sincere and professionally out-of-the-box.It shares the story of most journalists living in a post-communism countries in eastern Europe. Although it is never mentioned, the freedom of speech is the main topic that holds the line. Milen is an example of a journalist loyal to his values and moral comy. He would speak his mind.",False
2,9,Milen deserves this movie,annie_ne,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was extremely enjoyable to immerse myself in this film about the man who not only changed television in Bulgaria. He was an extraordinary innovator in his time. Disruptive, outspoken, always with an opinion of his own. Unaware of limitations. In those years, I only watched him, apart from movies. Many of the students in my university years also watched only him. I remained his faithful viewer over the years, no matter what time they moved his show. And unfortunately, I also sadly saw how the reality in the country gradually changed him. In those days everyone is loud, everyone has his own platform, but in the years when the so called democracy came in Bulgaria, he was revolutionary.",False
3,10,Exceptional,krasi_asenova,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat an awesome production! Unable to shake what I saw two hours after the movie's ending. It was that good.The movie follows the incredible life and career journey of one of very few true and honest Bulgarian journalists. The content is well structured and perfectly conveys the authors' ideas. This is not just a movie about the exceptional character of a fearless, ambitions, real journalist; it is also a documentary about the reality of politically oppressed journalism - how political powers can crush even the strongest, but not for long. Milen was charismatic, witty, strong minded, creative and very determined to follow his high standards at work, undeterred by external forces. Respect to this awesome human being! He won't be forgotten!",True

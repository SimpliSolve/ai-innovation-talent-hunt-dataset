1,5,Not worth your time!,movfun,n/a,16/08/2025,"As much as I love Barcelona and Messi, this movie is in no way a justice to the greatest player ever. I mean honestly speaking some of the youtube videos have better production quality and content. No goal clips, no new messi interviews. I mean i saw at least a few frames that were repeated more than 10 times. Just a journalist speaking in background and reciting the wikipedia page of Lionel Messi.",False
2,4,Messi is the GOAT but this documentary is the WORST.,lironos,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well, it's not the worst, but it's doing injustice to his legacy and lack storytelling.Messi is definitely the best club player in history, but this documentry is doing him a lot of injustice, beacuse it's not even a compilation of his career and goals but rather a dull representation of his Balon d'Or wins and goals, without even showing them, and totally not inspiring even a bit. I will wait for the better documentry, whenever it will be.At least in the documentries of Messi vs. Ronaldo - Cristiano wins, which at least his documentary from 2015 was a bit inspiring.",False
3,1,Shocking Documentary,mccrossanclive,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary about one of the greatest footballers, that doesn't show him playing any football, was expecting to see clips of him as he progressed from a young boy in Argentina to the supertar he turned out to be, instead i got freeze frame pictures, and stock clips..turned it off after 15 min.",False
4,3,Don't bother,jasond-646-416610,n/a,16/08/2025,"As another reviewer said, poorly put together film. Was looking forward to it, but very disappointing.Nothing new, poorly edited, the time frame jumps about for no reason or explanation. No original images, film or interviews bar one reporter. A few low resolution (seemingly) hastily grabbed from YouTube goals.Then lastly, the same stock video cut scenes over and over!Save yourself an hour and don't waste your time on this.",False
5,1,Don't bother the movie isn't realistic,cesarluisbarrera,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're looking for random paragraphs, you've come to the right place. When a random word or a random sentence isn't quite enough, the next logical step is to find a random paragraph. We created the Random Paragraph Generator with you in mind. The process is quite simple. Choose the number of random paragraphs you'd like to see and click the button. Your chosen number of paragraphs will instantly appear.While it may not be obvious to everyone, there are a number of reasons creating random paragraphs can be useful. A few examples of how some people use this generator are listed in the following paragraphs.Creative Writing
Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.Tackle Writers' Block
A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a completely random paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been causing the writers' block in the first place.Beginning Writing Routine
Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose here is to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their fingers.Writing Challenge
Another writing challenge can be to take the individual sentences in the random paragraph and incorporate a single sentence from that into a new paragraph to create a short story. Unlike the random sentence generator, the sentences from the random paragraph will have some connection to one another so it will be a bit different. You also won't know exactly how many sentences will appear in the random paragraph.",False

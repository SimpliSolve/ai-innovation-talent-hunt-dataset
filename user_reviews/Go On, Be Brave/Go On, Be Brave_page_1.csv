1,10,A Must-See to Get Filled Up on Inspiration!,colette-75830,n/a,16/08/2025,"Go On, Be Brave is a gem of a film. From the very start, it pulls you in and takes you on a journey that truly touches all of the emotions...joy, grief, laughter, frustration, anger and then joy again.Andrea's story is one that has stopped me in my tracks and inspired me to consider the world around me and be ok with it. Because in spite of the simply incredible challenges that lie in her path, Andrea rises up, grabs life by the eggs, gives a middle finger to her disease and simply crosses every finish line she sets out to cross. And she does it all while bearing an intoxicating smile and surrounded by a tribe who are in big love with who appears to be a superhuman.I love this film, the story, the people...and watching it was good for my soul. <3.",False
2,10,Beautiful film. Incredible story. Gorgeously shot.,thorsten_kessler,n/a,16/08/2025,"Go On, Be Brave tells the story of Andrea Lytle Peet, and her courageous attempt to be the first person diagnosed with ALS to complete a marathon in all 50 states. Filmed over several years and all over the US, Andrea is joined by her team (husband, mother, doctors, physical therapists, and friends) in documenting the incredible journey she takes. The filmmakers crafted a movie with incredible shots, showcasing the beauty of the human soul and pitting that against the devastating effects ALS has on thousands of people. While introducing us to a hero, it also carefully introduces us to a community of fighters, many of whom have lost their battle but whose stories live on through their work to help find a cure and impact they have had on the community. The film takes us on a journey. Not just through the hills, mountains, streets, woods, and other beautiful landscapes and terrains Andrea battles through but also the journey into the lives people with ALS and the struggle they face each day. The film is a love letter to life itself and a reminder to appreciate what you have while you have it. And if there's something you want, to never give up. You might even surprise yourself discovering what all you are capable of.",False

4,10,Triumph of the Human Spirit,aaronbednar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Regardless of your interest level in ALS specifically, this film is well worth watching. It is more than just a feel good flick, a motivational goal-setting film, or a deep-dive on a specific medical condition.The film is a deep exploration of human struggles against physical problems and emotional discouragement, pushing yourself to find meaning, the power of human connections, and a beautiful love story between two people facing unexpected difficulties and disappointments.I watched it last night in a private showing, and I will definitely watch it again!

5,10,Wonderfully done and important documentary!,laurenekulp,n/a,16/08/2025,"An inspiring documentary of a woman in her 30s who receives one of the worst diagnoses that anyone could: ALS. This film follows her spirit and journey as she refuses to succumb to an inactive and depressed life, and to continue on towards her goal to complete a marathon in all 50 states. The film blends helpful information to those who may be less familiar with ALS with the raw, intimate, and powerful personal story of Andrea and her countless and dedicated team of supporters. This film would be a worthy and wonderful addition to the documentaries found on Netflix. It is impossible to watch this film and not become part of Team Drea.",False
6,10,Incredible story,DianeHDDS,n/a,16/08/2025,"An extremely moving documentary detailing Andrea's decision to live her life fully after being diagnosed with ALS rather than waiting to die. She set a goal to complete a marathon in every state! If you have completed even one marathon, you know how challenging it is, let alone attempting one in every state....and with the onset of covid causing races to be cancelled, taking away precious time, she continues to push forward with incredible determination! Amazing to watch the ups and downs and with the support of her husband, family, and friends manages to keep a smile on her face and a sense of humor. She should be dead by now given the usual path of ALS but she continues to defy the odds to the amazement of her doctors. We can all learn from Andrea! This is a must see film!",False

A must see for anyone!,jodi-54570,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film was a soul lifter and heart fulfiller!Andrea has stepped outside of her ALS diagnosis and spread her wings to fly. Watching the endless stream and support of so many people along the way, showing up with determination and faith, gave me hope. Hope in humanity, at a time where I feel so much is lost. It inspired me stronger to conquer my own fears and not allow them to define me. I filled with so much pride as I have been beside one of my dear friends, who also is fighting the battle of ALS. Trying to live out loud, every second she has, in this beautiful and tragic life! So grateful to have seen this film at the Santa Barbara Film festival.This film is for anyone.

The struggles and triumphs of Drea and her husband were inspiring and accurately displayed. I did not want my journey with this family to end. I felt attached to their story and hope we can continue to follow the way the attack and overcome the obstacles and curveballs life throws their way. The documentary is honest and you feel acutely the frustrations they face while trying to achieve such an incredible goal. The beauty of their story isn't necessarily in the happy ending, or having things go perfectly their way - it's about embracing the journey and finding the silver linings.",False

11,10,Helps you to appreciate what you have in life,tag42481,n/a,16/08/2025,"When you're 33 years old, you're typically in a place where you're starting to think about expanding your family. You're typically not being diagnosed with a disease that gives you only 2-5 years of life expectancy. Andrea decided that she didn't want to wait around for ALS to claim her life. She decided to take on the goal of completing a marathon in every state on her recumbent trike, considering she was a triathlete before her diagnosis. Did she succeed? Well, this review doesn't contain spoilers. ;-)As another reviewer said, it will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you feel many other emotions along the way. About the only complaint that I can come up with is that footage from every state isn't included, but at the same time, I admit that's pretty implausible to do. The cinematography is stunning, particularly the drone shots from Alaska. INCREDIBLE!! The film is a great combination of sit-down interviews with Andrea and her husband Dave, several other family, friends, and doctors close to Andrea, and footage from several marathons themselves.I know the movie is still at the film festival stage, but I can't wait to get my hands on my own personal copy of the movie. As inspiration as it gets!",False

A must see!!!",rochegang,n/a,16/08/2025,"Go On, Be Brave tells the story of my niece Andrea and her attempt at completing 50 marathons in all 50 states while battling ALS.

13,10,"Inspirational, sports narrative which asks, ""What does it mean to truly live?""",susanswarner,n/a,16/08/2025,"Go On, Be Brave is a once-in-a-lifetime story about a woman with a terminal diagnosis triumphing against all odds and doing it with more joy and humor. Andrea Lytle Peet was diagnosed with ALS at 33. Rather than waiting to die, she made an impossible goal-to be the first person with ALS to complete 50 marathons in 50 fifty states. Andrea is charming, charismatic, and so damn competitive. Stories of women diagnosed with ALS are staggeringly few; to the filmmakers' knowledge, this is the first feature-length documentary film centered on a woman with ALS, told through the unique viewpoint of a female director.This film is a love letter to life. It's a love story between Andrea and her husband, Dave, and their deep and abiding commitment that refuses to give up. It is a love letter to her ALS community who respond to a diagnosis with ""you can steal everything from us, but you cannot steal our spirit."" The film transcends beyond a story of sport and disease, inspiring the audience to answer the universal question, ""what does it mean to truly live?""",False

It is suspenseful and heart warming, and appropriate for every age. Andrea's spectacular journey of persistence will help you redefine courage and grit. She will inspire every viewer to do something brave, and to more profoundly appreciate the gift of life. ALS has no power over her smashing, infectious smile.

16,10,Exceptional!,glennbutner,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGo On Be Brave tells the story of Andrea Peet's triumphs while struggling with ALS. At the most obvious level, Peet is pursuing her goal of completing a marathon in all fifty states, overcoming the health challenges of ALS, the bureaucratic hurdles of entering races using a trike, and the global challenge of Covid-19 shutting down races.

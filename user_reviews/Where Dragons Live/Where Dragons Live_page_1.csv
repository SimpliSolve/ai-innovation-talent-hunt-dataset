1,9,Gorgeous,imdbfan-903941,n/a,16/08/2025,"The children and grandchildren of a demanding couple are emptying their family home Oxford (United Kingdom) in order to sell it after their parent's death. During the emptying of this old, large manor house, many memories arise.The story in itself is one that everyone can relate to in regard of dealing with the good but also the rather less happy moments of one's upbringing, regardless of where you were born or what kind of background one has.But even apart from personal recognition, the way this documentary is shot (camera, lights, sounds) cannot be named anything else but distinctive. It's a monumental treasure.",False

1,10,Powerful story of survival,dacatplace,n/a,16/08/2025,First keep kleenex handy but the documentary is worth it! There was hope in the middle of the geartbreak of the fire that swept through Paradise CA. The cats. This is a powerful and at times heartbreaking story about the cats and the people who fought to save them. There are several stories about the surviving cats that will amaze you. There's also the tragic interference by the officials who claimed to want to help. It's worth watching and learning to see what can be done and to be aware of how to help should there be a fire near you. It's worth saving something small. I highly recommend this documentary.,False

3,10,Inspiring!,imabiah,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a terrific picture - moving, exciting, and a wonderful example of how we all of us can truly save lives and make a difference. Katharine and her crew have done a great job of finding, following, and supporting the folks who made it their mission to find and heal the many cats that were displaced in the horrific California wildfires. Their tenacity, compassion and courage are truly inspirational. I don't know what inspired Katharine to make this picture, but I'm grateful to her for doing it. Everyone involved in these cat rescues are heroes. There are no small acts of grace, and this movie proves it.",False
4,10,Astounding,sheilabusiness,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a real accounting by those involved. Love, dedication, perseverance, and unscathed volunteers are the hero's here. Cats with the opportunity and will to live are true survivors and show us what survival skills they have.This film was a major undertaking. The quality is top notch. Many parts made me feel like I was standing next to the volunteers as they worked. The dialogue during the filming gives us a closer feel of what the volunteers and cats were experiencing.I can't imagine how anyone could leave the theater, after watching this film, and not be emotionally effected.I urge everyone to go see ""The Fire Cats."" This is humanity at its finest and cats with an amazing will to live.",False
5,10,The Fire Cats-Save Something Small,awfspike-70975,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the best films I have ever seen. Grab your tissues, you will need it!! If you've ever have done cat rescue work or worked in wildfire zones, this is as real as it gets. Katharine Parsons gets it! She knows how to weave the story of the Tubbs and Camp Fire in a way to tug at your heart and also make you laugh. The entire cast is outstanding, but it's all about the amazing outworldly stories of the CATS and their stories of survival in unmentionable circumstances. Cat rescuers doing amazing things, to Save Something Small! This needs to be available to everyone to enjoy!!! Someone needs to make this available for the masses!!!",False
6,10,Bring Kleenex,paulasolomon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Never bet against a cat, you'll lose. The documentary focuses on the rescues of cats caught in the Paradise California fire, along with a few others. It also profiles a group who worked against the rescuers lying to the public, adding to the loss and grief. There is live footage of rescues amidst the ashes and toxic debris a fire leaves behind as well as touching reunions when owners could be found. Folks who lost everything getting back one piece of their lives, reuniting with their cats.The story is engaging and enraging, the videography is amazing, and the heroes who were profiled are exemplary humans.",False
7,10,The Fire Cats is a must see,thievincats,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie will tug at your every emotion. Very well done it plays out the scenarios that happen with each new wild fire. Focusing on the Camp fire and cat rescuer/whisperer Shannon Jay and several others the story is well told and shows many cat rescues and what these cats endured. It also delved into the controversy surrounding the situation. Getting quickly into fire areas is indeed important. We witness rescues and many cats being reunited with their families. The musical score and original song are wonderful. Keep the tissues handy, as it definitely will tug at your heartstrings. Not just for cat people but a great story for all.",False
8,10,"Fire Cats go take a friend, neighbor, or loved one!!",aprylmclark,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have fostered kitties through FieldHaven and live near the areas that were essentially wiped out by these fires. Being able to see Heroes rescuing loved family memebers while other heroes were putting out those fires was simply amazing. The compassion, persistence, and fearlessness that is shown by not only First Responders but every day Heroes is inspiring. Go see this movie! Be inspired! Reach out to your local organizations to make changes within your community regarding disaster situations and how they are handled. Register to be a local foster or safe haven for an animal. Step up, it takes all of us. Not just some of us.",False
9,10,Cats - the most amazing creatures,joy-81844,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dedicated to survival. This film spotlights the cats who have survived infernos and the brave, determined people who worked against the clock to rescue them. The cat owners who have lost everything, find solace in being reunited with their four-pawed family members. The film will tap into a multitude of emotions. You will cry, there's not doubt about it. But you'll also laugh, get angry, feel your heart melt but in the end you will be uplifted. So proud to have been a part of the efforts to save the tiny tigers and to help their human companions navigate the tragedy of the fire. Please see it when you can - you won't be disappointed.",False
10,10,Moving & Factual !! A Must See,nissap-26535,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have seen this movie 3 times. Each time I am transported back to the Camp Fire. The small victories when you get the call that an owner is found and on their way. When the cat you trapped looks so much like your cat; that every time you look at him, you cry.Every part of this film is real. I am grateful that the Heroes in the film actually represent all the rescuers: from Trapping, Sheltering, Matching, and Standing up for the right to save something small. Every part of this film actually shows the emotion and heart of all that answered the call to save something small. To save a Fire Cat and to restore a treasure to a family.",False
11,10,Gut Wrenching and Powerful,hxtrm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Films that document disasters rarely profile the animals involved. It is estimated that 800,000 animals perished in Katrina and not one film was made about the plight of the survivors. Luckily, Katherine Parsons came along and changed that with this film of another disaster, The Camp Fire. Her sensitive and intelligent coverage rings true for all of us that were involved. She also shines a light on governmental agencies that can obstruct rather than help simply due to the egos involved. Hopefully this film will act as a blueprint for disaster preparation in the future by showing how critical it is to make room for experienced trappers like Shannon Jay to do what they do best.",False
12,10,"One documentary you shouldn't miss watching, from sheer terror to grateful thanks, this film's true story affects all of us",furrydance,n/a,16/08/2025,"Living in Southern Oregon, always an area at risk for wild fires, and having cats of my own, one of my greatest fears is of losing them to a fire.The personal stories of loss and bravery in the face of danger, the dedication and perseverance of Shannon Jay and the rescuers gives me faith that there are angels among us!I was a veterinary healthcare professional for my entire career and continue to be involved in cats lives, either through volunteer work or sharing information that could better their lives. And I feel that this film will help many cats and their owners in the future, by bringing awareness to the effects of wildfires on both people and pets, and to the communities surrounded by wildfires devastation.",False
13,10,Heartbreaking. Authentic. Inspiring,bw_mail,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone should see this documentary. I left California before the horrific wildfires shown in this movie, the Tubbs Fire, Camp Fire, and so many others as flames roared on doorsteps and fleeing families couldn't always find frightened pets in the chaos of evacuation. This movie is about the many devoted people who went to ground zero to find and rescue pets, the supportive organizations who provided needed veterinary care, shelter for the rescued cats, the global social media community who worked to connect found pets with desperate families, and the organizations who worked against all these firecat warriors.",False
14,10,Such an Amazing Documentary,mudbloodgryffindor,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is captivating from the time the show begins until the credits are finished rolling. Having been from the area of Paradise, we witnessed on our television's what was happening in that hellscape. Being able to watch behind the scenes what the wonderful rescuers did in order to save the cat survivors will leave the viewer choked up with emotion. This is a must see 100%.Because of this documentary, I have gotten to know some of the rescuers, on line and one in real life. I have learned rescue tips and ways to get involved. I keep rewatching the Fire Cats and am moved over and over again.",False

1,4,Mike Just Wasn't As Funny This Time Around!,zac-68274,n/a,16/08/2025,"Funny at times but just didn't live up to his usual stand up comedy. The editing was horrible, a joke was even repeated twice. Netflix comedy has turned into money grabs with dry comedic routines.",False
2,5,Not his best material,alexlara-14712,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mike had his moments, not his best standup. Still enjoyable, and funny. He was happy to be home and perform in front of his hometown. Is always fun to see Mike.",False
3,6,This isn't his best work but is worth a viewing,kevin_robbins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mike Epps: Indiana Mike (2022) is a comedy special my wife and I recently watched on Netflix. Unfortunately we had seen Mike Epps on tour about 4-5 months ago in DC and heard a lot of this material already. There were a few new segments in this from the tour, but not many. I will say a lot of his COVID material was good. The Tik Tok and kids story was ""real life."" The running into Bill Cosby segment was funny and the R Kelly joke was hilarious. Overall I would say this isn't his best work but is worth a viewing. I would score this a solid 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",False
4,1,Not worth the watch,tinap-03909,n/a,16/08/2025,The man got paid either way.I like Mike Epps he's funny at times.. it seemed like he made up the whole show while on stage nothing planned or written just thinking off the top of his head and when a joke did land he just ran it again to get more laughs. I felt uncomfortable watching the struggle from one joke to the next.,False
5,1,Typical Netflix propped-up comedian,backup-50362,n/a,16/08/2025,"Zero comedy, you're watching a hype man from any random show ever, wasting time.Listing people in the audience and asking ""where they at"" for 20 minutes of a 50 minute show isn't a comedy special.",False
6,1,I honestly don't get how he managed to get famous,leon-zrile,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've seen 100+ stand up shows and this one is definitely in the top 10 worst ever. His earlier shows are there as well. I keep wathching his specials hoping that I will at least once see why did he become a star. I just can't get it.His material is virtually nonexistent. He just says n-word 10 thousand times, mentions relevant people from Indiana and keeps saying how Indiana is awesome and these are the only times he gets any reaction from the crowd. There are no jokes whatsoever. No bits to speak of. Nothing that would even make me chuckle.It made him chuckle, though, throughout the entire special. He laughed more at his ""material"" than anyone in the crowd. It's like he wasn't even trying. The fact that he has any amount of star power is baffling.I've been to open mics that were way funnier.",False
7,1,Have no idea why I watched another of his specials,paudieconnolly,n/a,16/08/2025,This really is one of the worst stand ups . I have seen introduction anyone laughing at himself to try to let the crowd know when it funny. I like Mike Epps in movies and fine him funny. But I don't know how he gets away with an hour of saying names.,False
8,2,Painful to watch,grfarra,n/a,16/08/2025,"How on earth is this on Netflix? It's so bad, I'm not sure it even qualifies as a stand up.It's not funny, just stupid stuff coming out of his mouth, there's nothing good or remotely funny. I'm not sure what the audience was laughing at even, a total disaster.",False
9,10,Love love love Mike Epps,mslovelyever,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very funny and a good time. He always have me rolling in tears. Crazy human being with a natural gift. He tells it how it is which I find to be bravery, especially in these times. Go Mike Epps!",False
10,1,Boring as usual,jsgzzxyrzh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really like him as a person, but he's incredibly boring at stand up. It also doesn't seem like his comedy has evolved- or ever will. Even as a host he gets boring.",False
11,5,Mike Epps is a Funny Guy,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mike Epps is a funny stand up. He is charming and likable in this stand up show from his birthplace, Indianapolis. This is adult humor. He is off color, but he is funny. A lot of humor is about relationships- casual or serious. He is also NOT politically correct, but he is funny. I like the physical aspects of his comedy as well as the words. The crowd adores him, and with good reason. A lot of social commentary. I like this a lot.",False
12,2,What happened to Stand-Up comedy?,colbertadrian,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another stand-up flop from a veteran performer, following the likes of Katt Williams, this was a disaster from start to finish, why do some comedians think it's funny to talk about the smell of a woman's private parts? It's so childish and insulting to the audience, this was by far his worst outing, like a relative telling random jokes at a family gathering, no setups or punchlines just off the top gibberish that goes nowhere, painful to watch another established comedian use his past fame to just do nothing new.",False

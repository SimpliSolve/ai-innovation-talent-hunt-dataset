5,10,Fabulous for the Disney Movie fan,david-39958,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoy movies. I love Disney movies. This series looks at some classics and looks for long lost props from those movies. Just like any movie/tv show you need to suspend some belief, but I don't mind. They were trying to tell a story about props in a compelling way. I'm sure they didn't just discover some long lost artifact but they played it as such to create suspense and joy from the reveal.Each episode focuses on a different movie. Dan does a great job as host. I love how they go to locations and meet those who are responsible for the movies we love - both behind the scenes and the actors/actresses. Speaking with 'prop masters', to use that term very loosely, was insightful. To see how they did what they did was fun. Sometimes they use simple objects (hockey helmet), to the old (a dictaphone), to times they had to imagineer something that didn't exist.It was an enjoyable journey into the props of movies. I watched all 8 and I hope they keep this series going.",False
6,10,Very interesting and fun show to watch,bebegirldc,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a great show! We love seeing what was done behind the scenes and the different props they use.

7,10,The genius of simple,ewlodarski,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether you are or aren't a movie buff, into cinematography, camera angles and effects, the simplicity of props and costumes are amazing and become what people remember. The small details that elevate the senses. In the age of computers, cgi and special effects, older movies relied on clever techniques and significant creativity to create a world for the viewer to escape to. For me, the other part that makes the movie a hit are the music scores and proper placement to have the audience feel the moment.In any case, Dan does a great job portraying what props did for movies which we all take for granted. The talent and creativity to design and create these simple elements is incredible.Definitely is a must watch and would love to see more.",False
8,10,Fantastic!,ludvigklemencic,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every single episode is fantastic, i just start to love the movies even more than before!",False
9,1,Host seems disingenuous,richardbrucejulien,n/a,16/08/2025,"I want to like this but... the host just needs to step back and let the guests talk about their contributions.
I picked up a few new facts from favourite movies but overall I expected better.
Not bad 5/10",False
10,1,Promising Until a Questionable Edit in Episode 4,somewhatMovieBuff,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really liked the first few episodes and it really is enjoyable seeing props from the hit films; however, I saw something questionable in the Pirates of the Caribbean episode.As the host was given a boat tour to see the rocks at St. Vincent, he was guided by a black captain who had a Caribbean accent (please forgive me if I don't know which specific one). The Caribbean man was speaking perfect English and the accent wasn't even that thick but he was given subtitles. The audio was perfectly fine too.Moving on the the next scene/guest, Mr. Francois, a white man who was an extra on the film had a stronger accent than the captain, yet was given no subtitles.Maybe I'm overreacting and reading into it too much but frankly, I was dismayed when I saw that contrast.I want to be proven wrong if I seem to be making assumptions.",False

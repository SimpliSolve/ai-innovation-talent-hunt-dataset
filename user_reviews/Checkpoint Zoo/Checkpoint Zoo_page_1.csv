1,10,Stunning and heart rending,samlintonwriter,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've never reviewed a movie before, but then again, this isn't a movie, but a documentary. All aspects are stunning. If you're an animal lover, your heart will be touched. If you care about humans who love animals, you'll especially appreciate the selflessness and sacrifices made by those who worked to save these animals.This is not much of a spoiler, but the name of the place isn't actually Checkpoint Zoo. Feldman Ecopark was in the middle of the early days of the unprovoked brutal full-scale war by russia against Ukraine. The name of the documentary will make sense when you watch it.Scattered humorous scenes and reflections after the fact contrast powerfully with the stark terror that the animals and their rescuers experienced. Those moments of relief are needed because the average viewer would probably be overwhelmed otherwise.I'm not sure if I'm an average viewer or not, but I'm crying as I write this a day after I saw it.Slava Ukraini

2,10,Absolute powerhouse film that everyone should see.,anthrogenesisdesign,n/a,15/08/2025,"A heart-shredding yet hopeful look at a handful of heroes who dare to rescue nearly 5000 animals from a zoo on the front lines. A magnificent and terrifying true story of heroism and bravery that proves that humans can be animals, while ordinary humans can accomplish extraordinary things.There is so much heartbreak and hope in equal measure. I can't remember being so moved by a documentary. It felt like I was watching the Schindler's List of zoo animals. I feel like I'll need several days to fully process what I've seen, and I know many moments in this film will follow me for life.Everyone in the world should see this incredible film.",False

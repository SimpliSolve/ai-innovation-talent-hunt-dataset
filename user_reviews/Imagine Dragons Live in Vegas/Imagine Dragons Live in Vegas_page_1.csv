1,9,Amazing movie!,zargsm,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a good way for people who wanted to go to this concert on September 10, 2022(sorry if you sadly couldn't go to this exact date). Very good at home concert!I actually went to this show and was actually even better in person.WARNINGS: there are flashing lights and a speech about life(for motivation)and one about unaliving and depression/anxiety (I think you can tell what I mean, using nicer words). Please watch with caution if these trigger you.Otherwise, besides emotional parts, this is an awesome show. I loved this as much as I saw this live and totally recommend.Also for any fans of Imagine Dragons or if you just like their music.",True
2,10,Impressive Energy!!!,Luv2Binge,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you are not already attracted to Imagine Dragons' musical style, please don't watch the movie and and give them a bad review and bash the band. That would be like going to a restaurant and ordering a dish of something that you would never dream of eating and complaining about it to the chef.I've never been so moved by a band in my 61 years of life. I'm overwhelmed, overjoyed at this outstanding performance and their love for their city of Las Vegas. My mother lived in Las Vegas for several years and I would visit her every other year for a month or more at a time. If you've had the privilege to experience an extended stay with a resident of the city, you can truly understand the love that Dan Reynolds expresses for the opportunity to grow up there. This movie just became my favorite movie of all time. Not only did they open with my favorite song of theirs, but they managed to partially work it in and close with the same song. Genius!!! This is, imo, the BEST band to hit the scene in the last decade+. The passion and compassion they emit seeps in to the very core of my soul. Keep on keepin' on guys. I'm excited for what's yet to come from you. Thank you so much for sharing your gifts with the world. âœŒ â™¥ ðŸŒŽ
Edit: 2 thumbs down ðŸ¤” that's just shameful!!! Haters gonna hate and that's their heavy burden to carry. Lighten up your load and keep your hate to yourself. Love is human instinct; hate is a learned behavior and best to keep your hate to your-self. Listen to their song, ""No Time For Toxic People."" Please DON'T let the haters stop you from watching this phenomenal live concert performance. I watch it at least a few times a month. They are extremely humble, great guys and I hope they stick around for many years to come.",False
3,10,ONLY CONCERT MOVIE I'VE EVER ENJOYED!,rogelynjingco,n/a,15/08/2025,"Honestly, I've been made fun of a few times for liking Imagine Dragons, apparently it's some sort of meme or trend just like what happened with Nickelback (which I am also a fan of), but it doesn't affect me.One of my favorite things about Imagine Dragons is their music is literally FOR EVERYONE. I love how there's no vulgarity in their music and lyrics. Just amazing, genuine, heartfelt music. They pour their hearts and souls into all their songs and it shows not only in the music itself but in their LIVE concerts as well. Their music live is just as great if not better live than in studio.They've been my favorite band for a few years now, and when I saw the LIVE in Vegas album was out, I listened to it immediately, and needless to say, I've cried so many times just listening to it. When I heard a movie of the concert was out, I got so excited and immediately went to watch it on Hulu.Their concerts are just so amazing! The energy, the aesthetic displays, the visuals, the sound, the showmanship from every single member. It's so mesmerizing! I cannot wait for the day I get to watch them live and experience such a marvelous event.Also, they just really show so much love to their fans, you can tell they're grateful for every one of us, I've cried listening to the album and watching the LIVE concert just from the little speeches Dan has given.I loved watching and listening to each and every single band member give their stories of the evolution of the band and their own experiences as individuals.I HIGHLY recommend watching this movie if you're a fan or if you don't know much about them but you like their music.",False

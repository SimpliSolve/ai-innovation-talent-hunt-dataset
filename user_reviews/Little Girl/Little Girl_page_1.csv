1,8,What it's like to live as a transgender...,ozwitt,n/a,16/08/2025,"An authentic documentary from beginning to end. Truly moving; not a dry eye in the audience (don't ask me how I know that). Educational, and mentality transforming. Recommended for all to see. If nothing else, it makes us appreciate the living complexities transgender people have to endure. Sasha was brave and adorable, and her mother a true champion.",False
2,10,Tears and Love,chriskuhndesign,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved every second of this documentary. This film is a gift and everyone who ever said something transphobic should look this child in the eyes and think about how much pain they are causing. I cried a lot but I also saw so much love in this family and I am happy that Sascha ha such an incredibly great family supporting her on her journey. Shame on the teachers, they should be open and helpful rather than ignorant. Thanks you SÃ‰BASTIEN LIFSHITZ for this docu, it really touched me.",False
3,10,Absolutely Incredible!,tomcxp,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was hands down the best documentary I've seen in all my life! It perfectly captured the strife of what transgender children and their families experience throughout a child's transition. The cinematography was stunning and I was fully engrossed throughout the entire film. I love the use of correct terminology and a heart-warming (and at times, heart-wrenching) portrait of living life to its fullest and the struggles that come with it.",False
4,10,"""Little Girl"" is a must see documentary:",djrt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Little Girl in my opinion is a must see. An astonishingly respectful, person centred documentary; following little 7 yrs old Sasha as she & her family negotiate living fully as the girl she is. I'm in awe at the family doing this kindness for the kids that follow. My late friend and LGBT volunteer Gladys was indeed 7 yrs old when she knew she too was a girl way back in 1943. She didn't have the support or care wee Sasha has had from the true professionals looking out for her, prioritising listening to her and ensuring their work is focussed on her happiness at this essential stage in her life. I guess that is part of why this splendid documentary had such an impact upon me. I watched on Curzon Home Cinema on Mark Kermode's recommendation - I hope they bring it back. So many parents could benefit from sight of it, especially so seeing wee Sasha's mum struggles with the questions we might not think obvious. Her dad and brother are just the best too! I hope ultimately, there is a Blu-ray/DVD release too.",False
5,10,Should be a must watch for everybody,guyoscarmorris,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautifully shot, very poignant tale which does more to elucidate the trans issue than any number of hours spent in the fist fight that is Twitter. It should be made compulsory viewing for all kids and adults.",False
6,10,A Film to Change Attitudes,barbaratruman-44559,n/a,16/08/2025,"This beautifully filmed documentary is an intimate portrait of an admirable family, so loving and supportive of Sasha, who was born male but longs to be accepted as a girl. I discovered Petite Fille only recently on BBC i-player and it was a complete revelation. Sasha's anguish moved me to tears, and her story completely changed my attitude towards children displaying gender dysphoria. She has much to face and I am so glad to know that her parents and siblings will be supporting her every step of the way. I hope very much that we might get to know something of her progress at some time in the future.",False

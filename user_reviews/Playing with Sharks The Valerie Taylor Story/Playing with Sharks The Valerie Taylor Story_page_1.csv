1,8,Taylor gives proof to the world that there is no need to fear some of our oceans most misunderstood creatures - sharks.,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Many of us are completely mesmerized by Earth's oceans and find the species inhabiting these bodies of water very fascinating. What lies beneath the ocean's surface is both exciting and frightening at the same time. Species ranging from small macro-molecules to gigantic creatures that lurk within these waters offer us fear of the unknown. Valerie Taylor, a famed underwater filmmaker and shark researcher, has made a life for herself stepping into that unknown. Valerie's life story as a pioneer of close-up encounters with the most frightening of all ocean creatures has been made into a riveting new documentary film, Playing with Sharks. Within this film Taylor gives proof to the world that there is no need to fear some of our oceans most misunderstood creatures - sharks.Playing with Sharks is a fascinating tribute to Australia's Valerie Taylor, who has spent more than 70 years diving into oceans around the world capturing footage of a variety of shark species, including that of the Great White. As part of National Geographic's 9th Annual Shark Fest, this documentary chronicles the life of a woman who has gone from champion spearfisher to shark protector. Valerie's early days as a marine hunter was halted following a personal revelation that depletion of massive numbers of marine animals will undoubtedly change the habitats she loves most. Realizing that there are only 10% of sharks left in the world, it was an easy decision for Taylor to retire her spear and shoot these apex predators using only her camera. In what seemed to be the highlight of Valerie's career when her shark footage was used in the making of Steven Spielberg's 1975 thriller, Jaws, but it actually brought unintended consequences for these marine creatures. The movie Jaws unexpectedly triggered a heightened fear and complete dislike for sharks. In a race to quickly fix the tarnished perception of sharks, Valerie Taylor became a powerful voice for their protection.Sally Aitkins, Emmy-nominated director and writer of Playing with Sharks, has moved mountains with this documentary! Through remastered footage of Valerie Taylor's life journey, Aitkins shines a bright light on this living legend. The flashbacks to Taylor's earlier professional years is a great touch to the film and allows viewers to experience just how passionate Valerie is about marine life and her determination to protect it. The many marine professionals who share their experiences with Valerie also add a great deal to this film. The footage shared in this documentary serves as the evidence needed to move us from fear to respect for these amazing creatures who call the ocean their home.Playing with Sharks has many messages, but the most important one is the need for mutual respect for all forms of life with which we share our world. We live in a world driven by greed and disrespect for other living things and, because of this, not everyone understands that we all depend on each other for survival. When removing one link to a chain, the chain falls apart. We must find a way to better understand nature in order to appreciate it. In her lifelong commitment to conservation, Valerie Taylor has done just that - she has exposed the truth about sharks and has created an audience of believers that these creatures have for years been misunderstood.I give Playing with Sharks 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18. Adults would especially enjoy this documentary. Playing With Sharks begins streaming on Disney+ July 23, 2021. This is a must see film for all marine lovers.By Dominic D., KIDS FIRST!",False
2,8,Great film,kellybethga,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBut I don't think she needed to feel guilty about Jaws; the real problem is shark fin soup, which makes a brief appearance in the film.",True
3,10,Gorgeous and thought-provoking film,jordanand94,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw the premiere of this film through Sundance online and wow, this film was magnificent. I had never heard of Valerie Taylor before but was intrigued by the synopsis I read online; long story short, Taylor's relationship with sharks started with spear fishing and she was very notable in her native Australia for it, but she and her husband put an end to their spear fishing days after they realized it was wrong. After Taylor's epiphany moment from killing one shark in particular, she and her husband instead became ambassadors to sharks and advocates for their conservation. They helped revolutionize and change society's interpretations of sharks as a whole and helped society sway away from the social construct that they are soulless, killing machines. Despite this though, as the documentary points out, we still have a long way to go to giving sharks the protection they truly deserve. Through gorgeous cinematography and great storytelling, the film achieves what it aims to.",False

5,10,An amazing woman's incredible lifelong journey into the world of Sharks.,SharkmanAB,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a very young teen in 1970, I saw Valerie Taylor, her late husband Ron and fellow Australian Rodney Fox for the first time, in the classic documentary ""Blue Water, White Death."" I was already hooked to the beauty of the underwater world, but it was here that these 3 inspired my love for Sharks and I followed in their footsteps with my lifelong fight to protect these magnificent creatures.In this epic documentary, Valerie takes us on an amazing journey into her own teen years as a spearfishing champion, her romance with the sea and also with Ron, who made her his underwater model. We see the couple embarking on an expedition that changed their lives forever and made them protectors and defenders of our oceans and the creatures that live in it. They travelled around the world filming sharks and educating the general public about the huge misconception that these awesome creatures are mindless killing machines in a time when sharks were labelled as Maneaters following the release of ""JAWS"".Their mission is not over yet as Valerie, now 85, and following Ron's death in 2012. Is still involved in conservation issues and still dives to spend time surrounded by and Playing With Sharks.",True

7,3,Too many people,briantheinternetboy,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerPlease for goodness sake if you are going to make a film that goes in the shark documentary category please do not show this amount of human. I want to see sharks. I have no interest in humans. I can see humans for free all the time. They roam wild in targets and Walmarts and taco places and driving cars and in my house with me and just jogging on the street. You know who i cant see just wondering around in my daily life? That's right. Sharks. There are enough humans I can see regularly. I want to see frkin sharks.I appreciate that the main character is cool and she plays with sharks but if i type shark into disney plus and it brings up a person as the main character then there has been a severe disconnect or dare i say failure somewhere.,True
8,10,Amazing Journey,mike_uk_1984,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ron and Valerie Taylor are an asset to this world and hopefully will breed new generations of conservationists for years to come.Sharks are amazing creatures, not monsters.",False
9,10,A Brilliant Treasure,admanrege,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTruly inspiring. A must watch. For the following reasons:
1) the idea of conservation of all that's precious on this Earth was pioneered by their efforts
2) sharks went from being killer eating machines to being understood and essential to the ecosystem
3) we now know how the footage for the blockbuster film Jaws was shot
4) the most aggressive and most responsible for human incidents award among sharks changes hands from the great white to a completely different shark in this filmSimply wonderful.",True
10,10,Wonderful Documentary,destiny_west,n/a,16/08/2025,"Growing up watching Ron and Valerie documentaries, I was excited to watch ""Playing with Sharks"" and being able to learn more about the life of Valerie Taylor.Both Ron and Valerie Taylor are/were such assets to Australian marine life, and world marine life, especially in relation to sharks.This documentary was mesmerizing. Valerie is such a strong woman and national treasure. I would love to see an actual film done about her life, with perhaps Margot Robbie playing her part.If you love sharks and the Taylors then definitely do not miss out on this documentary.I had just a few weeks before watching this documentary rewatched the classic Blue Water, White Death documentary, when Valerie and Ron had gone on search of Great Whites in South Africa in the 70's with other marine experts. How times have changed, it was quite destressing to relive seeing the slaughter of whales.Definitely take the time to watch Playing with Sharks, you will not be disappointed, and lets hope some Aussie film maker decides to make a biopic about Valerie and Ron.",False

1,5,"Very Boring, Poor Narration",TK32,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was looking forward to a nice nature documentary, however this turned out not to be it. The narrator's voice is flat and emotionless, a poor choice on the producer's part. Then there's the storyline, which is also not well put together. There is nothing captivating or attention-holding about it.I could leave it here and be done with it, but due to this six hundred characters requirement, reviewers ar forced to fluff out their reviews unnecessarily which only serves to make them worse.All in all, to recap. I would not recommend this as it looks unenthusiastically put together and no one seems very excited about that:",False

1,10,Incredible career of a man who my life's football soundtrack,colonel-13070,n/a,15/08/2025,"Because of my age I saw Madden as a coach and also his entire career as a broadcaster. He is every bit as fun and amazing in his presentation as he is shown here. Troy Aikman said it best, Madden is the soundtrack of our lives as it relates to football when I was enjoying the game then. Hes a lot of things to a lot of people but he definitely brightened up the game, made it more fun to watch, and you know if him and Summerall were on the game they were going to do a great job. They never disappointed. This documentary is amazing! Very well done to the point where I could watch 10 more hours of uncut footage. Giving this a 10 all day and hoping for more.",False
2,4,Lazy.,TheOneThatYouWanted,n/a,15/08/2025,"RIP John, RIP. Considering the man this documentary is about, it is lacking. This should have been a three part mini series or something. It just doesn't have enough time to really cover Madden. A lazy documentary. Totally would not make the All Madden team.",False

1,6,"Interesting And Compelling, But Unclear As To Its Fruitfulness",david-meldrum,n/a,15/08/2025,"An undeniably entertaining and alarming documentary detailing a war game about a repeat of the January 6th 2021 insurrection in Washington. What it reveals is, to a certain extent, both reassuring and alarming. There are clearly aspects of American - and this will be mirrored in governments across the world - civil leadership that are not as grounded in the real concerns and practices of people who could potentially pose a real threat. I wasn't fully convinced that some of the failures of leadership in the game were shown to have convincingly serious enough ramifications. And whilst a report on the exercise has been shared at the highest level of the American government, the film ends with a sort of misty-eyed patriotism which suggests to me that there's a real danger of this being another exercise in liberal elites talking to themselves.",False
2,7,"Great Concept, Bad Subject",grimmfilment,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I say bad subject, I mean focusing on a theoretical repeat of January 6th insurrection. Americans may need to be burned before they learn not to grab the pan... but when they do, best be sure they'll overcompensate with the mittens.That said, January 6th was a shocking moment that reverberated around the world and left me, a non US citizen, absolutely stunned. A lot of documentaries have been made about the day, what went wrong and why. Charges were brought up, courts did their thing and in the end... well, you know what happened.What this exercise attempts to do is recreate the same event but with a bit more spicing to the mix, and therein lies the problem. Everyone who has participated in this exercise has been in politics in one way, shape or form. These people have, without a doubt, studied the events of that day and by default went in this exercise, albeit somewhat in the dark, still aware of possible consequences to their decisions. They're essentially fighting a battle that has already been won... despite the monkey wrenches the game master throws at them.The documentary touches of militias, radicalized current and former members of armed forces, high ranking members of the armed forces taking political stances and the risk that comes with that, being able to order their troops to take a side in an event like the one on January 6th when a close election happened. It's all a bit too farfetched, but then again so was the attack on the Capitol... until it happened.My gripe is that this concept has the potential to be brilliant, if for no other reason than to inform the public, to give them insight on how decision making takes place behind closed doors. A while ago a TV show named the West Wing did just that, with the exception of adding drama to spice things up, but it gave the audience an inside look into politics... and itch I don't think any other program has satisfied since.War Game scenario has that potential. Picture a random group of politicians brought together having a random crisis thrown their way and watching them trying to navigate it. Picture two groups, unaware of each other, playing off each other by trying to achieve their respective goal. I mean, I know there would be some level of ""censorship"" of the process... but it would still be an incredible watch.Either way, I initially gave this a 5, but I did so having only watched until the half way point. The second half of the documentary sees things pick up the pace and become quite tense... for an exercise.It's a fascinating watch. And also, that was one hell of a presidential speech.",False
3,n/a,Interesting look at a worthwhile exercise,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are clearly people throwing 1s at this who haven't actually watched it. Even the longer written reviews with low ratings are not motivated by the quality of the documentary or the importance of the subject, but by partisan defensiveness.The presence of retired service members and serious former government officials who served under administrations of both parties adds weight to the simulation. The documentary, while not perfect, is generally well done and offers a good look at how it progressed.Obviously this is framed in relation to January 6, and how you feel about that is going to color your perspective on the doc. But if you take the subject seriously, don't let the bad faith review bombing and conspiracy theorists scare you away. Watch and judge for yourself.",False
4,3,Not Really a War Game,rckrlsbck,n/a,15/08/2025,"A rather bizarre attempt to play a war game by making it a political exercise, instead of an actual unscripted war game exercise.The fact that the producers are blatantly attempting to make this movie about Jan 6 is bewildering along with their effort to discredit the military, especially the general who thinks that the military should be purged. There is plenty propaganda to make viewers cringe because of it's shamelessness.Some people might enjoy the theme, but most people will find it boring, contrived, inorganic, and missed opportunity to have a real dialogue about what makes the US unique, a diversity of ideals working towards a single purpose.",False
5,9,Disregard the lower scores and decide for yourself,michelle-belan-356-872904,n/a,15/08/2025,"I almost didn't watch it because of one 4-star review but wanted to see for myself and I did my own research. I don't think we watched the same documentary. I thought it was compelling to watch. It wasn't a scripted film, but the filming of an actual exercise with a lot more bells and whistles than such an exercise would have had in real life. What's telling about this is that the insurrectionist team can lie with impunity and create all kinds of chaos and the government team has to abide by the rule of law and stick to the truth - just like one hopes the government would do in real life. So it isn't as gripping as it would be if Aaron Sorkin wrote the dialogue because these folks were behaving as best they could given the circumstances, trying to win a war game that - thank goodness - wasn't for real.I have a lot of faith in our military, but it IS important to know that 1 in 5 insurrectionists were military, and many of our service men and women have been ill-treated, and could fall under the sway of someone like Michael Flynn. After watching The Brainwashing of My Dad, it's clear many people (military or not) are indoctrinated with false information and think they are being patriots but are just being manipulated, and the scenario portrayed in this movie is not that far-fetched. Mr. Goldsmith speaks to his own disillusionment eloquently and I don't think his concerns are overblown (and he actually testified before Congress so I think another reviewer protests too much).Is this scenario scary? Sure. Is it possible? Yes. Being an American comes with rights and responsibilities. We must understand how government works, and what our responsibility is to uphold the Constitution. To be educated and informed, to fact-check stories and not rely on only one news source. To vote and to help ensure the safe secure transfer of power. It's an important, thought-provoking movie.",False
6,3,January 6th The Progressive Boogeyman,The_Real_Review,n/a,15/08/2025,"Documentaries like this only reinforce that progressives have created a boogeymen in their mind about the January 6th protesters. January 6th was a political protest that turned into a riot by a complete lack of security at the Capital. A real ""insurrection"" would have included armed combatants and the result would have been a bloodbath. The fact that this never happened (thank God) should tell everyone what they really need to know about ""Documentaries"" like this.The bias of the producers and their identity politics devalues whatever aims this documentary was trying to achieve. In many cases I found the responses proposed by the former Democratic party office holders acting in this to be more disturbing than what they were trying to warn against. In multiple cases they attempted to justify the censorship of free speech, the invasion of privacy of U. S. citizens with illegal wire tapping and the declaration of Martial law.I don't have much more to add that was not already mentioned in the 4 star review, ""This Meeting Could Have Been an Email: ""War Game"" Is a Stuffy, Boring, and Self-Righteous Attempt at Establishment Agitprop"" only that for the love of God someone tell Heidi Heitkamp she is not the POTUS.",False
7,1,MUST SEE PREDICTIVE PROGRAMMING BY DEEP STATE OPERATIVES,rafename,n/a,15/08/2025,"Prepare yourself for the October surprise and crack down by the police state. In their own words. Top war mongers work to fake a reason to jail protesters and blame victims of the state.To be ready for the next FBI false flag ""January 6th"" operation see the plotters fantasy of infiltrating religious and political groups to set them up. Also see the Johns Hopkins Center & Bill Gates video ""Event 201"" a pandemic tabletop exercise that simulated the plandemic a month before the release of the Sars Cov 2 enhanced bat bioweapon in Wuhan. The1968 British documentary WAR GAME by the same name about a Vietnamese nuclear war with England! Also watch any training film on military & police crushing free speech and anti-war protests.",False
8,n/a,This documentary has it none!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIts sooo bad.Whatever you expected prepare for even more disappointment.Most of what you watch is anything but intellectual or art. To even associate it with the very word thought is an insult to the act.The vast bulk of your time will be sadly spent watching what seems to be a collection of nobodies and actual somebodies who are still at the rank of nobodies do their worst impression of ""acting"".I presume that the goal is some sort of bad video tube pod cast show where people toss together some kind of hideous L. A. R. P. practically off the cuff or with some loose outline or notes.Despite the pretense at times of some actual effort or basis for the premise presented there is so little actual substance for the hypothetical war game. The cast about broadly with random pictures and the vaguest of constructed scenarios without any consideration of actual details or context.Of course you get plenty of reality tv quality jerry springer drama manufactured in hyper small scenario details of the feared human cost in individual or small example very small scale terms. About the only places timely and appropriate if still amateurish music backing comes into play to kick off your emotional anxiety response by the instrumentals.The rest at best has vague unnoticed tones as if lulling you into some trance state of easy absorption and little higher thought.Perhaps documentaries are like science themselves and should never be questioned. Is that the new thought process for the very science of unbiased nonpartisan so on and so forth documentaries incidentally pouring out in explosive proliferation just before election time?This feels like all the quality of a handful of high school students project papers on tiny writing aspects of a fictional second insurrection or coup by a very partisan democrat party. Recognize how you spend close to half the films run time having the buzzword ""insurrection"" thrown at you as if by some automatic linguistic programming weapon. At times in relation to the ""insurrection act"" and in general usage to keep ones preprogrammed language associations and emotional conditioned responses firing for this bland flavorless propaganda so poorly constructed it should have MRE stamped on the side and seem questionably beyond its recommended ingestion date.",True
9,10,Thoughtful and sobering look into what might have happened,leslie-01768,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary filmed the tabletop red/blue exercise about what might have happened if Jan 6 rioters had enlisted higher ups in the military--and the national guard sent to protect the Capital had turned on the police and sided with the rioters.The people involved are all solid government and ex-gov officials with excellent reputations and solid experience. The production crew are all ex-military with good reasons to be concerned about the infiltration of extremists in the military.There are a lot of bad-faith review writers commenting. Ignore them and watch for yourself. It plays out in a realistic manner and the ending is thought provoking.With the potential for another ""Jan 6"" looming next year we all need to think about what might happen and be prepared to be on the side of our government and the non-violent transfer of power.",False
10,8,Exciting and thought-provoking documentary.,goodellaa,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA documentary about the question of ""what if?"" A bunch of people with knowledge and expertise go into a room and simulate a bad day for representative government. The game is under the control of what we used to call ""dungeonmasters"", who also have knowedge and expertise regarding gaming and insurrection. Getting to know the various participants is part of the audience's education. Simulated information (and dis-information) comes in and the players try to deal with it. Basically the sitting President of the United States and his cabinet and advisors. The Congress is attempting to certify the ballots cast by the Electoral College and the situation is getting bad and escalating. Before this is over 10% of State Governors will be asking the simulated President to Federalize the Guard using the Insurrection Act. This exciting game goes fast and gets into areas of law and history most people seldom think about but probably should. Both sides are (they say) attempting to stop a coup, so we win no matter what. Right? Play again and you may get a drastically different outcome. Not telling. The documentarians have followed the basic law of cinema and made it all entertaining. Good luck.",True

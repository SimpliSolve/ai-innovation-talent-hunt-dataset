1,9,Fascinating look at early palaeontologists,markham-99799,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having spent many happy hours on Charmouth beach hunting ammonites and belemnites, this documentary was ideal for expanding my interest, and finding out how these 'curiosities' and their study was spearheaded by a young local girl, Mary Anning. Her story was both fascinating and poignant, and I for one was glad to see that she now has scientific recognition for her work, as well as a recently-installed statue commemorating her efforts.The gradual growth of the study of these fossilised relics, and how they came to be accepted in mainstream science is covered well by Felicity and Greg, in a natural and heart-warming style. Their enthusiasm is evident throughout the documentary.I learnt a surprising amount, helped by the presenters' relaxed delivery, and I can recommend this to anyone with a passing interest in the subject.",False
2,9,Insightful angle into the world of dinosaurs,Tostig66,n/a,16/08/2025,"As children, we all know about dinosaurs. We even end up having a favourite one. However, 500 years ago, the word ""dinosaur"" didn't exist and any kind of fossil evidence was attributed to things as diverse as dragons or petrified snakes. But, about 200 years ago, scientist, started to come up with the idea that there was an ancient era where giant lizards roamed the world.That's what this fascinating documentary is about. It's not a complete history of the Jurassic or Cretaceous, but instead, it's the story of the slow realisation that scientific rigour was needed when discovering these ancient fossilised remains.",False
3,9,An enjoyable watch for any dinosaur or palaeontology enthusiast,charbir,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seeking the First Dinosaur Hunters is a charming look at the colourful history of palaeontology's origins and the social stories that led to the discovery of the enigmatic dinosaurs.Visiting some of Europe's most renowned natural history museums, Greg and Felicity show a real passion for the subject and their enjoyment when making the documentary is clear to see too.This is a lovely introduction into the work and lives of the 'scientists' behind some of the first dinosaur discoveries and there are sneak peeks at some of their fossil finds too. An enjoyable watch for any dinosaur or palaeontology enthusiast.",False
4,10,The beginning of Dinosaurs,lindsey-77433,n/a,16/08/2025,Greg and Felicity trace the earliest paleontologists to show the viewer how the world of dinosaurs we know today first evolved in the scientific community. This is the third documentary I've watched from these two and enjoy their storytelling and well-researched topics. I always come away smarter and wanting to know more!I'd recommend this documentary to anyone who has an interest in dinosaurs or realizes they have always taken for granted the study of these fossilized creatures.The videography was solid with interesting locations as evolving backdrops to the story that takes Greg and Felicity from England to Belgium.,False
5,10,Charming and engaging.,apifera,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greg and Felicity are so charming and appear genuinely in love with the subject matter. They present the story line in a concise and well thought out manner. There is a gentle respect for the humanity of the first dinosaur hunters and their awe at being allowed in with the first bones Mary et al discovered and documented is palpable and inspiring.The documentary flows well. And I honestly can't find fault with the production values, because this is a debut for the pair and for that- it's very strong.With their cheeky humor and attention to detail they'll definitely be one to watch. I'm excited to see what's next.",False
6,10,Loved it,greenfingersandtoes,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been fascinated with Dinosaurs all my life and enjoyed this film immensely. It was presented well and engaged me from the off with the subject matter and the knowledge and enthusiasm.Thoroughly recommend to any budding fossil enthusiasts for some background insights into how research has changed into this fascinating subject.I have had the pleasure of going on one of the tours on the Isle of Wight and was captivated by the knowledge and storytelling. The film has created a similar experience by transporting me back to the beach in another time. Camera shots were brilliant and certainly generated atmosphere, loved it.",False
7,10,Get it watched!!!,deanpallisterdp,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA great watch, really likable host, you can see their love for the subject. Brought a lot of memories back of me as a child reading my Dinosaur books, I was especially interested in the early pioneers of Paleontology. The image of the Megalosaurus jaw bone especially hit the nostalgia button, remember this image in my books and the lucky hosts get to handle the actual jaw. Any documentary that feature the crystal park dinosaurs gets my attention, still on my bucket list of places to visit and the host I believe had a hand in preserving these works of art. Keep watching the credits too, couple of funny bloopers too.",True
8,9,A fascinating insight into the origins of Dinosaur study.,Travelenthusiast,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was not a subject that I had any particular interest in before seeing this, but having seen some of the other films from these filmmakers I decided to watch.It is a lovely introduction for someone new to the subject, but still provides a lot of information. Unlike most dinosaur based documentaries, this one focuses less on the creatures themselves and more on how people began to study them, and some of the mistakes made by people who first found the bones.This is presented with the couple's usual friendly presentation, which shows a real enthusiasm for the subject, and which is infectious to the viewer.",False

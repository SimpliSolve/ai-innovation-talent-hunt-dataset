1,6,"Starts fun, has a weird WATA ad in the middle, ends pretty good",darkschuey,n/a,16/08/2025,"Look, I have no issues with collectors. I have a (modest) video game collection myself.I do think the time spent on sealed games and the hype on their importance was a bit of a waste.BTW, I am far from jealous of sealed games. I've owned them and simply opened them because I think these things are meant to be played (but this is just my opinion).The assumption (and insistence) that anyone that has issues with WATA (and their practices) and the overhype on sealed games is simply ""being jealous"" was certainly overplayed in the doco. I think they could have balanced the opinions by addressing the fact that this hobby was available to all, but due to people buying up huge swathes of copies, it has pretty much cut people from the hobby. Once again, not my jealousy as I'm good with what I have, but I know many others that are now locked out. It's just a shame is all. Most hobbies end up as rich people time wasters, so I guess it was inevitable.There are some interesting things here (rare consoles and one-offs) and some good personalities, just skip the ad in the middle and it's far more enjoyable.",False
2,2,A glorified youtube boast video,jellopuke,n/a,16/08/2025,"Look, this ""movie"" was just put together with self-filmed clips by youtubers and liberal stock footage inserts so technically it's awful, but what makes it a real slog is the need to aggrandize WATA games and that whole scam. They literally just wave off valid criticism of WATA by saying it's all jealousy which is really something else. Then you have the fact that the key faces in this movie are simply showing off their stuff and talking about how valuable it is and how they turn down offers, etc. The actual ""real"" people like Metal Jesus, Riggs, Hancock, etc are barely in it while the hoarder scammers of the WATA crowd get to wave their proverbial dicks in your face with their rare stuff. Get a life! And no how many times someone says that preserving a sealed game etc is preserving history, pop-culture, or art, doesn't make it true. These things were commodities. You are celebrating plastic and cardboard. The game exists outside of those things. A part of me wishes disc rot on all their rare games, but being somewhat of a collector myself (albeit with way stronger boundaries than these people) I will admit it's neat to see what they have, but the smugness of them really gets me.",False
3,n/a,"Like stepping into a retro game store, but with a high class air",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary will make u feel like you went back in time to the 80s to 90s, or u took a trip to a retro arcade.Seeing video games as a collector's game is on a whole different level.",False
4,10,For collectors of 80s nostalgia and video games,MartinPierron,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing documentary for children of the 80s/90s and those interested or are currently collector's of 80s-early 90s nostalgia especially video games, and video game systems. It's well put together and briefly explains the various systems discussed for even the casual collector or for those interested in learning more about the collecting fandom. Looking forward to the possible part 2, or physical release with deleted/cut interviews which as I understand is happening!",False
5,1,"Egotistical, self appreciation piece",bmors-29022,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't even know where to start, advertised throughout social media as by gamers for gamers, nothing could be further from the truth. A bunch of rich collectors showing off their sealed and graded WATA games which will never be played by gamers. We all know how bad WATA is now, the price inflation comes from wealthy people just buying games as a show of wealth to show off to similar people, and to top it off these collectors just paid $50,000 to make a movie about THEMSELVES! If you're an actual gamer, fan of old franchises, characters and passion for the playing of games this is an easy pass, stay away. If you want to see some rich guy looking for admiration because he has a few hundred thousand dollars of sealed games, this is your movie.",False
6,10,Epic & inspiring,jqm-06915,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is a love letter to video game collectors, no matter how they collect. It not only pays homage to the O. G. Collectors, but all those that came after, or are starting out. Anyone with nostalgia for Video Games will find enjoyment in this. The director featured Video Game enthusiasts from all aspects of Video Games, from the very first consoles all the way through the original Nintendo, Sega, Sony PlayStation & Microsoft Xbox eras.It shines a light on different types of Video Game collecting, whether they collect loose cartridges, artwork, Complete in box Video games and even the burgeoning scene of Original Factory-sealed, graded game Collectors and the exciting market that has followed.The theatre was buzzing, even those like my wife & daughter that have little involvement with video game collecting, found the film very informative & entertaining.The production is top-notch & the sets are all shot in the locations of these avid collectors, with intruiging backstories of their own.",False
7,1,Its a dissapointing WATA advertisement,thomasbager,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was really looking forward to watching this documentary, but it is unfortunately just a dissapointing WATA advertisementWhy would do this...?It just seems the whole movie was made, with only one goal in mind, just to get Wata to foot the bill to make this movie, it seems like that was the entire premise for this movie.I can not see how this movie does anything good for the retro video game collecting community as a whole. Furthermore it does not add anything new, as opposed to other gaming and retro collecting documentaries.It is clear that Wata has paid for this movie, and it purely to try to better their brandIt is very dissapointing!",False
8,3,No new ground,LizardKing97051,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's flashy and well edited but it's essentially a rip off of all those retro VHS collecting films that are getting dumped on Tubi, each of them is basically the same film over and over. The filmmaker interviews wealthy and often annoying YouTube personalities who collect video games. An entire segment is devoted to video game grading and winds up being a big commercial for the company WataGames, another segment features a couple of the more bigoted personality's making fun of Christians and Christian video games. It's well put together and at times interesting but overall, it's sadly nothing new.",False
9,10,Great documentary!,AshleyUnder,n/a,16/08/2025,I loved this doc. All the video games I grew up with were in here. I also learned a lot about the grading world and how to navigate buying and selling games. This was definitely an eye opener and I loved every minute of it!,False
10,2,Nothing Nostalgic About Film,fhknowhow,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film is primarily based on collecting NES games and doesn't get into the nostalgia of the original era of gaming. It feels like a 2021 film based on 2021 gaming.The people used in the film don't tell the story of gaming in the 80s and 90s and just don't have a sense of what it was like to game during this time. It's like they decided to collect something and chose NES cartridges, which produces a very boring film.",False
11,9,Very nostalgic,kevin-45609,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this documentary about the video game industry. As a child who grew up in the 80s/90s spending all my free time playing Nintendo and later sega- this was a really fun walk down memory lane. I really sympathized with all of the collectors and liked the different viewpoints and styles of collecting. Made me want to go home and hookup my N64, which is the oldest system i still own lol.",False
12,10,Worth Watching for Gamers and Non-Gamers Alike,NeverBrokenDMB,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fabulous documentary that is a must-watch for video game fans and children of the 80s, but also for anyone who has ever had a passion for something from childhood and tried to recreate it in some way. The film examines what ""nostalgia"" really is as well as the hobbies and activities that bind people together through the lens of a fascinating industry with lots of insider access. Highly recommended.",False
13,10,Back when life was carefree...,paul-louis-harrell,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film puts us on a quest we all remember, with a quaint familiarity... meeting new members on that same quest who join the party! We see the hearts of the people, and the games they loved then and love now. Even shows a dark side of collecting...It's an emotional journey if you once played NES games that were rented on Friday Night alongside a VHS Movie, and played with greasy pizza hands accompanied with a Mountain Dew to wash it down.",False
14,10,For gamers and non gamers,beribrite-37025,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a great documentary for collectors and gamers! It's also an awesome trip down memory lane. Very funny and entertaining! Love the details in the stories they tell from their past experiences. Highly recommended.,False
15,10,Super Fun and Interesting,aak-27039,n/a,16/08/2025,Great documentary with a lot of insightful info. Kind of rekindled my love for retro collecting and is inspiring me to better organize and display my own collection. Great work here!,False
16,9,"Funny, Educational and GAMES!!!",ath0629,n/a,16/08/2025,"I never knew about the people who collects old / older video games. This movie documents behind the popular video games and go deeper on people collecting games. It's funny, educational and also eye opening. Highly recommended it.",False
17,10,"Entertaining, informative, and fun!",christinamarieleonard,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved watching this doc because as someone who has been introduced to the video game culture via friend groups, I didn't actually know much about gaming, collecting, etc, but always found it interesting. This documentary was great because I learned so much and so many different people from different parts of the world and walks of life were featured, all giving their own spin on the video game industry. It was a very entertaining piece that kept met wanting more!",False
18,10,RARITY IS A REFRESHING JOUNEY INTO NOSTALGIA,charleschudabala,n/a,16/08/2025,"RARITY is a refreshing journey into nostalgia.I felt the emotional pull of seeing games in their original condition- not seen since I was just a kid.

21,10,"80s kid, 90s teen who loved this!",smbrost,n/a,16/08/2025,There are some great interviews with memorable sound bites on why nostalgia plays such an important role in our lives. Well this is about my generation and the games I grew up on so of course I was enthralled with the collections and stories. Any 80s or 90s kid must watch and any gamer too!,False
22,8,Review for Rarity,Reviews_of_the_Dead,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a documentary that I decided to check out late in my workday. I treat these like podcasts where I'll listen and look down when something interesting is said. What I normally do is watch ones that are films, in the horror genre or obscure cinema related. I decided to check this one out as I used to be a gamer. I didn't necessarily play Call of Duty, Minecraft or those types of games. My first system was a Sega Genesis before shifting to Nintendo and then to PlayStation. I was a big fan of JRPG when I shifted over to Sony.Now what we're getting here is meeting a good handful of collectors. What I like here is that we're seeing the guys at the top and others who are more like someone you might work with. There was a good cross section of people. I did like that we got to know them, what got them into collecting and then where do they see their future heading with what they do. Something that is also interesting here is that there is a question posed about if they think what they're doing is obsessed or by having channels to display what they have, is that showing off? I do like that one of them gives the best answer that is somewhere in the middle for sure.Another aspect I enjoyed here is that we get the history of video game collecting. This also ventures a bit into the history of this industry itself. I enjoyed seeing these people's collections, but hearing more of what they know about what they have or the lore they've heard, that interested me more. There is one who is from Europe who has a complete collection of systems for Nintendo's GameCube. That blew my mind.Then to shift over to filmmaking. I thought this was well-made. They did a good job of mixing in footage from games with the interviews that we're seeing. How they display the collections and having the interviewees showing the prized possessions was a good touch. The biggest thing that brought a smile to my face was using music that was inspired by the older games. That was a good touch for sure. This does tease at the end that there will be a part two. That is something I'd check out if it is made. I'd recommend it to collectors, especially of video games, or if you're an old school gamer for nostalgia.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",False

1,10,Breathtakingly Beautiful,mabelpereira-74784,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Apocalypse of Saint John is a 98-minute documentary set about sixty-four years after our Lord's Ascension. It was directed by Sim√≥n Delacre and Patricio Dondo and produced by Caravel Films.After being persecuted because of his faith, St. John was sentenced to banishment in the island of Patmos by order of the cold-blooded emperor Domitian. Once in the Greek island, the old apostle started writing what would be known as the last book of the Bible, which was shrouded in mystery at that time.From the very beginning this audiovisual masterpiece will clarify whatever doubts you may have regarding the hidden true message of the Holy Bible's most enigmatic book, the Apocalypse. What is more, this documentary is filled with clear explanations about the Book of Revelations and also outstanding effects that combines a fine balance between a.i. Visual effects, computer-generated imagery and practical effects.If you are not sure about what movie is worthy of both your time and money, then you should definitely give Caravel Films' ""El Apocalipsis de San Juan"" a try. This documentary will not let you down!",False
2,1,"A two-hour fundamentalist rant, with no movie-like qualities",philip1983,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is likely that anyone watching this movie would find the positive reviews here to be unrealistic. Everyone in the theater with us, including our party of six, left in disgust. We were expecting a faith-based film with research and explanations, engaging for families.Instead, we found a two-hour endless narration of a jumble of two thousand years of history and a warped, repetitive point of view that shows both a lack of knowledge and ability to stick to the subject of the book of Revelation. We found that it seriously offended our Catholic faith, was in total discord with the caring communities fostered here in Mexico, to the point that we now wish we were not so polite as to avoid walking out.This pseudo-documentary doesn't get better, it just repeats and repeats. There are no scenes, just scattered silent people among hideous cartoons and seconds of 'news' mixed with condemnations. There are no facts, no research, just two-thousand years of history twisted and turned to the point where nothing makes sense.Some examples of this rant of demonizations: any post-Trent Council, church-brokered peace in Mexico, the Vatican, Protestants, philosophers, etc., etc., etc. Are simply condemnedWe plan to ask for a full refund, and can easily understand why Cinepolis, after seeing the movie, at first declined it for screening.There are excellent faith-based movies that we have loved - Concepcion last month, Guadalupe, Mirando al Cielo, Cabrini, Fatima, etc. - we see all of them that come to our screens. With this one we have learned to research our choices better. We continue to feel cheated, and duped, with our kindness taken advantage of by people that attack it. I hope this review helps others to choose more wisely.To conclude, I have never seen as many enthusiastic church-goers at a faith-based movie falling asleep and on cell phones in any other theater.",False

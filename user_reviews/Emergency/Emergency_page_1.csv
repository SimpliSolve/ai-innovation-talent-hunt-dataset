1,1,Don't bother,beegee-40782,n/a,16/08/2025,"Boring show that just delays the footy telecast. I'm sure the doctors do good work but seriously this is just tedious.Several intercut stories feature in each episode with some typically saccharine, boring commentary from doctors who perhaps could have used a presentation class during med school.Couldn't believe it was back for a second season. Hopefully they learn their lesson and don't commission a third.",False

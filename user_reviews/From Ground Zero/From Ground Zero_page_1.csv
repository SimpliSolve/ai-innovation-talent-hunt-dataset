1,8,"""The sea, our only horizon, without it I'm not sure what would become of us.""",Blue-Grotto,n/a,15/08/2025,"Children with names written on their arms or legs to identify them in injury or death, digging in rubble for loved ones while calling out their names, sleeping on concrete, packed bags ready for the escape, buzzing sound of military drones overhead like ceaseless industrial drills, burning door frames for cooking, rushing in and out and back again, flashbacks to when your love is alive, lines for the toilet, water, and food in the camp, bodies in bags, and the future slipping through your hands.22 short films bearing witness to the mass killing, starvation, sickness, trauma, sorrow, suffering, and bombing of the people of Gaza, but also testimonies to the struggle to survive and doing so with dignity and hope. The films are in various styles including documentary, hybrid, drama, animation, essay, and experimental art therapy.""I believe in cinema and that it can bring about change,"" said Rashid Masharawi, one of the primary drivers behind the film. He was present at this North American premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival. ""We tell our own stories here, from the inside, how people are dealing with daily life, and with real emotion."" There was a three-minute pause in the middle of the film and an active listener available to help us process the raw, heart wrenching images and testimony. ""We are all on the same boat,"" said Masharawi ""trying to do our best.""Sunlight on the sea, beckoning dreams, dancing, kites in the sky, encouraging stories, little joys like tea, music, drawing, singing of love and hope, laughter, awakenings, and wishes for happy and beautiful lives.",False

3,10,Most emotional moments of cinema,tobiash-31811,n/a,15/08/2025,"These short films go under your skin and really touch your heart. I have left the cinema speechless and overwhelmed. It creates a deep connection to the people who live in a complete different world. They have to endure the hardest fate, that I could have never been able to imagine. But they will never give up. They are teaching us loving, hoping, caring, griefing, appreciating, cheering, sharing, living, and invite us reminiscing the good old days. That is everything they can do for us.For the sake of humanity we need to tell their stories around the world. That is the least we can do for them.",False

5,10,Art during death,osamahamdan,n/a,15/08/2025,"This set of short films highlight the fact that not only that art is necessary, but required even during a live stream destruction on life.It shows that Gaza has a culture of art and filmmaking that continues and adapts with the on going wars they have had to endure.The fact that as a world we have allowed this continue is not addressed but watching this begs to ask what is wrong with us? Why do we allow this to continue?Every single short film builds on the beauty of the people, shows they skills they continue to cultivate and surfaces the resilience of the Palestinian people in a way that no other film could do.",False
6,10,"Do people have a ""Choice""?",kgowhari,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really admire the artful assembly of the 22 short movies to narrate the stories of people in Gaza. Each story is a unique window to the soul of a human being and his/her daily struggle and allows audiences to connect with the characters despite the surreal environment they are living in. This assembly has been done with the full awareness to not overwhelm the audience to the scale that they feel completely helpless.A question came up with the friends, after we all watched the documentary. Question of ""having choice"". We asked how much choices do people of Gaza have? We debated and agreed and disagreed. I understand having ""choice"" for Palestinians is a very politically charged debate. I think this documentary really portrays people struggle with this question. And that's why I think everyone should watch it.",False

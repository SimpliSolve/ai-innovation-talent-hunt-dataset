1,9,Pro Modern Zoo documentary,gregg-king,n/a,15/08/2025,"An unabashedly pro modern zoo documentary well presented with supporting facts focused on actual results rather than preachy whiny PETA propaganda. Covers efforts to restore and maintain species around the world through reforestation, conservation and breeding programs as well as why efforts like Free Willy are doomed to failure. If you are looking for an unbiased viewpoint of zoos as a whole this isn't it, as no mention is made of the Tiger King and similar bad actors but this has been overly covered elsewhere. Having Helen Mirren's soothing voice as narrator was a big plus, no whiny preachiness needed here.",False

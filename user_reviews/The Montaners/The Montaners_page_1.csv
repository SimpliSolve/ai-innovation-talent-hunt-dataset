1,1,"Not good, not influential.",daniel-conder19,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wrongly depicted as ""Latin America's most influential family"" these series are not even worth watching.Poor character development, poor acting and boring interviews make up to a regletable watching episode series full of cringe and cheese acting surrounding a history of a family no one really cares for.Don't fall for the depiction of the show, save some time and just do a Google search instead.I could see this becoming a 2hr movie and not be watched by a soul, I truly wonder how this project came to life, in latin America and the rest of the world we agree, that the montaners are the most cringy worthy show out there.",False
2,2,Out of touch and quite cringe,scloud-66872,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first chapter shows an unrealistic view of the montaners, the show belongs to a different era of the early 2010s when the family was still somewhat a mistery. It has really poor acting, the settings and interviews only make it worse, with many contradicting views of the world, this show isn't really worth a second look, much less it being a show (Mr Montaner should have written a book or have done an interview instead).Not sure why the plot surrounding the ""family"" is being pushed as research shows the ""juniors"" have been attempting to make a crack to the music industry for more than a decade with little to show for, I have to note the great charisma of Mr. Montaner, despite not being able to act, the quality and caliber of his power of conviction and abilities to navigate and manage his family is undeniable, unfortunately the rest of the cast cannot say the same about his personal charisma with the exception of some moments of those added to the family.There has been a lot of speculation regarding the family and its ""cult-like"" nature, after seeing this show, one can't deny there must be a grain of truth within the statement.",False
3,2,"Badly produced, acting is abysmal",arandanvela,n/a,15/08/2025,"The montaners attempt to present themselves as a straightforward recounting of events that have occurred, the bad production of the series gives the impression that they are being deceptive by misleading editing it seams that ricardo and marlene are constantly coaching eva mau and ricky on what to say and how to behave.The plot is weird and a general feeling of re-staging scenes for the cameras gives the show a tough feeling to swallow. I think this show is not for anyone other than their existing 'hardcore' fans, it was odd and uneasy, specially when paired with the family's incestuous attitude on social media.Stay off, don't let your young girls watch this show, it is not real.",False
4,1,Unironically and unapologetically bad,i-01057-64720,n/a,15/08/2025,"From beginning to the end, it is plagued with bad acting, The Montaners seem too dishonest, every episode has a sub plot that makes it obvious the ture nature is self advertisement, without any real substance. Going back to the acting, I've looked up these people, having followed Ricardo for quite a long time, after seeing many alegations regarding his family on social media it was intrigued and decided to look the first 5 episodes... It is not worth it, It would seem that they agreed on a script (hopefuly because if they act in such a way in their day-to-day then they need help). The show seems like uncondimented rice, fake laughs and quite honestly fake 10 Stars reviews around here.Going back to the details, It is cringy how Mr Ricardo interacts with the in-laws, it seems as if he was ""adopting"" and assimilating the in laws to extend the relatable narrative, although they are the definition of failed nepo babies, their individual career doesn't seem to hold a candle to their sponsor Ricardo. I wished to see the old Ricardo, the one that wrote so many big hits, that seemed to be genuine. Instead we got a preacher with an over-pushed Venezuelan accent, it seems like each passing year he becomes more ""maracaucho"" even though he hasn't been there in a decade or lived in Venezuela in about 2-3 decades.To end the review the sons (and daughter) show little range of emotions, they seem to be managed completely by their parents, never fully showing who they are, if they are something at all.I did wanted to see Alejandro Montaner as I remember watching his career live and thinking, this is the man that will take the torch and go to the next level as a father-son musicians. Unfortunately it seems that this is ""Some of The Montaners "" and not The Montaners (unless the other guy is excommunicated).",False
5,10,Don't believe the haters,asclafani-02912,n/a,15/08/2025,"I question whether many of the negative reviewers went into this already disliking the family & wanting to find content to criticize. I have always been a huge fan of Camilo, Mau y Ricky, Evaluna's music, & followed the family for some time. I was worried going into it that it would be cringey, but it ended up being very heartwarming to see that the values they individually often speak about, family, love, faith, etc. Are all shown in this series - I think maybe some people are just very uncomfortable with the idea that an objectively successful family can truly also be of good character. Yes it is a show so who ever really knows what people are like, but it certainly shed a consistent & positive light on them all. And in terms of acting... I think it's fair to say they carried themselves for what it was, a reality show about their lives & family. The people who are being so critical about this might not be viewing it from this perspective.",False
6,2,Not entertaining at all!,n-68033-11060,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a let down, there is absolutely nothing good here, the cast looks like over-rehearsed group of badly casted actors. The ridiculisness of the family being so out of touch and in full honesty not nearly as influential as they think they are.We watched bits and pieces of each episode, usually finding ourselves muting them every now and then due to the shallow conversations, please disney cancel this and invest your money on other series, this reality is dead in the water.Also, special shout to how weird Ricardo has gotten with his in-laws, it seems as if he loves camillo more than his older sons because he is more famous than himself nowadays, great investment on his part.Mau and sara sound so fake I can't believe they are not some part of an arrangeged marriage (same for the other 2).Too bad, better if left to the imagination as a book or an article!!!!",False
7,9,Easy to watch and fun,sofires,n/a,15/08/2025,"This shows the Montaner family as they are: kind and fun. It's real, fresh and also light, it doesn't show drama or excess of intimacie. A show to watch as a family and understand the love and values this family has.If you don't like them or their music just don't watch it, is 100% them so don't expect hate, drama or something that is not them.And who ever is watching this trying to find the hate or gossips that some tabloids spread don't lose your time, you will not find that.I hope there's a second season soon and it shows more about the new babies of the family. Imposible not to love them after watching.",False
8,1,Not good at all!,imd-46134,n/a,15/08/2025,"My goodness, It is so out of touch, I don't get who is investing money in this family, they are only liked in argentina and not even that much now! This should not have been a reality tv show, where is the drama? Where is the real information?The montaners are beyond fake and boring, they use religion as shield for doing whatever money laundry operation they do, fake cristians if I ever saw ones. I don't know if Montaner still sells any records but they are far from being influential, and to talk about Ricky and Mau... I remember that they used to sing a different genre, now they have sold out to ""urban music"" I am sure they have exhausted every other possibility.Not only is it painful now knowing how they act in La Voz, seeing here, we can see that it is totally fake! These guys are not who they say they are!Don't waste your precious time like I did and skip this watch... Also what a horrible family dinamic on that ""roadtrip"", Montaner should abandon his acting intentions.",False
9,2,It is not as expected,karenhaum-38444,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've followed Ricardo for a very long time and was excited about this opportunity to get an insider look at his growing family but this is not good. Clearly Marlene runs the show, she's dominant and has no qualms on speaking her mind. Ricardo seems like a different person, I don't know if it's the Christianity or just something else but this one seems lost and out of touch. The children are all spoiled untalented brats that think they are the last Coca Cola in the world. The daughter seems like a total diva and her husband wanna be singer is missing personality. The other kids, you can tell that they also lack the down to earthness of their dad or that he used to have. Everyone seems so high maintenance, don't think they are even trying to act, it's just how they are. I don't like the part of pushing the Christianity to everyone and everybody, not all of us are believers. I was trying to watch with an open mind but clearly this was made just for a good pay day.",False
10,10,"Heart warming series, must watch for families",pyumpo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Loved these series and found it hard not to binge watch, so I kind of did. Really brought in so much needed positivity. Read a couple of the posted reviews and found them unfair and bizarre. The series was genuine so no ""acting"" or ""faking"" was shown or intended to be shown. They reminded me of my family in Peru and how we are so close knit and try to remember God in everything we do. I love how everyone is so different but have so much to contribute. I was particularly amazed at how artistic everyone is, really inspiring for people who are still fighting to achieve their life's purpose. Really hoping for a second season. Would love to learn more about Stef's and Sara's career and of course see how baby Apolo's arrival changed their lives once again.",False
11,10,Amazing Show! Love it!,marirristovska,n/a,15/08/2025,"I binge watched all available episodes (5 for now). The show is amazing, I love the content, I love all the characters. I can't wait to see more.It is a very refreshing and ""feel good"" reality show. In my opinion, I think it is one of the best reality shows that I have ever watched.I like the family bond that they are showing and the good values that they believe in. The content is clean, and appropriate for the audience. I like that we can learn about the Montaners from their direct perspective.Looking forward to see how the show will develop. I sincerely hope there will be more episodes soon and more seasons.",False
12,10,Great show!!,hjpjmgc,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am not a fluent Spanish speaker, but the show is not bad at all. I love that they mention the Lord a lot. It would be nice if they sung a few English songs because they have fans in the Spanish/English world. If you do not like the family, then I would not watch it. I can't wait for a second season. I wish they also showed more of Ricardo's older children. Ricardo, I never heard his voice before the show, but when I listened to Amen. I fell in love with his voice. Marlene, really is the pillar of the family. I like that she writes to the Lord and waits for the Lords reply. EL and Camilo, both adorable together and goofy. Sara and Mau, the love they share in the show is beautiful. Sara is strong headed. Ricky and Stefania, they are definitely twin flames. They act both alike. The show is not bad to watch. It is about family and like every family, there is strife and love. If you don't like it, then don't watch it.",False
13,10,Genuine Family,chachacediel,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show is a breath of fresh air. If your looking for high drama and betrayal, this definitely isn't the show for you. Finally, we see a family on reality TV who genuinely love each other and are committed to each other. This twisted world we live in could learn a lesson or two from this family about how to balance a high-profile career and family and how to honor and respect each other on the daily. This family is so real and down to earth, I've fallen in love with them all. I need more Montaner & Marlene, Ricky & Stef (and Mao), Mau & Sara, and Cami & Evaluna in my life...can't wait for Season 2!!",False

1,9,The most beautiful story in sports,ericsegerfeldt,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story of Messi's path to finally winning the World Cup is the most beautiful story ever in sports. This documentary does not really manage to do it justice since it excludes most of the background and all the years of disappointments and almosts. However, it captures the month in Qatar really well and manages to get the viewer to re-sense the emotions. Including valuable insight from players, ex-players as well as Argentinean and international journalists it only really lacks a contribution from the main man himself, Lionel Messi. BBC regularly produces documentaries very well worth a watch and this is certainly one of those.",False
2,7,"The man, the myth, the legend",oscarflash,n/a,16/08/2025,"For the movie I would say it was fine, not good or great but it was fine.As for the story and what we can say about success I think Messi defines new standards for success what it means and how to reach it regardless all the challenges and he also adds one more key factor to all people who reach greatness and that is GOD will make it happen.GOD will decide the end result and the end goal, GOD will draw a path and he will pave the way to those who believe in the ultimate success. Keeping in mind the talent alone is not enough, great effort is not enough.You need to have everything work hard, be talented or gain experience on how, additionally, you need GOD's will.Messi will be remembered in football history forever.",False

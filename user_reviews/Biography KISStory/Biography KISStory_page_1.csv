1,7,Cat-like reflexes required with your remotes volume buttons,whydoiwatchthiscrap,n/a,15/08/2025,"Interesting documentary. I learned a lot about the band that I hadn't known before.My gripe is that the sound mixing is a bit wonky. They have guitar riffs playing over someone speaking, which made it hard to hear everything they were saying. I found my televisions volume going up and down like a fiddler's elbow.Quiet talking *volume gradually increases*. SUDDEN BLAST OF GUITARS BLARING *panicked pressing of the volume down button*",False
2,7,Well done,Silicone54,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a life long KISS fan I truly enjoyed the intimate discussions of their careers, relationships and the band's longevity. Any fan will appreciate the old video footage and photos, some of which I have never seen before! There is a lot to take in covering their 70 years of personal and KISS history.I think they allotted a good amount of time discussing each and every member including the non-band members of KISS. Unfortunately, Ace and Peter declined to participate over money and control of the story of course. It is very sad that the same old issues cannot be resolved even after so many years apart.While I loved this documentary and understand why it required 2 parts, I can't say a casual viewer would want to sit through all of that. I think 7 stars is fair but if they were able to squeeze everything into 1 movie I'd give it a 9.",False
3,9,A Surprisingly Enjoyable Ride Even for a Casual Fan,sappybeans,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerEven This Non-Believer Enjoyed Biography: KISStory
My best friend is a card-carrying member of the KISS Army and got me to watch this documentary. I've never been a huge KISS fan, more of a casual listener, you know? But holy cow, this thing is a wild ride!Gene Simmons, the Demon himself, is exactly as you'd imagine, larger than life, full of himself, and utterly captivating. And Paul Stanley, the Starchild, is surprisingly insightful. He's the voice of reason amidst all the chaos.I was surprised by how honest they were about the band's struggles, the drug problems, the egos, the near-breakups. It's not just a glorified infomercial; they show the real side of things.But the music! Man, the music! Seeing those old concert clips, you can feel the energy. Even if you don't know every song, you can't help but get caught up in the spectacle.Honestly, I walked away from this with a newfound appreciation for KISS. They may be cheesy, but they're undeniably entertaining.My Rating: 8.5/10BTW Rock and Roll All Nite is still an absolute banger. ðŸ¤˜",True
4,10,Amazing!.,dayton-w-price,n/a,15/08/2025,"Kiss is my favorite American rock band. And I loved every minute of it. I learned some new stuff I didn't know before. If your a die hard Kiss fan like me, you'll love it too.",False
5,10,Excellent revealing doc of the best legendary head banging band of all time!,blanbrn,n/a,15/08/2025,"Finally after almost a year finally watched this documentary which first aired as a Biography special in two parts on ""A&E"". I must say it was great and a super revealing hot eye opening look at the legendary rock band ""Kiss"". Shown was classic vintage clips and footage of concerts, band meetings, and other music insiders spoke of the impact that ""Kiss"" had on pop culture. Interviews are deeply touching and emotional as the two leads Paul Stanley and Mr. Big the face of ""Kiss"" himself Gene Simmons spill both their guts hard and humble about the 5 decade life of the band. From the humble start to the stardom, and the ups and downs the band had with Ace and Peter it's all shown and talked about. The influence of the ""New York Dolls"" and ""Phantom of the Opera"" is revealed as these two things help start the band and the record deals and live playing before the band had radio play helped make the band. Each album and song is talked about also and how it impacted the band and it's fans. ""Kiss"" an underdog band did it their way and always swam like sharks and smelled the blood of rock n' roll. Overall a must see doc for any ""Kiss"" fan and music pop culture buff as it will have one rocking all night forever and thanking god for rock n' roll ""Kiss"" style! Plus this doc is informative as I learned personal stuff about Paul, Gene, and the band too really a must see.",False
6,10,Very Enjoyable!!!,Maxax777,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved this thing, and Kiss is not my favorite band by far - but I don't care who you are - you have to have appreciation for Kiss! Kiss is a one of a kind - a unique mix of ""we probably should have just completely failed, yet instead we are one of the biggest and best there has ever been!""It's a fun look back at the history and early days, and great to see that everyone in the Kiss family is involved and recognized! I even learned a few things! It's a well done show, and it's very enjoyable to watch! Oh, plus - it's not just full of filth and sex, drugs, and rock n roll - it's more about the band and their desires!Hard work - pays off!!!",False
7,5,Good but!!,Marynewcomb2013,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerDon't get me wrong, this gal loves Kiss but not the mockery the band became from 2002 to now!! You are getting Paul & Gene's story as always!! You didn't get the part where Gene went to Ace's birthday in 2002! Gene showed up to beg Ace to come back!! There is video proof of Gene carrying the cake to Ace!!Should Ace & Peter gotten equal pay & say during the reunion to farewell tour, YES! What people fail to realize is Kiss was just another band who couldn't sell out arena's during the non makeup years! The conventions were for nostalgic reason & they basically touch on that in this documentary!! Ace & Peter put them back on top & selling out stadiums & arena's once again! That shows why they should have been equal!!Also, was Ace & Peter to blame for the band falling apart in the late 70's, not completely! Gene & Paul are just as much to blame as the other two!! Paul was partying with Ave & Peter but cleaned up around 77! When Gene & Paul seen the cracks forming, they should have taken a step back & said, we need a brake for the sack of the band!! They didn't do that & carried on with album after album, tour after tour & merchandise! Kiss comic, really? Ace has talked many times about the band becoming merchandising & Peter talked many times about album tour, album tour, album tour & so on then a lame movie!! He was burnt out but Paul & Gene couldn't see it!!You have to look at the whole picture & not just what they say individually or a team like Gene & Paul!! Gene & Paul refused to play a couple of songs with Ace & Peter at the R&R hall of fame induction for crying out loud!! To Gene & Paul, Kiss hasn't been a band for decades but a BUSINESS!! As long as they can keep making that money, they will keep pushing merchandise out & continue to put imposters up on stage!! Those two could have easily taken the makeup back off & carried on without conflict among those of us in the Kiss Army!!",True
8,n/a,For the footage,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerPaul and Gene were correct when they say that without them Kiss would have died 15 years prior. But if Ace had said forget it, pay me the same as you or I'm not doing the reunion, they would have no choice. Without Ace and Peter, there is no reunion, which totally saved the band.Also, they blame Ace and Peter for the demise of 1970's Kiss. Forget about how terrible Paul's songs were on Dynasty, Unmasked and The Elder. That's what killed the band. Peter's behavior was bad though - they should've kicked him out of the band after the on stage BS.The footage is great, of course. I think the Eric Carr death was handled well too. The first part was really cool - the second part was revisionist history.",True

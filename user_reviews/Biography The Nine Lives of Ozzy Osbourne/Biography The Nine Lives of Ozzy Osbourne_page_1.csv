1,9,All Hail (Sir) Ozzy Osbourne,joebloggz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the most warts & all & downright honest career documentaries I've ever seen about a Rock N Roll or (as in this case) living Heavy Metal legend that is Ozzy...it covers the sort of from-childhood-life-to-Rock-Star, the all-too-inevitable downfall due to alcohol & drugs, to coming out the other side to present day that normally you only find in a long autobiography...it's raw, it's blatantly honest, contains some very sad & (full props to Ozzy, Sharon & their family for doing so) they bear their souls, their demons & yet their light-hearted view of life's bad times & share themselves & the music through it all...which is of course what kicked it all off, provides the magic, but can also be the cause of the darkside...just a wonderful, brilliant documentary on a genuine & honest working class bloke, who inspired generations of music lovers, fellow musicians & TV Reality show addicts all in one...he's unique!!",False
2,8,the real Iron Man,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. My concern going in was that A&E would serve up a heavy dose of modern day Ozzy Osbourne, especially since this profile is directed by Greg Johnston, the producer of the popular reality TV show, ""The Osbournes"" (2002-05). Instead, the nine lives are divided up for various segments throughout Ozzy's life (he's 72 years old now), and seem to be weighted fairly ... highlighting warts, family, and achievements.The first ""Life"" segment takes Ozzy back to Birmingham, England where he spent his childhood. He and wife Sharon tour his early home - a home that now has an indoor toilet, a luxury not available to young Ozzy. We learn Ozzy had three sisters and two brothers, and that Birmingham was a blue color town lined with factories. Both of Ozzy's parents were factory workers. Dad took the day shift, Mom the night shift. Ozzy explains that he hated school, and enjoyed his multitude of factory jobs even less. His eyes sparkle as he recalls how first hearing The Beatles inspired him to move towards music.It's at this point when we hear from guitarist Tony Iommi, drummer Bill Ward, and bassist Geezer Butler, the founding members, along with Ozzy, of Black Sabbath. This was 4 local lads who were pioneers in heavy metal rock music. Producer Rick Rubin talks about their influence, and how they started as a blues band and evolved into much harder and louder music. They sold many albums and became huge touring the UK and USA. Their second album ""Paranoid"" included the monster hit ""Iron Man"", a true rock anthem. As you might know (or guess), Ozzy had significant issues with booze and drugs, and in 1979, he was fired by the band.Many rock careers have ended due to addiction, but as the title infers, Ozzy manages to continually land on his feet. His new band, with talented guitarist Randy Rhoads, became huge, and the album ""Blizzard of Oz"" contained the megahit ""Crazy Train"". During this time, Ozzy began his relationship with Sharon, the daughter of his manager. It was also during this era when Ozzy's reputation as a wild man (or mad man) on stage blossomed ... highlighted by shocking behavior at the record company offices and on stage (you've likely heard the live bat story). He was also banned from San Antonio for good reason. Disaster struck in 1982, but it was also the year Ozzy and Sharon wed.Sharon, and Ozzy's kids Jack and Kelly, are forthcoming in the stories they tell. It's clear they love Ozzy, despite not always understanding his behavior. Ozzy is often shown watching clips of his live performances, and by the end, we fully comprehend that music and his family are both extraordinarily important to him ... and he gives full credit to Sharon for his still being alive (a fact as stunning as Keith Richards still being with us).The film does go into Ozzy's retirement from performing, as well as the popular TV show with his family. The vintage clips are fun to watch, and all of the people interviewed (including an honest and often funny Ozzy) have fascinating insight to a remarkable life. It's likely not many recall his days as the ""Prince of Darkness"", but as Kelly says, Ozzy is ""the real Iron Man"".",False
3,9,Ozzy is doing fine,a291072,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nice to see Ozzy is still alive and more or less well.
He speaks normally now.
If you have read the books and seen the documentaries, this biography offers little news.
So if you haven't, this is a must watch for Ozzy fans.",False
4,10,"if you haven't seen this, do yourself a favor!",kennethohair,n/a,16/08/2025,"From new fans, to old fans, everyone will love this documentary. i wish it could have been hours longer! if you have a deep love for Ozzy i suggest some tissues as well, it has its very real and emotional moments to it. quite odd how close you can feel to someone without knowing them, and that, is another reason why ozzy and his legacy will stand forever.ðŸ–¤ 10/10",False
5,10,Loved it,mikeiskorn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fantastic documentary! I love anything to do with Ozzy. I love his tv programs more than his music, sometimes haha.",False
6,6,Heightened reality,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rock star Ozzy Osbourne has certainly lived an interesting life. Born in Birmingham, he's the man who bit the head off a live bat on stage, and latterly the star of a massively popular reality TV show. You could say he's the closest thing to 'Spinal Tap' in the real world. A documentary about him could hardly be dull, and this one isn't, but it's not that insightful either. Why did Ozzy become an addict? How did his music relate to that of his peers? What actually induced him to make a reality TV programme? You don't really get a feeling for any of the answers, instead he comes across almost like the old man in the pub, claiming extraordinary stories (""yeah, I did that!"") that no-one quite believes. The overall effect is of a highlights (and lowlights) package of his life; but a more critical evaluation might have been more interesting.",False
7,10,The Godfather of metal,brentgray73,n/a,16/08/2025,"OZZY, the best ever. No more needs to be said...except it says review is to short",False
8,10,Rock God,ian-87352,n/a,16/08/2025,"A brilliant, shocking but truthful bio of my childhood hero, any Ozzy fan must watch any Ozzy sceptic must watch, it will change you.",False
9,4,Only part of the story,glynenergy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Look, let me first say I love Sabbath and I have everything Ozzy has ever done as well. I grew up to the soundtrack of their music and it is part of my life.However this documentary lost its credibility to me instantly when I realised that it purposely left people out.Note, hardly a word from Tony Iommi, who lets face it, was the leader of Black Sabbath. You cannot tell this story without Iommi. There would be no Sabbath without Iommi. This was done I suspect because Sharon Osborne still does not like him. Either way leaving him out was a gross error, or indeed on prupose.BUT the worse thing that ruined it to me was the removing from history two of the people who actually WROTE Blizzard of Oz and Diary of a Madman with Ozzy and Randy. Namely; Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake. And then were the excellent rhythm section that contributed so much to it.At one point they show a picture of the rehearsals for the first album. A well known picture that has Daisley in it. In this documentary he was EDITED OUT. Live footage too was cropped to remove them and only show Osborne and Rhodes. What a pathetic and petty sham, especially as the great Kerslake has now died.I detect the hand of Sharon on this who had a problem when they asked for royalties and disgracefully rerecorded the album without them to remove their claims.So this is an OK documentary, ruined by purposefully erasing people from it for various reasons who were part of it.",False
10,3,HUGE leaps and gaps...,NullUnit,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's very cursory look at the early years.. then a LOT of focus on current storylines.For a ""biography"" it's EXCEPTIONALLY lacking.Where are his first 2 children from the first wife?? Why the divorce? How'd Sabbath get a deal? So may missing bits just to tell the story the publicist wants told in 2020. It's CLEARLY spin and just skips some things to keep the overall impression as good.Sure the entire cause of any abuse or mistrust was alcohol and drugs... couldn't have anything to do with Ozzy be just an unkind person at heart.. and truth being exposed through substances.Meh... it's marketing spin.. nothing more.",False

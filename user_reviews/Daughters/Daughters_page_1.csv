1,8,Profound and moving,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.""Daughters"" won the Audience Awards for Festival Favorite and U. S. Documentary which is well-deserved because the documentary is a great exploration of how prison is horrifying, the connections between fathers and daughters who are separated because of prison, and the challenging both sides are able to encounter.With strong visual presentation, discussions, and insightful conversations, filmmakers Angela Patton and Natalie Rae were able to create a profound and meaningful documentary and the themes and concepts that were explored are well-executed. Each moments that were handled felt genuine and I did get emotional when watching this one.Overall, it's one experience to witness especially for parents and families.",False
2,9,An intimate & humanistic portrayal of inmates and their daughters.,ggnavedd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Attended this screening last minute at the Hot Docs Film Festival and so glad I did.This is a must watch documentary to see the father-daughter dance program at a prison in DC. Witness the unraveling emotions before, during & after the dance and how such a night was a life changing moment for inmates experiencing a glimpse of fatherhood for a moment in time. The effects of incarceration is sentimentally portrayed through families dealing with visitation limitations and the diminishing intimacy daughters have with their fathers behind bars as they progress through childhood.This dance program being implemented in prisons across America has been proven to drastically reduce reincarnation rates of inmates and this emotional documentary shows why.",False
3,9,An Emotional Tragedy,candystar-07467,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this film with my dad after seeing the trailer because I thought that it would be an awfully wholesome but touching film. Turns out, that it was gut-wrenching and so sad yet happy. During the last few minutes of the movie my father hugged me while we watched the movie. Honestly, that simple action made me cry even more as the story delved into the aftermath of the Dad and Daughter dance. Everything from the cinematography, dialogue, and use of music and sounds made me cry. I think the most touching of the kids was Aubrey. The simple dialogue of her father telling her that she's either going to see him when she's twelve or thirteen is heartbreaking. She keeps saying twelve until they agree on that age. It hurts even more after the movie ends when it says that his sentence ended up being ten years. I truly believe that this is one of the most emotionally painful movies of this year, and that it's one of the best documentaries that I've ever watched. I absolutely recommend this movie to whoever wants to ask me. Though, I do have to mention that it will leave you in tears from the get go.",True
4,10,We Have To Do More,caseypthompson,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was incredibly moved by this film. I happened upon it on a streaming service. From the beginning it was beautiful and heartbreaking. The first moment I cried is when I saw the love and anxiety and fear in the father's faces when they talked about seeing their daughters again. Holding them, connecting with them. I entirely lost it when the girls were walking down the hallway, finding their fathers one by one and seeing the tears on the men's faces.And to be completely honest, I also feel this sense of shame and anger as a white person. WE created this problem. We put BIPOC people in this predicament over 200 years ago and kept them there. Shackling them to a way of living that is normalized in many African American communities. We white people and our fathers and their fathers before us have kept pulling black men and women down every time they try and take a step up.We give many of these black communities a ladder to climb to higher spaces in society and say ""look, we believe in equal rights and opportunity""...but then rip it out beneath them the moment they try. If every time you tried to keep climbing up the ladder to benefit yourself and those around you and society kept pushing you off, eventually it's all you know and you eventually just stop reaching. It's what their parents knew, their grandparents, their great-grandparents and all their ancestors before them.In so many BIPOC communities, ending up in jail and prison is just a part of life. But it shouldn't be normalized. We have to correct this problem somehow. We have to fight for better education for children, free mental and physical healthcare, free access to adult education, more programs that provide lower prices and interest for new and better homes and neighborhoods, more community centers, higher education and opportunities in the prison systems, a better appreciation and celebration of their culture and diversity and to completely uproot the justice system altogether and fix it.The system is rigged on purpose and the white community isn't doing enough to fight back. We don't do enough to support black-owned businesses. We don't lift up the BIPOC individuals that are fighting to better themselves and their communities. All of this knowledge running through my heart as I watch these fathers with their daughters, really pulled at my soul and cracked it.We have to do more. We have to be more. Period.",False
5,10,Powerful and truthful,originlove,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a VERY raw look at a program designed for fathers to get to have a dance date with their daughters while incarcerated.There's no skimping the rough parts that are the realities that come with both the young children getting this rare opportunity and that aren't easy for them emotionally. Neither is it a field day for the men who aren't just some ""hardened criminal"" behind bars. They are men who truly understand what they're missing, as well as the harms from their actions, to their daughters.It's also a moving, up close, personal experience for us to share these precious moments with them. The ""roller coaster"" as they stated. If you are in touch with your human side, the side that makes mistakes, or the parent that you may be, then you may be like me... crying through most parts of this documentary.It's unlike most prison documentaries. It's one about the families on the inside and the other side of the barbed wire fence. What power those constraints hold.Oh! And the youngest daughter and her father are two of the most beautiful people highlighted during this story.",False
6,n/a,One of the most important and emotional documentaries ever!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is so important! It is so important for a lot of people to see, especially for those who live in America. I hope all the dads in this documentary have a close relationship with their daughters no matter happens. I hope more and more jails and prisons have this dance and that more and more change happens with these families. It was so emotional and beautiful to see these daughters with their fathers. I really hope good things and good seasons and good times happen for these families and protection and safety for them as well. So many people need to see to see what so many black men go through and black families go through.",False
7,7,Prepare to cry,golfcruise,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beware of when watching, your tears will want to flow no matter how hard you try to fight. A touching debut documentary from Angela Patton and Natalie Rae, Daughters is a showcase of the surplus of emotions the Date With Dad program brings to these young girls' lives. At times the film feels like it battles its own structure, leaving a questionable trail of decisions that made me think it would diminish what came before, however, such was not the case. Small decisions like shooting the dance on film made the experience more tangible and effective, ensuring the heart of the documentary never withers away.",False
8,10,I don't know what to say. You will cry.,asemle-86686,n/a,16/08/2025,"You know when you haven't cried in a long time, and you get that sort of frog in your throat? You will cry. I don't think I've seen so much sincere expression of emotion in any movie, which was cathartic for me. I am crying right now thinking about it. Sundance 2024 was a good festival for authentic, heartfelt stories like this, with ""Look into my Eyes"" coming in second (also highly recommended).Daughters is the true life ""aftersun"", all true stories of girls who are growing up separated from their dads. It was so, so well done.Made me think I should call my dad. Walked into the freshmarket after having this thought and ""call me maybe"" was playing. Maybe I will call him. Idk what else to say.This should absolutely win an Oscar.",False
9,7,Daughters,jboothmillard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm always interested to find new documentary feature films with subjects I may not know about, and I found this one, made by Netflix which won the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, when it was nominated during Awards Season. Basically, filmed in 2019, it focuses on a unique American social bonding program in a Washington D. C. prison for incarcerated fathers and their daughters. It follows four families with young girls and the men who fathered them as they prepare for ""Date with Dad"" and the ""Daddy Daughter Dance"". The men in prison are seen discussing their regrets, fears and wishes surrounding this prom-style event held within the prison. The girls discuss their thoughts on what it will be like to reunite with their dads, good and bad, and some of the mothers give their opinions of it as well. When it comes to the dance itself, we see the nervous but joyous reunions of fathers and daughters, with the men well-suited and the girls in pretty dresses. They sit at tables reconnecting and jig together on the setup dancefloor. There are also aftermath moments, pleasant and bleak, with a range of different outcomes on display that solidify the observations of the U. S. prison system and how it affects not only the inmates but their loved ones as well. It is difficult to watch in some scenes, particularly towards the end, but the tender scenes of the participants and the feeling of love and community are most satisfactory. If you are looking for an alternative insight into things that go on in jail, this is a most interesting, heart-warming and sort-of feel-good documentary. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Documentary. Very good!",True
10,10,Not just another prison documentary.,Whataloadof123,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNot like any other prison documentaries I have ever seen. I liked how you got to see how being in prison impacts not just the incarcerated but the impact on the children and families. How decisions made by the prison industrial complex doesn't take into the account the importance of physical connection between parent and child when it comes to visitations. The most adorable, articulate little girl demonstrated the palpable gapping wound of an absentee incarcerated parent and the affects over time and the importance of dad daughter dance programs as one of the girls went from this hardened 10 year old to being sweet and innocent again once her father got out. Clearly this program taught those men the impact of their decisions, which can be a cruel if you have a 10 year or life sentence as what are going to do about that? How can you keep a bond with children that you can't touch as you talk to them through a video? I felt such raw emotion for those children. So painful to watch but definitely a must watch as opens your eyes.",True
11,6,Daughters,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"A group of incarcerated fathers are promised the opportunity to have a dance with their young daughters after they undergo some sessions with a counsellor who encourages discussion between them about what the relationship with their children means to each of them. Meantime, we are introduced to the entertainingly enthusiastic Aubrey who is desperate to see her father and who serves as a conduit to other mothers and children who are - with varying degrees of wholeheartedness - involved in this project. Across the next hundred minutes or so, we follow the preparation and anticipation on both sides before the children duly arrive for their brief and emotional afternoon. What got me about this whole thing is the director's decision not to inform us as to just why these men are in jail in the first place. With sentences ranging from the short to thirty years, I quickly felt I was being lured into a feeling of sympathy for individuals about whom I knew practically nothing. As none of the men themselves seemed keen to elaborate own what crimes actually put them in jail, I began to wonder if they were just hard-luck, petty, thieves or serial rapists. Might the youngsters actually be better off without their dads? It's set amidst a prison in Washington D. C. so it does offer us an occasionally interesting look at some aspects of African American familial culture and attitudes but again, it doesn't try to put much meat on any bones from the perspective of the spouses about coping or raising the children in difficult circumstances. The aim of the scheme to reconcile (compulsorily) estranged fathers and daughters is laudable enough, but this documentary really only presents us with a rather incomplete and selective character study. It might work better as a two-part television documentary, but as a cinema piece it's a bit of an unrewarding slog.",False
12,10,Touching,Millyviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"Real, raw, and emotional. You could feel the genuine desire to become better from the fathers for their daughters. I loved the pure, unfiltered, and honest views from both the the fathers and daughters. I loved the soundtrack. I shed tears of joy and sadness because at the end of the day, we all need that unconditional love. I also enjoyed seeing the girls grow and point of view change. The passion from the mentors was beautiful, it was uplifting and you could tell it helped improve their self esteem and confidence. The documentary was beautifully produced and directed. I also applaud the family's for being vulnerable and honest. Beautiful. Ps. Have some tissues nearby.",False
13,7,Bad fathers...,lilianaoana,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched it because it is highly rated in LB's Year In Review in the Documentary category and it's readily available on Netflix. I didn't have any particular interest in it when it came out tbh.I'm not gonna lie, I felt sorry for these girls and I may have shed a tear or two at the dance and I agree dads are important to girls, but I'm finding it hard to feel sorry for the men. They are not the ones who deserve my sympathy here. It's smart that the documentary never mentions the crimes for which they were incarcerated, but it's not something small. Some of them have very lengthy sentences and repeat incarcerations. By their own admission they kept getting into trouble and couldn't manage to stay out of jail. Not one of them says they are innocent of the crime. It may have been a condition for approval into the program not to have that discourse though.Anyway, these girls' lives are rough as it is, being from poor families, with struggling mothers and black. One teen girl is depressed without her father, one ten year old has to grow up and replace her dad due to a clueless, problematic mom, and a five year old is gonna grow up into a perfectionist with self-esteem issues because her dad keeps telling her to get all the certificates (awards) she can get to make up for his failed life. This man gets a 30 year sentence. Can you imagine? In the space of three years after the dance the girl starts to distance herself from him and probably resent him. It sadly makes a lot of sense.",False
14,5,Sorry...,asc85,n/a,16/08/2025,"...but it's just not very good. I mean, the critic reviews are high, and I even looked at the amateur IMDb reviews to see what they thought, and at least at this writing, it was very high. So what could go wrong in seeing it? Firstly, as I find in many documentary reviews, people confuse the story that the documentary is based on with the actual execution of this project. Is the story of this program heartbreaking, and should it be supported (at least on a trial basis) throughout the United States? Well, I think it's obvious that the answer is yes. But what about the film itself? Sorry, it just wasn't very good. With the exception of the dance party itself, it was very slow to get through. I think the party itself was maybe only one-third of the screentime, and certainly could have been shown much longer, as it was a six hour event. And that little girl Aubrey was adorable. But other than that, I am puzzled at the super positive reviews this film has received.",False
15,8,"Power of touching,heals so many wounds",vigneshvv-99358,n/a,16/08/2025,"The power of touching is so meaningful.When childrens are removed from touching their parent,they doubt the possibility of surviving in the World.The baby is aware of the human connection amd respond to being protected and loved. The Baby yearns for touch.And as we get older,we continue to yearn from that,and it heals so many wounds.Even sometimes those wounds sting, you're like, ""Wow it probably would have been a more open wound for a longer time, if i didn't take care of it""Alonzo recieved a sentence of 30 year's.that shocked meWow this documentary is so artful with mixture of guilt,shame,loveless, human emotions.Angela Patton and Natalie Rae Directed this documentary very well ...

16,9,Raw & Important,shilomerritt,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was raw and important. It was real experiences of how important a father is to their daughter. No matter what socioeconomic status, fathers have a significant influence in a daughter's life. The importance of those who were leaders within the correctional facilities that were able to identify that this kind of raw personal experience is so important, should not be shadowed. This is rehabilitation, not only within the correctional facility, but also within the community. THIS IS HOW WE HEAL.The daughters who were brave enough to share and display their experiences to the world. This will forever be apart of their story. The hope for the daughters to allow healthy male relationships to enter their lives, and to the fathers to allow for this rehabilitation to continue to allow them to heal and to be productive citizens within their communities.",False
17,10,Powerful Tearjerker,Kmdoug222,n/a,16/08/2025,"I called my dad after I watched this and thanked him for being a constant provider and safety for me as his daughter. I didn't mind that they didn't share what the men did to end up in prison cause I personally don't think it matters. I think that what matters is who they are going forward and the intimate relationships with their little girls. I loved the very first quote, ""Our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve and how they see us for the rest of our lives"". Such true words. It was heartbreaking, beautiful, powerful, and moving. A true testament of the importance of fatherhood and the relationship between father and daughter. I will pray that each of these girls has a reconciled relationship with their dads and that they heal together.",False
18,10,Dancing Through the Bars,pinkmanboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some films remind us that cinema, above all, is a window into humanity. ""Daughters,"" co-directed by Angela Patton and Natalie Rae, is one of those. The documentary isn't just a portrait of the ""Daddy Daughter Dances"" Patton organizes in prisons; it's a deeply moving study of reconnection, vulnerability, and the pursuit of redemption, told with the sensitivity that only such personal stories deserve.The narrative focuses on four girls and their emotional journeys with fathers who are behind bars. Patton and Rae are careful not to present the girls merely as victims of circumstance. They're shown as complex individuals with dreams, fears, and a resilience that defies their age. Aubrey, for instance, impresses with her precocious intelligence and obsession with numbers, which she uses to calculate how much longer until she sees her dad again. Meanwhile, ten-year-old Santana carries the weight of being ""the man"" of her family, and Ja'Ana and Raziah, at different ages, cope with their fathers' absence in ways that range from raw pain to bitter cynicism.But the documentary doesn't stop at capturing the girls' stories. It also gives voice to the fathers-men who, even in a punitive environment, are trying to rewrite their narratives. One of the most impactful moments comes during the preparation for the dance, when the dads trade their orange uniforms for suits and ties. This simple act holds powerful symbolism: it's more than dressing up-it's a gesture of dignity, a reminder of what it means to be seen as something more than an inmate number or a past mistake.The decision not to delve into the crimes that brought these men to prison is a wise one. The focus here isn't on judgment but on humanity. As one memorable line in the documentary suggests, ""Nobody is as bad as their worst day."" The film wholeheartedly believes that. What matters is what happens when these men are with their daughters, even if only for a few hours: a space where vulnerabilities turn into strengths, reconnection feels possible, and both fathers and daughters are allowed, for a moment, to simply be family.The aesthetics of ""Daughters"" also stand out. Michael Fernandez's cinematography takes a lyrical approach, using soft slow-motion effects to capture the innocence of the girls and the emotional weight of lost time. The soundtrack complements the film's tone perfectly, adding layers of depth without ever feeling manipulative. These visual and auditory choices elevate the documentary, transforming everyday moments into small emotional epiphanies.The most impactful scenes, however, are in the interactions between fathers and daughters. The documentary allows us to witness these relationships being rebuilt in real time. Watching one father teach another how to tie a tie or hand a flower to his daughter at the end of the dance are gestures laden with meaning-small acts that encapsulate years of unspoken love and deep regret. These details could easily slip into cheap sentimentality, but Patton and Rae handle them with care, letting the moments speak for themselves.More than a film about separated families, ""Daughters"" is also a subtle critique of the prison system and its failure to foster rehabilitation and humanity. The success of the fatherhood program, with a recidivism rate of just 5%, is proof that real change is possible when people are given the chance to reconnect with what truly matters. Yet the film also reminds us of the systemic barriers in place, like the replacement of in-person visits with expensive, impersonal video calls, which only deepen the wounds.In the end, what lingers from ""Daughters"" is a celebration of the strength of family bonds and the idea that even in the hardest circumstances, there's room for healing and hope. The film challenges us to see beyond people's mistakes and recognize the transformative power of a dance, a hug, or a single moment. As one father says, ""For those six hours, I wasn't incarcerated."" And that fleeting sense of freedom-for fathers and daughters alike-is the true soul of this extraordinary documentary.",False
19,10,The Reality of Incarceration on a Family,DVK1234,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm sitting here so sad. America's prison system is wrong. Why no touch visits? This is punishing more than just the prisoner. These girls need to know their father. There needs to be a relationship, something for the dads to work towards. When I watched the Netflix series about the world's toughest prisons, there were some countries that spent a lot of money on a system of imprisonment but combined with rehabilitation with the goal of the prisoner being released with actual skills and a chance to truly have a real chance as a free man.How tragic was the update on Aubrey. So much joy, so much hope, when she spent the evening with her father Kevin at the dance. Fast forward three years, and eight year old Aubrey no longer recognizes her dad, and the visit is no touch, plexiglass separating the pair. She asks if she can leave. In the car, on the way back home, the joy has left this little girl. She's speaking to her dad on the phone, but it seems like a tedious exercise. My heart breaks. So incredibly sad for a child to look that weary.",False
20,9,Daughters is a well-executed documentary on a unique topic that deserves the attention it receives.,kevin_robbins,n/a,16/08/2025,"My wife and I recently watched the docuseries Daughters (2024) on Netflix. The story centers around a program initiated in Virginia and implemented at a prison in Washington, DC. The program helps inmates understand the importance of fatherhood, offering their daughters the chance to participate in a prison-based daddy/daughter dance. Throughout the series, we follow the fathers as they engage in various lessons, witnessing the frustrations of the young girls in their lives and the glimmer of hope both sides share for a brighter future.Co-created by Angela Patton and Natalie Rae, the docuseries does an excellent job of focusing on the mindsets and lifestyles of both the fathers and daughters. I was impressed by how well the documentary stays on topic, avoiding the fathers' past mistakes or the reasons for their incarceration. Instead, it explores how fathers impact their daughters' lives-sometimes positively, sometimes negatively. We see the emotional gaps in the little girls' souls and the potential for them to inspire their dads to adopt a better mindset and approach to life. Some situations are hopeful, others frustrating, but all are sad, leaving you hoping they can find peace and a path forward.In conclusion, Daughters is a well-executed documentary on a unique topic that deserves the attention it receives. I'd rate it 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",False

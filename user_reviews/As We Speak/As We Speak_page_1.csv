1,7,How We Define Rap Music,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.While I don't listen to rap music as much, this documentary is an interesting exploration of rap music, the lyrics, and how rap music has been taken advantage by the court system to criminalize and make Black individuals look bad. Director J. M. Harper uses music, beautiful presentation and an interesting main lead from Bronx rap artist Kemba. Kemba narration and Harper's direction on the documentary does a good job on exploring the musical genre of what makes rap interesting, the issues of how black individuals are treated by the system, and the conflicts it has created.Despite some strange odd editing choices and some slow pacing, the documentary was highly informative and a good watch for those who want to examine rap music and the politics.",False

2,10,Powerful!,xgdhntxgd,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI couldn't stop crying watching this movie, it was heart wrenching to watch. To know that this really happened and isn't a made up story, makes it all the more powerful. Please watch this film, even if it's hard. These are real stories from real people and they deserve and need to have their voices heard. We must stop this from happening ever again. We must believe these women and show them empathy for what they and their families have gone through. These are crimes against humanity, and certainly show the brutal, cruel side of people. We must all know what happened, and protect these innocents and help them recuperate.",True
3,10,A must see,winterliz,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's time that everyone understand the truth of what happened on that dark day. ""Screams before silence,"" is so important and I wish we could make it required viewing before voicing opinions on the 7th of October especially for those who STILL continue to deny these atrocities... despite the mountains of evidence and testimonies.We will never forget these women, we will scream for those whose souls have been extinguished and whose voices have been silenced.Beautifully done, painful to watch but necessary. Thank you to Sheryl Sandberg for telling these stories in a delicate snd sensitive fashion.",True
4,10,Sharing with the world,gorenjo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerShares the horrors of October 7th with the world. Thank you for documenting the barbarism of that awful day. Everyone needs to know what happened in Israel on that day. There is so much misinformation
in the world and this documents what really happened. It is raw and honest and speaks to people that were there. Thank you Sheryl Sandsberg. The world must learn what truly happened. I hope more people will
learn what happened and learn the truth about the unspeakable things that happened on that day. I will be haunted by it forever. Go watch it and learn from the people who were there about what truly happened.",True
5,10,I wish I could give it more stars,buckholdvirginia,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHeartbreaking, moving, outrage inducing and powerful presentation of actual events. If it doesn't open your eyes, your heart and your mind you are not watching. Difficult, but necessary to watch in order to understand the broader implications for the world. I have never seen a more important and timely documentary. The only regret is that the events are true and are continuing. Although the events are difficult to see and the ability to commit such atrocities painful to absorb, this work will endure as a lasting memorial to the ugliness of hate and the need for humanity to change its current course.",True
6,10,Absolutely powerful and worth watching!,AMJ-Fan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm not sure why other people are giving it a one star review; I have to assume they don't like documentaries or think Transformers was the height of cinema. Regardless, this is a gut-wrenching but excellent film. An important watch for any who want to cut through politics and media nonsense and just see facts. It's well done, well shot, and worth every minute... but it's definitely not something to watch while the kids are in the room with you or while you fold up the laundry. Purposefully put some time aside and view this, then look into some aftercare.Witnessing history is never for the meek.",True
7,10,Your review is a reflection of you as a person,rosenbergdara,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film was as powerful as I expected it would be. I have read and heard a lot of stories since October 7 but still managed to learn so much. It's so important for these women's voices and stories to be captured and preserved for as long as the memory of this attack will haunt us.Even if a person don't think this movie is of the highest production quality or they don't like that Sheryl Sandberg was present, it deserves one star???? You can pick it apart, but you can't deny truth. You can't deny or invalidate someone's lived experience. This film was a collection of undeniably real and raw emotional accounts and footage of a horrific attack. Thank you to the brave women who shared their story.",True

9,10,incredibly powerful necessary,e_soweto,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIncredibly powerful and necessary documentary. I am grateful to Sheryl Sandberg for showing the world what happened on that horrific day. ""Screams Before Silence"" is a must-see for anyone who appreciates intelligent storytelling and powerful documentaries. This is an important documentary of the brutal mass r*pe that day. People are trying to deny the atrocities that occurred, even with streamed footage - videos by the attackers themselves. I can't believe we live in a world where people are denying what actually went on that day. Watch this and bear witness. Violence against women and israeli women cannot be forgotten.",True
10,10,Heartbreaking to watch but we can't look away,dblesless-34422,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI went back and forth over whether or not I would watch this film. I had already seen some of the footage from the body cams on the October 7 attack and I just didn't know if my heart could take watching more. I realize that I couldn't look away because that's exactly how World War II happened was people deliberately looking away because the truth was too uncomfortable. This film reaffirmed my brief that we can't look away and be afraid of speaking out. We cannot ""put our heads in the sand"" and ignore what happened and is still happening. Please please everyone watch this film and use your voice to speak out against hatred so no one has to go through atrocities like the 10/07/23 attacks again!",True
11,10,A heartbreaking must watch,treehuggerzoe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn incredibly important documentary that sheds light on the atrocities committed during the Oct 7 terrorist attacks. The film presents a thorough recount of the terrible things survivors had to go through. Portraying firsthand survivor accounts, archival footage from videos taken by the actual terrorists, and experts analyzing the situation, it is a well-researched documentary done with empathy and heart. It's unnerving that sexual violence is still so commonly used as a war weapon and even worse that survivors are not being believed. This is a must watch for everyone willing to learn the truth, this should never happen again.",True
12,10,The truth,kris-92552,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCried the entire film. A heart wrenching film Everyone must see bring humanity back. Thank you to the Director for putting the truth out there what happened and what should never happen again. This film should be in every theater and we can't turn our eyes away from such horrific barbaric disgusting disturbing footage hard to watch, but it's a must.I don't know how sheryl Sandberg got through that must've been heart, wrenching for her as well to see it in person and hear from the survivors and talk to families that still have family members that are hostages how do you not feel for these people.",True
13,10,Outstanding,ischia-51881,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA must watch. Packed with vulnerability and emotion, this interview highlighting the horrors faced by those kept captive will provide the viewer with an in depth understanding of the horrors of terrorism. It's impossible not to feel shock, dismay, disgust, fear and gratitude (for your own safety with the privilege of watching from your safe and comfortable home). I am hopeful there are more of these documentary/interviews to come as having a first hand account of history in real time is a privilege and honor. The cinematography and raw emotion displayed to be admired. I am hopeful this finds its way to major main stream networks.",True
14,10,Must watch to understand the events,furnituresaleu,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerReal talk -- just scrolling through some bot-fed reviews that don't relate at all to the actual film or that came from a team of TikTok viewers who rallied together to lower the ratings.What Sandberg did here was create a canvas for us to view the dispicable, indisputable events these innocent people went through and create our own interpretations. The events of Ten-Seven will never be forgotten, especially by those who have suffered through the grief. This is the film to watch to have some grounding of what took place and why we can't turn a blind eye. Watch this instead of eating tide pods and you'll actually do something beneficial with your life.",True
15,10,Accurate & Vitally Important Viewing,doronmichelle,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHere is the brutal and painful truth in a documentary format. The horror and evil of 10/7 is documented and presented with respect to its victims, it's survivors and the communities involved and affected. It does not exploit the pain and horror suffered that day and the following days and it allows the ones that worked to recover, repair, rebuild, restore, etc., the space to share the evidence and their experience with carnage left behind. This documentary does not exploit the unimaginable pain and depravity experienced that day by so many humans of different religions, races, and countries of origin.",True
16,10,The Truth must be told,tjxkmsbx,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is important and should be seen by as many people as possible. It tells the story of the atrocities suffered by the victims, everything that much of the world does not want to see or know.This is all the more important when you consider the courage it took for these people to testify.Not to watch this documentary is to deny what happened and to disrespect the victims. It is very moving and difficult to watch, but it should be watched by everyone. If you have a heart, you will not be able to remain insensitive to these testimonies. The truth must be told and must be heard for the victims.",True
17,10,Excellent treatment of a horrendous set of events,arenmaeir,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA shaking coverage of the horrendous acts of sexual violence conducted by HAMAS terrorists against Israeli women on October 7th, 2023. This is very important , as despite visual evidence by the terrorists themselves, forensic evidence of the victims (those alive who survived) as well as those murdered, testimonies of the victims, and of eye witnesses, as well as taped confessions by some of the terrorists themselves, which would suffice as clear legal proof for these horrific crimes, supporters of the the terrorists deny that these atrocities occurred! Thus, the accounts and descriptions, by the victims, in the movie, give important evidence and context for these heinous acts!Should be viewed by all!",True
18,10,Remarkable documentary incredibly powerful,starinskyshani,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat an important and delicately done film on such a heartbreaking and painful attack. Sheryl did an amazing and careful job bringing light to this horrible use of rape as a weapon of war and the importance of believing victims and survivors. This film cuts through all of the noise and politics and opinions with facts, testimonials, and most importantly humanity. We must all remember each other's humanity and never fail to condemn rape and sexual abuse under any circumstances. The world mist know what women and men alike endured and still are by Hamas terrorists, and speak up!!! A must watch!!",True
19,10,Must be seen,deenaalyse,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPowerful, heartbreaking, shock and horror are words that comes to mind after watching this film. It is such a horrific event that happened and this film was produced with so much grace for all the victims and survivors and heros. Everyone walking in this planet should see this film to witness the atrocious that happened on October 7th. Believe every women should not just be a blank statement, it should be a way of thinking when it comes to abuse, and this film proves that message. Sheryl Sandberg and Anat Stalinsky, thank you for making this film to allow the world to witness what Israel, and all those innocent people went through on that horrible day.",True
20,10,Must watch,vwfvwnb,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSheryl did an amazing job interviewing and amplifying the voices of the survivors of the Nova Festival, hostages released in the exchange in November, and the first responders including ZAKA and the amazing work they do.This is heartbreaking and difficult content to discuss but the truth must be told no matter how horrible it may be, regardless of the narrative being pushed by media because we unfortunately live in a time where antisemitism is being allowed, and even promoted.The cinematography was very well done and the fear, terror, and empathy throughout is palpable. Everyone in this film is incredibly brave and everyone should watch!",True
21,10,The truth as it happened. Must watch,id_cohen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt may be painful to witness but it is the truth. It is history as it happened and this must be watched by everyone. This isn't clickbait headlines. This is truth. If you have questions, the answers are here. If you have been silent, this will inform why you must speak. Watching this will break your heart but everyone lost that horrific day deserves your attention. Watch it. Watch it with your family. Watch it with your friends. Discuss. Ask questions. People are suffering on both sides of a war created from hate and hostages, including babies are still being held in tunnels. Watch their story.",True
22,10,Important and compelling,nikabareket,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA must watch. Truth will out! This documentary is an important historical documentation of what happened to hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians and women. The truth is irrefutable. Our societies have worked so hard to condemn violence against women and sexual violence in particular that we need to work hard to not lose ground in this important area of social responsibility and humanitarianism. Sandburg used her amazing skills and talents here as well as her experience with womens advocacy to tell the horrific story of what really happened that day. You owe it to yourself, your kids and your grandkids, as well as to history, to watch this important film!",True
23,10,Important and shocking!!!,brandon-978-905687,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerIt's hard to write a critique about a documentary like this. There were moments when viewing that I had to pause and reflect. Truly a beautiful film with heart wrenching stories. I can't think of a more important documentary for people to see. The horror and the pain felt by these people cannot and shall not be ignored. My wife and I cried many times while watching and we pray the people behind these events are brought to justice so that the people affected like this can have some from of peace. The people responsible will have plenty to answer to after this short life comes to an end. Share. This. Movie.,True
24,10,Simultaneously compelling and challenging,juliameyerowitzkatz,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary interviews survivors, witnesses and first responders about the October 7th 2023 Hamas attack in Israel. It highlights reported sexual violence cases during the incident. Factual accounts are presented without opinions and as such are powerful representations of harrowing experiences that no-one should ever have to endure. Simultaneously compelling and challenging viewing, the documentary's honesty and unsentimental representation of extreme sexual violence used as a weapon of war is testament to the bravery and resilience of the survivors, witnesses, and first responders, as well as to the courage of the filmmakers. It takes courage to bear witness to horrorific sexual violence.",True
25,10,NEVER FORGET,chapita-97935,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's a very important documentary to watch about the rape and mutilation of Israeli women on Oct. 7. The personal testimonies of victims, survivors and witnesses are clear and overpowering.The stories reveal atrocities that led one voice to describe them as ""redefined evil.""Sexual violence is the film's focus. The Hamas targets endured mutilation and rape before death. The details are almost unimaginable.Just when you think you've heard too much, that nothing could be as harrowing as the last testimonial, another shocking account arrives.Screams before silence must be seen and remember.",True

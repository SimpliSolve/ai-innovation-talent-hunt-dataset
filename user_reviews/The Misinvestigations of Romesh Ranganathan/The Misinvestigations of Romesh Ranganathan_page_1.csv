1,8,"Easy watching, respectful and funny",smartcaruk-29712,n/a,16/08/2025,"Romesh is always ace. Whether it involves shouting aubergines at him on stage or investigative journalism with a side order of comedy, you can be sure to be entertained. He sheds light onto such dark and serious subjects. New light though?, maybe not, but that doesn't matter. He's stuck to the facts, added some hearsay and brought a respectful light heartedness. Some of the things I learned where really quite shocking and unbeknownst to me. Happily, this is not the sort of series that Rob Beckett will highjack with his toothy wide grin always in the background. Enjoy the series I did, but then, I dont have an online boiled brain so i'm able to think freely, critically and therefore enjoy the series for what it is. It would be a shame not to!",False
2,1,Romesh was a great until he became a stooge for the elite by doing this series,neilwork,n/a,16/08/2025,"Romesh's humour is brilliant until he did this, everything until now has been gold but this series was basically a mockery of people who stood for something, most likely killed off by the establishment, so that you essentially think they can't have been murdered. He absolutely takes the piss out of genius talent so that if you haven't got critical thinking, you'll be fooled into thinking murder like this doesn't happen unless it's the Russians...yeah right, it's like a magic trick where they point in a direction to mis-direct you from the real illusion. People are stupid and easily fooled but Romesh acts the real fool here...a full blown traitor to human beings...and I'm sure anyone that questions this bs series will be ridiculed by the likes of him because that's what he does. I have zero interest in Jimmy Hendrix but it's funny how any threat is killed off...",False
3,8,Doesn't Quite Go Far Enough For Jimi And Nancy,cantrelayne,n/a,16/08/2025,"Overall I like Romesh Ranganathan. I've watched all his series. I know this is supposed to be a deadpan comedic look at 3 murders, however, sometimes it feels as though it has been long forgotten that these were murdered Human Beings. The only case that was looked at in a more compassionate way was Tu Pac, and it's obvious because Romesh was a fan. That said I do believe Romesh is sincere in the other two cases as well, it just seems a little disconnected compared to the Tu Pac case.He does miss key evidence in Jimi Hendrix's case because he does not include that Michael Jeffery confessed in detail of murdering Jimi Hendrix by pouring red wine down Jimi's throat until he drown for Jimi's life insurance. There were two other people holding Jimi down. Michael Jeffery was also caught by Noel Redding stealing the band's money and it was proven he had offshore accounts where he was siphoning off Jimi's income. A roadie for the Animals (another band Jeffery managed) says it isn't true, however the roadie wasn't there. Jeffery died in a plane crash 3 years later.In Nancy Spungen's case Romesh doesn't go far enough. The money that was stolen was a Recording Advance for Sid in the amount of $25K, not the $1500 he states. There were 20 people in and out of the room in the 12 hours prior to her murder. He doesn't consider that when Sid told the police he ""went to get HER methadone"", as the document he shows says, Sid may not have been there when the murder happened. Nancy may have been alive and asked him to get the methadone. Romesh also does not go into the fact that Sid's own mother put heroin in John Simone Ritchie's (Sid) food when he was growing up long before he met Nancy. Plenty of people growing up with Sid witnessed this, his mother was a hardcore junkie. His mother, ten years after Sid's death confessed she killed him with a hot shot because she did not want him to go back to jail, and then she took her own life on his grave.Nancy was born having to have an entire blood transfusion because of ABO Incompatibilities (RH factor) and her physical problems may have caused her mental ones. Her family did everything they possibly could to get her help from the time she was born until the day she died, and she was only 20 years old when she died. The medical system failed her and her family.I think Romesh Ranganathan is great. He does include sincerity in these three episodes, and there are some comedic bits thrown in. It would have been better to include more important information, and whilst comedy can be a way of dealing with murder, it can be crass, especially if these are people you do not know. That said it is good that he did these three cases because as time goes on people are forgotten, even famous people.",False

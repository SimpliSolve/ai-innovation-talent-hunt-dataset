1,3,Promising Trailer but disappointing documentary,flower-12585,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm originally from Germany but I have been moving between Europe and the USA in the past 20+ years. Climate change is one of the biggest topic in Germany so I was excited to see that it finally became an agenda in the USA ...The movie talks about the Sunrise movement and the New Green Deal which would eliminate fossil fuel and it also puts a big emphasis on having affordable housing, good paying jobs, free education etc. Especially for minorities. While these things are important (for everyone!), they are not related to climate change. Doing things for the climate will be uncomfortable for most people. It will be more expensive, it will require more effort. To me the climate change felt being buried under all these extra demands. How many people would still root for the climate change if it wouldn't be for all the other things?Also there weren't many ideas. There was talk about using wind/solar energy and employing people in these sectors and building energy efficient housing and this was pretty much it. There was zero talk about the pollution in the ocean, about recycling, about the enormous waste of plastic in the USA (plastic bags in Europe have been forbidden in supermarkets, same goes with plastic straws), extinction and threatening of animal species, how everything is connected and the whole eco system.At the end people get money if they have an electrical car but oil can still being drilled in the ocean? Are there any extra areas that are being protected? What is with the development of green spaces?Also seeing the policy maker using an aversive tool on her dog didn't leave the best impression. Animal rights and protection is another big topic politicians don't talk much about in the USA.Overall it was disappointing.",False
2,1,Someone make it stop...Please..,aarindamtalukdar,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just terrible, to be on the kinder side. It's like a purchased msm pushing a paid-for propaganda, regardless of its absurdity. As flimsy as a tik tok video, rather than a trustworthy factual cine document. When one pushes his luck too hard, banking everything on the current political polarization without actually presenting anything worthy or of value, only then you do get something as pathetic as this self-proclaimed 'documentary'. Seems like a failed effort at reenacting Wag the Dog in real life by the current ruling dispensation, trying to authenticate without evidence. Wasted money, wasted time.PS Don't go if you are scared of the dark, because you would be all alone.",False
3,1,Numerous inaccuracies and misleading statistics,waeracor,n/a,15/08/2025,"Climate change is an existential threat and we do not need to muddy the waters with misleading statistics, inaccuracies, and hyperbole to convince people of these facts! If we want the movement to be taken seriously, we need to consider realistic approaches like nuclear, advanced technologies such as new ways of fission/fusion, and transitionary fossil fuels like natural gas that replaced oil and coal while we advance our renewables and nuclear outputs... None of these were considered by ""To The End,"" which was a derivatives snooze fest with an abundance of criticism and a complete lack of practical solutions.",False
4,1,Soapbox Opera meets Political Pontification,inactivekick-76609,n/a,15/08/2025,"What do you get when you add a politician with a penchant for camera opportunism and political stunts? You get a forsaken sorry montage of done to death, political diatribe with lashings of pseudo-activism.What makes this instant meme a true failure though is its complete lack of scientific exploration, discourse and objective exposition, i.e. Showing alternate sides, views and scientific theory from both sides of the scientific and political spectrum.Political grandstanding in the guise of a documentary examining a complex environmental, socio-political and economic subject requires intelligent, lucid, in depth examination of a subject from differing perspectives - not just cheerleaders for a single, world p.o.vIf you sat through this (wait for it) ... to the End, you obviously have an extremely high pain tolerance.",False
5,7,An interesting look at contemporary activism.,goodellaa,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you remember the events in this documentary very well it will illustrate a time line of contemporary history, from a particular side of serious controversy. Serious because there is a lot of money and government control and major industrial concerns involved. If you don't remember it well, it could help direct you in researching what happened, and help you decide if you even care. The presentation is engaging, with many names and dates provided. The enthusiasm and frustration and moments of triumph of the young activists is exciting to observe. Sometimes we don't get all of the information that is wanted, like is that a hunger strike? I don't know. Who are the people causing an unlawful disturbance? Does anyone know that? I don't know if the opposition has a documentary like this to provide balance but wouldn't that be interesting as a double feature? You could do worse that to watch this documentary about people who intend to make a difference because they must.",False

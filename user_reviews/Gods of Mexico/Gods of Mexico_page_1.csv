1,10,Beautiful masterpiece,threenails10,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the pleasure of seeing this wonderful beautiful masterpiece on the big screen at an indie cinema in my city. The whole thing is a collage of landscapes, the people and workers, photographed with video. Every frame of this work was just beautifully done and you can feel some of the emotions from the people in these areas. It's well worth your time to see all the hard work that went into making this piece of art cinema. One of the best documentaries I've seen. Also, keep in mind this film is dialogue-less but the music, photography and feelings are all there and it's a great experience. Go and see this if you can.",False
2,10,Beautiful and artistic and zen,tucsoncraig,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredibly magical hypnotic photography and art exhibit for the soul. Culture and landscape across México is showcased in this fantastical dialogue-free journey that is unmatched by traditional documentaries with a focus on the ethnic diversity and the sounds of the environment. Moving snapshots in stark blacks, whites, and grays accentuate a sense of determination to reject the demands of modern society and embrace tradition. Each chapter fills the screen with a vast array of expressionless inhabitants of México as they invite you to an intimate peek into their eroding culture while still accessible. Truly a feast for the eyes and ears and spirit and soul.",False
3,3,"The parts of Mexico that you've never seen, minus the heart.",Sketchy19,n/a,16/08/2025,"The director said ""what if we take all the personality and color of Mexico away and replace it with a post apocalyptic monochrome serious tone with no personality"".The shots are beautiful. The sound is immersive. But WTF. There's no fun in Mexico according to this film. He told every person, just stand there and don't move or show any emotion and when you're working don't speak to anyone else.Not everything is a fiesta in Mexico but even in tough and hard times people there find a reason to celebrate life, to live it.I appreciate a foreign director taking an interest in the little seen parts of Mexico but why strip it of all its liveliness? If you've ever worked with Mexicans you know that we banter and play constantly even in tough jobs.I wish i could recommend this but it actually upset me how lifeless it all feels. Watch it for the cinematography but not for the feel and essence of Mexico.",False
4,5,Beautiful but frustrating,theemailofrichard,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film doesn't seem to know whether it is a documentary or a book of portraits. The portraits are stunningly beautiful and even artful, and the action sequences are likewise beautifully filmed. But as a documentary it leaves a significant amount to the imagination,'without dialogue or explanation. One can piece together what is generally happening but it's really your best guess. Really more a sequence of beautiful vignettes.Who are these people in masks? Are these traditional masks or the artistic conceits of the director? Is some
Of what we are seeing examples of real, day to day existence or are they more a historical recreation?I'm glad to have seen this film, but it left as many new questions as it answered!",False
5,4,I wishi had read the reviews first,yespat,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw the 7.0 score and decided to see this movie. I like documentaries and thought I'd be getting some understanding of the gods of Mexico. Nope, none of that here.This was one of the kinds of movies that could end at any point and the end feeling and understanding would be the same. I hate that type of movie. Basically there is no story and no point. I thought it was interesting in the closing credits that they gave someone credit for dialogue or script as there was no dialogue. No one said anything. One time it showed a man dancing to a tune on some kind of radio. Another time a coyote could be heard howling. There was zero instance of people talking.I'd say if you are interested in seeing a black and white photographic journey of unusual natural formations in Mexico, this is your film. Just don't expect to get any information about those formations, such as what most documentaries offer like, where this was, what the formation was, etc.",False

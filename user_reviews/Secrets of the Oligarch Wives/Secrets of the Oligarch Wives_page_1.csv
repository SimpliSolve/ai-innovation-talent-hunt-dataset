1,8,The simple TLDR on Russia,Pritchie45,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series is short but not dense introducing the concept of an Olgarchy and then delving deeply into the personal lives of a select few. Dictators and a select ruling class are common throughout history and there might be more informative documentaries but here you hear testimony by figures associated with Russia and Oligarchs. What makes this further interesting is the story told is act 1 of a three act story that hasn't unfolded yet with the war currently ongoing and the aftermath to the war having limitless possibilities.The people involved in this narrative have unimaginable wealth and the size of their homeland is likewise in area but like Russia itself it is devoid of growth and life. It was refreshing to be reminded that behind the curtain is a man who has more men behind him and that they have wives and children.There are no secrets revealed nor is the documentary groundbreaking but you get a perspective rarely seen, a political system that is historically common but alien to the vast population, and how little changes on a generational timescale. Russia won't change in a generation but if the powerful and the leaders don't change as well then a country would be steadfast for multiple generations. The stories here can be reflected to all countries but if we treat a president as a father who has to be man of the house for decades until his children grow up rather than a teacher who is constantly replaced then you end up stuck and in ruin, spreading ruin to those around you.The only issues I have is that you don't get a resolution on the main man Sergei. You get told these Oligarch became wealthy business men but the process, if any, that gave them a head start isn't explored. You understand Putin's appeal to his citizens but we never get their point of view of the facts surrounding the coincidental deaths of Putin's enemies. The most pressing mystery was what leverage did the Oligarchs think they had over Putin since he was able to go against them so easily, how exactly were they a threat to Putin's predecessor and to Putin himself. Since this was under 90 minutes I'll forgive the unanswered queries since I have an opportunity to figure them out myself with the context provided in this documentary.",False
2,10,The Russian Jungle,jandcmcq,n/a,16/08/2025,"Firstly I cannot believe that ANY-ONE could give this well researched and produced documentary one point UNLESS they are a Russian saboteur and from the unusual displacement of user ratings this seems to be the case - which is also in character shown by the production of those that rule Russia at this time - LIE, CHEAT, STEAL and MURDER.This documentary filled in many gaps for me just how power was distributed or should I say grabbed when the Soviet Union collapsed and how just one psychopath can convert the power of money over a nation to that of force. By that I mean the control of police, the military and a subservient hit squad more in keeping with the Mafia than an elected government. This is backed up by control of the media creating the right type of propaganda and a team of hand picked well rewarded collaborators. And keeping it running is simple - if you grouse you die.Well done to all those brave participants who now literally risk their lives for contributing to the production particularly Alexandra Tolstoy, Tatiana Fokina and her partner and financier Bill Bowder for his enlightening description of how business is done in Russia.This is a must see documentary for any-one interested in world order and how some-one can still rule a country like the medieval kings of England. Totally ignore the rigged rating. It is really in the 8 to 10 mark.I am confident that fear and corruption cannot win in the end but my concern in watching the documentary is how ingrained Putin's organization is and that even if Zelensky brings Putin down, in the short term the King Cobra in the Russian jungle will be replaced by a bigger one.",False
3,n/a,more American BS,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTypical American propagandeering BS. Take a look at yourselves first, but always quick to point the finger. Just look at Trumps time, what he's left and the amount of corruption then and coming out now. Not saying Russia isn't also a steaming pile, but basing anything of truth on the opinions gold digging wives of rich men....great factual movie making(sarcasm). Again, typical of America.No, I'm not Russian or any anti America person either, just facts is all I've stated, not opinion either as it has ALL been proven time and time again.",True

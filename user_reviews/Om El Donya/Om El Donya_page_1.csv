3,10,The type of documentary you watch twice,higgsharper,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sawsan Badr told the story of Egypt from prehistoric period till the Roman conquest. It's done beautifully with high level of accuracy. I love how they humanised these historic figures and analysed their motives and decisions. It was a beautiful and continuous journey, but it's hard to gather all the details and information without visiting this documentary for a second time. As far as I know it's only streaming on a local platform for now. I really hope they consider streaming this globally for free. People around the world are hungry for rich, Egyptian-made documentaries about this civilisation.",False
4,10,Absolutely incredible!,amorselim,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the time you start S1, episode 1, you will get hooked up and will binge.As an Egyptian and a history enthusiast I find this show one of the best and most accurate documentaries that speak about the history of Egypt, with a focus on the ""human"" and ""values"".I found myself learning new things every 3 to 8 minutes and drawing parallel lines to the current Egyptian dialect, culture and habits as well as many religions.You will get multiple ""Eureka"" moments while watching! You will pause and rush to the kitchen to share them with family members!The show is a new type of drama/documentary that keeps the historical accuracy of the information but is presented in a dramatic, logical and enjoyable way that is softer than traditional documentaries.It answers so many questions like: Are the current Egyptians the same as their ancestors?And
How (or if) that ancient civilization of Egypt disappeared.A must watch.",False

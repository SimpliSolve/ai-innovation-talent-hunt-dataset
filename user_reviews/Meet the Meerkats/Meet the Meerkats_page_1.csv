1,6,Hopeful it'll get better,real-64029,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a Meerkat Manor fan so decided to check this one out. While it is entertaining, it's not as interesting as Manor and then I figured out why - the meerkats so far, aren't identified by names - just position (e.g. Alpha Male/Female, Single Female).This is big mistake. The names allow you to identify them individually and feel more connected to their struggles. So far I don't feel anything one way or another about them individually or as a pact. No chance for a tearful moment like when Flower from Manor died since I don't feel connected.I've only seen 1 episode so hopefully it'll get better. Otherwise it's just another animal documentary (and I love the genre) but without emotional attachment.",False
2,10,I LOVE This Show!,saysjenn,n/a,16/08/2025,I casually put this on thinking I would tune out but it was so good. I heard about Meerkats but never watched shows like Meerkat Manor. I loved this show so much that I went back and binge watched all four seasons and of MeerKat Manor! I just wish Meet the Meerkats was more than five episodes. I'm hoping it was just a test run and next season will have more to watch! They really are fascinating to watch!!,False
3,10,All you want from a wildlife series,PotatoSkit,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a nerd watching wildlife shows for as long as I can remember, getting invested in this meerkats will be both a great thing but will truly test your ""feels"". One of the best ones I've seen, I never even heard of meerkats but this show introducing me to this amazing Creatures, I am grateful for. Just go and watch it, I rarely ever review anything but this show has brought me so much joy that well when you watch it you'll know what I mean. Well done discovery +",False
4,3,Narration ruins it,shelleyalevin,n/a,16/08/2025,"The narrator's delivery is flat and boring. There are such great examples of effective nature show narration out there, ranging from serious to funny. This one a huge fail.",False

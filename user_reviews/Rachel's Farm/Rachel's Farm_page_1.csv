1,9,Intro to Regeneration Farming 101,Phil_M_A_Kerr,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't have any substantial experience at all in growing my own food, let alone for any market. Now I have a basic grasp of the science behind healthy soil. I also have an appreciation of the weighty personal commitment required to have any measurable success at sustainable farming. There's no shying away from the initial financial toll here, either. The seemingly repetitive, mundane nature of much of the transformative work is, I suspect, evidence of the discipline required for the task at hand.Obviously Rachel Ward is relaxed in front of a camera but the other key subjects are also engaging. I'm referring to both humans and animals in this regard.The scenery is cinematic and seeing a doco on current and local issues on my neighbourhood cinema screen added much to the good experience.",False
2,8,'Comprehend and copy nature' Viktor Schauberger,kzvkzy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Viktor Schauberger (known as the water wizard)
demonstrated 100 years ago how to tend to the soil.& warned of the destructive practices that we are unfortunately only just now appreciating.How to plough in a special way , so as not to destroy the life giving micro structure within, that is responsible for keeping the soil healthy & able to produce bountiful produce.This is also shown in the film.Additionally Viktor manufactured a special plough which turned the soil so as not to destroy it's structure.Not only that but to avoid iron which has a deleterious effect on soil organisms. The ploughs he made were made of copper which also cut through the earth with ease , and whose trace elements are very beneficial micro-organisms.",False
3,10,An honest journey,b4blue,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerRachel is a great example of a person that tries not to be guided by ideology. She is open and always wants to learn. The child in her pushes her curiosity and an adult finds pathways forward. When the problem with her farm became difficult to ignore, she decides to give it full attention, because that was the only way to solve it. It was really amazing for me to hear her neighbour explain ""conventional"" farming practices, when he should have known that he was probably the first generation to fully apply them. To his father it was probably a new thing. Such stubbornness is expected. To accept teh needed change would be to devalue all of his life work, which was to degrade the soil he depends on. How can someone keep doing the same thing for decades and not realise the activity-damage connection? Well, we all do it. Experts said so, so it must be true. There is a certain feeling of safety in not taking responsibility for your actions and listening to a ""higher authority"". This is the new green revolution and I'm really happy so many people are creating documentaries about it. People need to know this and wake up. To move forward is to go back. We need new technologies but without the old ones, we are doomed.",True

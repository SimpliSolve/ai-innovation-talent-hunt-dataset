1,10,Great documentary!,lukeahulme,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary does a brilliant job at showing the grittiness and heroism of the Great War. While the ad breaks did get annoying after a while, the double movie documentary shows how bad warfare was for the men who served. But it also shows the bravery of African American men who were considered second class, and how these strong men overcame the hate of their own people, and became some of the most well known and respected soldiers in the battlefields of world war 1. Fair warning, the gritty images in the films show the darkness of war and the terror that loomed over the allies soldiers, including gas attacks, trench raids, and the wounded crying out for help. But all in all, 10/10!!",True
2,9,"Really good, but could have been better",cj71378,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finding superior documentaries on WWI made in the states it tough.This one has historians that are very knowledgeable (the user complaining about the Gettysburg death figure given by one, using that to denounce the whole documentary, that is the official number, though surely under counted given there were so many MIAs) with a few being considered tops in the field. The historical recreations aren't always the best with things like uniforms being occasionally wrong, but for most, that will be trivial. As far as giving average Americans a look at the war, it's very entertaining and informative.",False
3,5,Could have been so much better,mhorg2018,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was an OK documentary that should have been so much more. First, it's schizophrenic in a way; it wants to tell of the US participation in WW1 (aka The Great War, The War to End all Wars-sadly untrue) and it also want's to talk about the black soldiers Pershing gave to the French and how they, like all black soldiers who have served a mostly ungrateful country since the Revolution, performed heroically. It also has way, way too many commercial breaks for the viewer to remain interested. What History channel should have done was two documentaries; one about the US entry and fighting during this war, the second about the black soldiers who, in their own country were treated as second class citizens and, when in France (and in Britain during WW2) were treated as equals. This freedom let many see the world differently and many black soldiers remained in France rather than return to the Jim Crow south and Midwest and the uncaring for the most, north. So this was decent, but it missed being great because of these flaws. It attempted too much and accomplished too little.",True
4,1,Curious...,michaeladams-55198,n/a,16/08/2025,"If a historian in your show is saying ""at Gettysburg we lost maybe 7,000 troops..."" you should question whether you're using the best people.When something so ridiculously wrong makes it in the final product, what other falsehoods are being presented?The History Channel grows further and further from being historical every day. This level of professional scrutiny is what we expect from Netflix, perhaps I am expecting too much from the Aliens and Pawn Stars network.My review is too short but that's really my main gripe. After hearing the numbers given by that historian I kind of checked out. That's what happens when you don't bother to actually check what you present. People check out or get confidently misinformed.",False

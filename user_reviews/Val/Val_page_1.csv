1,9,Poignant,juliafrizzell,n/a,16/08/2025,"So touching. There's a lot to unpack in this documentary, and it's done so well. Especially if you're over forty, have gone through a divorce or possibly dealing with a chronic illness...shines a light of self reflection that so many of us can relate to. A reminder that regardless of fame and fortune, a man is still human and will undoubtedly experience the same collective gains and losses in this life that we all share; love, heartbreak, joy, grief, success, and failure. And inevitably, time.Val's journey is captivating and it's so beautiful to hear it told through his words and his son's voice. He really bares his soul and sometimes it made me cry other times I had to laugh..but through it all I felt compelled to admire a man, that in so many ways and in so many amazing roles, has quite literally been part of the soundtrack of my life... and for what's it worth, he'll always be my Huckleberry.Val, you're so loved. Thanks for letting your fans see the best part of you. Your heart.",False
2,8,unexpectedly touching,taytaytaylar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Went on a whim to see this movie expecting to learn a little about val kilmer... Was not expecting to feel so moved, heartbroken, inspired, & really just feel as emotional as i felt leaving the theater. A movie about acting , the creative process , overcoming the obstacles in front of us & continually moving forward despite of them. This movie really spoke to me ! Also loved that it was narrated by his son.",False
3,8,"Fascinating, very moving, informative and interesting personal view on Val Kilmer",Shadowboy_25cm,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary about Val Kilmer with the voice of his son Jack, because Val Kilmer had throat cancer, is considered cancer-free since 2017, but his voice suffered from ""extensive radiation and chemotherapy.""""Val"" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in July and is now available to watch on Amazon.What you know about Val Kilmer as an actor and a person always depends on how much you've studied him.I knew that Val Kilmer had his difficulties on some film shoots in the 90s with directors (e.g. John Frankenheimer - ""The island of Dr. Moreau"", Joel Schuhmacher - ""Batman Forever"") and some fellow actors, so it was difficult for him to find roles from the mid 90s and he appeared more and more in B-movies and indepentend films. Ok.The documentary is told from his point of view and we learn quite a bit about his childhood, his family, his acting beginnings, his career highlights and his present (anno documentary).With a running time of about 108 minutes, a rather quiet, prudent narrative reveals a man who does not necessarily reflect everything as it was at the time, but reflects on the stations of his life at that time and shows us more the current Val Kilmer and in rare footage the Val Kilmer of that time. As for disputes with fellow actors, Val Kilmer is silent. That is also not the subject of the documentary, the gossip press can report on it. As far as problems with directors are concerned, I think they are only mentioned in one film, but that's not the topic either.Here an actor shows how he came to acting and what it means to him, in a retrospective with quiet tones. Sometimes it's hard to understand Val Kilmer himself when he's speaking, but it's the unpretentiousness here and there that makes this documentary work. Val Kilmer recorded an incredible amount of his life himself and the documentary shows very private footage of his childhood with his brothers, his parents and his acting, be it in his own home movies, applications for movies, his ""practicing"" lines from Hamlet, etc.Overall, fascinating, very moving, informative and very interesting, this (self-)portrait of an actor and artist who has a great sense of family and an incredibly wide range of acting.Recommended.",False
4,10,I set up an account just for this movie,dustinmscott,n/a,16/08/2025,"First, I am a Val Kilmer fan but had not expected to be as surprised and gratified as I am for this movie. Every actor gives a part of themselves to us as a gift, but the honest reflection and bravery to show the weaknesses which many people hide, makes this an amazing movie.I am shocked at some of the comments on other reviews; saddened and disheartened that people can watch (even if they did) someone take off their mask and be real, then respond with vileness and cruelty. This was the first time I have ever had the privilege of seeing someone deal with life after fame and call themselves out on the fear and self doubt which can go with living in the light of yesterday. Showing the real struggles, exhaustion, and misunderstanding of a life that could have been stolen by cancer, instead rekindled into faith. Thank you Val for showing me a piece of humanity I will cherish. It is brave and made me a better person for the glimpse.",False

Disgusting. I can't believe the people posting ""another millionaire who lost his money"" BS on here are anything other than total sociopaths. You should be ASHAMED and horrified.

7,6,An entertaining and elusive illusion,mikeburdick,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don't get me wrong, 'Val' is captivating and compelling viewing. Kilmer was, after all, one of Hollywood's top-dog actors of the late '80s, early '90s-and he basically filmed his entire life, which creates interest, authenticity and nostalgia. However, despite the film's main theme being about the ability of acting to create the illusion of truth, this documentary manages to steer clear of any honesty or meaningful revelations about its main character.The central question for anyone remotely aware of Kilmer is likely, 'What happened to that guy?' Largely because he was one of those actors who went from 0 to 100 overnight, from 'Top Secret' to 'Top Gun', from nobody to Jim Morrison. Then he disappeared just as fast.Through home videos and a one-man film crew-Kilmer himself, seemingly capturing every waking moment of his own life-we get to know this character's major plot points, yet oddly never really get close to the answers to our questions.The film seems to follow basically a chronological timeline of Kilmer's childhood, entry into acting and major film career, jumping out occasionally into his life today, dealing with a difficult medical condition. Again, it's compelling viewing. There's a brutal honesty and bravery involved in Kilmer allowing the world an uncomfortable glimpse into his post-surgery personal life.However, you begin to notice some glaring omissions, most notably a missing 20 years when his career slid off a cliff, begging the questions: What happened to his career? How did he go from A-list to C-list? What happened to his marriage?Despite the phenomenal home-shot footage and well-curated soundtrack, after a while, you begin to suspect that the actor might have left his most convincing and honest material on the cutting room floor, that perhaps not every tragedy that befell him was someone else's fault, and that the intent of the film was not in fact to document the truth, but to purposely obfuscate it.It's totally understandable that someone who has gone through tough times, made some mistakes and perhaps behaved less than admirably would want to gloss over those moments and flaws. However, there is no hero's journey without recognition and growth. So the end result is less of a compelling, insightful life story and more of a nostalgic memoir.",False
8,10,The Iceman Cometh!,claire-60940,n/a,16/08/2025,I've been a fan of this man for decades and you could feel the extent of his journey in the depth of the characters he portrayed. It was both beautiful and tragic to take a glimpse at the journey itself.,False
9,7,"""My name is Val and I've lived a magical life""",paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Val"" (2021 release; 109 min.) is a documentary about actor/Hollywood enfant terrible Val Kilmer. As the movie opens, Harry Nilsson's Everybody's Talkin' is playing while we get a tour of Val's house and he shows the endless boxes of home videos and other footage that he has amassed over the decades. He also mentions that throat cancer has left his voice badly impaired--and his son Jack is doing the voice over in most of the documentary--although today's Val is interviewed as well. We then go to ""How It All Began""... At this point we are 10 min. Into the documentary.Couple of comments: although nominally directed by Leo Scott and Ting Poo, this is Val Kilmer's movie all the way. He is credited as writer and producer, but the real star in all of this is the endless archive footage that Val amassed and which is used to provide a deeply intimate and personal look back at the life and times of the erstwhile Hollywood enfant terrible. Thankfully the documentary is chronological. The footage of Val at The Juilliard School is priceless (Kelly McGillis was a contemporary). Val is perhaps best known for his roles in ""The Doors"" and ""Batman Forever"", and both films get extra attention. But it's when you look at Val's overall body of work that you get a sense of the vast talents of this man. The documentary does a great job conveying this, but it's in the personal (family; film's behind the scenes) moments that the documentary really shines. Just watch Val comment on the impact of his brother Wesley's death at age 15, just when Val was about to start at Juilliard.""Val"" premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and had a brief theatrical run before then shifting to Amazon Prime, which is where I caught it. If you are a fan of Val Kilmer, or are simply interested in Hollywood, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (unlikely at this point), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",False
10,9,Still tearing up,ruthburley,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been missing Val Kilmer & didn't know why he'd been absent. Now, I'm heartbroken for his struggle, & I appreciate him so very much. Bless him & all he has brought to us as a stunning dedicated actor.",False
11,7,"Hollywood actors aren't always the most interesting people, but this guy is an obvious exception",fredrikgunerius,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fascinating look at the eventful life and peculiar character of actor Val Kilmer, an offbeat movie star of the 1990s. In this documentary by the filmmaking duo of Leo Scott and Ting Poo, Kilmer talks about everything from his battle with throat cancer, which has all but ended his acting career, to how he got into a career in the movie business, his marriage with actress Joanna Whalley, and being a father to his children Mercedes and Jack. The main reason why Val is such a rewarding and immersive watch is the vast amount of video footage shot by Kilmer during the course of his life, which is seamlessly merged into this tale by the filmmakers. Another reason is of course Kilmer's wonderfully optimistic take on life. Hollywood actors aren't always the most interesting people, but this guy is an obvious exception.",False

13,7,Fascinating but leaves you wanting more,Katz5,n/a,16/08/2025,"Video cameras with built-in mics entered the commercial market around 1981, right around the time a young, talented actor with Native American roots named Val Kilmer decided to become an actor - first on stage, and then on film, and then back to stage. Armed with several such video cameras, Kilmer and members of his family started shooting - resulting in boxes upon boxes of videotapes and 8 MM tapes that Kilmer still has. Following a brush with throat cancer and surgery that left him with an electronic voice box as his ""voice,"" the elder Kilmer, along with his son and daughter, set out to make this engrossing documentary, that celebrates the man, his survival, and his art and love of the arts (not just acting, but also music and painting).As entertaining, funny, sad, poignant as this nearly 2-hour documentary is, you are left wanting more. Maybe some interviews with his co-stars. Late in his acting career, Kilmer earned a reputation for being ""difficult,"" yet this documentary only touches on that. There are intriguing behind-the-scenes sequences shot during the making of the Island of Dr. Moreau, a movie that could have killed Kilmer's career, but thankfully did not (Ghost and the Darkness and The Saint were released after the notorious bomb that co-starred a nearly demented Marlon Brando).Watching the film, I had forgotten how many movies Kilmer appeared in. Much attention is given to Top Gun, of course, as well as The Doors (the actor confesses that he believed he was born to play Jim Morrison - and certainly had the physical similarities as a starting point). And The Island of Dr. Moreau is given a lot of attention as well, particularly one of apparently many arguments the actor had with director John Frankenheimer (one of which was captured on video and can be seen in this documentary). Who was the bigger problem on that movie set? Kilmer, or Frankenheimer? The viewers are left to decide for themselves. Personally I would have enjoyed seeing more about his relationship with Cher early in his career, and more about his marriage with Joanne Whaley, who seems to be an intensely private person as evidenced in this documentary (and was probably mostly left out of the film for that reason). Also Thunderheart, a movie that at the time of release meant a lot to Kilmer, is barely mentioned.But in the end we're left with a fairly optimistic documentary - despite his inability to talk, Kilmer claims he's pretty healthy overall and ""sounds worse than he feels."" But not being able to talk certainly hampers movie and stage careers - and Kilmer was set to bring his one-man show (written himself) as Mark Twain to Broadway when he was stricken with cancer. He throws himself into his new art studio and appears at Comic Con, gamely signing movie posters, Top Gun gear, and Batman toys for hours to support himself and his studio.Perhaps a BluRay of this documentary could include interviews with actors he worked with - certainly he could not have ""alienated"" all of them (which the tabloids hinted about years ago). Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Kelly McGillis, Elisabeth Shue, Kurt Russell, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Carrey, Robert DeNiro, and directors like Michael Mann, Ron Howard, Oliver Stone...so many possibilities.",False
14,5,First 30 minutes great then...,ddio_film2001,n/a,16/08/2025,"The trailer made this film look a hell of a lot better. For someone who had a warehouse of footage, I was thinking we'd see some great BTS moments or rare 80s Hollywood. And the first 30 minutes we do, but then the film slides into really weird monologues and just mundane events of a quirky actor. Sometimes we aren't the best person to tell our own story, this film proves that.",False
15,9,Very honest and touching,PFFAW,n/a,16/08/2025,"A friend of a friend was Val Kilmer's personal assistant back in the 90s. She loved working for him and had the nicest things to say about him. I was always a little skeptical, because of his reputation. But this film matches every great thing she said about him. Really lovely and thoughtful.

I am grateful I saw it in theaters and to see all of the interesting characters he developed, his work, his audition, life as an artist, Iceman in Top Gun, Jim Morrison in The Doors, are just 2 of my favorite movies and to see the behind the scenes from the man itself, there's no better feeling and learning experience like it.

22,6,Val,Prismark10,n/a,16/08/2025,"The success of Top Gun: Maverick has bought Val Kilmer in the spotlight as he reprises his role os Iceman for a touching cameo.The fact that the trailers of the movie featured a large photo of Iceman but no scenes of him indicated that Kilmer is still in bad shape after his throat cancer treatment.Val Kilmer has amassed thousands of hours of footage since he was a kid. Home movies and video recordings since childhood.Maybe Kilmer had no plans to release this documentary while he was alive. His deteriorating health has likely to have changed that.Val Kilmer had an interesting ascend to stardom. He attended Julliard, then after doing some theatre. He got a break with the comedy Top Secret! From the makers of Airplane.He had a supporting role in Top Gun, then starred in George Lucas's Willow. He made it big when Oliver Stone cast him as Jim Morrison in The Doors. He was memorable as Doc Holliday in Tombstone. In 1995 he replaced Michael Keaton as Batman in Batman Forever. Later he joined Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Heat.However by the mid 90s Kilmer also acquired a reputation of being a jerk and difficult to work with. With several flops, the 21st Century offered little in memorable movie roles. The most significant roles he has was a gay detective in Kiss Kiss bang Bang.The home movie footage of the Kilmer family gives this documentary as different spin. As Kilmer gets older and attends drama school, goes to auditions and make self tapes gives a picture of a genesis of an actor.As Kilmer's voice has been affected by throat cancer. The documentary is narrated by his son. When Val Kilmer speaks, it is difficult to understand him.Before his cancer diagnosis, he played Mark Twain in a one man stage production that became popular.Nowadays Val Kilmer can make money in the convention circuit signing autographs. It helps that he did movies such as Top Gun, The Saint, Heat, Batman Forever, Tombstone. Iceman has become an iconic character.However attending convention is not easy money. His health means that Kilmer is fragile, there is a scene where he throws up in a bin at a convention.I would had liked to have seen more regarding his tantrums in movies such as The Island of Doctor Moreau. He got the first director fired, did not get on well with the replacement. He was regarded as being casually cruel to crew members. He had the chance to work with his idol Marlon Brando, but he usually sent his double to the set.It was still fascinating to see Kilmer's approach to acting, his family life even though his split from Joanne Whalley was also glossed over.",False

As a fan, I felt privileged to be let into his homes and special relationships with friends and family alike. I don't think you have to be a Val fan to appreciate this work and/or be moved by it. With all of the footage over the years, I can't help but wonder what an extended version would look like? Count me in.Wesley would've been amazed and so proud. Keep going Val!",False
24,7,"Good, Heartfelt Documentary",gwnightscream,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis 2021 documentary chronicles the life & career of actor, Val Kilmer from his childhood to the present.We get to see tons of behind the scenes & home footage via camcorder shot by him. His 2 kids, Jack and

bad for him because he's had a lot of obstacles in his life like divorce, losing family members and cancer.He still attends signings and such, but it's also a shame that he didn't get many of the roles he wanted.I highly recommend this good, heartfelt documentary.",True
25,4,Photo Album,Cineanalyst,n/a,16/08/2025,"I suppose as much is to be expected given that Val Kilmer is the producer of his life story here, as well as providing the numerous hours of camcorder footage over the years from which it was edited, that ""Val"" is overly hagiographical and superficial. It's like someone narrating their autobiography, detailing family trips and such, to you as you politely flip through their photo album or watch their home videos, or the equivalent of liking someone's pics or vids on their Facebook page, or Instagram, or whatever the platform for photographic narcissism is these days. Considering the portrait here is of a good actor with a notorious reputation for being ""difficult,"" I was hoping for more than that.Instead, we get a lot of childhood backstory and the highlights of his career rise, from ""Top Gun"" (1986), ""Tombstone"" (1993) and ""Batman Forever"" (1995), to the ill-fated ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" (1996), then skipping through a bunch else, to his one-man Mark Twain stand-up comedian play, before Kilmer's acting career was entirely derailed by throat cancer taking his voice (consequently, his son provides much of the narration here). I would've liked more insight into his acting approach than, say, him remarking on how poor the script of ""Top Gun"" was, but how it was saved by Tony Scott's direction, or how he's so good in ""Tombstone"" because the script was so good. And, Kilmer building up Marlon Brando as his hero to, then, have the only footage of them working together on ""Dr. Moreau"" being Brando ignoring him aside from demanding a push as he lies in a hammock was awkward.The ""difficult"" label that he received is also glossed over, with the exception of some video of him arguing with ""Dr. Moreau"" director John Frankenheimer over the director threatening to quit and Kilmer refusing to turn off the video camera. We also learn how awful it was to star as Batman, with a suit that severely limited his ability to act--or even hear. Probably little wonder, then, that Kilmer and Joel Schumacher didn't get along, either.Otherwise, we mostly learn how rough life can be, I guess, especially when smoking causes cancer. Although, as in the spirit of the rest of the documentary, smoking isn't mentioned here, either. Indeed, one could probably learn more about Kilmer, including from Kilmer himself, by reading his interviews elsewhere or books. He gave a quality and concise response to the ""difficult"" label in a Reddit thread once, for instance. The best part of ""Val"" is probably the camcorder footage, which provides new material and a picture of much of his life, but even this is undermined by much of the focus being on present Kilmer, voice box an' all, as he shows what he's up to these days. And, even there, one may get the sense that we're not getting a full or honest picture. This includes his health, as we're told he feels better than he looks, but then we see him vomiting and feeling faint signing autographs at a comic con. Then, later, he only pretends to be faint. If anything, I suppose I learned that Kilmer has quite a sense of humor.",False

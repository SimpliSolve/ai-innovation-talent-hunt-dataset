1,9,Not often that a film truly entertains as well as informs...,0w0,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sometimes, a film of this type makes a real impact... just sometimes... But, it very often doesn't have any impact at all like in the case of movies like Dark Waters (Dupont) or Deepwater Horizon (BP) or Love & Other Drugs (Pfizer/Eli Lilly) or The Big Short (Banks) or Thank You For Smoking (Tobacco)... I'd like to think that this film had at least a measurable impact on society and more specifically, the amount of sexual abuse cases in religion... and that in itself, is commendable.The film does a good job not only focusing on the main cast of characters, but also spends some time focusing on the sub-supporting characters, like the 'survivors' in the film and spends a good amount of time on the investigative part of the whole story as well... journalism like this didn't just fall out of the sky... it took months and months of hard researching and interviewing many many different people...They obviously took some creative license wrt. the events and timeline of certain parts of the film, but overall about 90% of the events shown in the film actually happened. And overall it's a good film and a fantastic docu-movie that should be viewed by all at least once.",False
2,9,"A powerful, hard to watch film.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"The real life story of how The Boston Globe did the unthinkable, and exposed the huge cover up, The Catholic church trying to bury the numerous cases of child molestation among The Boston Archdiocese.This is such a powerful, thought provoking movie, often difficult to watch, some of the content is truly sickening, but a very well made film, very well acted, the truth of how a story that needed to be told, came out, despite the efforts of many establishments to keep it suppressed.It's not often a film makes me feel angry, Spotlight certainly did that.Superbly acted by all involved, Stanley Tucci, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and of course Michael Keaton.There was one scene in particular that stood out, having spoken to The Priest who openly admitted to child abuse, Sacha looks down the road, and hears the innocent sound of children playing, that sent a chill down my spine.That closing sequences were chilling, cover ups across the world.9/10.",False
3,8,Spotlight,m-91886,n/a,15/08/2025,"The whole movie is like a good news report itself. It tells the story, introduces people, looks for evidence and solves difficulties. Calm and clear, it is said that it is also very appropriate for the real office and living environment of journalists. Of course, in order to maintain this tone, the story of the news itself has been weakened, and the character of the reporter itself can not be deeply shaped.",False
4,10,It will leave you shaken....,planktonrules,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before you consider watching ""Spotlight"", I STRONGLY urge you to think twice. It isn't because I think it's a bad film--it's amazingly good. But it's also a difficult film to watch--particularly if you or someone close to you has been a victim of sexual abuse. I know that in my case, it was particularly tough because I am a retired psychotherapist and used to specialize in working with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators...the latter, which, I think benefit very little from treatment (which is much of the reasons I changed careers).The story is about not only the discovery of a huge number of pedophile priests in the Boston parish by Boston Globe reporters but the organization's discovery that the problem went all the way to the top. In other words, even the beloved Cardinal Bernard Law KNEW about the many, many victims and yet did nothing to discipline them or restrict their access to more victims. But the film doesn't just talk about so much that we know to be true today but it covers the stop by step process by which the paper began and completed the investigation.Why did I give the film a 10...particularly since I almost never give films such high scores? Well, the reason is that the folks making the movie really, really cared about the subject matter and getting it right. Instead of focusing on making money with the film and including the usual glitz and glamour, the filmmakers chose instead to emphasize realism above all else. Normal looking actors (such as Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo) are used...and they make efforts to keep them normal looking. Additionally, the film has a relatively slow and deliberate pace--again as they weren't interested in making a pretty or Hollywoodizing the production. Overall, a great film made greater because the folks making it really, really seemed to care and wanted to get it right...which showed great sensitivity for the subject matter and the victims. Great film!",False
5,n/a,"Engagingly told story of process, with a strong emotional core",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"By coincidence I watched this film only a week after listening to the editor in chief of Huffington Post UK say that authentic writing cannot come from paid journalists, which is why they do not pay their writers (although Adriana Huffington seemed fine with the millions she got when she sold the website). This stuck in my mind when watching this very fine drama about how the Boston Globe reporters uncovered and exposed a mass cover-up of abuse within the Catholic Church. Also in my mind was a sense of disbelief that this true story is not too much more than a decade old – the mass abuse of children by Catholic Priests now just seems such a known thing now that it is hard to imagine a time when it wasn't.Perhaps because this is so well known, the film is compelling because it focuses on the story of the story, focusing on the journalism. This gives the film the challenge that in terms of action it is mostly people typing, people on the phone, and lots of talking. This it manages really well, building a compelling but robust drama that builds well and takes the viewer along with it. The subject matter means that the emotional side is not left behind either, and the film deftly reminds us of the people (not just the facts) in ways that are natural and integrated, not sentimental or manipulative.McCarthy directs with professional control, and standards are high – mostly noticeably in the casting. It is not easy to point out one lead, because so many famous faces are here, and all of them do their job in a way that integrates with the rest – there are no really showing moments, no moments where you feel someone is pushing for an Oscar; it is a real ensemble piece, with too many good turns to start to name them all. The end result is that strong writing, and respect for the process of journalism, combines with the importance of the true story and the strong delivery of all aspects to produce an engaging story which carries emotional and professional weight.",False
6,10,A movie that qualifies as strong meat a.k.a. be ready to digest a lot of reality and face the true face of a world unknown to people living in a happy bubble.,miriam-seraia,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie undid something inside of me. It's that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. ""Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, ""You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night."" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication of the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the cinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!",False
7,10,A heavy subject dealt with rivetingly,TheLittleSongbird,n/a,15/08/2025,"'Spotlight' to me was a very worthy Best Picture winner. Even if it didn't do much for me, which it did, it would still be appreciated for what it set out to do and would have been applauded for trying.It took on a very heavy subject, that is still very much relevant today, and does it in a way that's riveting with a strong emotional core, strong insight that illuminates and tells of stuff that we didn't know (that leaves us shocked and very angry) and not fall into the trap of having too much of things that we knew already. It also never feels mawkish or preachy, traps that it also could have fallen into.While it is a deliberate and relatively slow-paced film, it didn't leave me bored for a second, instead gluing me in with its excellent performances across the board, how it tells its story, it's beautifully balanced screenplay and sheer class. Tom McCarthy's direction has all the class and professionalism that 'Spotlight' needed.Other strengths are the way it's filmed, it's very atmospheric and evocative in its detail and the cinematography is gritty and ravishing. The music fits beautifully, 'Spotlight's' script and story are engrossing and quietly intelligent and the characters are written compellingly.Acting is excellent across the board. Both Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams give career-best performances worthy of award recognition, particularly Ruffalo. Michael Keaton's performances here and in the previous year's 'Birdman' are his best in years, a very commanding turn. Brian D'Arcy James are up to their level.Overall, a riveting and brave film that does wonders with a difficult subject matter. 10/10 Bethany Cox",False
8,10,It Could've Been You,trevorj-67694,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've rated almost a hundred movies and I've only ever given out six 10s on this website. I don't rave about many movies and I am tough to please when it comes to film, but this film is absolute brilliance. It is flawless. This one earns its 10 and it is one of the best films I have ever seen.Everything about this film is brilliant. The camera work is great and the score is underrated. However, what makes this film is an absolutely genius screenplay that is acted to perfection. This script will rock your world. I am not Catholic. I didn't grow up in a deeply Catholic area, but this film still affected me greatly. Everyone should see this movie for that reason. That is something that you have to see for yourself.However, I'd like to focus a little more on the technical aspects. Beyond the fact that the subject matter is heavy and extremely important to American and world culture, this movie does everything else right. The acting is absolutely phenomenal. This is particularly true for Ruffalo and McAdams. I adore the subtlety with which they both act. It is brilliant. There isn't much more to say. This film is pure brilliance from its opening frame to its closing moment. For both cinematic and cultural reasons, this is a film that every person should see.",False
9,7,Solid yet I think the subject matter was what got it nominated for Best Picture,AlsExGal,n/a,15/08/2025,"The opening is flat and not well paced. It came to life ten or fifteen minutes in with the first appearance of Billy Crudup as the trial lawyer Eric Macleish, who gave this film a much-needed jolt of energy.Fortunately, the film does build, and the more the story unfolds, the more gripping it becomes, and seemingly, Tom McCarthy's direction improves, too. The performances are all very good, the writing is solid, and the production design is admirable. I don't see Mark Ruffalo's work as Oscar-worthy, which is not to knock it. I thoroughly appreciate the way the performances are underplayed--a performance cannot be more underplayed than Liev Schreiber's, yet that seems right for a character who never shows his cards. It's easy to imagine an approach that has all the reporters emoting heavily as they come to realize the horror of the situation.Michael Keaton as Walter Robinson, John Slattery as Ben Bradlee, Billy Crudup as Macleish, Stanley Tucci as Garabidian, Jamey Sheridan as Sullivan, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law are all outstanding, as are others I'm probably forgetting to mention. The minor parts are cast with actors with faces who look like they belong in Boston, such as Rachel McAdams' grandmother or the woman who plays the priest's sister.The story is so compelling that I was very glad I had seen it, though a crispness of approach from the beginning, establishing characters from the get-go, would have made the movie even better.",False
10,10,Fantastic Movie Filled with Sadness,boatsfra,n/a,15/08/2025,"Going into the theater to see Spotlight, I had read the rave reviews and knew I was in for something special. This movie did not disappoint! Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life growing up, as a lot of ""what ifs"" came to mind. ""What if"" I went to church every Sunday...""what if"" I was gullible enough to have a priest lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims. The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told the rest of us ""...I am a survivor..."" WOW...",False
11,7,A fine film but not worthy of winning Best Picture,jtindahouse,n/a,15/08/2025,"Going into 'Spotlight' I was aware that it was the front runner to win Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. After having seen it I can't really understand why. That's not to say it wasn't a good film, it simply didn't blow me away at all. It told a story, an admittedly fascinating and true story, in an informative way but it didn't do anything that great films do like inspire me, move me or leave me stunned with the powerful nature it was told with. Best Picture winners of the past, like 'Schindler's List', told true stories but also encompassed all three of those traits and plenty more. That was a film I will never forget, 'Spotlight' will probably be completely out of my mind by this time next week. Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of emotion such a serious subject brought out in me. The film just didn't really seem to try to do that. It felt more like a documentary reenactment, simply with very fine actors, than anything else.My disagreement with it likely winning Best Picture aside, there are some very fine filmmaking skills on show here in all departments. Director Tom McCarthy, in only his fifth turn at directing, has been nominated for a Best Directing award. While I don't like the lack of emotion his storytelling brought out in me, he clearly had a vision to tell a story in a certain way, and he got it done. He tells it in a punchy fashion that never allows the audience to drift off. The Best Directing race this year is a tight one with four of the five all being widely in contention. I don't think McCarthy will get the win however, as his film doesn't have the ""X-Factor"" going for it that a lot of the others do. Having said that, any film that wins Best Picture has to get some real credit for its director, so don't completely rule him out if it does indeed win that.Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams have also been nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Actress awards. I have trouble understanding how, to again be frank. Roles based on real life characters always get more attention than others but these two had absolutely nothing to work with in the script. They were almost never given a chance to shine in any scene. Because of this I don't believe either has a chance of winning their respective award. It wasn't a film designed to make actors look good. Having said that, the stand out performance for me was Michael Keaton. He almost won the Best Actor award last year and this year can't even get a nomination. Had his been considered a Supporting Role I'm sure he would have but it was probably considered in that ""in between"" state, which may have hurt him.There are a lot of true stories at this year's Acadmey Awards and I think 'Spotlight' is benefiting from being the most interesting story of them all. 'The Big Short' is another case of an interesting true story, however that was told in a very unique and clever way. Interestingly, that is the biggest competition 'Spotlight' will have when the winner is read out on the night. My fingers might just be crossed on the seeing the upset.",False
12,10,#5 All-Time Greatest Film. 71 Awards. 💯,Instant_Palmer,n/a,15/08/2025,"Tom McCarthy's 'Spotlight' portrays the Boston Globe's investigative articles on the Catholic Church's cover-up of pedophile abuse by a significant percentage of its priests in the Boston area.The movie wastes no time in it's 2 hours and 9 minutes with on-the-edge-of-your-seat pacing. Every interaction is meaningful, every character believable, as layer after layer of the Catholic churches systemic cover-up is unfolded.Spotlight is the best newspaper movie ever produced, and #5 on my All-Time Greatest Films list - IT'S THAT GOOD!But the underlying relationships of the ""Spotlight"" investigative team that thrives as a proxy family is the element that makes this movie so appealing.Idealic respect shared between the characters and the professional bond that the diverse personalities have for each other is laid out by McCarthy over the course of the movie. Like close siblings whose love and common bond allow for overlooking each others idiosyncrasies and grow stronger under duress, the characters navigate the religious, social, community, political and legal challenges of bringing such an impacting story to press.'Spotlight' is flawless in execution. Every facet (writing, casting, acting, direction, cinematography, and editing), mixes together to yield 2015's Best Picture, and resides with 'There Will Be Blood' at the top of my list of best films since 2000, Ranks #5 All-Time, and is the ONLY film to ever make my ""Top 100 Greatest Films of All Time"" in its first year of release (moved up into Top 25 the next year and just became eligible (min. 5 years from release date) for my Top 5 List>

13,7,A well written biopic,beckegav,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA film that starts off average for the first half hour but turns into something very compelling. This biopic might not be for everyone since the subject matter can be pretty disturbing and uncomfortable. But it definitely made me feel something at the end of the movie.The interviews with the victims made you understood how bad this scandal really was and they never shy away from telling you how unsettling it was to have someone you trust do things that disturb you. For that I commend this movie. Mark Ruffalo gives the performance of his career. I also liked the small scene at the end with Rachel McAdams and her grandma reading the article toward the end.Some issues are the first 30 minutes before the plot really gets going. It felt inconsequential to the rest of the movie. Also some characters aren't as well developed as others, I didn't really care about anyone outside of the spotlight team.Overall I recommend this movie as long as you can handle the touchy subject matter",True
14,1,It was the Phoenix and not the Globe that broke this story,gmanandge-99575,n/a,15/08/2025,"The truth is that it's a well-known fact that Kristen Lombardi of the Boston Phoenix broke this story long before the cowardly editors at the Boston Globe finally ran their version. She, Lombardi, and the Phoenix did the dirty work and the Globe took the credit and is still taking the credit. The rumor, at the time, was that the Globe was bullied by the church into denying that any of the stories published by the Phoenix were true. The Globe became complicit in helping the church keep the story as quiet as possible. This movie is based on a gross misrepresentation of the facts and is being sold on television shows like 'Charlie Rose' as a monument to the Globe's courage and capability in investigative journalism.",False
15,10,Super film,mrshev,n/a,15/08/2025,"It won best film, deservedly so. This is a film that resonated with me long after I watched it. The complicated tale of the investigation of paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in riveting fashion by Tom Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a scene to anything less than the plot or character development. I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their portrayals.Keaton seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real shift. This felt like a documentary at times and I could feel the audience around me leaning forward as each new revelation is uttered.Just brilliant.",False
16,10,Priests Secretly Committing Pederasty. An Award Winner Reality Movie.,HealthyLove,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSpotlight is a 2015 American biographical drama film directed by Tom McCarthy and written by McCarthy and Josh Singer. The film follows The Boston Globe's ""Spotlight"" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States, and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. It is based on a series of stories by the real Spotlight Team that earned The Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The film stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup.Spotlight was shown in the Out of Competition section of the 72nd Venice International Film Festival. It was also shown at the Telluride Film Festival and the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released on November 6, 2015, by Open Road Films. It won numerous guilds and critics' association awards, and was named one of the finest films of 2015 by various publications. It is nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Film Editing, Best Supporting Actor: Mark Ruffalo, Best Supporting Actress: Rachel McAdams, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture.In 2001, The Boston Globe hires a new editor, Marty Baron. Baron meets Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, the editor of the Spotlight team, a small group of journalists writing investigative articles that take months to research and publish. After Baron reads a Globe column about a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, who says that Cardinal Law (the Archbishop of Boston) knew that the priest John Geoghan was sexually abusing children and did nothing to stop him, he urges the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist Michael Rezendes contacts Garabedian, who initially declines interview. Though he is told not to, Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team, persuading Garabedian to talk.Initially believing that they are following the story of one priest who was moved around several times, the Spotlight team begin to uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and an ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese. Through a man who heads a victim's rights organization, they widen their search to thirteen priests. They learn through an ex-priest who worked trying to rehabilitate pedophile priests that there should be approximately ninety abusive priests in Boston. Through their research, they develop a list of eighty-seven names, and begin to find their victims to back up their suspicions. When the September 11 attacks occur, the team is forced to deprioritize the story. They regain momentum when Rezendes learns from Garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm Cardinal Law was aware of the problem and ignored it. After The Boston Globe wins a case to have even more legal documents unsealed, the Spotlight Team finally begins to write the story, and plan to publish their findings in early 2002.As they are about to go to print, Robinson confesses to the team that he was sent a list of twenty pedophile priests in 1993 in a story he never followed up on. Baron, nevertheless, tells Robinson and the team that the work they are doing is important. The story goes to print with a link leading to the documents that expose Cardinal Law, and a phone number requesting victims of pedophile priests to come forward. The following morning, the Spotlight team is inundated with phone calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories. The film closes with a list of places in the United States and around the world where the Catholic Church has been involved in concealing abuse by priests.",True
17,9,Catholic Church in the Spotlight.,brendandevere,n/a,15/08/2025,"Relevant, powerful and astonishing. Shocking, criminal and true. These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the 'spotlight' on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These 'men of God' preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet. 'Spotlight's' dramatic importance has immediately drawn the attention of film lovers who crave a riveting production that dives deep into a very real circumstance that has impacted every corner of the globe.Tom McCarthy could not have been at the helm of a better film and what he has been able to achieve in terms of wrestling the attentions of the audience is worthy of the highest praise. McCarthy, along with Josh Singer have written a gritty story that pulls no punches and it isn't afraid to get right into the heart of the required subject. For 'Spotlight' to have been received by the critics as well as it has it had to stride unapologetically into this unbelievable and sordid affair. It needed to expose the sensitive and controversial information that some people may find confronting but in the context of this outstanding production, absolutely essential. It destroyed lives and revealed the blatant arrogance of this pious organisation.The all star cast jumps right out at you even before the opening scenes are shot up onto the screen. Based on true events, 'Spotlight' pushes all the right buttons from the beginning. As the name implies, 'Spotlight' refers to the investigative journalism team who report for the Boston Globe newspaper. They are thorough, relentless and will stop at nothing to expose headline stories that affect the everyday lives of normal American's. When the new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), drops a potentially explosive story in the lap of Spotlight chief, Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), about allegations of sexual abuse involving the Catholic Church, Robinson and his loyal crew go about uncovering one of the greatest criminal cover-ups in human history. The deeper their investigation goes the more sadistic and shocking the outcome becomes. Fingers are pointed, people are accused and the list of clergy involved becomes larger and larger. The whole situation ceases to become a Boston problem and grows to a worldwide exposure. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo are part of the investigative team as young committed journalists Sacha Pfeiffer and Mike Rezendes respectively. McAdams performance is award worthy and Ruffalo is fully engaged in a role that matches his talents. Michael Keaton has found his niche in Hollywood as a sort after mentor showcasing another strong performance as the tenacious and hard hitting Robinson. The real 'cherry' in the cast is the presence of the magnificent Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian who represents the victims in the whole saga. Tucci adds the class that takes 'Spotlight' to another level with an engrossingly accomplished performance.This is the best journalistic drama since 1976's 'All the President's Men'. Tom McCarthy has centred his narrative within the confines of the Boston Globe's newsroom as it should have been. 'Spotlight' doesn't shy away from the true nature of newspaper drama and the audience benefits from such an authentic setting. Top shelf acting from some of the very best young talent sparks the fire that captivates the viewer. Throw in some true icons in Keaton and Tucci and 'Spotlight' has the perfect balance. This film will be classified as the very best in its category and has set a benchmark in terms of confronting realism. Sit back and enjoy.",False
18,10,I Remembered Why I love Movies,lord_ashour,n/a,15/08/2025,"Throughout the year I watched many movies and by the middle of the year I was finding it hard to watch a movie. I really had to force my self. I thought my love for movies is dying and I'm more of a TV person now.I was wrong.This movie (and the big short) proved to me that it wasn't me, it was actually the movies I've seen this year.This movie has it's flaws for sure. But the acting, script, direction, design and pace of the movie adds a lot to an already strong and heart breaking story. I was on the edge of my seat and even after the movie ended I couldn't move for a while.A well made film that I recommend to any drama fan. It certainly helped me find my love for movies again.Even with it's flaws I give it a 9.5",False
19,n/a,Excellent Story and Performances,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spotlight (2015)**** (out of 4)Excellent movie based around the Boston Globe's investigation into various accounts of sexual abuse that was hidden by the Catholic Church.Obviously, SPOTLIGHT doesn't deal with a fun subject but the film is the perfect example of how to make a great movie. Take a great director and give him a great script to work with. Then you get a great cast to deliver great performances and bring those lines of dialogue and story to life. Why aren't more movies made like this? I'm going to guess it's because these types of films aren't going to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office but if you're a fan of cinema then SPOTLIGHT offers a whole lot.The subject matter itself is something that will make you blood boil but director Tom McCarthy handles it in a very classy way. The screenplay is so great because it really comes across as a blueprint on how journalism should work and obviously while watching the film you're going to think back to movies like THE FRONT PAGE and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. The story here is one that certainly grabs your attention and McCarthy does an excellent job at building up the tension as the reporters race against a clock but also race to find more victims to try and build case.Again, the subject matter isn't pretty but the film perfectly blends the drama of the victim's story as well as the drama and moral clause that people like reporters have. It certainly doesn't hurt that we're given an excellent cast that bring the material to life. Michael Keaton turns in another wonderful performance as the main guy who maybe connected to the crimes. Liev Schreiber has never been better than he is here as the man who pushes for the investigation. Then you have a tender performance from Rachel McAdams as well as Stanley Tucci delivering his finest work in years. With that said, Mark Ruffalo steals the film with his remarkable performance as the main reporter trying to bust the creeps who hid the crimes. The emotion, rage and power in his performance jumps right off the screen.SPOTLIGHT is technically quite flawless as the cinematography, the score, editing and every other aspect are terrific. Of course, a movie like this works on an intelligent level because it asks questions to the viewer and doesn't always just spell out the answer. The movie manages to be highly entertaining from start to finish and it really packs a punch without having to resort to preaching.",False
20,7,Solid Film Lacking Dramatic Punch,sunraider,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a solid drama elevated by superior acting from a top-notch cast but I left the theater somewhat underwhelmed. The movie lacked the sort of drama that makes you wonder how the story will end even when you know how the story will end. The main problem is that the Catholic Church just doesn't come across as a particularly forceful adversary. We're told that the Church is so powerful and has kept the abuse hidden for decades, but when a group of reporters actually goes digging they encounter some roadblocks but nothing that gives you the sense that the Church was something to be feared. While I didn't necessarily need Cardinal Law to dispatch some Opus Dei goons to discourage the reporters and the victims, the movie would have been more rewarding if they'd encountered much stronger resistance from the Church, public officials, and their own family and friends.",False
21,9,Truly captures the power of investigative journalism.,Akundu1998,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of the rare movies which is so real in it's approach and the way it was shot. It really captures the power of investigative journalism. It is based on a true story and it has done justice to all the characters who were involved in the investigation. The director has tried to keep the story real and authentic. None of the scenes were over the top or over dramatic. The acting was also spot-on. The movie emphasized on the importance of good and powerful journalism and the impact it can have on the system, which is sometimes so corrupted and cruel.",False
22,7,All the Paedo-Priest's Men,bob-the-movie-man,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Spotlight"" is the investigative team at the Boston Globe newspaper who focus on 'big' issues that they select to pursue - work that can take many months to come to fruition. Headed up by Robby Robinson (Michael Keaton) the rest of his team are Mike (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha (Rachel McAdams) and family man Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). It's 2001 and times they are a changin' at The Globe. New editor Marty Baron (Liev Schrieber) is a workaholic wild duck from Florida with transformation in mind. He sees value in the team pursuing a 'cold' story about a Catholic priest accused of multiple counts of paedophilia, all of which appears to have been quietly 'shushed up' by the church. The investigation progressively uncovers a far more widespread and murkier story that goes on to break as a global scandal for the Catholic church.This is an important film given its controversial subject matter. And the acting is all top-notch. Michael Keaton feels extremely comfortable in his role as the investigative journalist, delivering one of the most 'goose-bumpy' lines in the film (as seen in the trailer) - ""Which story do you want us to write - because we're writing one of them"". He must have been disappointed not to receive another Best Actor nomination for this.Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams both did get the nod for the Supporting Actor/Actress nominations: Ruffalo's performance in particular is stellar, full of earnest passion. But it has to be said that all of the rest of the cast also more than pull their weight, with Liev Schrieber and John Slattery (as sub-editor Ben Bradlee) being very strong and the ever-reliable Stanley Tucci electrifying the screen as the dilligent but cranky lawyer Garabedian. As I write this, the Screen Actors Guild has just awarded ""Spotlight"" the award for the Best Ensemble Cast, and this is well deserved.The film looks great, with cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi (""The Grey"", ""Silver Linings Playbook"") supported by fantastic lighting and superb editing (also Oscar nominated). It's refreshing that the location filming in Boston doesn't lean on the more 'touristy' shots normally depicted. The persistent and effective piano score is by Howard (""LOTR"") Shore.So, with all this going for it, I'm heading for a 10-star rating then? Well, actually, no. There is something distinctly missing in the film that was initially difficult to put my finger on. The film bears closest comparison with 1976's Redford/Hoffman classic ""All The President's Men"". And whilst it does compare in some ways (a lot of indecipherable dialogue and a mass of different names being one!) there's a key ingredient missing. While both stories were true, and you KNEW what the outcome was, ""All The President's Men"" still managed to build up an incredible sense of tension of the ""will they, won't they"" kind that is almost completely missing here. Not that there isn't the opportunity: for example, will delays (caused by certain other newsworthy events happening in September of that year) allow ""The Herald"" to break the story first? But no, the opportunity is squandered. A significant twist in the story (not spoiled here) around Keaton's character is also let off like a damp squib on a rainy night. And where was the scene of 'reaction' from the church, led by Boston's Cardinal Law (Len Cariou)?So the two Oscar nominations I would most have issues with are Best Director (for actor/director Tom McCarthy) and Best Picture: undeniably it's a good film, and you should go and see it, but in my eyes it was an opportunity missed - - it should have been an absolute classic.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

23,10,A SOBERING EXPERIENCE,thetrunkstory,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watching this film for the easily the fifth time and realizing how remarkable it is. The Trunk (which this profile is modeled under) is a perfect prequel to this remarkable film.To realize that so many people were affected during this amazing discovery and refused to speak is a huge lesson to all- Tell your truths as there are good guys waiting in the wings to help you.Keaton, Ruffalo, McAdams and the rest do a remarkable job. Tom McCarthy is a.wonderful director. His penchant for not only adapting the book to film, but also his minimalist approach to cinematography makes you feel as though you are part of the discovery of this insanely tragic story.I highly recommend this film.",False
24,7,A good docu-drama but nothing more,PrashunChakraborty,n/a,15/08/2025,"I liked this film, thought it was a well done solid film. But I am afraid I can't say anything more than that, it is very documentary like which can be it's biggest strength (a very fact driven plot heavy film) or it's biggest weakness (characters feel cold and distant and other than the plot nothing really impresses, also quite bland in the visuals department). However the characters do start to show some life nearing the end of the film but by that time damage is done it can be hard if not impossible for viewers to differentiate between the reporters for nearly one and a half hour of the film, they all suffer from different faces but same objective syndrome and inadequate effort is made to separate one from the another. Also speaking of run-time, this film is a wee bit over two hours long, editing especially in the first half could have made this film a bit crispier. However I did like the accuracy level in the film regarding the cellphones, ads, electronics and the cars used in 2001; a lot of films these days are becoming very careless in this regard. I would compare it to last year's Foxcatcher another fact driven docu-drama film, solidly acted, but nothing special in the direction, editing and cinematography department, I would still recommend it but no way this film deserves a second watch, you can absorb everything there is to get in a single viewing. All in all, a solid well written docu-drama which will have it's time in the ""spotlight"" (pun!) this Oscar season and will become ""oh that movie about pedo priests"" by next year's Oscar season.",False
25,2,boring movie,hamutal,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a screenwriter this movie really upset me - a bunch of journalists expose a case, where hundreds of children have been molested by priests, and covered up by the church. How do the journalists expose it? they call up a bunch of guys who said it before, but nobody listened to them. No doubt it's an important story, however I didn't detect any brilliant journalism - this is not All the President's Men, nor is it The Verdict where Paul Newman battled against the church. Spotlight reporters never stray in the dark or risk anything - the story is basically handed to them on a silver platter, and they only verify it. Drama? hell with it. worst of all - No brilliant cinema, no actions, just dialogue about this and that, we hardly get to know the characters outside of work, so we don't care about them. Bottom line is that this horrible case leaves hardly any impact. By the end of the movie you just realize that there have been pedophile priests. Didn't we already know this? No climax, no anticlimax, no heroes to root for. Hell I don't understand the raving reviews.",True

1,5,Unfortunately and ironically forgettable (again),angelo-aufderheide-2912,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show feels like the culmination of many true crime shows nowadays. It gives you that familiar feeling, as if you've seen this case before. In fact, you might have seen it elsewhere. This sense of déjà vu doesn't just come from the repetitive cases but also from the contemporary production style.While Bill Kurtis remains a central figure, he doesn't contribute as much in terms of voiceover or reporting. Don't misunderstand me - he's still the highlight of the show and shines when given the opportunity to speak. It's evident he's not as involved as he once was. However, I can't fault him. It's commendable that he's still active in the industry at 82 years old. But the rest of the show?It's lackluster.There's an overreliance on interview and interrogation footage.It's the same retelling of cases featured in multiple other shows, be it on ""TV"" or YouTube.Instead of on-the-ground reporting or investigative work, we're presented with generic stock footage. Gone are the days of the reporter's evocative walkthroughs or crime scene reenactments.DNA seems to be the magic bullet for solving every case. I suspect the show wasn't intended to focus solely on DNA, but it's become a common theme. Unfortunately, it's now a gimmick that makes me want to switch off. It's just tedious.Most cases end with plea deals and life sentences. No court dramas, which often added depth and intrigue to an episode.In summary, give it a watch if you enjoyed the newer versions of Cold Case Files or American Justice. Watch if you're a fan of Bill Kurtis. But if you're not intrigued by either, perhaps skip it.",False
2,1,So slow,broker-33680,n/a,16/08/2025,"Holy cow. It was a struggle to get through the very first episode. After watching other fast paced crime shows, this one lacks in material and speed to get to the resolution. This first episode drags on and on... there are little to no pictures of anything other than Lori showing the same crime scene over and over again. There are no additional pictures or mugshots of other considered suspects. It even seems that anyone being interviewed about this crime are told to speak in such a slow manner that the show just drags. I was really hoping for another exciting new show on crime. I am very disappointed.",False

1,8,Great visuals and kudos to including lesser known species.,toreaurstad-57248,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first episode from Borneo skips much footage of elephants but instead shows clips of the sun bear, proboscos monkeys and pitcher plants. I have seen nature TV shows for decades and this is a trend I hope to see more of. If you watch nature programmes, they usually are about the big mammals. Seeing footage of lessEr known species is a great thing about this series.The narrator is obviously a choice maybe suited for children TV shows like Peppa Pig instead of a quality nature documentary series. She obviously do not have a degree in biology. I would rather listen to Sir David Attenborough. She also adds interpretation of what the animals are thinking, all in all it sounds very corny like listening to a fairy tale.",False
2,7,Human race destroy nearly everything on the earth !,zanyarkf,n/a,15/08/2025,Thos docimentary show us and proof the human race is most dangerous and ruthless being on the earth we are destroy every habitat and most of species like seuran says human is the cancer of the earth!!,False
3,8,just so pretty,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,BBC travels around the globe visiting various species. Helena Bonham Carter is the narrator. She's fine although it takes getting used to since her voice is so recognizable. This is a six part limited series with one for the making of. It is yet another nature show from BBC. They do know how to make them looking so pretty. This one is that for sure. My only concern is that these shows are too beautiful and people come away thinking that the natural world is fine. Pictures say a thousand words and these pictures are just so very pretty. I guess I'll just watch these shows as the world burns down.,False
4,10,Astonishingly good,ajae-54401,n/a,15/08/2025,This is at the caliber of Planet Earth people. Astounding cinematography and excellent footage. I have been watching nature documentaries all my life and I learned so many things in the first episode alone. Please do watch it. It is damn near flawless.,False
5,10,Another amazing look at the planet.,theeuglycasanvax,n/a,15/08/2025,"I find Helena's voice to be fine, but then again I'm a fan of her acting. Learned about quite a free interesting creatures I had no clue existed. I also like the inside Eden but at the end that shows the behind the scenes of filming, pretty neat.",False
6,10,Fantastic nature show,loubirdling,n/a,15/08/2025,This new series is a wonderful story about the places that still beautifully exist in our somewhat crumbling globe.It truly is a breath of fresh air!We very much enjoy the photography along with a sense of hope for our planets animals.,False
7,6,"The visuals are great, but narrating what the animals are supposedly thinking is just stupid",0w0,n/a,15/08/2025,"Why on earth would you narrate what the animals are thinking? ""Mhhh, these are some tasty leaves"".... ""oooh, the water is nice and refreshing""..... it's freaking irritating.Other than the 1st-person narration, the series is really good. It's too bad that the series is spoiled by that, otherwise this could have been a 9/10 nature series.",False
8,5,Saccharine,paulie-70246,n/a,15/08/2025,Helena Bonham Carter's sickly sweet metronome-like narration makes this series unbearable to listen to.,False
9,5,Great photography but,derrirp9,n/a,15/08/2025,"Why is the narrator speaking to me like I'm a child? This is a documentary, not a fairy tale movie adaptation.",False
10,5,like/unlike,Max_Lucas,n/a,15/08/2025,"Beautiful close up film footage. But the narration needs improvement. If you're going to add drama, be sure to put the two subjects in the same frame.",False
11,2,False Footage (rating was 2 not 7 as below),ianmorgan-90208,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are several parts of this series that are taken from David Attenboroughs 'Africa' series which is extremely lazy directing/editing. Especially when footage of the Kalahari desert from David's series is trying to be passed off as the Namib in this series. Makes me wonder how much work has actually gone into this entire thing. Footage of the elephants is also from David's series. I've got to ask, did you really think you would get away with it and no one would notice? My advice would be leave it to Sir David and try your hand at something else. Or at least use your own footage, that would be a start.",False
12,4,Drop the excessive drama in the narration - it's painful,limmcintyre,n/a,15/08/2025,"The photography is truly spectacular. What wrecks it for me is the overly dramatic narration, the apparent need to choke viewers with awe with every sentence. At first, I thought it was Helena Bonham Carter's folly at trying to be David Attenborough. Then, I heard the same in a BBC series - Serengeti I-II with the same over-wrought diction coupled with ill-suited overly-loud music, this time narrated by Joseph Boyega. These are accomplished actors with good voices, so now I must conclude that the producers have required them to give this unwelcome twist to their delivery to a corny script. Hold on to that footage, however. It is a privilege to take in such worldly wonders. We can only hope that somehow, against the odds, they can endure.",False

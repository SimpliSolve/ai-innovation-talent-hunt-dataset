1,10,Riveting!,JennTeigs,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie is absolutely riveting. I was deeply moved by how the events of October 7th were reflected, though on a smaller scale. The Fogel massacre is a story that still resonates today. It should never be forgotten. The words spoken in the film echo the voices of those who lived through the aftermath of October 7th, but the film still manages to leave you with hope and excitement, rather than devastation.The cinematography is stunning, and it feels like you're right there in the West Bank. The experience is unexpected; you feel a mix of nervousness and connection to the soil beneath your feet. The land itself holds memories, and you can sense it in every step.This film is powerful and beautifully made, with a respectful and authentic portrayal of tragedy and resilience. It doesn't manipulate you, but rather invites you to feel the weight of the story and the strength of those who endure. It's definitely a must-see and one that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",False

It was heartbreaking, educational, and uplifting. So many films today focus on hate, bloodshed, and proving a point, but this film was far from that. It offered education in a way that anyone, regardless of background, can understand. It's a perfect balance, delivering its message without exploiting tragedy. The way it brings awareness to such a sensitive subject while offering hope and understanding is remarkable. Truly amazing and should be required when learning about the West Bank. A definite must-watch for anyone interested in the Middle East conflict.",False

1,8,Insanity,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie was co-directed by Ross Snyder and William Hellfire, who worked for Gary Whitson, the founder of W. A. V. E. Productions, in the 90s and was astounded to learn in 2016 that his old boss was still making his strange films. He pitched him on the idea for this and Whitson gave him full access to all of his movies as well as the people who made - and still make - them on spec.That's right. If there's a horror movie you want to see or more to the point, a death or struggling scene with an attractive actress, W. A. V. E. will film it for you with our their actresses, including Clancy McCauley, Debbie D., Laura Giglio, Deanna Demko, Pamela Sutch and Tina Krause, who all appear in the film.If you have any love for SOV - I mean, this site just spent nearly three weeks on these movies, so if you're reading this, you might - this has so may folks show up like Goregasm director High Gallagher, Tempe Video's J. R. Bookwalter, the guys from Bleeding Skull and Lunchmeat and nearly everyone else associated with W. A. V. E.There's also great footage from old Chiller Theater conventions, Debbie D. On The Joe Franklin Show and most of the cast laughing about both the silliness of so many of the movies and the conditions that they were made under.This movie has no judgment for the films that W. A. V. E. creates and is so good natured about movies that are basically just about women being stabbed, strangled, drowned and even devoured by a giant woman in Eaten Alive: A Tasteful Revenge. Instead, these sleazy movies seem to be made by a strange family of sorts that ended up creating outsider art, if outsider art made several films devoted to women in quicksand.Man, instead of talking head horror docs that tell us everything we want to know about safe subjects, more people need to go all in on the dark alleys of the genre. This movie is incredible.",True

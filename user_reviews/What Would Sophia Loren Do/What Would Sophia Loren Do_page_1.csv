1,7,Two old ladies talking about life,DLochner,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very nice, entertaining documentary that at first glance has nothing to do with Sophia Loren - but rather with an old lady who tells about her life. A life that is very similar to Sophia Loren. Still not very informative and superficial.",False
2,8,A heartwarming story of two amazing ladies,maccas-56367,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a heartwarming little documentary. I had only previously seen a 2-3 Sophia Loren films (and enjoyed them). This gave me a whole new appreciation for her talents and remarkable career.Nancy Kulik and Sophia Loren make such an adorable pair. I could've listened to them both talk about life for a lot longer than 30 minutes. This short film is as much about life itself as it is Sophia Loren, and how her work has played a key role in Nancy Kulik's life.Makes me want to go eat pasta and delve into Sophia Loren's impressive filmography.",False
3,8,A positive influence transcends everything...,karlmartin2211,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, I found that really emotional how an Italian lady looked to Sophia Loren to guide her through her & her families life. I'm really glad that I've seen all the films which they discussed during this little documentary too and I'm sure that made it more relatable. Could have easily been made to be longer, but ultimately it's beautiful for being just exactly what it is.",False
4,7,By another name....Watch it anyway!,noellew-10369,n/a,16/08/2025,"The title of this film suggests a completely different type of experience than is delivered. The film is neither witty or clever, no pivots to nor insight into the subject. The structure and narrative are dissonant and uninteresting. YET. It's only 32 minutes of your life. It is delightful and, at moments. deeply moving. We all know the ""Italian mom"" and hey, is there ever too much of Sophia?",False
5,6,Mildly Amusing Comdey - What Would Sophia Loren Do?,arthur_tafero,n/a,16/08/2025,"A simple story about a grandmother whose idol is Sophia Loren. Now, in her autumn years, the grandmother keeps referring to Loren for guidance in her day to day problems. She tries to imagine what an obviously younger Sophia Loren would do. In this way, she is able to keep some of her youth in the fire. It would appear as if an older adult cannot come to the same conclusion as a very young Sophia Loren. Loren, to say the least, was an opportunist, who married much older and fatter Carlo Ponti. I am very sure there were several young men in Loren's life that were far better looking and had much better physiques. But that was not what she was looking for. She was looking for stardom, and found it under Ponti. I am not sure grandma would be doing the same thing.",False
6,8,More than meets the eye,gnianello,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well done story about an Italian mom. Some reviews here miss the point entirely. Nancy is way more interesting than Loren is. Otherwise why watch it. A real story of a real life. While Loren is a true star and has way more class and character than the fools that are stars today, Nancy's story really moved me. Well worth 30 minutes.",False
7,5,What's the point?,lpadilla-93844,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm confused why this was turned into a 30 minute documentary. It seems like it should have been a home movie for Nancy's family. She's quite lovely and she does well on camera. But do we need to hear her life story?She has no ties between her and Sophia Loren, other than they are both Italian women. It is basically a fan letter to her favorite actress. I'm stunned Loren took part in the documentary.Well made, but a total head-scratcher.",True
8,8,Discombobulated,Saoustou88,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went into this documentary with a different perception of what it actually was about. Confusing, why this lady is comparing herself to the Queen Sophia Loren who I adore and admire, such talent and grace and extreme beauty to this very day.Sophia's moments are the most and ONLY interesting and beautiful parts of the docu, snippets of her wonderful films etc...Other than that, there is zero point of this documentary!",False
9,2,"Watch Out For Footage From ""Two Women"" . . . .",sundayatdusk-97859,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, Nancy Kulik, an Italian-American idolizes Sophia Loren, but not in a nutty way, and not because she has no life of her own. Mrs. Kulik actually has had a very busy, fulfilling life, complete with an important job, a loving husband, four kids and grandchildren. Through it all, though, she would ask herself what Sophia Loren would do in certain situations she encountered. Later in the film, she gets to meet Sophia Loren, too, and talk to her about their lives.This could have been a totally charming short film, with some sad moments, but it was wrecked with the showing of the gang rape scene from the movie ""Two Women"". Totally wrecked. I fast-forwarded through those scenes and then only had partial interest in the film until the end. Whoever decided to include that movie clip in such a warm, fun film made a big, big mistake.",False
10,10,"Short, but super inspiring.",vdlaprieto,n/a,16/08/2025,"I always liked Sophia Loren and have watched many of her movies throughout the years, but now I want to watch her entire film catalogue. She started to act in movies at 19!",False
11,5,5,Edvis-1997,n/a,16/08/2025,I found it boring and really unnecessary of this documentary.,False

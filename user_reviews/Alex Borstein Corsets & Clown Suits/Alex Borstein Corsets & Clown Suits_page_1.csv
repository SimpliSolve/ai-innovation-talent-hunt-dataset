1,8,A Pleasant Watch,aobenshain,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a generally funny performance and has heartfelt moments. It isn't a bad way to spend 1.5 hours if you have the time to kill. The only issues are that at times the delivery seemed to drag and the audience itself can seem a bit flat/dull, which takes away from the overall experience.Mr. Mills and Mr. Rey probably should have had a more detailed introduction up front so we weren't sitting wondering who they were (at least up until they were introduced halfway through). Nevertheless, they were a pleasant addition and only added to the experience.As to the overall ""preachiness"" that some reviewers have mentioned: Yes, there are times where I wanted to say, ""Yep, I agree with that position 100%, now let's keep it moving."" Still, as ""preachy"" as it was, her messages are things that need to be talked about right now.",False
2,8,Absolutely Hilarious,ericgoldberg-50159,n/a,16/08/2025,Alex Borstein is hilarious and also can sing really well. She has come a long way from MAD TV. The original songs she sings in this special are funny and clever. Alex's parents are in the audience and she talks to them during the show. She is an extremely talented performer who always made me laugh. I hope she does more comedy specials because she nails it. This is one of the better stand ups I've seen over the years. Alex isn't afraid to say what she wants to say and doesn't hold back. She even makes fun of herself and doesn't take herself seriously. Move over Mrs. Maisel! This is the marvelous Ms. Borstein at her finest!,False
3,8,I Love This Firecracker's Brand of Humor!,mikemcmillan2002,n/a,16/08/2025,"She made me laugh, and cackle a few times, and generally smile widely through the whole show. Not your typical stand-up, Alex through some great curve balls...like having her parents Judy and Irving, come to a show where she sings about Mushtats. If you like her in Mrs Maisel, and Family Guy uncensored, you'll love this show even more, I kid you knot!It's hard to tell if, when she sings, if that is her real singing voice, or if she is imitating a singer. The point sized pistol is so good at mimicry it's hard to tell when you actually here the real voice she uses for every day speech.As for the reviewers who pretend not to enjoy this style of ha ha, why would you bother watching. You must already know her style given everything else she's done. Oh well, haters and trolls gotta hate and troll.",False
4,10,I Loved It!,swstbdnsb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unlike another reviewer, I was thoroughly entertained by Alex's combination of stand-up and singing. I have loved her since MadTV, and on the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel I applaud her character's wit, (grudging) warmth, and evolution from whatever it was she did at The Gaslight(!) to agent.But back to this show-I did not mind her liberal opinions and heartfelt observations. For me, they merely served to act as a respite from the belly laughs which her comedy elicited from me. I never thought I would find myself laughing at some of the darker material which occasionally popped up, but I did.The musicians who served as her partners in crime had their own moments to shine, and even the ASL interpreter had some humorous bits.Keep up the great work, Alex!",False
5,6,Interesting,patspahr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some parts were better than others. I liked the approach of comedy with music. The songs were funny, the jokes were funny. She missed the mark a few times, but like she said, ""its free to watch- i mean you
didn't get prime to watch my show. "" so i totally got my money's worth. What the *&^&, my review needs to be 600 words. Well let me just tell you, she was funny. I laughed. For another 200 words i'll mention how i laughed. She took some big swings and hit a few good ones. It was well rehearsed. The musicians were excellent. It wasn't just a stand up walking around an empty stage. It was more.",False
6,9,Alex as you've never seen her!,rlinsk-786-224562,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAlex Borstein in this Amazon Prime special is a scream. Inventive, outrageous, funny as hell. Some of it does cross a line into the crass or vulgar (the Hitler maid song, oy vey; the ""Jewmanji"" song, too much self-loathing in my book) ... but heck - it's comedy, and the bits don't last that long. It's a nice blend overall between the standup material and the songs. She can really sing! The musicians and comic foils Salva and Eric get their due as well. I was previously familiar with Alex as Susie in Maisel and somewhat from Gilmore Girls so this was a nice surprise. Glad we stumbled into it and it was the most we laughed in a while! Ignore the miffed right-wingers pulling down the ratings here.",True
7,7,"Something great, but...",AlanBradley-32347,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a huge fan since Mad TV. Also her role on Mrs. Maisel was so good. The special started so good and funny. Then the songs. They were a perfect addition The medley of Changes and Hero's, such an incredible rendition! Also 99 Red Ballons into Love Will Tear Us Apart was so fun.But, as has become the norm we had to hear another celebrity take on gender issues. She actually says ""Why does anyone care? It's none of your business"". That's the problem. We don't care. We're tired of having to hear about it. We don't want it in what's supposed to be entertainment. It's not entertaining. I watch these things to relax and recover from my day spent dealing with the world and its issues. Pay attention to why so many movies and shows are tanking right now.And of course, we had to hear how awful the world is. This had potential to be so amazing. It was at times.",False
8,10,"Breathe if fresh air, really love Alex",connorwcampbell,n/a,16/08/2025,"Alex Borstein is a superstar. Soooo much better than a lot of the stand up comedies that are receiving more notoriety at the moment. Hopefully she can lead a TV or a movie role next. She is a force to be reckoned with! She has only improved since madTV and showed her inner brain mechanisms through this comedy special and in her recent TV show mrs maisel. She is having a resurgence and deserves it ten fold. Also loved how it showed the dichotomy of this beautiful woman that is hilarious (on mrs maisel) and how Alex being a truly hilarious person but had to play this ambiguous and aggressive character that was just as attracting due to her hilarious and magnetic personality.This even filmed in the same theatre that mrs maisel performed her stand up. Alex is hilarious and the fact that she doesn't star as the main lead in a television show makes me question if we have really gotten further enough as a society to have a women in her ""past due"" age that can achieve the same success or staring role as a woman in her 20s/30s.She is my type of comedy and I'm looking forward to more specials from her.",False
9,2,Dated and uncomfortable,keltonmichelle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Felt like she either rehearsed too much and lost her excitement, or didn't rehearse enough and was super nervous. She had my attention until her abortion screed. Just not funny, instead really sad. I hope her kids never watch her scream ""abort, abort, abort!""I loved her on MadTV, maybe she'll come back with something better when she's in a better place. I'm glad Maisel is working out for her, but this show just shouldn't have happened this quickly. Ride the wave from Maisel, work on some new material, and come back when you're happier.I wouldn't spend the time on this one. Watch the best parts on YouTube or something.",False
10,10,"I didn't really like it, but it is great!",jtomlinson-48204,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't like it... too real! I expected to be more entertained and Alex sings really well! That was a great surprise! She is obviously a really nice, kind lady with a huge heart and sense of humanity. She swayed my views on a couple of things. She reminded me of a couple others. When the show was over I found myself immediately calling my Mom, a former leader of the women's republican committee who has voted demo on occasions . Not surprisingly we agreed on everything. I mean she is a really nice lady too, and she raised me.I just ran into a man who has been abusive toward me for years. This time I smiled at him. That is so much worse than me avoiding him. Thank you for the kick in the pants Alex!I think this should be required viewing for men and women over the age of 13. She is quite a talented lady with important messages. No, it's not much of a comedy show. I think I could do it funnier, but then nobody would listen to it because I am not Alex Bornstein. But maybe I will play with it. This actually hit me harder than any of the other social consciousness couched in comedy routines have. Alex is big enough to het away with it, despite apparently being tiny!I read a lot about her after seeing this even though I have watched her for years and previously knew nothing about her.I watched the show in the morning. I think that is best because it gave all day to think back on it and won't keep me up tonight!I don't want to say anything about the show because I don't want to have any spoilers! Some of it was pretty outrageous though! Especially given who is in the audience! Lol She is quoted as saying she does not have a place that says she has gone too far. I cannot imagine! Liberating or terrifying!Good job!I love the people with pencils up their backsides who will complain about it. I bet it will still have an effect with them.",False
11,10,Hilarious!,angelaw-69401,n/a,16/08/2025,"How the heck does this only have a rating of 6.6? This is one of the best things I've seen all year! Alex's character is my favorite on Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and now I know why. I had no idea she did stand-up in real life which is ironic, given the character she plays on a show about a comedienne.In Corsets & Clown Suits, Alex does stand-up and also incorporates singing with her two musician friends who I thought were adorable. I was laughing the entire time, that's how funny Alex is. This is truly a gem. She's excellent with playing off of the audience as well.If you want to watch comedy with substance, watch this.",False
12,10,Brilliant Topical and Musical,kateann1027,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAlex is beyond brilliant ( from MadTV and Mrs Maisel) and her Standup is infused with her parents in the audience and 2 Ukulele musicians she met on her Divorce Holiday in Spain, add lightness and fun ( and who knew she could sing too?) to her compilation of stories, passion, and ribald blue comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment and wish it were even longer. Her authenticity, generous perspective about Women , her anecdotes on her 20 year marriage and two kids, her dating stories, and her authenticity all make this worth your time. She sees our world with a great sense of humor and for me she goes to the top of my list of triple threats. Shes a STAR.",True
13,10,Súper clever!!!,normaconde-dance,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stand up comedy so clever and actual and funny, singing songs, remembering past, talking about actual stuff, Genius!!!! Just clever and smart!! So good! I enjoyed a lot! I thought was just other serie like others, but this is so nice! I would like going and see this show life!! Maybe you can bring it to Barcelona!! I recommend for people who like laughing but at the same using sarcasm of the reality. I have to write a 600 words to review and I don't know what else to write hahaha so I'm just typing what I'm thinking haha well, just clever and funny and I really really really 19 words more, really like it!!! 600 done!!!!",False
14,9,Entertaining,dbuckshnis,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI like Alex on the Marvelous Mrs M as Susie. She's really gruff so it was interesting to see her toned down. She looks great with her long hair and clown outfit with the cute suits. The Linda Hamilton piece was really funny. The two ukulele dudes are funny too. The one does look like Steven Colbert. Her jokes were well written and the parent jokes and piece was very funny with the green cock sticker on her face. The set design was relaxing and lighting was great. Her current events of comedy are funny - and the audience seemed to like her.I found this comedy hour to be a bit like Carol Burnett. I will watch more too.,True
15,1,Insulting to your intelligence,cescagirl,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is it possible to delete shows from Amazon prime in order to spare others from humorless, predictable, mind numbing drivel?I tried, I really tried. I tried three times to get through this show and simply could not. The most exciting element of the show was the American Sign Language interpreter. She was great.The incorporation of the ""musical"" element was an excellent idea however executed very poorly. The material just was not funny.There were attempts made to be comically sexually explicit but they came off as if she were a Freshmen in high school trying to Woo that senior versity cheerleader. Then came the lectures about people referring to themselves in the third person. No thank you. Please do not insult the actual women who fought for Title IX .I expected more after enjoying her character in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, but this fell right off the stage.",False
16,9,"She sings, she dances, she tells jokes...",drjgardner,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're a fan from Mad TV or the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel or her many TV and film roles, you're going to love this stand-up routine in which she talks about her life, her family, life in general, and on occasions breaks into song and even dance. Surprise, she sings pretty good and while she's not going to win on Dancing with the Stars, she's not too bad in the dance either. Most of all, she's funny. Perhaps a little raunchy for some people, but funny nonetheless. The show is billed as Season 1 Episode 1, which is probably a joke, but if it means we'll see more, sign me up. BTW - you'll probably recognize the theatre that she is playing in. It's the same one from the Maisel show.",False
17,9,Classic Borstein,sarah-827-978121,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've fallen in love with Alex Borstein all over again. What's not to love?! She's quirky, smart, insightful, says things as they are and brings her unique personality to the whole performance, supported by two great musicians. She's not afraid to go places that others avoid, is happy to elegantly take the mickey out of her own culture, and the songs and musical inbetween give the whole show a feel of cabaret and burlesque. I found her humour smart and I thought it was a unique show that made you feel part of the audience. Ignore the haters, I feel like they rather missed the point. If you love Alex in Mrs Maisel, you'll love this too!",False
18,9,Perception and other P words!,RubyRed33,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI did not expect to love this show immediately, but I did. I did not expect to LOL in the first 5 minutes, but I did. I did not expect to relate to so much of what she said, but I did.Some of us only know Alex Borstein as Susie Myerson, from Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Some of us have seen her other works on shows ranging from Mad TV to Family Guy and so much more. This wasn't any of that.Her ability to keep it funny, but still be vulnerable & real with her audience, and still make us laugh SO hard was an absolute breath of fresh air. She was not recycling characters I've ever seen her play before, either. She was unapologetically herself. Right down to reminding women of the Inalienable Rights we are losing, listing the various ways to take care of our bodies (""no forced air, don't douche, keep the jewelry"", etc.) while covering a range of topics. Some are serious (like divorce) and some are seriously funny (coming out of a 20 yr marriage is akin to waking up from a coma). Gotta love this woman. She's got more raw honesty, humor, and cojones than most of the male comics I've seen on the touring circuit!It was refreshing to watch her inhabit her own skin. No characters. To hear her address her parents, who were both in the audience. And to see an ASL Interpreter on stage for the entire performance. Thanks for that inclusivity from this HoH human. Cheers to this new chapter of your life, Alex. You are fabulous! We'll keep watching you!",True
19,9,A Hilarious Journey Through Life's Absurdities,ytvipkonto,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Corsets & Clown Suits,"" Alex Borstein's 2023 comedy special, is a delightful rollercoaster of laughter that showcases her comedic brilliance and versatility.

20,3,This is not a stand up its her therapy,MajBlade2,n/a,16/08/2025,"From what I heard she and ex husband split in 2015 so its been a long time either she is totally still infatuated and he left her or she just despises him and cant move on. Then she started yelling abort abort abort. This is a Jewish woman with two children. I get it your a aggrieved feminist now that you were married for 20 years and had two kids but your marriage fell apart. She went on and on and on about a divorce from 7 years ago. And how she found her ""vagina"" this was an old act from the 90s that we have all heard especially the show she is on Mrs. Maisel. So not sure if this was anymore then a scream therapy session for her.",False
21,1,"Not funny, too ideological and incongruous",javieragarcia,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved Mrs. Maisel and I thougt that this would be an creative and sparkling show. Instead, I found a grotesque, vulgar and ideological stand up with too many sad themes: abortion, menstruation, etc. It was not funny at all and had too much agenda in it.The audience semmed to be a little.bound to be there, sometimes awkward, sometimes bored. Maybe if she stop forcing the scene and talk about daily issues, she will be recover her originality and charm in stage.I missed the clever, soft and subtle humor, that make the people smile in silence or even laugh out loud.Maybe the next time will be better... I hope.",False
22,4,"Purification , Purgation, and the Perception of Perception",jgreco7,n/a,16/08/2025,"Actress and comic Alex Borstein, making the most of the popular Mrs. Maisel, trods the boards in her own Amazon special, ""Corsets and Clown Suits,"" (or, ""Purification , Purgation, and the Perception of Perception""), a blending of comedy and psychodrama, that illustrates why self-deprecating humor, while always a matter of course, is not the best approach to self-perception.Following an inexplicable stripper, Borstein opens the show, not too perceptively, with a discourse on perception (as Chris Rock does in his Netflix special), giving the impression her performance will be something more than routine, but proving only to be a loss-leader. Trust the material.Who can blame her? Self-depreciation has been thus for many female comics, from Fanny Brice, to Totie Fields, to Joan Rivers, for whom low self-esteem was the standard bearer, and remains so, apparently, for Borstein (who has such a pretty face).Befitting her self-image, she dons a clown suit--albeit modified--and funny shoes, solely for the purpose of comic treatment, perhaps also as a failsafe. Trust the material. Granted, visual humor hardly ever fails, like miming the unappetizing state of her vagina and a lama's giving birth, but body-image shtick and feminine hygiene jokes are old standbys and strictly stand-up, not the substance of a performance piece, which, in this instance, I admit, is reaching, notwithstanding the musical interludes included with the price of admission (although hardly worth it). She sings well, sort of like Gomer Pyle lowering his voice to belt out ""The Impossible Dream,"" but it's not her singing that puts asses in seats. It's her own that does.",False
23,2,I wanted to love it but it was terrible,lisamuller-65702,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love her on Mrs Maisel so I was so excited to see this. I enjoy standup comedy - Gaffigan, Mulaney, Schneider, Madigan are some of my favs. By 10 minutes in with her griping about divorce and abortion I turned it off. Seemed like a personal vent fest not standup. Much more like a political soapbox. I guess if you share her political views or recently filed for divorce it may be entertaining or a therapy session. I hope I can see something different from her in the future because I think she is a talented comic. I would give a different comic special from her a watch to see if it's any different.",False
24,5,Adequately entertaining...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had no idea who Alex Borstein was prior to sitting down and watching this 2023 comedy special titled ""Alex Borstein: Corsets & Clown Suits"". But I opted to watch it and get acquainted with her comedy, since I had the opportunity to watch the show.And I was adequately entertained by this 2023 show. It ran for 81 minutes, which was a tad long, if I have to be bluntly honest. And the singing bits weren't really something that catered to my personal preferences when watching a comedy special. But hey, I am sure that there is an audience out there whom enjoy such.Alex Borstein did have a talent for being on the stage, and she felt very much at home and in her element. She had good enough material and were able to deliver her jokes with skill. However, she heckled her parents, whom were in the audience, a bit too much for my liking.I was adequately entertained, as I mentioned above, and were brought to a chuckle here and there. I wasn't really brought to full blown laughter, so this 2023 comedy special wasn't fully within my scope of comedy preference. I am not saying that ""Alex Borstein: Corsets & Clown Suits"" is a bad show, not at all, it just wasn't something that fit on my particular shelf of comedy.Watchable for what it was, with some good jokes throughout the course of the 81 minutes. If you enjoy comedy specials, then by all means you should check out ""Alex Borstein: Corsets & Clown Suits"".My rating of ""Alex Borstein: Corsets & Clown Suits"" lands on a five out of ten stars.",False

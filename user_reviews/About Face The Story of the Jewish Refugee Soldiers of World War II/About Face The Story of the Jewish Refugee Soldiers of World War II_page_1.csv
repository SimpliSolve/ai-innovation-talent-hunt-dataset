1,10,Masterpiece,recorder-1,n/a,16/08/2025,Simply a great film that shows the efforts that a few Jewish refugees went through to return and fight the Nazi war machine. I saw it at the GI film festival. The film moved me because of it's strong story and by the end I was in tears. The filmmakers did an excellent job in presenting the stories of the troops. They also showed the effect that the holocaust had on them both before and after leaving Germany. The fact that the one of the men was used as an interrogator by the US troops was amazing and the response from the Nazis needs to be seen. I wish more documentaries were like this one.,False

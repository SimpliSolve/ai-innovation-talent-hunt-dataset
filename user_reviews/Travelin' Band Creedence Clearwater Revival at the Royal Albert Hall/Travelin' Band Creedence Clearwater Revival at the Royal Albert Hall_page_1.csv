1,8,Very Good Music Documentary Concert,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"I always liked John Fogerty and Creedence but was never a fanatic. There music is very distinct and very American. This documentary and concert finale covers their first European trip. It is a good documentary because it weaves the background and history of the band in without making it boring. The story is told through interviews and old footage and in between concert and travel footage. It is a very cool look for the avid fan, or casual one. The concerto is excellent. Its has significance because it is from The Royal Albert Hall, where the Beatles went big, and around the time the Beatles announced they were splitting up. If you are a CCR fan I would add an additional star.",False
2,8,Great documentary and concert,grantss,n/a,16/08/2025,"A film that captures Creedence Clearwater Revival's concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London, during their 1970 European tour. We also have a history of the band to that point, all the way from their earliest days in school. Narrated by Jeff Bridges.Creedence Clearwater Revival were huge in the late 60s/early 70s and had a big influence on later bands but today, unfortunately, they're less well known. This documentary and concert footage are timely reminder of just how great they were.The documentary part is quite interesting though I sometimes feel Jeff Bridges overdoes the superlatives, making the narration sound less objective. He also sounds a bit drunk (and yes, I know that's how he always sounds).The concert is great: only about an hour long but packing in their biggest hits. Great music and musicianship.",False
3,7,Unexpected hit!,Wookie_Wookie,n/a,16/08/2025,"For a film like this to get almost no press and to have a quiet release on Netflix is a crime. This documentary was a really fun watch as it goes over the history of Creedence up until their performance at the Royal Albert Hall. Not only that but you get the full, unseen concert recording, remastered and all. I will admit I haven't seen the full concert portion yet but I'm going to take it in increments. Jeff Bridges as the narrator was a slam dunk as he gives a sort of heft to the narration that suits CCR. Although I would consider The Beatles: Get Back the gold standard of music documentaries, this should not be slept on and deserves a watch. Please tell your friends to watch this if they have any interest, it's worth it.7.8/10 (could change in the future)",False
4,10,CCR in alll their glory,PhilippeIII,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Great documentary on this iconic American band Their background, their rise and amazing success. The early pictures if the musicians are truly surprising. The prolific John Fogerty is seen as a true artist, exceptionnal musician and song writer. The Royal Albert Hall Concert in 1970 is a great rare look into their dynamic band workings. Although I have attended a John Fogerty concert, I had never had the chance to see all 4 band mates play together . Before the bad blood and legal lawsuits that came later. It is with great joy that we can watch the 4 guys play together. What else can I say, I truly enjoyed this film.",False
5,10,Born in the 60's,TomatoesareRotten,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew most of their hits as they were always being played throughout the duration of the Vietnam debacle, but some of this footage is utterly mesmerising. I've seen very little live footage of them over the decades, but to be blessed by the whole concert, at the Albert Hall in 1970, is a privilege worth savouring. The sound quality is bang on. To learn that ""The Fortunate One"" was all about the privileged who avoided the draft is fascinating in its own right. The astonishing thing about the live concert, is that the 4 of them are in a 20 foot radius of each other, tight in every aspect. Miss this at your peril.",False
6,7,Unclassying the Joint,TheFearmakers,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a teenager in the 1980's I said something out loud in front of an older guy who was actually around during the late 60's and early 70's... that Led Zeppelin was the biggest band in the world then... he said no, no way... The Rolling Stones were...Thinking of them only as a sixties thing, little did I know then about Mick Taylor and how great The Stones were and how big they were...So when narrator Jeff Bridges mumbles (about five times) that Creedence was always number 2 behind The Beatles and then Number One after their breakup, it's a bit of a stretch... actually it's an outright lie...CCR had many top ten hits and turned out albums like warhorses, but they were a popular niche compared to The Stones...And this is a pretty good documentary and a pretty great live show... The documentary of the band's rise occurs as bookends, and the only frustration is, if you're going to hear about a band beginning and climbing, you'll expect to hear the entire story... because their breakup is even more interesting than the years they existed...So that leaves the grungy powerhouse concert to stand alone... like Scorsese's Shine A Light for The Stones, this is more a concert film than doc, and the rowdy working glass rockers take on the otherwise classy prestige of England's Royal Albert Hall... a bunch of hillbillies raiding a mansion is what's being expected here...However, when you see the brainless hippie audience being even more of a contrast to the location... in particular three or four dancing like insane puppets at the foot of the stage while the band worked their butts off... that whole irony loses its... well... irony...A great concert's here, however, and John Fogerty and the band that backed him better than any musicians ever would... including the clean-toned rhythm playing brother perfectly contrasting to John's distorted menace... and a rhythm section that were as irreplaceable to John as he was to them: and this is all the proof of that you'll ever need of that fact.",False
7,10,Magic,billcr12,n/a,16/08/2025,"John Fogerty is a national treasure and after watching this documentary, I now have a greater appreciation for his talents as a singer, songwriter and guitar player.Jeff Bridges narrates the first half which covers Creedence Clearwater Revival's first tour of Europe with a few snippets of concert footage and gives a brief background on the four musicians.The second half is simply mind blowing. It was filmed in April of 1970 at Royal Albert Hall in London shortly after the breakup of The Beatles. John Fogerty was justifiably nervous as he took the stage but he says very little other than thank you in between the twelve song set list. No special lighting was used and the music is awesome. Two guitars, a bass and drums and a few large amplifiers filled the stage.I cranked up my small JBL computer speakers and recommend that anyone watching do the same.Here is the song list
1-Travelin' Band
2-Born on the Bayou
3-Green River
4-Tombstone Shadow
5-Fortunate Son
6-Commotion
7-Midnight Special
8-Bad Moon Rising
9-Proud Mary
10-The Night is the Right Time
11-Good Golly Miss Molly
12-Keep on Chooglin'",False
8,6,A welcome historic document of a great live performance,glenaobrien,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a rather odd documentary which stitches together two elements. First there is footage from the band's 1970 tour of Europe with candid scenes of the boys talking to the press etc. They seem like nice hard working guys, not interested in drugs or alcohol but only in making good music. In the process, the basic biographical story of the band is narrated by Jeff Bridges (thankfully, their original name 'The Gollywogs' didn't last).It's very clear (which we already knew) that Creedence *was* John Fogarty. He wrote the songs and it was his creative genius and guitar playing that made the band what it was. Don't get me wrong, the others were solid workmanlike musos. But you've only got to listen to their late career album Mardi Gras (1972), where John stepped back and let the others contribute songs, to realise how Fogarty really was the heart of the band. In fact, after Tom Fogarty left the band, they toured Europe again as a trio without a rhythm guitarist and they sounded fine.The second half of the film is the Royal Albert Hall concert and it's incredible. The band is incredibly tight having rehearsed and honed the songs in the studio and on tour until they were playing note perfect renditions of their signature swamp rock. For San Fransisco boys who'd never been to the South, they sure captured the sound of the Bayou. Creedence was the biggest band in the world at that time in terms of chart successes. They only really lasted five years (from 1968-1972) but during that time they recorded some of the most iconic songs of the era. Travelling Band is no work of genius as a documentary but it's a worthy historical document of a great band at the height of its powers.",False
9,9,R&B Meets Country Meets Grunge,nebohr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Warning: If you don't play this documentary at a high volume you will be missing out on the fun.I always thought that Creedence Clearwater Revival was the best band to come out of the 1960's and 1970's. Better, even, than the Beatles. Their country /grunge style always makes me smile whenever I hear it.The documentary begins with the boys on their 1970 European tour. Then there is some background on the roots, the founding of the band back in high school. They first went under the name ""The Blue Velvets"" and when John's older brother joined they switched to ""Tommy Fogerty and The Blue Velvets"".It's kind of funny how their first manager, Max Weiss, decided they should change their name to ""The Golliwogs"" so that they would sound more ""British""'. What better way to ride on the coattails of ""The British Invasion"" than to name yourselves after an ugly rag doll caricature of a black minstrel. But, in Max's defense, he did have a prior hit under his belt: the theme to the ""Charlie Brown"" TV specials is a jazz instrumental titled ""Cast Your Fate to the Wind"" by Vince Guaraldi.",False
10,8,The long overdue CCR footage at the Royal Albert Hall,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Travelin' Band: Creedence Clearwater Revival at the Royal Albert Hall"" (filmed in 1970; released in 2022; 86 min.) is a documentary about CCR's 1970 European tour, culminating with 2 shows at the legendary Royal Albert Hall in London. Thankfully someone had the foresight to film one of these sets. As the documentary opens, the 4 guys in CCR are right in front of the Royal Albert Hall, grinning from ear to ear. ""Can't wait to play here!"" We then get short clips from some of their other European shows (Copenhagen, Stockholm, Berlin, Paris). At that point we go back to the band's origins, in the late 50s in El Cerrito, CA. Indeed, by the time the band broke big in 1968, they had been together for years.Couple of comments: this is the long rumored release of the concert footage from CCR's show on April 14, 1970 at the Royal Albert Hall. Tis documentary is in fact a 3-for-1: there is the footage of them traveling around Europe (about 15 min.), then there is a look at the band's history leading up to that European tour (about 20 min.), and then comes the actual Royal Albert Hall show in its entirety (about 45 min.). If it were up to me, I'd have reduced the amount of time devoted to the band's history, and instead showing us more of the footage from the European tour (some gems like when they talk about that this is their very first visit to Europe, and their initial impressions). But of course the raison d'etre of this release is the Royal Albert Hall show. This was 8 month's after the band's legendary set at Woodstock. To be clear: they are in very fine form (check the outstanding ""Born On the Bayou""), rip-roaring through 12 cuts in just 42 minutes. Yes, that is not a typo, they complete set clocks in at 42 minutes. Not sure how this is possible. How many opening bands were there? Anyway, the audio quality is top notch (this is also available as a CD), and the video quality is okay but not top notch. But the historic significance of this only goes up with each passing year. (For another footage gem of that era, look on YouTube for Deep Purple's Concert for Group Orchestra, filmed at the very same Royal Albert Hall in September, 1969.)""Travelin' Band: CCR at the Royal Albert Hall"" premiered on Netflix last Fall, and I completely missed it. Thankfully Netflix recommended it to me recently based on my viewing habits, and I watched it just the other night. Under normal circumstances I'd have rated it a solid 7 stars, but given the historical significance of this long overdue release, I'm rating it a generous 8 stars. Of course don't take my words for it, so check it out and draw your own conclusion.",False
11,5,"""Keep on chooglin'""",evening1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe classic voices in this band brought me back to being 13 in Pittsburgh. Funny the way music enables time travel...I hadn't realized that Creedence Clearwater Revival was second only to the Beatles in worldwide popularity; that's what we're told here.I'd also been clueless as to the lyrics in the songs. Thanks to close-captioning on my TV, I saw that CCR actually offered some social commentary in those days of anti-Vietnam War sentiment, as in ""It ain't me -- I ain't no fortunate one...I see the bad moon rising, I see trouble on the way...""Early in the documentary, I was thinking the songs all sounded alike. But as it drew me in, I found that the whole was greater than the parts.Well worth experiencing, for the wistfulness of yesterday.",True
12,9,Excellent,Delby_Welby,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first half of this documentary is interesting. I loved getting a history of the band and seeing some footage from their first trip to Europe. I always find band histories fascinating, when done well. I wouldn't say this part of the documentary is top notch but it's done well enough to be enjoyable.Where this really gets into its stride is with the concert footage from London. I thought I'd end up skipping for later as generally, I don't watch concerts on TV. And I was tired. But I was hooked, and ended up rewatching some parts of it. The simple raw performance of four musicians churning out great song after great song for 45 minutes was absolutely brilliant. I loved it and would recommend it as one of the best concerts I've ever seen on TV.",False
13,10,The real world!,docalanking,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sensational. I listen to Creedence as part of a regular routine. Like breathing, it's an automatic bodily function!!!The lyrics & sounds has & continues to be relevant and a class of its own.This doco was an awesome travel back in time to a time where Creedence rules the world of rock - the greatest of all times. The doco shows true artists who were not making music for $$$ and self promotion but for making music for the pure love of music. The lead up to the final concert gives a highly entertaining but captivating, informative insight not only of Creedence but where the world was at the time!Just loved it and it was the best doco I've seen having listened to Creedence since was 11 and 47 years on, it still rocks & lifts my soul. Well done!!!",False
14,9,"Great concert, not so much a documentary",bjhex1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Clearly the intention of the filmmakers was to release concert footage of Creedence Clearwater Revival at the Royal Albert Hall. I can't attest to the full running time of the concert, but it seems as if the filmmakers also felt the need to pad out time with a fair amount of backstory for the band, as well as some candid video interviews of the band touring Europe. All this is well and good, but having the backstory of the band, without the aftermath, leaves the whole enterprise feeling a bit uneven as a documentary film.This is not to say I necessarily wished for the whole sordid breakup and litigation to be rehashed. But it leaves the film in a kind of limbo. On the one hand, being a wonderful concert presentation, with a lot of upward trajectory of the band, but on the other and unfinished story abruptly ending on an ominous (at least to CCR fans) high note.Well worth watching for the concert alone, even if we know the ending is bittersweet.",False
15,8,Love CCR!!,awvknj,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was a great trip back into the origins of this iconic band. The only thing missing was the rest of the story and I would enjoy a documentary that covered that as well as the solo career of John
But it wedded my whistle I'll be listening to CCR on Apple Music today while I'm working around the house timeless groove and still relevant to our times today!Now I am BD wants me to continue to say stuff about this documentary when I really don't have anything else to say but I have to come up with something in order to post this review so that is what you're getting now. 24 more characters required.",True
16,10,Look and listen,michaelRokeefe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNarrated by Jeff Bridges, insights of a legendary band at Royal Albert Hall. John, Tom, Doug and Stu may not be as well known as John, Paul, George and Ringo, but they set the music world on its ear. Creedence Clearwater Revival led by lead singer and writer John Fogerty made the country listen to swamp rock. Three hit albums in 1969 and a total of four produced 11 top ten hits. We have a few here like, ""Proud Mary"", ""Lookin' Out My Back Door"", Lodi"", ""Who'll Stop The Rain"", ""Fortunate Son"", "" ""Born On The Bayou"" and Travelin' Band"". Fogerty will share his songwriting style. A don't miss concert!",True
17,5,Not a documentary,lazlovandor,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile Netflix is ""selling"" this production as a documentary, you get just what they tell you in the title: CCR in the Royal Albert Hall.So, 10+ for CCR but I'm giving just 5/10 for this production. I expected a DOCUMENTARYThe so called documentary is just some photos and comments about their earliest years and that's ok but not enough.Some afterwords at the end about CCR will tell you about being by default, after The Beatles were gone, the greatest band by the end of 1971, and that's quiet true. But by 1972 they were gone.Why they disbanded at the top of their glory? What happened to CCR? Why they disappeared?What happened to John Fogerty? What happened with Fogerty's creativity? Being the author of most of CCR's biggest hits, he produced only one more or less significant song, The Old Man Down the Road, in 1984, accused by by producer Saul Zaentz being a plagiarism... of his own ""Run Through the Jungle""Probably most of the public doesn't know about his unique case of auto-plagiarism which reached the US Supreme Court.After he won his case, his main repertory were still his CCR's hits.Meanwhile the so called documentary covers only their concert. Assigning just 15 minutes to the movie as the epilogue of CCR might have given it the real documentary touch and not just a music video.",True

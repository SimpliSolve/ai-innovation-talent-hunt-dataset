1,8,Solid show,everetta-83243,n/a,16/08/2025,They only have so much to work with since the tracks are overgrown. Bringing in former drivers to speak and using old footage adds to the show greatly. Solid casual viewing that can be nostalgic for older fans and a learning experience for newer fans and older fans alike. 8/10.,False
2,9,A must watch,aaronmills-02441,n/a,16/08/2025,I loved watching this show seeing all the old track being calmed my nature and all the history and good memory's as those tracks gave people. There definitely should be season 2.,False

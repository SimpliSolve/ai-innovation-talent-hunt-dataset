1,10,Really great documentary,Frantic07,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found this to be the best take on the Fentanyl crisis of any documentary done so far on this horrible drug. Really honest interviews. I saw it on Youtube. Not sure why, but it was taken down. I hope at least for good reason, because it's an amazing documentary and is important for people to see. Something like this should be spread as much as possible.",False
2,10,They've done it again!,Spursy13,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another eye opening documentary from Hide & Seek Media. I love the honesty of the interviews and the way the interviewer conducts himself to get such good answers. This documentary is evidence that drug addiction is not a criminal issue, but a public health issue. Highly recommended watch!",False
3,10,It is too easy to judge,ilprofcontact,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this, and my heart went out to everyone on the show. Drug addiction really is an illness and can be triggered by accident.For many years I smoked marijuana, then I found out there were legal highs! Stronger (so I needed less) and legal (so I avoided criminals). No one told me that it was more addictive than crack cocaine.I am clear of all of that (apart from an alcohol issue I am dealing with), I do not even smoke cigarettes any more..But this shows that good people can make bad choices. They should be helped, not vilified.It is a documentary that should be seen by everyone.For very good apparent reasons, people can make stupid mistakes. My mistake was a way of saving money, and avoiding criminals.The physical and mental damage was horrific. Other than a serious application of willpower, and use of nicotine replacement, and (to be honest) alcohol, I would be dead.I am still using nicotine replacements. I am still drinking. But I managed to get off legal highs, before they were illegal.And the question is.... Am I some kind of street thug and general toerag? No, I am a professional and a lecturer at a couple of universities.... I have was lucky that I never touched opiates.So watch this, realise they the people shown in this documentary could be your mother, father, teacher, brother, sister or that nice chap at the end of the street who always says hello. Addiction was never their idea of a future.",False
4,10,This will stay with me a long time,siobhansbc,n/a,16/08/2025,"An extremely difficult watch and I think how are those people now. I genuinely continue to think and feel for all the people we meet who are suffering and in the grip of a drug that causes more damage than any gone before it. The torture in their eyes and their decimated bodies fills me with deep anguish.Yet again brings home how more needs to be done for those who self medicate for trauma suffered in a blind attempt to be like you and me. While lives are being lost to drugs every second of every day, watching this can I am in no doubt save lives.No one would choose this hell its just they thought it would save them or help them escape from the hellish turmoil they suffered before. This is not living, I am not sure is it even existing.",False
5,1,This documentary is infuriating,lfreeze,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is infuriating. The narrative and mindset presented in this documentary is the very reason the opioid crisis has exploded into what it is today. We need tough love solutions with a recovery first mindset. People can and do recover from addiction. It is beyond deplorable to encourage and enable people to suffer and die in the streets, while providing them the tools to do so and calling it compassion. There were about 5 honest, raw minutes taken from this documentary that show you from the addict's perspective and the dealer's perspective how incredibly destructive this narrative is for these people- to keep them sick and suffering.",False

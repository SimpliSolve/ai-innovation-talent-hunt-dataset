1,1,"If you are faithful, RUN from this series.",BrianJ-82,n/a,15/08/2025,"I understand creative discretion when making biblically based movies; they will never be completely accurate because some artistic license is usually needed to put the Bible accounts into movie form. However, when it comes to utterly defaming the Bible in a supposedly biblical series, I take issue with it, and this series does. One major example of this in this series, is a simply unforgivable conversation where Jesus says ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the Inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men."" This may sound familiar, to someone who doesn't know the Bible, as Ezekiel 25:17, BUT, it only sounds familiar because they quoted Samuel L Jackson's hitman character Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction quoting a FICTIONAL Ezekiel 25:17 Bible verse (supposedly authored by Jackson and Tarantino) just before murdering several people. This series has taken a false Bible verse, created for an assassin's pre-murder dialogue, and inserted it as words of wisdom from Jesus Christ. This alone should make any faithful Christian never watch this series.",False
2,3,Not bad if you're not concerned with accuracy.,StaceyB-9,n/a,15/08/2025,"Doesn't follow scripture.Just another Jesus story trying to capture the essence of the times.The political climate is fairly accurate but the inaccurate details are too distracting to make it worth watching.The documentary itself is made for Protestant consumption, and although it does get some scripture accurate, it almost seems like it purposely mis-quotes the biblical teachings in an effort to insult the Catholic Church. For example, it goes to a lot of trouble to state that Jesus had siblings. This is a mistake is made by those who have a very low level knowledge of theology, as it overlooks the facts that the Hebrew translation for brother actually means close family member, not literally ""brother "". This would be a better argument if Jesus had not given his Mother to John the beloved disciple from the cross. If Jesus had brothers, this would not only be unnecessary, but would also go against cultural norms.If the creator of the documentary would have not tried so hard to insult Catholicism, it might have been better.",False

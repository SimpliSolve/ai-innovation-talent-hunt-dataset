1,8,A worthwhile documentary advocating for sex education,chong_an,n/a,16/08/2025,"A 30-something out gay man explores sex, sexuality, silence, and shame in North American culture. Attempting to demystify the subject, he travels around North America, meeting educators, researchers, and naysayers. The film is bookended with interviews with his parents.The thrust of this film is to encourage more information and non- judgemental discussion with children about sex, by parents and educators, rather than shame and prohibition that commonly occurs. The director mentions his favorite band Salt-N-Pepa, though not directly their song ""Let's Talk About Sex"".",False
2,6,Fun,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA Sexplanation is just your typical queer, Asian American, comedic sex education documentary about the universal search for love, connection and family acceptance. It's also the story of 36-year-old health reporter Alex Liu and his quest to uncover the naked truths, hard facts and no small amount of awkward moments.As he makes conversation with psychologists, sex researchers and even a Jesuit priest, Alex explores why sex has always caused him - and so much of America - so much shame. After all, he learned that only abstinence would make him a good person, which suppressed his sexuality and made the fact that he was gay very troubling for him.As he learns that comprehensive sex education is the answer, he also finds out that it's finally time to have the talk with his parents.Liu, who directed and co-wrote this movie with Leonardo Neri, said ""A Sexplanation follows my quest to confront my sex education - by finally getting a real one.Growing up, sex felt shameful. My parents never brought it up. School focused on disease, pregnancy, and abstinence. By my 30s, I was surprised by how much shame I still carried. After talking with friends, I realized I wasn't alone.The film documents my attempt to strip away this shame, no matter how awkward it might get - even masturbating in an MRI machine (for science!).Through honest conversations with scientists, educators, and even my parents, I try to uncover some naked truths and hard facts that will get us to a healthier, sexier future.""Alex is a funny guy and he takes what should be a subject that makes people blush at best and upset at worst and treats it with kindness and humor. This documentary moves so quickly and gets across some great information. It could even be a weekly show and I'd watch every episode. The graphics and editing highlight the main points of the movie too.",True
3,10,Wonderful!,riksnilbaj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wonderful interviews and research! How much I needed this as a kid, an adolescent, a young adult, an adult, a middle aged man, an old man (now at 64!)! I can't even imagine how much I missed out in life because of lack in sexual education! Am I normal? Am I bad? Am I attractive? Why do I like this and they tell me it is bad??? How can anybody realize their own gifts when they're taught that these questions are bad. I wasted so many years and opportunities for good sex because I was taught that sex was bad, except to make babies! Bodies are beautifully and wondrously made! I love being human and a sexual being!",False

1,5,"Entertaining at times, comical at others",axervzye,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary has some interesting cases. Out of the four suspected DB Cooper suspects two seem very credible, while the other two, especially the sex change operation one...are very laughable. The most credible story with sound evidence is Richard McCoy. He pulled off a stunt identical to DB Coopers months after the heist and even looked just like the FBI description of DB Cooper. They went into good detail on why McCoy would have done a second stunt and explained how he was tied to what little evidence the FBI had on DB Cooper.The other credible story is the woman from Florida who supposedly was married to DB Cooper. He was on his death bed when he admitted to her he was DB Cooper. He lied to her about his identity and it goes into great detail on events in her life with him that pointed out he very well could have been the real Cooper. She also had a compadre who was interested in the Cooper story who did some serious sleuthing to pin point her details and memory while living with him that really did add up to the Cooper case.The other two lousy stories consist of a woman who claims her uncle was DB Cooper and the other of a man who had a sex change operation and just claimed he was DB Cooper. The woman who claims her uncle was DB Cooper was going off on memory about her childhood of an event where her uncle showed up bloody and bruised with claims of having hijacked an airplane. Yet, he disappeared and was just forgotten about by the family for some reason? It was all really shoddy information and didn't seem legit. Then she forget about this seemingly very profound event in her life until her father was close to his death when he brought up about the time her uncle hijacked a plane. She also claimed her uncle was her favorite relative and liked spending time with him. So after he shows up bloody and bruised and disappears you just forgot about him? Seems really bizarre and none of it really added up. They did a polygraph test on her and she passed...take that for what you will.The man with the sex change operation didn't even seem like it should have been included on this documentary. It seemed like a story you'd find in a fan fiction tv forum board versus anything the FBI would have taken seriously. Bobby Dayton was a man who knew airplanes and flew them on a regular basis. Further on in his life he decided to get a sex change operation and became Barbara Dayton. During this transitional period a couple who were into planes as well met Barbara and became friends. During a visit at this couples house she out of the blue says she is DB Cooper. Thats basically it, thats the entire story. Other then the fact he/she was well versed with airplanes nothing else is included for evidence. Other than a diary that Barbara kept but for whatever reason around the time of the Cooper hijacking didn't write much down during that period. If my memory serves me right it was the only one out of the four suspects where it mentioned nothing about the FBI looking into it and for good reason.Over all use your own judgement on it. It's a documentary with two good cases that kept me entertained.",False
2,7,Uncle,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Nearly 50 years have passed and it remains the only unsolved Air Piracy case in America. For HBO, documentarian John Dower (MY SCIENTOLOGY MOVIE, 2017) chronicles the investigation and four main suspects in the mystifying D.B. Cooper case. It's a case that has fascinated people and frustrated authorities for five decades.On November 24, 1971 - Thanksgiving Eve - a man using the name Dan Cooper (a communication mix-up caused him to be later identified as D.B. Cooper) boarded a Northwest Airlines flight in Portland. Once in the air, he handed Flight Attendant Tina Mucklow a note informing that he had a bomb and was hijacking the plane. His demands were simple: $200,000 in cash and 4 parachutes. In Seattle, his demands were met. He released the passengers, keeping only the crew on board. At an altitude of 10,000 feet, Cooper jumped from the Boeing 727 under the cover of darkness and rain over a heavily forested area. As far as authorities are concerned, he's never been seen again.Some presume he died on the jump, while others turned him into a folk hero.
He was credited with an act of defiance during times of economic hardships for many. The ""Cult of Cooper"" was born, as was one of the great mysteries of the 20th century. Director Dower interviews some key folks and shows clips of interviews and statements of interested parties who have since passed. The structure of the film revolves around the four main suspects ... those who have not been ruled out. Segments are devoted to each of the four: Duane Weber, Robert/Barb Dayton, LD Cooper, and Richard McCoy.Personal testimony and recollections from relatives and associates of these four leave us with little doubt that a case can be made for each, and those going on camera absolutely believe ""theirs"" is the infamous DB Cooper. We hear from Duane Weber's wife who states her husband confessed, ""I'm Dan Cooper"" on his death bed. Robert/Barb Dayton was one of the first me to have a sex change operation, and his neighbors provide details on Dayton's own confession, ""I am Dan Cooper"". Marla Cooper was 8 years old when the hijacking even took place, and she recalls specifics of her Uncle LD Cooper, and being told ""We hijacked the plane"" and ""We're rich!"" Lastly, Richard McCoy was arrested 5 months later for a copycat hijacking. His pattern was quite similar and his facial features almost identical to the DB Copper sketch.Tina Mucklow was the flight attendant on the hijacked flight and she provides details of that fateful event, as do other members of the flight crew, a passenger who observed most of what happened on the first flight, and a retired FBI agent who worked the case. Two authors, Bruce Smith (""DB Cooper and the FBI: A Case Study of America's Only Unsolved Skyjacking"", 2016) and Geoffrey Gray (""Skyjack: The Hunt for DB Cooper"", 2011) provide significant insight into the research they have conducted into the investigations. There seems to be plenty of criticism of the FBI in regards to lost evidence (cigarette butts from the flight, fingerprints), and a delayed ground search that gave Cooper a 40 hour head start.Some reenactments are used here, but a significant portion is filmed interviews with those who have something to say about the investigation, or who DB Cooper might be. The 1980 discovery of 3 bundles of cash with matching serial numbers on the banks of the Columbia River is discussed, and a possible explanation is provided in one of the segments. It's likely you'll come away from this as baffled as the authorities have been for 50 years, but also loaded with some good fodder for holiday conversation (via Zoom, of course).",False
3,7,A Very Interesting Unsolved Mystery!,WalkdenEntertainment,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Mystery of D.B. Cooper is a Documentary about one of the biggest aeroplane heists in history. It was November 1971 and a man known as DB Cooper hijacked a plane flying out of Portland, Oregon. How did he do it? A stranger boarded a plane and handed a note to a female flight attendant advising that a hijacking was about to occur. The flight attendant quickly learnt that the stranger was not mucking around as his briefcase contained explosives. After demanding a large ransom involving cash, DB Cooper was successful with the heist and parachuted out of the hijacked 727 at 10,000 feet over Washington State. No trace of him was ever found. A massive manhunt was conducted by many people including the military, FBI and even Boy Scouts. In the present day, the case is still the only unsolved act of air piracy in American history. Sure, there are many suspects and theories but not enough to ever bring the case to a full closure.This documentary rehashes the main event, re-enacted by actors and narrated by the real people who were present during the heist, including flight attendants and even the pilots. The film also includes interviews from various people who feel they know who the real DB Cooper is. There are even interviews with people who have written books about the heist or those who have devoted their lives to looking for clues trying to close the case. Several facts and evidence are also shown and discussed throughout the film.The pacing of this documentary for the most part was quite pleasing. I did notice the runtime and found it a slight struggle as the documentary attempted to wrap up and deliver a conclusion. Visuals are great and the quality of interviews were also very pleasing. As a true story, I will confess, I had no idea about this heist, so I found watching this documentary from the start to finish extremely fascinating and insightful.Overall, those who enjoy documentaries about unsolved true stories will certainly find this pleasing. A story of a man who conducted a heist on a large plane and then parachutes out with no trace of him is certainly a story that fascinated me. It is unfortunate that the documentary can't reveal all the details and that the final conclusion will be left up to its viewers. Pacing for the most part is pleasing and the quality of this documentary, including the film's visuals and interviews, are also quite positive. Overall, this documentary comes highly recommended.7.4/10 - Walkden Entertainment",False
4,n/a,An interesting angle on what keeps the public interested in this famous case,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This HBO doc may be the umpteenth look at the famous 1971 Hijacking case, but, Director John Dower takes an interesting enough to keep one watching. While the basics of the case are laid out (including interviews with the stewardess and a co-pilot on the flight), Dower is more interested in fleshing out how some of the suspects in the crime have effected their family and friends left behind. Others who have investigated the case on their own are also profiled.
The Documentary focuses on four suspects (all deceased) from the many who have had the finger pointed at them over the decades. While their stories are all different, what unites them is that those who were close to them are all convinced that their husband/uncle/friend/acquaintance is THE D.B. Cooper (one even took a lie detector). None of the investigators seem convinced that there is one correct answer, including one who believes Cooper died because of the rough terrain he would have landed in.
Dower isn't really interested in finding out who did it (or, even in debunking the claims of the interviewees), but more in the psychology of the various witnesses: What makes them keep the story alive? Why do they feel compelled to tell their story? Why do they insist that you believe their version of events? None of these questions is fully fleshed out, and that lack of answers will frustrate many viewers (others will be puzzled why the several other suspects aren't even cited).
THE MYSTERY OF D.B. COOPER isn't the definitive Doc on the subject, but, it's a casually interesting look at how the story has remained in the consciousness for close to four decades.",False
5,7,What the heck,brandonneicke,n/a,16/08/2025,5 suspects really? They all seem like they did it and they all basically confessed. How can the flight attendant not look at the 5 pictures and know exactly who she spent all that time with. They don't even show that ladies opinion on the 5 suspects. I give it 7 only because there is still lots of facts and cool info about the actually highjack,False
6,6,Decent film that is misleading,whitelynx-713-688294,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film is made decently enough, nothing to complain.However, it features a series of misleading statements (e.g. The stairs story) and omissions (Cooper wasn't the gentleman he's always said to be, and many other things are simply untrue).Most, if not all, of these suspects have conclusively been ruled out long ago.Watch it for entertainment but don't take it for gospel. If you want to research the case you are better off on YouTube (I hate to recommend that), and forums dedicated to the case.Like a lot of movies, they just took whatever they could to tell ""a story"", not more, not less.",False
7,7,Pretty interesting!,kellyq12,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary taught me way more than I ever knew about DB Cooper. The highlights are the interviews with the pilots, flight attendant, and a passenger who were on board the hijacked flight. The film also lays out several suspects as to who the real DB Cooper could be... You decide!",False
8,7,The One To See,AudioFileZ,n/a,16/08/2025,"The only unsolved aircraft hi-jacking in American history still fascinates much as it has done for the past half-century. In fact the only thing that exceeds the top suspects is the shear number of movies, TV shows, and documentaries on the subject. Without DNA evidence this dead case will never be solved and remain in the realm of popular culture. That said this is the one to watch. It focuses only on the most likely suspects which hindsight clarifies. As one who has watched plenty of shows on Cooper over the years I not only founuge d The Mystery of D. B. Cooper to be about the best of the lot. It entertains while I learned of several facts I wasn't aware of jpreviously. Frustratingly though, in the end, the big questions of who Dan Cooper was and if he survived remain.",False
9,5,DB Confusion,dti812,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was enjoyable at best, ridiculous at worst and falls somewhere in the middle, hence my score of 5.
More like 4+, but I digress.
As some other reviewers mentioned the story of Bob / Barbra was by far the most absurd and should not have been included. The man and wife who tell the story said Barb got very agitated when he said ""oh your DB Cooper"" but then at some future point in time still allowed him to comb her hair, put sunglasses on and take her picture to show the resembalance to Cooper, a picture that was then destroyed? Not buying it.
The niece's story was comprised of suppressed memories, so I do not find them credible. I do not think she or the women in Florida or any of the people were lying as some people have suggested. I think they are remembering things the way they want to, or the way that fits their particular narrative.
The copycat hijacker seemed most plausible to me. But why did he have a gun on the second flight when no mention of a gun was brought up on the first flight. Also I would have liked to have the stewardess and the college student from the first flight give their impression of if they thought Floyd was Dan Cooper.
Raises more questions than it answers but added some new twists I had not heard before. Not bad for a rainy day when nothing is on.",False
10,8,An oddly endearing and quite entertaining documentary,jake_fantom,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watch a lot of documentaries, and lately find that I am enjoying fewer and fewer of them. This one was an exception. It's in the style of some of the Errol Morris films, very fluid, not committing to a narrative, letting the story lead where the story leads. We're in the company of actual participants in the DB Cooper drama (flight attendants, co-pilots, passengers, FBI agents), plus an odd assortment of characters who claim to have known the real DB Cooper and the real story of what happened to DB and the money he parachuted out of the plane with on a rainy night somewhere over Oregon. It all adds up to a fascinating 90 minutes or so of immersive cinema that recalls a world far removed from the one we live in today. Highly recommended despite the fact that a few benighted reviewers just don't seem to get it.",False
11,4,Just watch Lemmino's YouTube video instead,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"How do you make such an interesting subject this boring?The ""who"" is less interesting when it's something that can never be resolved. The better approach would have been focusing on what drives these people to obsess about the case, and hold onto the theories that they do; something like the documentary on The Shining fan theories (Room 237).It's presented decently enough, and didn't offend or anger me... it was just dull, really.There's a 30-minute YouTube video by Lemmino on DB Cooper that's an hour shorter than this and far more interesting.",False
12,5,Robert Rackstraw anyone?,jasoninthe-23520,n/a,16/08/2025,One of the most notorious suspects not mentioned even once in the film. Casts doubt on the film's credibility. Thumbs down,False
13,8,Entertaining,JonanthanNewOrleans,n/a,16/08/2025,"Highly entertaining if you watch it as fun entertainment and not as a science show with die hard facts, because some of the people are obviously lying.Recommend strongly , 8/10",False
14,n/a,Total BS,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I lasted halfway through this garbage. This is pablum for the masses. Lots of people spouting gibberish. A TOTAL waste of time.This is WHY, we can't have ""nice things.""This is manufactured. Seriously.Try HARDER, DOC MAKERS.",False

16,1,Good documentary on a pathetic premise,franbraithwaitespam,n/a,16/08/2025,"While it is a beautifully constructed documentary, the content is disappointing.What comes across is a bunch of desperate men who have spent their lives trying to solve a mystery and clutching at any straw the possible can. It's actually really sad watching these pathetic men who want their lives to mean something. I actually feel empathy for these men who have wasted their lives to no result. Great doco for people who are easily convinced or conspiracy theorists.",False
17,9,HAS ANYONE INVESTIGATED SONNY BONO?,Sigmund_Schadenfreude,n/a,16/08/2025,"Appearing in Airplane II would have been the perfect coverCooper isn't as well known outside the US and by subsequent generations, so all this was new information, to me, and the documentary does a good job of establishing the basic facts as well as relating the unfolding events of the hijacking in entertaining fashionNone of the proposed suspects seem especially likely, but the purpose of those segments is to examine the enduring appeal of the mystery as well as why anyone would want to claim a relative or friend was the perpetratorThe most likely explanation seems that the hijacker died as a result of leaping in terrible weather and landing in rough terrain, but the way I initially resisted that conclusion and wanted to believe he pulled-off his elaborate caper made me understand why so many others are so willing to believe theories which don't stand up to much examinationA very thought provoking film...",False

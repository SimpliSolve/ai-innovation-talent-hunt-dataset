1,7,Interesting Look at the Dark Side of Hollywood,Reviews_of_the_Dead,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a documentary that my wife, Jaime, and I watched on a lazy Sunday. I've been loosely hooked on Vanderpump Rules thanks to friends. Jaime was intrigued to check it out so we've been binging it when we want mindless television. About a month back, we noticed this documentary being recommended due to me watching the reality show. Now that we were completely caught up, we decided to check this out.What I should interject here is that we knew a bit about what happened due to Lala Kent, who was engaged to marry the focus of this documentary. The clever title is in reference to Randall Emmet. We see her on the show giving information to her friends. It doesn't fully go into it so I was glad that this did.I think this doc is well done. It make sense that the Los Angeles Times is behind it. This is being told through investigative reporters as well as Lala's mother, Lisa Burningham, her brother, Easton, and people who were former assistants to Randall. It is harrowing to hear what these people say, the things they put up with before finally giving up. It is sad to hear how good Randall was and then doing the things that he did. There were signs from the beginning that if he got a taste of success, this could happen. It still doesn't mean he should get away with it.Now everything I'm saying is under the guise that I believe everything being said. Randall cheated on Lala so I believe her. I also think there were signs that she ignored. How she started her relationship being part of that. She isn't to blame in the least bit though either. I'm more referring to things she said to others on Vanderpump Rules. The things that Randall's assistants share and how this man treated Bruce Willis, I'm shocked he's still working in the industry.There isn't much more that I need to say. I'm glad I watched this to fill in the back-story to what we learn from that reality show. It is appalling. This is well-made though. The people that are interviewed are interesting. There is a personal feel through what is being shared. Not one that I can recommend to everyone though, as I don't know if you'd be interested. I would though to fans of Vanderpump Rules or anyone interested in the darker side of the business of making movies.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",False
2,1,Still waiting for the bad parts he did.,oseguera-18079,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerFrom what was seen it really didn't seem that bad. He basically sounds like every other a hole producer and director so where's the documentary on them? Imagine volunteering for a job knowing you're going to be working for scumbags in Hollywood and surprised you're treated as such. The only thing I found awful was the way he treated Bruce Willis which at the time had dementia but no one knew even the crew so can't really blame him on that. Lala should be the last person to criticize I'm more than positive she knew what was going on and just turned a blind eye to stick with the lifestyle. So again typical me too bs nonsense we've already seen.,True
3,8,A must-watch,muybueno16,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am not the crowd tp bother with either reality shows nor 20/20 type news specials but having followed this producer's various acclaimed and infamous movies, it was on my radar. I learned alot as the material covered in this doc went beyond what the headlines summed up and any entertainment filmbuff, documentary completist or True Crime fan would do best to seek it out.The scripting, editing, interviews and research is top-notch. I'n really disgusted by internet trolls claiming they don't see amything wrong here as it's clear they either didn't watch it or are pals of the depicted subject trying (and failing) to downplay his scandal. It really does fact check all angles of this rise and downfall while giving factoids on how this film producer had only himself to blame for his unusual exposure by going on his fiance's reality show, which in turn revealed his infamous gambling, all the actors he was tricking into being in his mid-budget movies and his other unprofessional office behavior which even got the Writer's Guild to recommend all union members avoid his unworkable atmosphere. If you want to learn about another Bernie Madoff or Cannon Films type entertainment mogul, this will fascinate as this guy is virtually an unusual combo of both infamous personas. It is still streaming on Hulu as of this review post and I couldn't recommend it more.",False

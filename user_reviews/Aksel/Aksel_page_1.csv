2,3,A shallow take on a legendary athlete,emilapa,n/a,17/08/2025,"A disappointing documentary about a truly legendary athlete. I was hoping for a more personal perspective on recovery from injury, the will succeed (and win), the sacrifices and the toll it takes, but this is more of a shallow showcase on Aksel's accomplishments and career. Some great shots of skiing, but that's about it. About as interesting as an episode of MTV Cribs if you know the story beforehand. A pretty awful and overly dramatic music score makes this turkey complete.",False

6,1,A distortion of the truth about India,paulatepc66,n/a,16/08/2025,Visually interesting and excellent photography in line with other programs in this series. If it is just geographical information you are interested in then it's good but it whitewashes the truth about the dreadful bias and awful treatment poor citizens in India are subject to and have been throughout history.OK the world has been and still is a cruel place for many but I dias treatment of the lowest Hindu classes is an international disgrace and should be subject to worldwide sanction.Especially damming in this film is the pretence that all Hindus can take part in the huge festivals that feature in this program.... No many cannot and extreme bias among higher ranking Hindus delays reform.Remake the film with more balanced description of reality and use it a a vehicle for reform rather than propaganda.,False

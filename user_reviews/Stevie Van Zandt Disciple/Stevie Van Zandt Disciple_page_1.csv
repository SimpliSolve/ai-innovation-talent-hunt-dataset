1,7,By any name ...,ferguson-6,n/a,17/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. The tagline is ""Artist. Activist. Renegade."", yet somehow after spending 2.5 hours watching this documentary from Bill Teck, we realize there is even more to Steve Van Zandt. Or maybe you know him as ""Miami Steve"" ... or even ""Little Steven"". Having accomplished so much through various avenues, we are left with nothing but respect for the man.Bruce Springsteen fans know him as Miami Steve of the East Street Band (and Bruce's longtime buddy). Other music lovers know him as the leader of Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul. Some remember him as the driving force behind the ""Sun City"" song and collaboration. Still others know him as an actor playing Tony's consigliere Silvio in ""The Sopranos"", or as a mobster in ""Lilyhammer"". What we learn is that he's also an incredibly talented songwriter, a highly sought-after producer and arranger, and he was the saving grace behind Springsteen's ""Tenth Avenue Freezeout"" on the breakout album. By any name, Van Zandt is not one to stand on his (many) past accomplishments.Documentarian Teck loosely breaks down the timeline of Van Zandt's life and, in keeping with the Disciple title, presents it in three 'Books': Salvation, Revolution, Revelations. Much of the run time is spent in Book I, where we recap the early days of Asbury Park, New Jersey, and local venue, The Stone Pony. Some incredible clips are included showing live performances of Southside Johnny, Van Zandt, and of course, Springsteen. It's also here where we learn the origin of the nickname ""Miami Steve"". It didn't take long for Van Zandt's extraordinary talent as an arranger to shine through, and his ambition and creative forces drove him to leave the E Street Band in 1983 to form his own identity. It's also in this stage where he married Maureen in a ceremony officiated by none other than music icon Little Richard (video), and including singer Percy Sledge.Book II recounts Steven's foray into activism and political activities, namely Apartheid in South Africa. He wrote the song ""Sun City"" and organized the iconic participants of the movement that ultimately contributed to the release of Nelson Mandela. As impressive as his efforts were, and as respected as he was, Van Zandt readily admitted, ""I don't want to be a politician.""
Aptly named Book III: Evolution took Van Zandt to 1999, where not only did he reconnect with Springsteen and rejoin the E Street Band, he also accepted creator David Chase's offer to take a role in ""The Sopranos"". That's a pretty good year. It's in Book IV: Revelations where Van Zandt originated his popular radio show, ""Little Steven's Underground Garage"", where he keeps rock history alive, and he also brought 1960's band The Rascals to Broadway. In 2021, Van Zandt's memoir, ""Unrequited Infatuations"" was published. Did I mention this isn't a man to sit back and chill?Bill Teck solidifies the admiration Van Zandt has by including interviews with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, Southside Johnny, Dion, Gary US Bonds, Mike Stoller, Darlene Love, wife Maureen, Peter Gabriel, Eddie Vedder, Bono, Joan Jett, Jackson Browne, Reuben Blades, Jon Landau, and David Chase. The interviews and clips and photographs are well done, plus he allows Van Zandt to contribute his own thoughts. This is terrific insight, and the film ends perfectly showing Bruce and Steve teaming up for ""No Surrender"".Airing on HBO and streaming on MAX beginning June 22, 2024.",False
2,8,An Awesome Documentary,mchl88,n/a,17/08/2025,"I devoured Steve Van Zandt's autobiography Unrequited Infatuations a number of years ago so I was anxious to see this.It did not disappoint.Van Zandt has led an interesting rock and roll life. While he never achieved his ""Boss'"" success, he can be credited for trading on his name for activism. And though it cost him dearly, he eventually had a second act as an actor in my favorite television show.The mark of a documentary like this is who they can get to participate by being interviewed. Besides Bruce, there are numerous people who weigh in here. Everyone from Eddie Vedder to Darlene Love and from Paul McCartney to David Chase. That made for an compelling documentary and one I highly recommend.",False
3,9,Must see,f-evers,n/a,17/08/2025,"Just go watch it.If you love the Sopranos: watch it! Haven't even finished that part yet however it was the main reason to start watching in the beginning.If you love Bruce Springsteen: watch it! How they grew up musically is not possible anymore so that is a great thing to watch.If you love change or how to accomplish it: watch it! Getting thanked by Nelson Mandela himself, getting conscious that it is possible to make a change to the world is heartwarming. He did make a change. Laid a foundation for lots of music and he should always be remembered for this.Great man. Also great on twitter ðŸ˜‚",False
4,10,"WATCH IT, TRUST ME!!",suss5656,n/a,17/08/2025,"For anyone that is a fan of the subject matter, this is a Must See!!Even if you're just a Bruce fan, and don't really care about the history, you will find it interesting.I never really knew that much about Steven Van Zandt, just knew that he was in the E Street band. I had no idea why he left the E Street band, I just thought, at the time, that he was crazy!This documentary fills in so many blanks, and gives you a newfound respect for Little Steven, Miami Steve, Steven Van Zandt!!He has accomplished so much and many of us know nothing about it.Not a slow or boring moment in the nearly two and a half hours.It was excellent, truly well done and there was tons of surprising information.",False
5,10,Great ! Loved it ! Every second !,nicktusk-95591,n/a,17/08/2025,I don't read this great review and bias and the fact that I'm a diehard Sopranos fan. But had I never seen the Sopranos I never would've heard of little Steve. I'm a 80s baby but growing up in my garage as a five-year-old kid my dad played the living sh$t out of Bruce Springsteen born in the USA. All that comes back all the nostalgia everything that Steve did in his career even the political stuff with South Africa was very reminiscent and even the sopranos being over 20 years ago it's amazing this guy's career. I don't think there's anybody on planet Earth that has much diversity with longevity of creative talent and abilities. Granted he's not the most successful musician Director or actor out there but the stuff that he's done is like miraculous. Sort of a Forrest Gump type trajectory no pun intended obviously but the life Steve has is just remarkable.,False
6,8,Stevie Van Zandt: Disciple,Prismark10,n/a,17/08/2025,"For years, Stevie Van Zandt to me was Bruce Springsteen's sidekick who had some dodgy screeching vocals. He later co-produced the Boss's later albums before departing just as Bruce hit paydirt with the Born in the USA album.Stevie was not part of the lucrative Born in the USA touring band. Instead he got involved in political activism such as raising awareness about Apartheid in South Africa. It culminated in the supergroup Artists United Against Apartheid with the song Sun City. Although it was a minor hit, its impact was more felt in the USA.This documentary shows that Stevie actually had nice vocals in his younger days. He was soulful and an aficionado of rock, pop and rhythm and blues music and anything in between.He was a consigliere to Bruce, the most important member of the E Street Band. Later becoming the consigliere Silvio Dante in the television show The Sopranos.This sprawling but comprehensive documentary showed various chapters in his life. From rock star, to political activist to television actor to radio show disc jockey.Stevie Van Zandt has lived a multi faceted life. I always judge these documentaries on whether I have learned new things about the subject.Given that I have known of him since the 1980s. I learned a lot of new things about Stevie Van Zandt.Bruce Springsteen mentions that Stevie is either all in or nothing type of guy. I would had liked to hear more from his fellow E Street band members though.",False
7,8,Entertaining and revealing.,allmoviesfan,n/a,17/08/2025,"Of course, I knew Miami Steve / Little Stevie / Stevie Van Zandt from his days with the E Street Band and a couple of notable TV shows, but it wasn't until I sat down to watch this doco that I realised what sort of an impact the man has had on rock music - and what a varied career he's had.Also, does anyone else think he bears more than a passing resemblance to KISS' Paul Stanley?The documentary intersperses fascinating footage of Van Zandt right back to his formative years with stories told by the men and women who know him best from all sides (including Springsteen, Sir Paul McCartney, Maureen Van Zandt, Eddie Vedder and more)and, of course, plenty from Stevie himself. It's a very enlightening doco, from start to finish.Springsteen, the Sopranos, political activism, ""Home Alone"" music, Little Steven's Underground Garage and more...it's all here.Fascinating.",False
8,2,It's AWFUL,crashsc-89537,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI actually thought this was a mockunentary. It's not, but it really is. It starts off ok. I was interested at first as a music lover. But somewhere after the first hour, the wheels fall off the bus. This is when it turns into a mockumentary. The next hour and a half is full of nothing but Steven telling you how great he is and every little thing he has done in his life. He does not miss one moment! And then you are stuck in his activist era for what seems like eternity! All I really wanted to hear about was him playing Silvio Dante. I didn't even know who he was before the Sopranos. And after you watch this love letter to himself, your vib to wonder what kind of money they had to pay these people for these obviously scripted interviews. The kicker is, they're really good actors! If you've read the other reviews, you will quickly know his PR team wrote them all, except mine. Mine is an honest review. Good luck, folks.",True
